      <li>My best friend is a stylist at a fancy salon, this past summer I was asking her about beach sprays and she recommended I try this.  </li>
      <li>Once I add some great hairspray, my waves and curls stay around all day long!  </li>
      <li>It leaves my hair looking clean and full.</li>

      <li>: I have very straight medium thickness hair.</li>
      <li>I prefer using it when my hair is just about dry to create some light waves (versus a very tousled, beachy look which I have not been able to achieve with this).  </li>

      <li>I love to use this product as a dry shampoo.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery.</li>
      <li>and I find that this product works very well.  </li>
      <li>I have very wavy hair</li>
      <li>It works very well as a sea salt spray, as well.</li>
      <li>but for real, it&#x27;s a curse.</li>
      <li>I will then use Kerastase Laque Dentelle Micro Mist Fixing Flexible Hold Hair Spray to lightly spray the twist for some extra hold.</li>
      <li>Stands up to humidity very well.</li>
      <li>You may have to gently break the twists apart after shaking your hair out.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t remember exactly how she explained it, but basically she said that because it uses minerals it gives your hair texture without weighing it down the way that the sea salt in most beach sprays will.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>) Holds a nice beach wave or curl, which is hard to accomplish with my hair type.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Sometimes I just use a curling iron to touch up a few strains of hair and it comes out even better than the day before.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
      <li>I will use a very light amount on my roots, comb it through my hair, let it dry, then touch my hair up with the flat iron.</li>

      <li>, you get better results), comb my hair then shake it out, part it 4 ways and twist each part (I will do this for bigger beach like curls, more twisted parts will give you smaller tighter curls).</li>
      <li>Then I dryed it completely, don&#x27;t brush or it will make your hair frizzy</li>
      <li>Without this product I need to wash my hair daily due to oil/limpness but if I apply this to towel-dried hair and blow dry, I can easily go 2-3 days between washings.</li>
      <li>I personally need a little more frizz control and a little</li>

    <li> Love this stuff! Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!! I have very long thick mostly straight hair that is layered and was looking for a hair product that would hold a curl, but still look natural. I love this product so much for the following reasons ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Holds a nice beach wave or curl, which is hard to accomplish with my hair type.&lt;br /&gt;2) The product is light and does not leave your hair feeling crispy or sticky.&lt;br /&gt;3) The next day can even look better! Sometimes I just use a curling iron to touch up a few strains of hair and it comes out even better than the day before.&lt;br /&gt;4) Saves me so much time in the morning!

From here you can either blow dry it or let it air dry while maintaining that twist.The tighter the hold on the twist while drying the more of a curl you get. Once dry, I bow my head down, shake my head around to break apart the twists, and massage my roots. You may have to gently break the twists apart after shaking your hair out. After all this my hair looks amazing. I get that full beachy curl I want and my hair is not even the slightest bit crispy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) You can comb out your hair the next day and use a flat iron to straighten your hair.

    <li> My best friend is a stylist at a fancy salon, this past summer I was asking her about beach sprays and she recommended I try this.  I can&#x27;t remember exactly how she explained it, but basically she said that because it uses minerals it gives your hair texture without weighing it down the way that the sea salt in most beach sprays will.  I&#x27;ve used beach sprays before and I have to say she was absolutely right.  I love how this adds texture to my hair all day, without making it weird or heavy.  It also lasts a long time and my hair even looks great and has a ton of body the following day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I style it: I spray some in my hair while wet and then blow dry, this is how my friend told me to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair type: I have very straight medium thickness hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product....I have very wavy hair and this product was made for this kind of hair!</li>
    <li> I love the beach hair look. I washed my hair, brushed my hair wet, then I uses Kerastase and sprayed all over my hair. Then I dryed it completely, don&#x27;t brush or it will make your hair frizzy, it looks great. In fact, the next day it look even better. A bonus is that is smells delicious!!!</li>
    <li> Costly products to learn that for my fine hair they do not work at all.  So very disappointed that this did not work</li>
    <li> Great and doesn&#x27;t make your hair crispy.</li>
    <li> This product gives my hair great texture and hold. Love it! Price beats salon price, too. Highly recommended. Prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> This spray was recommended to me by my stylist.  If i spray it on my towel-dried hair and use a diffuser, my hair is smashing!  I have thin hair that is borderline wavy/curly depending on the day.  Once I add some great hairspray, my waves and curls stay around all day long!  I wash my hair 1x-2x a week and condition daily, so i have not noticed a difference in my hair&#x27;s health.  I&#x27;m glad i can be happy with my hair EVERY time!</li>
    <li> If you like that &amp;#34;beachy&amp;#34; wind-swept look, this is for you!  Stays soft to the touch.  Paid a fortune for this at the salon - a great deal.</li>
    <li> This stuff has been on my radar for quite some time. Don&#x27;t know why it took me so long to get one  but I will never be without this spray in my arsenal again. I have the thickest, finest hair you can imagine. I know some people say that and yada yada but for real, it&#x27;s a curse. I can manipulate the top layer of my hair to do whatever I want usually but the middle layers and bottom layers generally maintain an annoying straightness no matter what I do. Until this miracle wave spray. I spray and twist and VOILA, it holds the twist! I didn&#x27;t think it was possible?! Thank you Kerastase!</li>
    <li> I used this product with the boucles d&#x27;art fixation and elixir to keep my curly hair tame. I use it on my wet curly hair and it holds through drying and the day. I also use it to touch up the curls the next day. Bonus is its fantastic scent!</li>
    <li> I purchased this in hopes to add volume to my very average hair.  I have a lot of hair, but the hairs themselves are on the thin side.  Product seemed to help add volume all over and held my style well.  It is pricey and in my opinion worked as well as a styling mouse might.  I am not a hair dresser so my styling technique may have prevented the product from working to it&#x27;s fullest potential.</li>
    <li> I would have given this product no stars if i could.  This product did not work for me at all.  Tried it with wet and dry hair and only made my hair frizzy.  I have curly hair that I usually use Paul Mitchell products on.  I tried this product after my friend gave it rave reviews.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells SOOOO good, I want to make love to my hair. It works very well as a sea salt spray, as well. Not too sticky or crunchy like some sprays.</li>
    <li> Makes hair a little crunchy and feel dry.  Still searching for my perfect tousled spray.</li>
    <li> I love this hair spray.  It lets your hair move but it still stays in place.  The best thing about it though is it smells great!</li>
    <li> This product smells great and does make your hair soft.  However, it&#x27;s pretty light in terms of hold.  I personally need a little more frizz control and a little more hold.  I prefer using it when my hair is just about dry to create some light waves (versus a very tousled, beachy look which I have not been able to achieve with this).  I do have long, very thick hair so it may work better on those with thinner locks.  Love the scent and would consider purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Just a spritz and run my fingers through my hair and I am good to go.  It is not &amp;#34;superglue&amp;#34; or sticky, just a puff of volume at the roots.  Stands up to humidity very well.</li>
    <li> This adds great volume to my fine, straight hair and even keeps it looking freshly styled the following day! Without this product I need to wash my hair daily due to oil/limpness but if I apply this to towel-dried hair and blow dry, I can easily go 2-3 days between washings. This is one product that&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I have always used kerastase products and was expecting the best from this one. I am disappointed. It might do the work as they claim it does, but the next day, my hair is clumped together, stiff and impossible to put together. I had hoped it would have extended my days between washing but really, it is impossible not to wash after one use and an overnight. Impossible to brush through even just with fingers.</li>
    <li> I have a fair amount of wavy fine hair and I find that this product works very well.  It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.</li>
    <li> the product was recommended by my hair dresser.  It works great for my hair adds curl to naturally curly hair and make it fuller without goo.  Leaves hair soft</li>
    <li> Very good hair spray that gives your hair that surfer look. My hair is curly and gavr it that unruly look but the shape maintains its look. A little pricy</li>
</ol>
