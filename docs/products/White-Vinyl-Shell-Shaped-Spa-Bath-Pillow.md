<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This pillow works great in our whirlpool bathtub.</li>
    <li> I ordered two of these and neither one would hold air.  I would not order them again.  They were inexpensive and you get what you pay for.  The company was very cooperative and sent two more pillows at no charge.</li>
    <li> My wife has a hard time finding a comfortable pillow for the tub.  We finally found this pillow on Amazon.com and it was exactly what she was looking for.  It was shipped quickly and we had it for her to use in two days.</li>
    <li> Does the job and is only vinyl, not terry cloth.</li>
    <li> Did not stay inflated long. Had to keep reinflating. The one i bought at BBB before seemed to be much better quality.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered these before as I have to have a pillow in the bath, as love to soak.  Never had any issues with losing air or anything, would recommend.</li>
    <li> Works fine. Deflated a bit with use.</li>
    <li> I ordered the White VINYL Shell Shaped Spa pillow and received a terry cloth pillow.  I was totally shocked because the packaging sticker identified is as being vinyl.  I am going to keep it to see if this will suit my needs, but I am very disappointed in the bait and switch that they have pulled on all of us who have ordered this product.</li>
    <li> What was received was not what was ordered!  I ordered vinyl bath pillow, which was described as 100% vinyl. We don&#x27;t want terry cloth because it has a tendency to mildew.  A stick-on tag on the outside of the package stated white vinyl bath pillow; however, the product inside was Spa Relaxus &amp;#34;Super Soft Terry Cloth Bath Pillow.&amp;#34;  How do I receive what was ordered.</li>
    <li> Got a hole within a week of purchase.</li>
    <li> This shell is a replacement for the pillow that we had previous to this one. It fulfills our requirement and is every bit as good as the one that it replaced.</li>
    <li> I ordered thi pillow for my daughter.  I was supposed to be the one without the cover.  It came with the cover.</li>
    <li> The bath pillow works fine once you have gotten in blown up.  It was extremely difficult to inflate compared to others we have had in the past.  Perhaps if you have a bicycle air pump it would be easier.</li>
    <li> very handy  we take it with use in vacations</li>
    <li> We have to blow this pillow up each time we use it.  Doesn&#x27;t hold air.</li>
    <li> I ordered a vinyl pillow and recieved this abomination in its place.  I wanted pure vinyl and ordered a vinyl pillow.  What I recieved was a terrycloth covered pillow (terrycloth doesn&#x27;t dry out!).  Package was &#x27;Super Soft Terry Cloth Bath Pillow&#x27; ... back of package was a sticker with a different brand (Mabis -- what I ordered).  It is not an acceptable substitute.  When reading reviews, I found that somebody else had the same problem; thus, this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, its an add-on item, so you can&#x27;t return using the normal channels -- you must connect customer service.  I&#x27;ve done that via e-mail and have not as yet been contacted about the return/exchange.  About 2 hours later:  I&#x27;ve gotten a label and return okay.  Still need a pillow.  Do I dare try again?</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted.  Arrived a day earlier than expected!</li>
    <li> Great bath pillow which is a must have for all bath lovers. I would recommend as I really enjoy it.</li>
    <li> Nice pillow, does the trick. Do not buy the terry covered ones, because they get so dirty.</li>
    <li> The bath pillows were bought as a part a  spa relaxation themed gift bag for a special ladies day I was hosting.  They were lovely and were well received by the ladies (all of them saying that it was just what they needed).  They&#x27;re great and greatly appreciated!</li>
    <li> This is an comfortable and sturdy pillow great for the price. I bought it to replace a cheapo purchased earlier that leaked almost immediately.</li>
    <li> After suffering the death of many less expensive bath pillows, finding this item brought me great joy. Of course they die, but we got close to 6 months out of the first one (used daily for ca. 45 min) and the second one has yet to leak air after 4 months of use. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> ------------ feels like plastic, looks like plastic, holds air.  it&#x27;s a white vinyl plastic bathtub or spa bath pillow for one&#x27;s tub.  my wife uses it . . .</li>
    <li> I, as other reviewers, got the terry cloth pillows and returned them for prompt refund.  Amazon gave me the manufacturer contact information.  Manufacturer just contacted me and apologized for the mix up and has promised to send me the correct (vinyl) pillows.  This review is to be continued if the manufacturer sends the correct pillows!</li>
    <li> I ordered this &#x27;vinyl&#x27; bath pillow because the description said VINYL and I wanted vinyl not terry cloth.  Unfortunately, the pillow sent was terry cloth!  Some of the other reviews said this happened to them also but I took my chances, hoping for the best.  I don&#x27;t get it...the description says one thing but you get something different.  On the positive side, I do have to say that the pillow is a nice size for the price.</li>
    <li> I was expecting an all-vinyl pillow. This one is not clearly described as having a cloth cover. I will use it, but I hope my hair doesn&#x27;t get wet from the terry cloth. It is, however, in all other respects, just what I was looking for,</li>
    <li> Valve will not stay closed, loses air as soon as you lie on it.  Terrible!</li>
    <li> This was a gift and she loves it. Her bath tub is too sharply angled and this somewhat little inflatable pillow takes care of the problem nicely. I thought it&#x27;d be a little bigger.</li>
