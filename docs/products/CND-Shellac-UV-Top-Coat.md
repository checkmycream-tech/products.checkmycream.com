      <li>I purchased this top coat thinking it was a gel polish.  </li>

      <li>I like how easily the top coat goes on, completes the process and looks sleek.</li>
      <li>I love shellac and it&#x27;s easy to do at home.  </li>
      <li>The top coat is goopy and does not go smoothly when it reaches 1/2 bottle.</li>
      <li>Also, make sure you keep this product away from the UV light.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about CND!  </li>
      <li>This is so cool!</li>
      <li>Easy to apply.</li>
      <li>CND goes on easy and comes off easy.</li>
      <li>Follow the directions for curing times between layers with the UV light</li>
      <li>fun!</li>
      <li>It goes on like nail polish and dries under the light so quickly.</li>
      <li>(Except for the trained professional part, the DIY nail painter is more than qualified!)</li>
      <li>It is very drying though so make sure you use nail oil every day.  </li>
      <li>i have the whole CND Shellac system so this top coat is a must.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t enjoy the removal process, but the savings is worth it.</li>
      <li>but after i figured it out how to use it very happy and it works just fine with reg polish and last very long</li>
      <li>Works great with other CND Shellac products.  </li>
      <li>Delivery was quick.</li>
      <li>I love how long it lasts and it&#x27;s really easy!</li>
      <li>It saves me so much money!!</li>
      <li>i recently purchased all the supplies to do shellac at home, and am loving it.</li>
      <li>It would nice if it came in smaller bottles.</li>
      <li>Its better than other top gel coat.</li>
      <li>i did a special-design french tip over romantique tonight, and am pleased with the results (my first stamped tips!).</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t forget to add some extra curing time under the UV light (two 2 min cycles) and clean off the sticky residue with 90% isopropyl alcohol for lots of shine.</li>
      <li>At first i didnt know how to use the gel</li>
      <li>My only downfall with all CND polishes is that I wish there was more in the bottle. :0)</li>
      <li>I will be ordering some more soon enough.</li>
      <li>This was my first try at using Shellac for my nails.  </li>
      <li>that last 14 or more days.  </li>
      <li>First time putting on Shellac on my nails.</li>
      <li>The best no chip top, base and polish.</li>
      <li>I am allergic to acrylics so at first I was very careful, but have not had any problems in the many months I have been using it.</li>
      <li>I really like the vinylux polish.</li>
      <li>This top coat worked exactly as described, was easy to apply a thin coat and was still very shiny after two weeks.</li>
      <li>Exact product used at the salon I went for my professional shellac</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t live without this!</li>
      <li>being done over the top of the shellac, regular polish tends to last longer as well, and you can konad too!</li>
      <li>This top coat is the finishing touch when using Shellac and a bottle will last a year doing your nails every ten days.  </li>
      <li>This really does the job to complete a shellac polish and it is done for two to three weeks with no problems.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply, although a little time consuming.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;ve also found that you can use a regular polish over the top if you&#x27;d like to switch things up before the shellac begins to break down.</li>
      <li>I was amazed at how much healthier they look than they did before starting the shellac usage.  </li>
      <li>and you wind up with a natural look with shine.</li>
      <li>I like to leave my nails natural</li>
      <li>I was doing my nails where I had natural sunlight</li>
      <li>and you have WOW looking nails</li>
      <li>Professional salon quality.</li>
      <li>This finish gives a tough finish that is almost as satisfying as acrylic nails (which I can&#x27;t wear because they eventually weaken my natural nail to the point of destruction).</li>
      <li>I can also use the top coat over regular polish and it will last at least a week..</li>
      <li>Finally I have a manicure done at home that looks professional.</li>
      <li>My natural nails were thin and easily chipped.  </li>
      <li>After purchasing the larger bottles of top coat and bast coat to keep the expense down for the CND Shellac products, I found that Bigger for this product is not necessarily better.  </li>
      <li>It bonds well for 10-14 days when I need to redo due to new nail growth.</li>

<li> I bought the top, base, color coat, and the curing light for less than $60.</li>
<li> /&gt;i abuse my nails pretty hard</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t last the whold 2 weeks.  It peels off begining in just a few days and you have to remove it and redo.</li>
    <li> when i use all the recommended steps (1 base coat, 2 colour coats, 1 top coat), my nails are beautiful-- deep, opaque colour and crazy SHINY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i abuse my nails pretty hard playing rock piano, so the 5-7 days of chip-free wear i get from cnd shellac is _outstanding_.</li>
    <li> The Creative CND Shellac UV top coat is everything that I had thought that it would be.  Works great with other CND Shellac products.  Nails like you have had them done at the salon.</li>
    <li> First time putting on Shellac on my nails. This top coat is good. I&#x27;ve had it on now  for a week and my nail polish is still on. I have no chips.</li>
    <li> Great product, this is the first time I ever used the UV Gel Nail System and absolutely love this product. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this top coat thinking it was a gel polish.  The box says it wears like gel polish.  Well, it doesn&#x27;t.  I don&#x27;t know how this differs from the gel polish used in salons, but at the cost, it&#x27;s definitely not worth it.</li>
    <li> At first i didnt know how to use the gel but after i figured it out how to use it very happy and it works just fine with reg polish and last very long</li>
    <li> I used this CND Shellac UV Top Coat after applying the CND Shellac UV Base Coat and CND Shellac UV color.  Follow the directions for curing times between layers with the UV light and you have WOW looking nails that last 14 or more days.  I recommend these products to those who want to create their own manicure.</li>
    <li> The best no chip top, base and polish. CND goes on easy and comes off easy. OPI, is alot harder to apply and remove.</li>
    <li> This product works great and I love the way my nails always look well manicured.  The UV light I purchased through Amazon as well along with the Base Coat.  I like to leave my nails natural so I chose to not use a color base.  Just skip that part of the Shellac nails and you wind up with a natural look with shine.</li>
    <li> i recently purchased all the supplies to do shellac at home, and am loving it. i maybe need a little practice being neater, but that&#x27;s all me. i&#x27;ve also found that you can use a regular polish over the top if you&#x27;d like to switch things up before the shellac begins to break down. being done over the top of the shellac, regular polish tends to last longer as well, and you can konad too! i did a special-design french tip over romantique tonight, and am pleased with the results (my first stamped tips!). bonus - you can &#x27;erase&#x27; with non-acetone polish if you screw up really bad!</li>
    <li> It saves me so much money!! And it&#x27;s in the comfort of my own home!! I recommend buying this and inviting all your girlfriends over and doing a spa type day :) fun! You can even charge $5 bucks a person and buy more!</li>
    <li> This is a great product and offers good coverage with great shine. I like this product on my acrylic nails and I am able to go longer between fills.</li>
    <li> This product works great if you know how to use it.  I&#x27;ve been using shellac since May and love it.  The only problem with some people is it&#x27;s a little drying, I recommend using solar oil everyday.  As for my own nails, I have not noticed any drying, so I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I like how easily the top coat goes on, completes the process and looks sleek. Wish there was a larger quantity for the same price.</li>
    <li> Love having my own nails this shellac keeps my thin nails from braking off and stays on a long time.</li>
    <li> Amazing is all I can say. This product puts the finishing touches on a professional-looking manicure that lasts for as long as three weeks.  My natural nails were thin and easily chipped.  This finish gives a tough finish that is almost as satisfying as acrylic nails (which I can&#x27;t wear because they eventually weaken my natural nail to the point of destruction).</li>
    <li> I was paying $30 every two weeks for a shellac manicure at a salon. I bought the top, base, color coat, and the curing light for less than $60. It&#x27;s easy to apply, although a little time consuming. I don&#x27;t enjoy the removal process, but the savings is worth it. Sooner or later I&#x27;ll learn to give myself the French that I like so well.</li>
    <li> This is so cool! I love how long it lasts and it&#x27;s really easy! It goes on like nail polish and dries under the light so quickly. All you have to do is follow the instructions to the letter. (Except for the trained professional part, the DIY nail painter is more than qualified!) I took it to work and did my friends nails there and she was really impressed too! Now we want more colors!</li>
    <li> This was my first try at using Shellac for my nails.  This top coat worked exactly as described, was easy to apply a thin coat and was still very shiny after two weeks.</li>
    <li> This is good and I use it every week, it makes my nails look  very good, I would use this agin</li>
    <li> i have the whole CND Shellac system so this top coat is a must.  was happy to know it works great</li>
    <li> Love this top coat!!! Its better than other top gel coat. I noticed that this top coat doesnt make my nail crack and chip easily!</li>
    <li> bought this along with cream puff and base coat and a 45 watt UV lamp. Finally I have a manicure done at home that looks professional. The shellac cream puff wrinkles up so i have to be careful to put in on thinly</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about CND!  Use the right alcohol  % and follow the directions, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the same one you get in a salon.  Great product! If you can do it yourself, you WILL save money!!</li>
    <li> I have used it before.  I like this size bottle compared to the larger one.</li>
    <li> it is not as shiny as i thought it would have been. i was kind of mad but it wasnt that bad,</li>
    <li> I really like the vinylux polish. It usually lasts 1-2weeks. Maybe small chips after 2 weeks. But regular polish  chipsman peels the next day.  I can also use the top coat over regular polish and it will last at least a week..depending on the brand I think. But I do have one big gripe with it! The top coat is goopy and does not go smoothly when it reaches 1/2 bottle. Disappointing that I have to throw it away. It would nice if it came in smaller bottles. Or  maybe work on the formula.  Btw the yellow bycyle color is nasrty and streaky!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a greate product.</li>
    <li> Strong, durable, and shiny top coat. Wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy again!</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this top coat. its so shiny and lasts a very long time before chipping. I will be ordering some more soon enough.</li>
    <li> I use this and have no problems. I am allergic to acrylics so at first I was very careful, but have not had any problems in the many months I have been using it. Easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t live without this!</li>
    <li> I love the Shellac system.  It is very drying though so make sure you use nail oil every day.  Also, make sure you keep this product away from the UV light.  I was doing my nails where I had natural sunlight so I could see better; however, I found out that isn&#x27;t wise!  My bottle of top coat became immediately thick and it was ruined :(</li>
    <li> This really does the job to complete a shellac polish and it is done for two to three weeks with no problems.</li>
    <li> I love shellac and it&#x27;s easy to do at home.  Plenty of videos on u Tube to get you going and give you great tips.  The top coat provides a durable, glossy finish.  Don&#x27;t forget to add some extra curing time under the UV light (two 2 min cycles) and clean off the sticky residue with 90% isopropyl alcohol for lots of shine.</li>
    <li> Professional salon quality. Amazing and very easy to use. Exact product used at the salon I went for my professional shellac</li>
    <li> I purchased the CND UV lamp and all the items necessary to do my at home gel manicures.  Love this product and I use it with the CND base coat.</li>
    <li> Mine was all dried up and goopy as soon as I got it. Ive used shellac before, and this is NOT how the top coat is supposed to be, its important that you apply the polish very thin which is impossible if its as think as rubber cement. disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried all brands of gel nail polish, and Shellac&#x27;s brand is the least destructive to the nail, lasts the longest, and is the easiest to remove.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a year.  can get &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; after about 6 months.  it becomes difficult to apply and then doesn&#x27;t hold up as strong as it use to.  6 months is a great time frame for a product to last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a regular coat is all you need.  not too thin or thick</li>
    <li> I do my own manicure and this product performs the best of the shellac brands I&#x27;ve tried.  It bonds well for 10-14 days when I need to redo due to new nail growth. The manicure even survives me working in the garden each morning without gloves. Just don&#x27;t pick at it, it removes layers of nail if you do!</li>
    <li> great value for the money.  My only downfall with all CND polishes is that I wish there was more in the bottle. :0)</li>
    <li> After purchasing the larger bottles of top coat and bast coat to keep the expense down for the CND Shellac products, I found that Bigger for this product is not necessarily better.  With the .25 oz. bottle, I can use the entire bottle and have the same consistency from beginning to end.  The top coat leaves the perfect shine and finish for an amazing manicure.</li>
    <li> Works great, but I prefer OPI. CND has great colors that I ise though.</li>
    <li> Delivery was quick. I love Shelac!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Shellac process for almost a year and my nails have never looked better.  Recently I had to have surgery and remove all nail polish.  I was skeptical but did as advised.  I was amazed at how much healthier they look than they did before starting the shellac usage.  This top coat is the finishing touch when using Shellac and a bottle will last a year doing your nails every ten days.  Great product!</li>
