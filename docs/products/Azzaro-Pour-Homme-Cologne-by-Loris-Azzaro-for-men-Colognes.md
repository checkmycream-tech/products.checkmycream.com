      <li>It is by far my favorite cologne period.</li>
      <li>This is by far my favorite cologne</li>
      <li>Thank you for having the right one.</li>
      <li>god bless and thank you very much.</li>
      <li>I love this perfum so I by the big one&lt;</li>
      <li>By the third time I was used to the Vetiver, and I fell in love with Azzaro for men.</li>
      <li>Most probably there are only traces of eau de toilette and the rest water.</li>
      <li>This is a personal favorite.</li>
      <li>This scent is my husbands second favorite.  </li>
      <li>Deep rugged and sexy</li>
      <li>This is my all time and only favorite perfume .</li>
      <li>This is the first time I place an order of this product with Amazon and</li>
      <li>That perfume , is one of the most strongest perfumes I&#x27;ve bought, I like stronger perfumes, with big duration on body, and that perfume show that characteristics !</li>
      <li>As for the content, it is far from original Azzaro:</li>
      <li>My husband love this very much it stay on a him a long time</li>
      <li>Great Cologne always enjoy it, I believe the sent is not the same as 30 years ago but is close enough and that&#x27;s the only reason for the 4 stars they may sold the company to a new owner or they have new chemist.</li>
      <li>Classic scent!</li>
      <li>The bottle is huge and will last a year given my usage.</li>
      <li>will absolutely recommend it.</li>
      <li>my friend really like it</li>
      <li>fast delivery.</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>very well counterfeited bottle and box.</li>
      <li>My husband has been using Azzaro Eau de Toilette for over 35 years and we both know this is not the real thing.</li>
      <li>About the fixing element I did a research and found that fixer elements has changed during this period and the cause of so many bad reviews may lye there, the fixing element may not be as good as was used to be.</li>
      <li>Classic scent.</li>
      <li>This is one of my two current favorite scents for daily wear.</li>
      <li>This is an all timer classic.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended seller.</li>
      <li>Its not too heavy, and it exudes a masculine and sophisticated scent.</li>
      <li>With Montana red being the first.</li>
      <li>We have been looking for the right Azzaro for a long time.</li>
      <li>It lasts very long, which is very positive if you like the scent, so 2 stars.</li>
      <li>This time around, the smell is different, less appealing.  </li>
      <li>Complete value for money.</li>
      <li>Azzaro just never gets old.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny spent.</li>
      <li>Personally, I didn&#x27;t find it THAT objectionable, but it did seem a little discordant (or more specifically a little bit earthy) to me the first two times I wore it.</li>
      <li>This colgne came out in the late 70&#x27;s early 80&#x27;s originally.  </li>
      <li>This is as near as I&#x27;ve found to a universal cologne for myself.</li>
      <li>I purchased this after tried it in a department store, then found it here in Amazon at a good discount but the smell is not even close as the one I tested in the store, it&#x27;s away too weak , just goes away in a few minutes.</li>
      <li>I love fresh fragrances like Cool Water and this one is terrible for me.    </li>
      <li>I was not too smart to realize that half the price is dubious.</li>

    <li> Complete value for money. The bottle is huge and will last a year given my usage. Worth every penny spent.</li>
    <li> This is my all time and only favorite perfume . I love the smell, not too strong and it last long too. I am totally happy with my purchased.</li>
    <li> Excellent product was what I was expecting good quality</li>
    <li> My husband love this very much it stay on a him a long time</li>
    <li> Azzaro just never gets old. Great, great scent for a man!</li>
    <li> I liked and recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my sister&#x27;s husband and  he really liked the scent</li>
    <li> I remember this fragrance from almost thirty years ago. Long before Amazon or the Internet as we know it today. I love the warm, spicy, cinnamon aromas that arise from eau de toilette. It&#x27;s perfect for autumn and for evening.</li>
    <li> very well counterfeited bottle and box. As for the content, it is far from original Azzaro: the smell is different and lasts for couple of minutes only. Most probably there are only traces of eau de toilette and the rest water. I was not too smart to realize that half the price is dubious. Stay away!</li>
    <li> This scent is my husbands second favorite.  With Montana red being the first. Huge bottle great deal smells sexy and amazing and if you spray this and then Spray montana watch out! It smells like heaven. Meant for a manly man not a light scent. Deep rugged and sexy</li>
    <li> I just hate the scent. It&#x27;s probably something personal, but I think people should know. I love fresh fragrances like Cool Water and this one is terrible for me.    It lasts very long, which is very positive if you like the scent, so 2 stars.</li>
    <li> Great Cologne always enjoy it, I believe the sent is not the same as 30 years ago but is close enough and that&#x27;s the only reason for the 4 stars they may sold the company to a new owner or they have new chemist.</li>
    <li> Good quality. Product as expected.</li>
    <li> I ran out and needed my cologne quick. None of the retail stores carry it as it has been on the market for a few years. I am glad I can still get my Azzaro Fix.  thanks</li>
    <li> its a completely fake product. (not original).</li>
    <li> great product. fast delivery. very good packaging.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> False Azzaro, very different from the original product. Is not lasting and the smell is not pleasant. Cheap and bad.</li>
    <li> Still rocks after all these years.</li>
    <li> Classic scent! nice pricing for 200 ml</li>
    <li> Disappointed --- Extremely watered down. My husband has been using Azzaro Eau de Toilette for over 35 years and we both know this is not the real thing.</li>
    <li> This colgne came out in the late 70&#x27;s early 80&#x27;s originally.  I bought it once way back in the mid 90&#x27;s and I thought it smelled nice. It had a different &amp; unique scent which I liked.  I&#x27;d get compliments EVERYDAY I wore it and how nice it smelled on me. And above all, the scent stayed with me all day long. It is by far my favorite cologne period.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is amazing and the 6.8 (200ml) bottle is a great cost x benefit relation. For those who like this fragrance, I recommend to buy this one.</li>
    <li> I have always loved this perfume.  It arrived a day or two late, but I am glad I ordered it; a wonderful product, at a very good price.</li>
    <li> Excellent, Good  Price and size, couldn&#x27;t ask for better.</li>
    <li> It arrive in good conditions and smells great, best perfume for men ever. I love it. Buy it for every man</li>
    <li> This is a personal favorite. Its not too heavy, and it exudes a masculine and sophisticated scent. Its not overpowering, and can be worn daily.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years and been extremely happy with its smell and duration of its scent.  This time around, the smell is different, less appealing.  Did the manufacturer of this product change the formula?</li>
    <li> This is my stuff, I&#x27;ve been using this for many years.  It&#x27;s subtle, and a little old-school.</li>
    <li> This is the best deal I have ever found for this cologne for price and size.  Will definitely order again</li>
    <li> This very large size bottle of my favorite fragrance was promptly delivered by Amazon, and at a price that was too good to be true, but it was!  I am very happy with my purchase (as are those around me who love this scent).  Highly recommended seller.</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume, I am really happy with all the purchases that I did in Amazon</li>
    <li> I love it and got willing i will continue to purchase thru you guys from years to come god bless and thank you very much. sincerely kenny mercado.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been curious about the falsehood or genuinity of this perfume as sold in Amazon.com. I know Azzaro for more than 30 years, but that was a time when II couldn&#x27;t afford buying it, so I have no memory of the scent. Lately I had the opportunity to buy it and can affirm that the scent lasts time enough even when used parsimoniously. About the fixing element I did a research and found that fixer elements has changed during this period and the cause of so many bad reviews may lye there, the fixing element may not be as good as was used to be.</li>
    <li> I love this product and been using since 1984. I was going to gift it to a friend, but I couldn&#x27;t because box didn&#x27;t have wrap and bottle plastic cover broken. I kept it for my self and bought another one at Macy&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> This is one of my two current favorite scents for daily wear. The other is Cerruti 1881. [Update, this is now part of a 3 product rotation with Cerruti 1881 and Guerlain&#x27;s Vetiver] Today the more modern Azzaro Chrome is more popular, but even though this scent has been around longer than I have, its the version I prefer. Sellers tend to call this &amp;#34;A spicy lavender amber fragrance&amp;#34;, and Amazon says it contains &amp;#34;Wood, Musk, Basil. and Sandalwood&amp;#34;, but neither of these matches Azzaro&#x27;s description. According to them, the notes are &amp;#34;Lemon, Star Anise, Basil, Vetiver, and Oakmoss&amp;#34;. IMO the Vetiver is the key to this fragrance and whether or not you will like it. I&#x27;ve seen complaints about a &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;foul&amp;#34;, or &amp;#34;musky&amp;#34; note and that&#x27;s the Vetiver, which is obvious as soon as you spray. Personally, I didn&#x27;t find it THAT objectionable, but it did seem a little discordant (or more specifically a little bit earthy) to me the first two times I wore it. By the third time I was used to the Vetiver, and I fell in love with Azzaro for men. It&#x27;s got a wonderful drydown, the perfect combination of strength, projection, longevity, and subtlety. This is always noticeable, and lasts all day, yet in my experience it will not overwhelm the people around you. 3-4 sprays will typically last me well over 12 hours. Who is this for? Anyone who doesn&#x27;t mind the Vetiver punch up front and who wants a classic, classy, super high quality, perfectly executed fougere style cologne. This amounts to a slam-dunk for me personally. It&#x27;s not mysterious, to me it says &amp;#34;barbershop&amp;#34; &amp;#34;gentleman&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;I&#x27;m well groomed yet I don&#x27;t smell anything like a chick&amp;#34; all at once. This is as near as I&#x27;ve found to a universal cologne for myself.</li>
    <li> I have used this cologne off and on since 1981. It will always be my favorite. This cologne was once rated Playboy&#x27;s number one male sexiest cologne. Just think, I knew it before they did.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update....I have now had this bottle 2 years. It is 2/3rds gone and it still smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite for years and years.  I have had a lot of compliments on this cologne.  It will continue to be my favorite!  A great price too.</li>
    <li> bought for my husband because IAN SOMERHALDER. nuff said.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after tried it in a department store, then found it here in Amazon at a good discount but the smell is not even close as the one I tested in the store, it&#x27;s away too weak , just goes away in a few minutes. Besides, it has a very strong rubbing alcohol smell and not smell like the original. At first I thought was original, nice bottle and box; but the smell said the opposite.&lt;br /&gt;If you only need it for few minutes then buy it, otherwise get it from another seller!!!</li>
    <li> great price!  it was a gift....my friend really like it</li>
    <li> I am so glad I am able to purchase this on-line at an affordable price.  It has become my only fragrance.</li>
    <li> Ols good frien. Smells great</li>
    <li> Very good cologne. It smell very nice, and every girl I have contact with loved the smell. will absolutely recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite cologne and I have been using it for years. This is the first time I place an order of this product with Amazon and unfortunately this time I was not so lucky with it.  After almost two weeks of having gotten the cologne it turned out that the vaporizer does not let the fragance to pour out and I cannot use it.  I will have to return it and get another one of the same and I hope this time will arrive in good shape.&lt;br /&gt;An Azzaro fan!</li>
    <li> This product was hard to find. Well priced.</li>
    <li> This perfum is the smell I like since I been teenayer. I love this perfum so I by the big one&lt;br /&gt;I recomended it to my friends and to my father.......</li>
    <li> This is an all timer classic. Will never lose the magic its scent produces. Add a nice suit and a glass of whisky, and it&#x27;s owner will sure be ready to impress anywhere.</li>
    <li> We have been looking for the right Azzaro for a long time. I think somebody has been switching the fragrances out. The smells have changed and we have a few bottles that smell badly. I love the way it smells finally we have it back. Thank you for having the right one.</li>
    <li> Great price and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I liked the product, very good. My order arrived on schedule.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased and happy with my purchase&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to my friends</li>
    <li> That perfume , is one of the most strongest perfumes I&#x27;ve bought, I like stronger perfumes, with big duration on body, and that perfume show that characteristics !</li>
    <li> Classic scent. The fragrance appeals to everyone. Execelente fixing and cost-effective.</li>
