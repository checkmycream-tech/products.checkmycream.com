      <li>The cleaning system does a great job.  </li>
      <li>But its a good product.</li>
      <li>This shaver, and the unique nature of the trimmer that also works in conjunction with the foils, makes it the perfect shaver for me.  </li>
      <li>Good product for many years.</li>
      <li>I use some salon clipper spray to clean my shaver, and it works great, so while I am keeping the cleaning system around (in the box, in storage), the simplicity of clipper spray works better for me.  </li>

      <li>Will return it for sure.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product over a year and like that it does most of the cleaning for me.</li>
      <li>My dad texts me daily about how great it is!</li>
      <li>I am sure this is why the foils wear so rapidly.</li>
      <li>I love the shaver</li>
      <li>love it.</li>

      <li>It cleans well and is easy to use.</li>
      <li>Bulky, but works fine.</li>

      <li>At this rate, the cost of ownership is probably the highest available.  </li>
      <li>This was a great purchase especially for the money.</li>
      <li>It is very noisy, but OK.</li>
      <li>It is solid, holds a good charge, and shaves well.  </li>
      <li>I recently was in the market for a New Electric Razor, I have used Rotary razors since I have been shaving but have heard nothing but good things about Remington&#x27;s Foil Shavers.</li>
      <li>But overall I was OK with it.</li>
      <li>I first got a Panasonic ES8077S.</li>
      <li>Good shaver but the cleaning system is a waste.</li>
      <li>It holds a charge very well.</li>
      <li>I also shave against the grain for a very close shave.</li>
      <li>When this happens, it can really rip your face.</li>
      <li>Cuts real close.</li>
      <li>and didn&#x27;t think this would work, but my barber used it on the back of my neck and it felt so smooth.  </li>
      <li>The cleaning system is really why I wanted this and while it does clean the razor (and having that clean of a razor everyday is really something that you shouldn&#x27;t live without)</li>
      <li>I purchased this shaver for my dad for his birthday, he has 2 older Remington shavers but both are on the verge of dying.</li>
      <li>Customer Service at Remington says the cutters and foils are not covered under the warranty and this wear is normal.</li>
      <li>My boyfriend got this shaver years ago and he needed a new one I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere until I looked on amazon</li>
      <li>But my face doesn&#x27;t seem to tolerate a very close shave, and my facial hair doesn&#x27;t grow as fast as some, so I just want to have a shaver that helps me to stay looking neat, without tearing up my skin.  </li>
      <li>My first Remmington Purchase will be my last    </li>
      <li>This is my first Remington product and probably my last.</li>
      <li>so you have to buy new ones frequently.</li>
      <li>I really like the way this shaver works for me, so I attempted to buy a new one of the same type.  </li>
      <li>then it did with my 5 year old Norelco Rotary</li>
      <li>It is loud, but that doesnt concern me.</li>
      <li>I do not use the charging station, I plug the cord directly into the shaver.</li>
      <li>And it is so loud I can&#x27;t shave until everyone in the house is awake or the Razor wakes them all up.    </li>
      <li>I switched to a Remington MS680CS for the past year and it was fine.</li>
      <li>I previously owned the MS2-290 shaver, and this MS680 and the MS2-390 seem like they&#x27;re pretty much the newer version of the same shaver, so I bought it.  </li>
      <li>It worked well, but pinched me too much and gave me cuts (I now know this was because I was using it wet).</li>
      <li>This thing us super loud and the pop-up shaver hardly works.</li>
      <li>I live in a tiny house, with a tiny bathroom.  </li>
      <li>In short, Stay away from this Razor, Complete and Utter Junk.</li>
      <li>I have shaved with this, the noisiest razor possible, daily and already the foils have developed holes.  </li>
      <li>All of the other 1-star reviews are completely accurate on this, learn a lesson from us and don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
      <li>Mix lotion with a little water so not to use too much lotion.</li>
      <li>The trimmer edge is not as sharp as it shud be and that the reason i needed a new shaver, and the trimmer is slanted when fully up..</li>
      <li>One f the few trimmers left that has the large trimming attachment.</li>

    <li> I purchased this shaver for my dad for his birthday, he has 2 older Remington shavers but both are on the verge of dying. This gift was so perfect. My dad texts me daily about how great it is!</li>
    <li> I love the shaver but I&#x27;m disappointed in the purchase because I didn&#x27;t receive the cleaning solution. That was the purpose of the purchase. Can the company ship the cleaning solution or should I return the order?</li>
    <li> The trimmer edge is not as sharp as it shud be and that the reason i needed a new shaver, and the trimmer is slanted when fully up..</li>
    <li> My first elect. razor in 40 years, but my memory tells me that this is the best I&#x27;ve had.  The cleaning system does a great job.  I brushed it off before I put it in the solution and it spends a few hours cleaning after you start it, but comes out looking brand new.</li>
    <li> This is my first Remington product and probably my last. This thing us super loud and the pop-up shaver hardly works. All of the other 1-star reviews are completely accurate on this, learn a lesson from us and don&#x27;t waste your money. Whatever team at Remington created this, I hope they are fired for created the most inferior electric shaver ever made.</li>
    <li> The MS680 is very similar to the MS280/290 I replaced. At $70 I gave it a shot and I am very happy I did. I couldn&#x27;t justify paying $200 something for the MS280 that I used for years. This unit came with instructions for 280/290/680. I do not use the charging station, I plug the cord directly into the shaver. I can shave 5 to 6 times on a single charge.</li>
    <li> I recently was in the market for a New Electric Razor, I have used Rotary razors since I have been shaving but have heard nothing but good things about Remington&#x27;s Foil Shavers. I purchased a Remington Titanium, MS 680 in about mid July and it is without a doubt the worse razor i have ever purchased.  1. It takes twice as long to shave then it did with my 5 year old Norelco Rotary and then I still don&#x27;t get a close shave.  2. the trimmer is awkward and dull.  3. And it is so loud I can&#x27;t shave until everyone in the house is awake or the Razor wakes them all up.    I purchased this Shaver in a retail department store that refuses to take it back because it has been used and is not defective, and I am 100% unsatisfied with the purchase.  My first Remmington Purchase will be my last    I have contacted Remington about this Razor and am still awaiting a reply.    In short, Stay away from this Razor, Complete and Utter Junk.</li>
    <li> If you have used a dual foil Remington before then you know how the razor works. It is solid, holds a good charge, and shaves well.  The cleaning system is really why I wanted this and while it does clean the razor (and having that clean of a razor everyday is really something that you shouldn&#x27;t live without) I have a problem with the system. The cleaning solution is open to the air. By that I mean it just sits in a cup inside of the unit. That leads to alot of evaporation. If the fluid was in a contained cartridge maybe it would last a bit longer. That said, this is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned and I&#x27;ll never own another that doesn&#x27;t have a cleaning system.</li>
    <li> I purchase this MS 680 on May 24, 2010.  Today is Dec 3, 2010. I have a minimal beard and soft whiskers.  I have shaved with this, the noisiest razor possible, daily and already the foils have developed holes.  When this happens, it can really rip your face. Customer Service at Remington says the cutters and foils are not covered under the warranty and this wear is normal. They recommend replacement cutters and foils every 6 months. At this rate, the cost of ownership is probably the highest available.  It does give a close shave, too close in my opinion as I got some razor burn from the beginning of use.  I am sure this is why the foils wear so rapidly. PLANNED obsolescence so you have to buy new ones frequently. I suggest you price the replacement foils to consider the 2 times per year your added cost. I have used electric razors for over 40 years and this one is the noisiest I have heard. It can be heard anywhere in the house with the bathroom door closed. This was the worst experience I have had with any electric razor. I do not recommend your buying this poorly designed product.  BAH! HUMBUG!</li>
    <li> Please don&#x27;t buy this piece of junk.      First of all the pop up trimmer does a very bad job,   and the blades can&#x27;t handle the missed hairs.    Also the cleaning solution is impossible to find.  No stores   carry it, and the only place to get the solution from   is Remington itself.   Big bucks to 1.  buy the solution   and 2.   to get it shipped to you.    Run, don&#x27;t walk away from this junk.       This is easily the worst shaver i&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
    <li> This was a great purchase especially for the money. It cleans well and is easy to use. Use circular motions, great instructions. Mix lotion with a little water so not to use too much lotion. Cuts real close.</li>
    <li> I previously owned the MS2-290 shaver, and this MS680 and the MS2-390 seem like they&#x27;re pretty much the newer version of the same shaver, so I bought it.  The reason I had to replace my shaver was that after about 5 years, the rubber switch had torn a hole in it, and some water eventually got inside the shaver and rusted it out and it failed.  I really like the way this shaver works for me, so I attempted to buy a new one of the same type.  The shave is admittedly not as close as other shavers that I&#x27;ve tried.  But my face doesn&#x27;t seem to tolerate a very close shave, and my facial hair doesn&#x27;t grow as fast as some, so I just want to have a shaver that helps me to stay looking neat, without tearing up my skin.  This shaver, and the unique nature of the trimmer that also works in conjunction with the foils, makes it the perfect shaver for me.  I hope they keep making these for a long time.  It&#x27;s hard to keep up.  You usually buy a shaver, and hope to get a few extra blades and foils so that when they discontinue it, you can stay in business for a while.  Fortunately, Remington seems to have kept these shavers around a while, good news for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning system seems HUGE and clunky, and sadly doesn&#x27;t come with the solution.  Personally I bought this model because it was around $30 cheaper than the MS2-390 which didn&#x27;t come with the cleaning system.  I live in a tiny house, with a tiny bathroom.  Even if I had a huge bathroom, I kinda doubt if I would use this volcano-huge cleaning \\&quot;bucket\\&quot; on my countertop.  I need stuff that&#x27;s small and simple.  I use some salon clipper spray to clean my shaver, and it works great, so while I am keeping the cleaning system around (in the box, in storage), the simplicity of clipper spray works better for me.  I understand the instructions say not to use any harsh cleaners as it might remove the coating from the blades.  So don&#x27;t take my advice if you fear screwing up your blades.  It just seems to work great for me.</li>
    <li> Just for context, I am a picky shaver (one who shaves) with sensitive skin and a round, slightly chubby face. I also shave against the grain for a very close shave. I used to shave with a razor, but got tired of cutting myself. :-)  I first got a Panasonic ES8077S. It worked well, but pinched me too much and gave me cuts (I now know this was because I was using it wet). Shave was about 90% as close as using a razor in the shower.  I switched to a Remington MS680CS for the past year and it was fine. It holds a charge very well. It is very noisy, but OK. Shave (dry) was about 70% as close as using a razor. It did have trouble with longer hairs on my neck (where I don&#x27;t shave as often). But overall I was OK with it. But, in the end, I got tired of the level of stubble I had at night.  I&#x27;ve gone back to Panasonic.</li>
    <li> Bulky, but works fine. It is loud, but that doesnt concern me. One f the few trimmers left that has the large trimming attachment. Havent used the cleaning section though.</li>
    <li> Just bought it from Menards this week (on sale) for $30. But not worth the money!  The noise is so loud that makes me very uncomfortable. Will return it for sure. JUNK!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product over a year and like that it does most of the cleaning for me. However, it stays on for hours when a weekly cleaning is performed.</li>
    <li> A very good product that gives a close shave and the cleaning system helps to maintain that close cut.</li>
    <li> This Remington is now not being made anymore. My husband has used this model for years. Actually his Doctor recommended it because of the allergies his has from shaving.  this worked for that. He will have difficulty finding a replacement.. Good product for many years.</li>
    <li> The shaver is what I wanted. The weird cleaning apparatus is just a piece of trash that takes up counter space.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband, he loves the product however the blade broke after 2 usage. But its a good product.</li>
    <li> and didn&#x27;t think this would work, but my barber used it on the back of my neck and it felt so smooth.  i asked him for the product info and i bought this.  it is great.  i have to shave period but now no worries.  the other reviews about it being loud.  dont&#x27; pay any attention.  it&#x27;s an electric shaver...hello.  love it.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend got this shaver years ago and he needed a new one I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere until I looked on amazon he loves it!!</li>
    <li> Good shaver but the cleaning system is a waste.</li>
    <li> The shaver part works great but the trimmer is HORRIBLE/DULL</li>
</ol>
