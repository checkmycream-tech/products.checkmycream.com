      <li>2 separate 1/2 pumps not only washes my faces, but removes most traces of makeup too which is a nice</li>
      <li>Feels nice and is gentle on the skin love that it has natural ingrediants.</li>

      <li>Always looking for a product that can clean my face and not leave it blotchy, not as much for an acne situation</li>
      <li>This is a nice sized bottle of product many products come in 2oz bottles that really make it hard to get a longer term evaluation.  </li>

      <li>As I mentioned in my previous review, I have very acne-prone skin and have tried many different products over the years.</li>
      <li>I will say though, it did leave my skin feeling hydrated and not dried out.</li>
      <li>I decided to try this product because it was for sensitive skin with no harsh chemicals.</li>
      <li>24 years old</li>
      <li>I have a 21 year old daughter that was having some skin</li>
      <li>10 days was not enough time to really tell a difference in her acne.</li>
      <li>and I am VERY prone to acne yet (dry skin, cystic acne).</li>
      <li>I have also had products that seem to irritate my skin even though they get rid of my major problem areas.</li>
      <li>first time I used this I purposely waited a few minutes to put moisturizer on to see if this stuff harshly dried up my face and I am pleased to say it did not overly dry my skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I will get a blemish here and there around my monthly cycle, but other than that, my skin has been clear and alive!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Got this thru a review program so I didn&#x27;t pay full price.  Doesn&#x27;t foam up, but seems to do the job without drying out my skin.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this product because it was for sensitive skin with no harsh chemicals. I have a 21 year old daughter that was having some skin issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has tried several different products and the ones that seem to work leave her skin burning and irritated. She has used this product for a couple of weeks now. As she was applying her make up before work recently she asked me if I had done a review on this product yet. I said no I was waiting for her to tell me what she thought of it. She said,&amp;#34; look at my skin mom&amp;#34;, and smiled. She literally loves the face Acne/Sensitive Skin Face Wash (Cleanser) and was definitely pleased with the results. She still has some acne but the difference was amazing. I could definitely see a difference in her skin.  It looks much clearer and healthier.  It did not burn her skin or leave her irritated at all.  She definitely will continue using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. The product leaves your skin feeling clean and the smell is nice and the results are amazing. It is gentle and non-irritating. Definitely a product with the results any one with irritated skin would love.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product. I noticed a difference in my skin right away. You can tell it&#x27;s pure and natural and it works!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my daughter, and she has just recently started using it. Results are showing good already.</li>
    <li> Feels nice and is gentle on the skin love that it has natural ingrediants. I used this along side of my clarisonic to get the product into my skin and really liked the combo. I didnt like the smell  it was a synthetic smell which is weird would love it to smell more of the lavander or tea tree that is already in it.</li>
    <li> I received the order to do a review. My daughter has moderate acne I was hoping it worked. After about 10 days she says she like the way it makes her skin feel but hasn&#x27;t helped the acne yet. The smell is not bad, but not wonderful. She is going to keep using it to see if her acne improves. 10 days was not enough time to really tell a difference in her acne.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great!  The redness around my worst acne went away right after using it, and my skin was noticably clearer in only 2 days. My acne virtually cleared by the end of the week. Some of my more stubborn acne needed a stronger wash but all in all it was a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still needed to use a moisturizer after using this, though I&#x27;m not sure if it was the product or my tap water that was leaving my skin feeling so dry.</li>
    <li> I did not order this product.</li>
    <li> Is a good product! However it leaves my skin a bit to dry.</li>
    <li> Gentle and effective...I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I have pretty sensitive skin and really don&#x27;t like products with lots of fragrance, so this Acne / Sensitive Skin Face Wash Cleanser, 72% Organic was available in exchange for my review so here we are!  This is a nice sized bottle of product many products come in 2oz bottles that really make it hard to get a longer term evaluation.  I will always update my review if long term results are interesting...  Always looking for a product that can clean my face and not leave it blotchy, not as much for an acne situation (thankfully- had enough of that as a child...)  followed the simple instructions and used it on my face, not much fragrance and so far no reaction just clean soft skin.  I really like this product...&lt;br /&gt;Interesting note: Sugar based product, I have not seen this before but the product works great and the price is ok for a 4oz bottle in my opinion this bottle will last 40-60 days for me so the cost is under .50 a day.  Try it you will like it....</li>
    <li> As someone who had troubled skin all my life I&#x27;m always looking for that wash or miracle worker product. If only I could pick and choose pieces from each.&lt;br /&gt;I love that this cleanser is sulfate and paraben free, those are hard to come by these days. My personal issues with with face wash however were the fact that it didn&#x27;t lather much and that it was difficult to remove my eye makeup with it. In fact, it kinda burned my eyes a bit. I will say though, it did leave my skin feeling hydrated and not dried out. Try it for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;Note: I received this product for a minimum fee in order to give my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> My skin feels really clean and clear when I wash with this.  I have used several of these products and they are wonderful.  Super happy with the results.  Good quality, great packaging and nice price.  The whole deal!</li>
    <li> What I found I like about this face wash is that a little goes a long way. 2 separate 1/2 pumps not only washes my faces, but removes most traces of makeup too which is a nice bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used this I purposely waited a few minutes to put moisturizer on to see if this stuff harshly dried up my face and I am pleased to say it did not overly dry my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can see myself using this product going forward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect Body Harmony provided this sample for testing and review with no guarantee of a favorable review.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for a few weeks now and have noticed an improvement in my skin tone and clarity. Glad to have stumbled on this product.</li>
    <li> I use this product in concert with the Teddy&#x27;s Rose Water Facial Toner.  Both work so well, smell good, and make my skin look great.  This product even removes stubborn eye makeup.  I am a believer and am now loyal to this facial cleanser.</li>
    <li> Love this face wash - its so clean feeling, love the soft scent ...I keep in my shower to wash my face daily. Love it!</li>
    <li> There are lots of organic ingredients in this list, which was great but there were a few that weren&#x27;t as well, which I was a little disappointed with. It smells great and my face has been reacting well to it so far, which is great and overall I&#x27;m really happy with this product :)</li>
    <li> Great product, I have recommended this to everyone I know.itvhas cleared up all my acne and my skin is glowing now. I love it thank you so much for allowing me to review it</li>
    <li> 24 years old and I am VERY prone to acne yet (dry skin, cystic acne). I&#x27;ve tried a million regiments and I&#x27;ve found that the ones that work best are the ones that seem the most simple. What I like about this face wash is that it doesn&#x27;t dry out my face as much as some washes in the past have. I have also had products that seem to irritate my skin even though they get rid of my major problem areas. I&#x27;ve used this product in conjunction with their organic facial toner and it&#x27;s kept my skin feeling clean and healthy. As I suffer from acne, I believe it is safe to say that this product is great for acne-prone, sensitive skin. I received this product in exchange for my honest review.   ***An update to my review. I have now been using this product for 4 months and I have seen a HUGE difference in my skin. I rarely have any redness on my face anymore and I will get a blemish here and there around my monthly cycle, but other than that, my skin has been clear and alive! My mother commented the other day on how great my skin has been looking and I was so happy! I don&#x27;t know if others have experienced the same results from this product, but I am very pleased and will continue using this product from now on. As I mentioned in my previous review, I have very acne-prone skin and have tried many different products over the years. I&#x27;m so happy with the results of this product and the difference it&#x27;s made in my skin. Thank you Perfect Body Harmony! :)</li>
    <li> I have a really sensitive skin and this product is great! It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. I was given this product so I can try it and then give a review about how I honestly feel. I&#x27;m going to repurchase this once my current bottle is gone. If you have sensitive skin and you&#x27;re looking for a new cleanser, get this one!</li>
