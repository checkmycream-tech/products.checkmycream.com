<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I absolutely LOVE White Diamonds and have used it for years. I ordered it for myself for Christmas, but instead received something called Sparkling White Diamonds. This is NOT the same scent. The bottle looks the same except that it is a pale blue.The receipt said White Diamonds but the product inside the box wasn&#x27;t what I ordered.</li>
    <li> Very happy w/all purchases!!</li>
    <li> I will always use this product. It is the scent for me.</li>
    <li> I did not receive the fragrance I ordered. I ordered White Diamonds. Instead of  receiving what I&#x27;d ordered, I received Sparkling White Diamonds. I was upset at receiving something I did not order. I read someone&#x27;s review who had a similar experience and thought \\&quot;it won&#x27;t happen to me\\&quot;. But it did.  The fragrance is ok and I kept it because I didn&#x27;t want to be bothered with the return process. In the future, because of this experience, I may look into another fragrance supplier.</li>
    <li> Sparkling White Diamonds is a soft powdery fragrance. My hubby accidently bought this for me for Christmas two years ago; I was a little disappointed that it wasn&#x27;t \\&quot;White Diamonds,\\&quot; until I sprayed it the first time...It is the best of both worlds, superior light White Diamonds fragrance, plus the softness of light powdery back scent...Love this fragrance!</li>
    <li> this perfume smells even nicer than i taught</li>
    <li> My wife has used both White Diamonds and Sparkling White Diamonds and I love both. The Sparkling scent is a little different from the original and makes for a nice complement if you are using both. I find that the Sparkling version has a fresher scent and is somewhat lighter in fragrance. I think using White Diamonds in the morning and then a touch of Sparkling as the evening approaches is a great way to use the scents together and gives a nice twist to what could become boring with just one scent all the time.</li>
    <li> Perfect scent --- light and delicious!  Perfect for everyday use...everyone will comment on it...take my word!!  A very nice change.</li>
    <li> I had not tried the lighter White Diamonds Sparkling before. It is perfect for daytime. Just a tad lighter than the original which is more formal. Both have man-pleasing scents. I am sensitive to to flowery a scent myself, and I really find this works great. Not at all overpowering.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume!  I have it for years.  Well worth the money.  Would buy this product again from this person.</li>
    <li> Would definitely recommend this product.  Just like what you get in the store; but for less money. One of my favorite fragrances.</li>
    <li> It did meet my expectations it&#x27;s very good</li>
    <li> Light fragrance for Spring and Summer</li>
    <li> Enjoyed the new fragrance so much. Reminded me of Avon&#x27;s Topaz which I wore for years but could no longer find it in stock anywhere.</li>
    <li> Love the way this smells on me.</li>
    <li> I love White Diamonds &amp; this is one of my Favorite out of all them!  I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves the smell of White Diamonds!</li>
    <li> Love the smell -always get compliments on it - so much easier to order from Amazon instead of going to the mall just for this one purchase</li>
    <li> Very nice light fragrance...does not take very much at all but lasts all day. Love it</li>
    <li> I love White Dimonds, and thought this would be good too----it&#x27;s awful, don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> I find the scent of Sparkling White Diamonds lighter than the regular White Diamonds.&lt;br /&gt;I get A LOT of compliments when I wear it.</li>
    <li> Too strong; it would have been a great fragrance had it been bit mild.</li>
    <li> Twice as much for the same price.&lt;br /&gt;Gave me brownie points with my mother in law.&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase again.  Great Gift</li>
    <li> It is my wife&#x27;s favorite and the only place she can by it, is online. She is not an internet type of person either. I wish it was available in local stores. Thank you for stocking it. I will be future purchases of this product.</li>

    <li> My wife wanted to try this, so I bought it for her. She says it&#x27;s &amp;#34;just not her&amp;#34; and doesn&#x27;t like it. I gave it a neutral rating just to be fair.</li>
    <li> Not as great as others, but nice.</li>
