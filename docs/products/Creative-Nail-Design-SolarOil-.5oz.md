      <li>really good thid product for dry the shellac...</li>
      <li>But finally my hubby gifted me this product &amp; let me tell you, ITS LIKE BUTTER!</li>
      <li>My cuticles look completely different (and healthy!).  </li>
      <li>Easily absorbed.  </li>
      <li>This solar oil absorbs into my nails quickly and very well.  </li>
      <li>Came very fast .</li>
      <li>I find there&#x27;s no point in applying the oil when the skin is bone dry but best after hands have been washed and the skin is slightly damp.</li>
      <li>Long story short, this stuff works great if you have that issue as well.</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>no artificial nails and this oil keeps the cuticles from becoming too dry.  </li>
      <li>&amp; so I started using olive oil with pure garlic in it.  </li>
      <li>so I haven&#x27;t noticed much improvement yet.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend!</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>haha.</li>
      <li>Otherwise it&#x27;s like brushing oil onto a mirror where it won&#x27;t really absorb and gets rubbed away.</li>
      <li>The photo of this item is very misleading.</li>
      <li>It really keeps the skin moist.  </li>
      <li>Been using for two months and my nails grew back completely and better than ive felt them in years</li>
      <li>Keep it near my bed, and put it on right before I go to sleep at night.</li>
      <li>Smell is great but other cuticle oils can do the same job for a lesser price.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend</li>
      <li>The manicurist in the video highly recommended this product.  </li>
      <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>There is always some product you can&#x27;t get out of the bottom of a bottle, so it feels like much more will be wasted with four bottles than one.</li>
      <li>They seemed to make the nails harder but also more brittle and sometimes yellow.  </li>
      <li>I have gotten my nails done for ten years plus and my natural nails were so brittle they ripped right off.</li>
      <li>I think it is great for natural or artificial nails.</li>
      <li>With regular use it really makes a difference.</li>
      <li>I came across this oil after seeing a \\&quot;natural nail care\\&quot; video on YouTube.  </li>
      <li>After removing my acrylic nails which I&#x27;ve had for well over 20 years, I found myself searching for natural nail care products.  </li>
      <li>Then I was reading about nail problems and learned that dryness is a frequent problem.  </li>
      <li>the cuticles remain soft, they don&#x27;t overgrow the nails and never split or crack.  </li>
      <li>The oil itself is a fairly mundane combination of Vitamin E and oil, mostly sweet almond oil by the smell of it.  </li>
      <li>(so you don&#x27;t have to worry about being oily for too long), and it smells absolutely fantastic!.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Massaging just a small drop on each nail/cuticle area nightly keeps them looking smooth and neat.</li>
      <li>After one week of this I could see a major change.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My nails have vertical ridges and a couple have a really deep ridge that tends to split, caused probably by a combination of age and injury and swimming in chlorinated pools.. I had tried several brands of nail hardeners.  They seemed to make the nails harder but also more brittle and sometimes yellow.  Then I was reading about nail problems and learned that dryness is a frequent problem.  If your nails are already dehydrated, nail hardeners only make the problem worse (even though they appear to protect the nails in the short term.)  That&#x27;s when I decided to change strategies and started using Solar Oil.  I found that my nails started to look and feel better almost immediately.  You have to keep using it though, and that s probably the key thing -- the discipline to keep applying it.  The oil itself is a fairly mundane combination of Vitamin E and oil, mostly sweet almond oil by the smell of it.  This is a very simply remedy to a major nail problem.  I think almost any oil, constantly applied, would work, but this is very pleasant to use.</li>
    <li> The brush is a little thin but otherwise this product is perfect.  It keeps my nails healthy and my cuticles soft and nice.  I put it on every night and it doesn&#x27;t take long to soak in.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this cuticle oil.  My manicure is not finished without it.  I also use it every day to help mosturize my cuticles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read other people ranting and raving about Solar Oil, and after not finding too much luck with other cuticle oils, I finally decided to try this one out. I have to say, I am sorry I waited so long!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application is like a dream, it absorbs into the skin fairly quickly (so you don&#x27;t have to worry about being oily for too long), and it smells absolutely fantastic!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only been using Solar Oil for a little over a week, but I have already seen a difference in the health and appearance of my nails and cuticles. I do not think I can recommend this product highly enough! If you find yourself wondering if this is a good oil to use, stop wondering and just start enjoying it for yourself already!</li>
    <li> This is the best product out there! Works great! Says to use once a day, but I use it twice. Love the smell.</li>
    <li> very good when used consistently</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 10 years. Its the best I have found. The smell is FANTASTIC and it doesn&#x27;t leave your fingers all greasy feeling after. I usually put this on while at work (because when I am at home I am usually too busy - ironic right?). I put this on my cuticles, let it sit for a minute, then rub it in to each cuticle and nail fully. Afterwards, I rub lotion onto my hands, cuticles, and nails which minimizes the oiliness. Doing this works great while I&#x27;m at the office. Allows me to keep typing while keeping my keyboard clean. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> Works great to keep cuticles looking healthy.  Love the smell of almond oil</li>
    <li> This is the best cuticle oil I have found. Great after a mani or pedi or just to give your nail extra hydration.</li>
    <li> Using this oil every night has solved a dry-cuticle problem for me.  It has a nice almond smell and isn&#x27;t greasy.  Massaging just a small drop on each nail/cuticle area nightly keeps them looking smooth and neat.</li>
    <li> I head about this product and bought 1 bottle. It worked so well I ordered 2 more. My nails look great.</li>
    <li> I saw this solar oil at a beauty supply store in the mall for $11.  I paid less than $8.  This solar oil absorbs into my nails quickly and very well.  I am very happy with this product.  I&#x27;m thrilled with the price!</li>
    <li> I use this to top off the NailTek Citra Formaldehyde Free #2; am very happy with the combination.  Put some of this on cuticles and under tips of nails(if you have dry skin) in addition to on top of nail.</li>
    <li> I am a dude however I use this to keep hangnails from occurring. It works like a charm! I would get a hang nail then bite and pull it then my fingers would look terrible. Long story short, this stuff works great if you have that issue as well. My only issue is that it comes in a nail polish jar... so I get a lot of flack from friends who come over if i forget to put it up. God forbid they walked in while i was applying it on my fingers and toes haha. Anyhow, great stuff, I now know why folks dig this stuff!</li>
    <li> Keeps my cuticles moist.  Seeps in and isn&#x27;t greasy!! I put it on my toes too.  This should help the ridges that were forming from the dryness in my cuticles.</li>
    <li> Easily absorbed.  Works great on keeping cuticles soft and nails looking good. Smells good too.</li>
    <li> Best thing I have ever used for my cuticles. With regular use it really makes a difference.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this, it is so nice and luxurious.  Goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly and leaves that lovely scent.  Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this oil but I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s just almond oil in fancy packaging. I have the worst dry cuticles in the winter, especially the skin on the sides of the thumb. I find there&#x27;s no point in applying the oil when the skin is bone dry but best after hands have been washed and the skin is slightly damp. Otherwise it&#x27;s like brushing oil onto a mirror where it won&#x27;t really absorb and gets rubbed away. It has worked on the less drier cuticles but hasn&#x27;t really helped on the much drier other fingers. Smell is great but other cuticle oils can do the same job for a lesser price.</li>
    <li> I have been using solar oil for more than a year now and I swear by it. Goodbye dry cuticles!</li>
    <li> i have my nails shellacked.  no artificial nails and this oil keeps the cuticles from becoming too dry.  the cuticles remain soft, they don&#x27;t overgrow the nails and never split or crack.  use it, you&#x27;ll be very glad you did.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years. In fact it helps strengthen my nails allowing them to grow and not crack. If I use it daily.  Great on my toes after a pedicure helps mois.t uprise around the nail ed to prevent polish from looking worn.</li>
    <li> The photo of this item is very misleading. It implies there is one bottle .5 oz size. In fact, I received FOUR bottles 1/8 oz each. While the total amount is the same, I would not have ordered had I known this. In fact, I was studiously avoiding ordering from other Marketplace sellers that had the tiny bottles. I ordered from this one because I wanted a bigger size.There is always some product you can&#x27;t get out of the bottom of a bottle, so it feels like much more will be wasted with four bottles than one. The product itself is great, but I&#x27;m pretty unhappy with the false advertising.</li>
    <li> I use this nail oil for my nails and cuticles every time I do a manicure.  The oil penetrates into the nail and cuticle very nicely and does not leave an oily residue at all.  My nails are extremely dry and this oil moisturizes them and keeps them from breaking off.  I will continue to use this product as long as they make it as it works so well for my nails and dry cuticles.  Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> really good thid product for dry the shellac...</li>
    <li> It does make a difference.</li>
    <li> It is amazing and shippment was on time.</li>
    <li> My nails are now much stronger with significantly less breakage. I had one nail with ridges that would constantly peel and break , now after a few weeks I can see how much stronger it is. In fact the overall health of my nails have improved tremendously and they look shiny, healthy and strong. Fabulous buy.</li>
    <li> Good product. It seems to help tame my cuticles.</li>
    <li> I use this product on a regular basis especially in the winter. It keeps my nails and cuticles nicely conditioned. The bottle lasts a really long time and the natural ingredients are a plus.</li>
    <li> Using Orly FX and this was recommended by a Spa director friend. Nice almond scent, absorbs well and does condition cuticles well. Recommend</li>
    <li> Love this Solar Oil! It is so moisturizing to my cuticles. My skin is very dry around my nail beds and desperately needed something to keep skin from splitting. This does the trick! I apply it 1-2 times daily. It makes my nails/cuticles look very healthy and has helped repair my surrounding skin! Great product!</li>
    <li> I have artificial nails and I love the way this oil conditions my cuticles and nails.  I try to use it twice a day.  I think it is great for natural or artificial nails.</li>
    <li> I have been using this around my fingernails and toenails for several years. It really keeps the skin moist.  Your pedicure will look great and when wearing sandals the skin around the nails looks healthy.  I have tried other oils, but none of them worked as well as this.</li>
    <li> I wear this nightly on my toes. It smells so good &amp; leaves them feeling super soft &amp; healthy.</li>
    <li> I love using solar oil on my nail and cuticles. keeps them hydrated and looking nice. I use it nightly on my fingers and toes.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of it. I&#x27;m just to lazy to apply daily so I haven&#x27;t noticed much improvement yet.</li>
    <li> Finally an end to peeling, splitting nails. I will buy this again.  Liked it a bit more than OPI Avoplex.</li>
    <li> After removing my acrylic nails which I&#x27;ve had for well over 20 years, I found myself searching for natural nail care products.  I came across this oil after seeing a \\&quot;natural nail care\\&quot; video on YouTube.  The manicurist in the video highly recommended this product.  I hesitated a bit cause of the price &amp; so I started using olive oil with pure garlic in it.  This did do a nice job.  But finally my hubby gifted me this product &amp; let me tell you, ITS LIKE BUTTER! The difference is like night &amp; day. The olive oil did work ok, however, I did notice that it took a while for my cuticles to absorb the oil.  However, this product is so silky &amp; buttery that my cuticles absorb it immediately &amp; it smells terrific. I am sold on this product.  I will most definitely continue using it, LOVE IT! I do plan on continuing to use the olive/garlic oil through the day, &amp; this product at bedtime.</li>
    <li> Very good product, very good price . Came very fast . Happy with  my purchase. I would recommend to other people. Thanks</li>
    <li> This is the best possible oil you can use for your nails! LOVE it! I&#x27;ve been using it for years</li>
    <li> My cuticles look completely different (and healthy!).  Wish I found out about this sooner. Keep it near my bed, and put it on right before I go to sleep at night.</li>
    <li> I thought this would come in one bottle of .5 oz but apparently not, as I got this in 4 itty bitty bottles to equal .5 oz.  Although this was a pleasant surprise considering this wasn&#x27;t for a salon purchase and rather for my personal use, so it made it nice to have the itty bitty bottles, now I have one for the car, my purse, my office, and my nightstand! ;)</li>
    <li> This stuff works wonders. I have gotten my nails done for ten years plus and my natural nails were so brittle they ripped right off. After taking the acrylics off I was told by kandiyamz to get solar oil. After one week of this I could see a major change. Been using for two months and my nails grew back completely and better than ive felt them in years</li>
