### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The Xylitol gum produces saliva in my mouth and is so superior than Biotene.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s handy to carry in my purse when I&#x27;m out and about.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t rate it at all, but I liked it</li>
      <li>When I have found it in stores it has never been more than $2.00 plus tax for 16 pieces.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad she did because it saves me from my dreaded &amp;#34;camel mouth&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Bought this for my sister, but I love Biotene</li>
      <li>But it does seem to work faster and better than the liquid squirt type</li>
      <li>I sure hope it was not taken of the market.</li>
      <li>I love Biotene gum too</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t pay more the 4.00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tonya</li>
      <li>Sincerely, David GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare&amp;#34</li>
      <li>I think this is the best gum for dry mouth out there.</li>
      <li>This item helps my dry mouth alot and it&#x27;s very good tasting.</li>
      <li>the fine print</li>
      <li>I mis read seeing there were 6 packages available thinking I was buying all 6 packages.  </li>
      <li>and I didn&#x27;t order sugar free.</li>
      <li>EPIC DENTAL is SUPERIOR in Taste, Cost, Service, &amp; Quality.</li>
      <li>First of all I thought I was getting more than just one box.  </li>
      <li>Great gum for people with dry mouth.  </li>
      <li>It not only is good for dry mouth, it cleans and I got a perfect Dental Report for the first time in 13 years, due to my sickness.&lt;br /&gt;Mix and Match Xylitol Gum, 12-piece packs, 5 packs(62 individual pieces for $6.50).</li>
      <li>The problem is, the price is way to much.  </li>
      <li>It works very well to create moisture, however it sticks to your teeth and gets in between.</li>
      <li>really works!&lt;br</li>
      <li>I use other Biotene products and thought this would be a handy and quick relief gum for my dry mouth symptoms.  </li>
      <li>could get it at a decent price.</li>
      <li>WOW!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m surprised!  </li>
      <li>It is hard to find the gum in the floor but is one of the best biotene products for my dry mouth because I have deep cracks in my tongue the rinse and the spray and toothpaste cause extreme pain.  </li>
      <li>They said this should happen early in 2014.</li>
      <li>As near as I can tell, the gum has been discontinued.</li>
      <li>I intend to dispute this charge unless I receive my complete order at no charge</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure how this stuff can be sold for the kind of money that is being asked since you can by a single box of 16 for just around $2.00.  </li>
      <li>This is a great gum but very expensive.</li>
      <li>I ended up paying $46.50 for 2 small packs of gum because it was unclear the size of the &amp;#34;box&amp;#34; they advertised as available.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It immediately solved the dry mouth symptoms with a gentle mint flavor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I contacted Biotene and they said there had been a delay in the manufacturing process that should be resolved sometime in the near future, and then the product would be back on the shelves.</li>
      <li>I purchased a small sample of gum, decided what I like &amp; ordered Fresh Fruit Xylitol Gum, 12-piece packs, Box of 12 packs cost me $15.60 and</li>

<li> This product not only helps with dry mouth issues, but it freshens breath as well.</li>
<li> Too bad; it has been a handy way to carry the medication around in a purse.</li>
<li> I received this email from the makers of Biotene Gum: &amp;#34;At the present time, Biotene® Gum is out of stock due to a manufacturing delay.</li>
<li> Once back in the stores, the gum sells for less than $3.  </li>
<li> Spent around $17 for what costs $1.99 when I can find it at the drug store.  </li>
<li> Its not worth the money you are paying for it.  </li>
<li> but I&#x27;m not going to pay this ridiculous amount when I can use one of their other products until they get the gum back on the market.</li>
<li> I thought it mean one box of several packs of gum.</li>
<li> I called the number on the Biotene gum and found it was not available.  </li>
<li> mail a few time about not finding it  and never heard a thing from them.</li>
<li> yes one box cost over $90.00, had trouble returning it</li>
<li> Going to look for something else less expensive but will help with a dry mouth.</li>
<li> Upon receiving  these 2 small packs of gum,I felt deceived and reuturned the purchase.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately, after only a few minutes of chewing the benefit seems used up!</li>
<li> My husband is ill and needed that gum for dry mouth from medications</li>
<li> Why is this stuff so hard to find?</li>
<li> The problem is that the product is hard to find.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know why, but this gum is hard to find, anywhere.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m sorry but GOD knows who you are and he will take care of people that take advantage of other people the way you did .</li>
<li> EpicDental gum does not get tough to chew which is a blessing also.</li>
<li> Expensive lesson for me.  </li>
<li> I am sorry that I ordered it.  </li>
<li> 50.00 for 16 PC of gum is crazy.</li>
<li> Yes I would hate to pay those crazy prices.</li>
<li> This was a horrible experience..  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t pay these outrageous prices.</li>

    <li> It works very well to create moisture, however it sticks to your teeth and gets in between. But it does seem to work faster and better than the liquid squirt type</li>
    <li> Never received it. I don&#x27;t know why, but this gum is hard to find, anywhere. What happened to it? I wouldn&#x27;t rate it at all, but I liked it when&lt;br /&gt;I could get it at a decent price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how this stuff can be sold for the kind of money that is being asked since you can by a single box of 16 for just around $2.00.  So beware the pricing on Amazon.  Not sure who is finally responsible, but it is irresponsible.  The problem is that the product is hard to find.</li>
    <li> This was a horrible experience..  I ended up paying $46.50 for 2 small packs of gum because it was unclear the size of the &amp;#34;box&amp;#34; they advertised as available.  Of course there was no way to clarify.  Upon receiving  these 2 small packs of gum,I felt deceived and reuturned the purchase.  I was only credited $36.00 for my return and had to pay for postage for my return.  I will never buy from Amazon again.</li>
    <li> First of all I thought I was getting more than just one box.  When it said one box I thought it mean one box of several packs of gum. I was pissed when it arrived and I realized that I paid $23 and change for 16 pieces of gum and I didn&#x27;t order sugar free. It is hard to find the gum in the floor but is one of the best biotene products for my dry mouth because I have deep cracks in my tongue the rinse and the spray and toothpaste cause extreme pain.  When I have found it in stores it has never been more than $2.00 plus tax for 16 pieces. THIS IS A BIG RIP OFF!!!</li>
    <li> Ineffective  Too expensive&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Feb. 3, 2014 I received this email from the makers of Biotene Gum: &amp;#34;At the present time, Biotene® Gum is out of stock due to a manufacturing delay. We don&#x27;t expect you to see the gum available on shelf at retailers until approximately the second quarter of 2014. We appreciate your patience as we work diligently to resolve this matter. If we can be of further assistance, please contact one of our Representatives at 1-800-922-5856 weekdays between 9:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Sincerely, David GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare&amp;#34; The second quarter is April - June. So hang on people!  Once back in the stores, the gum sells for less than $3.  Don&#x27;t pay these outrageous prices!</li>
    <li> I take several prescription meds that give me post nasal drip. I had never even heard of such a thing until my doctor told me what was going on and recommended all these Biotene products. I&#x27;m glad she did because it saves me from my dreaded &amp;#34;camel mouth&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I use other Biotene products and thought this would be a handy and quick relief gum for my dry mouth symptoms.  Unfortunately, after only a few minutes of chewing the benefit seems used up!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry but GOD knows who you are and he will take care of people that take advantage of other people the way you did . You rip me off and you know it. sue T</li>
    <li> WOW!  I&#x27;m surprised!  This stuff really works!&lt;br /&gt;It immediately solved the dry mouth symptoms with a gentle mint flavor.&lt;br /&gt;I am thankful for the relief Biotene products give me.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely keep this in all my pockets!</li>
    <li> I never thought I would pay $30 for a pack of 16 pieces of gum.  I mis read seeing there were 6 packages available thinking I was buying all 6 packages.  I paid $2.10 for the last package I could find at a local drug store. I called the number on the Biotene gum and found it was not available.  My husband is ill and needed that gum for dry mouth from medications he is on.  I am sorry that I ordered it.  That&#x27;s a lot of money for 16 pieces of gum.</li>
    <li> I ordered 5 packs of gum for a cost of $l3.40,but I only received 1(one) pack of gum. I have been charged for the total cost of $13.40 and shipping and handling of$8.98 which is rediculus.  I intend to dispute this charge unless I receive my complete order at no charge</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t realize one box yes one box cost over $90.00, had trouble returning it&lt;br /&gt;I suppose to got my money back I don&#x27;t see it on my statement.&lt;br /&gt;read the fine print</li>
    <li> the wording in the ad was misleading; made me think i was buying 16 packaged of bio-tene, not 1 pack with 16 pieces</li>
    <li> This item helps my dry mouth alot and it&#x27;s very good tasting.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t pay these outrageous prices. I contacted Biotene and they said there had been a delay in the manufacturing process that should be resolved sometime in the near future, and then the product would be back on the shelves. I love Biotene gum too but I&#x27;m not going to pay this ridiculous amount when I can use one of their other products until they get the gum back on the market. They said this should happen early in 2014.</li>
    <li> Searching internet for Xylitol Gum I found EpicDental.com. Please&lt;br /&gt;All of EpicDental products have Xylitol: gum, mints, sweetener, toothpaste, &amp; mouthwash. It not only is good for dry mouth, it cleans and I got a perfect Dental Report for the first time in 13 years, due to my sickness.&lt;br /&gt;Mix and Match Xylitol Gum, 12-piece packs, 5 packs(62 individual pieces for $6.50). I purchased a small sample of gum, decided what I like &amp; ordered Fresh Fruit Xylitol Gum, 12-piece packs, Box of 12 packs cost me $15.60 and Peppermint Xylitol Gum, 12-piece packs, Box of 12 packs for $15.60. The Xylitol gum produces saliva in my mouth and is so superior than Biotene. EpicDental gum does not get tough to chew which is a blessing also. EPIC DENTAL is SUPERIOR in Taste, Cost, Service, &amp; Quality.</li>
    <li> This is a great gum but very expensive. Going to look for something else less expensive but will help with a dry mouth.</li>
    <li> As near as I can tell, the gum has been discontinued. Too bad; it has been a handy way to carry the medication around in a purse.</li>
    <li> This product not only helps with dry mouth issues, but it freshens breath as well. It&#x27;s handy to carry in my purse when I&#x27;m out and about.</li>
    <li> I thought I was getting 16 packages and instead recieved 1 pack with 16 pieces of gum in it.  Spent around $17 for what costs $1.99 when I can find it at the drug store.  Expensive lesson for me.  Why is this stuff so hard to find?</li>
    <li> I was charged 55,99 for 2 boxes of biotene gum that cost $2.15 at my local store. I ordered 2 boxes of 16 packeges each/ Atotal of 32 boxes . What the heck is going on???</li>
    <li> Great gum for people with dry mouth.  The problem is, the price is way to much.  Its not worth the money you are paying for it.  Feel like I was scammed.</li>
    <li> 50.00 for 16 PC of gum is crazy. I was offered my money back. Mom needed it so we paid the price. Jeez!</li>
    <li> I think this is the best gum for dry mouth out there. I e- mail a few time about not finding it  and never heard a thing from them. I sure hope it was not taken of the market. Yes I would hate to pay those crazy prices. I don&#x27;t pay more the 4.00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tonya</li>
    <li> Too Costly had to return !!!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my sister, but I love Biotene</li>
