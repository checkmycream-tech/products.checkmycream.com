<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> it&#x27;s nice for not costing too much, but it doesn&#x27;t really save any time relative to a blade razor, so I feel like I end up spending JUST as much time and looking scruffy on top of it, since it also doesn&#x27;t do a really great job shaving. Also it gives me a bit of razor-burn under the chin.</li>
    <li> It took my skin some getting used to but it gets a nice close shave and that&#x27;s all I wanted.</li>
    <li> Ive had one of these shavers for about 3 years now, and I only bought a new one because I needed new blades and a new shaver only cost about 2 or 3 dollars more than the replacement blades.  Its not as close as a razor of course but it does the job on my face, and even gives a passable shave on my head when I don&#x27;t feel like using a razor.  Its not rechargeable, which I like, because  the power level is constant and doesn&#x27;t fade like with battery ones.  The only down side to the shaver is that the little trimmer on the side seems to be completely useless, I&#x27;ve never been able to do any decent edging with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 89 year old father who has dementia. I was concerned with him using a manual razor because it was getting more and more difficult for him to use, and I didn&#x27;t want him to cut himself. This electric razor has turned out great.</li>
    <li> I received this on time as I get very good service from Amazon except for FedEx they use can not find where I live. The razor does the job I am going to be getting another one soon.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Lightning Deal. Pros - it was $20. For a $20 shaver, it works great. Cons - it was $20. It performs like you&#x27;d expect a $20 shaver to - keep in mind that $20 buys you a really nice disposable razor these days. I wish I went that route. If I go a day or two without shaving, it misses a lot of hairs because they&#x27;re too long, and the hairs it DOES get, it usually pulls them out. Gives me horrible razor burn on my neck. If you hate life, this is the shaver for you.</li>
    <li> My last shaver was a Norelco Reflex Plus 6  6423LC, corded, case included. Bought in 2004.  It has served me well, but I guess I failed to RTFM (read the fine manual). I should have been replacing the heads much more often. It really only needed new heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the heads seemed to vary in price from about $16 to about $30. So I bought this one for about what the heads would cost. (It was $30.66 at the time.) It shaves fine. The cord is \\&quot;tight\\&quot;, meaning that it has not stretched yet. I know it may seem short, but just stretch it a few times. It will (probably) be OK after more use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no case with this shaver. But I didn&#x27;t need another case.  And the heads from this one will work on my old one. A real plus if the motor would happen to conk out on the new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con I can think of is the way the head cover is made. Seems cheap, but it does protect the head. The head holder that snaps onto the shaver is just a little different on the outside than my old one, so I can&#x27;t snap my old head cover onto this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to my friends.</li>
    <li> When it came time to replace my old razor with a new one, I decided on the Norelco 6940 Shaving System.&lt;br /&gt;It had every future that I was looking for in my electric  razor.  But I noticed that the cord was not as long as my&lt;br /&gt;older modal .......... but overall, I&#x27;m satisfied, and would recommend this product !!!!</li>
    <li> What can I say, it is cheap, corded and gets the job done.  Build quality is adequate, blades are replaceable and far better when compared to similar Remington model.  Not the  fastest shave but I favor it over Braun 3 series by a small margin.  Suspect this will be a personal choice but deserves to be on your &amp;#34;short list&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> If not in China, I would apply for return! by the way, I love the Usa！Because the United States of America is a democratic country！</li>
    <li> Does a good job. I could use some of the old Burma Shave slogans, that were posted along the roadways in the early 1950&#x27;s, but I have never been real thrilled about having to take time to shave anyway. Norelco always does a good job for me.</li>
    <li> I can deal with the fact that this device is corded. But even so, i would expect it to have a little oomph and power. Sadly this is hardly the case! This is my second day using it and i cannot get a close shave! And what is this obsession all electric razors have with this &amp;#34;flex&amp;#34; technology. ITS NOT ONLY NOT EFFECTIVE BUT DEFEATS THE PURPOSE!  A razor is supposed to hug the skin, not shy away from it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend this product at all!</li>
    <li> I used Norelco before and I loved it. This product is better than Remington, but the head is expensive. I hope the price will be reduced in the future .</li>
    <li> For years I used regular bladed razors and shave gel.  When I had tried electric razors a few years ago, I was underwhelmed...  Until about a year ago when I tried a high end electric razor, also purchased on Amazon.  When the foils ended up damaged from a drop in the shower, I found this entire razor for less than the cost of just my expensive razor&#x27;s foils.  At this price point, I&#x27;m quite happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy on the bank account.&lt;br /&gt;Shaves almost as well as my $150 razor did, though this is a plug-in dry shaver only.&lt;br /&gt;Extending cord stretches okay.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to do a daily cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not as close of a shave as a blade (though none I&#x27;ve tried really are)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the cord pop out a couple times when I&#x27;ve moved a little too far from the plug (while shaving it seems like it should  stretch a bit further than it actually does)&lt;br /&gt;Not easy to do a deep clean, keep your instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would definitely recommend this razor to the budget conscious shaver or someone wanting to take an electric on a trip.  It&#x27;s great at what it does as a budget option.  Just don&#x27;t buy it expecting a $150+ shave.</li>
    <li> I recently made the decision to shave my head (not much left up there anyway) and I wanted a nice, simple corded shaver to keep it shaved. This one looked like the one so I bought it. It does feel a little bit lightweight, not as heavy duty as I expected out of the Norelco name, but it worked right out of the box and the pop up trimmer does an excellent job of trimming my goatee and mustache. I feel confident I made the right choice with this purchase.</li>
    <li> works okay not quite as good as the old norelco. after go over some areas a couple of times</li>
    <li> cheap made  wont stay pluged in</li>
    <li> I buy a new Norelco Corded Shaver every couple of years&lt;br /&gt;instead of changing blade assy.&lt;br /&gt;Replacement blades cost almost as much as a new shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Shaver is very reasonably priced,gives super close shave for electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;I love it!</li>
    <li> norelco it a very nice shaver.  This model does not go cordless.  Which is why it is less expensive.</li>
    <li> It hasbeen awhile since I had anelectric rasor. I&#x27;m glad I chose this one. It is quiet and shaves realy close I recomend this to anyone that wants a smooth shave</li>
    <li> Great shaver that will never die (it&#x27;s plugged in). Also very quiet. Great price too.</li>
    <li> Bought for someone else.  He said he likes it.</li>
    <li> I am a long-time norelco user.  After a couple of years, the battery of my norelco shavers dies and it is time to get a new one.  Because of that, I have actually never needed to buy replacement blades.  In any case, a few months ago, I was reading some comparisons and the Braun came out on top for the \\&quot;closest shave\\&quot;.  Despite being happy with norelco, I buy a very pricey Braun Series 7 790CC shaver.  What a huge disappointment!  I saw this shaver on amazon for cheap and didn&#x27;t want to blow any more money on shavers so bought this.  Love that it is corded.  The plastic is lightweight and cheap so don&#x27;t go dropping it.  The head detachment looks like it might be prone to breakage so just detach the head carefully.  Performance wise, this shaver is simply perfection.  I can get my shaving done in 30 seconds compared to a minute and a half with the Braun.  The Braun also tends to leave hairs untouched!  Bottom line, I will never buy another braun again ever and this low cost norelco is everything I ever wanted in a shaver--you do not need to spend more!  My only wish would be that the coiled power cord was a little longer--like 50% longer.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas present for my boyfriend. I read some negative and some positive reviews, so I was kinda skeptical.  The product came quickly, it&#x27;s packaging looked cheap but the products itself looks fine.  He and I are both too poor for an \\&quot;expensive\\&quot; shaver. But so far he&#x27;s said it works great and functions in all the ways he needs, so we are very satisfied. Yay!</li>
    <li> I had used Norelco shavers since 1980. That tells you how much I like them. On a recent trip I lost one that I had been using for over 10 years (forgot what model).  I got adventurous and brought this cheap corded model because changing blades and battery on my old ones were expensive.  I figure at $32 I can replace the whole thing when the blades or battery go bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I got what I paid for - a low end product that is night and day compared with what I had before. The motor is lethargic; the blades are not sharp; the cord is too short; low shaving performance in the wrinkled area under the chin...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have paid more to get a better model.  Or at least check out other brands.</li>
    <li> Works well after a year.  Wish the cord was longer.  I have replaced the blades and they are easy to find. I&#x27;m old school and prefer the cord to rechargeable battery models.  Simple with less to go wrong as several rechargeables I&#x27;ve had have failed prematurely.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver one year ago, and now the cutting action is greatly reduced.  I bought the same shaver again as a replacement in order to return to the excellent shaving experience I experienced when it was new. The cutting head needs to be replaced after one year. Otherwise, this shaver performs well.</li>
    <li> This item replaced another Norelco Reflex corded shaver that had lasted at least 10 years. (A plastic part which supports the blade assemblies broke after years of use.) Since I was very satisfied with my previous Reflex, I bought a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a basic Norelco shaver. It is corded, which I consider a plus since in my experience batteries always seem to fail before the device itself. It has 3 \\&quot;floating heads\\&quot; and a pop-up trimmer. The unit is light weight and very quiet - even more quiet than the one it replaced. The shave is not as close as a manual blade but is comparable to all the other Norelcos I have used over the past 40 years. The trimmer works great. All in all, a great buy if you just want the basics done right.</li>
    <li> Use it every day! Works well.</li>
    <li> I bought this same electric shaver from K Mart over two years ago and am still using the original blades.  It is amazing.  I clean the head about once a week and take it apart and clean the blades about every month and it shaves just as well now as the day I bought it. I recently bought one here on Amazon for my Dad and he loves his too.  He shaved with a blade for 70 years but said he was tired of the irritation. The sideburn trimmer works well and the shaver is easy to handle and you dont have to worry about charging it.  This has to be one of the most economical yet great cutting electric shavers ever and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> thats a very old basic model, its not suitable for senistive skin , it causes a huge amount of acne , in the catalog it says use it for 3 weeks then judge..... i ve been using it for more than a month now and my face is really got alot of acne, i will go back to my prev shaving machine i used to have Braun Cruzer 4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this one comes with a very short cord and it not a chargable machine so mostly u will be tied to the wall socket and for my good luck i had a socket near enough to the mirror to be able to see my self but the cord was tensed to the max which doesnt let u have a painless shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DONT BUY IT, it aint worth the money</li>
    <li> I ordered this product and received it in a timely manner.  This product was packaged very well and arrived in excellent condition.  Husband has been using this shaver daily and likes the way it shaves his face.  Much easier than shaving the \\&quot;old fashioned way\\&quot; with the other shaving system.  I would recommend this shaver highly.  Easy to use, and gives a comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> I have had this for a few months now, and have used similar Norelco razors over the years.  It does the job.  You save a lot of $$ because you are not paying for a battery.  I prefer this model with no battery because it never slows down due to weak battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 3 spinning blades design works SO much better than the 1 bar-shaped design used by most other brands, especially on your neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  If you have more than 1-2 days stubble, you will have issues.  As a work-around, I use the trimmer first, then the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband over a year ago and its still working great! This is a great buy and worth the money!</li>
    <li> This is my first plug-in electric shaver. I was looking for razor that was simple and inexpensive. The norelco 6940 has done a great job so far, I use it shave about three times weekly and I get a relatively closed shave every time. There is no need for recharge, just plug it in take and  care of business. When done it can be stored away out of site.  I highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is the 4th Norelco shaver that I have bought in the past 35 years. The first was a Cordless model so when the shaver would not charge anymore it was worthless so I only bought electric shavers after that. The previous electric razors were ok but did not do a good job on my neck. The Norelco 6940 did an excellent job on my neck to I am Very satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> Since it has no battery it is very light. Very quiet. I&#x27;ve used it for a month and have no complaints except that the cord is just too short. I used a short extension cord and that solves the problem.</li>
    <li> Got this for my son as his first shaver. He&#x27;s a teen and so a razor was not the best option. This electric shaver glides easily over his face and does not disturb any blemishes. It gets the job done quickly and cheaply. Definitely a good choice.</li>
    <li> Good price and works well.  Plug it in and off it goes!  Simple, reliable and gets the job done.  No battery to worry about!</li>
    <li> The manual says to use this product exclusively for 21 days to give your face time to adapt to the shaving system. For users like me, this is an unforgivably long grace period. A well-engineered razor should adapt to your face. Your face should not have to adapt to the razor. I was disappointed from the very first shave and after a few more shaving attempts, abandoned it to go back to disposables. With every single shave, I had to clean up strays with a disposable, especially around the neck and under the chin. But in order to write a fair review, I started using it again 2 wks ago and decided to complete the 21 day trial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After these 2 new weeks, I continue to be disappointed. This razor under-performs compared to other electrics I&#x27;ve used in the past. I&#x27;m not a hairy guy but my facial hair does grow back fast, requiring a quick shave every 2 days. If my facial hair grew just slightly longer (3-4 days), the \\&quot;lift and cut\\&quot; system becomes an irritating \\&quot;yank and cut\\&quot; system. The motor is either not fast enough or not powerful enough to keep pace as I roll the razor across my face. This was never a problem with past electrics I&#x27;ve owned, like the Remington Microscreen product line. Norelco&#x27;s triple head design here add nothing to the functionality, and in fact, detract from the shaving performance in a major way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;Patented Reflex Action System\\&quot; which was supposed to adjust \\&quot;automatically to every curve on your face and neck for an uncommonly smooth shave\\&quot; did not adjust to mine at all. Shaving with this takes me a lot longer and requires more effort than with a manual razor or my old Remington. The entire reason is the small active surface area of the heads. The actual cutting zone is a very small target consisting of only the outer ring of each circular head, which hair must poke itself through in order to get cut. As you pass the razor over your face, the hair must hit one of these small sweet-spots to get lifted and cut away. Every other part of the razor&#x27;s face besides the rings is simply a dead-weight non-cutting surface, resulting in a lot of missed hairs whether using straight strokes or circular motions. The Remingtons, by contrast, offer a wide horizontal head with a lot of active surface area and requires much fewer strokes across the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The few design aspects I did like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- elastic bungee cord plug minimizes entanglement and accidents&lt;br /&gt;- flip-out sideburns trimmer works, though also small surface area&lt;br /&gt;- rubberized non-slip grip&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue the experiment for 1 more wk, as the manual instructs and update as needed. I am not impressed so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Nov 27, 2009: I continue to be frustrated by this razor&#x27;s performance. It&#x27;s simply not a good product.&#x27;s face besides the rings is simply a dead-weight non-cutting surface, resulting in a lot of missed hairs whether using straight strokes or circular motions.

    <li> I would highly recommend this product. It gives you a very close shave &amp; it is very quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always had electric razors &amp; Norelco products never have disappointed me.  If you are looking for a new electric razor then don&#x27;t miss purchasing this one.</li>
    <li> I would give the shaver itself , 5 stars , when the blades are sharp , you get a comfortable close shave , as smooth as a babys bottom . However it is totally ridiculous how much the replacement blades  cost . In my case , they cost 55% more than I paid for the shaver . So I am either going to get a blade sharpener or a new shaver . There just is no way I am going to pay 32 dollars for razor blades .</li>
    <li> This shaver is a very good product for the price!  Easy to clean, easy to manage, and provides a very close shave!  I have sensitive skin + bumps that cause my neck to be fairly blood-spotted after a manual shave.  This shaver, with the same closeness, provides NO nicks, cuts, and scratches when used properly!  Definitely give it 3 weeks for you/your skin to get used to it; it&#x27;s worth the wait.  Very highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for my Uncle and unfortunately it was a final sale and it is defective.  I took a chance and lost my money.  I must add that this is the first&lt;br /&gt;time I have purchased from Amazon and have been disappointed.</li>
    <li> I bought the 6940LC about a month ago to replace an older corded Norelco model (3405LC?) whose motor jammed and smoked after about a decade of use.  The 6940LC seems to be one of the only corded models still available.  As others have noted, it is very quiet but at the expense of being slower and weaker than one would expect in a plug-in product.  It sounds and feels like it is running on a pair of AA batteries.  I&#x27;d estimate it&#x27;s taking about 20% longer to get the job done, but the shave is pretty close, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be any more or less irritating to my skin.  It&#x27;s probably beneficial to not be holding an 80 dB noisemaker less than a foot from one&#x27;s ears every day, but a faster shave would have a more immediate payoff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver has a pleasant, ergonomic shape, but unlike previous models, the triangular assembly that holds the three heads only snaps on in a single orientation.  With older models, you could even out the wear on the three cutters by snapping this assembly back on in a different orientation after cleaning, since it was rotationally symmetrical.  With the 6940LC, you can&#x27;t do this... you&#x27;d have to disassemble and move the three cutting heads manually.  Looks to me like someone introduced this hassle to hopefully sell more blades...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have noted, the cord is a little too short, and this shaver is WAY overpackaged in both a box and multiple layers of tough, molded plastic that have to be carefully cut apart with box cutters.</li>
    <li> This is a good corded electric shaver that replaces an old Norelco I used for many many years with great success.  I have cordless ones I use for camping and travel, but they do not seem to do what this type does.&lt;br /&gt;I see no need to spend large sums of money on fancy new do-dads when the old basic ones do the job for me.</li>
    <li> Nothing fancy but it does the job it&#x27;s intended to do. The price is not bad and it&#x27;s even an attractive razor. The only problem is that the cord is too short. I took the one off the old razor I was retiring and it fit just fine. No problems nor do I expect any from a Norelco.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a long string of Norelco electric razors over the past 30+ years, and this one is the latest. This is the basic, corded, least-expensive (I believe) version of Norelco&#x27;s razors, and it works just fine. It is quiet (much quieter than the last one I had) and efficient. It gives a nice, smooth shave without a lot of fuss. I&#x27;ve never used one of the more expensive, premium, rechargeable Norelco razors, but I can&#x27;t believe you could get a much closer shave from them than you get from this no-frills model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only had this one for a few weeks, but the Norelco razors I&#x27;ve owned in the past have held up very well over time. In general, they tend to last about three or four years. If you replace the floating razor heads, it would probably last even longer, but the replacement heads tend to cost about as much as this entire razor, so I don&#x27;t see the point of doing that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned Norelco razors for about 30 years. In my experience, the quality just gets better. I&#x27;ve owned this one for only a few weeks, but it does an excellent job and is amazingly quiet. The replacement blades are rather expensive, but since the razors have always lasted me ten years or more, getting new blades is like getting a new razor at a discount. I bought this particular one because it is simple and because it is NOT cordless. I prefer the steady, reliable power of a cord, and I don&#x27;t see the justification for adding the waste of a battery and charger to the landfill. I heartily recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a young man with autism, as his first electric shaver. He is using it himself, and gets a good shave. How much better could it be.</li>
    <li> USED THIS RAZOR FOR 2 WEEKS AND SENT IT BACK. I THOUGHT IT WAS A TOY FOR TRAINING TEEN AGERS FOR THEIR FIRST SHAVES. I WOULD SHAVE AT 6 AM AND BY 5 PM IT LOOKE LIKE I FORGOT TO SHAVE THAT MORNING. SPEND $10 MORE AND BUY A MAN&#x27;S RAZOR.</li>
    <li> Amazon&#x27;s description does not say what the source of power is&lt;br /&gt;110 v or battery. This is quite a major difference and the unit should be refundable because of that omission. I was planning to buy a battery powered shaver.</li>
    <li> I ordered this shaver for my husband.  He is very pleased with the shaver.  I looked at several stores and the price on Amazon was so much better, that I ordered it immediately.  It was delivered without a hitch and we are very pleased with the purchase</li>
    <li> have used Norelco corded razor for 45 years. (710RL) This one is really quiet and does a good job with the whiskers. Norelco is the best !</li>
    <li> Though I have a more expensive Norelco shaver with battery charging for traveling, this inexpensive Norelco is great for everyday use and highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This electric razor really works very well. Its very quiet, not too heavy and does a great job of shaving my beard.I used it for the first time on a 3 day growth and was amazed how clean shaven my face was.For the price its a great buy, I&#x27;d buy another one.THANK YOU PCRAMER1</li>
    <li> I have a had norelco&#x27;s for years. I tend to buy the very basic ones. The plastic on this one is a bit cheaper then the last. But it still gives a great shave like all of them. I see it as a very good value.</li>
    <li> This shaver is great and less than half the price of a cordless.  I&#x27;m used to shaving at the bathroom sink facing the mirror.  I don&#x27;t mind plugging in a cord.  I have no need for a cordless shaver as I have never found a bathroom sink/mirror without a nearby electrical outlet to plug the shaver cord into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of buying new replacement blades for my norelco, I buy new shavers at just about the same price.</li>
    <li> I had a Remington Titanium rotary razor that served me well for several years,&lt;br /&gt;but it began to grab my skin regularly.  I thought I would try the Norelco&lt;br /&gt;since a) I think they invented the rotary razor, and b) I found a good price on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;So far it was an excellent choice.  If it lasts for several years and continues to shave&lt;br /&gt;as well as it does now, I will buy another one without hesitation.</li>
    <li> I am 64 yrs old and this is probably my 5th rotary shavor. My last shavor was corded also and lasted well over 10 years. The one time I bought a rechargeable shavor I did not like the shaving capability nor the recharging constantly. That one lasted 2 years and I threw it away. This razor is extremely quiet and I sometimes remove the cutting head to see if the motor is turning very fast. To date I have gotten a very close shave but I agree with some other reviewers that I believe the shaver could be more powerful. I placed this shavor next to my 10 yr old shavor, with the cutting head removed, and the mechanisms on the old shavor turn much faster. So the results are good, but I wonder how long this shavor will last based on my perceived belief about the power of the motor. I wonder why Phillips does not make a better quality, more powerful corded shavor. This appears to be their only corded model.</li>
    <li> I replaced my previous corded (single voltage) Norelco when I burned it out in Italy (I forgot to use a voltage converter).  I would rather have my old one.  This new double voltage model sacrifices speed for reduced noise. And while it is generally quieter, it makes a disturbing chattering sound. Norelco responded by repalcing the three comb and razor units, but should have replaced the entire head assembly. I will ask and see if they will repalce the entire head assembly.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for my husband two month ago and he is very happy with it. He says it is smooth and comfortable. I think is a great for the money product, it is relatively cheap, it has a good performance and always is ready to do the work, because it&#x27;s corded. Great decision!!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how quiet this thing is... it makes a light WHIRRING&lt;br /&gt;sound and cuts as good or better than the noisey buzz-bombs that I&lt;br /&gt;had used in the past. After reading the Owner&#x27;s Manual, it has been&lt;br /&gt;determined that this thing needs a monthly cleaning and a two-monthly&lt;br /&gt;cleaning... both types of cleaning are different. I took that Owner&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;Manual and put it inside a ZipLock sandwich bag to protect it from&lt;br /&gt;any water spills and store it under the vanity for instant reference&lt;br /&gt;when the required monthly cleanings are due.&lt;br /&gt;This is a truly very quiet shaver and it will not shake out your&lt;br /&gt;fillings in your teeth. I like it.&lt;br /&gt;The only bad thing is the short coiled cord that came with it...&lt;br /&gt;I use the old buzz-bomb razor cord which is about 5 or more feet in&lt;br /&gt;length. I never liked coiled cords anyhow... they have a habit of&lt;br /&gt;slapping you in the face... so the coiled cord derates it to a Four&lt;br /&gt;Star rating. This is my first Norelco... I like it muchly.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy another at this price.</li>
    <li> Really like this shaver. Of course the reason it is so cheap is because it was not designed with a battery. It runs off an outlet. But when I was getting it, it occured to me that I never shave anywhere where there isn&#x27;t an outlet anyway! And the lack of a battery gives several advantages too.&lt;br /&gt;No battery to die on you, which is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;(I have a different Norelco model with a battery that&#x27;s not great. It shaves well but theres no battery meter of any kind, and if you&#x27;re about to leave the house and you&#x27;re shaving last minute and the battery dies (we&#x27;ve all been there before) then you&#x27;re just screwed. Because that shaver, if the battery dies, will not work EVEN WHEN PLUGGED IN. You have to just wait until it&#x27;s charged, to use it, which could be hours. Crappy designing on Norelco&#x27;s part there. They should have made all shavers able to run on the power from the outlet while plugged in)&lt;br /&gt;But this shaver is great, no battery to die or go bad over time.&lt;br /&gt;And it&#x27;s also more than powerful enough, because it uses power straight from the wall.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also very light, because of the lack of a battery.&lt;br /&gt;Shaves well too, on par with other Norelco shavers that cost twice as much. Pretty close shave, comfortable, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I like this shaver a lot. If you do not specifically need a shaver with a battery, get this.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product but not rechargable, need to use the cord when shaving. Light weight is the good thing.</li>
    <li> IHAVE BEEN SHAVING WITH A BLADE FOR OVER 40 YEARS ,THIS BABY ON THE FIRST TIME GAVE ME A CLOSE CLEAN SHAVE,WILL NEVER GO BACK TO A BLADE,MY GOT A LITTLE RED BUT IN TIME IM SURE THAT WILL IN. ALL I HAVE TO SAY IT WORKS GREAT</li>
    <li> I bought this last year for my husband and we have had no problems with it.  It was a great Black Friday price and works just as well as the more expensive models. At least in his opinion it does, and he has several of those more expensive brands sitting on a shelf, not working.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of buying an electric razor for fear that it wouldn&#x27;t deliver a smooth shave.  This shaver does an awesome job.  I been using it now for 3 weeks, love it.  No more facial nicks, cuts, or shaving cream.  It gives a smooth shave and for the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> Since this is my first Shaver, no comparison. Based on my experience, it is good at this price (maybe I am not picky.). But it is inconvenient since I have to plug in all the time to get power, I though it was using recharging power before I bought it. Anyway, still a good product.</li>
    <li> I bought the Philips Norelco 6940LC to replace a similiar Norelco triple headed razor which I destroyed by accidently plugging it into a poorly marked 220V outlet while I was out of the country.  The 6940LC can be used with either 110 or 220V, shaves as well as the old razor, and is considerably quieter.  A good deal for the price and it was delivered within less than a week.</li>
    <li> A feature of electric shavers that razors do not have is that they will lift hairs out of their follicles to cut the hairs, resulting in a hair cut short enough that it is below the skin layer afterwards (Lift and Cut feature is what it is called for Norelcos). If done right, an electric razor can offer a closer shave than a razor, but you will lose skin due to its use (obviously). I have to say my new 6940LC offers an incredible shave for a bargain price; compared to my previous use of Gillette Fusion razors, the Norelco 6940LC offers a much easier and closer shave. Getting the sides of the chin with a razor is hard as hell, but the 6940LC takes care out that easily. Make sure your facial hair area has been warmed with hot water (such as after a shower) to relax the skin and hair follices, shave with the 6940LC, throw some cold water on your face so that the skin and follicles contract, and voila. Super-duper shave that is as good or better than a razor. Make sure you clean your blades regularly with some shaver lubricant (such as Remington Shaver Saver), and you will get an awesome shave every time. One day I hope to get a premium electric shaver (such as the Braun 790cc Pulsonic), but this is awesome for the price. Plus, you will not have any problems with batteries or charges because it is a wall plug shaver. No batteries, no problem, no facial hair!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco shavers for years and they seem to get better all the time but I resent the fact that new heads cost very nearly as much as a new shaver and, in recent years, the shavers themselves seem to wear out faster than the heads.</li>
    <li> very good razor for the money ,much better deal than the local big box store ---mart.</li>
    <li> Best shaver I have ever used. Been using electric shavers since 1962. Super close shave, extra quiet motor, quick and easy to use. Old fashioned corded unit-just what I want. Great buy too!</li>
    <li> Purchased this very basic simple design razor with coiled removable cord through Amazon. It replaces an older model of the same  basic design by Norelco only because I could purchase a newer model for about the same price of the replaceable heads. Incidentally the heads are the same as on the old model. The trimmer works good enough for me. I was amazed to discover that this new one is very quiet in comparison to the old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 CON: The coiled cord is a removable power cord that keeps coming out of the razor. Frustrating sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;This is one of many items that I have purchased from Amazon.com online.</li>
    <li> This is the third electric shaver I have owned. The first was bought too many year ago, it was a Norelco, that lasted forever. The second one was a Remington rotary. The battery died after a year. The problem with the Remington, is that the charger can be \\&quot;almost\\&quot; plugged in backwards. It makes enough contact to try to change the battery with the wrong polarity. Now the thing does not start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked that this one because it does not have a battery. My experience with batteries, is they wear out first. Then you have to use it as a corded shaver anyway. More on that in a second. The shave from this razor is the best I have had from an electric razor. Those of you used to blades may complain, but this does nearly as good, with less irritation of my face. I admit to disliking blades for most of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I have had with this razor, is that the cord sometimes pulls out when I am shaving. Since there is no battery, it stops at that point. The old razors that I had, at least had a weak battery that would keep it running for a few minutes without the cord. Still, I am happy to be without the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t shave in the shower, and this razor can NOT be used in the shower. Some battery powered ones can be. I prefer to shave in front of the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROs&lt;br /&gt;  - Very good shave&lt;br /&gt;  - light weight&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONs&lt;br /&gt;  - No battery to run without power (this is by design. If you want a batter, buy a different model)&lt;br /&gt;  - The on/off switch is a little tight. But then it is still new. (about a month now)</li>
    <li> Very smooth shave.  I experienced no break-in period.  Clipper works great.  Both operate very quietly compared to other shavers I have owned.  I always shave in the bathroom with an electric outlet, so the fact it has no battery is no loss to me.  You can pay lots more for some bells and whistles, but why?  This shaver is all you need.</li>
    <li> Razor cuts well but feels cheap, not like the old electric razors from Narelco.  Money would probably been better spent on my old Norelco for a new head, if I could find one.</li>
    <li> Worked fine at first, then I realized the shaver has to be plugged in to operate (no battery pack included and no way to add one).  Now it has ALREADY begun to stop trimming effectively....don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> I do not use this razor except when away from home, but it works just fine.&lt;br /&gt;I replaced a Norelco rechargable with this item.  The rpm is quite a bit lower&lt;br /&gt;and I was afraid it would not do the job.  It does, and for the money a good deal.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it. He uses it every single day. He says it&#x27;s been the best gift I have ever bought him :)</li>
    <li> This replacement blade unit fits my Norelco shaver perfectly.  Replacing the heads was long overdue so I was astonished at how much better the shaver performed.</li>
    <li> Its a good product, but does not work without power cord... Thats make very inconfortable to use.</li>
    <li> This unit replaced an older one of the same model that was dull. Although I can tell the difference, I still need several passes to get all the hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used norelco razor&#x27;s for many years now, and have always been satisfied except for this one which is cheaply built and does a poor job of shaving.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Boyfriend not realizing he never uses them because his skin is sensitive and gets rashes by electric shavers. He ended up testing it out and he has been using for over six months now with no irritation. I would recommend this for guys with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this low cost shaver for my summer cottage and use it sparingly. I only used it 4 times but each time the shave was clean and quick. In fact I used it two days in a row with a short beard growth and used it after not shaving for three days with a much longer beard growth and in each instance the Norelco did a great job. I use a braun 8990 on a daily basis so I&#x27;m familiar with shaving with an electric razor and the Norelco has done the job for me.</li>
    <li> After my I accidentally spilled water on my old, faithful Norelco 985RX, the battery would spontaneously discharge and eventually wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge. I could not use it even when it was plugged in. I will try my hand at changing the battery sometime soon, and if I can get it to work again, I&#x27;ll leave it at work. I already had the battery changed in 2004 at a cost of about $30. I contacted Norelco about sending it to a service center, but with the cost of shipping, parts, labor, it would be more expensive than buying a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot on another shaver, and I thought about forgoing a rechargeable razor. I don&#x27;t want to deal with the replacing a battery every few years. I don&#x27;t travel much, and even when I do, I have access to an outlet. I saw an ad for Black Friday in which K-mart was selling this model for $24.99. I checked Amazon and it was the same price w/ free shipping (with a total purchase of &gt; $25 for Super Savers) and no tax. I didn&#x27;t have to leave the house and fight the crowds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the razor, and compared to the 985RX and another older Norelco, this felt very light and plasticky, almost like a toy. The 985RX felt hefty and solid. It was made in Holland, unlike this one made in China. I don&#x27;t grow much of a beard, and after trying it out, it did give me a good shave, comparable to my previous razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t have all the bells and whistles. The 985RX had an LCD display showing the minutes left. The 6940 doesn&#x27;t have the fancy look or the latest Norelco shaving technology. However, for me, it gives me a good, clean shave. It&#x27;s quiet, and I can complete my shave in &amp;lt; 1 minute. It would be nice to be able to rinse under the tap to clean it, but it isn&#x27;t a a deal breaker. I agree with other reviewers in that the cord is a little short, but for me, this isn&#x27;t a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this seems to be a good product, and Amazon had a great price.</li>
    <li> Have had the Norelco for over a month now.  Works fine.  Probably not the best razor out there but a great value for the price.  It does what it is supposed to and I have had no problems with it thus far.  When I first turned it on, I was surprised at how quiet it is.  I thought it was not working or something but as I said before, it does its job quite well.  I would buy another one.</li>
    <li> Philips Norelco has this simple, electric cord, non-rechargeable high quality shaver at a terrific price.  For the things I don’t need, this is the perfect shaver for me.  I need the three floating head type shaver.  Single foil electric razors don’t cut my whiskers very well.  I’ve only had good results with a 3 head shaver, and this is a great deal on a high quality shaver.</li>
    <li> This is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever had!  I&#x27;ve had it since November 3rd and it is working good.  It gives me the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
    <li> This shaver was perfect for me:&lt;br /&gt;1. It plugs in the wall, which is the only way I ever use an electric shaver.  (The power cord is included, and is detachable.)&lt;br /&gt;2. I don&#x27;t have to worry about the batteries&#x27; dying.  It doesn&#x27;t have batteries.&lt;br /&gt;3. It is *very* quiet.&lt;br /&gt;4. It shaves really, really well, much better than any other electric razor I have ever owned (including Norelcos).  (I have tough, bristle-brush-like facial hair.)&lt;br /&gt;5.  It is not immersible in water.  I never used that feature anyway.  (It has a small, tasteful decal on the back to remind me not to immerse it in water.)&lt;br /&gt;6.  It was less expensive than the replacement blades for my old Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;7.  It did not come with a case.  I never used the cases on my other Norelcos. (They just took up room in a drawer.)&lt;br /&gt;8.  It comes with a plastic cap to put over the shaving head, great when throwing it in a suitcase.&lt;br /&gt;9.  It comes with a small brush for cleaning the inside of the shaving head.&lt;br /&gt;10.  It comes with a small paper manual, but I figured it all out in about 10 seconds without reading the manual.&lt;br /&gt;11.  It comes with a simple pop-up sideburn trimmer, that is easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;12.  It has an attractive blue and black design.&lt;br /&gt;13.  All of its packaging (paper and plastic) was recyclable at my local recycling center.&lt;br /&gt;14.  I ordered it with free Amazon Super Saver shipping.&lt;br /&gt;I really like it.</li>
    <li> This machine is not working. not shave anything just vibrates. I do not recommend. This product is a scam.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco electric shavers for all my life, and while the rechargeable ones are nice, in time, I&#x27;ve found them not to hold their charge, and then it&#x27;s more frustrating for me, than just plugging it in each day.  As such, I&#x27;ve been buying corded Norelco shavers for years, and I like the triple-head, floating units, like this one, the [[ASIN:B001AJ6QNA Philips Norelco 6940 Reflex Action Men&#x27;s Shaving System]].  I bought this not because my old unit died, but it was as cheap to get a new shaver, than it was to get a set of new blades for my old one.  If you shop in retail stores, that might not be true, but find a Norelco shaver that is like you have now, or similar, and watch it online for a few weeks or so, and when it&#x27;s cheaper than a set of new blades, jump on the new one.  That&#x27;s what I do!  I find that I can go about 12 months between replacements.  They still work ok, but they don&#x27;t cut as nice, as comfortably, as a new set of sharp blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why not 5 stars for this shaver, the 6940?  I feel that the motor might not be as fast as the one I used to have, and I think (just a guess\\&quot; that if the motor went a little faster, I could finish the job faster each day.  Who ones, maybe the quiet sound of this shaver is masking the speed of it.  It&#x27;s quieter than my old one, so that&#x27;s nice, but is it as fast?</li>
    <li> Very good product for the price, no need for anything fancier and more expensive. The cord needs to be longer although...</li>
    <li> This product gave me the closest shave ive ever had in my life, After years of weekly trips to the barber i finally found a at home product that works great. I have never used a wet razer to shave because of fear of razor bumps so this was my only option. Not only was the product affordable and super quiet there was no skin irritation after using. I opted for the battery-less model because i heard the product was of no use after the battery died. I have no problem with the corded version as i doubt ill be shaving anywhere that doesnt have an electric outlet.</li>
    <li> I started using my 6940LC a couple of weeks ago. It works fine, so far. And it is realy worth the money I paid buying it on Amazon.com (~$28). [[ASIN:B001AJ6QNA Philips Norelco 6940 Reflex Action Men&#x27;s Shaving System]]</li>
    <li> Bought this shaver specifically because it ran off of 120vac. Don&#x27;t like the idea of having to go through the hassle of replacing the NiCad batteries or the whole shaver simply because the batteries have gone bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Found the quality of shave on par with previously owned Norelco shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two reasons why the product is given only a four star rating are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Unlike other electric shavers THIS SHAVER CANNOT BE CLEANED UNDER&lt;br /&gt;  RUNNING WATER. One must use a small brush(brush is provided)to clean the&lt;br /&gt;  shaver head when needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Found the power cord provided to be too short. Fortunately was able to use a&lt;br /&gt;  power cord from a previously owned Norelco shaver to solve this problem.</li>
    <li> This is a decent razor. It sounds like it does not have enough power but it does give a decent shave. You have to go slow with it but other than that it is okay.</li>
    <li> My institutionalized brother was so pleased with this shaver as a gift, that the most pleasant picture of him in forty years was taken with him holding it. This picture was sent by his care-giver to my mother and so pleased her, that the blow of his death 2 days later was amazingly and wonderfully ameliorated for her ... and therefore for me since I actually sent it in her name. After a tortuous life, he died in his sleep. Shave in Peace Little Brother. Thanks Phillips Norelco ... you work in mysterious ways.</li>
    <li> My fault for not reading closer, but speaking of closer.. It&#x27;s an OK shaver but after a weeks worth of use, I&#x27;m going back to the blade and leaving this in my RV. It&#x27;s very quiet and extremely lightweight so it will be perfect for RVing. My biggest complaint is that it is not good for sculpting around my mustache, but is any electric razor good for that?</li>
    <li> i have used this shaver almost every day. it seems to be fine, however i wish it had a little bit more power. but for the price, ya can&#x27;t beat it!!!!</li>
    <li> This shaver did not shave thick facial hair well. My son has used other Norelco shavers in same price category without problems.</li>
    <li> Great shaver - good price and gives a good, close shave. Yes, it has a cord but I don&#x27;t care because I shave next to an outlet anyway. Only issue I have is the cord has stretch out so it&#x27;s not wound in tight coiled loops anymore but it still works fine.</li>
    <li> this is my first electric shaver designed to cut close.  It takes quite a while to get a clean shave, requiring that you go over the same spot many times.  the more frequently you shave the less of an issues it is, as if you miss a hair today, you&#x27;ll probably get it tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like to shave every few days, you can easily get to the point where your hair is too long for the main rotary blades to cut it.  I was surprised by how quickly this occurred.  After your hair is about 1/16\\&quot; long, you must use the trimmer option, which means you have to shave your face twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver claimed to have a 45 day return policy, but the company makes you jump through some hoops, tells you they&#x27;re going to keep your money for an unduly long period of time, so I just kept the shaver that I feel like is overpriced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could do it again, I&#x27;d get one of the cheaper wahl shavers.  To me an easy shave is more important than a perfectly clean shave.  This shaver does neither particularly well, but also neither horribly.</li>
    <li> seems cheaply made and the head moves around a lot when you try to use it. If you really want an electric shaver pay a bit more and get a higher quality one.</li>
    <li> This is a good deal. A quality shave, with little cleanup time. No battery to worry about. the price is right. Shave and forget.</li>
    <li> Nothing can beat not having failed batteries. You just plug it and it gives the same power each time. I have been using it for the past three years and i am sure the batteries would have died by now in other pieces.  This is a simple yet extremely functional piece and is very useful for travel. You can take it in your hand luggage (with razors you need to check in your luggage and then worry about buying it at your destination)</li>
    <li> After several Norelco shavers, and numerous sets of heads, this is the most pleasing. Its the right shape, and runs more quietly than the previous models. After a month using it, I don&#x27;t see any downside. I saw some complaints about the cord being too short, but the cord on this one is the same as the last 3 shavers I have had. Its a coiled cord and easily stretches 5 feet. The sideburn cutter is better than the last model I had, with finer cutting notches. As I said, this is the quietest one I have had. It cuts close and doesn&#x27;t irritate my face. I am happy with this one.</li>
    <li> I have been a Norelco fan for many years. I have had an older version of the corded/cordless models, and they stink!  I bought the 6940 model, and it works just great!  I don&#x27;t want a model that has to be recharged, and eventually the battery runs down, and can&#x27;t be charged again.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on the more expensive models.  They won&#x27;t give you any better shave than the 6940.  The 6940 gives me a close shave, and didn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg, and I don&#x27;t have to recharge it, just plug it in.  The cord is just fine.  I shave in front of a merror. I don&#x27;t shave when I&#x27;m in the shower, and I&#x27;m not on the go so much that I can&#x27;t find a place to plug my shaver in.</li>
    <li> I purchased and have been using the Philips Norelco 6940 for some time now.  The reason I went with Philips Norelco is because I have another Norelco, which I still use on occasion. My older model is the Norelco 4401LC.  Although it still works, and has been going strong for probably 10+ years, I fear it might go out at any time, so better to be safe than sorry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although, I like the 6940, it just doesn&#x27;t seem to have the same cutting power as my older model, the 4401LC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;much quieter than my older model&lt;br /&gt;corded so I don&#x27;t have to worry about charging the batteries (this may be a con for some people, but I prefer it)&lt;br /&gt;price (bought it for less than 40 clams)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutral:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cut (average cut, but gets the job done&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;none&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you are in the market for a corded electric shaver, the Philips Norleco 6940 is a good buy.</li>
    <li> As a happy long-time Norelco user, I had no qualms about purchasing this razor. MISTAKE!! The freakin&#x27; electric cord absolutely WILL NOT stay connected with the razor. You&#x27;ll find yourself shaving with 2 hands--you&#x27;ll need one hand to keep the cord attached to the razor. I&#x27;m shocked that Philips put their name on this shoddy piece of !@$#@!&lt;br /&gt;And if they think I&#x27;m willing to upgrade to one of their cordless razors, they&#x27;ve got another think coming.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used an electric razor in 20 years, but decided to get one. My blade razor is the Gillette Mach 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just got the Norelco 6940 and shaved with it. Not as close as the blade, but not bad; also very smooth and comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do wish they had included a case for the thing, like they did back in the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good buy, based on first use. Durability remains to be seen</li>
    <li> This is my third (fourth?) Norelco corded shaver and it is very good for only 30&#x27;something dollars. Yes, it is not \\&quot;fancy looking\\&quot; and it does not have bells and whistles, BUT what is does is, last for many years UNLIKE the \\&quot;fancy looking\\&quot; rechargeable Norelco shavers. The previous model [6423 Reflex Plus, HQ55+] of this one, which I bought at Walmart five years ago for about $35.00, is still going strong AND I haven&#x27;t replace the blades. It is now in my travel bag. I share the same shaver with my brother and still NO problem with the blades. The run down:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair - thick and course / His hair - fine and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco 6940 Reflex Action and 6423 Reflex Plus - both of them shave closely without any ingrown hair, bumps, or cuts [NO need to replace the blades].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco 6940 Pros - shaves a bit closer than 6423, very quiet, lighter, and you never have to replace it after 2 years of use, unlike the rechargeable ones that cost [$$$$] way more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco 6940 Cons - though it shaves closer, it is a bit slow. Therefore, you may have to focus more on certain areas and go over it twice, which DOESN&#x27;T more time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guys, don&#x27;t buy into fancy ads and fake promises, get a shaver that is corded and one that will last for more than 2-3 years. And it doesn&#x27;t have to cost $90 to $200.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco razors for decades-this one does what&#x27;s needed-but the cord falls out continuosly !!  Even when the cord isn&#x27;t stretched !! This is a recent problem with Norelco corded razors [I&#x27;ve owned a least 8]-my guess is they want you to buy one of their more expensive rechargeables.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve waited about 6 months to write a review, because IMO you can&#x27;t judge an electric shaver until that amount of time has gone by (well you can, if the thing just doesn&#x27;t work at all from day one, but if it does, you have to see how long it will last).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with this shaver! No, it will not give you as close a shave as a good blade or a $200 shaver, but it gives a damn good shave and the price can&#x27;t be beat. And after 6 months, it is still shaving as good as on day one, important because replacement heads are as expensive as the shaver itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One drawback: This shaver has poor shavings &#x27;ventilation&#x27;. Your shaved hairs will accumulate very quickly inside the head. I recommend removing the screens and brushing the blades every 3-4 shaves, otherwise the heads get clogged and shaving closeness diminishes. This sounds onerous but it isn&#x27;t, since thanks to the design of the head, it is extremely easy and quick to do. Not a hassle at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, this is CRITICAL: On the inside of each screen, there is a center dimple where the blade fits. Hairs will gradually wrap themselves around this dimple and they are very hard to see. When this happens, the shaver will work BARELY AT ALL, as the wrapped-around hairs will reduce blade-spin. After about a month, i came THIS CLOSE to throwing the shaver out, until i realized what was happening. It took about 2 seconds to twirl-off the hairs, and then the shaver worked fine.</li>
    <li> Five stars for sure, if not for the narrow and slippery handle!&lt;br /&gt;This corded shaver is QUIET! Much quieter than my older shavers. It also cuts closely in one pass. This performance was a real surpise. Also, a corded shaver is a lot less hassle!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;If it breaks today, I&#x27;ll order another immediately!</li>
    <li> This shaver is just what I have been searching for.  First, lets clarify what it is not.  It&#x27;s not a over hyped, gadget filled, rechargable overpriced piece of crap like most others that I have bought.  Now that that&#x27;s out of the way, this shaver does what it is supposed to do, it shaves.  I like the fact that I do not have to fool around recharging a battery.  I just plug it in and shave.  It gives me a good shave every day.  The cutting heads did seem to take a few shaves to break in.  It got smoother after the first few shaves.  I do not care for the coil cords compared to the shavers of yesteryear, but I&#x27;m really dating myself with that statement.  I read other reviews about the cord pulling out.  I put a little adhesive on the outside part of the plug where it goes into the shaver when I first got it and let it dry overnight.  I have no problem with the cord pulling out.  It fit pretty tightly anyway and I doubt I would have had an issue unless it was stretched way out.</li>
    <li> Before I say anything else, let me just say that I have a curse when it comes to electronics. I don&#x27;t have to touch them, they just stop working around me. It&#x27;s not from any sort of abuse. Fans go out within a week. Heaters blow every fuse in the house. Watches stop working, hair dryers explode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t give this razor one star. It can&#x27;t help it. It&#x27;s just me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the same, one blade stopped working within a week of use. I returned it, but there were no more of this kind. Ended up with a cheaper Norelco, and it just can&#x27;t cut it. (Pun not intended.) I really wish this one still worked, as it gave a nice, clean shave, and cleanup was easier than my last electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, if you&#x27;ll excuse me, I think my computer is frying.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I wanted.  I had no need for a cordless model.  It&#x27;s a lot like my previous shaver, which lasted so many years that I can&#x27;t remember when I bought it, and although I liked it, I was pleased to see that the design had actually been improved.  This one is even better than my old one was when the old one was new.</li>
    <li> Thanks Steven, for your review where you mentioned how critical it is to clean the inside of the screen that holds the shaving heads. When you do it, it makes a world of difference. Anyone who owns this shaver, or probably any Norelco shaver should do this on a regular basis. It&#x27;s quick and easy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using corded Norelco shavers for about 40 years.  Each one seems to last me about 10 years before I decide that the blades are too dull.  I prefer buying a new one for around $35 to replacing the blades for about the same amount.  My new one seems to be like all the others.  It shaves close, never needs a new battery, and the pop-up trimmer works great.</li>
    <li> The switch on my husbands&#x27; 20-yr old Norelco started acting up, so, he figured it was time for a new one. He decided on this model because it&#x27;s a Norelco, is corded, has flexible heads, and had many good reviews. We rec&#x27;d it yesterday and he was pleasantly surprised by how quiet it is as well. So far, he is happy with this product. If it lasts half as long as it&#x27;s predecessor, it will have been a steal.</li>
    <li> It does not have the battery in it and one has to&lt;br /&gt;add an electric cord in order to use it conveniently.&lt;br /&gt;Pretty much wasted my money on this purchase</li>
    <li> I bought this after my cordless Norelco broke and I realized that I very rarely used it off of the cord anyways due to the lower blade speeds. This one shaves just as well as my cordless Norelco and cost not too much more than a set of replacement blades. Overall I am satisfied with the product as it has met all of my expectations for a shaver of this price. Some features however are absent on this one, such as the ability to clean with running water and the head doesn&#x27;t hinge up like on some other models, it instead must be taken completely off.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Norelco for many years but my old one was about to give up.  It sounded like it was about to throw a rod or something, so I started to shop for the cheapest one I could find.  I believe this one was it.  I wasn&#x27;t sure what I expected with this one, but when I first lit it off and saw how quiet it was I was a little doubtful.  Now that I am retired I don&#x27;t shave but every few days and wasn&#x27;t sure it would make it through.  Well, no fears there.  This is a great shaver.  It is so much improved over my last Norelco I&#x27;m sorry I made the other one last as long as I did.  This one is fast, there&#x27;s no burn, and it gives a super close shave.  I can&#x27;t imagine what you would get for the big bucks if you get this much for their least expensive shaver.  Maybe someone switched them at birth.</li>
    <li> he hates to shave but he uses this and likes it well because it works well lol nice and smooth :] i love it too</li>
    <li> I like the price on the action men&#x27;s shaving system.  I did not read all of the buying guide.  I wanted to get a cordless one, but this one works fine</li>
    <li> I just packed this shaver up to return to Amazon. Thank goodness the return process is very easy. USPS delivered the shaver this morning. I opened the box, plugged the cord into the shaver, and plugged the AC cord into an electric outlet. Nothing happened! It was absolutely  D.O.A. I removed the heads and turned the shaver on and, as I might have expected, the motor ran perfectly. Attach the heads and nothing. The heads were frozen. I shook the heads a bit; even said a silent prayer to the shaver gods, but it was to no avail. I really want a corded shaver. I paid $129.00 for a Panasonic wet/dry cordless a few years ago and it served me well, until the rechargeable battery got weak, then I felt I was using an Epilady, ripping the whiskers from my face. This time I wanted an AC powered, corded shaver, that always has full power. I won&#x27;t try again with this Norelco 6940. I really hate returning anything; it&#x27;s such a pain, and what if Amazon sends me another Norelco clinker? There&#x27;s got to be another corded shaver; not Norelco. At least, I hope so.</li>
    <li> Razor seems a little flimsy and with a \\&quot;cut the corners\\&quot; feel.  But you get what you pay for, and the razor is relatively inexpensive.  Buy one a year as a disposable.</li>
    <li> This is my fourth Norelco razor. My last one was cordless. I replaced the battery roughly nine months ago. The battery is going bad again. With Norelco rotary razors, if the heads do not spin fast enough, you do not get a good shave. I was thrilled to be able to buy a corded razor. No batteries and no worrying about recharging and no worries about batteries going bad. This is a good no frills electric razor that will give most people a close comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift for my 14 year old son.  Wonderful price for a great product.  For his first electric razor, this product didn&#x27;t break the bank.  He loves it.</li>
    <li> I guess I was expecting this thing to actually shave my face, but instead it justs makes a noise and doesn&#x27;t do much.  If you push real hard, it eventually will start shaving, but its definitely not a good product if you&#x27;re looking for a good shave or even just something quick to use on those mornings that you&#x27;re late.  I would save the money and put it towards a much better razor.</li>
    <li> I think it is almost the worse of the latest Norelco shavers I have purchased with the exception of the battery operated version which was so bad I gave it away.&lt;br /&gt;My 715RL and another one almost the same (725RL I think) are far superior to any others I have purchased and owned.&lt;br /&gt;From now on as long as I can purchase blades (heads) for those two I will and never buy another Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frank J. Kormos</li>
    <li> Never realized my working 25 year old Norelco was so lame until I replaced it.  It was fortunate that I left my old one in the summer home at NC; tried the economical model and was tremendously surprised by the comfort and effectiveness ....and quick, too!&lt;br /&gt;Oh, The Lady says I&#x27;m squeeky clean now - Yep!</li>
    <li> I like this razor because it gives a very close shave and it extreamly easy to use, the only reason i couldnt give it 5 stars is because it tends to hurt even if i&#x27;m barely pushing, and sometimes pinches the skin which is horrible. Other than that one complaint i&#x27;m very happy with this and I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a close shave electric razor for a cheap price</li>
    <li> This corded Norelco was under $20 when I bought it and shaved as close as the ones costing three times as much.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as all my electric shavers had a battery that could be charged and the problem was after a few years between 3-5 yrs they won&#x27;t hold the charge and the battery was not easlily replacable. I was therefore looking for electric shaver which can only be plugged in. I saw this product which was reasonably priced and had good reviews! I therefore decided to give it a try and so far in my about 3 months of owenership when I have used it infrequently ,it has delivered. The shave is close and the case is small and hence easily portable. I think it is a great value for the money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HSP</li>
    <li> Really like the quiet shave, compared to the Remington&#x27;s I have had in the past. Closer shave!  The pop-up trimmer works great to cut the grey hairs that stand up on the top of my head!  Got tired of having to constantly charge the other shaver. So over-all very satisfied with this Philips Norelco 6940.  If the replacement heads cost too much, I will just purchase a new one at this price!  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Philips Norelco 6940 Reflex Action Men&#x27;s Shaving System is really good way for shaving. It&#x27;s  most comfortable and cheapest shaver I have ever met :)</li>
    <li> I was looking for a low cost razor. I have owned Norelco&#x27;s and had good luck, but they were much more expensive moodels and were rechargeable. I gambled and bought this unit. It shaves as well as any razor I have ever had. You do have to stay buy the power outlet (cannot walk around) but it shaves great and was inexpensive. I would recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> I replaced an older Norelco with this one and it is just great. No bells or whistles just a great shave</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift and feel I can&#x27;t truly evaluate it, but the person&lt;br /&gt;I bought it for finds it lacking....But they find nearly everything lacking.</li>
    <li> This product provides a relatively smooth shave with little discomfort. Since it plugs directly into the wall and does not charge, I never have to wait for it to finish charging in order to shave. Keeps me on time and not in a worry whether I&#x27;ll be able to shave all of my facial hair or half of it before work each day. This is immensely comforting to me. I no longer live in fear of how my shaver will treat me! :)</li>
    <li> I used the Norelco 6423LC Reflex for many years until the connector to the cord started shorting out. In the market for a reasonably-priced replacement, I found the 6940 Reflex to work just as well. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks now, and it provides a quick, smooth shave, no better or worse than the old Reflex, though this new model is quieter. I agree with the other reviews that the power cord is a bit too short, so you may want to use your old Reflex&#x27;s cord. Also, this does not come with a carrying pouch/case, so hold on to your old one. I have had no problems with the cord falling out of the shaver, as some others have. A reminder to anyone who hasn&#x27;t already read many of the other reviews here: This is NOT battery-powered, it&#x27;s corded only.</li>
    <li> I wanted a razor to use in our car, which has an electric socket, while my wife drives.  I appreciate the tip in a prior Amazon review that razor batteries die after a couple years and take their razors down with them.  This razor avoids that problem as it has no battery, which is perfect for me.  It does a great job of shaving.  I give it 4 stars and not 5, because the cord should be longer.</li>
    <li> This is my third Norelco shaver with the triple head, the third in 26 years.  To say the quality is very good is an understatement.  This new unit is far quieter and much smoother shaving than previous units.  Had I known that the 6940 was this good, I wouldn&#x27;t have waited until my old one finally fell apart to buy this new model.&lt;br /&gt;  The physical design is well done and eye-pleasing and the shaving heads seem to shave better than the old model.  If you can use a plug-in shaver, I highly recommend this unit.</li>
    <li> I did not realize how bad the shave from my old shaver had become until I used the new Norelco.  Much better than I had expected.</li>
    <li> I may add to this review when I have used the shaver a while, especially if I love the shaves, but having just taken it out of the package and quickly tested it out, I am unhappy.  I am a longterm Norelco user, although in recent years I only use an electric shaver on days when I am in a hurry or just need a quick shave late in the day or on a weekend.  I find traditional razors give a closer shave.  But the Norelco I have been using (for 27 years -- is that a record?) finally just stopped and I had to buy another. I didn&#x27;t want to spend much since I don&#x27;t use it all that often and I was not interested in a shaver that needs charging, since  I don&#x27;t want to keep it in a charging position, plus in my bathroom the electric outlet only gives juice when the overhead light is on (not a great design but it really doesn&#x27;t usually bother me). So I opted for a corded razor, which is cheaper and should work fine.  It comes in a packaging unit that you have to hammer at with a sharp point to open, being careful not to cut yourself on the sharp edges of the package after you smash it to get at the razor.  My old razor had  a nice, inexpensive case of molded plastic that I kept it in very neatly all these years.  This one has nothing.  Of course, this one doesn&#x27;t fit into the old case either, so I had to go find another small soft case that would fit the razor, cord, and brush so they do not get separated or snarled with something else. I also noticed the plastic cover on the razor head does not seem as sturdy as the old one.  Worst of all, the cord is about ten inches shorter than my old one and only stretches to where I need it by pulling it tight. PLUS the plug itself is loose in the electric socket and easily falls out.  Luckily, my old cord fit fine, so I am saving them both.  The razor does seem to do the job, but I am not happy about the elision of quality.</li>
    <li> Having used a Norelco for over 25 years, this is great shaver for the price.  Others can cost over $100, but they&#x27;re not the worth double the price in performance.</li>
    <li> First time to use an electric shaver. I though it would be worse, given that this is one of the cheapest on the market. I don&#x27;t know if this applies to all electric shavers, but this is not to be used to get a perfect look. It can only be of use if u need to get ride of the dirty look before going to a casual meeting or to the gym. Not to be used if you&#x27;re gonna meet an important person. Overall i don&#x27;t regret buying it, and i use it quite often, but for me its not a substitution for the regular blade.</li>
    <li> Bought the product from Amazon.com seeing all the reviews about the product and since it was on sale and I got for a good price....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  It is essentially a very basic model of the Norelco family of triple rotary shavers. Has no rechargeable battery and works while plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;  The first few shaves irritated as this was my first electric razor. However, in spite of continuous usage for 3 weeks, as recommended in the manual, I did not get a smooth/close and irritation free shave. In addition one of the blades started getting hot and the shave was not close enough. I contacted Philips and their excellent customer care people sent me a replacement blades within 2 days and after replacing the new blades I get a pretty close/smooth shave although the irritation of my skin is yet to disappear completely.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Overall a decent product to start off with electric shaving.</li>
    <li> I usually replace these things every two years...........this new one, obtained within a week by Amazon, actually works better than the older ones...closer shave, better flexibility.  I hope it lasts two years...........</li>
    <li> I would expect something that says it is a corded razor, to have a cord that does not come loose from the unit. As this has a very short cord it comes out all the time. If you are going to make a corded razor then wire the cord straight into the unit, so we will not have to be annoyed by this \\&quot;feature\\&quot;. Oh and the motor is not as strong as my 15 year old razor, and it still runs. Very disappointed in this item.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start off by saying I have an incredibly tough beard and considered an electric razor a shot in the dark.  However, for the price of this electric I thought I would at least give it a try.  I hate shaving so I pleasantly excused myself from the task for three days in the name of solid experimental procedure.  The shaver came in the mail today and I went to town on a quarter inch of scruff.  The results were no less than astounding.  This was not a quick experience, but in under 10 minutes I accomplished a comparable job to a blade with almost none of the irritation I&#x27;ve become so familiar with.  Day 1 and I am absolutely sold.  I have to think that any negative reviews of this product are the result of a defective unit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been curious about electric razors and had the opportunity to pick this one up sale.  I was so impressed with this razor&#x27;s closeness and ease of use that I purchased two other razors (one rotary and one foil) with all the bells and whistles (battery, self cleaning, wet/dry, etc).  This razor, which is 1/4 of the cost, ridiculously outperformed the other two in closeness!  In fact, I used this razor to shave over what the other two left behind. I even did a \\&quot;5 o&#x27;clock\\&quot; shadow test versus a blade and to my surprise (and against all conventional thinking) this electric razor won.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, I ACTUALLY LOOK FORWARD to shaving.  No more messy preparation needed for manual shaving.  Just 5 minutes daily with this electric razor and your done.  That it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will soon pick-up the equivalent model for this razor in it&#x27;s battery, wet/dry form (The 7340).</li>
    <li> you can not beat this razor for the price.  It is corded which is great seems to have move power than non corded. Easy and does a great job.</li>
    <li> After much searching on Amazon and \\&quot;other\\&quot; internet searches this is the lowest priced electric shaver that does NOT have a battery. I bought it because my 20 year old Remington is NFG (Nolonger Functionally Good). I shave with a blade most of the time and only use the electric when travelling so as not to carry a can of shaving cream. A battery powered unit&#x27;s battery would deteriorate quickly if it is not used regularly (daily?).</li>
    <li> This razor has gone up in price (It was $27.88 when I received mine), but I still would view it as a decent deal.  In 2.5 years I haven&#x27;t needed any replacement parts, and I do only minimal maintenance--shake out the hair every few days, brush the cutters maybe once a month, soak them less frequently.  I found the shave to be comfortable immediately upon switching from my old Braun.  The only irritant, which does not seem to be universal with this model, is that the cord tends to fall out with minimal tugs or even just gravity (and has from the beginning).  The cord is rather short, so I have mine on an extension cord, but even holding up the cord with the other hand is not always adequate to keep the cord in the shaver.  I&#x27;m willing to accept that inconvenience given that everything else is quite appealing.</li>
    <li> It lasted less than 1 year!</li>
    <li> Let me just say I read the reviews and knew exactly what I was getting, and got exactly what I wanted. However, it&#x27;s definitely not for everyone. I&#x27;ve never used another Norelco, but this thing really does cut at the skin. That&#x27;s why the manual says your face has to adapt the the razor over a whole month or more. It doesn&#x27;t make me bleed, but I can clearly feel the many tiny cuts. The trade off though, is a fast, close, clean shave for $25, and that&#x27;s exactly what I needed. It really just takes a few swipes even when the hairs are grown out a bit and leaves the skin very smooth, albeit in pain. Many reviewers have said it looks cheap and I agree, but it&#x27;s not built cheap. I just throw it in with my clothes when I travel and it does perfectly fine. It has no case because it doesn&#x27;t need one. And on the subject of travel, it takes both 110 and 220V (can never assume about that) and any hotel bathroom will have an outlet right next to the sink. It&#x27;s also easy to clean and has no battery that gets weak when low. Finally, it has a spiraling cord that constantly springs back and that is usually just a bit annoying, but in a loose outlet, it could make the unit useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to get it on sale because it (or another low end Norelco) often is.</li>
    <li> Good little shaver for the price. Very quiet and shaves quickly.  I especially like the fact that it is a cord only with no battery to fail in a couple of years. However, since the shaver head is as expensive as a new shaver you might just as well buy a new unit anyway. It does a nice job on flat open areas but burns my neck where the uneven bumps and grooves are.</li>
    <li> An excellent razor.  I have had at least four Norelco razors over the last 20 years or more -- both corded and cordless -- and all performed quite well.  I prefer the corded type because the motor doesn&#x27;t depend on the battery condition and the razor lasts a long time.  It&#x27;s almost as economical to buy a new one from Amazon as compared to purchasing a replacement head.  My previous model was also a corded type and lasted about 5 years without any parts replacement.</li>
    <li> I have only owned Norelco shavers; the last one was a more expensive model that yanked the hair out by the roots! Decided for a more basic corded model this time (I don&#x27;t travel so cordless wasn&#x27;t needed) and it is much better. Comfortable shave and easy cleanup.</li>
    <li> Anyone who has ever had a Norelco shaver probably already knows their outstanding value. But this is hands down the best one I&#x27;ve ever used. I don&#x27;t need a \\&quot;system\\&quot; for shaving. If you can&#x27;t clean your shaver yourself, you shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to play with one anyway! No cleaning system, no attachments to clutter up your bathroom, no batteries to maintain... Just plenty of power whenever you need it and a very fast, close shave. I couldn&#x27;t believe it! This thing is like a lawn mower! On a tough 2-day beard, it shaved me in about one minute! And did a very good job! But if you want to waste money and lower your standards, buy something else...:):):)</li>
    <li> Had a minor issue with original shipped item, but seller immediately sent replacement, and all is well.  Decent product for price and excellent customer service.  We are happy.</li>
    <li> Having used Norelcos for a decade, this is pretty much the only style of razor with which I&#x27;m comfortable. However, except right after a re-charge, the battery-powered models just aren&#x27;t powerful enough for my beard -- with them I often have to go over the same spots again and again to get every whisker. I love that this razor has the same amount of juice every time I use it, and it&#x27;s still going strong after a year&#x27;s use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also generally like the design of the Norelco razors -- they&#x27;re easy to clean, they fit in my hand nicely, and I feel like the three-sided surface slides more evenly around the contours of my face than brands that have flat surfaces.</li>
    <li> You know what I like about this shaving system? It&#x27;s that it does not get hot on my skin, which for me was the worst part of shaving with machines. This system does not get as hot as my old system. I like it a lot! And I don&#x27;t mind it does not have batteries. For me it means this will be good for a long time.</li>
    <li> Good value for the price from Amazon.  Shaver is quiet and light.  Does fine job as the blades are still new. Pop-out trimmer works great.</li>
    <li> Great item, inexpensive and worked just fine.  Best of all no batteries to fail.  Only complaint is I wish the cord was permently attached to the end of the razor as it can fall out while you shave.  Solution is I glued it in.</li>
    <li> I had to return mine because the power cord is a poor fit for the razor.  The razor shaved as well as more expensive Norelco shavers which I have owned before.  This razor gave me a reasonably close shave with minimum irritation.  All would have been fine if not for one significant flaw.  The power cord falls out of the bottom of the shaver.  After replacing it into the shaver it then would fall out of the power socket on the wall.  I never was able to get a complete shave without having to replug the cord several times.  This was more than a minor annoyance.  All of the virtues of this otherwise fine product, such as the close shave, excellent trimmer, and easy cleaning, were negated by the inability of a simple power cord to do it&#x27;s job.  I examined the cord carefully and it was properly made and looked perfect. Unfortunately looks are not everything and after over a week of trying to get one shave without the cord failing, I had to return the shaver to Amazon. I still recommend Norelco shavers but not this model.  I suggest a cordless model and I also suggest that buying the least expensive model of any product is not always a smart or economical decision.</li>
    <li> Much Better Than Battery-Powered  Shavers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the cord length to be just fine.  It&#x27;s a coil type cord that stretches out with very little effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did you know that, generally speaking, battery-powered shavers cannot go in your checked baggage when flying?  Of course, this one can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied with all aspects of this shaver, does a good job, runs clean and smoothly. Has a built-in trimmer that works very nicely.</li>
    <li> First of all let me say I applaud this company for making an electric razor that doesn&#x27;t have a battery... who needs a battery to shave??? I shave in front of my mirror 2 feet from a plug in, the last thing I need is something with a battery that will never be used and just end up polluting the planet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunatley thats the only good thing I have to say. Right out of the box the shaving head does not seal correctly... it looks like it is sealed then you start shaving and it pops off after 2 seconds of normal shaving. Put it back on and pops right back off. Besides that the little time I used it, it seemed very underpowered and didn&#x27;t work very good the seconds it was shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sent back to Amazon the next day... BTW AMAZON IS THE BEST!!!!</li>
    <li> Well i needed a supplement shaver, you know one that does not need charging to have at home, while the rechargeable one is in the car. This thing will rip your face off if you are not careful, it has direct power so... And remember, drive safe. NO SHAVING WHILE DRIVING. :)</li>
    <li> This replaced an old cordless Norelco that finally broke, so I&#x27;m comparing it to that and a $9.99 Emerson wet/dry cordless shaver from CVS. The construction isn&#x27;t as solid as the old one; the plastic and metal is thin, on the order of the cheapo Emerson. The flexibility of the shaving heads is much better than my previous Norelco, but the design means it takes longer to clean the unit than it takes to shave; that&#x27;s probably the worst part about the design. The shave was fast and close when new, but with daily use, after a couple of weeks, it&#x27;s progressively less close; no better than the Emerson. The power cord is too short; could be a foot longer. One thing I like is that it&#x27;s very quiet. I find the built in trimmer almost useless. The cost of replacement shaving heads isn&#x27;t worth it; I bought the shaver for about $32 at Walmart, only about 50 cents more than what new heads cost! My first electric shaver was a Norelco and I&#x27;ve used one since, but there&#x27;s nothing that stands out about this one and it sure doesn&#x27;t feel or look as well made as the older ones, so I don&#x27;t expect it to last long. Conclusion: The more I use it, the less satisfied I am.</li>
    <li> I replaced an older Norelco shaver. The new shaver is much quieter and gives an excellent shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve already owned one of these and the saying, \\&quot;if it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it\\&quot; applies here. This is a no nonsense shaver without all the bells and whistles. My last one gave me a great daily shave for about two years. This is much cheaper than a razor and shaving foam. I actually bought two of these, in case they stop making them.</li>
    <li> I bought this Norelco since it was less expensive than the cordless model I purchased 2 years ago. Unfortunately the quality of this shaver is mediocre compared to the cordless model.  I guess you get what you pay for when you buy an electric shaver. The cord connecting the shaver to the power cord is poorly constructed and pulls out of the connection almost every time I use the shaver. The shaving blades are a different design than the cordless model and does a mediocre job of shaving.  It takes me twice as long to shave using this model.  Don&#x27;t buy this model unless you want to spend more time shaving and want to keep re-connecting the power cord to the shaver.</li>
    <li> I have just chosen this shaver to replace the Philips travel shaver which I have used for over 4 years. Philips is really good at producing shavers and I find shaving even easier with this one. The only disadvantage of this shaver is that it has to be used with the cable. But if you decide to use it at home, it doesn&#x27;t matter. Another thing you should notice is the plastic package, it is really difficult to unfold.</li>
    <li> Works good, very quiet, was wondering if it was working. For the price it does a good job, That&#x27;s all folks</li>
    <li> I have used many electric shavers through the years. I bought this one because the price was almost equal to replaceing the heads on the old one. The first time I turned it on I thought this isnt going to be good, it was so quiet that I thought something was wrong. In my years of expeirence with electric shavers, I have never gotten as close of a shave the first pass over my beard. It is the best shaver I have ever used, and highly recommend it. Thanks Phillips/Norelco  tom</li>
    <li> Actually, I am very, very pleased with the 6940 Reflex.  I had purchased Norelco that used a rechargable battery, but after the purchase and reading the literature and speaking with the Norelco customer-service people, I learned that: 1) When the battery dies, it cannot be replaced; we have to discard the razor.  2) Even though there is an electric cord for recharging the battery, when the battery dies one cannot use the cord to shave. And I read on line that so many people were vexed because the battery died within a year of the purchase. And when the battery is still alive, one has to play the game of charging it, and if you keep it on-charge for more than the specific charging time, the battery will be damaged.  So much botheration - just because one wants to shave without a cord. All of these concerns are by-passed simply by plugging in the 6940 and shaving.  There are sockets all over the house.  The action on the 6940 is very good. Very quiet.  Very sharp blades clip off the hair without pulling. Very light-weight in the hand.  Easy to clean.  We have a mini shop-vac in the house and I open up the head of the razor and and in 15 seconds the thing is clean as a whistle.  No brushing. the only thing I would change is the electric cord.  It is coiled, so I have to cope with a small amount of resistance in the cord when shaving.  I have it in mind to call Norelco and ask if they have a straight cord that I can substitute for the coiled one.  I have also considered keeping it stretched out in between shavings until that coiled effect begins to loose some of its resiliency.  But over all, I am delighted with it.  And my wife tried it on her legs and insisted that it is &amp;#34;our&amp;#34; razor. It beats the little electric razor she has been using on her legs hands down.  I should get paid for writing this.  But I am glad to find other people&#x27;s reviews.  So I hope this may be helpful to some of you.</li>
    <li> I am a long time user of the Norelco triple head shaver model #6940 and never had a problem with it.  This shaver is only plug in, so it has no battery, and is therefore very light weight.  I use the Norelco every day at home and had a Braun shaver that I used on vacation.  However after my vacation in July I threw out the Braun and replaced it with another Norelco triple head shaver model #6940 which is much better.</li>
    <li> For the price the razor does a good job, the only complaint I have is with the power connector that connects to the razor.&lt;br /&gt;If Norelco would permanently connect the cord to the razor, I would give it a five star rating.</li>
    <li> This razor worked well for a little over a year and then had to be replaced as it pretty much gave up the ghost. I would have preferred that it lasted a little longer.</li>
    <li> Norelco offers this triple header razor for less than the cost of the replacement blades that I had been looking to buy. You can&#x27;t beat the deal, and like all other norelco razors I&#x27;ve owned, once your skin &#x27;gets used to&#x27; the way these blades cut, you get a reasonably close shave.</li>
    <li> This unit did not cost much, and it mostly sort of works. So am I satisfied? Sure.&lt;br /&gt;Is this a great electric shaver? No. It is a flimsy piece of crap.&lt;br /&gt;I miss my old Remington. The straight blades on the Remington are vastly superior to this stupid triple head design on the Norelco. But the Remington was cordless and the batteries were no longer holding charge and could not be easily replaced. This unit is corded and will not require a battery replacement - which is a good thing. Hopefully this unit is sturdy enough to outlast a set of comparable batteries.</li>
    <li> This razor gives a great shave, just as good as the more expensive models. For this price it cannot be beat.</li>
    <li> The Amazon reviewers come through yet again! I bought this shaver because of the good reviews! And it is great! Previously, I had owned a cordless shaver and it always fizzled out after a shave or two! The battery just couldn&#x27;t store much power. With this corded shaver, it always works and it cuts pretty good. Not as good as a regular razor but good enough for a regular day of work or play. If I have to look immaculate, I simply use the regular razor after I use the corded shaver and it only takes a minute or two to get the shave really close! This shaver has really made my life easier---if there&#x27;s anything I hate to do, it shaving!!! Thank you, Amazon reviewers!!!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this shaver as a replacement for my old Norelco Rotatract 1600, as the price seemed reasonable, as soon as I turned it on the motor was much quiter than my old shaver and while shaving my chin, the shaver was so slugis it akmost stopped working, mind you, I shave daily so I did not have a beard.&lt;br /&gt;I returned the shaver and will look for a better one, as I was very dissapointed that Norelco would sell such an under powered rasor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with this shaver; I should have replaced my old Norelco shaver much sooner.  This unit gives a very fast, close shave, and is incredibly quiet compared to my previous shaver.  It doesn&#x27;t have batteries, but I eventually realized that the only place where I would need a battery powered shaver is on a camping trip, and who shaves anyway on a camping trip?</li>
    <li> The item was just as it was discribed. Very pleased with the delivery time and very pleased with the operation of the Razor and the price was right.</li>
    <li> The shaver works very well. Good, close shave. Only wish I had read the information a little closer before I purchased. Don&#x27;t care for a &#x27;corded&#x27; razor (not battery operated).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on a very tight budget, so I needed an inexpensive electric shaver that could do the job, and that is what I got. For only costing $40 (with free shipping) it is a decent shaver: sturdy, attractive, comes with a trimmer, and has replaceable heads like most models. Because it is non-rechargeable, it must be plugged in during use, but it also won&#x27;t stop working when a pair of batteries lose their ability to charge. (Which is why I stopped using rechargeable shavers.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest failure of this model is the really short power cord. When coiled, it is only about a foot long, and must be stretched out two or three times longer to get to my face. This is bad, because it easily gets pulled out of the wall socket, and I have to hold the cord in place with one hand while holding the shaver with the other. Rather annoying.</li>
    <li> My 30 year old Norelco died and they don&#x27;t make the repair parts. My old Norelco worked fine with the original heads until the motor quit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The current model is cheap in price and feels poorly made. They recommend replacing the heads annually, but I&#x27;ll use it until it fails and then toss it.</li>
    <li> If you stretch or pull the cord while your using the razor it has the tendency to fall out of the razor, I solved this by using tape or holding the plug in the razor while I shaved. It&#x27;s mostly plastic, so it won&#x27;t survive multiple drops(I keep it in a drawer most of the time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razor cleaning:&lt;br /&gt;Clean after each use- Trimmer&lt;br /&gt;Clean once a week- Razor( brush out the head assembly and top of housing)&lt;br /&gt;Clean every two months- Razor Head( Inside the head assembly and the cutter and combs)&lt;br /&gt;Replace every year for optimal shaving results- Razor heads</li>
    <li> This shaver replaced a more expensive rechargeable shaver when the batteries died.  The batteries in the old shaver were not replaceable.  This shaver shaves better.  So far I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> the Delivered was perfect&lt;br /&gt;the Watch is perfect&lt;br /&gt;It works properly&lt;br /&gt;everything was excellent&lt;br /&gt;so there is nothing to complain about</li>
    <li> This razor works perfect.  I&#x27;ve been using Norelco shavers for the past 20 years and had rechargeable shavers before.  This corded razor is consistent.  The rpms are the same every time I use it, unlike the rechargeable shavers.</li>
    <li> Pro: It&#x27;s so quiet that I thought it did not work at the first use. It works very well so far.&lt;br /&gt;Con: Cleaning it is not simple.</li>
    <li> Nice but too expensive for what it is.  It should have cost less than the battery powered but it costs three times more. I went with it because all the battery rechargables suck.</li>
    <li> I like the corded shaver it works fine until the blades dull. Only bad feature is replacement blades cost more then a new shaver Why??</li>
    <li> As most other Norelco razors are using batteries, this is one of only 2 models (now this one is the last)left that will work on AC ONLY (it has no batteries). A little know fact is that the other battery powered models(this one has no batteries)that also say they work with AC will not work when the batteries die, so they are worthless after about 3 years (according to Norelco). Also, the HQ55 blades are every bit the equal of the HQ8 and HQ9; I have both and the only difference is that the newer versions are a little faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco has very little info on this model; be aware that they will tell you that it uses the newer style power cord with the external transformer and that is not the case.  It uses the old fashioned plain coiled cord (and no batteries).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch for the sale right before Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Added:  I recently took both this model and the earlier version apart to swap some parts into a new 6945.  The 6940 has very high quality workmanship and parts, especially compared to the earlier cord only version.  It works with the newer HQ56 heads (still made in Holland, the heads not the shaver) and the HQ56 are significantly cheaper than the HQ55. I am increasing the score to 5 stars.</li>
    <li> My husband is very pleased and happy with this shaver. It certainly maintains the fine reputation of the company&#x27;s products. This shaver replaces an earlier model Norelco that he has had for more years than he can remember which was finally beginning to show its age, so it was time to get a new one.</li>
    <li> it worked for a while</li>
    <li> I like this shaver very much , it gives a nice close comfortable shave with no irritation or nicks . It is also much quieter than the Remington I had , the Phillips Norelco  also plugs into the outlet and runs on electric  rather than a battery .</li>
    <li> My ex-husband asked for help in finding replacement parts for his favorite old Philips Norelco 6940 razor.  By ordering through Amazon.com we were able to purchase a brand-new exact-replacement razor for less money than the cost of replacement parts (which may or may not have fit the old razor).  He&#x27;s very pleased!</li>
    <li> My last one of this model was really great, but this one has loose insides. It rattles when shaving. The blades that come with these models are also not as sharp as the replacement blades. I only purchased this because the blades are more to replace than the whole unit. For the money, it is alright.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for our son and it is hard to just a plain old electric plug in razor anymore at a good price.  This was one just fit the bill and he likes it very much.</li>
    <li> This Norelco razor is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;m usually a really cheap guy but I am very happy that I spent the 40 dollars to get this razor. I&#x27;ve never usually had a lot of facial hair so this electric razor definitely got the job done. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Seems light weight and slow, but husband says it gets the job done.  He is delighted that he doesn&#x27;t have to recharge it constantly like his old razor required.</li>
    <li> This is just what I wanted. The cordless ones are more money and eventually the batteries don&#x27;t work anymore. This solved that problem and gives a good shave too. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the cord keeps falling out of the shaver&#x27;s connector and the cord could be a little longer.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good, I liked</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my husband to replace the Norelco that he had been using for many, many years but was no longer running smoothly.  He doesn&#x27;t like change and he was able to transition to this shaver without difficulty.  As far as I can tell it works just fine, but the best part is that it&#x27;s so close to the one he had.</li>
    <li> Very quite cord is way too short. I went back to my old shaver because the cord is very short. and the side burn part is a little tough on the face.</li>
    <li> I looked around for a basic inexpensive razor.  I realized that I hardly ever used my shaver on batteries so why pay for that feature.  I figure I can buy a new razor every couple of years at this price rather than new cutting heads for for $30-35.  For the price I am happy.  The shaver has enough power and I did not expect the smoothness of a $100 shaver. The shaver seems sturdy enough. The shaver met my expectations.</li>
    <li> I like this shaver because it does just what I need it to do.  I get a close shave with little fuss - not quite as close as a blade can give, but with absolutely no risk of a cut - and at about $44 it&#x27;s much less expensive than almost all the other Philips Norelco shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not rechargeable, so you have to plug it in every time you shave, and the cord isn&#x27;t very long or flexible, so sometimes it will pull out of the shaver, interrupting the shave.  Just reinsert it and carry on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it doesn&#x27;t run on a rechargeable battery the motor never slows down due to declining battery power, and you don&#x27;t have to leave it plugged in to charge it up.  My guess is that it uses less electricity overall than a rechargeable.  Of course you have to have access to AC power to run it, but that&#x27;s only a problem if you want to take it with you on camping trips - not a good idea anyway.</li>
    <li> I needed to replace my Norelco and have always been happy with their razors, so went with them once more. I wanted a corded razor and this Norelco is pretty much like my previous one. I didn&#x27;t want anything fancy, just a razor that cut my beard and this one does an excellent job.</li>
    <li> I have shaved with Braun foil shavers for many years now and routinely replace the foil and cutter.  It seems like the last 2 years the Brauns are not doing their job very well.  Don&#x27;t know why.  Both are battery and ac shavers.  One I just threw away as the battery went, quit working on ac, and I destroyed it trying to get to the battery to replace it.  I then decided to buy a non-battery shaver that would run only on ac and would never have a battery problem again. I found this Philips Norelco and after reading the reviews went with it. I am pleased. This shaver cuts way better than my Brauns ever did and quicker. A couple of passes and my tough chin whiskers are gone. This shaver was 1/2 the price of my cheapest Braun. One thing that does help to give you a easier shave is to use a preshave like Williams Electric. I have been using this shaver for 3 weeks now. I would estimate that the cutting heads would need replacing at 6-12 months although some reviewers have gone much longer.  When my soon to be young men boys start shaving, we will go with Norelco. This shaver also does not make much noise and the cord does not fall out when using.</li>
    <li> This is my second Norelco razor.My first one was 7140XL. I thought i would buy a cheaper version than my previous one , big mistake. This razor does not have a battery like more expensive models , so it has to be plugged in all the time, this feature was not on the page when i purchased the razor.Also, the power cord is too short and constantly comes out.  The blades were not as sharp as other model and gave me bad razor burns and the replacement blades cost as much as the razor. If you plan on purchasing a electric razor , spend little more money and get a razor that will treat your face good and not burn or cut you. If you&#x27;re cheap or on a budget do not pay more than $25 and buy lots of after shave lotion.</li>
    <li> I guess I should thank the Chinese.  The price of this model is very competitive because the Chinese have an identical (looking) product for $20 or less.  I got the Norelco because it&#x27;s the cheapest way to get their 3 blade system which is the fastest and best way to get a good shave.  The 3 head system cannot address really tough beards I&#x27;ve found, only normal ones.  In normal use, you will find that it is good on the neck and sideburns but absolutely the best within the &#x27;triangle&#x27; of your mustache and chin, the spot where blades and flat electric razors are far too rough.  Overall, I strongly recommend not just Norelco 3 blades system but this model because it&#x27;s corded.  I had the same thing in the cordless model and it did fail after two years.  Batteries fail, but corded razors are virtually indestructible.</li>
    <li> My brother is not easy to buy for, but he loved this shaver.  It was exactly what he wanted, so both of us were happy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with Norelco Shavers since 1970. I thought this shaver was cordless and waterproof because that&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve ever used. Turns out neither was true and the ad doesn&#x27;t mention it requires being plugged in to an outlet. I assumed and I was wrong, but in my case the ad was misleading because I expected it to be at least cordless. You can be sure I&#x27;ll think twice before I buy anything else on-line</li>
    <li> I have purchased Norelco Shavers since they started making them. No Fooling. This is the best one yet!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I have one just like it for over 25 years and it&#x27;s a true corded razor. It gives a very good shave for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To set the record straight my husband Thomas entered the review he is the one who uses the razor. He ordered it through my account.</li>
    <li> Worked fine for about a month.  Then quit on me.  Well, it still works fine as long as I don&#x27;t touch it or apply it to my face.  But once I put any pressure on any part of it, the motors shuts off.  It starts up again once I let go, but that won&#x27;t do you any good unless you really just enjoy listening to the hum of the motor.  So I guess I could repurpose it as a white noise machine, but for shaving, its completely useless.</li>
    <li> We have had this for a while now and my boyfriend still uses this. The purchase was worth every cent.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this shaver, even if one sale. I tried to convince myself so Im here to tell you not to try to convince yourself. You will need to spend money on a good shaver, your face and scruff will thank you.</li>
    <li> Works well &amp; my son loves it, it arrived on time and in good condition, I would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> This shaver does what it is supposed to do, quietly and easily.  After several months of use, I have concluded that it is reliable.  Two things that could be improved: the cord is a little too short, and the entire head pops off for cleaning, instead of hinging up as my previous Philips Norelco did.</li>
    <li> Great budget electric razor. Pretty decent shave and the flip out trimmer is nice. Easy to pop the blade off to clean or replace. Only down side is the short power cord. Not a big deal for me though cause I have a plug right by my mirror.</li>
    <li> I used Norelco products when I was younger. I like this one. It gives a comfortable shave and is much easier than dragging out the blade razor.</li>
    <li> Very Happy with this purchase!!</li>
    <li> When I purchased the razor I assumed (my mistake) that it was cordless-rechargeable. It wasn&#x27;t.  I was contacted by the company to see if all was well but when I told them I had mistakenly purchased the wrong razor I got no response.  My husband is using it but hates it.  A response would have been nice especially since THEY asked.</li>
    <li> After 20+ years with my original Norelco, it finally broke.  I was looking for a simple razor without too many bells and whistles.  This is a simple design, does a great job and it is relatively inexpensive.  I don&#x27;t care for rechargable razors simply because I don&#x27;t like them sitting on my bathroom sink all the time, I prefer one I can put in a drawer when I&#x27;m not using it.</li>
    <li> Bought this for a gift and it&#x27;s exactly what he wanted. Good close shave, no irritation. Great price. Thank you Amazon.</li>
    <li> My husband said it shaves as close as his razor did without the knicks!  He loves it.  :)</li>
    <li> My husband wanted a shaver that was easy to use when he wanted to use it without waiting for an electric charge.  It does that.</li>
    <li> It works amazing. very close shave i love it. i highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Anemic motor barely turns rotary heads.  Lacks enough power, esp for a corder razor. I&#x27;m very disappointed and I&#x27;m returning this razor. Perhaps the \\&quot;Made in China\\&quot; is the cause?</li>
    <li> Good shaver. If you&#x27;ll use this every day it will make good quality shaving. If you&#x27;ll wait before hair grown more then 2 mm this shaver will work worse and shaving process will take more time. If you try to shave 5 mm long hair shaver will not be able</li>
    <li> Have used the shaver for about 2 weeks.  It has a fairly close shave for an electric shaver, but not quite as good as a razor blade.  And the Norelco takes half the time.  One negative is that the electric cord is short (3 ft.).  it would be better if it was at lest 1-2 feet longer.</li>
    <li> My dad has been using his plug in Phillips norelco shaver for 25 years, with the same blade too. I have been using mine for a few. These shavers are extremely quick and easy to use, and make no mess. They make a nice clean shave, although understandably aren&#x27;t quite as close as a razor and cream. I do think the difference  however is negligible/unimportant to an average person. It certainly is for me. These shavers are reliable and extremely economical. Because they are plug in, batteries will not need to be replaced every couple years like with the cordless models. This model also has the pop-up accessory/beard trimmer. I highly recommend this product.utweigh all of the aforementioned benefits. I&#x27;ve also heard people complain that electric razors hurt a bit, but I do not notice that either. The only time it hurts for me is when I haven&#x27;t shaved in like ten days and then I proceed to use my dad&#x27;s 25 year old blade. Otherwise there would be nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the benefits of electric shaving are phenomenal. And this is the best model of electric shaver out there that I am aware of, I feel.</li>
    <li> It is Philips; what I can say.</li>
    <li> Got this as a 2013 Christmas present.  I only need to shave every 3 to 4 days and this is now pulling my hair outta my face and very painful after only 10 months of use. (approximately 90 uses)  I have had prior Norelco shavers that have lasted years,  I guess they are making them cheaper every day.  I now use the bic double blace rasors and one will last about a month plus I can purchase about 5 years worth for less money than this piece of cheap crap.</li>
    <li> This is a great item for the price!  I was impressed, nothing fancy but it performs great each time I use it.</li>
    <li> My husband is very happy with it.  He doesn&#x27;t like t deal with battery shavers.  Thank you for continuing to make this model.</li>
    <li> 5 star even with the three rotary blades.  That comes out to 1.666... blades per star.  What I like about this product is its ability to shave.  It doesn&#x27;t try to be something it isn&#x27;t like a coal furnace or an electric eel.  I would buy this again if I had two faces. It fits nicely inmy hand which was damaged when pinched in a door to a torpedo tube on a Lebanese nuclear sub in the 70&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Gives a good but not super close shave. It runs quiet, gets those hairs on the neck, and operates only plugged in. For those that look for a shaver on a plug without battery fuss, this is a good choice.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver i&#x27;ve used so far to get the best shave possible using an electric shaver.  this model is also cheaper then buying new replacement blades so why not buy a whole new unit.</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco 6940 Reflex Action mens shaving system did not work as well as I had hoped for!!!  ELECTRIC SHAVERS --------REALLY?</li>
    <li> I have two of these Philips Norelco electric shavers. I leave one at work and have 1 at home. Love them!</li>
    <li> Bought for great nephew (15) he likes the electric razor over the shaving cream and razor way. He is able to keep it clean, and take care of it.</li>
    <li> close shave with the least amount of effort and no battery to worry about running&lt;br /&gt;out of power, a great value for the price.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas present for my 17 yr old son. He loves it! It perfect for him as he is a teenager and is just starting to shave. I do recommend this electric shaver as does my son.</li>
    <li> I have owned a lot of Philips Norelco shavers - many different models.  Two things I have noticed.  First, they do a good job shaving.  Second, sometime after two years (when the warranty has run out) the nickel cadmium batteries stop working.  They gradually hold less and less of a charge until they stop working altogether.  Unfortunately, the shaving unit does not work, even when plugged in, without working batteries.  One is then forced to buy another shaver (hence my collection of defunct Norelco razors).  The situation is not quite as bad as it seems since by the time the battery kicks out, one generally needs to buy new blades which are expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor gives the same good shave that the others I have had.  In addition, I am confident that the battery will never fail since it does not have one.  At first the lack of battery seems like a real minus if you plan to travel, but when one realizes that pretty much all bathrooms have electric plugs in them, this is not such a big deal.  As an added travel bonus, this shaver is easier to pack than some other Norelco shavers that have large plug units.  And, of course, the lower price is nice too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me add that the Philips Norelco customer service is excellent and that they will honor their warranty.</li>
    <li> I am lazy to use a razor. So, I bought this. This does the job on the cheeks. But is not good on the neck. Does not give the closest shave on the neck, making you repeat several times eventually taking as long as it takes for a razor. But not close enough as a razor. Worse, i had redness on my neck both times i used it. Maybe my skin is allergic to its blades or my skin is not used to it. Will not use it for clean shaves. Only for trimming. Not Satisfied.</li>
    <li> After reading other reviews, I bought the Norelco 6940 because I was going to use it in one place and just wanted something functional.  I have always shaved with a safety razor, but have recently lost a lot of my mobility, so figured this would be a low cost experiment.  I&#x27;m delighted.  The fears of not getting a close shave are generally unwarranted.  I have used it for a month now, and haven&#x27;t had any &#x27;razor rash&#x27; problems (using my same after-shave lotion).  Could be just me and my skin (which has 62 years of use on it now), but this was a great deal!  I don&#x27;t plan on shaving in the car or out camping, so the plug-in model works just great for me.  And if the blades only last a year, I&#x27;ll buy another then, and probably not be spending any more than I was with a safety razor (those blades are bloody expensive!)</li>
    <li> This was my second Norelco and it is much improved.  Didn&#x27;t think a battery driven shaver would be good but it is better than I expected especially since you don&#x27;t have to recharge for almost a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gives pretty good shave except with theose little hairs on the lower portion of the neck.  Would I advice a purchase?  Absolutely!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it.....you&#x27;ll like it</li>
    <li> this corded electric shaver is basic and cheap, exactly what i wanted. shaves smooth( i dont consider  my facial hair as thick)and cleans easily so far with no need to remove the blades for cleaning.</li>
    <li> I always use electric shavers and I like rotary type better than the linear type. The problem with rechargable ones is the battery life...once dead, you have to throw the shaver away because it won&#x27;t run even with the cord plug-in. Those batteries don&#x27;t last very long!&lt;br /&gt;I found this one is great because it does not have a battery! So, I don&#x27;t have to worry about wasting a perfectly good shaver just because the battery is dead. Besides, this one is powerful enough for me (most time) to get a clean cut better than the rechargable ones I had before....although the motor can be a little more poerful sometimes. The flexible rotary head is perfect for the contour of the face!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this new razor and it was cheaper than replacement heads for his old razor.  Another reader commented why pay for cordless razors when he always shaved by a light plug.  Ding! the light bulb went on along with big savings.</li>
    <li> This shaver seems to be performing quite well. I have been using it for 2 weeks and I am quite pleased with the price I paid. I would buy again. Phillips Norelco 6940 Reflex Action Shaver</li>
    <li> He loves it!&lt;br /&gt;I will buy more to give to my friends and relatives.</li>
    <li> I just wanted a shaver that would work when I plugged it in.  Must everything operate on a battery?  Shaves well and quickly and powers right up.  That&#x27;s what I wanted.  If that what you want, this is what you should buy.</li>
    <li> Have a bit of skin issues on my legs, and can&#x27;t use a blade type razor.  I have tried ladies razors, and found them to be a joke.  Give me a good old Norelco every time.&lt;br /&gt;This purchase was a replacement of the identical product that has worked great for&lt;br /&gt;over 7 years.  Finally the blades got dull, and a new shaver is cheaper than the&lt;br /&gt;replacement blades.  Only drawback is that the plug that attaches to the razor tends to slip off during use.  I solved that problem with a bit of electrical tape.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read other reviews that say one should use a shaver for at least three weeks to let the shaver adapt to his beard. I&#x27;ve only used this one for ten days and I&#x27;m amazed at how comfortable this inexpensive model feels on my skin. It shaves closer than a Norelco triple-header I owned back in the 1980s. I&#x27;m extremely happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t want a rechargeable so I searched until I found this one. My last shaver, a Remington MS-280, died after three years; the battery would no longer hold a charge. And compared to the MS-280 this Norelco is extremely quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is the short power cord. But a little stretching daily should loosen the tension of the wound cord and eliminate that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want simple and functional in a rotary shaver, I recommend this model.</li>
    <li> I bought this for travel. Too much of a hassle to pack the recharging stand that unfortunately has become part of most razors...the stands are made of plastic, too likely to break in a suitcase. For short trips, I can take my good razor and not have to worry about recharging....but anything close to a week and it&#x27;s too risky to run out of charge.  So......I went looking for a razor with an electrical cord that I could just plug in.  To me, the cordless feature isn&#x27;t that critical - sure it&#x27;s nice, but it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m going for a walk while shaving.  The only way I could find to get a corded razor is to buy a leftover one from yesteryear.  This one works okay, but a far cry from the current models.  Too bad they don&#x27;t offer a corded model with today&#x27;s technology as far as heads, comfort, closeness, etc.  It seems they&#x27;ve fallen in love with the idea of (a) cordless and (b) having to make room for a charging stand that sits out on the vanity permanently.  Whatever happened to just plugging in the razor to charge it, like a cell phone?</li>
    <li> I have always purchased Norelcos with cords as I don&#x27;t like the rechargeables. This one seems to have diminished in quality compared to earlier models. The cord continually falls out of it - very annoying</li>
    <li> Its nice. I like how i never get burns or cuts. I do have to go back over with a razor because it always misses a few little hairs. The flip out buzzer is a nice tool for my pubes.</li>
    <li> I have an ancient Norelco 725RL that has worked great for more years than I can remember. Concerned that it would eventually fail I bought the 6940. It&#x27;s a good replacement. It seems to take a bit longer to get a close shave but that&#x27;s it&#x27;s only drawback. I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a very good razor. Its one of the few that runs w/o batteries. I would reccomend it highly.</li>
    <li> Not powerful, but gives a decent shave.  A basic razor at a value price.  No bells and whistles, but compact and handy for travel.</li>
    <li> This Philips Norelco 6940 reflex action shaver does a very good job.  It gives a very close shave in a very quick time.  The only complaint would be that it is a nosier than other Norelcos I have owned.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used an expensive Braun electric shaver for years.  It never gave a really close shave, but I figured with my rather tough beard I was getting the best I was going to get.  Recently the blades went out of line and I was getting nicked, so I decided to buy a cheap replacement.  This Norelco is great.  The shave is closer than the Braun (because it does shave so close there is skin irritation for awhile.  I use Lectric Shave and a face balm which helps) and the difference in the noise level is incredible.  The Braun was like a buzz saw that hurt my ears and woke everyone in the house up.  The Norelco makes a soft whirring sound.  The triple head does take some getting used to, and the cord can be cumbersome, but the changes are worth it.</li>
    <li> I have had Norelco shavers for the past 40+ years and they worked great. Unfortunately I had to purchase a new unit and faced sticker shock. I had a cordless Norelco just prior and it would cost more to replace the blades than buy a new unit so I purchased this corded shaver. The blades within one month did not hold up. My wife asks me if I shave even after I do. This is a plastic piece of junk that should not bear the name of what was once a great shaver.</li>
    <li> This product is basic--no bells and whistles.  But it does its job admirably and efficiently.  I&#x27;ve never found the battery operated Norelco shavers to be worth the extra expense.  For an excellent shaver that does just that, this product is highly recommended.</li>
    <li> very good construction&lt;br /&gt;shaves very well&lt;br /&gt;ease of use&lt;br /&gt;excellent buy&lt;br /&gt;wish it was portable&lt;br /&gt;compact size for travel use</li>
    <li> I bought a NORELCO ,  months ago , awesome deal , so I figured I buy a back-up but didn&#x27;t notice , this one  wasn&#x27;t cordless</li>
    <li> The razor came two days faster than it told me. (amazon is always like that. It cuts really close, but not too close. It cuts great and its great. I totally recommend this product.</li>
    <li> As a women I do not like women&#x27;s razors they just do not work well, I always used my dad&#x27;s electric razor and after 20 years of use it died so I bought the same one he had since it worked so well. The newr version is mot made of the heavy medal my dad&#x27;s was made of which makes it lighter and easier to handle and gives a very close clean cut for an electric razor. My only concern is since I don&#x27;t have a space in my bathroom to store a rechargable razor I went with the same one I had with a cord the only diference is the cord is much shorter than my older razor making it a little challenging to shave. I wish they had keep the longer cord on the newer razor.</li>
    <li> Norelco has shortened the cord to such a degree that I needed to use an extension cord to reach the electrical outlet NEXT to the wash basin.  Some checking on why they did such a thing indicates that it was to save money on cordage costs.  This obviously to make the shareholders happy, not the consumers who buy the product.  Thumbs down Phillips Norelco.</li>
    <li> Nice product for the price.  This was for one of my grandsons and so far so good.  He reports that it works well with no problems.  A good purchase for the price.</li>
    <li> Works very well. I like rotary shavers that work at home on regular AC. I dislike the rechargebles, personally anyway, though it would always be good to have one at work in a desk drawer. But at home, I prefer the 120v AC type ones, No rechargeable batts to contend with. I do get razor burn at times though owing to fact that I use this shaver only maybe 3 times a week....rest of times, I use razor blade type shavers. Hence, my face is not really conditioned, but to reduce razor burn, some of those pre electric shave lotions applied generously have been helpful in reducing the burn. If not used, people often inquired about the redness around my neck. So, if you buy this, and I gotta say, it gives a smooth shave, is quiet, has a nice trimmer, handles a two three day unshaven thick beard if need be, it&#x27;s maybe good to use some per electric lotion....maybe even as part of ritual if you use daily.The lotion makes the facial hairs stand out making it easier to cut. Also, dunno why, but the shaver seems to work smoother on the face using lotion.</li>
    <li> i like its smooth and quiet shaving action. i have been using razor blade and i have developed skin rash. hopefully this shaver takes care of my skin rash.</li>
    <li> Good shaver at the price but lacks a trimmer. I&#x27;d probably pay a little more to get one with a trimmer.</li>
    <li> Like many of you, I still was using my ancient Norelco and decided to buy a new one. This one at first seemed sort of toylike, it&#x27;s pretty light in your hand and doesn&#x27;t have the high horse power \\&quot;roar\\&quot; of the older models, which made me worry that it was too weak. Not the case. The blades on this thing are plenty sharp and precise. Move slowly and carefully with it and be patient. Just like the manual says, give your skin a chance to adjust to the cut, and within about a day or so, you&#x27;ll have that consistent smooth feeling when you pass your hand across your face. I&#x27;m watching my pennies and didn&#x27;t want to spend the big dough on a shaver and this one works very nicely indeed. Thank you to my favorite online store Amazon, once again. Thank you to all of you folks who take the time to do these reviews too, because I have benefited from that a million times,.... whether it&#x27;s watches, garden tools, PC games, shavers or what have you, it&#x27;s a good community here.</li>
    <li> After year of messing around with cordless/batteries...just keep it simple.  This works great. It probably won&#x27;t ever die.  Although the replacement blade are expensive enough that you might as well buy a new razor every 3-5 years, or whenever you think the blades are not cutting well enough.</li>
    <li> i HAD ONE OF THESE OVER 20 YEARS AGO,ONLY A DOUBLE HEADER, AND IT WAS VERY GOOD AND EASY TO CLEAN, AND SEEMED TO BE BETTER QUALITY THAN THIS ONE. JUST OK FOR THE $40.&lt;br /&gt;I WAS GOING TO SEND IT BACK, BUT I HAD ALREADY THROWN AWAY THE PACKING AND BOX. ALSO THE NEW RAZORS ARE SO EXPENSIVE, SO EXPENSIVE THAT AN ORDINARY PERSON CAN BARELY AFFORD IT!  VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE NEW NORELCO....</li>
    <li> A good old fashioned- no frills corded shaver that works well at a good price.  I figure any where I&#x27;m likely to be shaving I&#x27;m near an outlet- No problem.  Why pay extra for cord-less if you don&#x27;t need it ?  And this has Full power 100% of the time.  I recently took back a new cordless Remington triple head straight head shaver ( not from Amazon )  Worst piece of Cr__  I ever had- couldn&#x27;t even cut butter !</li>
    <li> This is the third one of this model that I have purchased. All have been excellent. I like to replace them about every three years.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for</li>
    <li> I do not have to say any more, it&#x27;s perfect. 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 asd s</li>
    <li> Pros: Good Razor.  Well Built.  The first thing I did was to open package and immediately drop the thing from a height of 3ft.  Did not break or damage it in any way.  Arrived quickly well within time promised.  Packaged well.  Good fit in hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  None</li>
    <li> I got a great price for 1 shaver, so I got 2 of them for my husband for Christmas. After he used it, he loved the way it shaved his face, and I was glad I purchased an extra one for when we travel.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001AJ6QNA Philips Norelco 6940 Reflex Action Men&#x27;s Shaving System]]&lt;br /&gt;My beard eats shavers. It will eat two double edge razors for one shave. I took this out of the box, and one swipe left perfection!&lt;br /&gt;Thirty seconds and my face was smooth- that is saying something! I had an old Norelco years ago and it always worked fine, I shouldn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;have waited so long to get another. This one is not rechargeable, but it is all I need and works great.&lt;br /&gt;Update: Exactly one year later- Still sharp and fast shave!!!</li>
    <li> I have used the shaver for many weeks now and am very pleased with the shave I get.  I tried an electric shaver many years ago and it caused terrible skin irritation.  So I was pleasantly surpised when this shaver gave me such a good shave with no skin irritation. However I have had one serious problem that would cause me to not buy it again.  The electric cord keeps coming loose where it connects to the shaver and causes the shaver to constantly go off while I am using it. The constant interruptions are very frustrating. I will soon buy another Norelco with the same floating blades but with a rechargeable battery to get rid of the cord problem.  While I will buy another Norelco, it will not be this one.  I will gladly pay more to avoid this problem.</li>
    <li> We couldn&#x27;t find it in any stores here. Hence why I love amazon, they usually have what your looking for.He says it shaves well. He is happy with it, very similar to the older model he had.</li>
    <li> I have a decade-old Remington that sounds like a leaf blower when I start it.  This one is much more sedate, and it takes a few passes to get my face &amp;#34;as smooth as a blade.&amp;#34;  Too bad Philips doesn&#x27;t do the &amp;#34;or your money back&amp;#34; pledge that Remington does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know Amazon would accept it back, but this does the job.  I don&#x27;t care if it takes another sweep or three.  My time isn&#x27;t that precious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cord isn&#x27;t short - it&#x27;s the same length as my Remington.  It&#x27;s just coiled tightly - the insulation holds its shape better.  Fortunately, my Remington&#x27;s cord fits it fine.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a long time since I&#x27;ve bought this and now I&#x27;m reviewing it. First off, I&#x27;ve used this for around 2.5 years before it broke last week while cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good electric shaver (better than manual) as it shaves all the way down to the pore. I&#x27;ve taken it overseas for many holidays and find it good to use.&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like is cleaning it. It is very hard to clean.</li>
    <li> This low cost device does a fine job leaving you with a very smooth face and neck.  Because it is plugged into the wall, it never \\&quot;runs down\\&quot; like battery powered shavers.  All-in-all, a great deal.</li>
    <li> my only compaint is that the replacement heads r so darn expensive.. they r fooling us.. every year 35 bucks or so for new blades.. not worth it</li>
    <li> This little inexpensive dude does an adequate job if you don&#x27;t mind going over and over your face to get a decent shave. If this little jewel had about twice the horsepower it would be an awesome purchase, even for a corded only razor. The motor in this model is so weak, it feels like your shaving with a toy razor.  Finding a good razor that is efficient and economical is like searching for the Holy Grail. Where is Wahl when you really need them! I have a 45 day trial period with this razor and I have tried it for 4 weeks with soso results. It may well be sent packing back to Norelco.</li>
    <li> Este producto lo compre para mi papa y ha quedado encantado, nada que ver con marcas costosas. este es super practico y funciona a la perfeccion.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor to replace my old Norelco. My old one, which is at least 15 years old, still works, but I can&#x27;t get replacement blades... or at least I can&#x27;t find ones that are less than twice the cost of the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I really like the new razor.  It is much quieter than the old one and gives me a nice close shave.  I&#x27;ve read a few of the other reviews where they don&#x27;t like the short cord.  Actually, the cord is the same length as the one from my old razor.  What I can tell you, my old cord, which is coiled like the new one, did loosen up and stretch out over a period of time so what may seem to be a little short would probably turn out to be just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I have any complaint with the Norelco razors, it is with the replacement blades.  They recommend your change blades every year.  Personally, I&#x27;ve never found that I&#x27;ve needed to change them that often.  As long you keep them clean, I&#x27;ve been able to make them last for 18 months to two years.  But when you do replace them, the blades are ridiculously expensive, particularly if you buy the actual Norelco blades.  As I mentioned earlier, they are often more expensive than the razor itself... by a significant amount.  If they want us to replace them every year, I think their price point should be $10-15 not $25-35.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last thing, I bought it here on Amazon for a very good price (cheaper than my local Wal-mart) and the shipping was free. Great deal all around.</li>
    <li> I have had a 5822xl Norelco for so long that I can&#x27;t remember how old it is. It was a corded/cordless model and I realized I never used it without the cord. When I decided to replace it this 6940 seemed like a bargain. Why pay for batteries I didn&#x27;t need?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a disappointment when I got this shaver. It looked cheaply made and was so light I knew it couldn&#x27;t have a very big motor and I was right. The blade speed was so slow that it would have taken forever to finish my face. I had read some good reviews online which tells me the quality control in China where these are made is non-existent.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor especially for the price.  You don&#x27;t have to spend a lot of money for one, some prices are absurd.  And this does as good as any razor will do.  Paying more is only throwing your money away.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great at covering a lot of area efficiently (i.e., legs), but for some reason, my armpits always turn red and itch after I shave them.  I tried soaking the head in alcohol, in case there was some substance causing the bad reaction, but the rash persists.  It does not affect me anywhere else like this, especially the bikini line, so I&#x27;m baffled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The construction is a little lightweight, so I&#x27;m afraid it won&#x27;t last very long, but my husband&#x27;s Norelco has lasted decades, so that&#x27;s why I picked this brand.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t remember when I received my Norelco 6940 Reflex shaver but it has been quite some time, probably more than a year.&lt;br /&gt;  I had no reason to get a cordless shaver since I am retired and only shave in front of my mirror. I looked for quite a while because I saw no reason to pay the price for the cordless function but I never found a non-cordless razor in the retail stores. I finally searched Amazon and found this one.&lt;br /&gt;  I have been using my shaver since I received it and have been happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;  To be totally honest, I do shave with a safety razor about once a week because I have never been totally satisfied with an electric razor, even the previous Norelco which was cordless.</li>
    <li> The shaver looks good, is easy to use, makes a low level noise, and gives a really good clean cut.</li>
    <li> I have had a number of Norelco corded shavers and this one was very quiet, shaved close, and was an excellent buy.  I would recommend to anyone who wants a good corded shaver.</li>
    <li> Not a good shave with this thing. After a few months an even worse shave.</li>
    <li> I have been using this every morning for about 2 weeks and the first time i turned it on i did not think is was running for how quite it was.  It does a very good close shave much quicker than anything i have used in the past.  I am sure there are more expensive ones but for what i paid i can not complain even if i only get a year or so out of it.</li>
    <li> I have bought many shavers and trimmers and this is the worst of all. You have to scratch your face before it removes the hair, reason why you will always end up irritated or even with small injuries. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Last for years work great</li>
    <li> This shaver lives up to the fine Norelco reputation.  It gives a really smooth close shave!  I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s not to like. This cheap and works like the expensive ones.</li>
    <li> This is not a portable razor with all the bells and whistles. It is a plain plug-in unit that works just like they say it would. What more can you ask for?</li>
    <li> Cuts are too slow and not that good.  Plug comes out of the wall and the razor very easily.  Not very happy.</li>
    <li> My husband loves his new electric shaver first I ever got him and he loves it works really good. His skin breaks out alot when he uses razors but this one his skins looks really great after he uses it.</li>
    <li> Another item I bought for my husband that he is happy with.  Two for me.</li>
    <li> I certainly think a good electric shave should be closer&#x27;still have to go over my face while I am in the shower.</li>
    <li> these units work very well and i have been suing many different ones over the years. no need to spend a ton.  one of these will do the job fine.</li>
    <li> When I turned 18 I asked my dad to buy me a fancy cordless electric razor. He suggested I get a corded one, &amp;#34;It&#x27;ll last longer,&amp;#34; he said. But I insisted and he bought me that fancy cordless razor. Here I am, a few years later, buying a corded razor after the battery in my fancy cordless razor finally gave out. Should have listened to my dad.</li>
    <li> I gave this material to my daughter&#x27;s husband and he is already enjoying it. I could not think of what to give him and this met his expectations. I liked it as a gift . He likes it as a razor. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Works the way it&#x27;s supposed to. Great performance for an awesome price. Since it&#x27;s corded, you also never have to worry about batteries, which is a plus.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 17 year old son, he loved it.  The 20 or more words to write about this product did suck though</li>
    <li> We purchased this electric razor as a lightening deal on amazon. It was the first electric razor my husband has had. He does use it regularly and it&#x27;s fine. He is use to a very close clean shave of a non-electric razor, so he still sometimes uses his regular razor as a supplement to this razor.</li>
    <li> My mistake for not making sure it was waterproof and/or battery. Performs it&#x27;s function however is not the easiest to take apart and clean (especially without water). In retrospect, I would have paid an additional $5-10 bucks and gotten a shaver with greater ability.</li>
    <li> I have nicer shavers than this (i.e., they give a better shave), but remain astounded that they are all battery operated. Result: After about a year, the battery ceases to hold a charge for more than a few days and you have to be constantly re-charging it. This is the last of a dying breed, but it always works and never runs short of power.</li>
    <li> given as gift but is same as old one.. unfortunately is is cheaper to buy a new razor than to purchase new cutters/heads for them.. and if you do.. they do not last as long as ones on new razors.. go figure?</li>
    <li> The product description should be more clear to point out this is a corded only product.  I should have checked it more thoroughly.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend really enjoys this! He was surprised at how close it gets to his skin. He is a black male and has had a lot of problems with bumps and this has actually helped get those little hairs that normal grow back under the skin!!</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco products for nearly 40 years so have a definite preference for their electric shavers.  I don&#x27;t need a cordless shaver and having a battery is a waste when I don&#x27;t shave in my car or shave while visiting a coffee shop or other business in the morning on my way to work.  So I ordered one of the few Norelco shavers that operates only while plugged in.  While this shaver is not terrible, it clearly is not built as well as the older Norelco shavers I have had.  The motor sounds weak and if I don&#x27;t shave every day, the blades have trouble giving me a close shave and I&#x27;m not a manly man as far as facial hair.  While this is a serviceable product, it has so far been a less than satisfactory purchase.  I still have an ancient Norelco that works better than the new one.</li>
    <li> This corded razor shaves just as well and rapidly as the rechargable Norelco that costs 4 times as much.  The color is nice, too.  My barber advised me to get the the cheapest model then discard it when it became less efficient, getting a new one on sale.</li>
    <li> My husband likes this shaver very much.  Does a good job on his wiskers!!  And he only wanted a corded shaver which this is.</li>
    <li> THE BEST RAZOR I&#x60;VE OWNED IN 50 YEARS OF SHAVING WITH AN ELECTRIC RAZOR . I WOULD RECCOMEND TO ANYONE . ALSO GREAT PRICE</li>
    <li> this is just enough of what you need for a simple daily shave. may not work very well on a week-long beard.</li>
    <li> The item is highly effective, cheap and well made. The only gripe one may have is the lack of carry pouch, but you cannot demand one at this price point. And I do not have to run out of juice after shaving one side of my face as it is common with battery-operated shavers.</li>
    <li> With all the cordless razors out there, this is still the best shave for the best price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No batteries to run down, there&#x27;s a plug in every bathroom at home and ever hotel in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can put it in the medicine closet and not clutter up the sinktop with a big base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good shave and a razor that has lasted a long time.</li>
    <li> Philips Norelco 6940  without battery  can&#x27;t charge, can only use plugged.Do not have the portability.too bad .So i hate it</li>
    <li> This shaver is honestly great. Its the second shaver I&#x27;ve owned, and the last one I had costed about 150$. With that being said it compared very well with my old one. The shave is nice and close, but doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation. The pop out trimmer is also great. The only downside is the fact that it needs to be plugged in to work, but that is usually manageable. Best Shaving System I&#x27;ve ever owned, and for such a low price it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> The Last of the great corded shavers available out there....Works and shaves like a dream....No battery&lt;br /&gt;problems here ever...a great shave at a reasonable price ...highly recommended.....</li>
    <li> I love that this electric razor plugs into the wall! It is hard to find a razor that will plug in these days. Batteries do make for &amp;#34;shave anywhere convince&amp;#34;, but with this razor plugging into the wall I don&#x27;t have to worry about the battery going bad. This razor has also made my razor burn virtually non existent!</li>
    <li> I find this to be a very practical and use-full basic corded shaver and would recommend to any one looking for a basic shaver.</li>
    <li> This razor is like a bad marriage, I could not have loved it more at the beginning nor hated it more at the end. On 4/25/2013 while getting ready to clean the razor head the razor heads fell off the razor. I had registered on the Norelco web site but when I went to log in the site did not recognize my email address. This in spite of the fact I had been sent emails from Norelco since registration to the same email address. I contacted customer service on line but they could not help me ant told me to call a Norelco number when they opened. Very disappointed in the razor, in the Norelco web site and in it&#x27;s customer service.&lt;br /&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;It seemed like the older I get, the less effective my manual razors become. I have both the Gillette Fusion and the Schick Hydro 5. They both give good shaves but it takes about 10 -15 minutes to achieve the look at wanted - and even then some remnants of hair remained. My last experience with an electric razor was years ago and a nick-filled experience. The Norelco 6940 is fast, nick-free and closer than my manual razors. Its  drawbacks are the trimmer is not as efficient as the manual razors, and the electrical cord is short. Maybe Norelco designed the cord to force a close up shave - if so it works. Overall the advantages far outweighs the any drawbacks. Once you go electric, you never go back.</li>
    <li> I was so tired of women&#x27;s shavers not doing the job on my legs that at the suggestion of someone I decided to try a men&#x27;s shaver.  I bought this one and have been using it for quite a while now and I love it!  It shaves close and leaves my skin smooth.  Great shaver.</li>
    <li> This is an absolutely the worst electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever had.  It was very painful, it just pulled and didn&#x27;t cut.  It&#x27;s not very powerful at all and is a waste of money.  Don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
    <li> This was purchased for my dad as a Christmas gift. I hope he likes it. And if he doesn&#x27;t I&#x27;m hoping I can return it.</li>
    <li> My husband was disappointed in the RPMs.  He said that he didn&#x27;t think is was as good as some others he has had in the past.  It did cut his whiskers ok.</li>
    <li> When I bought, I didn&#x27;t find anywhere remind me there is no battery for this shaving razor.&lt;br /&gt;But when I got it, I dumbfounded, how can I travel with this stuff, carry the cord always, it&#x27;s insane.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I just buy a new one, throw this one in garbage can is the best choice.</li>
    <li> Shipped and delivered quick.  I like how this model plugs into the wall as opposed to a battery.  Many of the prior reviews helped me make this decision.  Stows away quickly and neatly and is ready to go instantly when needed.</li>
    <li> I received the Norelco 6940 in December from a Mr. S. Claus.  I believe this is my sixth Norelco triple header style razor.  The last one was a rather expensive battery powered model and to my mind just never shaved as well as the corded razors.  I fear corded razors may soon become a thing of the past so I was pleased to find this one and doubly pleased with how well it shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor has plenty of power, and delivers a close and comfortable shave on my heavy thick beard, not quite the same shave as Norelco&#x27;s of 15-20 years ago, but very satisfactory and at a terrific price.  The pop up trimmer opens smoothly and does a great job on sideburns, eyebrows, etc.  The razor is very quiet and I find it very ergonomic.  I like the way it feels in my hand, and the light weight makes it easy to use the trimmer and take a little extra time shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I would rate this shaver as an extremely good value, it does have a few flaws, most of which are a function of being re-engineered to the absolute lowest possible cost of production while still performing the designed function.  Here are a few of the design/production flaws that keep this from being a five star product (mainly mediocre fit &amp; finish issues): 1)  The cord is detachable and (as mentioned by others) quite short.  It doesn&#x27;t take very much to pull the cord out of the razor.  I fixed this by using the hot glue gun to make the cord more or less permanently attached.  Luckily my outlet is very close.  About all that can be done for the length is reverse twist the spiral to reduce the tension.  2)  The fit of the head on the body is a bit loose and it wiggles perceptibly.  This was corrected by using a small amount of epoxy to build up the perimeter of the frame ever so slightly until the head fit snugly.  3)  The materials seem to be &amp;#34;extremely lightweight&amp;#34; plastic (read: kinda cheap).  These things keep this from being a five star product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience is that Norelco cutter heads last about 2 years.  As others mentioned,  it will be cheaper to replace the entire razor than the cutter head.  At this price I will gladly consider this a two year razor, and am buying another one to have on hand when this on conks out or gets dull.  I don&#x27;t hesitate to recommend this razor.tter heads last about 2 years.  As others mentioned,  it will be cheaper to replace the entire razor than the cutter head.  At this price I will gladly consider this a two year razor, and am buying another one to have on hand when this on conks out or gets dull.  I don&#x27;t hesitate to recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> Good price. Good quality. Not too loud.&lt;br /&gt;Would like a longer cord to plug in, though.&lt;br /&gt;Why are they so stingy with length of the cord?</li>
    <li> I needed a shaver to keep at work.  On  rare occasions, I ran late and dashed out to catch my commute (forgetting to shave).  The shaver absolutely had to work on A/C power, since I never knew when it would be needed.  The other more expensive shavers used recharged batteries that could be dead or run down on the rare moment when I really needed them.  This shaver seemed to be the answer with its economical price.  I was very surprised at its quiet operation and the smooth shave it gave me.  The only drawback for my needs was the 18 inch coiled cord (two feet long when extended).  That was a little too short.  The problem was addressed with a cheap extension cord from the hardware store.  I hope Norelco keeps offering a shaver that runs on wall current.</li>
    <li> Philips is a great product easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Great site to buy from.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned Norelco electric shavers since I was 22 years old. To all of you who&#x27;ve only used a razor and shaving cream, or some other electric shaver, let me say this. It takes a few shaves for your skin to adapt to any new shaving system. I remember switching from the razor and shaving cream and at first thought the Norelco did ok, but not great. After about 2 weeks my shaves got much closer and smoother. The lift and cut Norelco cutters do an awesome job once your beard and skin are \\&quot;broken in\\&quot; to electric shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, this will be a new shaver to replace my 16 year old original, plus I also have a cordless Norelco for traveling and those days when I want touch up before a dinner or night out and I won&#x27;t be getting home till late. This shaver is a good deal at the $30 price point and a great deal foe anything less. It is simple, basic and it uses a common Norelco replacement blade system that has been around for years. As one other reviewer indicated, the build and quality of this particular razor is better than some other newer models, so get it while it lasts!</li>
    <li> i like corded shaver to avoid charge, and this is it. Also it is not expensive. Only regret that ther is no case for the shaver compare to the save goods in store.</li>
    <li> And no battery to worry about! Norelco razors don&#x27;t work when charging so if the battery runs out you can&#x27;t just plug it in and use it while charging. That&#x27;s why I got this corded one. Perfect.</li>
    <li> Nice looking Razor. Does the job. Problem is the cord keeps popping off. The on and off switch is eaisly knock off while you are shaving.</li>
    <li> Gives go shave for the money and don&#x27;t have to worry about battery going out. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The seller is prompt and excellent and will recommend this seller to anyone.As for the product, It does not cut properly. You have to go few back and forth in order to have a clean shave.I dont recommend this product though if you have a better shave BUT the price is what you get.</li>
    <li> Shoddy quality but i didnot pay much and it meets my needs.  I only occasionly shave with an electric shaver.  Years ago I had a NORELC razor and the quality was much better.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric shaver and I simply love it.  It gives me a close shave and is super easy to use.  I use Williams Lectric Shave with it and am very happy.</li>
    <li> I actually bought a new cutting edge at a good price, cord a little too short for easy use, but does a good job other wise.</li>
    <li> When you can purchase one of these for 20 dollars, that&#x27;s cheaper than buying replacement blades. I&#x27;ve used the same model the last 2 years so its due. If you have a beard that not to tough its a great shaver.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had it for years, still works fine. Can&#x27;t beat it for the money. I&#x27;ve dropped it and keeps on ticking.</li>
    <li> Better than expected. Only problem cord falls out of razor often. Easy to use &amp; comfortably designed to hold. Very nice unit.</li>
    <li> If you needed to shave that many body parts, then this is the shaver for you.  Or at least its for your kid that keeps sneaking in your bathroom to use yours.  Great deal!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my son.  He likes the close shave he is able to obtain with this system.</li>
    <li> la compra se realizo en el tiempo indicado y la calidad del producto ofrecida por el vendedor fast and secury</li>
    <li> was nicely packed  it was wraped in bubble wrap and also had packed in paper in box wasnt broke and works</li>
    <li> This is nice for men.use. I,m in china use this is very good for clearness my heare.so I,m happy use er.</li>
    <li> NEVER AGAIN, will I pay $100+ for a &amp;#34;cordless&amp;#34; electric razor that has a built in battery. I have had three in a row now that... simply put, they all lose power after about 6 months and their ability to hold a charge gets shorter and shorter, while their charging times get longer and longer. Until they fully fail and you have to keep them plugged in to run them. At which point they are no longer &amp;#34;cordless&amp;#34; now are they...lol? BTW most of the newer &amp;#34;cordless&amp;#34; shavers, you cannot even use with the power cord plugged in... which means you throw out your 100 dollar shaver and start all over when the cheap under-powered lithium batteries fail at the predetermined time. What a racket they have going. None of the cordless razors use standard batteries either... so you are looking at $40+ (plus shipping) to send them off for repairs. NEVER AGAIN. This is not a fancy shaver. It is not top of the line. But, you can plug it in and it cuts your beard.... end of story. I would buy a cordless shaver again, if they had one that used regular AA batteries that could be easily charged, swapped, and replaced. I have not yet found a decent cordless shaver though that uses normal batteries. Of course not... they want you to buy a new 100 dollar shaver every year....lol! One star off for the FAR too short cord that ships with this, but.. no frills it gets the job done. One of the only corded razors, still out there.</li>
    <li> For some situations a rechargeable shaver may not work for you.  If that is your situation too then I suggest that you consider this one.  And if you factor in the cost of replacement heads.... Well, this complete unit (at the time of my purchase) cost as much as the replacement heads.  Something to consider.</li>
    <li> that this is NOT a cordless, and does not, therefore, recharge. I forgot to look for the rechargeable feature when I bought it but I am nevertheless very satisfied with the close shave I get with this product. Just be aware that it requires the cord to be used. Great product, and recommended.</li>
    <li> It gives a good shave. It&#x27;s shortcoming is that the electric connection falls out to easily. The product is worth the money.</li>
    <li> I owned this product for several months now. I can say that it does what is expected, but it has some features that avoids it to get 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The pop-up trimmer doesn&#x27;t get fixed to its position while in use. So, it gets retracted when you most need it.&lt;br /&gt;- Even though the shave is really good, I always end with some extra trimmer time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design is very very comfortable and I don&#x27;t care about the no battery issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I live outside of USA. I use to buy a lot of things from Amazon and this is the first time that something does not work properly. If I plug the shaver, it works, but as soon as I unplug it turns off. I did all the recommendations from the user manual to charge it the right way. This is the last time I&#x27;ll buy something in sale from Amazon.</li>
    <li> underpowered, doesn&#x27;t cut well. time wasted in ordering it and returning it.&lt;br /&gt;If it is by design, then resources are wasted in manufacturing it.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed to find out the razor was made in China.  The housing is cheap/flimsy.  The electric cord is too short, so that it keeps disconnecting from razor.  The trimmer does not work well.</li>
    <li> I have always used the Norelco razor and have found it to be superior to any others that I have tried.  I would recommend this razor to anyone.  My wife even likes it for her legs.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly, this gives me a very close shave. It compares with shavers that cost hundreds. I like the fact that it is corded so that I don&#x27;t have to worry about batteries going dead. The wall outlet is right next to my mirror, so I don&#x27;t have the complaint that the cord is too short as many have noted. Overall, very pleased.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t use an electric razor everyday the battery is never charged when you want it or the battery dies in a few years, so an electric razor without a battery is perfect. This is a good quality razor at a low price.&lt;br /&gt; The only drawback is that the cord is too short.</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I wanted. I use an electric razor only infrequently, but when I do I want it ready. The old battery powered one was generally run down and it finally quit charging. This razor works when I plug it in. Perfect! And it does a nice job.</li>
    <li> Nice shaver for the price; had no problems with irritation that some others mentioned. Gives me a clean, quick shave; I have a light beard. Was previously using a Panasonic shaver with floating head technology, which did not give me a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One item of note is that this model CANNOT be taken in the shower, as some other shavers in this line can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have heard that the best way to make the blades last is to NOT use a brush to clean them.</li>
    <li> Edited Review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this razor based on the positive reviews, I was needing an electric shaver,&lt;br /&gt;and tired of using a manual razor. Here is what I found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives:  Runs quiet, fits your hand well. Some reviews said the cord came out of the&lt;br /&gt;  razor too easily, I didn&#x27;t find this at all to be the case, however it&lt;br /&gt;  pulled easily out of the electrical socket itself, which I fixed by widening the two&lt;br /&gt;  prongs on the plug slightly. The razor is light weight and doesn&#x27;t get hot, at least too fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: When running it sounds \\&quot;rickety\\&quot;, like its not made well and may fall apart, but&lt;br /&gt;I believe thats the way its designed. May depend on how long you let your hair grow out.&lt;br /&gt;Initially, the razor didn&#x27;t give effective cutting and as others stated putlled several&lt;br /&gt;hairs out, which was very negative feeling.  And, the cord is too short. The cord is that stretchable type,&lt;br /&gt;but way too  short, contributing to it comming out of the socket or razor too easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;I learned was that you have to clean the razor about every 2 times you use it,&lt;br /&gt;at least for me, thats what changed everything.  It easily gets hairs clogged up in it, lessening&lt;br /&gt;the effectiveness of the cutting.  And you \\&quot;have to\\&quot; read the manual very closely to clean this shaver,&lt;br /&gt;or otherwise as they state, the cutting of the shaver has to be re-adjusted to you, i.e. more pulled&lt;br /&gt;hairs, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I cleaned this shaver, took all the little parts apart, and it worked perfectly...beautifully. Very&lt;br /&gt;effective and no putlled hairs.  If you have a heavy beard, you may need to clean it before your&lt;br /&gt;next shave.  But it cleans so well, its worth it.  I personally don&#x27;t shave every day, about oncere&lt;br /&gt;every 2 weeks.  With this caveat, I recommend this shaver.  Haven&#x27;t yet gone through the rigamarol of&lt;br /&gt;replacing the shaver head, costs, and so forth, owned it less than 4 months though.</li>
    <li> as i have bought these over the years quality has steadily fallen. flimsy plastic, barely shaves if 2 or 3 days of beard, difficult to clean. a blade is faster, easier, much better shave. I will never buy another norelco.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s great, cheap and works well at the same time. it&#x27;s really a bargain. if you are looking a cheap shaver, that&#x27;s it</li>
    <li> My husband has been using the Norelco brand shavers for years and always loved them.  He needed a new one and bought this one.  Though it has a stretchy type cord, the cord doesn&#x27;t stretch all that much and when it does it pulls right out of the shaver.  A longer, non stretchy cord would be better.</li>
    <li> It does the job.  Bought this for my fiance.  Yes, it can bite at times, but it does what it was bought for.</li>
    <li> It works great.  In fact it is twice as fast as my old Norelco which I got in 1972, also a corded razor.  I lost the sharpener that came with that one, so it was time to replace it.</li>
    <li> The razor works very well.  I had a similar one before, but cordless.  I would recommend cordless because you have to be close to the outlet and it pulls easily from the wall.</li>
    <li> This shaver is easy on one&#x27;s skin but does a good job of removing stubble.  It is much easier on my face than other shavers I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that the shaver is not cordless--I like not having batteries to worry about.</li>
    <li> This S haver Gives Me A Very Smooth Shave And Is Very Comfortable On The Skin. The Smoothest You Could Ever Get From A Shaver.</li>
    <li> Cord comes out easily.. little frustrating.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s good. :)</li>
    <li> Excellent seller...All very good!!</li>
    <li> Looked at a lot of Ladies&#x27; shavers. Ordered one. Was useless; difficult to position with straight line top, forcing one to go only in straight lines in one direction, and did a terrible job of cutting. Ordered this one, just used it on my legs with a 6foot extension cord (cord is spiral one, but short.) Fantastic, very pleased with first run attempt. The springy rotary head cutters are perfect for navigating calves, knees, ankles, etc. Does not nick. Leaves a smooth finish almost as close as a razor cut. Will never shave my legs in the bath, again. Got the corded, keep away from water one as it was the cheapest, but am sure the more expensive lithion ion, waterproof, ones work just as well if you must use foam or water, or do not want to be tethered to an extension cord and want to spend at least twice as much money, and three times as much if you don&#x27;t want to charge it for eight hours per forty minutes of use. By the way, the heads do not turn, themselves, as the cutting blades do under the heads. When I got the thing, the top with the heads was not seated properly, cutting discs inserted backwards, so obviously had to reassemble before it would work. Good practice for when I have to change out the heads, so no harm done. Very happy with this shaver.</li>
    <li> So recently I have been getting really lazy and decided to look for an electronic shaving system so I can cut down some time during the morning before I get out of the house. Since I had little to no knowledge on this topic, I decided to do some thorough research and at the end of the day majority recommended the Phillips Norelco series. Now the Norelco series is a huge collection but I am a person with average facial hair so I wasn&#x27;t looking for any high end shaving system, and so I started looking at the lower end models the Norelco series offered. To my luck, this product was being offered on sale by amazon and I thought to myself why not, so I purchased it. Now my first impression out of the box was \\&quot;wow\\&quot;, it is really well built with a very nice design on the body that enables the user to get a very comfortable grip. This shaver has three independent heads that move on their own, giving you a comfortable and clean shave. When done shaving, you can just take the top off and wash out all the hair, since it collects all the hair that it shaves, so your hair does not go all over the place which is a very neat concept. The blade of the razor are recommended to be replaced every 12 months, so they are very long lasting. The back of the product there is a pop out trimmer. The trimmer is very precise so it is a great addition. This product however is not rechargeable like the rest of the series and it requires to be plugged in. This can be a con for many but for me it is a positive because it enables me to leave it in my cabinet and I can take it out whenever I need to shave. Also, most wireless shavers tend to run low on power and accuracy when the battery is low but since this product is a plug-in, it will always provide full throttle giving you a great shave every time. Every morning it used to take me about 3-4 minutes to shave but now it takes me about 15-20 seconds. I am very glad I made this purchase and I highly recommend this to anyone contemplating on getting an electric shaving system. Hopefully I helped! please let me know if you have any comments or questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****UPDATED 12/11/2012****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of right now, I have been using this product on a regular basis since my purchase, which is about 3 weeks now. I have been getting really bad shave burns and it has been bad for my skin. I do not have sensitive skin but however to make sure, I changed the blades and let my father try it to see how he felt. After a couple of days he told me he was experiencing the same problems and that his skin was irritated after shaving and required a lot of after shave to heal up. It is still a good shaver, but I think it would be a better choice to invest a little more and get a higher end shaver from the norelco series, or a different one. I am sad to inform that I am going to be changing my original 5 star review to a 3 star.an electric shaving system.

    <li> I bought this as a gift for my Dad after his previous electric razor died. I bought it because it was the most similar to the old one. You know how older people dislike anything different from what they&#x27;re used to having. It was a success, and has been a gem ever since.</li>
    <li> Its ok but loses its power after a while. But for the price its ok. Not as good as the old style.</li>
    <li> I originally used a Remington that my parents bought me when I was about fourteen. It was corded and I used it for forty years.  only reason that I got a new shaver was I could no longer find heads for it anywhere. That shaver was a corded shaver and built really well. I then got a Remington rotary shaver that had batteries. The problem with that shaver is that after only fifteen years of use I could only get one shave out of every charge, and the shaver wouldn&#x27;t work on just the cord. This new Norelco shaver gives a good shave even though it seems to run a little slow for a corded shaver. It works fine, but I doubt that I will get forty years of use out of this shaver as it doesn&#x27;t seem as well made as my first Remington. Time will tell. I&#x27;ll get back to you with an update in forty years.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave perfectly. It always look like you have shaved only 3 days ago. I feel it doesn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
    <li> I would recomment this to anyone who appreciates a close, fast shave with a wired unit.  It is well-designed, lightweight and travels well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit, I didn&#x27;t read the description in it&#x27;s entirety. No battery, it has to be plugged in throughout use. It doesn&#x27;t give a grade A shave, but it WILL give you an instant 5 o&#x27;clock shadow. Good if you&#x27;re going for that Nathan Drake look at 5 AM. Hey, don&#x27;t judge, a guy needs all the help he can get.</li>
    <li> I like this shaver. I was leery of cordless shavers, because everyone I know complains about how short the battery life is. I make it a point to not shave when I&#x27;m on vacation, and most of the time when I travel, it&#x27;s for vacation, so I don&#x27;t mind the cord at home. Works great, and a bargain price.</li>
    <li> Motor is slow with little torque, yet the very sharp blades make up for the lack of power Decent price</li>
    <li> Cored shaver means you have to connect it to power if you use it. Plus, it feels so plastic and the color is not good. All in all, I am a little bit disappointed.</li>
    <li> This shaver does a good job, but has a &amp;#34;wimpy&amp;#34; sound because of the plastic case.  One design flaw: the button that releases the head for cleaning, has a glossy finish (so it&#x27;s hard to actuate with a thumbnail) &amp; a long enough travel that it&#x27;s hard to actuate with the flesh of a thumb--it should have a textured finish (at least, matte).</li>
    <li> This is nice shaver to buy.  Worth your money.  So go ahead and buy it.  You get a very smooth Shave!</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver specifically because it is corded (no battery).  Previously, I used a Braun 4005 foil shaver.  It was a plug-in without a battery also, and lasted for about 15 years.  I was going to replace it with another corded foil shaver, but I was not able to find any.  There are corded foil shavers out there, but they all have batteries as well, meaning they are dual-power.  I want the simplicity of a plug-in, without any batteries to go bad.  Corded-only shavers like this one are always at 100% power when you plug them in, plus you never have to charge them.  I have limited space, and don&#x27;t want to clutter up the counter while charging a shaver.  I pull it out of the drawer for a few minutes each morning to shave, and back in the drawer it goes!  This is my first rotary shaver, so it took a little getting used to.  It seems quieter than my Braun foil, and works better on my neck area.  I also like the pop-up trimmer for the sideburns.  I paid only $35 and got free shipping from Amazon.  All in all I am quite satisfied with this shaver.</li>
    <li> Fantastic buy.  I always buy Norelco because I have yet to have one stop working.  I tend to lose in strange circumstances, inappropriate for this review.  Of course the rotor replacements are always available...on Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> The product works fine and holds a charge the expcted time. I would prefer it to provide a little closer shave.</li>
    <li> It met my expectations, except I thought it was cordless I didnt realize I needed a cord in order for it to run</li>
    <li> I bought it because I got it in a deal.  I am getting rashes and cuts after the shave.  I was going to return it, but my son tried it and he wants to keep it.</li>
    <li> bought this for my husband he wanted an old fashioned razor with a cord so I went on line and found this one and it was a very reasonable price so I bought it and have been very pleased since. I would recommend to anyone who wants a razor with a cord.</li>
    <li> Norelco shaver is a good cheap razor love it:).&lt;br /&gt;Pedals are better than the stock in a specialized hard rock 29er. Been doing better than the stock ones. Love them and cheap.</li>
    <li> I wanted an electric razor for the mornings when I just didn&#x27;t feel like lathering up and I was running behind. The motor is strong enough to get the job done, blades plenty sharp, and you can get by for days using this and then go over your beard with a blade and lather. The price was reasonable, I&#x27;m not into paying over $100 for an electric razor as I consider these disposable commodities.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a  kind_of_like/hate relationship with electric shavers for a long time.  When I received this one I lifted it and noticed how light it was and thought it was cheaply made but remembered that there is no battery. When I turned it on it seemed like it was hardly rotating. I&#x27;m used to the razor sounding like a little orbital sander.  I thought there was something wrong with it and thought that I&#x27;d soon be going through the trouble of sending back a defective product.  Then....then I started to shave with it and voila, it did a great job.  I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> Good buy for the price.  Given as a gift</li>
    <li> Hubs loves this little baby.....it does just the trick for his neck (he has a beard and uses another product to trim that). Easy to use and reliable. He does not need to worry about cordless usage so that was never an issue. The outlet is close to the mirror so no probs there either.</li>
    <li> Apparently Norelco is moving away from corded razors. Too bad, they will lose my business when I can no longer get the corded model.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving for almost 50 years and have been very pleased with the corded Norelco razors- each has lasted over 10years. My beard grows at average lenth and coarseness. This razor seems to work as well as the older &amp;#34;made in holland&amp;#34; models  (new ones made in China). The newer models are sinificantly lighter in weigtht. Have had this model on a few months but so far so good. Only real complant with any of these corded models in the last 30 years is that in some models the cord has a tendency to become detached from the razor while shaving...but a drop of superglue or slicone rubber sealent does the trick. Very highly recommended</li>
    <li> I have owned a Remington shaver ever since I started shaving, about 40 years ago.  But, I became discouraged with Remington since they started making only rechargeable shavers a few years ago (other than the one-head cheapies).  The last two I owned died after only one year, and the only way to revive them was to mail them in to get a new battery.  The cost was as much as a new shaver, and I would have to buy another shaver to use while the thing was being repaired, so why bother?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I finally broke down and bought a Philips Norelco corded shaver.  It works.  It works very well.  It gets the whiskers under my nose and on my neck that the Remington always missed.  It&#x27;s not as close as a Remington, but it makes up for that in that I don&#x27;t have to go back over all the whiskers that it missed with the trimmer, any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bonus-- the cord that comes with it is too short, and it keeps coming out.  So, I thought, why not try the cord that I had from the old Remington?  Ha! Sure enough, it fits!  So, I got rid of the Norelco cord and I now use it with my old straight Remington cord.  Works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had rechargeable shavers before.  See above.  But, it was never charged enough to shave with (even after charging all night), so I always ended up using it with the cord anyway.  So, now I only go for the corded shavers.  No battery to die, and it always works just the way it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t as good as Norelco razors I have had in the past, but they all scrape my neck, and miss a lot of longer whiskers on my face.</li>
    <li> an inexpensive shaver  that is  perfectly adequate for the job of shaving....I do wish the cord was a foot longer...very good value for the money</li>
    <li> Had a Phillips Norelco for years which performed well, but since blades dulled decided on a new one. New Norelco not as good as old. Takes repeated applications to remove stubble and still not a smooth skin. Also, cord connection kept falling off shaver and head seems loose.</li>
    <li> This razor works well.  I don&#x27;t want a battery operated razor because I&#x27;ve had them before.  After you have had a battery/line cord razor for a while, and the battery runs down right when you need it in a hurry, it won&#x27;t even work when you plug it into the 120 volt line. and then it works when the battery is charged up.  With a corded only razor, you know it&#x27;s going to work when you plug it in and use it.</li>
    <li> this is my 4th Norelco very fast, close and comfortable.  I would buy it again. i think it is the best men&#x27;s shaving system i have ever used i am 78</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver because of the sale price on amazon. But this is a really bad shaver that seems to be designed to cut my skin. Am still in pain because of the cuts because of this shaver.</li>
    <li> I bought it as a gift.  It looks nice with the blue strip and I believe the receiver will like it too.</li>
    <li> PHILIPS should be ashamed of even putting there name on this shaver or even putting it on retail shelves will not stay plugged in and does not have enought rpm&#x27;s to shave pubic hairs.</li>
    <li> The plastic molding for the shaving head is of poor quality. This allows the blades to wobble and I get&lt;br /&gt;a lousy shave. I also get a reaction similar to razor burn, most irritating... My last venture with norelco...</li>
    <li> This shaver is seemingly &amp;#34;light duty&amp;#34; and I have a very heavy beard, so I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised by what nice close irritation-free shaves it gives me.  It&#x27;s very lightweight and makes almost no noise when it&#x27;s on.  Let&#x27;s hope I can say this same thing in a year or two (I&#x27;ve only had it for a few months).</li>
    <li> This is an extraordinary good product.  It does a great job for a small price. Would also recommend to others to purchase. Excellent</li>
    <li> Best electric razor I&#x27;ve owned.  Has a cord.  Doesn&#x27;t have needless crap.  Great price.  If you like simple tools that work pretty good this is for you.  I replace the heads annually.</li>
    <li> head was loose super cheap and weak for a plug in shaver lots of irritation a waste of money !</li>
    <li> One of the least expensive, but works surprisingly well.  I get the closest shave with this razor that I have had with any electric razor.  The method of collecting the shavings also much better than previous razors.</li>
    <li> When I bought this for my husband, I thought it was cordless(didn&#x27;t read real close), but even with the cord, it works great and shaves so close. Usually he hates corded shavers because they get tangled, but not this one. Very happy with this purchase and would buy it again.  Hope this helps you...</li>
    <li> I purchase this product for my husband and he is very pleased with it. The other reviews were very helpful to make my decision. I highly recommend the product to anyone who is looking for an affordable and practical shaver.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mainly because I wanted a corded shaver. All batteries fail after a while and I didn&#x27;t want to have to deal with soldering in new batteries after a couple years. I have had this razor for around three years and it has performed well the entire time. I have never had a bit of trouble with it the entire time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, I feel like I get a pretty mediocre shave with this. I feel like I really have to rub it around on my face to get everything cleaned up, and it has a tendency to have problems with the occasional whisker that doesn&#x27;t want to be shaved. The whining noise is pretty annoying too, but at least it isn&#x27;t super loud. The thing sounds wimpy but it seems to do the job. I have used it on some 3mm growth, so I really shouldn&#x27;t complain I guess. It just seems to take a long time and the end result is pretty average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing works, but I tend to only use it when I am in a hurry. So I haven&#x27;t used it every day for the last three years, more like once or twice a week. After shaving I just pop the top off, knock out the whiskers into the garbage can, snap the top back on, and replace the blade cover. I gather replacement blades cost more than the razor itself, but mine still seem sharp enough to cut adequately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So four stars. The price is good. Its battery-free. It has proven to be fairly reliable. It looks nice. I&#x27;m just not overly impressed with the shave quality, it is adequate but nothing exceptional. For the price, its a good deal though.</li>
    <li> I had a Norelco many years ago. Liked it but the batteries died. I picked up a different brand but it did not give as good a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to Norelco again. This is a corded unit only. No batteries to die. The motor seems slow but then it dawned on me that if it went faster the hairs would not have time to be picked up before being cut off. This gives an extremely close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price was extremely good. Amazon shipping top notch.</li>
    <li> NEW QUALITY STANDARDS? WOORSE THAN CHEAP, IT IS GARBAGE WHEN IT IS COMPARED TO OLDER PRODUCT QUALITY !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Power cord will not even stay connected to razor. Keeps pulling out... Does Norelco even meet old quality levels? NO! THOSE DAYS GONE FOREVER. SELL THE JUNK WHERE IT IS MADE, NOT HERE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why does an established Company like Norelco fail to meet their established standard and punish their existing customer base with China Garbage?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time to return this item and seek a return to basic quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dom A</li>
    <li> Very good electric razer for the price.I have been using it for three years now and have no complains. I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to purchase an other one  .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended to anyone.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my son.  While it works wonderfully, it did not last long.  He had it for less then a year and it was not trimming.  It already needs to be replaced.  I know they do wear out and given the price, didn&#x27;t expect a long last but under a year?  Disappointing.</li>
    <li> i got the norelco ,i like the design and it is doing what i want it to do want more can one want.....</li>
    <li> My husband loves shaver.  It cuts close and smooth.  Would recommend this product to anyone and a  Good price too</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an inexpensive version of their higher end models. It does the job but don&#x27;t expect longevity. For the occasional use between using a normal razor this does the job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for four years now.  Still works fine, but not quite as good as new. I have a really thick coarse beard, and these Norelcos that plug in are the best I&#x27;ve found for my type of face.  I don&#x27;t really like the cordless ones because I have to worry about charging them and then having the batteries get weak.  Easy to clean.  Doesn&#x27;t get clogged up as quickly as most razors.  Unless you have baby soft hair that&#x27;s easy to shave with a blade, this is about as close of a shave as you&#x27;re going to get.  Norelcos seem to be a little easier on your face than other brands, and much easier on your face than a blade.</li>
    <li> Good product for the price. No disappointment here. Arrived quickly and was exactly what I ordered.  Cheaper than buying new shaver head to replace a dull one.</li>
    <li> sounds like its a little under powered but it does the job really well. silent and still effective works great.</li>
    <li> This shaver only works with a cord, which for me is a positive, because there is no battery to go bad.  Some reviewers mentioned the cord popping out too easily. I agree that the retractable cord could have been made longer, but I have had the shaver for a week, and it has popped out only once (and it is easy to plug back in).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a thick beard, and I have found the shave to be nearly as close as with blades. The three spinning blades allow you to move the shaver in straight lines, or in a circular pattern, and this makes shaving easier than with the straight flex-head type electric shavers requiring movement in one direction.  It&#x27;s pretty easy to get a reasonably close shave with this shaver.  The pop-up trimmer works well on side-burns. Minor irritation became a non-issue for me by applying astringent or aftershave following a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spinning blades should be replaced once per year with Phillips HQ55 blades, at a cost of about $30, which is actually inexpensive compared to buying blades for manual shaving (Mach 3 blades are about $30 for fifteen blades).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line: Convenient, low cost shaving experience.</li>
    <li> Great shaver,very quite and light weight.My only gripe,I could not find any a/c electric shaver that was made in the USA</li>
    <li> My son likes the quietness of the shaver and the fact that he will never have to worry about replacing a battery. It gives him a nice close shave. The shipment was also prompt.</li>
    <li> I did not realize when I purchased this that this electric shaver was not cordless.  My bad.  But the cord does not stay in the socket, making for the worst shave ever.  Big big disappointment.</li>
    <li> I have had Norelco shavers since I first started to shave and I am 80 years old.  My overall experience with them has been excellent.&lt;br /&gt;A few months ago I thought I should have a cordless razor as most of my friends do and purchased one of the the $100 Noreco cordless types.  It was the poorest shaver  I have ever had.  Rather than cut the whiskers I just had to literally wear then off, taking 15 minutes or so amd ending up with a poor shave.  I decided to throw it away and go back to an inexpensive corded shaver. I have had this shaver about 3 months. I have never had a better shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver cuts extremely well and fast on all parts of my face and neck.  It is comfortable and does not irritate the skin.It is quick and easy to clean.  It clearly demonstrates the reason I have used Norelco shavers all my life.&lt;br /&gt;I would stronly recommend it to anyone who does not find it necessary to shave on the run.  It would be an excellent shaver for a young man just starting to shave, because it works!</li>
    <li> Just the quality you&#x27;d think it would be for $20-$30 (lots of plastic).&lt;br /&gt; But it is quiet and gives a fairly close shave and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> got this one on the lightning deal, works great and for what i paid i couldn&#x27;t be happier with it</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference between my old shaver (also a norelco) and the new one.  I guess the old blades got dull and I didn&#x27;t realize it.  This new one is fantastic.  I have had a norelco shaver since 1956.  I wouldn&#x27;t own another.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my 6940 for over a year. It is remarkably lightweight owing to the fact that there are no batteries inside. I like not having to mess around with batteries which eventually fail to hold a charge, turning your shaver into a little doorstop. This shaver is  much quieter than the Norelco I had back in the seventies; the pivoting heads are a big advantage and it gives a comfortable shave with little or no irritation. One minor disadvantage is that the cord sometimes pulls out of the shaver if you stretch it too much. When this happens you simply plug it back in and away you go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am completely rewiriting my review. After a failed experiment with pre-shave lotion, I cleaned the heads and blades in a small bowl of alcohol. After doing so, this razor actually shaves BETTER than new! It now gives a closer shave in less time and it gives a much better shave should you take a vacation from shaving for a couple of days. My theory is that they may use some kind of lubricant (perhaps a silicone-based lubricant similar to WD-40?) when the shaver is manufactured and the alocohol soak strips the heads and blades of this lubricant, resulting in a better shave. That&#x27;s just a theory, but it now gives a very good shave in very little time. That and the freedom from batteries make it a winner for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A side note: I tried the Walgreens pre-shave lotion which is similar to Williams Lectric Shave. It was pretty useless. One could almost faint from the fumes when applying it, and it did very little toward the betterment of the shave. I shaved five or six times with it and when I opened up the razor, the blades were caked with a residue of skin cells and whiskers. It took some effort to clean out this mess using the alcohol soak described above. Let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m none too keen on pre-shave lotions.esidue of skin cells and whiskers. It took quite some effort to clean out this mess. It&#x27;s clean now but let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;m none too keen on pre-shave lotions.</li>
    <li> The quality of this product is horrible. I thought I was getting something better and now that I want to return it, it looks like I still going to have to pay for shipment. I&#x27;ve been shopping on Amazon for a long time now, but I&#x27;m thinking on going back to Wal-Mart since I wouldn&#x27;t pay for shipping when returning something there.</li>
    <li> First of all, this shaving system doesn&#x27;t clean the beard. Second, it takes 3X time of the razor to shave. I thought it would save me some time, but NO. Third, it may injures you. You have to be very careful. The back side trimmer is totally horrible. It can NOT shave any beard shorter than 0.5cm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t work for me ;( Waste of money</li>
    <li> The cord keeps coming out of the product when you are using it.  The shaver shaves good if you can keep the cord in.  The cord is to loose in the shaver.</li>
    <li> My husband loves his new razor.  He did NOT want one of the rechargeables because they don&#x27;t last.  This one works great and gives him the close shave he wants.</li>
    <li> I like it but it is a bit underpowered.  It is one of the best razors from Norelco I have owned and it does not pull the hairs, but the drawback is the slow cut speed</li>
    <li> 110v not 220v&lt;br /&gt;Not anble to charge .&lt;br /&gt;Only in electronic .&lt;br /&gt;If you removed it will stopped suddenly .</li>
    <li> It was purchased as a mistake (My bad) as I should have read it more carefully.  I actually wanted a cordless (rechargeable) shaver.</li>
    <li> I compared this item with various stores out of curiousity, and found the online price and guaranty was by far the best. Amazon in some cases was not the cheapest price, but I trust them and exclusively deal with because of bad experiences with other providers. This shaver is very quiet and works well. I should have bought two of them because the price is cheaper then replacing the cutting heads.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize plug-in-only electric shavers were still being sold. Was disappointed. I guess the product description said CORDED, but I missed it. Other than that, it is a good shaver.</li>
    <li> ok this gives a close shave when you can keep the head on..if you take the head off to clean it it is a royal pain in the but to get back on..the head design is terrible..$35 bucs for this is not worth it..i am on the verge of sending it back..no matter what i do the head will not snap back into place..</li>
    <li> This is a great product. KISS (Keep It Simple and Stupid) designed shaver. Not too many buttons, no need for LCD.&lt;br /&gt;Not too many things to break down.&lt;br /&gt;Has a powerful motor that ensures the performance is not limited by the age/type of a battery.&lt;br /&gt;If the motor is not burned, it will last forever, just replace the shaving head.&lt;br /&gt;It is also better for the environment as there are no batteries involved.&lt;br /&gt;I had several machines before, all had batteries. The were all tossed out at the end, due to battery performance.&lt;br /&gt;The performance I get today and 5 years from now is going to be the same.&lt;br /&gt;It works on 110-240v so I can take it with me when I travel overseas.&lt;br /&gt;Provides all the functionality I need from a shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me it is a no-brainer... Buy it.</li>
    <li> Purchased on sale for around $20.00 works well just not rechargeable great for home use and trimmer is added bonus.</li>
    <li> This was perfect for my 18 year old...he charges it and uses it daily ....it was a great price and free shipping !! You cant beat it . This is a higher end razor and he loves it !!!</li>
    <li> Just about 5 years later and still using it.  Now I&#x27;m not an everyday shaver because I am lazy and my skin doesn&#x27;t like being shaved.  But this does a decent job and it doesn&#x27;t rough up my skin too much.  The blades are starting to get dull but replacements at this point are pretty expensive.  It is impressive I&#x27;ve been using this for that long doing minimal cleaning on it and without changing blades and i can still get a decent shave.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY HUSBAND. HE SAYS IT IS GOOD WORKING WHEN HE DOES NOT WANT  TO SHAVE IN THE SHOWER.</li>
    <li> I think I wrote the review for the replacement blades thinking it was the razor. I have had this a couple of years and it has done well.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my son and he loves it. Excellent value for the money. He&#x27;s had it for 6 months and has no issue with it.</li>
    <li> This product exceeded my expectations. The best shaver  I&#x27;ve every had. I recommend this product to everyone out there. Totally Awesome.</li>
    <li> would like to find out how to return, it does not seem to have enuf power strength. maybe defective? dont know.woud like to return for a money back situation if i can find out how</li>
    <li> This is a basic razor that gets the job done. I recommend this product. It does not use batteries and must be plugged in to use but it works well and costs much less than a set of replacement blades.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t feel proper on my neck or face creates a lot of razor burn and isn&#x27;t smooth as I expected</li>
    <li> Gr8 Product&lt;br /&gt;100% Sure Value for Money&lt;br /&gt;I have been using for last 6 months.. Its working gr8..&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to every one.</li>
    <li> doesnt clean well at all good for emergencies a blade is much better. i always use my blade when i need it close</li>
    <li> I bought this coded saver because the rechargeable shaver I had wouldn&#x27;t hold it&#x27;s charge or work even when plugged into outlet. This coded shaver doesn&#x27;t have to deal with running off the battery. the shaver supports power from 110v and 220v outlet. You need a foreign plug adapter to the US plug. There is no switch to move on shaver to tell which power source voltage is being applied, the user guide says this is transparent.  The shaver runs at full speed and shaves well. I have a light facial hair growth and do not get a midday shadow. The cutters are supposed to be changed once a year. There is also a pop up side trimmer on the shaver.</li>
    <li> This is my first shaving thing, so I thought they&#x27;ll work better. Anyway, It&#x27;s ok, I like it. Excellent price, by the way !!</li>
    <li> As others have said this shaver does an acceptable job, nothing great.  Okay for the price.  It&#x27;s a shame Norelco won&#x27;t put its best technology in a corded shaver.</li>
    <li> I happen to love Amazon Prime and make it work for me a lot!  Deals like this one make it worth the price each year.  My husband likes the razor so we are all happy</li>
    <li> WELL I SHOULD OF know that you get what you pay for this is a total waste of money ,there is one speed only that is super slow ,the cord is very short ,so if you dont have a close plug by minnor ,you will have to bend over to shave ,over and over and over to get a clen shave ,it almost like its a toy</li>
    <li> The Picture and description did not show clearly about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a corded razor. Be aware of that ...</li>
    <li> It is a great bargain.  I bought one for my husband years ago and he is still using it. Great quality too.</li>
    <li> I find that this is a very good shaver and I have been purchasing Norelco shavers for a number of years. I have tried other brands in the past but always come back to Norelco. I hope they&#x27;re quality continues down the road.</li>
    <li> Cuts very well for the money. No complaints.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver during a \\&quot;Gold Box\\&quot; deal at a very good price.  I wasn&#x27;t exactly looking for a new shaver, but, at the price, it was well worth trying.  Being retired, I don&#x27;t always shave every day.  Being unshaven, my wife doesn&#x27;t always like me as much every day.  Anyway, I can always use a blade or my old Norelco.  Bladewise, the blade companies have continued to increase the technology and the cost - two blades, three blades, vibrating blades, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My old Norelco works but not so good after several days of growth.  It not only takes longer to shave, it seems like I&#x27;m scrubbing off my face, especially under my chin.  I probably need new cutters for this shaver but I didn&#x27;t know what this would cost.  So, I ordered this product even though it was \\&quot;corded\\&quot; whereas my old Norelco was not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is extremely lightweight.  Surprisingly, it did a very good job on a three day beard.  It was quick and close and did a good job under my chin where the hairs seem to grow at different angles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What seems to have happened is that razor blade replacements have gone up in price and shaver prices have decreased.  It may soon be, or already be, cheaper to replace the shaver than buy replacement blades for your razor!  I&#x27;m completely satisfied with this shaver except for - the cord is too short for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Depending upon where your outlet is, the length may be okay or not.  For me, it was too short and I had to use one hand on the shaver and the other hand on the cord (to stretch it).  Still, the shaver is a good buy.  I would just like to have a longer cord and that is why I gave this shaver 4 stars instead of 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited 7/30/2013 to downgrade by one star because of the short cord.  I just can&#x27;t stand it anymore so I ordered replacement heads for my old cordless Norelco.  These cost more than this Phillips shaver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having to hold the cord in one hand gets very old after awhile.  Sometimes, the cord will pull out of the shaver since it gets too tight when stretching it to get to the opposite side of my face.  And then, because of the cord, I can&#x27;t easily see all parts of my face which makes clean shaving more difficult than it should be.l out of the shaver since it gets too tight when stretching it to get to the opposite side of my face.  And then, because of the cord, I can&#x27;t easily see all parts of my face which makes clean shaving more difficult than it should be.</li>
    <li> replaced a rechargeable norelco with this one and can&#x27;t believe how much better. when i first used it thought there was something wrong because it is so much quieter, really...the old one also wouldn&#x27;t work unless it was charged which meant I had to plug it in a couple hrs. before using, what a pain.  this one shaves a lot closer although that might be just the difference in age.&lt;br /&gt;unless you want to shave driving or something weird you won&#x27;t go wrong here.</li>
    <li> This razor is has extremely thin heads and very sharp blades. Its quite and a handy size.&lt;br /&gt;It does the job with no problems.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re like me, waking up in the morning, the last thing you want to do is lather up some soap and fumble at your face with a razor..I&#x27;m tired. I want to sleep.  The Philips Norelco 6940 has worked great.  I can shave after my shower and not have a 5o&#x27;clock shadow by the end of the day.  It&#x27;s an easy clean up..just shake the hair out of the catch compartment . I&#x27;ve used it nearly everyday and have had no problems.  For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it. You spend that much a month in good quality razors.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good razor. Very quiet and easy to grasp.&lt;br /&gt;My friend really likes this!&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest this to my friend without any hesitation!</li>
    <li> Just got this thing, frankly the price was the determining factor. It cuts every bit as close as a razor. Some reviews said something about the chord length, but its long enough as most people probably have an outlet within reasonable proximity to the bathroom mirror. Thirty bucks well spent.</li>
    <li> This shaver is amazing, it feels like a massage to my face, not shaving my face!!  Glad I found it!  I love Norelco!</li>
    <li> This product has failed, very disappointing.  It is not cutting the face hair anymore, after a few uses. I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> The brand stick on its performance, however, I found it to light for the purpose or action it supposes to perfom</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband as a back-up shaver. The price was excellent. When he received it, he started using it all the time. The case is light, almost flimsy, but seems sturdy. The only issue is that the cord is coiled so tight that it sometimes pulls out of the outlet.  He is happy with the shave quality.</li>
    <li> works fine.  I can sleep and shave at once.  a nice progression from their older razors.  fairly easy to clean</li>
    <li> Been using for 3 years now.  I love the power of a \\&quot;plug in\\&quot; better than a recharging.  Shaves very close and does not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that it is not chargeable because all other shavers have not charged up enough to shave properly</li>
    <li> Because everyone has different thickness of hair and skin, I will try to describe mine:&lt;br /&gt;(Disregard this review if you&#x27;re hair is different)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have blond hair that&#x27;s not extremely thick, but not thin either, I didn&#x27;t start shaving until I was 19, and now that I&#x27;m 24 I only shave every couple of days. That being said, I don&#x27;t have a thick beard trying to burst out of my skin every second, but I do have a sensitive neck and get razor burn there any time I use a 3, 4 or 5 blade razor. My skin just can&#x27;t handle it. My face doesn&#x27;t break out, but my neck is painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I thought I&#x27;d switch to an electric razor to see if that would help. I thought it did at first, but the blade dulls quickly and if I made more than one pass on my neck it would get a razor burn. I could shave my face all day long with the electric razor and it felt fine. I never got a really close shave, but it was nice for the convenience of literally taking 30 seconds to shave my face without any mess. Still though, I was unsatisfied with the electric razor causing the rash on my neck and so I tried out Safety Razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first heard about them, I thought it would be the same as using the standard 3-5 blade razors, boy was I wrong. I got a cheap badger hair brush, the Proraso sensitive skin shaving cream, an old safety razor (1942 Gillette) off of ebay and some Derby blades. NO MORE RASH. It takes a few times with the razor to learn how to hold it, but you don&#x27;t run near the risk of getting a rash with it because it&#x27;s just a single blade. I also don&#x27;t worry about cutting myself with it. All in all it cost me about $30 to buy a new way of shaving and never worry about a rash again.</li>
    <li> Its really hurting I stopped using it after 1st use. It is not worth of money don&#x27;t buy it. I got back to shaving using razor.</li>
    <li> It got to me when they said it wood and it was just what it was supposed to be ,I was happy</li>
    <li> I wish you could shave without having it plugged in, but I knew that prior to buying.  It was on sale, so I bought it.  Good for what it is-an inexpensive razor that shaves decently without bumps or pulling.  Can&#x27;t truly complain.</li>
    <li> All ok, as expected, new in box and helpful to me, I will continue to watch for other products may interest me!</li>
    <li> Received this for Christmas and it works well.  Nice close shave.  I would highly recommend this item.  Nothing bad to say about it.</li>
    <li> The shaver works well and is worth the price. I already had one but discovered that a replacement head cost more than a new shaver did.  Go figure.</li>
    <li> This shaver has a nice compact size, since there&#x27;s no batteries in the handle. The cord length works good for me, but if your used to walking around with a cordless you will need an extension cord.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my dad. He likes it and uses it all the time. I think it&#x27;ll last a long time. Good quality.</li>
    <li> when I first switched it on my first reation was that the motor sounds whimpy, leaving me wondering if the shaver will do its job. Then I realised it actually does a very clean shave. Unlike my previous singel head Braun, the cuttings are kept inside the head &amp; do not spill all over the countertop. The diminitive size takes a bit of getting used to, but again it does an adequate job. I have rather light beard growth, so I cannot comment for consumers who may have thicker &amp; denser beard. For the low price it is offered, the time offers incredible value.</li>
    <li> This shaver works well and it is nice to have one that just has a simple power cord that&#x27;s it.  No charging of batteries.  Just plug it in and shave.  Gives very smooth shave</li>
    <li> It is a gift and hope he likes it. didn&#x27;t use it . my dear little brother and my dear good friends.</li>
    <li> Purchased it for my husband for a Christmas gift. He is very pleased with it. It is exactly what he wanted</li>
    <li> I am impressed with the close shave compared to the old electric shaver I was using. I like that it is corded only and not the rechargeable type.</li>
    <li> I love this razor because it is so simple. Plug it in. Shave, trim, done! I hate batteries and constantly having various devices all over the house being charged. Only once or twice in the past 10 years have I been without an AC outlet to plug in my shaver. But in the outback, who cares? Nobody!</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco shaving product for so many years and still buying its product when needed. This shaver run very smooth and very sharp. The only thing you have to plug it in electrical outlet when using it. It is not a battery charged product.</li>
    <li> Not bad at all for a cheap electric shaver. Gives me a close, razor like shave anytime I want. The plug in vs rechargeable battery is probably why it is so inexpensive. But if like most people you have a plug right by where you shave it&#x27;s no problem.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good product .cheap,conveniency.I like it.It&#x27;s electric saving.&lt;br /&gt;It is convient for use and price is cheap . Style is beautiful.</li>
    <li> good. with high quality. easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I personally need it at the time.&lt;br /&gt;I feel pretty comfortable on it.</li>
    <li> Over more than 70 years, I have used several types of shavers.  When my old Norelco wore out (after more than 20 years0, I got this one.  It must be true that they have refined heads.  For speed, smoothness, and thoroughness, this one is a significant step UP.</li>
    <li> been using Norelco shavers for years. as long as you stick to the corded models like this one, they are a great value. last forever although you can simply throw them away after a few years and replace them, since the blade/head replacement is usually almost as much as a entirely new razor. I got about eight years out of my last one without replacing the head/blades. but shave gets pretty weak after that amount of time. while the build quality has gone waaaaay down over the years, virtually all plastic now and motor power is greatly reduced, they still work great. get a very close shave with this model. it is comfortable and quieter than earlier models.</li>
    <li> No need to ever recharge or replace batteries. This shaver will last forever. It is ridiculous to pay a hindred dollars for the same shave as a rechargeable unit.</li>
    <li> i like a little growth on my face so I use the trimmer on the side and that works great,but if you have some extra gowth of beard on your face the 3 cutting disc pull on your extra growth,but it will cut and give an good shave.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, especially for its price. If you need something that does the job but does not cost you a fortune, this is it. pretty easy to maintain as well. Should last a while</li>
    <li> I did not figure out from the add that it had no battery-  if that&#x27;s what you want it&#x27;s fine-&lt;br /&gt;not sure of the price point for a wired Norelco?</li>
    <li> Works great and I got mine for $20 and it gives me a close shave without pulling the hairs.  I love it!</li>
    <li> See above comment. Get what you pay for. Not strong at all and pulls hairs if they are some what long. Spend a little more money and get a decent electric shaver!</li>
    <li> I feel like some guys fare better with electric shavers than others. This one always irritated my skin and never seemed to shave that close. I finally just went back to using a razor and am happy that way.</li>
    <li> so the only reason i got this, is because it was one of the lightning deals that day. it was like ten bucks off so i was like what the hay ive never tried and electric razor before. so first off my skin is real sensitive. plus since i have a bit of acne my skin needs to be shaved gently. so when i got it i was surprised, it actually has a cord. but i guess thats a good thing since batteries arent cheap. but alright so this razor does give a close shave. you have to run it a couple times in order to get everything. the head does get a little warm but its not a problem. i just stopped using it cause my face gets bad razor burn after. it says its gonna take at least a month for my face to get used to but im just gonna stick to manual shaving. id say try it out, especially for the price</li>
    <li> I got this on a lightening deal for basically the price of replacement heads.. So my review is biased by the low price.  Would I pay full retail for this?  nope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had other norelco&#x27;s in my life, and was never impressed with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However.  I do like this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ergonomics and form factor enables this easy to get a close shave no matter how odd shaped your face is.. my head is a pumpkin with odd surfaces, and this thing really gets all the angles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also this does not make a mess of the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rubberized gripping is a big improvement over my Dad&#x27;s norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If only the heads were cheaper I would be alot happier with it.</li>
    <li> I do not like battery operated anything, the battery dies and you end up not being able to get replacements any more.  Gives a great shave, fantastic price, quick delivery, and I wanted to get some replacement heads, but the heads were so overpriced, it was just more for your money just to buy another Norelco 6940, so I did, from the same place again, and it arrived in 2 days again.  Processed quick and out the door the same day, and I got it 2 days later.  Used a old Norelco for 40 years, like the way the whole head contours to your face now.</li>
    <li> Great razor! I like it! I have used Norelco for years and always have been pleased with them. Thank you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
    <li> It works pretty good, a decent razors but the only problem is that since its not wireless, its hard to shave sometimes because the cord isn&#x27;t long enough but stretch it out for better results.</li>
    <li> it is the same as the dealer described. I am very happy to buy this. I will often go to this shop to buy things.</li>
    <li> So far so good with few complaints. It is a corded raiser which I like because it saves me the hassle of worrying about batteries. A good close shave and powerful enough for my use.</li>
    <li> It shaves close and without very much irritation.  Only objection is that it is not cordless.  I knew that before ordering.</li>
    <li> this one is great for the price. Easy to clean out and lighter than the rechargeable ones I am used to.</li>
    <li> This shaver is inexpensive for a reason. I thought I didn&#x27;t need a battery powered shaver, but turns out the curly power cord makes it a real pain, especially if your nearest plug isn&#x27;t right next to the sink and mirror. Other than that, it shaves my face, which is what I bought it for. I think I&#x27;ll look for a power cord that isn&#x27;t pigtail-curled for it, that&#x27;ll help.</li>
    <li> Whenever you use it, I need to find an AC power to plug in. It is not mobilable, at lease at this sense. It is not so smooth as a more expensive Philips electronic Razor, but consider its cheap price, it is just find.</li>
    <li> You can&#x60;t beat this one for the price. It does everything the most expensive one does but less than half the price. You will be ahead of the game with this shaver. The last one I had lasted me over 20 years and all I did was sharpen the cutters now and then.And it still works all it needs is a new blade.</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco 6940 Reflex Action Men&#x27;s Shaving System arrived quickly, was a great price, and was exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> GREAT VALUE FOR THE COST AND DOES AN EXCELLENT JOB I would buy this product again given the cost point</li>
    <li> 100% plugin.  Just the way I want it.  The system is light and cuts pretty good.  It feels like it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of torque, but it cuts well.  No batteries a major plus.  I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> Plug comes right out of the bottom while shaving.</li>
    <li> For more years than I like to think about, I&#x27;ve used an electric razor every other day.  It could have been every day but despite advertisers&#x27; claims, I never found one that shaved as close as a blade-- until now.  Powering the razor from the AC mains is probably more expensive than a rechargeable battery, but the speed is constant and the design of the heads is such that you can get a very close, even shave.  At a time when cartridge razor makers are insisting that you need more and more blades, it&#x27;s refreshing to see a product that pretty much gets back to the basics.  The cord is stiff when new, so I popped it out a couple times before figuring out that you can \\&quot;pre-stretch\\&quot; it a bit.  I&#x27;ve heard that replacing the cutters annually as Norelco suggests is an expensive proposition, but IF they need replacing in a year, and are that expensive,  I will consider buying a new razor-- the whole thing cost about the same as a year&#x27;s worth of multiblade cartridges.  Bottom line-- if you have been disappointed by electric razors in the past, try this one.</li>
    <li> I had a Norelco similar to this for over 20 years without a problem.  Used it daily from the time Christmas I got it as a gift when I still lived with my parents all the way until this past January.  It probably would have lasted many more years, but we were on a trip to Ireland and I plugged it in using just an adaptor without a voltage converter.  Fried the poor thing!  Anyway, this new one is performing just as good and is quieter than the old one.  The only reason I’m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that occasionally the power cord will loosen from it just enough to cut off the power and I have to push it back in again.  I don’t remember if the old cord plugged in deeper than this one or not, but now I just give it a push before shaving each time.  Still, definitely recommend this as an everyday shaver that will probably last for decades.</li>
    <li> I have had a couple of Norelco electric razors in the past both of which were the rechargable battery style. It seems over time battery life got shorter between charges to the point you had to keep it pluged in all the time. With the electric only razor the speed is always the same and can be stowed in the draw when not in use. The only negative is the cord length is a bit short.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been really happy with this razor.  It&#x27;s corded, so you&#x27;re not going to wander off too far while using it - but if you&#x27;re standing there staring into the mirror trying to stay awake while you shave, this should work just fine.  It cleans out easy and makes shaving in the morning pretty mindless - which is pretty much what I need.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s bargain you shouldn&#x27;t miss brand like Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;Solid, last long, good design, etc.&lt;br /&gt;BTW, it&#x27;s not cordless. Since I&#x27;ve two cordless, I wanted to have this one.</li>
    <li> Works better than my rechargeable Norelco and I&#x27;ll never have to replace batteries, which required soldering. Also costs about a 1/3 of the price.</li>
    <li> Arrived with a bad power cord -- I suppose I could return the unit, but I&#x27;m going to try to find my old one to swap it out. Also, I&#x27;m not sure if the blades on this model are of a lower quality than other more expensive models, but they don&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d like. Nevertheless, I continue to buy this model and treat it as a disposable razor (after 1 1/2 - 2 yrs of use), which is sad, but the blade replacement cost is almost the same as buying a new razor. Also, I don&#x27;t like the rechargeable models -- they&#x27;re much more expensive, and their blades AND rechargeable batteries wear out, necessitating replacement. The fact that they don&#x27;t function, even when plugged in, if the rechargeable batteries have failed, is absolutely ridiculous. Planned obsolescence at its finest. Norelco, are you listening? Give me a plug-in model with long lasting, higher grade blades and a cord that works. I&#x27;m seriously considering buying a good blade and some shaving cream.</li>
    <li> Due to the rising cost of Fusion razor blades, I decided to try this razor. I bought it on sale at Amazon for roughly the cost of one pack of Fusion refills. I use it daily and while it doesn&#x27;t get quite as close as the fusion, the difference is negligible. I was pleasantly surprised at the closeness of the shave. It&#x27;s handy, quick, doesn&#x27;t require battery recharging.</li>
    <li> My hubby used a rechargeable razor for years. This razor was &amp;#34;just what the doctor ordered&amp;#34; so to speak. No more charging or at the least trying to figure out when it needed to be charged, It shaved great on the first use and has continued to do so.</li>
    <li> this was for my husband and he loves it.........says it does the job and its light weight.  We will definately buy again when needed.</li>
    <li> Does the job.  No problem</li>
    <li> After using this product , I feel the joy early humans must have felt on discovering fire! Amazing! No skin irritation, no cuts, and no use of shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I regret that I didn&#x27;t buy this earlier. I bought this product to test this new method of shaving, and I absolutely love it. I am not going back now.</li>
    <li> The razor works okay. It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a safety razor. The plug keeps falling out. It was okay for the money.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift, looks nice in the box, and according to the spec&#x27;s has alot of nice options!  I think it makes a great gift for that guy on your Santa list!</li>
    <li> FAULTY ON/OFFSWITCH!!!!&lt;br /&gt;NO BRUSH!!!&lt;br /&gt;and not good shaving.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to try after 10 years another electric shaving system and I choose something cheap and I failed.</li>
    <li> Works great and for a great price.  No need to fool around with recharging. Plug it in and you&#x27;re always good to go.</li>
    <li> Purchased this shaver to replace my grandfather&#x27;s worn out one for a Christmas gift.  He specifically requested one that was not rechargeable.  This shaver had a great price and is not complicated to use.</li>
    <li> My bf said for a long time that he wanted an electric razor of his own. I bought this for him knowing that he wouldn&#x27;t be able to take it into the shower but I figured that it would be a better razor over all because he wouldn&#x27;t have to keep replacing batteries to keep the blades rotating fast enough to actually get a good shave. He never used so I tried it once so leave a decent review. It works alright but I prefer a really good disposable razor to this electric one. It took much longer to get a close shave with it and it didn&#x27;t cut as close. Though he was very happy with it at first he has since changed his mind. It is worth paying what I did for it.</li>
    <li> A christmas gift that was well received. Previous shaver had stopped working after 15 years. Norelco should go another 10-15 years!!</li>
    <li> This shaver does an excellent job on my face, and is very quiet in operation. It&#x27;s light-weight, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about re-charging capabilities. The side-burn trimmer is excellent for side-burns, and for temporal hair.  The price is right, and I usually buy two at a time, as it is cheaper this way than buying replacement heads.</li>
    <li> Works well.  I got tired of replacing expensive battery powered models.&lt;br /&gt;The main drawback is a very short coiled cord.  Works much better when&lt;br /&gt;you pair it with a 3 foot extension cord.</li>
    <li> I should have read the reviews on this one.  Cord is way too short and keeps coming unplugged while shaving and I am not that far away from the outlet.  Waste of money.  Wish I would have bought a rechargeable!!!</li>
    <li> This product feels really light.  Much lighter than the rechargeable version.  I shaved with it just fine after letting the stubble grow for 2 or three days.  No issues, and I&#x27;ve not needed to follow up with a blade.  So, its working as advertised.  I don&#x27;t see a drawback to the plug-in only model.</li>
    <li> I was really skeptical when I first bought this. I used to use one a while back, and loved it but it had been years since. The first time I used it, I hated it. It says if you&#x27;re used to razors it could take 3 weeks for it to get used to your skin. I figured I would try for the three weeks just to see, and they&#x27;re right! It was an awful shave the first time, not close barely did anything...by three weeks it was a lot closer of a shave. Now it took even longer (quite a few months) but now it works great. I&#x27;m a girl, and I get really bad razor burn, so you don&#x27;t have to be a guy to use this. I don&#x27;t get razor burn when I use this. I really do like it. It was totally worth the cheap price, but doesn&#x27;t look cheap. I don&#x27;t like the cord though, it is really short and comes out of the razor/or wall really easy. I stretch it out every time I use it, and that helps. Over all, a good find. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> quick cheap priced high quality replacement shaver, nothing negative to say about it its a great product, highly recommended, awesome</li>
    <li> my very first electric shaving system.. all though very basic and you can&#x27;t clean the blades under while .. who cares? this shaver works... that&#x27;s all i really care about ... you will need to go back and forth once or twice but still works ..</li>
    <li> A better than average product. More quality than shavers twice the cost. Compact for travel bags. Would recommend it to anybody</li>
    <li> ALL DAY I USE IT AND HAVE A WONDERFUL AND QUICK RAZOR. NORELCO IS A MUST FOR ME......ALL OK &amp; ECONOMICAL USE</li>
    <li> Works really well but I was disappointed to find it was made in China. That&#x27;s a new low for Philllips.</li>
    <li> This gives a good shave.  I wish I had noticed it&#x27;s not rechargeable.  I haven&#x27;t had to stay plugged in for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;My fault for not noticing.  It&#x27;s a good product but not for me.</li>
    <li> I messed up as I thought it was cordless.  What a pain to have to shave only at a receptacle  location!  Shave is decent and it works on both 110 and 220V.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for someone who never used an electric razor. He has said every time he&#x27;s used it, his face gets agitated. I&#x27;m not sure if it is because he&#x27;s new at this type of razor or the razor itself but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it for any other person just in case it was the fault of the razor.</li>
    <li> Norelco is cheapening its name selling this china knockoff as a Norelco product .It is nowhere near as good as my old shaver .</li>
</ol>
