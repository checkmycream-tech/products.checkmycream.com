      <li>Great Product!  </li>
      <li>and I love it!!!</li>
      <li>This shaver has a very good battery life compared to others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>Then, in a brilliant move from the marketing department, they sell this lack of sophistication as a feature by calling it the \\&quot;power boost\\&quot; feature.</li>
      <li>Great product that gives real good results.  </li>
      <li>If you buy, I hope you are as happy with it as I was and thank you for taking the time to read my review.</li>
      <li>and it works great.</li>
      <li>You will be happy</li>
      <li>Adjusting the trim you want at the touch of a button works great and is an great option that sets this trimmer apart from the others.</li>
      <li>This was a welcome change to the flimsy guards I have grown accustomed to.&lt;br</li>
      <li>what it is, though, it&#x27;s well-made and has great features.</li>
      <li>The Mangroomer is a really great grooming product.  </li>
      <li>worked great for 1 month then stopped working just after you could no longer return for refund/replacement.  </li>
      <li>It would be a great feature - if it</li>
      <li>Besides that this groomer is great.  </li>
      <li>It also works great for my chest hair.  </li>
      <li>The customer service before was great.</li>
      <li>It is a great product for what it is intended to do.</li>
      <li>and this would be a great product.</li>
      <li>A very nice feature if you are used to having to switch out guards on a trimmer.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve ever purchased over the years and if this one breaks, I&#x27;ll be sure to buy another one from mangroomer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>my honest opinion, this trimmer would have a perfect 5 star score from me if it had:&lt;br /&gt;-Standard USB cable charging - Very important to me.</li>
      <li>I like the two to three day feel and look, so for me the 2.5 mm setting works good.</li>
      <li>The \\&quot;whisker belly\\&quot; in the Mangroomer catches some of the whiskers, but doesn&#x27;t do nearly as good a job as the Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>You know what a good trimmer does, like the ones made by Braun?</li>
      <li>I bought this because of the reservoir for holding shaved hair, which worked fairly well.</li>
      <li>The good news is that this is one of the closest shaving trimmers I&#x27;ve ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The blades cut hair fairly well until I got to my neck where it pulled my hair and cut me.  </li>
      <li>Does a good job shaving.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a fairly flimsy unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Works good for me as a trimmer for beard and mustache , but when you try cut longer hair got litlle problems</li>
      <li>If you want something that will give you that look, this is a good choice.  </li>
      <li>Not the greatest trimmer but not bad either.  </li>
      <li>This is a great quality trimmer, it trims my goatee with ease and precision,&lt;br /&gt;It is even better than my trusty Conair trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It works great for the &amp;#34;stubble&amp;#34; look - much better than another man groomer product I have.  </li>
      <li>The lcd display for the settings is great and easy to use.  </li>
      <li>as for the \\&quot;power boost\\&quot; feature: this is actually a great example of the limitations of the cheaply made product being sold as a \\&quot;feature\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>Tried it in all the functions it can deliver and the results were nice and efficient.</li>
      <li>It saves on storage area as well when you don&#x27;t need to keep all the guards handy.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Lastly, it would be nice to have a stand for the trimmer.</li>
      <li>I also do not like that for the money it does not come with a nice charging stand -</li>
      <li>Fell apart within weeks and on top of it didn&#x27;t do a good job.</li>
      <li>and it does a good job of catching most of them.  </li>
      <li>It promises the perfect stubble look, precision, and a whisker belly to reduce cleanup but doesn&#x27;t really deliver.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It does the mustache area very nicely and gets a clean trimming around the nose area.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It also has \\&quot;Power Burst\\&quot; button, that give is more shaving power for thicker/coarser hair, Tim Allen from Home Improvement would have loved that \\&quot;more power\\&quot; addition to this device!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I know it&#x27;s not meant for that, but it would be nice to have more</li>
      <li>He so far is very happy with it&#x27;s trimming capabilities.</li>
      <li>I laughed when I opened the belly after a full-beard trim to find the chamber almost completely clean-</li>
      <li>Had I not previously owned two Norelco beard trimmers, I would have been more impressed with the Mangroomer.</li>
      <li>The plastic on the device is very cheap and I would not recommend this product for that reason.</li>
      <li>I like the fine adjustments in length that it allows, which is why I purchased it, but it would be nice to have a wider range.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, as pleased as I was with the guard adjustment, the Whisker Belly was a joke.  </li>
      <li>Definitely a must for the guy that likes to maintain the perfect scruff look!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>For that I&#x27;ll continue to shop on Amazon but will make sure of what I&#x27;m getting before I buy.</li>
      <li>All in all, I&#x27;ve been really pleased with the product and recommend it.</li>
      <li>This would be a much better product if it adjusted to a longer length.</li>
      <li>9.00 wahl trimmer from the drug store does a better job.</li>
      <li>At that price point, there should be much better design and battery life.</li>
      <li>Do not buy this product, they make their advertisements of the product great but the real deal is trash.</li>
      <li>in all it gets the job done, but so do most trimmers.  </li>
      <li>; is a joke you get more hair on your hand and sink.</li>
      <li>Most of us like to travel</li>
      <li>so it won&#x27;t turn on when traveling and works a lot better.</li>
      <li>I think this is another attempt to slap more symbols on the box and add more buttons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sure the results vary from person to person.  </li>
      <li>it was a lower price we might give it more stars.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more comparable to entry level trimmers than high-grade ones found in barber shops.</li>
      <li>This trimmer, of course, has no control circuitry, so they make YOU act as the controller, hitting a button to give the trimmer more power when it needs it.</li>
      <li>I wanted to love this product</li>
      <li>If this methodology works through April 2014 giving me a year of service, I will be completely satisfied.</li>
      <li>Good product.&lt;br /&gt;Finition (cheap plastic) may have been better, but worth the price anyway.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m giving this trimmer 2 stars since the motor seems pretty good.</li>
      <li>It has easy attachments for better length control.</li>
      <li>This is my second product from the Mangroomer products and it does a great job and is very easy to use.</li>
      <li>So far, the customer service and backing up of their product is great.  </li>
      <li>but I find that it still leaves a good bit lying around no matter how much you happen to be trimming.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall it&#x27;s easy to use and well-made.  </li>
      <li>For men like my husband who sometimes want to \\&quot;rock the stubble\\&quot; as opposed to cleanly shaving or just letting their beard grow out, this device couldn&#x27;t work better.</li>
      <li>I went on Amazon and ordered this item and received it very quickly.</li>
      <li>It is a quality product and the slim profile was easy to hold in my hand and position.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m becoming increasing efficient and comfortable with it with each use.</li>
      <li>/&gt;While the adjustment specificity is a nice concept, I&#x27;ve found the comb/guard doesn&#x27;t permit me to trim my beard at a consistent height.</li>
      <li>It does a good job around the Adam&#x27;s-apple, better than most actually.</li>
      <li>overall build feels strong and sturdy and it trims a perfect stubble length pretty easy.  </li>
      <li>and you&#x27;re sure to find better performing, more reasonably priced grooming options available.</li>
      <li>It shaves just fine, but it would lose the charge in 2-3 uses.</li>
      <li>It is going to leave stubble, and that is fine.</li>
      <li>Easy to maneuver, easy to clean, easy to adjust.  </li>
      <li>Good looking device, that beats the competition in more than one area, certainly an asset for the modern man lifestyle.</li>
      <li>When it worked, it was great but for what I paid for it, I expected more than a five month lifespan.  </li>
      <li>The idea that you can dial in a length and have it be accurate is bogus.</li>
      <li>The battery is a huge drawback on this item.  </li>
      <li>Most of them would do but this product lets you have fun with your scruff.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Another disappointed owner who&#x27;s Mangroomer Scruff Sculptor only lasted a few months with once a week use before it developed the shutting off after a few seconds issue that many owners seem to suffer. I think they really do warrant a recall. I wouyld really not recommend thsi product! :(</li>
    <li> Good:&lt;br /&gt;The ability to make small adjustments at low heights is a great idea (see bads).&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer motor is strong enough to get through my beard in a couple of passes.&lt;br /&gt;The terribly-named whisker belly catches most of the hair, just remember not to turn it upside down (see bads)..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad:&lt;br /&gt;Hair falls out of the, ugh, &amp;#34;whisker belly&amp;#34; if you turn it upside down.&lt;br /&gt;While the adjustment specificity is a nice concept, I&#x27;ve found the comb/guard doesn&#x27;t permit me to trim my beard at a consistent height. The guard is flimsy and only extends behind the blades. So if you change your angle at all, you end up with a very close trim, even at a 5 mm setting. This is really what gives it 2 stars -- all this digital adjustment capability is meaningless since they&#x27;ve scrimped on the quality of the comb/guard.&lt;br /&gt;For shame, it was so close!</li>
    <li> Good product.&lt;br /&gt;Finition (cheap plastic) may have been better, but worth the price anyway.</li>
    <li> Battery will not hold a charge. Starting from fully charged I can only get one use of it. Have to turn on shaver before adjusting length controls. Expected better product for the money.</li>
    <li> This is the FIRST review I have ever written, mostly because I simply do not have the time to write them.  However, this product is so bad, that I had to warn others. Here are the highlights:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it 15 or so times before it essentially stopped working.  I turn the power on, it stays on for about 2 seconds before shutting back off.  Sure, I could shave with it if I don&#x27;t mind turing the power button back on every 2 seconds, but again, no time to deal with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Whisker belly does not work.  I&#x27;d say it catches about 10% of the whiskers.  They should call it the \\&quot;whisker repelley\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The guard (which actually did a decent job of adjusting, before the thing broke) looks good, at first. But, the thing is designed in such a way, that if you are looking for a length that is longer than the shortest few settings, your beard can actually go under the guard and get cut.  In other words, if you are looking for a 4.0mm length, you are highly likely to get a LOT of spots with a 0.3mm length.  If you are into the whole polka-dot look, this thing is for you.  If not, read on. The only way to avoid this problem is to hold the shaver at an exact angle to your face the whole time you are shaving.  I don&#x27;t have the time to use a protractor while I shave.  Take a look at some pictures to see the problem &#x27;space&#x27; between the guard and the shaver where I lost 4 weeks of solid beard growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s more, (and I am not the first reviewer to post this), I am highly suspicious that the company that makes mangroomer is posting fake positive reviews, and marking authentic, negative reviews &#x27;unhelpful&#x27;. If you are really considering this product, take a look at the 5 star reviews (all very similar), and then the 1 star reviews. The only reason I bought this piece of trash in the first place was because of the 5 star reviews on amazon.  Don&#x27;t believe them!</li>
    <li> Not the greatest trimmer but not bad either.  It&#x27;s decent for trimming the sides and for touch up, but for heavier trimming it&#x27;s not very accurate.  The whisker belly feature is more of a gimmick than anything, the hair goes pretty much everywhere but the whisker belly, so it&#x27;s pretty much useless; good idea, just poorly executed.  If it had a built-in vacuum like other, similar products have, then it&#x27;d be more functional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The power burst definitely gives an additional, helpful boost of power for trimming through a little thicker hair, but it&#x27;s just marketing for various power levels, so nothing special in this regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The electric length controls is another concept that sounds good on paper but when faced with reality it falls short due to the dynamics of different types of hair, thickness, curliness, angle of trimming and the hairs themselves.  In other words it won&#x27;t be any more exact than your average hair trimmer, but it certainly does the job nonetheless, just don&#x27;t expect top-level precision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a fair trimmer but the high price is not justified, at a third the price it&#x27;d be reasonable.  It&#x27;s more comparable to entry level trimmers than high-grade ones found in barber shops.</li>
    <li> Great product that gives real good results.  With the popularity of wearing a couple of days growth by many men this shaver helps you to maintain a certain amount of stubble.  It is a great product for what it is intended to do.</li>
    <li> Great Product!  This is my second product from the Mangroomer products and it does a great job and is very easy to use.</li>
    <li> Total garbage!  worked great for 1 month then stopped working just after you could no longer return for refund/replacement.  I went back to Norelco $15 shaver and 2 years later still works great!</li>
    <li> This was one of the most disappointing products I have ever purchased.  With the battery fully and correctly charged, the mangroomer lasted for 4 regular shaves, about a week, before it needed to be recharged.  Then it lasted for a few shaves and needed to be recharged and then it died after one shave.  When it was fully charged again, the shaver would not adjust the length of the shaver head at all for any reason.  I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Only worked for s few months then won&#x27;t hold a charge. This was my second one both broke same way same time.</li>
    <li> Overall it does a pretty good job. Upper lip area and jaw line area it does not do so well. And the &amp;#34;whisker belly&amp;#34; is a joke you get more hair on your hand and sink.</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband as he likes to keep a goatee and the rest as stubble. So having a capable trimmer is nice. Unfortunately, this did not turn out as expected...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades are sharp and there is plenty of motor power. So it does trim well. Also, the guard and the blade detach, so cleaning is simple. Unfortunately, that&#x27;s where the good ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Whisker Belly, as they call it, is a joke. My husband let his facial hair grow out a bit and went to trim it down to a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow stubble. When he was done trimming, there were only a few hairs inside the Belly. The rest were either collected around the blade or around the sink. It would be a great feature - if it worked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The precision length settings are another waste unless you keep one portion of your facial hair long and the rest at stubble. And even then, you have to hold the trimmer just right, or you&#x27;ll end up trimming too short. The guard is only on the top of the blade, so holding the trimmer at an angle allows the blade to trim short. The precision they note means that you have to be very precise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And why is there a Burst option? Why not just have it always on Burst? Does someone want to trim at slow speed? I think this is another attempt to slap more symbols on the box and add more buttons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, it would be nice to have a stand for the trimmer. You get a plug and the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a gadget that has buttons to make the guard magically move and a shiny LCD and only want to trim down to stubble, then this may work for you. Otherwise, find another trimmer - one with a length guard that does its job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this trimmer 2 stars since the motor seems pretty good. In fact, if you do end up buying it, take the guard off and just use it as a standard trimmer.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the reservoir for holding shaved hair, which worked fairly well. But then I discovered it wouldn&#x27;t hold much of a charge. I contacted the company and they very kindly sent me a new one, but I had the same issue. It shaves just fine, but it would lose the charge in 2-3 uses. If you don&#x27;t mind keeping it plugged in all the time, then go for it. But if battery life is important to you, go with the Philips Norelco vacuum shaver.</li>
    <li> Did notice that the receptacle for storing the whiskers does not seal completely so a little mess is expected. For the jobs it is intended to do it did very well. This company has its own look and makes their products, as opposed to other products of the same kind, look a little more modern. Tried it in all the functions it can deliver and the results were nice and efficient. As a Scruff Sculptor it did very well for I made sure I let go of shaving for a few days just to see how it performed. The stubble was trimmed slowly but surely until it looked, actually, quite elegant and manageable. The power burst also helps a lot and overall I must say this product delivers on its promise. Charging time was no problem and cleaning the unit after using it was a breeze. Found it really helpful and even though it was not outstanding in every way, it easily earns an above average rating. The MANGROOMER Scruff Sculptor PRO Stubble Trimmer with Electric Length Controls, Whisker Belly and Power Burst is a neat tool to have and use for the modern man. Good looking device, that beats the competition in more than one area, certainly an asset for the modern man lifestyle. 4 Stars!</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift for my hubby. He so far is very happy with it&#x27;s trimming capabilities. Hopefully this trimmer will last for a while becasue he tends to kill these little hand held devices relatively fast. Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> The Mangroomer is a classic example of a marketing department writing checks the product can&#x27;t cash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;Whisker Belly\\&quot; and digital length adjustment had me looking forward to firing up this razor, but one feature shined while the other failed miserably.  Upon pressing the length button for the first time I marvelled at how the blade guard glided silently to just the right setting.  The guard stayed firmly in place as well.  This was a welcome change to the flimsy guards I have grown accustomed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, as pleased as I was with the guard adjustment, the Whisker Belly was a joke.  There is no suction or other method of drawing beard clippings into the belly, so whiskers zinged and bounced all over the bathroom just as they would with any other razor.  I laughed when I opened the belly after a full-beard trim to find the chamber almost completely clean- there were only perhaps eight to ten hairs inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fatal flaw of the Mangroomer, though, is the blade guard design.  Although the length adjustment was fantastic, the tines of the guard do not extend past the blade.  This means that the exposed portion of the blade dips down and cuts hairs in front of the guard at the shortest length.  This made it nearly impossible to get an even shave at any length over the minimum, thus negating any benefit of the precise guard adjustment.  The good news is that this is one of the closest shaving trimmers I&#x27;ve ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With features that don&#x27;t work, sub-par results, and a high price tag, it just doesn&#x27;t make sense to drop ~$80 on this  contraption.  Keep shopping around and you&#x27;re sure to find better performing, more reasonably priced grooming options available.</li>
    <li> This is a great quality trimmer, it trims my goatee with ease and precision,&lt;br /&gt;It is even better than my trusty Conair trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;I have never tried on a full beard since I have never grown one, I use it to trim my goatee twice a week (usually Sun and Wed), and it does the job well, along with my daily blade shave.&lt;br /&gt;It also seems to hold a charge well, so no problems in that departmant.&lt;br /&gt;One feature I really dig is called the \\&quot;Whisker Belley\\&quot; which holds the hair from the shave, just empty after each shave, pretty cool IMO.&lt;br /&gt;It also has \\&quot;Power Burst\\&quot; button, that give is more shaving power for thicker/coarser hair, Tim Allen from Home Improvement would have loved that \\&quot;more power\\&quot; addition to this device!&lt;br /&gt;I can truly recommend this stellar grooing tool for men, afterall its called the MANGROOMER trimmer!</li>
    <li> Had I not previously owned two Norelco beard trimmers, I would have been more impressed with the Mangroomer. Unlike the Mangrooer, the Norelco trimmers have a vacuum feature that minimizes the amount of whiskers that cover the sink, counter top, etc. The \\&quot;whisker belly\\&quot; in the Mangroomer catches some of the whiskers, but doesn&#x27;t do nearly as good a job as the Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, the Mangroomer does an excellent job of cutting and allows for more control over the length of your beard/stubble than any other trimmer I&#x27;ve used, including the Norelco trimmers.</li>
    <li> It works great for the &amp;#34;stubble&amp;#34; look - much better than another man groomer product I have.  It also works great for my chest hair.  I put it on the longest setting and it trims my chest hair to the perfect length that I like - no more old man hair sticking out of my collar!</li>
    <li> For men like my husband who sometimes want to \\&quot;rock the stubble\\&quot; as opposed to cleanly shaving or just letting their beard grow out, this device couldn&#x27;t work better. It seems to be made precisely for men who don&#x27;t want the closest shave they can get but still want to keep the hair to a certain length. The product is thoughtfully designed and well-constructed, and the price is good enough that it makes a great gift for father&#x27;s day or other gift giving situations. it never hurts to have an item like this on hand, especially for summer vacation. We really like it!</li>
    <li> Works good for me as a trimmer for beard and mustache , but when you try cut longer hair got litlle problems</li>
    <li> I purchased the scruff sculptor a little less than a year ago.  I agree with many of the reviews that say it is a decent stubble razor.  There is no vacuum but if you shave over t he sink area it&#x27;s not really a big deal. Yes there are no accessories like a bag but at least by the time I purchased my unit ManGroomer had elected to include a tiny cleaning brush.  My two biggest complaints are 1) the tabs on  the whisker belly are very fragile and 2) I found out as I tried to order a replacement whisker belly cover (the red plastic thing) that Mangroomer customer service sucks.  It is not that they are bad.  They are just unreacheable. There is an 800 number but that is ONLY to sell products.  I have tried e-mailing, filling out the form on their website, talking to sales staff asking to relay a message to customer service bit have never received a word back.  All I wanted to do was order a replacement red plastic piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for that reason I gave  the company two stars.  This is a fairly expensive product for what it is and I would have expected the ability to be able to contact someone/anyone at mangroomer to talk about the product.</li>
    <li> Horrible!!!! Fell apart within weeks and on top of it didn&#x27;t do a good job. Will never purchase again period!!</li>
    <li> Groomer isn&#x27;t able to trim the stubble as short as I had hoped it would. The shortest setting leaves the stubble a little longer than it should. It works ok, not great, just ok.</li>
    <li> The MANGROOMER Scruff Sculptor PRO Stubble Trimmer (not sure who came up with the long name) makes many promises, but fails to live up to most of them.  This is similar to something you would buy on late night TV.  It promises the perfect stubble look, precision, and a whisker belly to reduce cleanup but doesn&#x27;t really deliver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure the results vary from person to person.  I have a fairly thick beard and usually do not like shaving all the way to the skin because of irritation.  I had high hopes for the Sculptor Pro and tried various settings, but it just never felt close enough to the skin.  The whisker belly, as they call it, does catch some of the hair but I find that it still leaves a good bit lying around no matter how much you happen to be trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device feels cheap in the hand.  The plastic, the controls, none of it really feels solid.  The burst option is simply a gimmick.  Overall, there are other cheaper alternatives that perform above and beyond.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t go near this. A horrible product which Amazon should be ashamed to be associated with. The reality is this only has one shaving length. But don&#x27;t worry about that - my shaver won&#x27;t stay on for more than 3 seconds so the length settings don&#x27;t really matter. Worst of all Amazon won&#x27;t allow me to return this???  WASTE of $$$$</li>
    <li> DOES NOT HOLD THE CHARGE.  I SHOULD HAVE RETURNED IT AFTER USING IT.  MY MISTAKE. I HAVE SINCE GONE BACK TO A PREVIOUS PURCHASED TRIMMER.</li>
    <li> After receiving this razor I charged it for over 24hrs.  I showed to have a full charge.  I used the razor one time and the battery indicator started flashing low battery.  AFTER using one time.  I&#x27;m going to throw this razor in the trash and start all over.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because Mangroomer implied that it cut much closer than the average beard trimmer.  However, with the adjustible guard completely removed, it cut the hair to maybe 2 millimeters, but nowhere near the .03 millimeters they claim.  The Whisker Belly might capture half the hairs.  Highly dissapointed.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed with this product. I have always heard advertisements on Howard Stern radio show about the MANGROOMER brand and their products so I wanted to give them a try. I went on Amazon and ordered this item and received it very quickly. When I opened the product I noticed that one of the teeth that protects the face from the blades was bent in and when I attempted to straighten it, it fell off. The plastic on the device is very cheap and I would not recommend this product for that reason. I also do not like that for the money it does not come with a nice charging stand - I was very disappointed about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would think that in this day an age a company that is trying to brake into the very competitive man grooming business, would come to market with a superior product with all the bell and whistle and made of tough material - After all, it is for a man!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry all but I cannot recommend MANGROOMER at this time. I hope they get it together because I had high hopes for this brand.</li>
    <li> One of the worst purchases this century.  Battery lasts half a trim, takes hours to charge, has a special feature where it runs for 3 seconds and shuts off, creates uneven beard, and this whisker belly is that of an ethiopian child begging for one little chin hair to fall in.  DEFINITELY GET THIS ISH!</li>
    <li> this thing crapped out on me a little after a year. never really liked it in the first place. the whisker belly didnt capture much of the clippings, it never really got that close even with the guard off.</li>
    <li> Not worth it!  Company should spend more time with product development and less time on the marketing B.S.  Save your money!</li>
    <li> Purchased two of these. First one arrived broken (would not power on). Second one (replacement) worked for about three days then the blades stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Piece of junk - spend the money and buy a Andis GTX T-Outliner</li>
    <li> Easy to maneuver, easy to clean, easy to adjust.  Does a good job shaving.  I like how I can charge it and it stays charged for a nice, long time.</li>
    <li> My husband loves the Mangroomer.</li>
    <li> The Mangroomer&#x27;s build quality is pretty solid.  The arrow buttons looked cheap but worked well, the digital interface was easy to read and the controls were intuitive and performed well.  The blade-guard that controls the length of the cut is tricky to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mangroomer takes a little getting used to, since you have to keep it at a 90-degree angle to your face or it doesn&#x27;t work properly.  It will either cut the hair too short or not at all.  For moustaches, that&#x27;s a bit more effort than it may be worth.  If I had a full beard, this might be more useful.  Also, I found that hair didn&#x27;t travel into the \\&quot;belly\\&quot; as intended, which made that feature gimmicky.  I had to use a brush from another clipper to clean the mangroomer, since it had none.  For $100, it seems overpriced and has an \\&quot;as seen on tv\\&quot; feel to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s easy to use and well-made.  I&#x27;m not sure if its functionality merits its price tag.</li>
    <li> I got the Mangroomer to replace my $20 cheapo remington beard trimmer.  It&#x27;s a well built product, but my old cheap trimmer cuts better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t shave down to my skin with a razor (Mach 3 or electric) or else I get extreme irritation, so I use beard trimmers to get as close as possible but so the hair remains above the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the MG on the lowest 3mm setting, my stubble didn&#x27;t look good enough for work, so I pulled the guide off and used the Mangroomer&#x27;s blade directly on my skin.  I wasn&#x27;t impressed.  For comparison I even shaved half my face with the MG and the other half with my cheapo trimmer.  The cheapo does a much better, more thorough job of uniformly cutting stubble in fewer passes, which stinks b/c I really wanted to like the MG and now I&#x27;m out $80.  Even when I grew a beard and wanted to trim it with the guide on, this product didn&#x27;t consistently trim my beard well.  And, no, the whisker belly doesn&#x27;t do much - you&#x27;re going to still get hair all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no animosity toward this product - I tried it and it failed.  It doesn&#x27;t work as well as a 5 year old $20 cheap beard trimmer, so it&#x27;s clearly not worth $80.</li>
    <li> The selling point of this thing is that you can digitally set the length, but I couldn&#x27;t really get it to work, no matter what number I set the trimmer at, I was seeing the same result. The trimmer is also really cheap-feeling, the plastic just gives me no confidence in it at all. It wouldn&#x27;t be such a problem if it were sold for 10-$15 like other cheap trimmers, but at $60, it&#x27;s just a rip-off. Avoid!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve now used this for several months. It shaves okay, meaning it is no better or worse than any of the other trimmers I&#x27;ve owned (which are numerous). The whisker belly is just a gimmick, it doesn&#x27;t really trap much at all. The power burst is a power burst, but it needs the power boost on for shaving all the time making it another gimmick. These are not complaints, just thoughts on the items selling points. In hand it feels a bit unwieldy compared to the many much smaller models, but I got used to that pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all it gets the job done, but so do most trimmers.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this over the competition, but I also wouldn&#x27;t recommend the competition over this trimmer either.</li>
    <li> This is another updated review.  When I originally tried the Mangroomer, it stopped working.  Mangroomer responded to the two star review by offering me a replacement.  Obviously, sometimes a faulty product goes out on the market, and Mangroomer responded very fast.  So far, the customer service and backing up of their product is great.  I gave it five stars.  The Mangroomer is a really great grooming product.  Except:  The battery life is terrible. Either that or they have serious problems with their manufacturer.  The customer service before was great. However, no, I will not contact them again. They have a bad batter life or some issue with charging and this is after getting TWO of them and BOTH of them failing long before they should be.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for athletes that need to trim their body hair really short.  The only problem is in the  \\&quot;high power mode\\&quot;, the battery life is very short!  It is so short that I had to exchange it thinking that there was a problem with this product.  Besides that this groomer is great.  It has an LED light built in, and it is easy to adjust the setting for different lengths.  All of the Mangroomer products are high quality.  You will be happy just keep a plug close by.</li>
    <li> The charge lasts long enough for me to trim my beard, goatee, and head (yes I use it for my head too). I&#x27;ve found that the lowest/shortest setting is the only setting that works for keeping my head trimmed (I do it once a week) any higher setting and I get an very uneven &amp;#34;striped&amp;#34; trim.&lt;br /&gt;On my beard &amp; goatee, the &amp;#34;beard belly&amp;#34; is useless, the hairs go everywhere BUT into the &amp;#34;belly&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I set it to 1.1 for my goatee, and it takes several passes to get an even trim.&lt;br /&gt;To recharge, it takes at least 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;YMMV.</li>
    <li> i found the trimming lengths to be inaccurate because it didn&#x27;t matter what position i set it to. i found myself making lines on my beard all over my beard, even when i tried to follow their concept. I should feel free to just slide a machine on my facial hair without having to worry about keeping the machine at a certain position. this may me feel uncomfortable. the whisker belly didn&#x27;t trap any of my hair, instead i found hair around the sink, floor and on me. the item also smelled like it was made out of a lot of chemicals and that really made me feel strange. i couldn&#x27;t handle the odor of the product. i found it funny that my $25 stubble trimmer worked a lot better than this one. product returned for refund.</li>
    <li> When I bought this I thought this one looks pretty cool. I used it once and the digital display and controls stopped working then it would work and not work. I returned it to Amazon and bought a Norelco QT4070 and it works great. The Mangroomer trims very uneven because there is nothing on the front of the blade. You have to press it against your face and it trims uneven. The Norelco has the same features digital display and also has a travel button so it won&#x27;t turn on when traveling and works a lot better.</li>
    <li> Product design is average, but for the price that&#x27;s what I expected.  It does exactly what it says, and well.  I dont like going clean shaven and I don&#x27;t like have a 5-7 day beard.  This allows me to maintain that sweet scruff experienced on day 2 or 3 (depending how fast your facial hair grows) and allows me to maintain the same look daily.  Cleanup is average, irritation has been minimal. power burst is clutch too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get one.</li>
    <li> I use this for fine trimming of hair and it works very well. The only thing was I had the read the instructions several times extremely carefully and I felt they were not too clear at some parts. But once that was taken care off through careful reading and some experimentation, there were no further issues. It is a quality product and the slim profile was easy to hold in my hand and position. It does trim well as claimed and is comfortable on the skin.</li>
    <li> Somehow the trimmer is not holding up to being as comfortable, reliable or quality operating as other famous companies out there. I think they need another design round to iron up the shortcomings and make it ready for prime time.</li>
    <li> As a basic groomer, this is perfectly adequate. It cuts hair (not difficult) and has an adjustable guard. So, I recommend it without enthusiasm as a decent groomer that does the job. If you can find a cheaper one, however, and you probably can, you should probably buy it. The extra features of this groomer, the \\&quot;power burst\\&quot; and electric length control, are just cheap gimmicks that don&#x27;t justify the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the electric length control: Yes, it makes the guard go up and down. But that&#x27;s the extent of its usefulness. The idea that you can dial in a length and have it be accurate is bogus. The mechanism has so much slop in it that you can&#x27;t trust anything the display says. You pretty much need to just adjust this with the buttons until you get it where you like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as for the \\&quot;power boost\\&quot; feature: this is actually a great example of the limitations of the cheaply made product being sold as a \\&quot;feature\\&quot;. Why would you need power boost? Because you are trying to cut through some thicker hair, and the trimmer is getting bogged down and slowing down. You know what a good trimmer does, like the ones made by Braun? The micro controller inside notices that the trimmer is slowing down and gives more power to the motor to keep the oscillation speed the same no matter what the load. This trimmer, of course, has no control circuitry, so they make YOU act as the controller, hitting a button to give the trimmer more power when it needs it. Then, in a brilliant move from the marketing department, they sell this lack of sophistication as a feature by calling it the \\&quot;power boost\\&quot; feature. Nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, this is a decent and capable groomer, but the price is too high for what it does.</li>
    <li> This product works well.. but you have to recharge the damn thing nearly every day before the battery charge indicator starts blinking.</li>
    <li> Probably works better for someone that has thick facial hair. Different settings are nice, but it really doesn&#x27;t have &amp;#34;scruff&amp;#34; settings. I was looking for &amp;#34;Don Johnson from Miami Vice&amp;#34; settings.</li>
    <li> The lcd display for the settings is great and easy to use.  overall build feels strong and sturdy and it trims a perfect stubble length pretty easy.  going over the thicker areas a few times with the power blast is a nice add.  in simple terms, this is a great stubble trimmemr and you will be very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> My husband is an avid Howard Stern listener and has been bugging me for months to get one of these for him.  He&#x27;s been using a Norelco for the past 18 months but the battery life is waining so it was time for an upgrade.  He likes having a decent scruff and rarely shaves down to the skin, unless for the obligatory wedding or funeral.  So far the Scruff Sculptor has ticked all the boxes; it looks good, is portable, light-weight, not too noisy and leaves just enough hair to look as though my husband has just rolled out of bed.&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs up from us!</li>
    <li> I like the fine adjustments in length that it allows, which is why I purchased it, but it would be nice to have a wider range.  Overall it seems to work good.  Not sure about battery... I&#x27;ve only owned it a short while and already the battery seems to have lost some power.</li>
    <li> I had fairly high expectations for this after reading their website, the lowest setting it goes is 0.3mm. This is not very short, I was expecting the &amp;#34;5 o&#x27;clock shadow&amp;#34; look, or even the length of 1 day of no shaving. Well not for me, it was about equal to 2-3 days of no shaving. Also the head got stuck on a setting and I couldn&#x27;t get it to go up or down for about a week, and then randomly it started working again. The vacuum doesn&#x27;t catch all the stubble, so count on cleaning up after! Also I have to use the &amp;#34;power button&amp;#34; the whole time I shave or else it takes forever. The battery does not last very long at all, maybe 2 or 3 shaves tops.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed when I used this the first time.It was very weak even in stubble.The worst part is if you dont keep it on the guide which is only on the bottom you can cause a quick bald spot.it&#x27;s slow to use and just cheap.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product, they make their advertisements of the product great but the real deal is trash. The battery dies so quick, you can&#x27;t even use the power burst properly also the whisker belly won&#x27;t collect most of your hair!!</li>
    <li> I have a fairly thick beard and grew it out a bit so I could play around with the Mangroomer.  It does an admirable job.  I particularly like the adjustable heights.  It can be adjusted using up and down buttons for how low you want to trim.  A very nice feature if you are used to having to switch out guards on a trimmer.  It saves on storage area as well when you don&#x27;t need to keep all the guards handy. It has a catch area to catch the hair as you trim...  it didn&#x27;t really catch all that much with me.  That really didn&#x27;t bother me too much though, I pretty much expect a certain degree of \\&quot;clean up\\&quot; after a trim.  I keep my hair pretty short as well and on a whim I ran it up into my hair... that didn&#x27;t work so well.  It did a great job on the beard, but it really didn&#x27;t have the horsepower to handle actual hair.  I didn&#x27;t hold that against it either... that&#x27;s not what it was designed for.  Overall, it did the job it claimed to do admirably well and even with a couple of negatives... none were so bad that I felt I needed to drop a star.  If you buy, I hope you are as happy with it as I was and thank you for taking the time to read my review.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a device to trim my sideburns and this definitely isn&#x27;t it.  This beard groomer is designed to give you that three day beard look.  I&#x27;m more of a clean shave man myself, so this product doesn&#x27;t really work for me.  Still, this is no reason to grade it down, because I misunderstood what it does.  It is a very well designed unit and is made out of quality materials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I let my beard grow a few extra days and used the product a few times.  It took a little over 12 hours to fully charge the Mangroomer the first time.  Subsequent charges are supposed to take less time.  It does a good job of cutting your beard back for that scrubby look that is popular on some TV shows.  The Mangroomer has a trap to catch your cut whiskers and it does a good job of catching most of them.  You can change the length setting from 0.3mm to 5.0mm with the push of a button.  It doesn&#x27;t remember the setting the next time you use it unfortunately.  It also has a power burst feature for getting through really thick whiskers.  It does not have a case, but seems to be built like a tank, so I don&#x27;t think this is a big issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In spite of the fact that this doesn&#x27;t do what I wanted, it is a good whisker trimmer that will trim your beard back so you maintain that three day look.  If you want something that will give you that look, this is a good choice.  If you&#x27;re looking to trim your sideburns, look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I received the mangroomer through the vine program.  It seems to be well constructed and it will trim your stubble without pulling.  That&#x27;s about all I like about this product.  It is difficult, if not impossible, to achieve uniform lengths of stubble in the mustache and chin areas.  Working against the grain on your upper lip is asking for trouble.  Flip it over and go against with the grain and it cuts too short.  I won&#x27;t be using this much; I&#x27;ll stick to my $20 Phillips for this type of work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;oh, and 80 bucks?  Are you kidding me?  I&#x27;m betting that this will be down to $29.95 within a few short months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 stars; and that&#x27;s being generous.</li>
    <li> The Scruff sculptor does exactly what it was designed to do: quickly and easily make you look like you just rolled out of bed without the annoying neck beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves your face with just the little bit of scruff your hipster self needs to snag all those hipster chicks (tattoo parlor and thrift shop not included).</li>
    <li> As far as beard trimmers go, the Mangroomer is right up towards the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my time with it I&#x27;ve only had little miniscule complaints. The charge time (since it is wireless) seems a bit excessive and as far as the whisker belly goes, it&#x27;s nice but if you trim with damp hair it likes to get clogged and/or annoying to clean. But those complaints are bound to come up eventually out of sheer laziness or impatience. However, the battery life is right on par with what you&#x27;d expect from a wireless trimmer and it doesn&#x27;t pull or tug, not to mention it isn&#x27;t obnoxiously loud either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, you could do much worse and for the price you get a pretty good bang for your buck. You don&#x27;t see many models that feature a whisker belly to keep clean up as easy as possible, and while the charge time seems like a bit much the battery life is admirable. So for a budget beard trimmer I can&#x27;t recommend it enough.</li>
    <li> Scroll to bottom for update&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My beard grow by the hour. I don&#x27;t like the clean shaved look and I don&#x27;t like to have too much hair on my face because it bothersome. I have used so many different shavers in the past. Most of them would do but this product lets you have fun with your scruff. You can set it down to cut as short as .05 MM, that&#x27;s like a 000 blade for you clipperes. It allows you to precisely adjust the length as long as you like (one day scruff look, two day, three day, ect..).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you take the time, you can evenly scruff your beard so it looks very natural. It does the mustache area very nicely and gets a clean trimming around the nose area. The top of the shaver is not large so it makes the trimming part easy for going around the details.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just keep it on the charger all the time and it&#x27;s ready to go. Definitely a must for the guy that likes to maintain the perfect scruff look!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update April 2, 2013&lt;br /&gt;I have stopped using the unit and started using Phillips Norelco. The battery is dying out. It will work for 10 minutes and dies. Did get to enjoy it for long (maybe a good month).</li>
    <li> This would be a much better product if it adjusted to a longer length. My husband was using it when he was growing out his goatee, but then when the hair got longer, he realized that he couldn&#x27;t trim his beard with it. I know it&#x27;s not meant for that, but it would be nice to have more versatility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what it is, though, it&#x27;s well-made and has great features. He likes it.</li>
    <li> Doesnt work as advertised. Unless you have a really long beard and want to take a lot off at a time the guard is worthless. Definitely NOT a stubble trimmer by any means and shouldnt even be used for short beards. Whats more is mine broke after just a few months. I turn it on and it turns right back off after 2 seconds.</li>
    <li> It did nothing it wash suppose t do.  No battery heavy to hold and use.  So so disappointed. Would not reccomend.</li>
    <li> My scruff sculptor had a six month life span. I attempted to contact Man Groomer&#x27;s support both by phone and email and never received a response either way. It&#x27;s made in china crap with customer service as good as outsourced. Look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Does a good job cutting hair. Has great cutting power, very good and easy to operate features. But the negative to the groomer is that you cant keep a consistent length thought. Too hard to control. I think a smaller clipper or guard would do wonders. I have gone back to using my Gillette Pro Glide groomer. It has easy attachments for better length control. Just a few adjustments needed and this would be a great product.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this product has many flaws. It does not hold a charge well at all. The adjustable cutting only works marginally, it&#x27;s very easy to trim way too much off. Further, the whisker belly didn&#x27;t work at all for me. I wanted to love this product but there wasn&#x27;t one feature that worked as intended.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product five months ago as my first cordless beard trimmer.  I used it 2-3 times per week.  Now, it will not hold a charge as it will only run for a few seconds before shutting itself off.  When it worked, it was great but for what I paid for it, I expected more than a five month lifespan.  I would not purchase it again.  BUYER BEWARE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 04/2013 -- So, after reading the note above, the company was gracious enough to send me another one free, despite the fact that the product information states that there is only a 1-month warranty. I will update this review when I see if the new one possesses a better lifespan than the original.  That said, you do have to admire a company that stands behind its product even after the published warranty period has elapsed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 09/2013  --  The new groomer is working as advertised.  The thing I did differently with this one was to NOT LEAVE IT PLUGGED IN ALL THE TIME !!  I use this one until the current charge is nearly gone and then charge it overnight.  I remove the charger and repeat.  So far, so good.  Updating my rating from 1 star to 3 stars.  If this methodology works through April 2014 giving me a year of service, I will be completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> at this time of my life, i don&#x27;t like (and don&#x27;t need) to have a closely shaven face every day. this replaced a broken Remington version with a vacuum, which caught hair better than this (no vacuum). i like the flexible head that follows my facial contour for easier navigation. the electronic display and control are modern and techy. this cleans up more easily than my old Remington. rated 4/5 stars cuz it leaves my facial hair on the sink after each use; a vacuum feature would be nice.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an older VACUUM trimmer only to find out this doesn&#x27;t have a VACUUM.  It relies on gravity to pull the hair into the \\&quot;wisker belly\\&quot; and it doesn&#x27;t work.  Hair gets all over the place which defeats the purpose.  I guess I should have done a little more research to make sure it had a vacuum.  The blades cut hair fairly well until I got to my neck where it pulled my hair and cut me.  I have to give credit to Amazon though: they refunded my money even though I had used the trimmer.  For that I&#x27;ll continue to shop on Amazon but will make sure of what I&#x27;m getting before I buy.</li>
    <li> Does not cut short enough. Even at the lowest setting and going against the grain does not give that stubble look.</li>
    <li> I read all of the positive reviews, which I am certain came from Mangroomer staff.  Due to a design flaw with the guide comb, it is impossible to trim to any length other than the shortest setting, since the blade is in constant contact with your face.  When the red guide moves up as you increase the length (starting at .3mm) it doesn&#x27;t ever actually go above the actual blade - so if you keep the red guard in contact with your face at all times (which is impossible when going under the neck and around curves) you won&#x27;t actually trim anything.  If you &amp;#34;scrape&amp;#34; which is how normal products like this work, there is no difference between using the lowest 0.3 setting and any higher one since the actual blade is in contact with your face.  Even if you have a longer beard and trim to a length where the guard is higher than the blade, one tiny false move and you will have a bald spot.  This product is a total waste of money, and I honestly believe that the reviews are fake.  The design is incredibly short sighted.  I am returning it and providing feedback directly to the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> This shaver has a very good battery life compared to others I&#x27;ve used. While others fade quickly and cannot hold a charge to get me through a week of usage, I had no such problems with this one. The feel in the hand is not as good as some other shavers with their contoured grips and ergonomic shapes, but the size is still good enough for my big hands (I wear extra large gloves). The stubble trimmer is not the best I&#x27;ve used, but it does a fair job of cutting close. It does a good job around the Adam&#x27;s-apple, better than most actually. The controls are perhaps a bit less intuitive than some other shavers, but it&#x27;s nothing insurmountable. All in all, I consider this an above-average shaver, and I&#x27;ve gone through more than a dozen in the past decade.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this so bad. The idea is sound but it is just not quite right. I have had for about a month and it just does not work well. It says it has a full charge but it only runs for about 5 seconds and then turns off. When it turns off it then rips out the scruff it was supposed to trim. I may have just got a bad one but I am not really happy with it.</li>
    <li> I FINALLY found a shaver that gives me the &amp;#34; buzz look&amp;#34; that I&#x27;ve been seeking for several years ( and I have a drawer full of discarded shavers to prove it)! I&#x27;m becoming increasing efficient and comfortable with it with each use.</li>
    <li> The guard on this piece of crap doesn&#x27;t extend over the edge of the blade, hence it does not do its job. As you tilt the handle, the length varies, and so, at any setting, you pretty much end up with either the shortest stubble possible, or a jagged, uneven cut. This renders the unit totally useless, except for the closest possible trim. No other setting works. This may be the stupidest design I have ever seen on any product, and I am amazed that someone or some team conceived of it, let alone executed it and tries to sell it. I foolishly discarded the packaging, and so could not return it, so it&#x27;s going in the donation pile. Stay away!</li>
    <li> I only have this for a few months, used it maybe 6 times all I can get out of the battery is about 10 mins from a full charge. For the money that I paid for, it&#x27;s not worth it not even close. Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
    <li> The worst trimmer i had ever tried.  It keep cut my hair from the other side 0 mm side because its not covered .</li>
    <li> My husband said this is the best trimmer he has ever had. He has very sensitive skin but needs to keep a close shave and/or trim due to his professional job. He uses it almost every day and said he will never try a different product. Would def recommend this!</li>
    <li> I normally don’t take the time to write reviews on products but this time it was necessary. This has to be the worst trimmer I have ever used. The sad part is it actually works well, when it works. The owner’s manual states charge the trimmer for 18 to 22 uninterrupted hours, which I did. The first few times it worked well. Then your operating time being to shorten each time you use it. The trimmer takes almost 9 hours to charge after the battery is depleted. The trimmer will only operate for 12 minutes on a full charge. Then one day it will stop working in the middle of your shave! To add insult to injury the trimmer’s battery life indicator shows 50% battery life.  I ordered a replacement from Amazon thinking it was just a defective one but the replacement acted the exact same way. I will never buy another Mangroomer product after my nightmarish experience with not one but two of their products. Try the Conair i-Stubble. I’ve been using it for a couple of weeks now and I love it!!!</li>
    <li> Product stopped working in 2 weeks.  Was really hoping that this was a quality product based on the expensive price tag but I was very disappointed.  Do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> The shaver is large and awkward to use. Even with the supercharge button on this thing doesn&#x27;t have the power or sharp enough blades to make much of a dent in my facial hair. It seems to grab and pull the hair rather than cut it.  Due to the poor craftsmanship/design it also triples the amount of time it takes to shave as I have to make dozens of extra passes to  insure it trimmed evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 9.00 wahl trimmer from the drug store does a better job.</li>
    <li> Directions for use:&lt;br /&gt;1) Remove from packaging.&lt;br /&gt;2) Butcher any stubble or beard growth you have.&lt;br /&gt;3) Place directly in garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This went directly in the garbage after 2 uses.  Horrible product.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent trimmer. Adjusting the trim you want at the touch of a button works great and is an great option that sets this trimmer apart from the others. No need to worry about putting on/taking off the plastic trimmer adapters, which sometimes get lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my honest opinion, this trimmer would have a perfect 5 star score from me if it had:&lt;br /&gt;-Standard USB cable charging - Very important to me. Most of us like to travel and we don&#x27;t want to carry 10 different chargers for the plethora of devices we bring on the road.&lt;br /&gt;-Higher capacity battery&lt;br /&gt;-Removable battery - Not exactly important, however it&#x27;d be nice to have this option. Possibly even to swap out with a few AA batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I highly recommend the sculptor pro. It&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve ever purchased over the years and if this one breaks, I&#x27;ll be sure to buy another one from mangroomer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: July 10, 2013:&lt;br /&gt;My trimmer started malfunctioning lately. After a full charge, I turn it on and when pressing the boost button it shuts off exactly 3 seconds later. Trying to turn it on again, 3 seconds later it shuts off. I keep it clean, even oiled the blades so it can run smoothly however I am suspecting the battery inside is going dead as the motor sounds like its down winding. I&#x27;m planning to send it in for warranty service, hopefully they company will fix the issue. It&#x27;s only been about 3 months.</li>
    <li> I do like this trimmer, works well and the turbo button is a real help when you have some long growth.</li>
    <li> as expected, good value</li>
    <li> The battery is a huge drawback on this item.  I&#x27;ve had about 4 different trimmers (some of them I still use), but bought this item because it seems little more &amp;#34;techy&amp;#34; than the other ones I&#x27;ve had (or currently have).  Amazon exchanged the first one of these I bought for me - I thought it was defective because the battery would drain out after about 3 trims.  Turns out that it&#x27;s not so much as the one that I had was defective - all of them pretty much function this way.  The new one may have lasted 3.5 trims on a charge, but that quickly deteriorated.  It went to doing one trim per charge after about 6 months.  Within a year, it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge at all.  Waste of money - I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Quite simply put, this trimmer seems like something that should cost about $19.95 sold in a blister pack at Walgreen&#x27;s or CVS. The build quality and materials do not warrant a $75 price tag. It feels cheap and light in your hand. The plastic is paper thin, which very well might be forgiven if it actually trimmed as advertised. Seeing as the guard is made of thin plastic, it bends if you put even the slightest bit of pressure on it. A guard that bends so easily equals a terrible uneven trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice: Look for a different brand. I have purchased two items from this manufacturer and both were inferior as compared to others on the market.</li>
    <li> First, to be clear, this unit is NOT a shaver. It is also not a beard trimmer. What it is meant to do is to create a rough stubble look. It is going to leave stubble, and that is fine. You can set how long or short that stubble is going to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fairly impressive how much money they are charging for a stubble-creator - and how the unit is not up to that standard. It&#x27;s a fairly flimsy unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a full beard that you want to take down to stubble, then it works reasonably well. But let&#x27;s say you have a goatee or other facial hair, and you want the rest to be stubble. It can&#x27;t handle that. It&#x27;s not good with edges. So it&#x27;s an all or nothing proposition. Everything on your face has to be that one same length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair collection unit is just done with gravity. So it doesn&#x27;t work very well. If you&#x27;re working from a fuller beard, they won&#x27;t go in at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit doesn&#x27;t seem to hold a charge very well. If you&#x27;re using it daily and charging it daily it should be OK. But if you go several days between charges it seems to drain fairly quickly. And then you have to wait to charge it back up again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it was a lower price we might give it more stars. But at the price they&#x27;re listing this for, it&#x27;s hard to give this more than three stars. There are so many other units out there at this price that both handle this set of tasks plus handle edging and multiple trim settings and are more sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rating: 3/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were sent a review copy of this unit to test.</li>
    <li> I like that this shaver gives a nice, smooth shave but what I was not impressed with was the battery.  I like to charge it once I am finished using it so it is ready for next time and each time I have pulled this out to use it, it will show full battery but it will drain pretty fast. It doesn&#x27;t do this from a fresh charge. For some reason it is not maintaining the charge like it should.  The whisker belly is nice if the hair you are cutting is short...but if the beard gets very long it doesn&#x27;t seem to fall into the belly.  I do love the digital length control, you can get precisely what cut you are looking for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve taken to carefully trimming my facial hair, and was despairing of finding the right tool when this came along. Well, it&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;s at least functional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plus is that it trims facial hair rather nicely, and helps me maintain just the right length. It&#x27;s got neat little arrows to guide the blades back and forth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s got two big minuses...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It&#x27;s got a &amp;quot;Whisker Belly&amp;quot; that&#x27;s supposed to catch trimmed hairs. Well, it catches only about a quarter to a third of what&#x27;s trimmed. I still have to prop a trash can under my chin when using this. If you&#x27;re not holding this just right, you&#x27;ll sprinkle hair all over the place. Serious design flaw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) It&#x27;s cordless, and comes with a charging cord, but this thing can&#x27;t hold a charge to save its life. I trim about once a week, and find I can use it twice before having to recharge it. You can&#x27;t use it while the charger is plugged in, and it takes FOREVER to recharge...the last time nearly 48 hours to build up a full charge. I&#x27;m sure this is a serious pain in the neck for those who use this daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend it? Well...eh... When fully charged, it does a decent job. But another issue is the price. At that price point, there should be much better design and battery life. A decent trimmer, but definitely overpriced for what it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: The charge-holding abilities have grown worse, and loses half its charge after only a brief session. I am sadly giving this the pitch as this is simply too much fuss to deal with. I&#x27;m knocking off a star; while I don&#x27;t hate it, it did a decent job for a while until the charging issue made it too much of a problem to deal with.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been very happy with how this razor performs.  I especially like how you can precisely set the length of beard that it removes using the controls and digital display.  It has a compartment that is supposed to collect the cut hair, but I haven&#x27;t found that it does so.  I trim over a small trash can to keep from clogging my sink. :)</li>
    <li> Terrible battery life; had to recharge after only a few uses.  Just stopped working after a couple of months.  Save your money.  Piece of crap.</li>
    <li> Rec&#x27;d in mail, opened and did not work?? Returned for refund.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the Mangroomer Scruff Sculptor for about 1 month now and really like it. The adjustable length comb feature which displays the trimming length you desire makes the task simple. I see some of the other reviews have complained about the comb length setting not having memory to automatically stay at the desired setting when turned off. I wouldn&#x27;t be concerned about it, when I turn it on in the morning it takes just a few seconds to get the setting I&#x27;m after, no big deal in my opinion. I like the two to three day feel and look, so for me the 2.5 mm setting works good. So far the whisker belly feature collects most of the cut hair, not many in the sink when I&#x27;m done. Have not had any problem at all with the trimmer pulling on/snagging hairs. I haven&#x27;t had the need yet to use the power burst button so I can&#x27;t rate that feature. All in all, I&#x27;ve been really pleased with the product and recommend it.</li>
    <li> Piece of garbage, only lasted 3 months. Purchased December 11, 2012, now March 23rd, 2013 it will not hold a charge.</li>
    <li> A few things I hated about this trimmer:&lt;br /&gt;1-Too noisy, very loud motor. I use ear plugs while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;2-The light is so annoying if you are sleeping and very irritating for the eyes if you are shaving; it is always on while charging or shaving.&lt;br /&gt;3-Bad battery, it loses charge quickly, specially if you use the Power Burst button, and often takes forever to charge.&lt;br /&gt;4-I can&#x27;t use this trimmer while plugged to the wall, I call this stupid!&lt;br /&gt;5-Very expensive for what you really get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t care about any of the above, this might be the right trimmer for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main reason I gave it 2 stars and not one is that it really shaves pretty good. I used only the lowest setting (.3 mm,) not too close shave as I thought it would be though.</li>
</ol>
