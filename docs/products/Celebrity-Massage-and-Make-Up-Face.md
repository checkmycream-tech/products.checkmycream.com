      <li>Be sure to remove the protective plastic bag.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this, I use the plastic face molds just in case a color doesn&#x27;t come off.</li>

      <li>Taking an eyelash extension coarse and this is working out perfect not to mention The price is fantastic!</li>

      <li>I was extremely satisfied</li>
      <li>glad i made this purchase i would def recommend for eyelash extension practice . . .</li>
      <li>The head is super amazing, once you learn how to get rid of the stains.</li>
      <li>So easy to do, I just love it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried soap, Magic Eraser, Fantastic, and lots of elbow grease.  </li>
      <li>Easy to write the muscles and nerves on the face.</li>
      <li>Apply your mannequin conditioner; easy on..easy off..</li>
      <li>I ordered this make-up face to teach face painting techniques despite the reviews that the paint does not come off easily.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to fit into my carry bag.</li>
      <li>But for practicing, it works just fine.</li>
      <li>A great help for me when I was doing my facial exams, test, and check-out.</li>
      <li>This product is great for perfecting the flow of your facial massage for estheticians!</li>
      <li>Easy to clean, remove make-up with baby wipes or Lysol wipes.</li>
      <li>Works great flat or using with a stand.</li>
      <li>in all this is a good toy for a young girl to do makeup on to save all the dolls in the house, but my daughter says she would not recommend this for someone who is older and needs more of a practice face then a toy.</li>
      <li>mannequin is perfect for instruction and practice for various techniques regarding facial massage, makeup application, and lash extensions.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I suggest cleaning it up right after you use it and not let it sit overnight or for days with product.</li>
      <li>I even apply oil on it to do the nourishing massage and it cones right off.</li>
      <li>Great to paint with, but it does stain (mostly with red and black that I found).</li>
      <li>/&gt;makeup doesn&#x27;t clean off very well</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really fit my need but decent product</li>
      <li>Everything was perfect until I used black Wolfe paint 😡 also red, now my mask is all stained.</li>
      <li>But for practicing your strokes and new designs it still works fine.</li>
      <li>Shipping was super fast, I ordered it for eyelash extensions</li>
      <li>just be careful what kind of paint you use on it.</li>
      <li>Cosmetics wipe away cleanly, if not left on the faces for more than a couple of hours--so for long-term modeling of your work, I would not suggest this product.</li>
      <li>Hello ,  I am a current student of Esthetics school and I purchased this item so that I am able to practice my facials .</li>
      <li>so I could practice and be sure I had fluid motions.</li>
      <li>Just bear in mind, they WILL STAIN if pigmented products are left on them for more than a couple of hours at a time.</li>
      <li>I wipe the majority of the paint off with baby-wipes first, then use the acetone to remove the stains.</li>
      <li>When I first got this face</li>
      <li>/&gt;makeup doesn&#x27;t show up good until you cake it on with a few layers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy to say I passed the boards a few years ago and still use this product now to try out new things or refresh my technique without using a client.</li>
      <li>Nice but dark face paint colors stain it.</li>
      <li>They are decently sized and feel pretty close to real skin.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>I was expecting this to be something I could really practice on</li>
      <li>Once you put on the paint the stains aren&#x27;t really a problem they don&#x27;t show through.</li>
      <li>I am surprised that so many people have considered these heads &#x27;child face&#x27; size...I would say they&#x27;re slightly bigger than that.</li>
      <li>I was unsure about buying this, but it works great to adhere false strip lashes onto for practice.</li>
      <li>It came right off though when I squirted it with a bleach spray such as Chlorox Clean-up or similar product (be sure to rinse it off well.)</li>
      <li>It was exactly as described and arrived quickly in time for a birthday present.</li>
      <li>I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t roll around like other mannequin heads.</li>
      <li>I do not recommend using a lot of red though I think it would quickly become a problem as it really doesn&#x27;t come off well at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Definitely not easy to clean and the makeup doesn&#x27;t show up richly.</li>
      <li>Stains easily and is hard to clean, but works for what I need it for.</li>
      <li>The face feels almost realistic.</li>
      <li>After doing some price research including various cosmetology supply web stores and eBay, it is evident Amazon had the absolute lowest price with reasonable shipping.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product .</li>
      <li>So far it works really well</li>
      <li>The flat back fit snuggly over my &#x27;Manikin Holder&#x27;, and stayed in position without shifting during the exam.</li>
      <li>The clean-up is a breeze with no stains left behind if you first use regular wipes, then take Mr. Clean Magic Eraser and dip into alcohol and scrub the stains off.  </li>
      <li>good for light make up nothing heavy or dark... waste of money ...</li>
      <li>Although it is a cheaper paint, it acts like the more expensive paints when applying it to this make-up face and is an economical way to practice or teach new designs or techniques.  </li>
      <li>I have large hands/long fingers, and managed to manipulate the &#x27;skin&#x27; of the mannequin with relative ease.</li>
      <li>Large enough to be almost life size.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I ordered this make-up face to teach face painting techniques despite the reviews that the paint does not come off easily.  It is true that the black and red paint does stain, especially the red. I used a magic eraser with a little dish soap added to remove the black, but the red would not come off this way no matter how hard I scrubbed. It came right off though when I squirted it with a bleach spray such as Chlorox Clean-up or similar product (be sure to rinse it off well.) NOTE: THE PAINT THAT CAME OFF WAS SNAZAROO FACE PAINT. Although it is a cheaper paint, it acts like the more expensive paints when applying it to this make-up face and is an economical way to practice or teach new designs or techniques.  I tried a very small area of a better quality face paint (such as Wolfe, which I prefer for actual face painting) and it DID NOT come completely off even with the bleach spray. I hope this review can help other face painters deciding whether to buy this product. This make-up face is a great learning/teaching tool, but just be careful what kind of paint you use on it.</li>
    <li> After doing some price research including various cosmetology supply web stores and eBay, it is evident Amazon had the absolute lowest price with reasonable shipping. eBay vendors and the other stores wanted an average of $35 to $50 with an attached shipping fee.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has a vendor here that carries a soft form replacement face for this mannequin that can be purchased separately.&lt;br /&gt;This mannequin is perfect for instruction and practice for various techniques regarding facial massage, makeup application, and lash extensions.&lt;br /&gt;It should be noted that the mannequin has a mild vinyl-plastic smell that may be unpleasant to those with sensitive noses (which is why I gave this 4 stars, vs 5). In this event I would place this in a well ventilated room to air out for a couple of days. Be sure to remove the protective plastic bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please see comments/posts for updated information. Thanks.</li>
    <li> The paint leaves a mark that is very hard to get off especially red or black. I can get most  of it off but it&#x27;s exhausting to do all the scrubbing.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> The head is super amazing, once you learn how to get rid of the stains. I used rubbing alcohol to get rid of stains, which works well!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for a 12 year old girl who is both in love with YouTube make-up tutorials, but who also unfortunately has a bit of a problem with pubescent acne :( This was a perfect solution.  She&#x27;s using it quite a lot and her face is clearing up.  I was a litle afraid she&#x27;d be creeped out by it, but no, she loves it!</li>
    <li> This mannequin was awesome. Perfect for my skin care state board.</li>
    <li> Hello ,  I am a current student of Esthetics school and I purchased this item so that I am able to practice my facials . This face is great for anything from massage to makeup . I even apply oil on it to do the nourishing massage and it cones right off. I would highly recommend this product .</li>
    <li> This was perfect for me to practice eyelash extensions. I glue on fake strip lashes, practice applying and I can peel them off when I&#x27;m done. I can sit in front of the tv, or at any table and just practice. It&#x27;s easy to fit into my carry bag.</li>
    <li> I bought this to practice facial massage.  This is not a life size mannequin head.&lt;br /&gt; I am finding that the face is small -- like a not full grown teen face.&lt;br /&gt;the lower jaw/chin/mouth area is very small.  big forehead.&lt;br /&gt;so not great for my purposes.</li>
    <li> Dark colors of face paint stain the &amp;#34;skin&amp;#34;. Goo Gone and elbow grease can get most of it off, but there is always a shadow. But for practicing, it works just fine.</li>
    <li> a teacher recommended this.  great for practice</li>
    <li> I like this mannequin.. She (because I use it for applying makeup).. Sits still, doesn&#x27;t complain and cooperates.. Apply your mannequin conditioner; easy on..easy off..(I am teaching myself how to apply eye shadow..with the aid of a learn how to apply make up book) and this celebrity massage and makeup item works well.. She feels interesting too.she is, &amp;#34;the perfect client&amp;#34;.-deb.</li>
    <li> Everything was perfect until I used black Wolfe paint 😡 also red, now my mask is all stained.</li>
    <li> I hate it doesn&#x27;t wash off paint</li>
    <li> Great to paint with, but it does stain (mostly with red and black that I found). I was using Snazaroo face paints. Any suggestions on how to fully get the stains off would be welcome.</li>
    <li> Terrible for makeup application.  This should not be used for Makeup Practice... Smudges, hard to come off, hard to blend with.  Terrible!!!</li>
    <li> Great to practice facials, make up application, eyelash extensions, etc. Good quality. Large enough to be almost life size. I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t roll around like other mannequin heads.</li>
    <li> Works for what I needed</li>
    <li> Shipping was super fast, I ordered it for eyelash extensions this was the cheapest one i could find Im glad i made this purchase i would def recommend for eyelash extension practice . . .</li>
    <li> I love this make-up face, use it for practicing face painting.  The clean-up is a breeze with no stains left behind if you first use regular wipes, then take Mr. Clean Magic Eraser and dip into alcohol and scrub the stains off.  So easy to do, I just love it.</li>
    <li> I used this when I took my practical test for esthetics. Much easier to carry in the testing room than the full head and a great price too!!</li>
    <li> I was unsure about buying this, but it works great to adhere false strip lashes onto for practice. I do think the forehead is a touch to prominent, but it&#x27;s not an issue for what I&#x27;m using it for.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re going to buy this item for make up or face painting practice, you&#x27;d better also load your cart with a strong solvent--turpentine works, acetone is better--because, yes, it stains badly.  I wanted this to practice face painting, and even Snazaroo stains the surface (and face painters know that Snazaroo paint is the easiest to remove).  Wolfe paint might as well be Sharpie marker--if you use it, it&#x27;s there to stay.  The solvent and lots of elbow grease is an okay solution, but even that won&#x27;t remove all the stains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a shame.  It actually responds a lot like skin when you paint it, but I don&#x27;t recommend it because of the difficulty of cleaning.</li>
    <li> I purchased this dummy, affectionately named &amp;#34;Curly,&amp;#34; so that I could practice my facial massage techniques, etc., any time, any place. This was PERFECT. The head fits on any table, lap desk, etc., which allowed me to practice technique without having to pester friends and classmates. I never attempted putting actual product on it (it seemed like a waste), so I cannot comment on how well this did or did not take product.</li>
    <li> This product is great for perfecting the flow of your facial massage for estheticians! I purchased it before state boards so I could practice and be sure I had fluid motions. I&#x27;m happy to say I passed the boards a few years ago and still use this product now to try out new things or refresh my technique without using a client.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not anything like putting makeup on a person.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again. It didnt really work for my needs as the face isn&#x27;t even remotely like real skin.</li>
    <li> Thanks Amazon the massage and make-up face is the best!!!!!!! This is something that helped me to pass my esthetics practical exam. I would recommend to my friends. Thank&#x27;s agin Amazon....</li>
    <li> I was expecting this to be something I could really practice on but the face texture is the same as my mannequins I got in cosmetology school. Definitely not easy to clean and the makeup doesn&#x27;t show up richly. Don&#x27;t like it one bit. Waste of money in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Stains easily and is hard to clean, but works for what I need it for.</li>
    <li> NONE of the make up comes off! it stays on. even when I bleach it, i tried everything but nothing works.</li>
    <li> I love this, I use the plastic face molds just in case a color doesn&#x27;t come off.</li>
    <li> I love mine! I also like that it seems to be about the same size as a CHILD&#x27;s face, because I use it for Face painting practice. Only thing is that I wish it had eyebrows and a hairline to help me learn how to work my design around real faces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t want it to stain...you can either spray it with hairspray before each time you use it or use 100% acetone and a cotton pad to remove the stain. I suggest cleaning it up right after you use it and not let it sit overnight or for days with product. I wipe the majority of the paint off with baby-wipes first, then use the acetone to remove the stains.</li>
    <li> When I first got this face I was extremely satisfied but after a few uses I started to notice the material the face is made out of was starting to crack.  This wasn&#x27;t a huge issue, but it steadily got worse to the point that it was unusable.  I would have given this face 1-star for quality, but for the price point it is still a value in my opinion.</li>
    <li> It worked for what i needed it for!</li>
    <li> We bought it for Eyelash seminar and it was a great buy.  It&#x27;s stable on the table and easy to apply false lashes.  Great buy for the price!</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Stains a bit with face paint, snazaroo is the best for it. Use A LOT of hairspray before use and 91% alcohol after to help prevent staining. Great price, would recommend to beginning face painters</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really fit my need but decent product</li>
    <li> A great help for me when I was doing my facial exams, test, and check-out. Easy to write the muscles and nerves on the face. Works great flat or using with a stand. The face feels almost realistic. I haven&#x27;t used it for make-up application, so can&#x27;t comment on that.</li>
    <li> Grate stuff! Very comfortable to practice massage movements and eye lash extensions!</li>
    <li> I bought this to practice face painting techniques. So far it works really well, The face does stain (especially with reds) but I just stick with other hues (which don&#x27;t stain as much like yellows, blues, greens and white. The light stains left behind really don&#x27;t bother me too much. I tried to remove them with acetone as others had suggested but it doesn&#x27;t work the face still looks like it went out in the cold and got flushed really badly. But for practicing your strokes and new designs it still works fine. Once you put on the paint the stains aren&#x27;t really a problem they don&#x27;t show through. I do not recommend using a lot of red though I think it would quickly become a problem as it really doesn&#x27;t come off well at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a massage therapist I can say that were one to use this as it was intended, as a massage face, I think it would be excellent as it offers an excellent smooth gliding surface to practice your techniques.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, for the price I say this is a good buy.</li>
    <li> Taking an eyelash extension coarse and this is working out perfect not to mention The price is fantastic! A++++ +</li>
    <li> I know these make-up faces have a tendency to discolor.  So I should not have been surprised when this one discolored from the quality face paints that I used for practicing.  I wish I had bought a more expensive model that does not discolor.</li>
    <li> It was exactly as described and arrived quickly in time for a birthday present. Not sure how it handles make up as I bought it for someone else.</li>
    <li> Nice but dark face paint colors stain it.</li>
    <li> My daughter received this item and I am going off of her feedback on this item to let you all know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the pro&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;easy to hold&lt;br /&gt;once the makeup is placed it stays on very good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the con&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;makeup doesn&#x27;t clean off very well&lt;br /&gt;makeup doesn&#x27;t show up good until you cake it on with a few layers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;all in all this is a good toy for a young girl to do makeup on to save all the dolls in the house, but my daughter says she would not recommend this for someone who is older and needs more of a practice face then a toy.</li>
    <li> I bought this for practice face painting and on the first try the black face paint stained it.  I am using face paint made exclusively for faces and it seems to be only the black that won&#x27;t wash off.  I&#x27;ve tried soap, Magic Eraser, Fantastic, and lots of elbow grease.  Unless someone can offer a solution, I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I purchased 2 of these mannequin heads for use during my Arkansas Esthetician&#x27;s Practical Exam, and they were just what I needed! The flat back fit snuggly over my &#x27;Manikin Holder&#x27;, and stayed in position without shifting during the exam. I am surprised that so many people have considered these heads &#x27;child face&#x27; size...I would say they&#x27;re slightly bigger than that. I have large hands/long fingers, and managed to manipulate the &#x27;skin&#x27; of the mannequin with relative ease. The &#x27;flesh&#x27; of these heads has a silicone FEEL to them--not rubbery. Cosmetics wipe away cleanly, if not left on the faces for more than a couple of hours--so for long-term modeling of your work, I would not suggest this product. Nor would I recommend these for &#x27;face paint&#x27; application. Because I only use my heads for about an hour at a time, before completely cleaning them, they have served me well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I still managed to ruin them both--after my practical I placed both mannequin heads into a suitcase, where a small amount of water spilled on the inside material. Well, the inside material of the suitcase is BLACK, and it appears that dye from that material TRANSFERRED onto both faces, and after trying every product known to man, NOTHING will restore them. When I say NOTHING, it is no exaggeration. I tried Dawn dish soap, concoctions of baking soda, vinegar, toothpaste, Goof off and Mineral Spirits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, for the price, these mannequin heads cannot be beat! They are decently sized and feel pretty close to real skin. Just bear in mind, they WILL STAIN if pigmented products are left on them for more than a couple of hours at a time. Short of that, I would definitely re-purchase these!</li>
    <li> Trying to use for face painting practice but can&#x27;t was off paint. Stains remain after using alchohol and fingernail polish remover and eraser sponges.</li>
    <li> Should have listened to the other reviews and bought something else. Make up will NOT come off. Had to buy a better one.</li>
    <li> I bought for a friend getting into party face painting. She loved it for practice.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect and got here fast. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I look forward to working with it when i do not have a model to work with and is a good add on to my makeup trunk.</li>
    <li> While affordable, if using for face paint your deeper hues will NOT wash off.... at all. I would not suggest this item for cake makeups and paints.</li>
    <li> Perfect size! Arrived on time. Packaged nicely. Excellent quality.</li>
    <li> Perfect for lash extension practice. And soft.</li>
    <li> Make up is very hard to get off this face so a little disappointed.  My daughter loves loves makeup and making up everyone so I thought I would get this but again hard to clean off</li>
    <li> Now I can practice all of my makeup techniques on someone who will not complain!!!  Easy to clean, remove make-up with baby wipes or Lysol wipes.</li>
    <li> Item was just as described! I love it!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this some time back along with its accessory face + sheets of lips and eyes, all of which can be laid flat on a table. I received no instructions as to the care and maintenance. I&#x27;ve googled the manufacturer&#x27;s site to no avail. They don&#x27;t tell you how to care for them. And so...I&#x27;ve not actually tried to put makeup on the face or pallets as I&#x27;m afraid it will permanently stain (someone told me it&#x27;s made of vinyl) as my vinyl dolls did a half century ago when I would put on their \\&quot;makeup\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, I like the concept, which is why I give it 3 stars. If this can be used over and over with cleaning, it would indeed, be a great product. It just needs to come with a little bit of information on the care it needs. Perhaps one day when I can accept the fact that after a one-time application of makeup, I may have to throw out, I will test it.</li>
    <li> The set is great for beginners, but the make up didn&#x27;t come off easily. The slip on mask goes on great.</li>
    <li> I ordered this make up face so that i can practice my face paint.... big mistake it doesn&#x27;t come off!!!&lt;br /&gt; ...so i decided to use it for what it was intended for...and as well it doesn&#x27;t come off ...i drew eyebrows with my eyebrow kit and it stained the face....i&#x27;ve tried to scratch it off,rub it off and its stained... good for light make up nothing heavy or dark... waste of money ...</li>
