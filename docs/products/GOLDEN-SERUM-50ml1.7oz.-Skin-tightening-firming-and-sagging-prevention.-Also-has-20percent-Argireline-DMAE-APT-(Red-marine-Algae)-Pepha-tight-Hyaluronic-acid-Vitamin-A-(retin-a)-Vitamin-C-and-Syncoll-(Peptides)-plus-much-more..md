<li> I have read the reviews both good and bad.</li>
<li> I really don&#x27;t see a big difference in this serum and other serums that I purchased for half the price.</li>
<li> It arrived a few days early, but I saw no difference when I used it.</li>
<li> I have had pufffy, stretched out tissue under my eyes for years.</li>
<li> The swelling is gone and the stretched tissue is tight.&lt;br</li>
<li> My skin feels soft and firm, and lines are minimized.  </li>
<li> Immediate and long term benefits!</li>
<li> Will continue to use as long as you make it!!!</li>
<li> I had several people think I had some procedure done after using this product for a few months.</li>
<li> My skin feels a little firmer and tighter for a few minutes after the serum is applied but the sensation doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
<li> I purchased this item due to the description and that it contained retina.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve felt no tightening effects as I have with other products and my face is dryer than if I just use my Neutrogena lotion.</li>
<li> Sorry, I really wanted to like it.</li>
<li> Others describe this as a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; product and say how tight the skin under their eyes is after using it, but I&#x27;ve been using it under my eyes twice a day for almost two months now and have seen little to no results.</li>
<li> /&gt;However, due to the price of this cream, it is too expensive for me to use every day.</li>
<li> Overall I&#x27;m disappointed with my purchase.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used this along with the Radiance Cream and after a week, my face has broken out.</li>
<li> so it is difficult to say if it will prevent sagging.</li>
<li> this serum is a bit expensive but you will see the difference!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> I no longer purchase the expensive creams and lotions.</li>

    <li> I use this serum twice daily after cleansing and it has been wonderful.  My face and neck look so toned.  Will continue to use as long as you make it!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic. I have had pufffy, stretched out tissue under my eyes for years. Have tried everything and after just  one dab it looks amazing already!!  The swelling is gone and the stretched tissue is tight.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m buying another bottle immediately. Best beauty product I have ever bought!!</li>
    <li> This is yet another product that I wish did what it says it will.  Just go to your local drugstore and get a good moisturizer off the shelf for a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this along with the Radiance Cream and after a week, my face has broken out. I&#x27;ve felt no tightening effects as I have with other products and my face is dryer than if I just use my Neutrogena lotion. Sorry, I really wanted to like it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Golden Serum only for two months, and I can already see a difference. My skin looks somewhat tighter. I use it day and night. All my friends who did not see me sometime commented on it, the tendency to sag is gone.  I recommend this, and will definitely buy more and different products from True Radiance. They are an excellent company, ready to answer all questions immediately, shipped very quickly and provided excellent service.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item due to the description and that it contained retina.  I didn&#x27;t see any visible results after using this for several weeks.  I would not purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy this product since it was a little pricey, but after reading the other reviews I thought it would be a good investment and was excited to try it. Others describe this as a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; product and say how tight the skin under their eyes is after using it, but I&#x27;ve been using it under my eyes twice a day for almost two months now and have seen little to no results.

    <li> This stuff is fabulous. The ingredients are pure and powerful. I notice a difference whenever I use it. Immediate and long term benefits!</li>
    <li> This serum worked pretty well;</li>
    <li> This has improved the fine lines around my eyes because of the 20% Argireline and Hyaluronic acid in this product. I no longer purchase the expensive creams and lotions. They can&#x27;t compare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, due to the price of this cream, it is too expensive for me to use every day.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this product, but it did not deliver.  It arrived a few days early, but I saw no difference when I used it.</li>
    <li> I have only been using it for two weeks so it is difficult to say if it will prevent sagging. My skin feels a little firmer and tighter for a few minutes after the serum is applied but the sensation doesn&#x27;t last very long. You have to remember to shake it well before each application. I really don&#x27;t see a big difference in this serum and other serums that I purchased for half the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a repeat buyer of this product which is the best \\&quot;review\\&quot; I can give.  Nice feel. Pleasant on skin &amp; seems to support skin well.  Very happy with it. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I would not purchase this product again being that I do not see any change in my facial skin.  I feel it is over priced!</li>
    <li> I have bought countless serums, but this one really does work wonders. I had several people think I had some procedure done after using this product for a few months. Really tightens and firms well.</li>
    <li> I bought this serum a while ago with amazing results . I was not sure if it was this one since I was testing different ones to make sure which one worked best.As soon as I started my &amp;#34;research&amp;#34;,my face started sagging and getting more wrinckles around the eyes.I decided to try again the serum (alone)and in days my face changed!!! It sounds like I am exagerating but this is the truth.It is amazing I don&#x27;t even use another cream for my eyes,no need to!! They all have the same ingredients (done a lot of research..) this serum is a bit expensive but you will see the difference!!!&lt;br /&gt;I clean my face every nite,I apply Watts beauty retinol cream,the Golden serum and a mosturizing.I add a sun block in the morning too. That is aaall I need!!&lt;br /&gt;Try it you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> My face is sensitive and most &amp;#34;potions&amp;#34; cause problems. The Golden Serum went on smooth as silk, didn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and made it feel wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;True Radiance had fantastic customer service.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference since I started using it three weeks ago.  I&#x27;ll give it more time and see.</li>
    <li> I found this product earlier this year and have reordered several times.  It does just what it says it will do.  My skin feels soft and firm, and lines are minimized.  There&#x27;s also a healthy glow to my skin.  I like the light feel of the lotion, too.  It dries quickly and pretty much disappears.  I am sure I&#x27;ll be using this for a long time.  Delivery is quick and friendly, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  It is now September 2016 and I am STILL using this product.  I just re-ordered.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. Non greasy, Leaves skin soft and looking great. This is the first time I have used this product and there is a definite difference in tone of skin after first week of use. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have read the reviews both good and bad. My thought on why such opposite reviews is this...if someone has always used creams and moisturizers on their skin the immediate results may not be so drastically noticed. If like me they have just begun to use an anti aging cream then the results could be seen almost immediately. I&#x27;m very pleased and have ordered two more bottles as I&#x27;ve noticed in less than two weeks a healthy glow to my skin less breakouts and the jawline is most definitely firming up. I&#x27;m very pleased. Non greasy and I&#x27;ve just been using at night. Love!</li>
