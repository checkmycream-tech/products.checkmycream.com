      <li>Just ordered three more tubes.</li>
      <li>there&#x27;s more in the tube than</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>I would recommend that you make sure your skin can handle this ingredient before purchasing this product.</li>
      <li>for the first time in 10 years my face is completely smooth, and it&#x27;s a great feeling :)</li>
      <li>So far it has worked wonderfully and I am pleased with the decrease in breakouts and how quickly existing acne is fading.</li>
      <li>better than many other products but not that perfect.</li>
      <li>FAR more effective than toothpaste!</li>
      <li>It was way too strong for my skin</li>
      <li>good for normal acne but not to severe acne people....</li>
      <li>and I really want to love this product too!  </li>
      <li>And, always, always hydrate your skin with an oil free lotion.</li>
      <li>[AND THE &#x27;AHA SOUFFLE&#x27; IS FANTASTIC AS A NIGHT CREAM</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;ve never used Zapzyt before, try contacting the company for a free sample.</li>
      <li>Works great for the occasional zit and my grandkids also use it</li>
      <li>lightly~ hope this helps!!&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is such an amazing product!</li>
      <li>never know when that unexpected zit will decide to make itself known on your face, this is a great product to have at the ready just incase.  </li>
      <li>Works great does get rid of acne, however I could not put up with dry face and having it itch.</li>
      <li>I used this product for some time and liked it very much so obviously wanted more when it ran out.</li>
      <li>night when I have a zit, I clean the area with alochol and apply the cream in the morning wash it off and</li>
      <li>I have used Proactive off and on for many years and that has certainly helped.</li>
      <li>Dries my pipes right up!</li>
      <li>Really really works, make sure you rub it in.</li>
      <li>This treatment gel worked just as well for my mild acne.</li>
      <li>This is super get rid of the acne without over drying.</li>
      <li>This product works great for me just as good if not better than the proactive advanced blemish treatment and for the price you could have a six month supply instead of one lil proactive tube wich only contains 5% benzoyl  peroxide</li>
      <li>i&#x27;ve tried many different products and this is the only thing that has ever cleared up them up completely and perfectly.</li>
      <li>I am not using three times a day as reccomended as I have extremely sensitive skin and tend to be conserative with any new creams, but so far so good no irritation!</li>
      <li>benzoyl peroxide tends to dry out the skin, so if you apply it a lot or have sensitive skin i recommend a good moisturizer too!</li>
      <li>I am just so thrilled to have found a product that actually works like it says it does.</li>
      <li>Its worth a try, but don&#x27;t expect a miracle cream.</li>
      <li>I gave ZapZyt the benefit of the doubt, thinking that maybe this monster was just in a league of its own, but I tried it again when I got a smaller zit</li>
      <li>I was excited to try this product because I have battled blackheads for my whole life.  </li>
      <li>When ever I get a bump I put it right on.</li>
      <li>After several uses, and switching between the product and some basic lotion, my acne did lighten a bit, but it wasn&#x27;t near perfect.</li>
      <li>The use of the scrub first, then the Zapzyt, then the moisturizer has kept me pretty much acne free and less oily better than the Neutrogena line they used to have &amp;#34;customized&amp;#34; to you (for $50 a month!)</li>
      <li>First time I saw it in Maximum Strength.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the only product that worked for him and we tried many of them.  </li>
      <li>&quot; is my husband ;)</li>
      <li>This is my first time reviewing any product .....</li>
      <li>I bought this item after trying many different acne treatment gels that did not work.</li>
      <li>AND IT WOULD COST MORE TO SEND THEM BACK THAN JUST KEEP THEM !!..  </li>
      <li>Although product says it&#x27;s a gel, it&#x27;s more of a white, pastey cream.  </li>
      <li>After a week of using it it dried out my face considerably (in a good way -</li>
      <li>AND THE REVIEWS SEEMED TO BE POSITIVE.  </li>
      <li>I had a sample of this that lasted me over two weeks and is 8 times smaller than one tube of this and in the two weeks of using this stuff my face cleared right up!!</li>
      <li>oil.&lt;br /&gt;But, this product is amazing and the price is a lot less than clearisil and others.</li>
      <li>this did dry my skin out a lil more than proactive also</li>
      <li>this is a super product for people who dont get a lot of acne and just need a spot clear up...</li>
      <li>and I find I tend to break out around that certain time of the month.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t wait to see the results in a few more weeks!</li>
      <li>I have very oily skin</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m 44 and have been using Zapzyt since around 2003 or 2004. I have had troubled acne since I was 11 years old.  I have used so many products and prescriptions its ridiculous!  But, I seriously LOVE this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a mom of 4 teenage sons, I had them use it and it helped clear up their acne within a few days to a week.&lt;br /&gt;However, you must be careful to apply only a thin, light layer to your skin and to rub it in thoroughly.  If you do not do this it will dry your skin out and will also leave white smudge marks all over your face.&lt;br /&gt;Remember, this is NOT meant to be used as a face cream/lotion, use it sparingly and only in areas that you need it.  And, always, always hydrate your skin with an oil free lotion. Acne treatments are meant to dry acne up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. \\&quot;Michael\\&quot; is my husband ;)</li>
    <li> Let me just preface this review by telling you all that I have HIDEOUS skin!  The only upside to having unbearably oily skin is that I do NOT look my 60 years of age.  (Yes - I am 60 and I still break out like a hormonal 14 year old!)  The downside of having uncontrollably oily skin is the constant battle with disgusting pustules.  Like many reviewers here, I have tried EVERYTHING (including two rounds of Accutane in my 30&#x27;s, which worked for a few years and got rid of the cystic problems, but offered no long-term solution).  So, based on many comments that this product is the only thing that worked for a lot of people, I decided &amp;#34;what&#x27;s a few more dollars to give it a try&amp;#34;.  This stuff is GREAT!!  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now, and it&#x27;s done miracles in clearing up an unsightly, stubborn breakout below my mouth (seriously - my pimples had pimples), it keeps my oily skin nice and dry, it does not burn or cause flaking, and I haven&#x27;t had any new &amp;#34;ripe&amp;#34; zyts in several weeks.  Just ordered three more tubes.</li>
    <li> This is my first time reviewing any product .....I love it and Im so happy I bought it. Buy it.....it&#x27;s greattttttttttttt believe me  My acne cleared up overnight and got better</li>
    <li> This product works great for me just as good if not better than the proactive advanced blemish treatment and for the price you could have a six month supply instead of one lil proactive tube wich only contains 5% benzoyl  peroxide only thing proactive gel has on this is that it rubs in to the skin more clear. this did dry my skin out a lil more than proactive also but i use a moisturizer to solve that this is a good product for the price almost sounds too good to be true but it does work as described</li>
    <li> Best acne gel i have ever used!!! I bought this item after trying many different acne treatment gels that did not work. I was suprised at how well it worked and how fast it worked . This gel cleared most of my blemishes overnight!! I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried. It got rid of everything that was wrong with my skin LITERALLY after one use overnight. It&#x27;s a godsend</li>
    <li> This product&#x27;s warning label has the following buried about 3/4 of the way in - \\&quot;may bleach hair or dyed fabrics\\&quot; - this turns out to be quite an understatement.  After all of my bathroom towels, sheets, and pillowcases started showing bleach stains, I started going through various bathroom products trying to figure out what was going on.  Zapzyt was the culprit.  Just dab a bit of this stuff on any fabric, wait a few hours, and it will be white.    If you use this stuff at night before going to sleep, you may want to rinse it off before climbing in bed.  &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> As an adult who still gets acne once in a while I don&#x27;t worry to much about it, but this month I had a terrible break out for whatever reason. I purchased this product washed by face before bed and applied Zapzyt as directed. I couldn&#x27;t believe it, I woke up this morning with no redness and my several blemishes dried up to nothing. I&#x27;ve never encountered an acne product that works so well:)</li>
    <li> I have oily and dry skin (yeah its great...) and I bought this considering many online reviews said it is one of the best. It was very drying and didn&#x27;t necessarily reduce anything overnight. After several uses, and switching between the product and some basic lotion, my acne did lighten a bit, but it wasn&#x27;t near perfect. Its worth a try, but don&#x27;t expect a miracle cream.</li>
    <li> Really helps me when I get pimples)</li>
    <li> I have to rate the product according to my experience. I ended up being allergic to the main ingredient in this product. It was way too strong for my skin and I quickly began to start scratching for no apparent reason to me and having weird burning sensations, etc. on my face. I would recommend that you make sure your skin can handle this ingredient before purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had bad acne for some time and now its coming back again I started using this as soon as I got it and saw results overnight!!!! I&#x27;m so thankful for this product</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT AS I HAVE OCCASIONAL &#x27;ACNE OUTBREAKS&#x27;, AND THE REVIEWS SEEMED TO BE POSITIVE.  I NOW THINK THE REVIEWS WERE WRITTEN BY FRIENDS WHO OWN THE ZAPZYT PRODUCT !!.. WHEN I PUT IT ON, I FELT ABSOLUTELY NOTHING...NO BURNING OR ANY SENSATION THAT I HAD PUT ANYTHING ON !!..   ...AND AS FAR AS HEALING THE PIMPLE AND ERASING, IT THE NEXT MORNING ? [AS OTHERS HAVE CLAIMED IN THEIR REVIEWS]...  IT WAS STILL THE SAME AFTER USING THIS PRODUCT AND NOT HEALING ANY FASTER THAN IF I HAD USED NOTHING !!..   WHAT REALLY WORKS IS OLD FASHIONED NOXEMA AND ALSO THE ALPHA HYDROX PRODUCTS [THEIR &#x27;VANISHING BLEMISH SOLUTION&#x27; AND THEIR ALPHA HYDROX &#x27;AHA SOUFFLE&#x27;], ~~ BOTH WHICH HAVE SALICYLIC ACID IN THEM. ~~  YOU CAN LITERALLY FEEL THE PIMPLE SHRINKING WHEN YOU APPLY THESE PRODUCTS [AND THE &#x27;AHA SOUFFLE&#x27; IS FANTASTIC AS A NIGHT CREAM AND REALLY WORKS MIRACLES ON FINE LINES !!]..  ANYWAY, I UNFORTUNATELY BOUGHT 2 OF THE ZAPZYT !! AND IT WOULD COST MORE TO SEND THEM BACK THAN JUST KEEP THEM !!..  ... TAKE IT FROM ME.. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND INSTEAD, BUY THE ALPHA HYDROX PRODUCTS..AS THEY DO WORK !!..                       judy, from Oakland, ca</li>
    <li> I had gotten terrible acne over the last year, and tried various medicated facewashes, lotions, and other products to no real avail.  Finally I stumbled across this one, and decided to try it out.      After a week of using it it dried out my face considerably (in a good way - I have very oily skin), and I started to see a reduction in the severity of my acne.  My skin sometimes feels a bit itchy with the medication, but that&#x27;s due more to the drying out of the skin than anything, so it&#x27;s tolerable.  I actually changed to applying it once every other day, instead of once a day because it was drying out certain parts of my face too much (but no worries, that was easily fixed with a lotion).    Overall I am seeing results with this product and after almost 2 weeks of use I definitely feel that my acne is clearing up bit by bit.  Can&#x27;t wait to see the results in a few more weeks!</li>
    <li> I came across this product online when I was searching for samples to try. The company sent me .25 oz sample bottle. My 11 yr. old daughter and I have been using it and we are in love! When you discover a pimple coming on, apply a very small amount and rub it in. The very next day, the pimple will be almost entirely shrunk up and you will just feel a dry spot, apply again and by the next day, it is completely gone. We only apply when we feel a pimple coming on. We don&#x27;t apply it all over the face. I have noticed a HUGE difference since using Zapzyt! We are just amazed at this product! I have tried massive amounts of products since I started having trouble acne since I was about 11 years old. I have very oily skin and I find I tend to break out around that certain time of the month. I am just so thrilled to have found a product that actually works like it says it does. I would recommend this highly to anyone who has oily skin and problem acne. It is very strong and does what it says. Use it sparingly in problem areas and when you see a problem trying to take root and you&#x27;ll be good to go. If you&#x27;ve never used Zapzyt before, try contacting the company for a free sample. I&#x27;m almost certain they&#x27;ll send you one and after using it, you&#x27;ll be coming back to Amazon to purchase it. I guarantee it!</li>
    <li> I came across this product a few months ago and decided to try it. I have very sensitive, combination (dry and oily) skin and I would break out quite often. Being a 25 year old girl it was very frustrating and embarrassing. This product dries the areas that have excess oil where zits form. It worked practically overnight! I love this product. My only concern at first was that my face wasn&#x27;t used to it so it dried out very badly but I just started using it every other night. Now I put it on every other day under my makeup and every night before bed. It really has helped me. I keep stocked up at all times! I haven&#x27;t had a breakout in a month!</li>
    <li> After the first night of using this product, I saw an obvious reduction in my pimple.  The pimple was not gone completely, but it was definitley smaller and less visible.  Although product says it&#x27;s a gel, it&#x27;s more of a white, pastey cream.  The main con is that I paid $6.00 for the product on Amazon, and I have since seen the same product in the local dollar store for half the price.</li>
    <li> i have tried everything that there is on the market, including accutane.  nothing worked.  this stuff did the trick my face is the best it has ever been and i did not have any side effects. thanks zapzyt</li>
    <li> i haven&#x27;t had BAD acne since high school, but even as an adult i have always had tons of those annoying, tiny flesh colored pimples scattered across my chin, sides of my face, and upper forehead. i&#x27;ve tried many different products and this is the only thing that has ever cleared up them up completely and perfectly. for the first time in 10 years my face is completely smooth, and it&#x27;s a great feeling :) i dab it on in the morning under my makeup (letting it dry before i put my makeup on) and i also put it on at night before i go to bed. i only target the problem areas, so if i happen to feel a zit coming on in an area i don&#x27;t usually i apply it i just dab some on and it is usually gone the next day. benzoyl peroxide tends to dry out the skin, so if you apply it a lot or have sensitive skin i recommend a good moisturizer too!</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this product on his back acne for years.  First time I saw it in Maximum Strength.  It&#x27;s the only product that worked for him and we tried many of them.  All over the counter.  He&#x27;s 55 so it might work on anyone will body acne.</li>
    <li> Very good product.  Works well.</li>
    <li> This product seems to work better for me then others I have tried.</li>
    <li> It really works, but if you have white sheets put a towel on pillow. It will oxidize your white sheets to yellow</li>
    <li> I like this product! It&#x27;s getting harder to find, it&#x27;s not at Target anymore. I use this at night ...1 of my staples!</li>
    <li> never know when that unexpected zit will decide to make itself known on your face, this is a great product to have at the ready just incase.  Zap zit really works well even in a single night.</li>
    <li> I picked ip a tube of this when I couldn&#x27;t find my usual, more expensive Benzoyl Peroxide foam at the drug store. This treatment gel worked just as well for my mild acne. It took me a while to figure out, but I would highly recommend Benzoyl Peroxide over Salicylic Acid, which usually just made my skin worse.</li>
    <li> better than many other products but not that perfect.</li>
    <li> it dries out your pimples BUT it also dries out your skin. sooo, you need to moisturise your skin (use cetaphil). I use it overnight then i wash it off in the morning. make sure you massage it in and don&#x27;t just leave in on the top of the acne, but AROUND the acne in circular motion. don&#x27;t use it again if your acne is already dry.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this product because I have battled blackheads for my whole life.  I tried the product on the blackheads on my nose and it seemed to help.  However, I was disappointed when I got a monster zit right in the middle of my forehead.  I slathered on Zapzyt at night and expectantly looked at my forehead in the mirror the next morning, only to discover that it was still there and as red as ever.  I used it for the next 2 days, to no avail.  I gave ZapZyt the benefit of the doubt, thinking that maybe this monster was just in a league of its own, but I tried it again when I got a smaller zit and it didn&#x27;t work.      I haven&#x27;t given up on ZapZyt yet because all the other reviewers seem to really love this product and I really want to love this product too!  I will post an update if it starts working for me (fingers crossed) or I figure out what I&#x27;m doing wrong.</li>
    <li> For those who have dry skin, please avoid at all cost.  This will make your skin even drier.  After applying this for three nights, I noticed my skin was relatively dry.  When I wash my face in the morning, it irritating so I applied face moisturizer which did not help moisturized my skin. This is probably due to the active ingredient of benzoyl peroxide even though there is 10% in the tube.</li>
    <li> zit zap came on time before est. arrival date. Product isnt a miracle working but i think works the same as any other pimple cream. Pleased.</li>
    <li> This was effective as a spot treatment but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it all over your face for those with severe acne just because it would be extremely drying and likely painful. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about this was the formula. It says gel but it&#x27;s more like a cream so I can&#x27;t really use it under makeup</li>
    <li> I dont care who you are, waking up with an unsightly blemish can ruin your day. There are so many products on the market that are supposed to help get rid of zits that zapzyt was just another one on the list for me to tackle and wait for results. without needing to go into nitty gritty details Ill break down the pros and cons of this particular treatment:    pros:  1) If you use this product on a daily basis you will notice a decrease in oil in areas that you have problems with. When Im feeling particularly hormonal I will place a small amount in my daily lotion and rub all over my face to help control the oil and bacteria that my skin is coming in contact with,  2) It is very inexpensive. for someone like myself that does not suffer from acne all the time and just has an occasional pimple here or there the size and price are just right  3)many acne medications are too harsh, using acid bases to dry up your blemish, which in turn ALWAYS drys out my face. this product is basically an aspirin substance and I dont wake up with dry patches.  4) there are no miracle creams that make your pimples fall off, and preventative steps are always the most helpful in controlling breakouts. I tested this on a pimple that was fairly deep and painful on my jawline and it reduced the swelling and redness and the next day it was basically gone.     cons:  1) I noticed that after I had rubbed some in, and I was in public, that I had a white outline where it had dried. luckily this was not that noticeable but non the less embarassing when i realized I had gone half my day with weird white chalky stuff on my face nicely highlighting my pimple.   2) This is not available everywhere and I have only seen it sold on Amazon.        this is a solid 4 out of 5 star product!</li>
    <li> This item isn&#x27;t carried in any of the stores near my home. I purchased this on line and have been very satisfied with the quality and the product in helping keep the acne away.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I am a 29 year old female and I&#x27;ve struggled with low to moderate acne since I was a teenager. I have used Proactive off and on for many years and that has certainly helped. After a trip to Mexico in &#x27;07, I developed small bumps that appear like acne all over my forehead that the Proactive does nothing for. I have tried so many products and nothing worked, but Zapzyt did! There are no bumps on my forehead anymore. I have also used it on small zits and it works overnight. This is an incredible product.</li>
    <li> Very good product! Delivered on time!</li>
    <li> This stuff helps me with my zits.  It works !&lt;br /&gt;And there&#x27;s more in the tube than the more&lt;br /&gt;expensive stuff,  and it&#x27;s the same thing !&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I basically lived in the isles of Rite Aid before I found this thing.&lt;br /&gt;If you combine it with a sacylic acid cream is it amazing.&lt;br /&gt;at night when I have a zit, I clean the area with alochol and apply the cream in the morning wash it off and its shrunk.&lt;br /&gt;I repeat everynight until it is completely gone. of course I rub my face in shea butter every morning~ and sometimes bio oil.&lt;br /&gt;But, this product is amazing and the price is a lot less than clearisil and others. it really isnt a bad product it is the SAME as clearisil&lt;br /&gt;just less money. (SAME INGREDIENTS) don&#x27;t be fooled by impaitent and oblivious people. this product works!! :)&lt;br /&gt;and if you apply it during day time be sure to rub it in good and apply a moisturizer over it lightly~ hope this helps!!&lt;br /&gt;this dosent cure dark spots but it will have yuor face smooth within weeks~ (for me 1 week... for you; mabye more (3weeks?))</li>
    <li> dry skin... good for normal acne but not to severe acne people.... recommend to see doctor and have acutane pill..</li>
    <li> Am sorry,this product doesn&#x27;t work.i started applying little quantity on my face on the first two days. it just made my acne dry up at the surface but it didn&#x27;t totally get rid of it. i even tried massaging it in to see if it would work better.</li>
    <li> it works really well. My son love it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Really really works, make sure you rub it in.</li>
    <li> Dries my pipes right up! FAR more effective than toothpaste! When ever I get a bump I put it right on. It keeps me from messing with the bump and also gets rid of them!</li>
    <li> I had a sample of this that lasted me over two weeks and is 8 times smaller than one tube of this and in the two weeks of using this stuff my face cleared right up!! This is the only acne cream that has ever worked in such a short period of time I mean you can see a difference in less than a week! You just have to try this stuff</li>
    <li> So this stuff is strong like they say, yes it will dry out your skin and make it itch if you over use it, I used it twice a day now I use it every other day or as a spot treatment. Works great does get rid of acne, however I could not put up with dry face and having it itch. So I decided to use it as a spot treatment and i like it. I will buy again when I run out.</li>
    <li> I used this product for some time and liked it very much so obviously wanted more when it ran out. Sadly they seem to have changed the formula from a clear gel to a white cream. In my opinion it does not work as well.  Before it had a bit of a sting as an astringent and dried out a acne pore quickly. Now the cream does not seem to sink into the skin but rather layers the top.</li>
    <li> On the warning label it says &amp;#34;may bleach fabric&amp;#34; well they aren&#x27;t kidding.  I used this daily for about a month and a half and it subsequently bleached everything my face came into contact with during that time, even when it was thoroughly rubbed into my skin.  My clothes (some irreplaceable), my towels, my bed sheets all unsalvageable and tons of money wasted.  I had more breakouts on the product than without so it didn&#x27;t even work for me to even out the fact all my stuff was destroyed.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone.  Even if it does work for you, not worth the damage.</li>
    <li> Works great for the occasional zit and my grandkids also use it</li>
    <li> Pros: It definitely makes your pimples smaller and prevents new ones from popping up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: it will dry out your skin and leave a dry white powder on your face. So you should use it before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed that i clogs my pores and makes it visibly bigger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;yes it helps your acne but it dries out your skin A LOT and clogs pores.</li>
    <li> this is a super product for people who dont get a lot of acne and just need a spot clear up... This is super get rid of the acne without over drying.</li>
    <li> So after seeing SabsBeauty on YouTube use this product, I purchased it on Amazon for about $5 and have been using it 1x a day ever since along with St. Ive&#x27;s Green Tea scrub and Olay&#x27;s B12 Clarity Cream. The use of the scrub first, then the Zapzyt, then the moisturizer has kept me pretty much acne free and less oily better than the Neutrogena line they used to have &amp;#34;customized&amp;#34; to you (for $50 a month!) ever did. My skin is very oily, and this helped to eliminate it as well as keep my skin clear.</li>
    <li> This is such an amazing product! it cleared up my skin relatively fast and prevented breakouts. My only problem with this is that it dried out my skin like no other. The whole bottom portion of my face was peeling. If you do end up getting this product make sure you have a really good moisturizer to help prevent dryness.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product to combat acne both for my face and body (arms shoulders etc) So far it has worked wonderfully and I am pleased with the decrease in breakouts and how quickly existing acne is fading. I am not using three times a day as reccomended as I have extremely sensitive skin and tend to be conserative with any new creams, but so far so good no irritation!</li>
