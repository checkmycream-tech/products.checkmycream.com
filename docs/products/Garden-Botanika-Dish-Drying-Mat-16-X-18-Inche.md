<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I put them under my rinse trays.  They keep the counter dry and has stopped any mildew and mold issues.  Wonderful</li>
    <li> In combination with an in-skink drainer, using these drying mats helped free up counter space for preparing meals. After a few uses just throw them in the washing machine. You no longer have to scrub the water stains off those plastic drainer mats!</li>
    <li> I use these mats everyday.  I couldn&#x27;t live without them.  I do use at least 2 or 3 at a time especially with roasting pans.  However, these exact mats are only $4.99 at Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond.  I have purchased at least 12 of these mats and given them as gifts.  I always have a couple extra when the others are being washed.  I have NEVER had mold issues.</li>
    <li> The Garden Botanika works for areas not anticipated and I&#x27;ve now purchased 3 sets (9 mats). If you need a fairly large dish drying mat, I think this is a good choice.  At minimum, I think the value is good considering you get three large mats. I also use them on scratchable office surfaces like desks and file cabinets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the material and texture, this mat dries faster than most towels.  Like all such mats, it needs to be allowed to dry completely or it will get moldy.  But this mat is machine washable.  The product packaging instructs one to wash frequently in machine wash cold water and to tumble dry low (do not iron).  One of my mats is fraying at the edges as a result of washing/drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I don&#x27;t think this mat, once used, is all that visually appealing.  For example, as a permanent fixture it&#x27;s not as nice-looking as my bamboo cutting board next to it: [[ASIN:B000MD804I Architec The Gripper Bamboo Cutting Board, 11 by 14-Inch]]. However, it looks tidy and can enhance a clean look for the area around the kitchen sink or anywhere else.  It&#x27;s not easy to make a functional dish drying mat look attractive.  Plastic mats that drain into the sink don&#x27;t always look like something out of Home and Gardens either and yet they serve a purpose.  This mat, in my opinion, looks better than a plastic mat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about this type of mat is that it can be used for so many things.  It can be used to dry glasses, pots and pans.  It can be used under a blender or even for under dish brushes and things like that close to the sink.  If nothing else, you can protect your counters from various forms of abuse.  I bought a second set to use on the upper left corner of my desks at work and home.  This last use is quite handy because my desks are easily scratched, and the mat allows an area on which to throw keys and other items without having to take so much care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The more I use these mats, the more I tend to like their appearance.  To me that&#x27;s a signal that this product is excellent.earance.  To me that&#x27;s a signal that this product is excellent.</li>
    <li> I first saw these when my Mom bought some for my Grandmother. I use them to sit my babies bottles on to dry. They are really soft and absorbent. I wish they made them bigger I would use them in the bathrooms. I love them.</li>
    <li> I prefer hand washing my dishes and I lay them on this dish drying mat to air dry. The mat soaks up so much water and dries rather quickly. You can throw it in the wash if it becomes grimy. Mine seems to attract mildew (and we certainly don&#x27;t want that on our clean dishes!) so I just throw it in the wash whenever I am doing laundry. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this on Amazon since it can be bought for half the price from the manufacturer&#x27;s website or elsewhere. It is, however, worth every penny. I would pay Amazon&#x27;s price if I HAD to.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been very happy with these drying mats.  I just need to buy three more so that we can swap them out more frequently. (The best part has been a complete lack of water spreading onto the floor!)</li>
    <li> My friend has one of these mats and I just knew I had to have one! It&#x27;s very soft &amp; super absorbent. Love it! Great price for a three pack. I use one in my kitchen and one under my dogs dishes to catch any water she may not get into her mouth.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B002OEBYZU Garden Botanika The Original Dish Drying Mat, 16 X 18 Inches (Pack of 3)]]This is the best dish drainer ever! Cleaning up after a kitchen remodel, we hand washed dishes nonstop for several hours and it absorbed every drop. When I picked it up, it was perfectly dry underneath. I leave it out on the counter under the ceiling fan and it dries quickly. Most of the time I don&#x27;t even bother with the dish drainer. I just wash the dishes and lay them on the mat. Three come in the package, so I can run one through the washer and let it air dry while having two clean ones on hand. I&#x27;m buying another set as a gift.</li>
    <li> I admit I am a one person household.  And my work provides me with dinner.  I got tired of the plastic dish rack with tray that I had because it held water and got icky.  It was also difficult to clean well (it required a brush to reach into places).  It also could get icky underneath the tray if water accumulated underneath.  So I got one of these at the local home store.  So far it is working well for me.  As I sometimes accumulate dishes over the weekend, I&#x27;ll have a pretty full dish rack when I do dishes.  And I live in CA where the climate is dry.  I&#x27;ve never gotten this mat soaking wet, either.  So it&#x27;s perfect for my use.  Since I don&#x27;t get it super wet, it stays clean and I don&#x27;t wash it often.  If you have a large family or live in a humid area and the mat is frequently wet, you might want to get a couple of packs of these and swap it a couple of times a week.  I&#x27;m hesitant to give it five stars because I haven&#x27;t seen how well it will hold up with washing.  But if you have habits similar to mine, you&#x27;ll love this mat.</li>
    <li> These towels are very attractive and go well through the wash.  I HAV HAD OTHER MICROFIBER TOWELS THAT ERE ALMOST WORTHLESS AFTER GOING THROUGH THE WASHING MACHINE&gt;  tHEY DO NOT DRY OUT WELL IF LEFT ON THE COUNTER: i WHEN NOT IN USE&amp;lt; I HANG MINE OUT ON THE OVEN HANDLE TO DRY OUT&gt;</li>
    <li> I got these drying mats a couple months ago. I hated the dish drainer I was using and ended up laying a dish towl down to dry large items. After using this mat a couple times my old drainer got donated to charity. I love not taking up counter space. This mat absorbs lots of water. Washing is simple with my other kitchen towels. Now if my husband would stop laying dirty dishes on it...</li>
    <li> I bought these to protect new granite countertops. The problem is, they don&#x27;t dry out properly, even if hung in airy place. They smell of mildew quickly. I have to replace each after one or two uses and wash it in the washing machine. I regret buying them.</li>
    <li> I love the dish drying mats.  They are much easier to pull out and use than an ordinary dish drainer.  Cleaning is also easy, throw in the washer machine on delicate and let air dry.  I tell all my friends about these.</li>
    <li> I bought my first ones before Christmas and gave as a gift and everyone liked them.  Then I found them on Amazon and bought some more!</li>
    <li> The Dish Drying Mat not only looks better but outperforms any other alternative. Amazingly simple.  Amazingly useful.</li>
    <li> I hate the standard dish-drainer trays; in Florida weather, they are constantly getting mildew from all of the moisture in the air.  I was actually looking for a decent looking bath mat, to cut in two, when I found these!!  I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THEM!!  There is no leaking onto the counter, and the mat dries in a matter of hours.  You won&#x27;t be sorry you bought these, and you can&#x27;t beat this price!</li>
    <li> Product is exactly as advertised.  It is ok.  I haven&#x27;t used it alot.  I bought 3 different dry mats and I prefer another. It absorbs water well.  There is nothing about this product that is different from advertised or bad, it is just not the one I use the most.  I feel like I need to put in the washer everytime I use it.</li>
    <li> I bought one of those simplehuman dish drainers [[ASIN:B002CTZVRY simplehuman Dish Rack, Compact, Plastic, Black]] that has the spout that funnels dishwater directly into the sink so i didn&#x27;t need a traditional dish draining mat. I just wanted a mat to put on the counter to drain extra glasses, pans, etc that didn&#x27;t fit in the drainer. Most of the super absorbing mats I found were too brightly colored for my tastes, this one caught my eye because of its natural appearance. And the fact that 3 come in the package is a great bonus! I can always put a fresh mat out while one or two are in the laundry. I&#x27;ve never put the mat to an ultimate test of water holding capacity, but when i put my wet glasses or pots on it to drain there is never ANY leakage to my counter top. Plus they dry quickly and never smell of mildew like my washcloths do after a few days. 5 stars for this product!</li>
    <li> This dring mat is great, until it develops MOLD !!!!!! Then you have to throw it out....not happy with this product !!!</li>
    <li> LOVE these things! I lay them all out when doing dishes, and I have triple the space to put dishes out to dry. No more stopping my washing to put previous dishes away to make room for the next set. These dry quickly when hung, and machine-wash nicely.</li>
    <li> My daughter recommended this item to me and it&#x27;s great.  We have three dogs so I&#x27;m always rinsing dogs dishes, etc., and put them on the mat to dry.  I can see where mold might be a problem if you live in an area with high humidity; I put my mat on the oven rack (I put the rack on my counter) to thoroughly dry each night when I&#x27;m done in the kitchen.</li>
    <li> Nice product and value. (notice pack of 3) It really works great! Super underneath a drying rack or any handwash items.</li>
    <li> Bought this item to be used in an RV and it is perfect---keeps water off my floor, and drys very quickly</li>
    <li> This item is one of the best kitchen items I have every bought.  I never have to throw a dish towel down to put a dish or china on because I have this mat sitting next to my sink.  The nice thing about it is the cushion.  You aren&#x27;t clanging dishes on the the counter.   I love the price too. You get 3 for the price of one and it is a super saver item.  When I saw the price I bought 15 mats and gave them to my friends for Christmas gifts.  They all commented on them and love them.</li>
    <li> Been using this under a dishrack on a high shelf .... kinda odd but keeps dishes drying but out of the way.    Works great... feels great...highly recommended.</li>
    <li> kept one for myself, gave one to my daughter, and gave one to a friend and we all love them</li>
    <li> These mats are worth every penny :). I have 4 of them, 3 from this purchase and 1 from a gift, in the garden window of our kitchen. I lay out items to dry there each day and it works like a dream. Plus they don&#x27;t look too bad either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can pretty much say for certain that anyone who buys these will be happy with their purchase :).</li>
    <li> This is just a foamy pad. A towel would have worked the same, but my biggest complaint, was that one of them had a coffee stain!  Come on guys.  If you are going to resell something, at least make sure it looks new or get an outlet going!</li>
    <li> These drying mats are really thick and do the job, but they are usable for lots more than just drying. I am using one in my jewelry crafting because of the thick padding and the textured surface - it keeps my beads from rolling around. I will probably get one just for my watercolor painting too - save practically an entire roll of paper towels for each painting (lol). I am *seriously* thinking about getting the biggest one they have for the side of the tub in my son&#x27;s bathroom - he&#x27;s quite splashy! I highly recommend these mats.</li>
    <li> Bought these on a whim and wound up giving them as gifts they are super absorbant and so easy to care for.</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with this purchase.  I needed something handy to air-dry my fine cookware and dishes.  Looks neat on the counter, better than the old folded towel I used to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good value, too!</li>
    <li> I initially wanted to use this product for my dishes, but as it turns out...it works well for all of my things. I have one for my dishes and one for the baby bottles. Since there&#x27;s nothing to drain the water from underneath the baby bottles, I put this on the bottom and it works like a charm!</li>
    <li> If all you want to use this for is drip-drying 3 or 4 items, its fine. However, it does mildew on the counter-top side, crumbs and such stick to it and won&#x27;t just brush off. It launders well.</li>
    <li> I love this Mat!  1. Great price for dish drying:  you can buy a cheaper dish drying rack but for the space you get(3 altogether), it is a great price.  2. Fast drying and quick absorbing: It captures all the drippings from the dishes.  3. The best part is when I don&#x27;t have anything to be dried,I can just fold these Mats away and then I WILL HAVE NICE &amp; CLEAN COUNTER. AND MORE COUNTER SPACE!!!  4. I&#x27;m glad I got 3 mats(you can still buy individual or different color or even bigger size from the company&#x27;s website or store) because I can still use a dry mat while the wet one is hung to dry.  5. I have a dishwasher like everyone does so I hardly ever handwash plates and cups. I handwash big pots, pans or big mixing bowls and they take lot of space and it is hard to stack them onto the dish drying rack.-so at the end, they all sit on top of the counter!  This is why I got rid of my $69(What was I thinking?) Simple Human dish drying rack(which looked nice but now I wish I had known about these mats).  6. Easy to clean -machine wash! What else can I ask for? Any kind of dish drying rack needs to be cleaned regularly (specially with hard water like ours)and if not, it looks yucky. For me, it was just one more thing to do. Throwing rags into the washing machine is way easier!</li>
    <li> These new dish mats rule! When you must wash pots and pans, glasses, dishes, flatware or the like, just put them on the dish mat instead of a dripping dish drainer. By the time you get around to putting your wet things away, all you need do is give a swipe with a dish towel and all is dry. Then just hang the dish mat out to dry. (We hang it on a hook next to a light)  It holds an amazing amount of water without dripping or sopping everything in sight.  That is, no matter how many objects were placed on it wet, it never once dripped or made a puddle. We first used these on a camping trip. There are no dishwashers in motor homes--or at least in our motor home, but the dish mats came through all the time. I originally bought one of these.  Now I have 4 and love each one.  Just remember not to use softener when you launder them. It interferes with their ability to hold water.  I&#x27;d say they hold more than their weight in water.  Amazing.</li>
    <li> Great buy and works great! No water leaves the mat and the wash up like a dream!! Fits right under my drainer!! Like the 3 for 1 price!!!</li>
    <li> This was advertised as bamboo, but is all fabric and not at all wood.  It just has a bamboo pattern on it and I thought really ugly and that the description was completely off. I returned it.</li>
    <li> This is the best drying mat and it comes in a set of 3. However i found out that you can get just one at the container store so its up to you</li>
    <li> I use these instead of a drip drainer for my dish rack. It works great and I never have any issues with it not drying fast enough or water seeping through. The 3 pack is great because it lets me rotate the mats when one gets dirty and needs to be washed, they are also great for when I have a lot of dishes and they don&#x27;t all fit on my dish rack. I just lay one down on the countertop and start stacking. The size perfectly fits under my dish rack so no complaints there.</li>
    <li> I find I use one or two at a time.  Then switch to letting them dry and grabbing the last.  They work great, dry fast and are thicker than I expected.  I won&#x27;t go back to plastic.  We have a trailer and these will also be great for use in it.  They don&#x27;t seem like a great gift but I think you&#x27;d be surprised at how useful and easy to put away they are, also how often you&#x27;d reach for one.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after seeing it at my son&#x27;s house.  He and his wife are very eco-conscious, and I knew that it would be worth a try.  I bought 3 and use two in the kitchen.  I am going to give the other one to my sister for her to try.  I think it is a great alternative to putting out dish towels, and it&#x27;s so compact and easy to whisk out of sight when you&#x27;re done.  I haven&#x27;t experienced any mildew problems, but that&#x27;s probably because I air them out between uses.  So far so good.  I like it.</li>
    <li> I bought the pkg of 3 and kept one and gave one to my daughter and my daughter-in-love. These things are fabulous! I saw one mat at my friend&#x27;s house and just had to have one for myself! I highly recommend the product and the seller.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using these for a couple days and I do like them thus far for the most part, they are attractive enough and dry pretty quickly.  My only concern is the odor from the foam.  You can smell it when they&#x27;re brand new, I&#x27;d hoped it would go away after washing and it did somewhat but it still is there in cups left upside down to dry on mats.  So, I&#x27;m not drying cups and such upside down on them and all is well.  Just thought I&#x27;d leave a heads up for other folks on here checking these out.  I&#x27;ve used a bakers cooling rack with a towel beneath it to dry items before and maybe that is still the better way to go.  I&#x27;ll try to remember to update this review if the foam stink disappears with time and use. . .or if it doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foam stink has gotten better but I still don&#x27;t dry cups upside down on it.</li>
    <li> I love these drying mats. I have two in the cream color and one with a holiday \\&quot;holly\\&quot; border, too. They quickly absorb water from my washed dishes and they look nice on the counter top. Sometimes, after I wash my hands, I just press them once on these mats, and they are dry. I love &#x27;em and I love to give them as gifts! They are so handy and useful.</li>
    <li> I love this drying mat. I saw this at Bed, Bath, &amp; Beyond for the same price but the package only came with one mat. I found this on amazon and for the same exact package and product youg et three! Talk about a deal! The mat soaks any dripping water from my dish rack and looks good on my counter as well! And it is machine washable so you can keep it clean! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> We purchased these mats because we had already owned one and liked the job it did.   I decided to buy this package of 3 but when it came we only received 1 so we are returning and hopefully going to get the right amount in the next order.</li>
    <li> i loves these! there washer machine safe. hold any water the drips off dishes and i even spilled water in counter and it sucked it up when i picked it up to ring out NO water dripped out the side. i ordered three just to test them out but going to get more! so i can switch them out with out having to wash them every time</li>
    <li> Mold city.  This is great for maybe a few weeks and then it needs laundering.</li>
    <li> Wow, what a lifesaver these have been!!  The tray under my dish drainer was useless.  None of the water went back into the sink, just on to the counter top.  My counter top has been bone dry since putting these mats under the disk drainer instead!  I&#x27;m so pleased.  I switch back and forth between two of them every time I empty the drainer, leaving one to hang to dry.  They do not get moldy or smelly (which I was fearing, living in damp and dreary Pacific Northwest).  They wash and dry beautifully, too.    The only way these could be any better is if they came in a variety of colors.  Everything in my kitchen is blue and white, but these work so well that I don&#x27;t even care that they don&#x27;t \\&quot;match\\&quot; the decor.</li>
    <li> We used to have the typical plastic bottom that got all dirty and water pooled and dried with crud on it.  Also, underneath the plastic bottom it was always kinda gross.  We got these and love them.  We put our dish dryer on it.  We wash it weekly and is great.  It&#x27;s absorbent and looks a bit nicer.</li>
    <li> I have bought several sets of these mats. Typically, I use them under my dish drainer and next to the drainer for overflow dishes that don&#x27;t fit. I also keep one under my dog&#x27;s bowl to catch drips. She&#x27;s a large dog, and this keeps puddles off the floor around her bowl. I wash them on a regular basis and have both dried them in the dryer and hung them up to dry. They come out clean each time, and I&#x27;m very pleased with them thus far. I&#x27;ve been using them for approximately four months now, and I can tell that the ones I have washed frequently are not brand new, but they are holding up well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very impresses with these dish drying mats!  They look great, work great and when one gets too soggy, I throw it in the wash and replace it with another.</li>
    <li> I own a cleaning company and i see them in many of the homes i clean. Had to buy for myself &amp; the value is cost efficient</li>
    <li> I got one of these as a gift and don&#x27;t know how I ever got along without it.  I wash a small amount of stemware and crystal by hand pretty much daily.  This little mat is perfect for setting your glassware down before the final wipe dry. It is perfect for air drying anything too delicate or awkward for the drying rack.  I also set my good knives here before I wipe them off... safer and no damage to knife blades.  I have ordered another of these to use by our bar sink as well.  The thickness of the mat makes it much nicer and more efficient (greater air flow) than using a towel laid out on the counter and it looks nice when not in use.  I have washed it the washing machine and it cleans up like new.</li>
    <li> Even those with dish washers will want one of these Original Dish Drying Mats. Super absorbent and super economical - individually, they cost as much as a good quality towel but with 5 times the absorbency. Place one under your dish rack on the counter or just lay on counter and drip dry those larger items that won&#x27;t fit in your dish washer. Especially nice for drying delicate items such as wine glasses or crystal. I highly recommend this product and by buying a pack of three, you&#x27;ll have two to give to family or friends!</li>
    <li> I was so tired of all the mold growing in my dish drainer pan.  It didn&#x27;t matter if it was metal or antimicrobial plastic- there was always mold.  So I threw it out and bought one of these mats.  It&#x27;s great!  It absorbs really well and cleans up well in the washing machine.  It can hold the water from an entire load of hand washed dishes without leaking (though the counter underneath does get wet).  My only complaint is that it shrunk a bit in the dryer and is now not long enough for my dish rack.  If you have a larger dish rack I recommend purchasing the extra large version of this mat from Bed, Bath, and Beyond.  [...]</li>
    <li> I ordered these and returned them almost immediately. I liked the idea of a \\&quot;waffle weave\\&quot; mat that would dry quickly. The product description doesn&#x27;t mention that these are essentially foam covered in fabric, though, and I didn&#x27;t like the texture.  Also, the pad wasn&#x27;t long enough for my bamboo dishrack. The dimensions are correct in the product review; I just expected that all dishracks were a standard size, but that&#x27;s apparently not the case.</li>
    <li> Love this product.   So much better than using towels.   Wish it were a little wider to fit counter width.   I have also used to drain vegetables on.</li>
    <li> I had been using paper towels on my counter top to set my pots and pans on after hand washing them. When I saw these, and the other reviews, I thought I&#x27;d give them a try. They are great! They are cushioned and absorb the water without leaving puddles on my counter(like the paper towels did) They air dry quickly so are ready to use again in a few hours. I&#x27;m glad I purchased them!</li>
    <li> I bought my first dish mat at the store (a dark grey color) and liked it quite a bit, but I found I needed more than one for when I was washing the mat. So I bought this pack. I like them a lot, they&#x27;re a great price and do the same job my first one did. My ONLY complaint is that I wish they came in a darker color. Sometimes I&#x27;ll put something on these that leaves a mark (some older pans), and as soon as I see that mark showing up so well against that beige I exchange the mat. During the first week I have one stubborn black mark that hasn&#x27;t come out yet despite washing the mat twice. I&#x27;ll be specially treating that stain next time I do laundry, and hope it comes out.</li>
    <li> I use these on a regular basis for those dishes I won&#x27;t put in the dishwasher.  They are absorbant and I have not noticed any odor or mold problems as reported by others.  I wash these regularly in the washing machine, but no bleach and no fabric softener. I also line dry weather permitting or dry on an indoor rack in the winter.  So far they have held up very well after over a year&#x27;s use.</li>
    <li> They are good but make sure you dry and wash them occasionally since they can get moldy.  Ta ta !</li>
    <li> I seldom write reviews but I love these mats. Many years ago I used kitchen towels under my dish drainer then I bought a plastic mat that drained into the sink.  Soap scum heaven.  I bought these on a whim and really love them.  They hold a lot of water (the package says they hold 4 times their weight) -- I don&#x27;t know if the package is correct but they&#x27;ve held every drop of water from my dishes.  I don&#x27;t have a dishwasher so all of my dishes are dried by hand -- and I do a lot of cooking every weekend -- resulting in a lot of dishes to be done.  One mat has handled the load.  I usually leave the mat and and drainer on my counter.  The mat blends in with the counter and wouldn&#x27;t be noticeable except for the brown trim. If the mat gets very wet I recommend replacing it as the mats take quite awhile to dry if they get very wet. (Very wet means just that. A normal load of dishes doesn&#x27;t make the mat really, really wet.  If you cook all day as I do on a weekend the mat gets very wet after several large dish-washing sessions.)  One caveat -- these are relatively small mats.  I was going to use my wooden dish rack with the mat but the rack was too big for the mat.  Fortunately the mat is the perfect size for my metal dish drainer. Check the dimensions of your drainer before purchasing.</li>
    <li> I wash these regularly, and even put them on a radiator to dry when damp, but they still mold like it&#x27;s in style.  Yuck.</li>
    <li> My only problem was with glasses--they tipped over and sometimes fell to the floor and broke.  The soft texture and high center of gravity of glasses made them unstable.</li>
    <li> I use a dishwasher for most things, but hand wash my All-clad and copper pots and pans.  I put those in a regular dish drainer, but I don&#x27;t want my nice knives banging around against all the other stuff, so when I wash those I use the drying mat.  I also put things like my stemware and microplane grater on it to dry.  When I&#x27;m done, I just fold it up and put it a drawer.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> does not dry itself out well.....I found after a few months (I bought several) they absorbed water but would not dry out.....then they started to grow mold after one day of dampness.  ICK.  too bad, started out well.</li>
    <li> I have had a number of dish racks over the years, and every one has been hard to clean and ended up disgusting -- moldy, black slime, corrosion, staining, whatever. These dish mats are great -- I throw them in the washer (but not the dryer) when they get dirty or soaked, and they come out clean and ready to use again. I am a fan -- wish I had known about this years ago! Having three means that you can always have a clean one, so buy three! So much easier than scrubbing a rack with a toothbrush :-).</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect since some of the reviews weren&#x27;t great, but I&#x27;ve used the mat for a couple of weeks now and I love it!  I hated dragging the dish drainer out and having it take up so much space.  This mat is quick to pull out and soaks up all the water so it isn&#x27;t running all over the countertop like it did when I used dish towels.  Also, since it is somewhat spongy, things don&#x27;t slide on it.  I find that I can do the dishes, leave them do dry and when I come back to put them away, I just hang the mat so it can air dry for the next round.  One of my favorite purchases!</li>
    <li> I totally like this product. Is a good way to care for your dishes, specially for glasses or delicate china. Machine washable a plus, really absorbent and works well with any kind of decoration in your kitchen.</li>
    <li> This mat is very helpful in a small apartment to supplement small dish rack for larger loads of dishes! Dries quickly. Well padded.</li>
    <li> After having a plastic drying rack that always retained water and got moldy, this product is fantastic! It dries fast, looks nice, and is easy to keep clean. I love it!</li>
    <li> These mats work fantastic - I had no need for 3, so I gave one away and the receipient loves theirs, too. Washable, durable and super absorbent. My only complaint is that they have just enough cushion to sometimes seal wet glasses airtight and they don&#x27;t try. I try to remember to place items in a certain way and/or angle to allow for better &#x27;breathing&#x27;.</li>
    <li> I have tried different brands of mats and have found for the money, this one is great.  Dries quickly, soaks up the water fast and doesn&#x27;t get a musty smell.</li>
    <li> These are wonderful!  I have a very small kitchen, with limited counter/table space.  And I do not have a dishwasher, so they are all done by me, in the sink.  These mats allow me to cover the counter and place the dishes on the mats to dry.  I can put them on the back of a chair to dry, then roll them up and store them in my kitchen cabinet.  I use them constantly.  Gave one to my bachelor son, and he was happy, too -- saves drying all those dishes, I guess.  :)</li>
    <li> The waffle weave in these dryer mats assists quick evaporation. I have a small kitchen and hand wash larger items rather than put them in the dishwasher. The mats have a nice neutral tone with coordinates beautifully with my kitchen decor. They can be washed and bleached when they start to stain without losing the nice light brown border. The pack of three gives me one to use, one to wash and one to spare. They also make excellent hot pads for when you bring a 9 x 13 pan out of the oven. No more huge, plastic drying racks for me.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> In case someone doesn&#x27;t want to buy 3 at once or want to wait for shipping...these are also sold at Bed Bath and Beyond for $4.99 each.    These drying mats are great though. I have more than one so I can change them out here and there. Careful with tall glasses though...the padding is a little thick and it can tip over.</li>
    <li> My wife and I bought this as a gift for my mom and now plan on buying a set for our house as well. These mats are nice an thick and very absorbant. No more throwing towels across the counter. We highly recommended this product.</li>
    <li> For so many years, we&#x27;ve used a dishtowel on the counter to put wet dishes that don&#x27;t fit in the drying rack. It gets dirty and smelly quickly sitting on the counter and it always looked yucky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The addition of these drying mats has been wonderful. They are padded so putting heavy pots and bowls onto it is easy. They dry out quickly and look fresh and clean. There are three in the pack so you can use more than one at a time or have extras for when some are in the wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is neutral enough in color that it doesn&#x27;t stand out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve used it for over two weeks now and it doesn&#x27;t smell or have water stains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for added dish drying space.</li>
    <li> Very nice replacement to that giant plastic thing my Mom had on her counter growing up.  We use it air dry the pots and pans we hand wash.  Folds nicely, and throw in a drawer when not in use.  Washes very easily in washing machine!  I also bought a set for school.  (I am science teacher.)  Great for drying glassware and other items as well!</li>
    <li> These are really great. Easily washable, look nice. Awesome, contagious gift. I saw one at my mom&#x27;s house after her friend gave her one, and bought them as soon as I got home. I gave one away, and his partner bought more and sent them to her friends and family in Israel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this company because the mat is soft on both sides. Some other kinds have a fluffy underside and a stiff, porous top layer to facilitate drying that looks and feels harsh to me. The disadvantage with this one is that it doesn&#x27;t wick water away as effectively as the ones with the harder top surfaces, making drying take longer for items close to the surface.</li>
    <li> Perfect under my dish rack</li>
    <li> This is a very good product at a great price (for a package of three, no less!)  The waffle weave material is thick and the drying cloths are a good size for drying pots on.  I like that I fold them up and put them away when not needed.</li>
    <li> I love these mats so much that I have bought a couple of extras for myself (for overflow dishes after a big dinner) and have given them as gifts to family members.  They seem cleaner than the plastic draining boards that go under the dish rack, and they certainly look a lot better.  Plus, I love being able to pull out an extra to set my china or glasses on.  I&#x27;ve never noticed it being wet other than right after I&#x27;ve put out freshly washed dishes to dry, so I have to think it dries quickly.  I wash it periodically (with no problems), and I&#x27;ve never noticed a smell or any indication that it&#x27;s growing anything inside.  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> We are constantly using the dish drying mats. We do not put our glassware into the dishwasher. The dish mats are a convenient place to let glasses and dishes air dry. The mats keep our granite counters relatively dry. The dish mats are simply more convenient to use and store than a bulkier plastic drying rack.</li>
    <li> So, I have to admit, I had my doubts when I got the Dish Drying Mat. But, my doubts are totally gone! The Dish Mat does exactly what is says - bye-bye wet counter! It absorbs so much water, it&#x27;s amazing.     Since buying the first a month ago, I&#x27;ve bought several more. We rotate them regularly on the counter and got one specifically for our dog&#x27;s water dish (now our floor stays dry too).    AND, at such a great price, I have every intention to give it as part of wedding, hostess and baby shower gifts.     Bottom line - it&#x27;s the bomb, you need one!</li>
    <li> I bought these primarily for stemware, and for those times when the small side of my dual bowl sink doesn&#x27;t hold everything I&#x27;m washing (I have a dishwasher but do a fair amount of hand washing too).  I don&#x27;t use them every day, but they do the job for me.  They are a little spongy, and that&#x27;s why I took a star off.  For most items, that&#x27;s fine, even desirable, but for the lighter stemware the surface is a bit tenuous.  I put the pad in a place on the counter where they won&#x27;t get touched, because the wine glasses don&#x27;t have enough heft to sink into the foam well, and they&#x27;re not as secure as I&#x27;d like.  They&#x27;re not so shaky that I feel the need to return the pads; I just have to be careful.  These mats are not huge, but I like having 3 smaller ones so I can use just what I need.  I always dry them thoroughly before folding and storing them, and have had no problems with mold or cleanliness.</li>
    <li> These mats are a life saver.  I don&#x27;t like the look of a dish drain on my countertop and the hassle of trying to find a place to put it when I&#x27;m not using it.  These mats are wonderful for drying your \\&quot;non-diswasher safe\\&quot; items.  The absorb a ton of water, dry quickly, and look good.  I&#x27;ve already washed mine in the washer and put in the dryer on \\&quot;delicate\\&quot; and they come out as good as new.  They fold up nicely and just slip under your cabinet ready for the next use.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy these mats if you counter dry any dishes in your kitchen.  They are also great for the bathroom and setting your combs and brushes on!</li>
    <li> Makes the countertop look so much neater and cleaner. I got it with the bamboo rack and they work well together.</li>
    <li> I got this 3-pack of dish drying mats plus two of the [[ASIN:B0049PKFUM Kennedy Home Collections Compact Rubberized Coating Dish Rack - Chrome]] for my very cramped kitchen. I&#x27;m using one mat per rack and keeping the third mat stowed away for miscellaneous use. Although the mats roll at the edges a bit, I think this will stop after they have been washed once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I do when I&#x27;ve put away all the dishes is drape each mat over the dish rack it was sitting on. This way, the mats dry quickly and, so far, I have not had any problems with them staying wet long enough to get moldy. Depending on what I&#x27;m washing, I can put two of the racks to a mat and use the other mat for drying glasses, large bowls, or pots. The combo is working for me much better than that awful plastic dish drainer I had before.</li>
    <li> I would have given this item 5 stars because it works great and a three pack makes a lot of sense to me for washing cycles BUT it came in the most ridiculous package! It was huge and just at total waste of resources. Other than that, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I bought these to have extras on hand so I could always have a fresh one ready while the used one was being laundered.  The size is good and it sure holds the water.  The package of three was more than I would have spent in a discount store.  Not sure if it was the same make, though.  Time will tell on how long they last.  But, I&#x27;m happy I bought this product using a gift card.</li>
    <li> These dish mats look very nice when they are new.  They wick away wetness from the dishes.  However, when they get stained, they are very resistant to getting clean again.  We&#x27;ve tried to soak ours in Oxy-clean and put them in the washer.  This removes some surface dirt but stains really don&#x27;t come out.  Therefore, we just replace ours every couple of months.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome and so much better than those bulky pastic dish racks. I saw it at a friends house &amp; decided to check Amazon for it. Great price for all 3 but if you want to save $ you could always keep just one &amp; sell the other 2 as singles on Amazon, then you practically get your 1 for free!![[ASIN:B002OEBYZU Garden Botanika The Original Dish Drying Mat, 16 X 18 Inches (Pack of 3)]]</li>
    <li> Love this mat. Soaks up the water and you can nearly drop the dishes on it as it is nice and thick. It dries fairly quickly...no mildew smell. Very happy with it except for one issue...I&#x27;d love to have been able to choose a different color...dark granite counter, so I&#x27;d like to have had a color choice..</li>
    <li> These mats are great, put you chopping board on one and no noise, use your mortar and pestle and no noise.&lt;br /&gt;They do not sour they wash like a dream. The price was great, since big box stores want 10.00 and up for them.</li>
    <li> I find these drying mats perfect for me. I don&#x27;t care for having drying racks out, so I purchased these as an alternative. This is perfect for drying my pots/pans and other odd items that aren&#x27;t proper for a dishwasher. When I&#x27;m not using them, I can roll them up and put them out of the way. Putting them in the washing machine is an easy way to get them clean. I&#x27;ve owned these since April 2012 and I&#x27;ve not had a mildew/mold issue like others have complained of.</li>
    <li> Purchased these on line and are finding them sooo good.&lt;br /&gt;Had not seen them in any New Zealand shops before but came across them whilst housesitting recently and purchased ASAP.&lt;br /&gt;Really good for the modern homes where they do not have extended bench from their sinks.&lt;br /&gt;Easily laundered and they dry very wuickly.&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this purchase.</li>
    <li> These are easily found at several places, but the three pack was a good deal.  I always have one clean and ready and a second one for dirty days.  I use these on granite counters now.  They don&#x27;t retain moisture and get funky underneath or anything.  They dry well and don&#x27;t get moldy or mildewy at all.  I can wash pots and pans, utensils, etc. and put them on the counter to dry and then toss them out of the way when done.  No unsightly and space consuming dishracks.  They&#x27;ve held up well through several washing machine cycles too.</li>
    <li> I have many of these I use in rotation. They are machine washable so they are quite sanitary. Good for delicate dishware.</li>
    <li> I just love these.  We had a makeshift kitchen in our dining room while we did a complete renovation of our kitchen.  These worked so well that I&#x27;m still using them instead of a drainer for smaller amounts of dishes that I wash.  Recommend these to everyone.</li>
    <li> These are so fantastic. Long gone is the soaked towel on the side of the counter under your newly cleaned skillet. I love that there are three. I love that I can easily tuck them away. Love that they are washable. LOVE.</li>
    <li> It is exactly what I wanted and I love it!  No more broken glasses on my granite work top and no more sopping wet dishcloths!  I previously used this product while we were living in Chile but unfortunately it is not available in South Africa so I was thrilled to find  it on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I saw one of these at my daughter-in-law&#x27;s house and had to have them. They are the best thing going for hand washed dishes, as they dry in no time when put on top of these mats.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but they stain terribly and won&#x27;t come out even with bleach.  I would not recommend this product as they look bad in the kitchen.</li>
    <li> Love these mats.  These are the first ones I have ever gotten so I have nothing to compare them to, yet they seem to be quality material and work great.  I have washed as directed and they come out like new.  I would buy again if I ever need to replace them.</li>
    <li> They are simply great.. I got them because I didn&#x27;t want a dish rack all the time on my counter.. They absorb a lot of water and when not in use you can simply fold and take them away.. My mom was so impressed I got her another set so she could put it under her dishrack.. When dirty I just put them in the washer with the towels and to the dryer.. They hold up pretty good.. I&#x27;ve been using them for almost two years, washed numerous times and they are like new.. I&#x27;m very happy with them..</li>
    <li> I first used the drying mat at a friends house.  It came as a 3 pack (probably 2 more than necessary).  I will pass one on to my daughter and keep one as a spare.  It washes nicely and is extremely absorbent.  And it blends in with my counters.  I don&#x27;t have Granite.  Yes I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> Throw away that old drying towel and use the new Dish Drying Mat  - washable and reusable  - this set of 3 will last many years.</li>
    <li> Have been using these for awhile but my original one got covered in sauce so I figured I&#x27;d buy a new one.  Almost bought a single one for ~$13, then noticed the 3-pack for only a few dollars more.  It&#x27;s a good idea to have more than one so that when you need to wash one, you have spares.  This drying mat is great to cushion dishes from a hard counter top and keeps the area relatively dry.  The mats dry pretty quickly when you hang them up.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> nice microfiber drying mat, easily ordered, came sooner than promised, looks, feels and is exactly like advertised, folds neatly for easy storage when not in use, nice color</li>
    <li> Great product, worth the money. No mildew so far (got 3 for over 9 months) and works much better than just laying cup towels on the counter.</li>
    <li> I bought these about one year ago.  I wash a most of my dishes by hand and place on one of these to dry.  They have worked very well and I have not had any problems.  They absorb a lot of water and dry quickly.  You can always wash them, but I have never had to so far.  I only put clean dishes on them to dry and I occasionally air out the mats if they get really wet (they dry quickly) and so they don&#x27;t really get dirty in use.  I keep the spares in a drawer.  (I live alone so probably don&#x27;t load these up as much as a family would.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A first rate product and a good value.  They could be used for others things as well, I think, as they look nice, and are thick and soft.  I would definitely buy these again and recommend them highly.</li>
    <li> I like these mats for under my dish rack. They take up less counter space than a traditional drainer tray, and don&#x27;t look bad. The only downside is that they stain eventually. The mats can be washed, but eventually the stains become conspicuous enough that it&#x27;s time to toss them and use another. I guess that&#x27;s why they&#x27;re sold in 3-packs.</li>
    <li> These are a great alternative to the plastic tray underneath a drying rack. It allowed me to use both sides of the cup-hooks on the drying rack, and looks much sharper. I accidentally left a wooden spoon on it however, and it molded after a few days. All my fault, just make sure you don&#x27;t leave anything wooden on it for an extended amount of time!</li>
    <li> We keep one under our dish rack, and rotate them into the washing machine from time to time.  A very useful product.</li>
    <li> These are really great, absorbing mats.  We love that they come in a three pack because you can never have too much space for drying dishes.</li>
    <li> They are very cushy and will definitely protect your glasses and stemware! They look great and are very, very absorbent. I&#x27;m really happy with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is actually the packaging they arrived in. They came in a box with a bunch of air-filled plastic padding. What&#x27;s up with that? I would rather save the environment and have them shipped in a bag! It&#x27;s bendy and soft, why does it need padding?</li>
    <li> I just invested in a large dish drain recently.  I hesitated buying the accompanying plastic mat because the reviews were mixed.  So I bought these instead and they are PERFECT.  No water pooling, dries fast.  And then when it gets a couple of stains, throw it in the wash and put a new one out.  Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased...</li>
    <li> I bought one of these after seeing it at a friends house.  Although well made, we&#x27;re a little disappointed with its performance.  We don&#x27;t use a rack on top of the mat and just place our hand washed items on it to dry.  Key issue is that if you don&#x27;t prop things up carefully to allow ample air space, (especially cups, bowls, glasses, etc) moisture will collect in them.  Even allowing things to \\&quot;dry\\&quot; overnight, we come downstairs and find many of the items need to be wiped dry before they can be put away.  It seems with the mat&#x27;s ability to hold water, it takes a much longer time to dry out.  When we used a simple linen towel on the counter before, we didn&#x27;t have the same level of moisture on the dishes.  Maybe we just need to use a rack on top of this thing, but we expected something better.</li>
    <li> I wash dishes by hand at least 3x a day and have been using these for almost a year.  They have lasted and do a great job absorbing water.  They have also held up well in the washing machine.  I would happily buy more should I ever need to.</li>
    <li> The mats (three as a set) are smaller than 16x18. They are 15x16. I can get a 16x16 one at only $5 dollars with prime shipping. It&#x27;s just not worth the dollars!!</li>
    <li> I have one under my toaster, under my dish drainer and even in the bathroom. The uses are endless. and they work very well to absorb water. No mess.</li>
    <li> We have replaced the drying rack with these towels.  They work much better and can easily be washed and stored, which is much harder with a drying rack.  Have bought more as gifts.</li>
    <li> I use this to dry dishes and recyclables on the counter top, did not want the traditional drain board because the water would pool on the counter, this mat works well and dries quickly.  Have not run it through washer yet, holds up well when hand washed.</li>
    <li> My wife ordered a set of these to replace the ugly drying rack we had. These are terrific! The look much better, are easy to clean, and do the job well. i bought a set for a friend as a gift.</li>
    <li> These mats last a long time before they need to be washed. They don&#x27;t emit nasty odors (unless you put your face right up to them, maybe).</li>
