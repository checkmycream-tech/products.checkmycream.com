      <li>Ok so this lotion is great.</li>

      <li>The tanning lotion is amazing.</li>
      <li>And it smells amazing</li>
      <li>Just make sure you rub it in really good, it has bronzing beads that streak when u apply it</li>
      <li>Love this lotion and smells good to</li>
      <li>It needs to be applied thoroughly and in good light or</li>
      <li>I am just using this as more of a mouisterizer now and for the nice scent it leaves (even after tanning).</li>
      <li>Great price and fast shipping:)</li>
      <li>ALL IN ALL ITS A TOTAL WIN FOR THE PRICE!!!</li>
      <li>very watery.the smell was not that great</li>
      <li>I love this tanning lotion.</li>
      <li>Try it you&#x27;ll love it too.</li>
      <li>I love that when the beads bust on my skin that the bronzer is brown, not orangy at all.</li>
      <li>i will be purchasing more n more before summer rolls around :)</li>
      <li>I love the smell.</li>
      <li>When first applying it, it smells reeeeally freakin&#x27; good.</li>
      <li>At first she liked it so</li>
      <li>The 2014 Black Cherry Crush 50X Bronzer Tanning Lotion for indoor tanning beds smells absolutely wonderful !!!!</li>
      <li>😫&lt;br /&gt;Basically, if you&#x27;re looking for a good lotion that gives you GOOD color hands down</li>
      <li>But when my girlfriend (who purchased this for $35 at our salon) insisted i would like this product, AMAZON had it extremly cheap.</li>
      <li>And as I work at a tanning salon she gets to tan for free.</li>
      <li>Not only am I getting a great tan</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t see much of a color difference but already have a pretty good tan.</li>
      <li>The original bottle I ordered was stollen before it reached me and the company sent me another one at no additional cost.</li>
      <li>It leaves no burnt tanning aftersmell but instead a light sweet sent.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;d have enough light and could get it rubbed in good</li>
      <li>(I normally use Ed hardy tingle lotions, Bodicare brand, Knock Out and snooki lotions and this lotion for sure stands right up there with the well known brands! )</li>
      <li>I like things that give quick results and this just didn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s more amazing than the other lotions I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>But if not, apply carefully and thoroughly and you will be rewarded with a GORGEOUS glow.</li>
      <li>This is the first product that I have tried by Fiesta Sun, and after using their product, I am ready and willing to order some more of their tanning lotions.</li>
      <li>So satisfied I will definitely be buying another bottle.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m also getting soft smooth skin.</li>
      <li>This product was exactly how it is described.</li>
      <li>I got this at my local tanning salon for free with a special they had going on, I&#x27;ve used it once so far</li>
      <li>They were very helpful and polite.</li>
      <li>It goes on a little thinner than a solid type cream but still a good consistancy.</li>
      <li>Like the lotion actually has cute lil beads that go booms and smear extra bronze when you apply it!!</li>
      <li>Not thick like a lotion</li>
      <li>but this one is more artificial (like the candy jolly rancher smell) and not that strong.</li>
      <li>I love the little color pellets than bust open when you put it on.</li>
      <li>And what female wants to smell anything less than pretty eh?</li>
      <li>It gives a pretty color not too dark or yellow/orange.</li>

    <li> I love the smell. It goes on a little thinner than a solid type cream but still a good consistancy. SMELLS AMAZING. I love the little color pellets than bust open when you put it on. I didn&#x27;t see much of a color difference but already have a pretty good tan. I am just using this as more of a mouisterizer now and for the nice scent it leaves (even after tanning). I won&#x27;t buy it again but still don&#x27;t feel like I wasted my money either. I also only used it 2 times in the bed on back to back days. I like things that give quick results and this just didn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
    <li> I got this at my local tanning salon for free with a special they had going on, I&#x27;ve used it once so far and it gives amazing color!  I already had a good base tan so I don&#x27;t know how it would look on someone who hasn&#x27;t tanned in a while. I love that when the beads bust on my skin that the bronzer is brown, not orangy at all. I applied this to my face in the bathroom at salon before laying in the bed so I&#x27;d have enough light and could get it rubbed in good, I noticed a big dif as soon as I was applying it! This is a great lotion to use even if your just going out to run errands and want your skin to have a beautiful tan color. I think it smells great and would reccomend to anyone. After using it in an Open Sun bed for 12 mins I&#x27;m the darkest I&#x27;ve ever been and won&#x27;t need to go back for a while! (I normally use Ed hardy tingle lotions, Bodicare brand, Knock Out and snooki lotions and this lotion for sure stands right up there with the well known brands! )</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful!! I got very good results with this lotion. Definitely a keeper in my stock pile. You have instant results after using it. Just make sure you rub it in really good, it has bronzing beads that streak when u apply it but they do not streak up your tan. Over all a very good lotion!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in tanning heaven. I have a big problem with my legs getting dark like the rest of my body. And this does it. So satisfied I will definitely be buying another bottle. And it smells amazing it&#x27;s more amazing than the other lotions I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> The tanning lotion is amazing. Sometimes I just use it as regular lotion as well. The bronzer in it is great &amp; doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes.</li>
    <li> I love this tanning lotion. Not only am I getting a great tan but I&#x27;m also getting soft smooth skin. It smells great and leaves your skin feeling silky. Try it you&#x27;ll love it too.</li>
    <li> I have been tanning for almost a month now,to start for a good summer tan. I usually only use designer tanning lotions. But when my girlfriend (who purchased this for $35 at our salon) insisted i would like this product, AMAZON had it extremly cheap. It arrived within 2-3 business days. Im one to usually burn around my back sholders and chest,but with this, i have develop a quick base tan. I have used it twice and have noticed a instant glow on my legs. It DOES have small little ball bronzers inside that need extra rubbing in. This product is NOT oily at all. I usually hate the smell of cherry but this one is more artificial (like the candy jolly rancher smell) and not that strong. It leaves no burnt tanning aftersmell but instead a light sweet sent. It gives a pretty color not too dark or yellow/orange. ALL IN ALL ITS A TOTAL WIN FOR THE PRICE!!! i will be purchasing more n more before summer rolls around :) sincerely, a happy customer !!!</li>
    <li> First to review woohoo!!!! Ok so this lotion is great. It gives instant deep glowing colour, and smells like cherry kolaid. BUT when they say bronzing beads they mean it. Like the lotion actually has cute lil beads that go booms and smear extra bronze when you apply it!! However, if your playing race the tanning bed timer at a salon, I think it would streak. It needs to be applied thoroughly and in good light or else your going to have a zillion little zebra bronze stripes. Maybe that&#x27;s a look your going for? But if not, apply carefully and thoroughly and you will be rewarded with a GORGEOUS glow.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price smells good and it does the job...</li>
    <li> The 2014 Black Cherry Crush 50X Bronzer Tanning Lotion for indoor tanning beds smells absolutely wonderful !!!! This is the first product that I have tried by Fiesta Sun, and after using their product, I am ready and willing to order some more of their tanning lotions.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this for my mom who&#x27;s 65 and was in need to get some color on her pasty white skin.  And as I work at a tanning salon she gets to tan for free. This is one of the sample lotions we just so happen to sell. At first she liked it so, I ordered her a bottle. When first applying it, it smells reeeeally freakin&#x27; good. The beads I gotta admit are rather pointless. They tend to streak the skin nomatter HOW good you apply the stuff. And the worst part of all the &amp;#34;after tanning smell&amp;#34;. Omg it&#x27;s litterally one of THEE worst smells I&#x27;ve ever smelled. And it LINGERS PEOPLE. 😫&lt;br /&gt;Basically, if you&#x27;re looking for a good lotion that gives you GOOD color hands down I&#x27;d keep looking. This one doesn&#x27;t provide good color AND it&#x27;ll make you smell like burnt skin and garbage. And what female wants to smell anything less than pretty eh?</li>
    <li> Perfect !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. LOVE IT! Great delivery time.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion and smells good to</li>
    <li> works great and smells great!!!! Great price and fast shipping:) WARNING. DO NOT USE THIS LOTION UNTIL U HAVE A BASE TAN, IT MAY STREAK U.</li>
    <li> Gave me no color at all. Would not buy again. Not thick like a lotion very watery.the smell was not that great</li>
    <li> I doesn&#x27;t work. Waste of money!</li>
    <li> This product was exactly how it is described. The original bottle I ordered was stollen before it reached me and the company sent me another one at no additional cost. They were very helpful and polite. I would deffinalty recommend this product for anyone! It smells just like cherries and doesn&#x27;t have a weird smell after tanning with it! I would give this product and company a 10!</li>
