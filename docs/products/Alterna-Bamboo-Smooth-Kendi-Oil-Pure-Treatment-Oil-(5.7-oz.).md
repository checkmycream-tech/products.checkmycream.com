      <li>I&#x27;ve used this for years since I first tried a sample at Sephora.</li>

      <li>My hair was pretty enough.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s OK but not worth the money, especially for natural hair style.</li>
      <li>I live in Colorado and have fine, dry, curly hair which i blow dry and straighten.</li>
      <li>On Amazon it&#x27;s just a few dollars more for just over double the product.</li>
      <li>love this stuff it is applied on wet hair then dried.</li>
      <li>I use the old smaller one as my travel kendi oil!</li>
      <li>Works very well just after shampooing to smooth and shine my very thick, somewhat dry, colored hair.  </li>

    <li> Replenished with this larger product to refill the smaller applicator.  Saves quite a lot of $s.  Able to take the smaller one on vacation as lasts quite a long time.  Only needs a small bubble for short hair.  Would recomment to anyone with coarse, dry, frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> My sis got this for me saying, &amp;#34;Your hair isn&#x27;t pretty enough. Put this on it,&amp;#34; and then BAM! My hair was pretty enough. Getting it with the pump and this size is way better than the smaller size. I use the old smaller one as my travel kendi oil!</li>

    <li> Works super on my dry hair. Makes it so smooth</li>
    <li> I have bought this oil treatment before at Sephora, but this large salon size is a better deal for the money.  Works like a charm--helps smooth hair and remove frizz, as well as prevent damage during heat styling.  I use it on my hair every time after washing it.  Has a soft pleasant smell and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue if you apply sparingly--would highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> I put the oil on my hair and found that it was absorbed very fast. I guess it is good. But after air blow drying, my hair become too frizz...</li>
    <li> I have used this oil for years now. Usually I would have to purchase at the salon or at Ulta. On Amazon it&#x27;s just a few dollars more for just over double the product. The oil is great for smoothing your ends and adding shine to your hair.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this oil. I have really think long hair and this larger size with the pump is amazing! Two pumps and my hair is silky smooth.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK but not worth the money, especially for natural hair style. This product did not make my hair any smoother.</li>
