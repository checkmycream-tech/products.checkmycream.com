      <li>The cap is nice but tore on the third ocassion that I wore it.  </li>
      <li>I pull my hair back into a ponytail - so this product was very easy to use.  </li>

      <li>This unfortunately is not going to help me.</li>
      <li>And this product really really really works!</li>
      <li>The cap does exactly what it say it will do.</li>
      <li>I needed something to help me maintain my hairstyle while working out and for hot yoga.  </li>
      <li>and I like this product so much that I have yet to even try Save Your Do!</li>
      <li>Very helpful during work-outs at the gym!</li>
      <li>This cap is just okay, the fit and ponytail holder is a little iffy.</li>
      <li>At first I really didn&#x27;t think this would help.</li>
      <li>but my hair was dry, I love this thing.</li>
      <li>This cap keeps my hair and ponytail dry on top</li>
      <li>I really wanted to buy the &amp;#34;Save your Doo&amp;#34; wrap, but 25 bucks seemed pretty high for a sweat band.  </li>
      <li>so I need something that really works.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>this product is reasonable here...</li>
      <li>IUt really works at keeping the sweat from messing up your hair .</li>
      <li>This really worked.</li>
      <li>This works VERY WELL - a friend of mine posted about it on facebook.</li>
      <li>I bought this and got it on oct 28, I was looking for the \\&quot;save your do\\&quot; but that was just too much</li>
      <li>but it really works.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery.</li>
      <li>still recommend anyone that wants to do high intensity workouts get this product.</li>
      <li>Towards the back gets a little curly, but luckily that section can be easily covered up with more hair when I put it down.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m ordering a few more tonight.</li>
      <li>Product not worth buying not even for free.</li>
      <li>For the price I thought it wouldn&#x27;t work since I was comparing it to a celebrity who has the same type of product out but for a much higher price.</li>
      <li>, it worked, it actually worked very well!</li>
      <li>This thing is amazing, my hair is DRY when I&#x27;m done with an hour of hot (and I mean 105 degrees) yoga.</li>

      <li>I am a natural girl</li>
      <li>I wrap it very tightly and secure it with a bunch of pins</li>
      <li>so my hair has 3 different textures, my hair is natural and I haven&#x27;t had a relaxer in 10yrs</li>
      <li>Thanks to my friend who uses the other product that cost, $35.  </li>
      <li>lays the edges down very well</li>

<li> lays the edges down very well</li>
<li> my straight bob was a curly wet mess.</li>
<li> This product kept sliding off my head and it doesn&#x27;t stay in place long enough.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve never went 2wks without flat ironing my hair when I workout.  </li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t flat iron my hair since I got it done on nov 1!</li>
<li> the front of this band was soaked and I could feel the net was wet as well.  </li>
<li> The pony tail hole is low so depending on how long your hair is, it may get wet on your nape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> The center of my head is my problem area when sweating and the breathability definitely helps keep my hair dry.</li>
<li> My hair was still very wet especially around the edges</li>
<li> this doesnt keep your hair dry at all.</li>
<li> Nope, it did nothing to keep my hair dry.</li>
<li> it does keep your head dry.</li>
<li> The band around the edge holds back the sweat from dripping down my face.</li>
<li> and my hair was dry after working out!</li>
<li> the lower parameters (neckline, hairline) may be damp and moist, but my hair that is rapped underneath is ENTIRELY DRY!</li>
<li> Expected bone dry hair........</li>
<li> I have the other hair product that&#x27;s supposed keep your hair dry.</li>
<li> but when i finished my zumba workout my hair was wet.</li>
<li> and my hair was still wet in the roots.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t work, hair soaken wet.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not impressed at all.  It is just a net cap and that&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> I wear this to the gym when i workout on a regular basis.  It serves its purpose while looking somewhat stylish.</li>
    <li> It works!  I&#x27;m an african american sister who works out a lot.  I sweat in my head with sweat dripping down my face.  After I purchased this cap I no longer have this problem.  The cap stays on my head, fits comfortably and most of all absobs the sweat.  I recommend this pproduct.</li>
    <li> IUt really works at keeping the sweat from messing up your hair . That is if you can keep it on you head. I use it when working out once I have just gotten my hair done</li>
    <li> LOVE best sweat band on the market.</li>
    <li> I work out four times a week and was looking for a cap that holds my hair in place and I found it.  This cap keeps my hair and ponytail dry on top but I get a little sweaty around the edges. The band around the edge holds back the sweat from dripping down my face. Try it, for the price, why not??</li>
    <li> This cap is just okay, the fit and ponytail holder is a little iffy. I get that everyone&#x27;s head shape is different but I&#x27;m not blown away so far.</li>
    <li> Hairline was well protected but center was still wet. I would stick to the headbands. Those are great</li>
    <li> I am a African-American woman with bob cut hairstyle with my natural hair.  I needed something to help me maintain my hairstyle while working out and for hot yoga.  By the end of my class the front of this band was soaked and I could feel the net was wet as well.  I waited for about a hour before I took it off and my hair was still wet in the roots.  In the end my straight bob was a curly wet mess.</li>
    <li> Great item, bought one for my daughter and myself.  Unfortunately did not realize that they sell this product for a fraction of the price at Walmart!  Too cheap to return, so I might have to eat the cost of this one.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected but i still use it</li>
    <li> As far as keeping the sweat off my face and holding its own this is the right product to try!</li>
    <li> I was really hoping for this product to work, but not impressed at all. Its comfortable and all but when i finished my zumba workout my hair was wet. I dont have a lot of hair, not even enough for a pony tail, this is why i believed it was going to work. Nope, it did nothing to keep my hair dry. I do look cut with it on, but i didnt purchase it to look cute. Am not kicking myself for the purchase, becuase it was so cheap.</li>
    <li> I bought this and got it on oct 28, I was looking for the \\&quot;save your do\\&quot; but that was just too much so I went with this.  On nov 1 I got my hair done and didn&#x27;t touch it for the weekend.  On nov 4 I went to the gym and my workout was light so I wanted to wait until it was 2wks to really give a good review.  I workout Monday-Friday for 1hr 30min from light to really intense. And this product really really really works! I haven&#x27;t flat iron my hair since I got it done on nov 1! I&#x27;ve never went 2wks without flat ironing my hair when I workout.  After I workout I leave the cap for like 5 min, I don&#x27;t take it off immediately.  Every other day I put oil on my hair, comb and go.  Oh I&#x27;m African American, mixed with Jamaican and Guyanese so my hair has 3 different textures, my hair is natural and I haven&#x27;t had a relaxer in 10yrs so I need something that really works.  If you workout a little or a lot and you want to protect your hair get this!</li>
    <li> it works! lays the edges down very well</li>
    <li> I bought the &amp;#34;Save your Do&amp;#34; full head wrap for 29.00 and the product didnt work at all, so I tried the Dri Sweat band and to my amazement, it worked, it actually worked very well! I highly recommend it!!!!!</li>
    <li> I sweat a lot while working out and it keeps all sweat from getting in my eyes. I hate it when the sweat burns my eyes!</li>
    <li> I guess I should have payed closer attention. This cap is ridiculous, I may wear it for a night run but I&#x27;m not wearing a doo rag to the gym. I was looking for something to keep the sweat out of my eyes and off my face because let&#x27;s face it nothing is going to keep me from sweating my hair out. This unfortunately is not going to help me. The seller is great, I received my package on time, packaging was very nice, just a crappy item.</li>
    <li> The cap does exactly what it say it will do. I was a bit skeptical when I purchased it; but it really does keep your hair dry.</li>
    <li> This is great for working out without wrecking your hair.  No more fuzzy edges and poufy hair after my workouts.</li>
    <li> Expected bone dry hair........its more damp.  The pony tail hole is low so depending on how long your hair is, it may get wet on your nape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product holds an impressive amount of sweat though, less face towelling during work outs.</li>
    <li> this product is reasonable here...but i think they sell it at walmart for a little cheaper...however it really doesnt work that great. It prevents sweat for you head for running down your face but your head/edges still sweat and are still wet.</li>
    <li> I wrap my hair, put on the cap and then nike drifit hat. My hair looks perfect once it dries. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Did not like it. It slips off my head.</li>
    <li> Not thrilled with the cap. It did not work as well as I expected.</li>
    <li> Although the concept is nice, it didn&#x27;t work too well for me. My hair was still very wet especially around the edges</li>
    <li> I love working out and my hair was dry after working out!</li>
    <li> This really worked. I was leery at first because its so cheap and never heard of it before but it really works. I do zumba fitness core so I sweat a lot but my hair was dry, I love this thing. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I thought that it was a headband and not a full cap, but that was my fault...</li>
    <li> I actually started out using the head band and ended up ordering three of these. I am a natural girl so when I workout I need something to keep my hair in place. This does the trick</li>
    <li> I really wanted to buy the &amp;#34;Save your Doo&amp;#34; wrap, but 25 bucks seemed pretty high for a sweat band.  This thing is amazing, my hair is DRY when I&#x27;m done with an hour of hot (and I mean 105 degrees) yoga.</li>
    <li> Very helpful during work-outs at the gym!</li>
    <li> Wow, all I can say is it&#x27;s easy to slip on and gets my hair out of my face when I workout!  Thanks to my friend who uses the other product that cost, $35.  This one needs no special skill.  Love, love, love it.</li>
    <li> This works VERY WELL - a friend of mine posted about it on facebook. She indicated it is sold at Target, but I was *never* able to find it in stock at any local stores. I ordered it from this site and it was shipped quickly. It really will keep your hair dry during even an intense workout. I sweat a lot in my scalp (unfortunately) - the lower parameters (neckline, hairline) may be damp and moist, but my hair that is rapped underneath is ENTIRELY DRY!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Unhappy with item it didnt fit my head it had a hole so u could put ur pontail thru maybe if I was a toddler. Product not worth buying not even for free.</li>
    <li> For the price I thought it wouldn&#x27;t work since I was comparing it to a celebrity who has the same type of product out but for a much higher price. The cap was easy to put on, no tightness or squeezing around my temples. My test to see how good this would work was by doing the Insanity workout.  Folks let me tell ya! It did the job! I left it on my head for approximately 30 minutes so I could cool down and not sweating and it worked perfect! I was and still am amazed about how effective this product is and wished I had it all my life. I have relaxed hair with no weave just below my shoulders. I strongly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> At first I really didn&#x27;t think this would help. But it absolutely proved me wrong. I have the other hair product that&#x27;s supposed keep your hair dry. However, I recommend this one!</li>
    <li> I have short hair and this product was not a good choice for me.  I thought it was more of a wrap than a ponytail holder.</li>
    <li> Love it, it met my expectations!</li>
    <li> Not worth the money; ineffective</li>
    <li> Like most of the reviews, I also looked into &amp;#34;Save Your Do&amp;#34;. In fact, I bought this product the same time as Save Your Do and I like this product so much that I have yet to even try Save Your Do! For women that want to work out and don&#x27;t want to ruin their hair, this product is a lifesaver! I&#x27;ve been doing Shaun T&#x27;s Focus T-25 (the Insanity guy) and anyone that&#x27;s familiar with the workout knows you are going to sweat, and sweat, and sweat!!! I&#x27;m African-American with shoulder-length hair. I wrap it very tightly and secure it with a bunch of pins and then I leave it on for about a half hour or so after the workout and then take it off.&lt;br /&gt;Anyone that expects to be 100% dry is rather unrealistic. The center of my head is my problem area when sweating and the breathability definitely helps keep my hair dry. Towards the back gets a little curly, but luckily that section can be easily covered up with more hair when I put it down. I do however suspect that this may be causing hair thinning on my edges. Gasp!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still recommend anyone that wants to do high intensity workouts get this product. I&#x27;m interested to see how it works for people that do long distance running.</li>
    <li> The cap is nice but tore on the third ocassion that I wore it.  I would still order it again however, because I train alot and also like something covering my head when I sleep.</li>
    <li> Head still wet in middle not good</li>
    <li> Worked really well, I was impressed.  Pulled my hair back in a pony tail and then put on the headband.  I didn&#x27;t have any sweat running down my face, no sweat in my eyes, and it actually absorbed the sweat from all around my hairline.  I will probably buy another one so I can wash one and have a spare.</li>
    <li> Cap stays in place and allows air to reach your hair since the top is mesh.  I recommend this to others who workout.</li>
    <li> it works very well and great for working out. it does keep your head dry. so buy the product. .</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it says.  I&#x27;m enjoying my workout with it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jo Gilmore</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t work, hair soaken wet.  Die from cap mixed in with my sweat.  Could not understand why my white towel was turning blue.</li>
    <li> bahaha this doesnt keep your hair dry at all. just a headband. save your money.</li>
    <li> At first I was skeptical about this cap but after a vigorous workout this evening I&#x27;m a believer!  I wear my thick unprocessed AA hair in a flat iron style.  When it&#x27;s time to workout I pull my hair back into a ponytail - so this product was very easy to use.  I just pulled it on and popped my pony tail through the convenient opening in the back and let the sweating begin!  I&#x27;m ordering a few more tonight.</li>
    <li> This product kept sliding off my head and it doesn&#x27;t stay in place long enough.</li>
    <li> Absorbs the sweat, but hair still gets very wet.</li>
</ol>
