<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I live in the dry Los Angeles area but I&#x27;m from Michigan... My hair is naturally curly but once away from moisture, it is flat and limp. Using this with the combination of OGX weightless hydration shampoo and OGX quenched ocean conditioner, my hair constantly stays curly! It can get a tiny bit crunchy if you apply too much, but I have tried countless products with no luck. This stuff helps keep the water in my hair after a shower and days after!</li>
    <li> Bottle was shipped in a large box without bubble wrap, thus not secure in box. The bottle was not tightly closed and a lot of the product spilled into the box. The product itself was not worth the price and, at best, works as well as any generic store brand.</li>
    <li> OH MY GOODNESS! Where was this 4 years ago when I decided to say screw it with my curly hair and straighten it for 4 years which then resulted in split ends like you wouldn&#x27;t believe and pissed off hair?! This stuff is seriously HG status! I only have to put in a leave in conditioner (and that&#x27;s more by choice) and then put this stuff in and my curls look like I took a curling iron to them! Ugh, I&#x27;m so in love! I can finally wash and go! Thank God! I will definitely be purchasing the liter size and highly recommend it to anyone with curly hair, or even wavy hair! Just do it!</li>
    <li> When you apply it to your wet hair, it doesn&#x27;t feel like the product will do anything more than just water would do but when it dries you can absolutely tell the difference it makes.  Curls stick together vs. being stringy and it smooths out alot of the frizz so it looks and feels very soft vs. crunchy.</li>
    <li> I bought this product hopeing it did what it said control frizzy hair....it did nothing! It has the consistency of water and made my curly hair hard..dry and even more frizzy than before.This was definitely a waste of money and I would not recommend it at all!</li>
    <li> WOW... I just got this yesterday. I was having an extremely unruly hair day . I put some curl keeper on my dry hair , and it made it instantly soft, and so shiny. I added some water to hair and more shine and bounce. This stuff smells delicious.&lt;br /&gt;I know I will be a long term user . Am not sure why it works so good, but my hair loves it.</li>
    <li> Best I&#x27;ve used for my curly hair!!</li>
    <li> Now that I have used this, it is a must have for my fine, curly hair. I use it in combination with AG Recoil curling creme. It keeps my hair from becoming a frizzy, flyaway mess. I&#x27;m very happy to have stumped across this. It lasts a long time, so it&#x27;s worth the cost. I have medium length hair (about three inches below shoulder length) and it lasted three months with daily use.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for me. Expensive mistake.</li>
    <li> It works great, but you do have to use a lot of the product</li>
    <li> I have curly hair that&#x27;s beautiful when the weather is ideal, zero humidity....rarely happens here in kansas.  I&#x27;ve struggled my entire life trying to find a solution to keeping my curls together and not frizzy.  I&#x27;ve probably spent thousands on hair care trying to find this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used this I didn&#x27;t use enough and after re-watching the youtube video on how to use this....the second time is much better!  I LOVE my hair!  Which, if you have curly hair you know that you can&#x27;t say that every day as it just does what it wants to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust me, watch the youtube video that Veronica Meza made and do what she says!  It will seem like you are using way too much but it doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down, nor make it crunchy.  Just follow Veronica&#x27;s lead.  After you dry your hair, scrunch out the crunchy and it will be beautiful....bouncy, light and shiny!</li>
    <li> Not what I expected the smell is horrible smells old and leaves my hair crunchy and hard!!!</li>
    <li> If you scrunch it after it dries, the wet look goes away and you&#x27;re left with soft waves. Works great.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many products for curly hair and they always left my hair hard or sticky . Curl keeper is amazing my curl is soft and frizz free all day. And the next day I can wet it and the curl comes right back . This product is water base and there is no build up. Love this and would tell everyone with curly hair to use it.</li>
    <li> I think I was expecting a lot given all of the possitive reviews, but I was really disappointed in this product.  My first complaint was the smell.  It smells like my grandmother&#x27;s lipstick (I don&#x27;t know how else to describe it) - kind of a weird waxy/plastic-y smell.  It also left my hair very crunchy.  And even beyond the crunch (lots of products for curly hair leave my hair crunchy) it left my hair anything but soft, almost like it was drying out my hair.  I would not recomend this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, I&#x27;ve given this product a second chance.  The first time I used it by itself - this time I used it under gel which made a big difference.  The gel helped with the smell and Curl Keeper seemed to enhance the performance of my gel.  While my hair is still anything but soft (I think anyone with frizz-prone hair knows better than to touch their hair anyway) I did get good separation of curls and frizz control.  Now I&#x27;d give it 3 1/2, maybe 4 stars.  I think I can get more consistent good-hair-days with this stuff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m mixed, Indian &amp; Black with fine curly hair. This product works really well at minimizing frizz, and adding a shiny non-greasy look without weighing hair down. I will definitely buy it again, it is one of the best frizz reducers I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot. Definitely worth the price!!</li>
    <li> In a desperate attempt to find a combo that works as well as Graham Webb Curl Defining Gel, I purchased this and some DevaCurl Gel. It&#x27;s alright. I used it today -- I&#x27;m not having an awful hair day, it&#x27;s decent but I&#x27;ve had far better hair days with other products. Try to FX Curl Booster Fixative gel instead. It&#x27;s way cheaper and works far better.</li>
    <li> I went to naturallycurly.com and saw great reviews for this product for people with 3a or 3b hair. It does dry crisp but if you just barely scrunch it then the crisp goes away and I just have almost perfect curls. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Curl Keeper is a great product for very curly hair that does what it is supposed to do....separates and defines curls and pretty much eliminates frizz.  My reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that if you use as directed, your hair is very wet.  Therefore, it takes a long time to dry naturally or you must use a diffuser.  It also works well for second day hair.  When  applied over damp hair or mixed with a little water over your curls, it revitalizes hair to almost the same look as day 1 hair. Also, there is no product build up when applied repeatedly.  I can definitely recommend this product for those with lots of curls that need to be tamed.[[ASIN:B003USIHZY Curly Hair Solutions Curl Keeper, 8.0 fl. oz.]</li>
    <li> I have to admit, this is really good stuff. At first, I thought it smelled kind of cheap, but it&#x27;s really an amazing product. Not sure if it&#x27;s worth the price, but I will see if there&#x27;s a place to get it cheaper. I think that they need to work on the smell...</li>
    <li> I am so glad I listened to the reviews and purchased this product.  I used to hate my hair curly until I tried this product.  Absolutely AMAZING!</li>
    <li> I love this serum. It goes on easily and when my hair dries it isn&#x27;t sticky at all. If my curls are slightly stiff after drying I just gently rub my fingers through them and it transforms my hair into soft curls that are pretty to look at.</li>
    <li> I have long wavy hair that frizzes up like crazy!  I use Curl Keeper on dry hair - add a quarter sized dollup in my palm, rub my hands together and between my fingers and lightly apply ends to roots.  Seriously tames the frizz and keeps my curls moist but not wet looking.  Smells nice too- doesnt interfere with any frangrances.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this product in a subscription box last year and was hesitant to try it due to the very watery consistency. However, once I took it for a test run I was hooked! It perfectly holds my naturally wavy hair and adds extra spring when I scrunch my hair. It&#x27;s never sticky and I can reanimate my hair with a little spritz of water. I have used gels and sprays to get the perfect curly hair, but this product is my new go-to!</li>
    <li> You have to learn how much to use for your hair type. My hair is soft and with water it bounces right back. Love this find.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I have 3b curly hair and use this with a little AG Re:coil or MOP C system C curl. Diffuse dry and I&#x27;m done. Obviously I&#x27;m not following what the directions are but I get great results and can get it wet again the next day and just diffuse and I&#x27;m done for great second day hair. Definitely try it out!</li>
    <li> I specifically bought this product to use on a trip to Bermuda.  It held my curls in place and I rocked the curly (frizz free) look.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t have enough hold, but I like that it does encourage curl, and it&#x27;s not crunchy when dry.</li>
    <li> Works just as promised.  I love it!!!!</li>
    <li> The product was amazing on my curly hair. It eliminated the frizz and left it soft. I would totally buy it again when i finish it.</li>
    <li> I love this product so much ! It really defines my curls and its water based so it doesn&#x27;t weigh my curls down and It&#x27;s great for everyday use. I have recommended this product to all my curly haired girls.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing I have ever used. I got a generous-sized sample, used it for a week first, then I couldn&#x27;t live without it. It&#x27;s water based; not heavy at all.  It doesn&#x27;t tell you this, but it also works if you decide to wear your hair straight.  I have fine, curly hair. This past L.A. summer has been humid beyond what we are used to, and I was desperate to not look like Albert Einstein for one more day!!!  You just comb it through and let your hair dry, or  clip it back and blow out the front sections (like I do).  Polished ringlets that aren&#x27;t full of dimethicone or silicone -based product (those can work, BUT one drop too much can be disastrous).  Buh-bye, frizz!</li>
    <li> Best product I have found for curly hair! It keeps your curls tight without getting frizzy, but doesn&#x27;t give the look of product being in your hair.</li>
    <li> I have 2c/3b hair...I scrunch this in while my hair is soaking wet after the shower.  I follow it up with a gel directly after and then rescrunch with flour sack cloths.  This product makes my hair feel soft and clean - so many of the curly girl approved products make my hair feel coated in a film.  This cuts the frizz and still feels clean and bouncy.  Love it!</li>
    <li> First I want to get into the cons of this product and then get into my rave review. There are only 2 bad things about this product, one is that the marketing for it is terrible. I&#x27;ve been searching for curling products for my hair for years, almost obsessively... everything from foams, gels, creams, and sprays to wands, irons, and every curler or hot roller imaginable and never in all my searching did I hear a word about this product. I only came across it by accident online while looking for something else. The second bad things is the price. This isn&#x27;t Redkin or CHI or any high end hair product, it&#x27;s some brand that most people have never heard anything about (back to that lousy marketing thing) yet they charge an insane amount for it. For around 20 bucks you get 8 ounces, which is less product than you get with any normal bottle of Shampoo... a lot less. If you want the large bottle that comes with a pump, you&#x27;re paying around 50 bucks. That is absolutely insane. INSANE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now on to the pros. I have what I call naturally confused hair. Some days it&#x27;s curly, sometimes it&#x27;s straight and poofy, and other days I have big weird looking waves. It&#x27;s very fine and thin and I normally have a hard time styling it in any way. I love the look of curls though and as I said before, I had been searching for years (online and in stores) for a product to help me easily create curls. This product is not only great for getting rid of frizz if you&#x27;re a curly haired girl but it CREATES curls if you aren&#x27;t. A lot of people said this stuff works best if applied to a soaking wet head. For me, it is best on a slightly damp head. I either let my hair mostly air dry or I spray with a spray bottle and then I put a crap ton of this stuff in my hair and scrunch. Ounce I&#x27;m happy with it, I leave it alone, doing my best not to touch it until it&#x27;s dry. Once it&#x27;s dry, it feels crunchy and stiff but I scrunch it again and the stiffness turns into soft beautiful shiny, natural looking curls. Not only does this product make my hair look gorgeous and give me a head full of curls that I wouldn&#x27;t have otherwise, but it takes no time to do it... probably about 5 to 10 minutes. And water re-activates it. So if you get caught in the rain or have a beach day, you&#x27;re still left with your beautiful style. This leaves people thinking your hair is naturally that curly and gorgeous. I am literally throwing away all of my other curling or scrunching products (or giving them to friends). Curl Keeper is all that I need. (well and some water) I don&#x27;t even need a hair spray with this stuff. It&#x27;s perfect for everyday use and you can put in a spray bottle or whatever you want, which makes it super convenient for travel. As far as the product itself goes, it is perfect. It goes above and beyond any expectations. I just hate that they get away with charging so much for it. For price alone, I had to leave out a star.curls.

    <li> So far, I like this product.  I think it is designed for long-haired curly girls who wear their&lt;br /&gt;hair natural  (without blow drying).  My hair is short, though, and I do blow dry it and use&lt;br /&gt;mousse also.</li>
    <li> I am a curly hair junkie and I love testing new product for my curly hair and a friend recommended this.  I absolutely love it! And for the first time I must say that this product is true to their statement.  I have always been skeptical about not re-doing my hair daily but this Curl Keeper really works!  I have actually done my hair on a Sunday and went to work on Monday with barely touching it up and then I decided to push my limits and try a 3rd day.  To my amazement all I had to do was scrunch with some water and my curls were perfect.  I am looking at buying a larger bottle!</li>
    <li> I really like this, it gives curl definition but doesn&#x27;t feel crunchy, heavy or sticky. I&#x27;ve only used it when letting my hair dry naturally so I&#x27;m not sure how it will turn out with a blow dryer, it does have a smell but it isn&#x27;t too strong for me and I&#x27;m usually sensitive about perfumes. I&#x27;ll definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> It was ok. Didn&#x27;t work that well for my hair. Left it too crunchy feeling and frizzy still. Disappointed I spent so much on this.</li>
    <li> Great for my unruly, curly hair!</li>
    <li> Great product. Love that it&#x27;s light weight and doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering smell. I have fine curly hair and this doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. Be sure to give it a good scrunch after your hair dries to get the little bit of crunch out.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this and it made such a difference in my hair that I came straight to Amazon to stock up. I have fine thick curly hair of different consistencies that I always blow straight-ish. I haven&#x27;t tried using this as directed by air-drying or using a diffuser, but it made a HUGE difference in blowdrying my hair straight. There&#x27;s no frizz and it has the nice soft consistency that I&#x27;ve only gotten at my hairstylist&#x27;s and never at home. It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
    <li> This product just did not give me the desired results I was hoping for and I am so disappointed.  My hair is very wavy with no actual ringlets,  I have annoying combo hair that can&#x27;t figure out if its wavy or straight. My ends have a tendency to go straight.  I cannot use this alone because within an hour or two the frizzies start. I need to use it with gel or mousse and even then,  I didn&#x27;t get that miracle that I read about on the reviews.  There is  good product review on Youtube. This girl tells you step by step how to use it (it is quite a tedious process by the way) and the final results are amazing. Her perfect curly, sexy, to-die-for hair had me running to my computer in search of this miracle potion. Fellow readers, unless you have THAT TYPE OFF PERFECT CURLY HAIR JUST LIKE HERS...your hair will not come out like like. Sorry. Oh, and the smell. Not pleasant. Smells like plastic. I don&#x27;t know if anyone can smell that on me when I&#x27;m out, probably not, but it&#x27;s quite strong while applying. This little 8-ounce bottle didn&#x27;t last me long since I need so much. It&#x27;s expensive for what you get. But hey, try it once, see how it goes. It might work for your hair type.</li>
    <li> Hair feels dried out and a little crunchy.  I have a lot of hair but it&#x27;s curly porous and somewhat fine</li>
    <li> My curly hair is full of body but very fine, so it frizzes easily. Adding Curl Keeper to my product routine has made the frizz all but disappear! Hair curls well, with even better results if i let it sit before drying. Great product, will definitely purchase again! :-)</li>
    <li> I seriously love this stuff. I have super thick, coarse curly hair that gets frizzy hast. This is the only thing that can tame the beast. I use the Curly Girl method, cowash/condition, followed by leave-in conditioner, Curly Hair Solutions and hair gel. Perfect combo!!</li>
    <li> This product is horrible.  It smells bad, and it made my hair so dry.  Not to mention when the bottle came it was filthy.</li>
    <li> need a lot of of product at once, but is wonderfullllll!!!!  Great for thick, frizzy hair that is hard to maintain.  This product will not weigh it down, doesn&#x27;t make it look greasey, it just smooths the curls.</li>
    <li> Too expensive for such poor result</li>
    <li> Curl definition is great for my 4a/b type!!</li>
    <li> Try it exactly as instructed and you&#x27;ll see what I mean, for all of you naturally curly haired gals that need a little help with creating the perfect curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the larger bottle from the website.  I&#x27;ll transfer to this bottle for travel, even though you get a huge amount- enough for at least a month.  Keep in mind, I cleanse my hair about 2x a week maximum.</li>
    <li> This product works great</li>
    <li> DOESN&#x27;T work. This product does not work. But I got it on time. Be careful with what you order online.</li>
    <li> I did not like this product...it is good for people who wants to put it on the wet hair and that is it. but if you plan on blow drying it curly, it is no good, it leaves the hair oily looking and very stiff.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews and even watched a youtube video on this. After that, I had to try it. I absolutely love this for my frizzy wavy fine hair. I have never had a product that did what it was supposed to do and then some. I keeps my hair frizz free, it gives my hair body, and it holds my hair nicely all day and my hair stays soft thru all this. I love it so much that I bought another bottle so I don&#x27;t run out. If you have frizzy hair that is hard to manage, get this. You will not be disappointed. Love it!!</li>
    <li> Gives me the most defined curls!! Amazing, cant live without it anymore! Only minus point its very expencive and i have to pay a lot of shippingfees because i live in switzerlAnd and there are only US or british distributer!!!</li>
    <li> I believe it helps to keep frizz at bay...hard to tell. I will say that the smell is strange and is only bearable after you add a better-smelling gel to your hair. I&#x27;ve not noticed a big difference of whether it makes my hair less frizzy, but b/c so many other curly girls swear by this as a part of their daily routine, I&#x27;ll keep using it till it runs out (but not sure I&#x27;ll get it again).</li>
    <li> I own so many potions for curly hair. This was new to me and I do really like it!!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely my new favorite!</li>
    <li> I have been using this stuff for the better part of ten years and I love it.  The bottle has changed, but the stuff is still great.  In the summer, I hate to blow dry and straighten my hair, this is the best because I can add to wet, not damp hair and just go about my day with great hair.</li>
    <li> I use this right after I co wash my hair &amp; I use the ouidad tress effects gel right after it &amp; it really helps with my frizzy curly hair. I am happy I can buy this on Amazon because it is really expensive on frizzoff.com.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! It leaves my hair shiny and light. It controls my frizz wonderfully. I have never had anything quite like this. My hair is not stiff at all. It does take quite a bit to cover all my long and somewhat thick hair. It&#x27;s a little on the expensive side so that is why I knocked it down 1 star.</li>
    <li> I have owned this product for a few months now and  i could never go back. I have crazy curls that are almost impossible to control. Everyday, i use some leave in conditioner and this on top and it controls your frizz and keeps your curls looking exactly as they did when you style it. Its a very lightweight product, water-based, however my only complaint is that sometimes it leaves parts of my hair a tiny bit crunchy. Other than that, this product is the best thing thats ever controlled my curly hair. Since I started use, the compliments on my hair doubled!! Definitely get it you will not regret it!</li>
    <li> Wow... I had no idea that a product like this could even EXIST, let alone work... I have &amp;#34;Type 2B (Wavy Curly)&amp;#34; hair that I usually flat-iron out of fear that by mid-day, my hair will poof out like Bozo the clown. I tried this while visiting my sister in New Orleans and it actually controlled my hair! I had hair like a Brazilian supermodel for at least eight hours - even with drizzle. I highly recommend this and will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time and was well packaged. It has done wonders for my 3a/3b curly hair. I love that it helps me get second and third day curls. I actually think my second days curls look the best.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent. I use this after lots of heavy duty conditioner and my curls have never been so frizz-free and so natural looking.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a solid 2C with fine but LOTS of just below shoulder length hair.  This stuff is FANTASTIC!!!  My current routine is AG Recoil, Curl Keeper, and Bioterra (Biolage knock-off) gel with a little bit of LA Looks Blue high-humidity control gel mixed in cuz I live in High-humidity St. Louis :)  I scrunch/rake all that through and then diffuse dry on med while scrunching periodically and finishing with that final scrunch-out-the-crunch.  My hair is healthy and low porosity and I found plopping didn&#x27;t do anything (except make my curls flatter and fuzzier) and air drying takes FOREVER!!  This stuff really really works even with the diffuser!  I tried not using curl keeper but the rest of the routine for about a week and I could def tell a dif!  Curls were not as bouncy or defined and had lots &#x27;o dreaded crown &#x27;fuzz&#x27; and certainly wasn&#x27;t as shiny.  I wash about once a week with bs/acv and follow with suave naturals but I water wash every day.  No product build up issues at all.  I have bad-bad habit of running my hands through my hair when I&#x27;m thinking or distracted, and with curl keeper I keep relatively frizz free even by the end of the day.  Was NOT frizz free during the week I went without using this ;)  For my fine hair, I wouldn&#x27;t say this has a strong hold, hence why the other gels, but it does give me excellent curl definition and shine as well as frizz control without weighing hair down.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my younger sister. It was the first time she has tried it and she seems to like it. It takes a fair amount to keep her curls but if she is happy then so am I.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! Light, so it does not weigh your hair down or sticky. I put this in after conditioner.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, but don&#x27;t confuse it with gel.  This is more watery and rinses clean out of my hair without using shampoo.  It gives just enough hold to tame my frizz, but still forms beautiful curls.  I&#x27;d be lost without it!</li>
    <li> Holy grail product! Feels great in my hair and I love the smell too!</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me. I usually like to go 2 days with curly hair. The first day was okay, but day 2 was basically unmanageable. The under part of my hair was a mess. I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> This just didn&#x27;t do what I had hoped. It was slightly less disappointing than the treatment shampoo, but it didn&#x27;t provide any recoil to my curls. They seemed kind of disorganized and lackluster after use.</li>
    <li> I am a type 3a, naturally curly and frizzy girl. I have a ton of curl. I do not need anything to promote curling in my hair, it does it all by itself. My problem is controlling the volume and the frizz. I have been using this product for a month and this is my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first few days, the product did not work right, I wasn&#x27;t using enough and hadn&#x27;t learned how to apply it. After watching the video and applying enough to my hair to &amp;#34;sploosh&amp;#34;, I found I had beautifully defined curls, although they were hard and crunchy even after shaking it out when dry. Then, I began to read on the product and others experiences and I experimented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not buy a recoil or curl enhancing product to use with this simply because I don&#x27;t need any help in that area. I began applying leave-in first to try and reduce the amount of Curl Keeper I was applying. (I use MOPTOP leave-in conditioner). I applied the leave-in and then this product, still a substantial amount of both, and it gave me beautiful frizz-free curls without the crunch. However, I still felt like I was using WAY too much product. I was going to run through this bottle in 2 weeks if I didn&#x27;t work it out somehow. Also, my scalp was itching on second day and I HATE that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So..then I began experimenting with amounts. More leave-in with less curl keeper versus more curl-keeper less leave-in. I found using about equal amounts (about a quarter sized dollop of each for each side of my hair) of leave-in and curl keeper gives me the perfect amount of control without crunch and lasts well into the second day with no head itch. I had no luck getting past the second day with this stuff. I have my usual frizzy bally mess by day 3, but that is how it always is for my hair. My hair is shoulder length and I have a lot of it. I also found combing through the products in my wet hair distributed this more evenly. It can tend to goop up in one spot if you don&#x27;t comb it through. Do this very gently, don&#x27;t damage your hair while wet. I also notice my hair in general is in better shape using this combination of products. It seems less dry and more healthy even on day 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully this review helps someone else out there looking to try this product. Judging from the reviews here and on naturally curly website, the product doesn&#x27;t work for all types of hair. However, I have found it is an amazing go-to or holy grail product for my hair and it is the only product I will use (with the leave-in)., don&#x27;t damage your hair while wet.

    <li> I can&#x27;t do my hair without this. After washing, I put on my hair first and let dry some, then add the gel. Keeps my dry curls looking great. No more dryness! I&#x27;m so glad I found this.</li>
    <li> good for frizz.... will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I apply this to my hair after towel drying and end up using a lot to make it work. My hair is soft medium thickness wavy/curly hair just below my shoulders and it seems like you have to do section by section otherwise it will not make your curls look hydrated and control frizz. I have received compliments lately about how pretty my curly hair is so that is a plus. It does rinse out clean but the fragrance is something I hate to smell. I immediately wash my hands after.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after trying a sample size. Great for helping with the frizz you get with humidity. I love it.</li>
    <li> Flat freezy curly hair&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like this product, it doesn&#x27;t give Any body to my curls and makes it very flat</li>
    <li> I just ordered the huge 33oz.  I use to use this with the mixed chicks leave in with curl keeper and my curls come out amazingly. only con is it breaks me out so I had to stop using it.</li>
    <li> It does make my curls more curly, but it leaves this jelly residual that I can&#x27;t stand. It takes enormous amount of time to get the curls to be silky again.  I guess if you have lots of time to do your hair every day it might be OK, but I don&#x27;t.  Back to searching something better.</li>
    <li> This makes my curls perfect - no frizz or greasy feel and doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down.  Will definitely continue to use.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by a customer of mine. We both had similar textured hair and she said she really enjoyed it I tried it felt wonderful in my hands and in my hair. I have a mixed textured hair my dad had straight hair and my mother has a more traditional African-American textured hair. So that being said we don&#x27;t wash her hair every day usually once a week or once every two weeks do to the fact that my hair craves moisture. So I would apply this product just about every morning. When I first wash my hair and use the oil my hair would be bouncy and soft and hydrated. But the following days when I would rejuvenate my curls either with the oil alone a splash a little water and add the oil my hair would dry hard. And by hard I mean when you dump to much gel in your hair. Needless to say I am very disappointed and only use this oil when I first wash my hair and then switch to Moroccan oil or some other expensive oil. I should of known better the price was too good.</li>
    <li> Eh...I bought this after seeing a video commercial on how to use it. But I did not think it performed as advertised.</li>
    <li> Made my hair DRY and my curls stringy!!! Found my 2nd day curls so tangled and matted I actually had to use my tangle teaser on some spots. I never touch my hair with a brush of any kind when it is dry. So was not pleased at all with this product. Tried adjusting the amount and gave it a second try, sadly, got the same result. Will NOT buy again!!!</li>
    <li> This is an expensive product and it didn&#x27;t work for my hair. I would have skipped it</li>
    <li> I love this I am so glad that I found this. I have wavy thick hair that is slightly curly in some areas. I live in Florida, so the weather is not hair friendly. I had read that KY jelly has around the same ingredients and many people mention it works just like this without the big price. Well that didn&#x27;t really work well with my hair. This however help get rid a lot of my frizz. I but it on my wet hair after my Leave in and style cream. I put this all over the middle to the ends of my hair. Then I put my curly gel and I put a little more of the curl keeper on my problematic areas. And Viola frizz be gone. The next day I just put some on my hands and rubs it with some water then apply it to my problem areas. Works like a charm. You can spritz your hair with water again but for me my hair doesn&#x27;t look so hot when I do that. I only spritz my hair if I am going to apply more gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely part of my hair routine care. I just wish I found this sooner.</li>
    <li> This is great and works. I have four stars though because I don&#x27;t have time to put several different products in my hair. Some complain about the smell I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s bad at all. But for what you get it is expensive.</li>
    <li> After reading all of the reviews it seemed like this is the product I was looking for. But was let down when it made my hair look worse. It made my hair really frizzy. I have long curly/wavy hair and I used this product a few times. I used it by its self with no other product..my hair was so frizzy..I tried air drying and blow drying it with defuser ..with other products and nothing worked. It could work for you as different curly solutions do different things for people. But for me it was a waist of time and money..and it made my hair look really oily..</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have found to keep my curls from frizzy, yet defined. I love it because my curls still look defined&lt;br /&gt;the next day.</li>
    <li> When I first used Curl Keeper, I was disappointed in my results--my hair clumped together, but weighed my hair down (I have 3a-3b curls). After reading other people&#x27;s reviews about the amount of product to use, I decided to use a little less of the product and it yielded outstanding results! A little goes a long way with this product, but a little trial and error will eventually give you the most defined, soft, and glossy curls. Depending on your hair type (along with other factors like porosity, density, etc.) you may need to use another product that \\&quot;holds\\&quot; your curls together such as gel or mousse. Overall, this is one of the best products for curly hair!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty picky about what I will use in my hair on days that I wear it curly.  I received a sample of this product from a monthly beauty service and fell in love with the texture and hold.  Purchased on Amazon since the price is much cheaper and I am a Prime member.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feels like water going into the hair; doesn&#x27;t leave build up or cause &#x27;crunchy&#x27; hair.  Soft, natural looking hold with shine.  I even recommended to my hair stylist that she begin to carry this product.</li>
    <li> This product claims to &amp;#34;re-activate&amp;#34; when it comes in contact with water and that your style will last for days.  Not true with my hair.  I have very curly and bouncy hair that falls in natural ringlets that are about an inch in diameter.  My hair is not normally frizzy, but when I use this product my hair is limp and sort of &#x27;fuzzes out&#x27;.  I get SUCH better results with my trusty old Tresemme flawless curls mousse!  I&#x27;ve even been using Curl Keeper in conjunction with other recommended products from the manufacturer with no success.  I guess the lesson to learn is that there is no such thing as a product that will work for EVERY person with curly hair.  I won&#x27;t be buying it again, and the only reason I&#x27;ll finish using up the bottle I have is because it cost way too much money to just throw in the trash.</li>
    <li> I liked this gel but it was really, really runny. It seemed to go very quickly because of that. But it did make my curls more pronounced.</li>
    <li> defrizzes and enhances curl without making my hair stiff and/or greasy. it also has the nice quality that it is reactivated with water, so it works nicely the next day too. it&#x27;s also not hard to wash out like mouse can be. it does smell terrible.. not sure what that is all about, but it&#x27;s manageable.</li>
    <li> I seen this product used on YouTube and when I fianlly used it I was satisfied. I use mousse as my main product but this product made my curls look very defined and curlier than with mousse.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite products. I have yet to try it alone with just a leave in. Personally, I always pair it with KCCC and so far that&#x27;s done wonders. I only use it on days I must look nice because its so runny and expensive and I cant afford to buy it a lot. These are the days my hair looks its best. The curls have virtually no frizz, clump well and are so shiny! Now maybe that has to do with pairing it with KCCC, my other favorite, but one thing I know is one of these products is doing the job right.&lt;br /&gt;I have very porous, dry frizzy hair. It looks more 80&#x27;s frizz than it does curly. The only time that&#x27;s not true and I have beautiful curls is when I use this product.&lt;br /&gt;My ONLY complaint would be how runny it is. It kind of spills through my hands when trying to apply it.</li>
    <li> VERY DISAPPOINTED TO SAY THE LEAST. I SO WANTED THIS PRODUCT TO WORK FOR MY DAUGHTERS THICK CURLY HAIR! WE FOLLOWED DIRECTIONS AND SHE STILL HAS FRIZZ. I WISH IT HAD A MONEY BACK GUARANTEE!! THAT IS ALOT OF MONEY TO THROW AWAY</li>
    <li> It does a good job of smoothing out the frizz of my hair, although it does leave it feeling a little sticky. I use this product to go along with my &amp;#34;Curly Girl&amp;#34; method for caring for my curly hair.</li>
    <li> I tried this in my birchbox and loved it, but after using it a few more times it does leave my hair a little bit brittle. However, unlike other products if you touch your hair and work your fingers through it once it dries, it doesn&#x27;t leave a gross residue. Might have been a bit much for what my hair needed, but still a good product. It is rather watery so it squirts right out, just be careful with the amount and you will be fine!</li>
    <li> Clean, natural looking!  Curl Keeper is easy to style.</li>
    <li> This is officially my go-to hair product.  I was never been able to find a product that would work well with my fine, curly hair, so I ended up straightening my hair every day for about 15 years.  One day I just decided I needed to stop with all the heat on my hair and decided to give my natural curls a try.  I was skeptical, but this stuff is great!  It really defines my curls and doesn&#x27;t give me much frizz.  And the best part...  it leaves my hair soft and not crunchy.  I&#x27;ve also recommended this to friends who have fallen in love with it too!</li>
    <li> Absolutely the most perfect curly hair product EVER. I will never use anything else. Fights frizz and defines curls while being lightweight and non-greasy.  If you are looking for &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; curls make sure to scrunch the crunchy texture out after the curls have had time to set. You only need a small amount of product for maximum effect.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work well for me</li>
    <li> I liked using curl keeper, but for my hairs texture  which is a 3b/3c (naturallycurly.com), and length, which is about medium, I had to use nearly a fourth of the bottle each wash day. I can&#x27;t find this product in my area, and it would be pricey for me to keep repurchasing from amazon. I also felt it didn&#x27;t have much of a hold at all. I hoped it would last longer in my hair. Overall, I enjoyed the product,  but I hate that I have to use so much.</li>
    <li> I have veryyy long, naturally curly, thick hair and this stuff doesn&#x27;t do much for me unless I add another product (gel) with it. It has a horrible smell that I can&#x27;t get over! Watched some tutorials on YouTube on how to use this stuff and it seems like you have to use a lot to make it work, even though it still didn&#x27;t work for my hair. Not worth the money and won&#x27;t be buying again</li>
    <li> I love this product! Great for curly hair. And, the great thing is later in the day after applying this product in the am, you can just wet your hands and reactivate the product again for a great look!</li>
    <li> This is the only product I have ever found that really works on my curly hair!  I only use it once a week and the remaining week I just spray water on my hair and it activates.  No frizzle hair, wow!  I have very tight, kinky black hair and this product works excellent on me!  I highly recommend this product for anyone with curly hair</li>
    <li> I have grey frizzy, curly, hair. NOTHING  has ever worked for my hair. Its out of control most of the time. However, this is by far the best product I have used. It does what it claims to do. Go to the web site and get familiar with how to use it. After a few tries you will get a feel for how much and methods of using. I just put a generous amount in, comb it through, and scrunch and air dry. Got tons of compliments. It helps to get a proper cut from someone who knows how to cut curly, frizzy, crazy hair. I will be reordering.</li>
    <li> I have fine curly hair (white girl hair) and when I put this product in my hair wet, provides well defined curls that keep their shape (little frizz) for up to 6 hours.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I use this for our hair.  I have fine curly hair, and she has about the same type of curl but thicker.  Works for us both.</li>
    <li> After many great reviews I was sooo looking forward to receiving this product, finding that new fave product to WOW me. Unfortunately, that did not happen. I was pleased with the amplifying and defining curls it gave (my hair is long, fine, lots of it and gets very curly with help). However, the lack of hold and hair texture was horrible. My hair felt like a wig (husband&#x27;s words) I also tried using the product in a cocktail to achieve desired results...No luck. Looks like I have another addition to my product graveyard.</li>
    <li> Ok product but didnt do great in my hair. It&#x27;s cheaper than most products. Can possibly work for less frizzy hair. My hair is SUPER frizzy. Little miss fussy head working for me</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t do much for my natural curly hair. Yes it was curly, and after scrunching it was soft, but the curl just did not hold well at all. My curls were very limp and lifeless after only an hour or so and no volume even though I blow dry with a diffuser upside down. It&#x27;s an expensive gel, and I only used this product once and I had to use almost half of the 8 oz bottle. For me I&#x27;ll just have to stick to my john Frieda dream curls that is only $5.</li>
    <li> Curly girls remember: not every product works on every type of curly hair. I am a white girl in my 40s with thin 3b curly hair.  It is medium in length and frizzy. Most of the time I just curl the whole thing to avoid the unknown. Trying my best to find products to leave my hair curly and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased Curl Keeper after reading the reviews and an online article about this stuff.  Like many of you, I have a whole store of products in my bathroom that would probably make most hoarders jealous. I have gone through about 1/4 of the bottle of this stuff (trying different ways of using it before I wrote a review).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My uses with it (and results) so far:  (Note: I wash my hair with Deva Curl shampoo and conditioner.  I put a leave-in conditioner in and from there I have experimented.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First round:  I added about 3 palm-fulls to wet hair and squelched (the process of holding hair upside down and squeezing until you hear a &amp;#34;squelch&amp;#34; sound&amp;#34; - some call it &amp;#34;scrunching&amp;#34;) my hair.  I diffused it and then tried to style it.  It was fine - had to play with it a lot to get the &amp;#34;wet look&amp;#34; to go away.  It did keep the hold and possibly provided some volume.  Didn&#x27;t really have the shine I was looking for though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second round:  I put about 2 palm-fulls to wet hair and squelched and put a fine mist of Kenra hairspray.  Diffused and had to play with to get the stiff look gone. Not as stiff as with gels though - which is a big plus. Was fine, but again, no shine I was hoping for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third round: 2 palm-fulls to wet hair and also added a bit (couple pumps) of deva curl mouse (I had a trial size left over).  Diffused.  Was better, but again, nothing more amazing than other products. Seemed like about the same results as when I just used the mouse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4th round:  2 palm-fulls to wet hair and added a small amount of deva curl cream.  Diffused.  Better with the texture, but limited shine.  I love the deva curl cream in terms of the texture it gives me - but it really cuts down on the shine.  Seems the most dull when I use creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems like I get the best shine with gels, but also the most &amp;#34;crunchiness&amp;#34;.  I just can&#x27;t seem to let it air dry yet.  That may add the shine I am looking for. And so the experimentation continues...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros:  It is lightweight and provides some hold.  You can add quite a bit (anything can be overdone). I did not experience any of the flaking that others mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;The cons:  Cost per ounce, availability (I only found it on Amazon), was hoping for more shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was fine and I will continue to experiment with it, but I likely won&#x27;t buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck curly-heads!

    <li> This is pretty much the only product that will convince my 13 year old to wear her hair down for the day.  She has 3A/3B curls when she lets them loose and Curl Keeper keeps them in smooth amazing ringlets all day.  It is not crunchy on her hair.  Sometimes it still looks decent enough the next day to leave it down as well.</li>
    <li> This is the only product I have found that gives me soft, support defined curls.  I love this product!</li>
    <li> Best product I have ever used for my hair. A little goes a long way so this last me awhile. My curls are defined without looking wet or feeling crunchy and the frizz is minimal!</li>
    <li> I like this product because it kept my frizz down and the second day all I had to do is add little water to activate what was left over in my hair from the day before.</li>
    <li> I have tried hundreds of products for controlling frizz. This is by far the best product I have ever used. You only need a small amount to bring out your curls and get rid of frizz. Others have complained about the smell but I don&#x27;t think it is bad. I hope this product is available for ever!</li>
    <li> Live this stuff, never been able to control my hair frizz. Not crunchy either..need to sell bigger bottles however</li>
    <li> Once again, I tried a product for curly hair and it&#x27;s always the same, my hair frizzes.  It smells great and is easy to use, but just didn&#x27;t do what it said it would for my curly, frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> Seriously the best gel I have ever used! Curls are defined and soft.</li>
    <li> Excellent  product for curly hair.</li>
    <li> I love Curly Hair Solutions Curl Keeper! I couldn&#x27;t Have a good hair day without it!</li>
    <li> This stuff works great on my wavy/frizzy hair!!</li>
    <li> Helped hold curl and eliminate frizz!</li>
    <li> Product does give curly hair a nice frizz free curl but did not like the smell.</li>
    <li> great stuff but only use a lil co&#x27;s thats all you need ty</li>
    <li> It was okay but made my hair fuzzy when I combed it out.</li>
    <li> Did nothing for my 4a coils.</li>
    <li> Package arrived quickly with a free carry bag.  Also, a $10.00 off coupon was given.  This is the first time i have used the product and I love it.  Great for curly hair.  Doesn&#x27;t make your hair sticky unless you use a lot of it.  I put it in my hair, crunch it up, and away i go.</li>
    <li> I honestly can tell no difference when this product is on. I&#x27;ve tried small amounts, large amounts, neither seems to work with my hair. It doesn&#x27;t help the frizz at all. Don&#x27;t waste your money and just try a basic cheap form of ky jelly (yes on your hair). Has the same ingredients and is only a few dollars.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised how much I liked this product. I have crazy hair at the best of times and am sick of products that build up and/or make my hair hard/crunchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that this does not build up at all. I love that it reduces my frizz substantially and I love how incredibly soft my hair feels yet helps me control my locks. I just wet my hair again the next day and away I go again. It does not get any better than that.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like going out on a limb and trying hair products without a sample first but I just tried this one and hoped for the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have 3b curls and fine hair. I used this product alone on just washed hair, it dried and hardened but I was able to shake/scrunch it all out and my hair felt very soft and the hold was decent. The next time I washed my hair I used this product and then applied my regular gel for extra hold, it came out great. My curls were held in place but the use of Curl Keeper greatly increased the softness of my hair. It feels great and I like the results. If anything, I feel the product runs out too quickly, and I&#x27;m the kind of person who can use a bottle of conditioner or gel for almost 5 months. But this is a great addition to your CurlyGirl routine, will probably purchase again.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for my hair</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like magic-water that teaches your curls how to work together in groups.  It&#x27;s pretty safe to put on your roots or ends without weighing it down or making your scalp look like you just got back from a 10K.  The smell isn&#x27;t an A+ (Biosilk/Chi smell better), but once it dries, you look like a hair commercial.</li>
    <li> Works well on my curly hair - can get a little crunchy but I just scrunch it out. Holds all day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a product that would work with my hair... FOUND IT!!!!! Curl Keeper is amazing!!!!!  I will continue to use this amazing product!!!  GOOD BYE FRIZZ!!!!! 😃</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter...she has very long, very curly hair that tends to frizz as well.  We have tried many products and this is the first one that really worked well...she LOVES it!  It gives her amazing curls and cuts the frizz a lot...I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I love this product for my curly hair. It keeps curls defined and frizz free, but isn&#x27;t heavy. I hate that crunchy feel you get from most gels and mousses. This is mich lighter and curls can be revived the next day with just a little water. It gives a much more natural look and the Amazon price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> Being a silicone hair product user, this was a big change for me.  Initially I wasn&#x27;t impressed, I had mixed both my silicone and this product.  It was hard for me to let go of what I knew worked on my unruly, curly, frizztastic hair.&lt;br /&gt;Then last week I used only this product and it made the difference in my hair.  My hair is happy and does not have static.  I never realized I had static-y hair until I used this product and it took it away so I am now loving having my hair down,  It looks better than it ever has before.  I am going to throw out the rest of my old silicone hair product and this will be my old faithful go to hair product from now on.  Also I am finally able to have 2nd day hair!  I always had terrible 2nd day hair, and now I am able to almost do 3 day hair!  For a curly girl especially this is HUGE!!&lt;br /&gt;update 1/29/14&lt;br /&gt;I have about 1/4 of my bottle left.  I can&#x27;t believe how fast I have gone through this bottle.  For the price I&#x27;m not sure if I can afford to have to buy it so often.</li>
    <li> This product works great on curly and kinky hair without adding build up or weighing hair down. I can rinse my hair the next day without washing and apply more product with the same curl defining results. Fortunately for me, the amazon warehouse must be very close. I manage to receive my shipment within 2 days even on the super saver (typically required 5- 10 days) delivery.</li>
    <li> I like this product it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or make my hair look greasy either and it definately lets me keep my curls!</li>
    <li> I really like this product but will admit I had to use an additional product for best results but it definitely made a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helped to form curls and reduce frizz very well.&lt;br /&gt;The cons : very thin and watery&lt;br /&gt;in another review someone said it smelled like old lady&lt;br /&gt;lipstick and at first sniff I didn&#x27;t smell that but it&#x27;s more like&lt;br /&gt;an aftersmell like an after taste, very odd.&lt;br /&gt;the smell could definitely be improved but after your hair&lt;br /&gt;is dried it&#x27;s hardly noticable.&lt;br /&gt;The biggest pro is that it seemed no matter how much I used&lt;br /&gt;it didn&#x27;t feel sticky or weighed down.</li>
    <li> i bought this from the many positive reviews in amazon and youtube since im currently a newby in curly hair care. I applied this product with my hair wet with my leave in conditioner, gel, mixed etc and even alone just to come up with the best outcome but at the end no matter what i tried it still left my hair crunchy and with slight white flakes? im not so sure if i would repurchase this again.</li>
    <li> Finally a product that doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell but more importantly really does work amazingly even in a light drizzle.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried Devacurl, Ouidad, Mixed Chicks, Curlisto, Fekkai, Giovanni,  Frizz Ease and probably more. This product enlivened my curls, left my hair shiny and didn&#x27;t take forever to air dry. I woke up the next morning with some curls still in my hair and could go out if I wanted to without looking like I needed to fix my hair. No hair type like 3A or 3C really describes my hair. I have let it go naturally grey, my hair is fine since becoming gray. However, with the right product my curls are amazing and gorgeous and most people would think I have lots of hair. Fekkai luscious curls does give me luscious curls as long as there is no humidity but not much shine. Mixed chicks with some creative professional mousse usually holds well in summer humidity  if I apply to almost dripping wet hair and allow to air dry. My hair tends gets frizzy even from the humidity of cooking pasta.  I did also order Bioterra styling gel as one reviewer said it holds her hair completely in Caribbean humidity when mixed with Curly Girl so I wanted to cover all bases. I&lt;br /&gt; have not used it yet but am happy with the results from Curly hair and the gel will just give me back up.</li>
    <li> I have been a \\&quot;curly girl\\&quot; for over 35 years. Tight spiral curls, very long hair. I found this product on youtube. It was recommended by Veronica Meza in her youtube video Curly Hair Tutorial with  Curly Hair Solutions. [...]. This is the only product I will ever use! Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff. I&#x27;ve always had very thick curls that were hard to manage, were very frizzy and had little definition. The only hair product I need now is curl keeper - i just rake a couple of dime-sized handfuls through my hair when it is still soaking wet (after shampooing and conditioning), then i scrunch with a microfibre towel. I let it airdry or diffuse it, scrunch out any crunch once completely dry and my hair is perfect: defined and frizz free. How easy is that? Also, to the other curlies, I would highly recommend switching to hair products that are silicone and sulfate free. In conjunction with curl keeper, this has completely changed my hair. I&#x27;m proud to be curly now.</li>
    <li> I have fine, thin hair that has some natural wave, but I recently got a curly perm. Probably like a 2b type. Really like this product. I put it in while my hair is still pretty wet, right out of the shower. Kind of have to use a lot since it&#x27;s watery. I scrunch upside down with a microfiber towel then let it air dry. It dries pretty wet/crunchy looking, but once it&#x27;s mostly dry I just flip my head upside down several times and stick my fingers into the roots to fluff things up. This makes the crunch break up and leaves me with fairly defined, soft waves/curls. Hair still looks pretty good the next day too. I can either run wet hands over the hair to tighten things up, or use a wide-toothed comb and then run wet hands/fingers through the hair and scrunch again - this gives me a softer wave, more full bodied look than the first day.</li>
    <li> Creates soft, beautiful curls with no frizz!!! I sectioned hair &amp; applied curl keeper into several sections, raked, scrunched then used diffuser. Great product for eliminating frizz that comes with thick naturally curly hair :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a curly girl and this stuff is one of the best styling products I have ever used.  It used to be hard to find as it&#x27;s shipped from Jonathan Torch&#x27;s company in Canada or another vendor that charges enormous shipping rates.  Now I can get it through Amazaon and get it in 2 days using my Amazon Prime.  Love it, love Amazon!</li>
    <li> For me as far it is good as I expected when i saw a review on youtube about it ...... .. ..</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 3 years and it is the best product for naturally curly hair.</li>
    <li> Not for my type of hair. My hair is very thin and this product dried my hair instantly.</li>
    <li> I Am always looking for products that can go in my  daughters hair and not make it frizzy. She  is mixed black and  white and nothing works. I tried this with her ice gel and it is an amazing combo. After shower hair already brushed out I run this through her hair then run ice gel through her hair and  add a little hairspray. Lasts half the  day with out frizz</li>
    <li> I love this product. I most definitely will order again.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Keeps curls smooth and washes out easily. No smell.</li>
    <li> every curly hair ladies best friend !!&lt;br /&gt;great product</li>
    <li> The trick is to use a lot, and I mean A LOT of it, and your hair has to be dripping wet.My hair is 2c/3a and extremely frizzy. The only thing that keeps my curls without frizz is mousse and hairspray, but I hate putting that much product in my hair. Curl keeper made my hair soft to the touch and boosted my curls with no frizz. I just had to soak my hair in it. My hair is long so if I used it regularly an 8oz bottle would probably only last me two weeks tops, so I&#x27;m back on moose. I use mu curl keeper when I want a lot of curls, or when I know I&#x27;m going to have a long day and want my hair to look good throughout. It does give your hair a bit of a crunch but it&#x27;s easy to get that out.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the worst product ever! Dried my hair out, when said to make hair soft and bouncy! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product! I have really crazy curly hair - curly in places ans straight in others. It just frizzes out if I &amp;#34;go natural&amp;#34;. This stuff tames the frizz so well even in rain or snow and gives me defined curls. I also really love that it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling stiff and sticky. GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> I bought this product because it got such rave reviews.  The first time I tried it, i was a little disappointed at first because it left my hair feeling stiff.  But after &amp;#34;scrunching out the crunch&amp;#34; I was left with soft, perfect curls, and now I couldn&#x27;t be happier. It&#x27;s true it does have a sort of distinctive smell to it - not especially horrible but not amazing either.  Still, I think it&#x27;s well worth it!</li>
    <li> I really struggle to find good hair products for curly hair.  A lot of times I think it has to do more with getting the right hair stylist to cut your hair.  The past few months mine has not had as much volume and gotten frizzy throughout the day.  I had seen a photo on pinterest and a blog written by a women with curly hair and this was one of her recommendations.  I feel like I spend a lot of money on hair products to have good hair and volume, and I will say that this was worth it.  She did say that she used a fair amount, you can&#x27;t put too much on.  It holds the curl without being a crunch gel, and it runs right through your fingers.  I use Ouidad conditioning cream then I put a little bit of pantene curly hair mousse, then this, and then go to drying.  I dry upside down on high heat but low air flow for about 10 minutes, then flip my head upright, add some redken curl spray, and continue drying.  I think this stuff is one of the better products I have tried.</li>
    <li> I have frizzy, nearly unmanageable curly hair. Not only does this product tame and define curl, it also allows for a nearly perfect refresh with just a little water. I work a dime size amount through root to end and blow dry as normal. Later in the day (or even the next morning) a quick spritz with water has my curl bouncing back as though I&#x27;ve just styled it. This is one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair. I&#x27;ll definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and apply it after my leave-in and before my mousse. I scrunch, then plop the hair into a long sleeved tshirt and finish getting ready.  The end result is soft, bouncy, touchable curls that last all day and can be easily reactivated the second day with a little water.  LOVE it!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this after 30 years of wrestling with frizzy, bushy, unmanageably wavy/curly hair. Read the reviews, but honestly didn&#x27;t expect it do do much, if anything. And let me just say, this stuff is amazing! I usually put a handful in my hair straight out of the shower, blot/scrunch my hair with a towel (a microfiber towel works better, but I don&#x27;t always have one on hand), and then either let it dry naturally or hit it with a blow dryer + diffuser. If you use the diffuser, try laying your hair on it and pushing it up towards your scalp, so that it&#x27;s just laying as a bunch on top of the diffuser. Crazy curl town!</li>
    <li> Curl Keeper is great! I have thick yet fine, long blonde hair. My hair was always frizzy and the curls wouldn&#x27;t stay together...it just became a big mess! I used all kinds of products and I can say that I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks and it is the best thing I have found yet! I love that it doesn&#x27;t cause any product build-up in my hair (because it is water-based) and it just DOES IT&#x27;S JOB. Plain and simple. I love it and will definitely be buying it again!</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and for the last year I have been avoiding the natural style of my hair with straighteners and curling irons. I wanted to start doing my hair curly again and was looking for great products that would help my hair get healthy again and started on the curlygirl method and since this product had great reviews I wanted to give it a try. I tried it four times and every time I tried using with other products underneath and on top of, and also by itself. I had the worse frizz ever, the only thing I like about it, is that it is easily distributed and it washes out really easy. It is to light of a product to hold my curls frizz free and it seems to tamper with the other products that I tried to use with it.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I have very thick long natural curly hair and it took the frizz away, holds the curl and no hard crunch.  I will never use anything else. Customer for life!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for the smell but I really like this...especially in spring and summer because it kills frizz even on my super curly hair.  I use it with a gel for more hold.</li>
    <li> My curly hair has driven me crazy. I have used Curly Hair Solutions for about 5 years and their stuff keeps everything under control.&lt;br /&gt;There is no odor and it recharges when you wet your hair.</li>
    <li> Curl Keeper is one of the few universally loved curly hair products. It works well for my thicker spiral curls as well as family member&#x27;s finer wavy hair. It&#x27;s not exactly a gel per se, rather a lightweight fluid that prevents frizz. For those with finer curls, it might suffice as a standalone product. With thicker or coarse hair, it can be combined with other products. The best part about it is that it plays nicely with any other hair product I use. I put this on wet hair first, then layer on anything else I&#x27;m using. It does have a scent that reminds me of lipstick. However, the scent isn&#x27;t strong and goes away after your hair dries. Curl Keeper doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down or leave a sticky residue, just soft, bouncy curls.</li>
    <li> I heard about this product from a YouTube tutorial about getting perfect curls.  The girl who was in the video had amazing hair and she said that this was her &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; product.  I had to try it.  It is not really a gel, but more like a runny, kind of sticky substance. I had my doubts when I put it on my hair from the consistency.  I was shocked at what this did for my natural curls.  The were soft and not &amp;#34;crispy&amp;#34; after drying with a diffuser.  My hair is very curly and it&#x27;s so hard to find a product that keeps my curls in tact without frizz, but this stuff did the trick!  It&#x27;s really kind of a miracle for hair.  Most people with naturally curly hair know that it&#x27;s bad to wash it everyday, but it&#x27;s hard not to when I wake up and my curls are destroyed!  With this product, you simply spray hair with water and it magically reactivates itself and hair is perfect again.  It&#x27;s pretty unbelievable- I&#x27;m 31 and have been searching for this kind of magic treatment for my hair all my life.  I usually straighten my hair since my curls get so frizzy and unruly by the end of the day.  Now I love my curly hair.  I would recommend anyone with any type of curly hair to buy this! It&#x27;s well worth the price!</li>
    <li> This product is cheaper than similar products (I used to use Ouidad). It works better on my hair and does not give me the scalp itch I get from many other products.</li>
    <li> I have 3b-3c curls, and this product made it crunchy and hard plus it left white residue on my black hair:(</li>
    <li> I originally found this in a Birchbox. When I went to order a full size bottle, I checked Amazon to see if there was a price difference, and it was a bit cheaper. It may seem expensive for a hair tamer, but a little goes a long way. My 8oz bottles usually lasts me 5-6 months and I have medium-long length hair. It&#x27;s non-greasy and very soft after it dries. Highly recommend to anyone who has curly hair but wants to avoid frizz and crunch.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my fine curls, still frizzed</li>
    <li> This is the best thing that has ever happened to me! It reaaly does control frizz and leaves hair shiny and soft. The only thing I dislike about it is that u have to apply ALOT for it to do its magic. I feel like Im using way too much product but its still definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I no longer have to blow dry my hair.  I comb some through, add more product with my hands, scrunch and go.  The next day I wet my hair and it brings it back to curly. Amazing!</li>
    <li> Great product. Helps curl form but does not leave residue or weigh down hair.</li>
    <li> Dear curly hair girls:&lt;br /&gt;Throw away your straighteners. You are about to love your curly hair. This product is amazing. It&#x27;s making me start to love the hair I used to hate. It defines my curls so well! I watched a video on YouTube about how to use it and it worked perfectly.</li>
    <li> It seems like I&#x27;m always battling with frizz on the outer layer and crown of my 2C head.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because my hair is coming in grey more and more or because I&#x27;m prone to dryness, but it&#x27;s been a constant battle to deal with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up trying out this product based on the positive recommendations of some wavy gals on the Naturally Curly forums, and I&#x27;m really impressed! It has cut down on my frizz more than any other product I have tried -- and believe me when I tell you that I am a product junkie!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like any new hair product, there is a bit of a learning curve with this.  The first time I used it, I used way too much, and ended up with greasy-looking hair.  About two quarter-sized amounts seem to work best on my fine waves, which reach down to about four inches below my shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the order of products I use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--leave-in conditioner + Curl Keeper + my curl cream/enhancer of the day + gel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything gets scrunched into super wet hair.  I then plop in a microfiber towel before diffusing it dry.  My current LI is [[ASIN:B00099Z2OQ Giovanni Hair Care - Direct Leave-In Conditioner, 8.5 fl oz liquid]], and I use [[ASIN:B000N2IGWY AG Hair Re Coil Curl Activator (6 oz)]] or Spiral Solutions or mousse as my curl cream/enhancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re following the Curly Girl Method of no silicones or sulfates, this is also CG-friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a pricey product, but it really does deliver results!</li>
    <li> Love this product for my curly hair!  I am always on a quest to find a product that won&#x27;t make my hair crunchy, weighed down or make my scalp itch.  Worth a try for you!  I use a hairdryer with this product.</li>
    <li> Works great on my 2a/2b curls. After showering I plop my hair in a microfiber towel to pull out the excess water after s2c. Once my hair is a little drier I squish in some leave in conditioner, a good amount of curl keeper, and plop again in a new microfiber towel. I usually like to air dry my tummy length hair (with good results) but sometimes I don&#x27;t have hours to wait for it to dry so I use my diffuser. I get AMAZING results every time. So far Curl Keeper is the best product I&#x27;ve used in my hair and helps me stick to the CG method.</li>
    <li> This product actually made my hair less curly.  I watched youtube video&#x27;s for how to&#x27;s and followed the instructions.  This just weighed down my curls and made them useless.  I plopped my hair. I twisted the semi curly hairs. I clipped at my part.  I tried it air dry and with a difuser. None gave me good curls.  I have much better luck with DEVACURL gel.  I think this may work better for super curly hair.  I could see it keeping nice ringlets if that were the case.  I wish curly hair products specified which curl types they work best for so I didn&#x27;t have to waste my money.</li>
    <li> WHY YES! I am in love! This is and will be my favorite hair product! Just scrunch the crunch out and you are good to go!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this product when I made the decision to purchase it. I have been through countless other brands that promised to eliminate frizz and keep curls feeling and looking healthy, naturally, that had failed to deliver, and I have spent an absurd amount to get here. This product, however, is different from the others. Not only does it achieve desired results, it lasts a good while. I have very thick medium length curly 3A hair. I received this formula at the beginning of April, and still have a little less than half of an 8 oz bottle to go (it is now April 28). This is from daily use and applying generous amounts to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one product has become a mandatory staple for me now. I have forgotten about mousses and creams and the (some of them super expensive) haircare products formulated strictly with curly hair in mind. Literally all I need anymore is my conditioner and Curl Keeper. I just apply it with my hands, comb my fingers through and scrunch with a microfiber towel, and I&#x27;m ready to go. Any other scrunching needed afterward is entirely tolerated. This stuff defines  my curls, gives them amazing shine and bounce, and keeps them frizz free. In short, it keeps my hair beautiful, and I love it. ;)</li>
    <li> Does it&#x27;s job. Smells great and most importantly works!. Just be careful about how much you put on. Someone mention you can never put too much of this product on and it be too much, and I took that advice my first time and slathered myhair with I only to have it dry sticky and crunchy. (I have wavy hair with tighter curls at the nape that tends to dry really slowly. My hair felt crunchy and I looked like I had just stepped out of the &#x27;80s with the &amp;#34;wet look&amp;#34;. Brushing it out made it less hard , but it lost some of the frizz control because of it. Use a quarter size at at first and rub your hands together and run it from root to tip. Let it dry a bit before you apply more. Just my two cents.</li>
    <li> This is a great product to use on top of my cream for curly hair.  If I just use this product, it makes my hair crunchy.  I just use a little bit on the ends.  I have super curly, frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> Update 04/26/13:  I decided to give this product another shot.  I found that for my particular 3A hair that is now 26 inches long, I must wrap it in a microfiber towel to dry it for at least 30 mins before using this product.  Then I have to use some kind of leave in conditioner.  Right now I am using Garnier Fructis Hydra Recharge Moisture Whip or their Sleek &amp; Shine Leave-In Conditioning Cream.  Then I apply curl keeper using the *rake n shake* technique, I let it dry naturally and it will dry to a crunch.  However, once completely dry I *crunch* the crunchiness.  I am then left with soft, frizz-free, manageable shiny curls and absolutely no flakes!  I really like it now and purchased the 1 liter Bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Old Review:  I have long curly hair when straightened measures about 24 inches, I could not figure out how to use this product without it causing an odd drying effect.  My hair is very shiny and soft normally,  I was hoping to find a product that would not cause crunchiness as so many curly hair products do.  I tried diffusing with this product but I prefer to let my hair to dry naturally.  I&#x27;m thinking this product just isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I&#x27;ve always had partially curly hair ringlets close to my face and underneath but outer pieces were more wavy. But this products helps the natural curl of my hair and gives it the moisture it needs. I have always felt like other products weighed down my hair. This product is lightweight. Still trying to use it properly to help reduce all of the frizz, but my hair is partially fried because of prior coloring/ heat damage. I recommend this product to anyone with curly/wavy hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* No one asked me to write a review. This is was done on my own. I originally found out about this product from a Youtube tutorial and the girl (Veronica) used this product. I loved how her hair looked so I decided to give it a try. Only complaint is that it is pricey for the amount that you get.</li>
    <li> I absolutely freaking love this stuff. My hair is more wavy/curly, not cute little ringlets, so if I put no product in it I just look completely unkempt and possibly homeless. I have tried numerous gels and creams and mousses over the years...and all of them either made my hair look crunchy, made it feel sticky, didn&#x27;t do anything at all, or a combination of those. I&#x27;ve been on a constant search for my holy grail of curly hair product for 15 years. Well I found it! With this my curls are more defined and glossy, frizz is practically gone, my hair doesn&#x27;t look or feel crunchy at all, and my hair feels soft with no greasy/sticky/gross feeling at all. It&#x27;s perfect!</li>
    <li> I just bought this stuff to try it on the recomendation of a co-worker. She has really curly hair like curly sue had in the movie. Ok that is telling my age. Anyways so far so good. Today was the first day I used it. I feel that it did a decent job. I will update my review if needed but I like this stuff so far. :)</li>
    <li> Just have a question. I recently receive the product and the bottle looks used and is not  sealed. Did anyone else&#x27;s bottle come like this? I&#x27;m not comfortable using it.</li>
    <li> I bought samples of this product and I have good and bad things to say.  Bad thing was it dries really crunchy but that wasn&#x27;t a problem for me because I would scrunch my hair and get the crunch out.  Good thing using one good treatment soaking my hair down did give me a week of frizz free curls.  I had to manipulate each morning with a little water and I had frizz free curls.  My biggest problem it really dried out my scalp.  The first week I had really bad flakes all over my head.  I had to treat my scalp with tea tree oil and then wash and oil my scalp with coconut oil every day.  I thought maybe it was a fluke so I tried again the second week because I liked how long my curls lasted.  By the 4th day my scalp was full of flakes again.  This wasn&#x27;t flaking from the product it was really dry scalp.  I had to scratch the flakes from my head and it was really bad.  I have never had that happen.  Decided that would be my last try at using curl keeper.  Glad I only got samples.  I do have 3 sample pkts left.  Sure wish I could&#x27;ve kept using.</li>
    <li> This thing is horrible. It dries out my curls and leave them crispy and stiff. I have long curly hair that falls in the middle of my back, and after reading the reviews I thought it would be perfect to tame it, I was wrong! I was expecting my curls to be soft and bouncy, and with some luster, but this thing takes it all away. What a waste of my money!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  I&#x27;ve been doing the curly girl method for about two months and was not really happy with the gel I was using to hold my curls.  I went in search of something better, and something that would help with the frizz and kind of randomly stumbled across this stuff while looking at other products.  I put this in after my leave in, comb through with a wide tooth comb and then just give it a few scrunches and leave it alone until it dries.  All I have to do when it does is shake my head a little and BAM! Soft clumpy curls, exactly what I was hoping for when I started cg.  I hated the gel I was using because I always had to scrunch the crunch out and then it would get frizzy and my hair still wouldn&#x27;t move naturally.  I bought this in the 8oz size but when it runs out, I will definitely be investing in the bigger one.  I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my hair lately and I&#x27;ve NEVER gotten that before.</li>
    <li> it did&#x27;t work at all it did nothing for my hair i have frezzy and it made it more frezzy</li>
    <li> I have not noticed a difference with this product. So honestly I am not sure what to say other than my experience has been.....&amp;#34;I do not see or feel a difference.&amp;#34; I can do without this one in my hair routine.</li>
    <li> Holds curls great! Makes doing my hair sooo easy!!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It&#x27;s great to use alone, as well as layering it.  Personally my favorite concoction (at the moment) is Curl Keeper with ReCoil.  Good mix of light and heavier holds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curl Keeper is super light, nice and defining, and when you scrunch your hair, it leaves almost no visible signs that you have product in your hair--just gorgeous light bouncy curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a few sections of hair that don&#x27;t like to curl as much as the others, so when it&#x27;s being ornery, that&#x27;s when I put in some ReCoil to help them out a little.</li>
    <li> Best product I have found for my curly hair ever!  I ran out and was using other products and just came back to this one, I love it!  Get many compliments on my hair whenever I use it.</li>
    <li> I am 44 years old with red curly frizzy hair, well I was frizzy.  i have been trying out products my entire life. thank curly solutions i finally found the only one that works! and it doesnt make my hair hard or sticky!!!</li>
    <li> makes curls last without frizz. only a little bit is needed.no harsh chemicals so its more gentle on hair. love this stuff.</li>
    <li> The Curl Keeper is a great purchase for those of us with curly hair. It truly does tame your curls from frizz. It is a must buy for anyone with curly hair. If you have already brought every product out there, what does it hurt to try one more. I PROMISE this product really works! So, I guarantee you will not be disappointed.

To read the rest of my review, please visit the blog (Krazy Coupon Club)! Above is just a small portion of my thoughts. - B</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING! I recommend every curly haired women to try this product. I thought I was hopeless finding something for my unmanageable, curly, frizzy hair until I saw this product being used on a YouTube tutorial. I was a bit hesitant trying it because I&#x27;ve bought so many different products hoping something could keep my curls nicely maintained without looking dry and frizzy but this Curly hair solution worked wonders on my crazy puffy hair. if you want to try it I suggest you start with the small bottle to see if you like it.&lt;br /&gt;You will not regret buying it!</li>
    <li> Works great! i like that you can re-wet the piece of hair that goes frizzy and the product works again!</li>
    <li> I found this product after watching a girls youtube video.  I have thin but a lot of Curly hair that is soft and not dry.  I love how this makes my hair feel! I do use it with a mouse for some more control (without crunch) and I don&#x27;t use as much as others say to use- but I will definitely order again!</li>
    <li> This product only made my hair more frizzy. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it at all. I have no idea why it has great reviews from others.</li>
    <li> I am natural and decided to purchase this based on good reviews.  I will say that I was happy while applying it.  It distrubted easily in my hair and really defined my curls. My hair looked  terrific while it was wet, but after it dried, my hair looked extremely dry, almost ashy gray and was awfully crunchy.  Even putting moisturizer on top didn&#x27;t help much.</li>
    <li> I have 3b white hair and I&#x27;m fighting the frizz and dryness while trying to keep the color white and not yellow. By the time I use enough of this product to conquer the frizz, my hair looks oily. So I am using a couple of squirts of this in my homemade morning spritz, so it is not being wasted. But I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. I do love the natural ingredients though. Too bad it&#x27;s just not good for my locks.</li>
    <li> Best product for curlies.</li>
    <li> Great product. Good for frizzy hair. My hair did not feel stiff with this product.</li>
    <li> Best gel for natural curly hair.  Doesn&#x27;t get stiff or sticky and keeps the frizz away.</li>
    <li> I love it. My curls look great. I have had sooo many compliments on my curly hair Thank you so much for all the tuturials on this product. It is amazing!!!!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;t</li>
    <li> I like the product but it does give the wet hair look that I didn&#x27;t want. No fizz and my curls are better. Just wish the smell of it was a little more appealing.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product. I have fine 3a hair that gets frizzy and weighed down by everything. This product left my hair curly, bouncy and full of body. I had a little more frizz than I get with gel, but overall, it was nicer than gel, a different look really. Very happy with this!</li>
    <li> I received this the other day, finally had a chance to use it yesterday. I have naturally curly hair that 98% of the time I straighten it. Never really comfortable with my hair curly...and yes, it&#x27;s because I was made fun of as a kid. But now, people pay an arm and a leg for the curl I have!!&lt;br /&gt;  Anyway...I was told about this product by a friend who has curl troubles just like I do. So, I fully trust her opinion. I read reviews, thought for the size, the price was right. Although it&#x27;s been a little over a week since I ordered it and the price has magically doubled...&lt;br /&gt;  Finally got to use the stuff yesterday, watched a video or two suggesting how to use. Did my normal routine with application and drying...this stuff is AMAZING!!!!  It&#x27;s beyond amazing!!!  It&#x27;s the most spectacular product I have ever used for curl!!!  This product provides exactly what it promises and MORE!!!  I couldn&#x27;t wait to leave the house with curly hair today!!!&lt;br /&gt;  Going to order a surplus now!!!</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t reach full expectations</li>
    <li> This is great for calming my frizzy hair. It doesn&#x27;t contain silicone but can be drying if left in over 2 days without washing. It also works great on humid days. I use this product and the Shea moisture line for my hair and so far it is working great.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!!! I have tightly permed curly hair that is long. This works on washed hair and hair that has been dampened. All I use is about a quarter-size of the solution and leave it alone until it is dry. The next day I just spray my hair with water and it comes back perfect. I have tried the grocery/drug store brands but none have performed like Curl Keeper.</li>
    <li> Helps define curls. I use it underneath my Aveda gel.</li>
    <li> I have at this late dae discovered that I can love my curly grey hair and this stuff is wonderful for holding them.  I will never be without it!  It arrived safely and quickly.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work whatsoever, but customer service was excellent.  It was the same as any other curly hair product, but more expensive. I was really disappointed with this product.  There&#x27;s no magic in it at all.</li>
    <li> Love it just wish it wasn&#x27;t so drying</li>
    <li> I think this product does pretty good on my hair. There were  few things that did confuse me about it. The biggest was the smell! If you order this from the curlyhairsolutions.com website, it does not smell the way this one does. This one smells REALLY bad! I ordered this from amazon because my bank has to go through a special process before it will allow me access to order the curl keeper--the company is  based in Canada and I think that&#x27;s why. And the bottle design of this one is a bit different than the actual. It is an ok product. I feel like it might not be the real Curl Keeper product though.</li>
    <li> I have thin-ish but very curly hair (not coarse). I bought this &amp;#34;serum&amp;#34; because my friend recommended it. I really like it, though I usually need to also use either a little Pantene Pro-V gel for curly hair or something else for extra strength. This product is thin and not very gooey so you can accidentally use too much which can make your hair seem greasy. I do like it overall though and it allows your hair to be touchable and soft and not crunchy.</li>
    <li> it makes my curls feel very light and natural. I will definitely be using it for good from now on.</li>
    <li> I love DevaCurl products and after watching a How-To video with  Curl Keeper, I was excited to try it. I live in New Orleans, and I heard that it worked great in the humidity. Instead it weighed down my curls and left them soft, and frizz free yet completely undefined. Back to DevaCurl, I go! Curl Keeper did give me a softer beachy waves however, so if you are someone with short hair that doesn&#x27;t want tight curls, this could be a nice option.&lt;br /&gt;Might still use this as a de-frizz serum in conjunction with other products.</li>
    <li> product is good but you have to use alot of it so the bottle doesnt last as long.  so I really dont know if its worth paying that much money for it when it doesnt last.  I have also noticed the hair tends to get dry after awhile using this.</li>
</ol>
