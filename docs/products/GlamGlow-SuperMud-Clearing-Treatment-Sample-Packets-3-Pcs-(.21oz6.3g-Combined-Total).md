      <li>It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t do more than a 2$ mask at walmart !</li>
      <li>in all, this mask is amazing.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast and received it in no time and the price was great !</li>
      <li>I know this product is raved and ranted about, but my experience with it was honestly so-so.</li>
      <li>The samples are great and is good for one application on the whole face or many uses if you just do spot treatments.</li>
      <li>Let&#x27;s be honest though, you can never have too many makeup</li>
      <li>Im in love with this product</li>
      <li>Love the product.</li>
      <li>I love this product and I was even happier when I got my package</li>
      <li>I put the mask on my face and i love it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve seen people use brushes, and I think it would have been better with using a brush application.  </li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any better than any mask you can get over the counter.</li>
      <li>I was glad I was able to to try this with out spending $40-$70.  </li>
      <li>I love this face mask.</li>
      <li>I am glad I bought the sample packs before buying a jar of this stuff.</li>
      <li>Cool to watch and amazing for your skin</li>
      <li>I ordered this for my fifteen year old and she has tried one packet and it worked great...</li>
      <li>sweet to yourself!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I got to try this product without having to shell out a minimum of $40 for the full size jar.</li>
      <li>I think it kind of helps clear your skin but doesnt make a significant difference.</li>
      <li>I plan on buying the full size.</li>
      <li>It smells good to me and does help minutely, but I can&#x27;t imagine I&#x27;ll buy this mask again- especially at that price!</li>
      <li>Used the samples and then had to purchase the full size.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really not bad at all.</li>
      <li>I also do spot treatment on my zits, it helps bring up the oiliness so it helps get rid of acne quickly.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to try this after so many good reviews but just couldn&#x27;t get past the price of a jar of it.</li>
      <li>I suffer from clogged pores resulting in a great deal of black heads on my nose and chin and redness on my checks.</li>
      <li>It does exactly what it says it does!</li>
      <li>I was hesitant to buy the large bottle since it was nearly $70, I was thrilled to find these samples.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;After one, 20 minute use, my skin is super soft, smooth, and clean.</li>
      <li>this mask is fun bc</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really, really worth</li>
      <li>This is a good product for someone who wants to clear their skin of some impurities and who wants softer skin.</li>
      <li>A face mask is always fun though.</li>
      <li>it can be used as a spot treatment or on whole face, its super absorbent, and you cam see the results</li>
      <li>So glad I tried these samples before purcashing the big one.</li>
      <li>Just tried this for the first time.</li>
      <li>Also the shipping was fast!</li>
      <li>so I settled on testing it out with these samples first</li>
      <li>Glad I only bought the sample.</li>
      <li>But instead ordered these to test it out first.  </li>
      <li>i tested it out first.</li>
      <li>Besides the dryness, I really like seeing it pull things from my pores!</li>
      <li>I bought these samples to try before making up my mind about buying the real product, I used it several times and it makes my skin so smooth!</li>
      <li>I still don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m willing to spend $40 - $60 on the real product though.</li>
      <li>You can get these EXACT same samples from Sephora for FREE.</li>
      <li>It also had little chunks in it as well, which felt kinda nice as I rubbed it</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall the actual products are great, I would say they are a little over hyped but still</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>I really like this treatment.</li>
      <li>it was the neatest thing to see it draw out so much.</li>
      <li>I am prepared for this, so heads up to everyone else who wants to try this mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>let it sit for twenty minutes, then used a wet washcloth around my hairline to make sure I didn&#x27;t smoosh some into my hair.</li>
      <li>The very pores that got me bullied to heck</li>
      <li>It also came with a sample body wash that I didn&#x27;t really care for smell of.</li>
      <li>This mask is so gentle.</li>
      <li>There is way to much hype about it.</li>
      <li>REALLY WORKS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>These aren&#x27;t big samples, but enough to get the idea of how the product would work for you, without purchasing the full size first.</li>
      <li>This literally erased my pores and removed the God-awful blackheads on my nose and under my bottom lip, right above my chin.</li>
      <li>I left mine on for 15 minutes total and longer would have been fine too, I think.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The mask is kind of thin and runny, which really makes it easier to spread evenly.</li>
      <li>My skin felt very soft after.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Makes your skin feel so soft!</li>
      <li>This product does exactly what it says and made my skin feel softer and my pores way smaller!</li>
      <li>, my three little packets came with this super cute little zipper bag.</li>
      <li>My skin is very rarely oily or dry, but I suffer from blackheads on my nose and chin occasionally.</li>
      <li>I will definitely buy the large container.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been fighting severe acne, combination oily-dry skin, and rosacea since I was 12, and it&#x27;s followed me all the way to early adulthood.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found that the occasional baking soda scrub down, combined with my new hyaluronic acid, facial brush, and moisturizing routine has done significantly more for both problem areas and overall skin quality-</li>
      <li>I just actually picked up one today of the new Thirsty Mud</li>
      <li>, given my severe acne and generally crappy skin, I was expecting this junk to burn like a mo-fo.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s white with orange and green floral print, not super cheaply made, but not super strong either.</li>
      <li>The rest ofthe mask rinsed right off with a little rubbing.</li>
      <li>My rosacea was a little more pink than it was before the mask, but it didn&#x27;t hurt, feel dry, or inflamed.</li>
      <li>packet was more than enough for my face, and when the directions say to apply a thin layer evenly over your face, they aren&#x27;t kidding.</li>
      <li>However, it&#x27;s kind of expensive for daily use.</li>
      <li>After using the product I noticed unusually large black heads on my face.</li>
      <li>My review may be skewed by the fact that I&#x27;m fairly certain the samples I received were moderately dried out.</li>
      <li>I put a little too much on one cheek, and it didn&#x27;t do the kinda-gross-but-still-neat oil spots like it was supposed to.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought these samples to try before making up my mind about buying the real product, I used it several times and it makes my skin so smooth! I would recommend doing a face mask once a week. I also do spot treatment on my zits, it helps bring up the oiliness so it helps get rid of acne quickly. I still don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m willing to spend $40 - $60 on the real product though.</li>
    <li> So glad I tried these samples before purcashing the big one. I think it kind of helps clear your skin but doesnt make a significant difference. Go with something cheaper like Aztec healing clay that gets the job done without breaking the bank.</li>
    <li> You can get these EXACT same samples from Sephora for FREE. I just actually picked up one today of the new Thirsty Mud (blue)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the actual products are great, I would say they are a little over hyped but still definitely something to try.</li>
    <li> I did not see a difference. Glad I only bought the sample.</li>
    <li> This is a good product for someone who wants to clear their skin of some impurities and who wants softer skin. From what I read, I thought this product would clear everything bad from my skin but it didn&#x27;t quite get everything out. I did have softer and less red skin after I used this mask. Overall, I give it a B+.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my fifteen year old and she has tried one packet and it worked great...it was the neatest thing to see it draw out so much.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved it! I ended up buying the jar! Im in love with this product</li>
    <li> this mask is fun bc it can be used as a spot treatment or on whole face, its super absorbent, and you cam see the results</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy the large bottle since it was nearly $70, I was thrilled to find these samples.  If I only put the mask on my nose I can get 3-4 uses out of each sample pack.  Truly the best product to clean my pores out.  I will definitely buy the large container.  Smells great, hardens and pulls out impurities, I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t take care of my daughter&#x27;s black heads. I&#x27;m happy I bought the samples instead of the pricy jar. It&#x27;s just a lot of money for a so-so mask. It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t do more than a 2$ mask at walmart !</li>
    <li> Item was just as described and last shipping as well</li>
    <li> I love this product and I was even happier when I got my package and there was an extra glam glow sample of the youth mud mask. Although when I tried that one it burned my face. It also came with a sample body wash that I didn&#x27;t really care for smell of.</li>
    <li> It seems like it just dried my skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I got to try this product without having to shell out a minimum of $40 for the full size jar. This product does exactly what it says and made my skin feel softer and my pores way smaller!</li>
    <li> Not as impressed as I thought I would be with the product! Shipping was fast and received it in no time and the price was great !</li>
    <li> Maybe it is because I only had the samples and didn&#x27;t use the product regularly but I did not notice any difference in my skin.  It didn&#x27;t draw away impurities the way pinterest and other sites made it seem. A face mask is always fun though.</li>
    <li> I know this product is raved and ranted about, but my experience with it was honestly so-so. I&#x27;m not entirely convinced that the dots that appear in the dried mask are, in fact, &#x27;facial impurities&#x27; as much as anything else. My review may be skewed by the fact that I&#x27;m fairly certain the samples I received were moderately dried out. Though the mask did improve the appearance of my skin through temporary tightening and brightening, it did nothing to alter blackheads or stubborn spots. My skin is very rarely oily or dry, but I suffer from blackheads on my nose and chin occasionally. I&#x27;ve found that the occasional baking soda scrub down, combined with my new hyaluronic acid, facial brush, and moisturizing routine has done significantly more for both problem areas and overall skin quality- and the three were about the same price on amazon. It smells good to me and does help minutely, but I can&#x27;t imagine I&#x27;ll buy this mask again- especially at that price!</li>
    <li> Love the product. I realized they were sample packets but there was very little product in them.</li>
    <li> A little pricy for samples.  but one packet will cover your face.  Product works as advertised.  I was glad I was able to to try this with out spending $40-$70.  So for that I guess its a &amp;#34;reasonable&amp;#34; price.</li>
    <li> Love it! Makes your skin feel so soft!</li>
    <li> can i have a tub of this please!!! OMG the best</li>
    <li> Just tried this for the first time. I was a little skeptical about how well it would actually work, but it actually did. My skin felt very soft after. I have very sensitive skin and I did not experience any burning. The scent was pleasant.  I left mine on for 15 minutes total and longer would have been fine too, I think. It is a little hard to spread. I only had a makeup sponge that I dabbed the mask on with and it was a little difficult.  I&#x27;ve seen people use brushes, and I think it would have been better with using a brush application.  Other than that I plan on buying the full size.</li>
    <li> Came in in the earlier of the expected shipping dates. I was worried that the small packet wouldn&#x27;t cover my whole face, but it did. Also, the product dried out my skin a little, but I tend to have sensitive skin. Besides the dryness, I really like seeing it pull things from my pores!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see a difference in applying the mini supermud clearing, maybe the sample packs weren&#x27;t  enough for my skin.</li>
    <li> Made me break out but helped my blackheads a little</li>
    <li> After using the product I noticed unusually large black heads on my face. It also made me break out really badly. I won&#x27;t be recommending this to anyone to try.</li>
    <li> These sames are great. I didnt want to buy the 70 buck jar untill i tested it out first. I put the mask on my face and i love it. The samples are great and is good for one application on the whole face or many uses if you just do spot treatments.</li>
    <li> Used the samples and then had to purchase the full size.  It is amazing getting to see the oil/impurities being PULLED from my face!  These aren&#x27;t big samples, but enough to get the idea of how the product would work for you, without purchasing the full size first.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this after so many good reviews but just couldn&#x27;t get past the price of a jar of it. I suffer from clogged pores resulting in a great deal of black heads on my nose and chin and redness on my checks. I was pretty disappointed. This by no means made my sink any worse but I didnt see any type of improvement either.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the product. I was afraid to take the plunge and order the full size bottle because of the extreme cost so I settled on testing it out with these samples first and I am very happy that I did! The product exceeds my expectations and these are convenient packs to take while I travel.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s awesome and my skin felt wonderful! It does exactly what it says it does! Cool to watch and amazing for your skin</li>
    <li> Great idea if you just want to try it out. I love the glamglow mud!!</li>
    <li> I am glad I bought the sample packs before buying a jar of this stuff. It&#x27;s alright but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any better than any mask you can get over the counter. There is way to much hype about it. Was not spectacular and did not really help my complexion at all.</li>
    <li> I was going to buy the $70 dollar jar from saphoria. But instead ordered these to test it out first.  I love this face mask. It pulled out a lot of my black heads and made my face feel really soft. I&#x27;d suggest putting a lotion on after removing it. Since it does slightly dry your face out. I would definitely buy again! Also the shipping was fast! Came in about a week.</li>
    <li> I really like this treatment. It works well, especially on blackheads. You can literally see it working! However, it&#x27;s kind of expensive for daily use.</li>
    <li> great shipping. didn&#x27;t see results from the mask though. thanks</li>
    <li> Not enough to cover my neck!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been fighting severe acne, combination oily-dry skin, and rosacea since I was 12, and it&#x27;s followed me all the way to early adulthood. This works. I mean, it REALLY, REALLY WORKS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried proactive, herbal home remedies, even a prescription cream. (Yeah, acne so bad my poor-people state insurance covered treatment.) This literally erased my pores and removed the God-awful blackheads on my nose and under my bottom lip, right above my chin. Blackheads I&#x27;ve had since middle school. All gone. Poof. MAGIC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One packet was more than enough for my face, and when the directions say to apply a thin layer evenly over your face, they aren&#x27;t kidding. I put a little too much on one cheek, and it didn&#x27;t do the kinda-gross-but-still-neat oil spots like it was supposed to. It needs that thin, even layer to really work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smelled kinda minty. Also caught faint hints of maybe tea tree oil. That&#x27;s probably not an ingredient, but that&#x27;s what it smells like. It&#x27;s not super heavily scented, but it is earthy in a sort of feminine way. It&#x27;s really not bad at all. Could definitely smell the clay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask is kind of thin and runny, which really makes it easier to spread evenly. It also had little chunks in it as well, which felt kinda nice as I rubbed it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, given my severe acne and generally crappy skin, I was expecting this junk to burn like a mo-fo. It didn&#x27;t! Not even a little! I&#x27;ve used masks that hurt so bad I have to rinse my face as soon as it touches my skin. This mask is so gentle. It had a faint tingle to it, barely there and then gone when dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it dried, I could see the little dots forming where my pores were, little droplets of whatever was in my pores forming on top of the mask. It was literally sucking out the junk in my pores, like a minty vacuum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I let it sit for twenty minutes, then used a wet washcloth around my hairline to make sure I didn&#x27;t smoosh some into my hair. The rest ofthe mask rinsed right off with a little rubbing. As I was wiping away the mask, I could see already that my pores were GONE. Yes, gone. Actually gone. The very pores that got me bullied to heck and back when I was in school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blackheads were gone. My big, open pores were gone. My rosacea was a little more pink than it was before the mask, but it didn&#x27;t hurt, feel dry, or inflamed. The pores on that were gone too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After one, 20 minute use, my skin is super soft, smooth, and clean. It doesn&#x27;t look like my skin anymore. It&#x27;s so even. Not too dry, not too oily, and it&#x27;s so uniform. It&#x27;s gotten my t-zone combination crap skin to chill out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted, as this is a sort of detoxing mask, I am expecting to breakout as my skin tries to regain some balance while clearing out the junk. I am prepared for this, so heads up to everyone else who wants to try this mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use this over a school break during a staycation, just in case you break out a little afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, my three little packets came with this super cute little zipper bag. It&#x27;s white with orange and green floral print, not super cheaply made, but not super strong either. I use it to store my extra packets and some makeup. Let&#x27;s be honest though, you can never have too many makeup bags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this mask is amazing. I&#x27;m going to shell out the $44 and get the big tub once I run out of my packets. It&#x27;s really, really worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sweet to yourself!</li>
