<li> This is a product you can use on frizzy curls that are hard to manage.....and use it whether you want to blow the curls straight or wear the curls curly.  </li>
<li> Have given up all my other ones and only been using this.  </li>
<li> It continues to make my hair easier to manage once my hair is dry.  </li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a residue or weigh my hair down.  </li>
<li> I found it here for half what she said it costs.</li>
<li> I just wish the price was a little bit lower because I do what to keep purchasing this item.</li>
<li> After using product as directed, it left my hair feeling dirty (although I just washed) dry, with a straw like texure.</li>
<li> I have below-the-waist length, thick hair.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for at least 20 years &amp; haven&#x27;t gotten tired of it yet.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately it did not work for me.</li>

    <li> Great leave-in for my 4a-c hair.</li>
    <li> Like ve this product. First tried because my stylist recommended and is great.</li>
    <li> I actually don&#x27;t remember :)</li>
    <li> I bought this product, It&#x27;s a 10 leave-in plus Keratin, for $40 for a 10 oz bottle from a hair salon.....and it was worth every penny!! I was thrilled to find this product on Amazon, and for a better price.  This is a product you can use on frizzy curls that are hard to manage.....and use it whether you want to blow the curls straight or wear the curls curly.  It softens, hydrates, adds shine, detangles, addresses the frizz, just makes the hair look and feel better than before.  It&#x27;s a great product, I&#x27;ve used every product out there. I&#x27;ve been battling the frizz and curls for over 30 yrs, and at age 42, this is the nicest product I&#x27;ve tried.  I am giving it to my daughter who&#x27;s 12 and hates dealing w/the curls, this will help her manage her curls better....this product will not dissapoint.</li>
    <li> I swear by this stuff. it is such a great product and does wonders. its like magic. im almost out and about to reorder.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It makes my hair feel healthy, even though I shampoo every day.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser uses this on my hair and it smells wonderful! I found it here for half what she said it costs. Got a two pack for myself and my daughters.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. I love how it brings out my natural curls and it is amazing at detangling hair after showering. One thing I don&#x27;t like is that it makes my hair get oily at my roots about a day faster than it normally would, so I just try not to apply it near the top.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Great price!</li>
    <li> It did meet my expectations. I just wish the price was a little bit lower because I do what to keep purchasing this item.</li>
    <li> Really like this product.  Have given up all my other ones and only been using this.  Makes my hair so soft.</li>

    <li> \\&quot;It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Leave-In Plus Keratin 4oz. Pack of 2\\&quot; IS definitely a MIRACLE!!! After shampooing my hair, I spray \\&quot;It&#x27;s a 10\\&quot; into my hair and comb. The tangles come out easier and without much effort. I have color on my hair and this product helps to untangle it easier also. The value of buying this product from Amazon, helps in my pocketbook also! I wouldn&#x27;t buy \\&quot;It&#x27;s a 10\\&quot; from anyone or anywhere else!!!</li>
    <li> This product is the best I have ever purchased</li>
    <li> I bought this after completely falling in love with the original Perfect 10 Leave-In product. I have relaxed hair which I heard keratin is good for, so I figured this would be even better.

    <li> I enjoy the 10 Miracle products which helps my bleach and over process hair.  I will continue to purchase these products via Amazon.  Thank you</li>
    <li> After reading many great reviews on this product I made a purchase. Unfortunately it did not work for me. My hair is naturally wavy/curly, but I like to straighten it, so thought this wold be the perfect product as it claims to do many things . After using product as directed, it left my hair feeling dirty (although I just washed) dry, with a straw like texure. Normally after I blowdry/Iron my hair it&#x27;s very soft. Guess this just isn&#x27;t the product for me.</li>
