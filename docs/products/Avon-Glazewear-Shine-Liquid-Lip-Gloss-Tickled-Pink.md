      <li>I love this lip gloss!!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not that good of quality</li>
      <li>I liked the fact that I could order my favorite shade of gloss by avon online and not be hassled to sale Avon.</li>
      <li>the color farthest to the right is my favorite!!</li>

      <li>I know that in the description it says thats only one of them, the first one, but remove that f#$% photo that shows 4 of them</li>
      <li>The seller even added a small sample of primer with my shipment. :-)</li>
      <li>Got here early, looks just like the color online.</li>
      <li>Just know that you will receive the gloss in the pic to the far left.  </li>
      <li>apparently Reading is fundamental.</li>
      <li>i color barely showed on my lips</li>
      <li>so it found a new home with some one who can  wear  pink in all</li>

<li> It is long lasting as well.</li>
<li> Its not bad but not great either.</li>
<li> but it is not worth my effort to send back.  </li>
<li> But the one I received is the pink Avon one.</li>
<li> and I&#x27;ve used several dept store glosses, but I use this one everyday on myself and have for four yrs.</li>
<li> I have other lip gloss and it has lasted for months.  </li>
<li> Not worth the money</li>
<li> Product was sticky and went on in clumps like it had been lying around for a while and dried up in the bottle</li>
<li> I just opened the package and the Lip Gloss is all dried up.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s not too heavy and thick like some other brands I&#x27;ve used.</li>
<li> hard to apply.  </li>
<li> Once burnt twice shy</li>
<li> Wrong shade...</li>
<li> Just disappointed that they have this picture</li>
<li> but I am very disappointed with this product.</li>

    <li> I know that in the description it says thats only one of them, the first one, but remove that f#$% photo that shows 4 of them&lt;br /&gt;Delivered on time and in perfect conditions.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend It but be advice that its only one</li>
    <li> It was alright..the best part was the samples! Wrong shade...I should have really read the fine print. Oh well, it is Avon.</li>
    <li> I love this lip gloss!! It works great! It&#x27;s the leftmost one on the picture, and the picture looks exactly like it!</li>
    <li> I just opened the package and the Lip Gloss is all dried up.  I have other lip gloss and it has lasted for months.  I like Avon products but I am very disappointed with this product.</li>

    <li> I love this color. It makes your lips shiny and beautiful. I liked the fact that I could order my favorite shade of gloss by avon online and not be hassled to sale Avon. I&#x27;m a makeup artist and I&#x27;ve used several dept store glosses, but I use this one everyday on myself and have for four yrs. Highly recommend this gloss. This type of gloss comes in different shades if you&#x27;re not a pink person, but I have used it on clients of different ethnicity and it always makes the lipid looks beautiful and juicy. Highly recommend!! The seller even added a small sample of primer with my shipment. :-)</li>

    <li> i got it and it worked great!! the color farthest to the right is my favorite!! It is long lasting as well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Ok, nice color, as I expected.</li>
    <li> Thick not sticky good color gloss. But you just get one not all of them shown in the pic. I like it and use it a lot.</li>
    <li> I thought it would come like the picture said but it only came with one still a very cute color tho</li>
    <li> excelente producto llego a la fecha esperada y en buenas condiciones todo el proceso fue muy rapido y sencillo gracias</li>
    <li> i thought they were going to bring me a whole set like on the picture. when i got the package, it turned out that they only gave me to medium seized tubes and they were the same color! i color barely showed on my lips</li>
    <li> hard to apply.  Product was sticky and went on in clumps like it had been lying around for a while and dried up in the bottle but it is not worth my effort to send back.  Once burnt twice shy</li>
    <li> Just know that you will receive the gloss in the pic to the far left.  Its not bad but not great either.</li>
    <li> I love the color and the way it glides on smoothly.  It&#x27;s not too heavy and thick like some other brands I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> apparently Reading is fundamental. I thought that I was getting all of the glosses pictured , but you only get one.  The gloss is ok, nothing special and of course nothing to order if you are only getting 1</li>
    <li> i thought it was all four as a collection that was sent.  i think i missed that it was only one tube.. funny i ordered two same thing; two different prices..</li>
    <li> Maybe....it was just me but I only got 1? In the picture there was 4? Show what comes with the product will help....it&#x27;s not that good of quality either it&#x27;s sticky more sticky then usual lip glosses.</li>
    <li> got my lip gloss! it wasnt the color i exactly have been looking for BUT! along with it i got 4 different colored samle lip glosses in which i fount the PERFECT SHADE OF PINK, also i got a bunch of free samples of perfumes and facial cosmetics which i found out work GREAT...I WILL DEFINITELY be buying again from this user</li>
    <li> When i ordered this i was expecting to get all 5 tubes for that price but you only get one. It is an Okay quality but it has no flavor, no smell, and you can easily find a better quality lipgloss at any grocery store for less. Not worth the money</li>
    <li> it  was tested on my skin on hand and some one said not  me . so it found a new home with some one who can  wear  pink in all it was  agood  product  just not my color.</li>
    <li> Received item in the time promised. The reason for four stars instead of five, is the picture of item shows four lip gloss. I thought that was what I was getting. I did read after I received the lip gloss and it stated one lip gloss. I think it was both our fault. It was their fault for showing a picture more than one lip gloss and my fault for not reading the description.</li>
    <li> I thought it was going to come as a set. But the one I received is the pink Avon one. Just disappointed that they have this picture and you only get one product</li>
