      <li>Great colors and fantastic shading with Luminess Air.</li>
      <li>Nice kit.</li>
      <li>Today, my skin is peeling and flaking off, which is a slightly more attractive look than the horror hag make up job that Luminesse was able to deliver.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>Purchased this product many years ago when it came out.</li>
      <li>This item I received had great air flow and works very well.</li>
      <li>It makes it look SO MUCH better.</li>
      <li>Just love mine.</li>
      <li>I think if I keep playing with it, it will look much better than it already does.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love the product however</li>

      <li>Thank you Marilyn for providing great customer service and going above and beyond the call of duty.</li>
      <li>and she didn&#x27;t get free shipping like she was supposed.</li>
      <li>One would have been a good match for Wednesday Adams, and the other would be a nice fit for Malibu Barbie, or just about any person who lived with no sunscreen on a deserted island with no shade for about 35 years.</li>
      <li>This product really works!!!</li>
      <li>When it arrived I was excited to try it out.</li>
      <li>I purchased  this luminescent air in Jan, but saved it to use for special occasions.</li>
      <li>The airbrush itself was ok, all made of stainless steel.</li>
      <li>on Amazon I paid around $100 and it was worth it.  </li>
      <li>Not even worth the amount of money they are charging.</li>
      <li>That is where the fun</li>
      <li>It causes all of the hair on your face to stand up, and it settles right into your wrinkles.</li>
      <li>But hey 5 minutes to look younger and get compliments is sure worth the effort.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worth what I paid for it, but it did make applying foundation so much easier.</li>
      <li>First they charge you 20 bucks non refundable</li>
      <li>It dripped foundation all over at first</li>
      <li>What I should have done: purchased a regular airbrush and just add water to my favorite foundations.</li>
      <li>Learning curve was not difficult.  </li>
      <li>I was able to blend the two and come up with something that looked close enough to my skin tone.</li>
      <li>I have used and loved Dinair in the past, and after this nightmare experience bought myself a Dinair system.</li>
      <li>wish I could easily order some of the makeups individually though as I ran out of some.</li>
      <li>I will recommend any one who wants to look like a million bucks any day.</li>
      <li>Also, the makeup feels sticky after applying and never fully dries, causing you to really want to touch it.  </li>
      <li>My Luminess Air starter kit was much easier to use than I thought it would be.</li>
      <li>HOWEVER DO NOT ORDER FROM LUMINESS DIRECTLY!!!</li>
      <li>DO NOT ORDER DIRECTLY FROM LUMINESSAIR.COM!!!    </li>
      <li>With easy to follow directions, it didn&#x27;t take long for me to get the hang of this.</li>
      <li>I bought a Luminess Air airbrush system for my girlfriend, and there are SO many hidden costs and fees.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy, fast, and the make up seems to last pretty long.</li>
      <li>Brush and pump seem to be a decent quality.</li>
      <li>I really have to give her kudos for taking the extra time to help me not only figure out a color match for my skin tone, she also made me feel very special and renewed my excitement about the products.  </li>
      <li>I read a little more and the manual said to mix the two foundation colors in order to achieve the desired color.</li>
      <li>and it was obviously not new as it had numerous scratches on the top</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin, and my skin is softer with no breakouts.</li>
      <li>I am a 36 year old woman who doesn&#x27;t wear foundation ever because I can never find a foundation light enough with having red hair.  </li>
      <li>I will try it a few more times with different moisturizers and primers in an attempt to combat the melt factor before I return it, but it certainly won&#x27;t be at a time when other people have to see me (which is pretty much never), and overall I&#x27;m not optimistic...</li>
      <li>Luminesse make up clearly has something off about it.</li>
      <li>People have commented on how refreshed and young I look.  </li>
      <li>Since, the pump is so cheap; it applies unevenly.</li>
      <li>and she doesn&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I could not remove that horror hag make up fast enough.</li>
      <li>They are scam artists and lied about their complete 30 day trial and refund.</li>
      <li>Low, low one-time cost of $29.99 + $10.00 supply upgrade --just $39.99 for the complete LuminessAir system and bonus gifts.  </li>
      <li>I had an issue with my original order regarding matching my skin tone to the products I had received, which left me a little frustrated until I encountered an exceptional representative named Marilyn.</li>

<li> I had an issue with my original order regarding matching my skin tone to the products I had received, which left me a little frustrated until I encountered an exceptional representative named Marilyn.</li>
<li> I do not have sensitive skin, and have used other brands of airbrush foundation plenty of times without having the napalm-like burning results.</li>
<li> However, the first time I wore it, I had to make an emergency trip to the drugstore because it began to melt off of my nose after I had already left the house for an evening event, which was quite embarrassing to say the least.</li>
<li> Next, I had strange charges on my account that I did not receive a notification about.</li>
<li> THEY&#x27;RE taking advantage of customers by BATING them with LOW purchase offers and mentioning RECURRING, EXORBITANT equipment costs in the small print.  </li>
<li> Now you cannot see my dark circles around my eyes or red spots on my face.</li>
<li> DO NOT BECOME A VICTIM OF SCAM</li>
<li> It was actually less in price than the Luminesse, and Dinair has an ACTUAL guarantee.</li>
<li> guess if you have a great complexion with non-oily skin, and if you have a lot of time, patience, and money, this product could work for you, but it&#x27;s terrible for me.  </li>
<li> It looked so thick and heavy and felt very greasy.</li>
<li> Works as expected.</li>
<li> It took two practice tries to figure it out.</li>
<li> The tubing provided was really flimsy thin plastic as well.</li>
<li> I would not recommend  this product sorry I bought it and wish I would of tried it right away and returned it.</li>
<li> The tip is to stop every few seconds and blot your face with a piece of toilet paper.</li>
<li> A little of the bronzer/blush goes a LONG way.</li>
<li> First, my husband noticed that my pores were showing through the product, and then when I touched it to try and fix the problem, it made it so much worse!</li>
<li> It is not worth the money.</li>
<li> It takes me 5 minutes to put my makeup on, but with practice it should take less time.</li>
<li> Now our faces are dry and flakey because we had to take it off because it burned and it was so hard to take when it started to burn</li>
<li> It was hard to do at first without making my face look really weird.</li>
<li> A complete waste of money!!!!</li>
<li> Maybe 2-3 drops for one coat on 1/4 of your face, but unfortunately, you need multiple coats to have any coverage at all, so it is less than economical.&lt;br</li>
<li> The notification that you have incurred this monthly fee is hidden and hard to spot in the order process.</li>
<li> and as I recall it was missing a part!</li>
<li> The airbrush itself is poorly made and the make up is basically watered down.</li>
</ol>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Learning curve was not difficult.  Works great!</li>
    <li> Luminess Air will stick you with a monthly recurring charge (their monthly club membership) that is difficult to stop and impossible to reverse charges (even on credit cards). The notification that you have incurred this monthly fee is hidden and hard to spot in the order process. DO NOT PURCHASE.</li>
    <li> A complete waste of money!!!!</li>
    <li> Once you get use to it, it is wonderful. Just love mine. Great colors and fantastic shading with Luminess Air.</li>
    <li> Not a bad machine at all! The makeup tends to get clogged easily and you have to clean it often for optimal performance but it is a great buy!</li>
    <li> Never again! This is my second system and it broke 30 days into use and purchase. I have reached out to the company 6x and still no one has reached back!!!</li>
    <li> Great; need the perfect shade.</li>
    <li> I got one of these as a deal on some deal site. When it arrived I was excited to try it out. That is where the fun ended.&lt;br /&gt;The machine is made out of plastic. Not even good plastic. The airbrush itself was ok, all made of stainless steel. The tubing provided was really flimsy thin plastic as well. I cannot see how this would hold up any longer than 2 weeks before cracking and breaking.&lt;br /&gt;The actual make up colors are like no colors any living human being would actually have for skin tones. I had chosen the &amp;#34;fair&amp;#34; shades, and two colors arrived. One would have been a good match for Wednesday Adams, and the other would be a nice fit for Malibu Barbie, or just about any person who lived with no sunscreen on a deserted island with no shade for about 35 years. That is quite a range! I read a little more and the manual said to mix the two foundation colors in order to achieve the desired color. I was able to blend the two and come up with something that looked close enough to my skin tone. Applying the make up was simple enough, you point and spray. This is where the bad part comes in....&lt;br /&gt;It looks terrible on. I might as well have used Spackle. It looked so thick and heavy and felt very greasy. It had the ability to highlight fine lines that I did not know were there. I looked like a horror movie hag.&lt;br /&gt;Then, the burning started. By burning I mean my face felt like it had been sandblasted and then dipped in acid. It burned so bad I was in tears as I tried to wash that stuff off. I could not remove that horror hag make up fast enough. When I got it all off, my skin continued to burn horribly for the next 5 hours. Today, my skin is peeling and flaking off, which is a slightly more attractive look than the horror hag make up job that Luminesse was able to deliver.&lt;br /&gt;The Luminesse make up clearly has something off about it. I do not have sensitive skin, and have used other brands of airbrush foundation plenty of times without having the napalm-like burning results. I have used and loved Dinair in the past, and after this nightmare experience bought myself a Dinair system. It was actually less in price than the Luminesse, and Dinair has an ACTUAL guarantee. If you want to try airbrushing your make up, DO NOT use a Luminesse.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the product however the blush, bronzer and primer all had cuts it the neck of the bottle and it all leaked out.</li>
    <li> I called Luminess and they wanted $300 for this product.  I would not pay $300 but on Amazon I paid around $100 and it was worth it.  I like it a lot.  It&#x27;s easy, fast, and the make up seems to last pretty long. I am a 36 year old woman who doesn&#x27;t wear foundation ever because I can never find a foundation light enough with having red hair.  The lightest shade was perfect for me.  I like this product, the only downfall I would say is if you are looking for it to make pores look smaller, I don&#x27;t believe it does that.  But over all I think it is a good product, I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> This product is junk. Not even worth the amount of money they are charging. If I could give it a zero I would. First they charge you 20 bucks non refundable and then I get it and the make up is cakey and thick and it made my skin break out so bad. Within the week I returned it and they are suppose to give you your 60 bucks back but what did I get 35 back WTF man they are some scam artists. Do not buy its not what its cracked up to be.</li>
    <li> Being in my 60s, I thought I would give this a try. Well guess what? This product really works!!! People have commented on how refreshed and young I look.  Could it be, I don&#x27;t look like I have makeup on, just a refresh youthful look? Now you cannot see my dark circles around my eyes or red spots on my face. I have very sensitive skin, and my skin is softer with no breakouts. I am sold on this product. However it does take time and patience using the airbrush. I must admit on a couple attempts I had to wash my face and start over. It takes me 5 minutes to put my makeup on, but with practice it should take less time. But hey 5 minutes to look younger and get compliments is sure worth the effort.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed because the makeup was too dark for my skin tone.</li>
    <li> There is a learning curve.</li>
    <li> DO NOT ORDER DIRECTLY FROM LUMINESSAIR.COM!!!    THEY&#x27;RE taking advantage of customers by BATING them with LOW purchase offers and mentioning RECURRING, EXORBITANT equipment costs in the small print.  SERIOUSLY!!!    Low, low one-time cost of $29.99 + $10.00 supply upgrade --just $39.99 for the complete LuminessAir system and bonus gifts.  Oh, and \\&quot;by the way, we&#x27;ll be charging you $69.99 each month for 5 months!\\&quot; That&#x27;s a SIGNIFICANT equipment purchase price of $349.95 that should NEVER be mentioned by a legitimate business in the fine print!    SHAME ON THEM and all their employees for duping customers!!! I will not hesitate to share their business practices across the internet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted one of these things, and I finally had a chance to purchase. It was hard to do at first without making my face look really weird. The tip is to stop every few seconds and blot your face with a piece of toilet paper. It makes it look SO MUCH better. I think if I keep playing with it, it will look much better than it already does. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worth what I paid for it, but it did make applying foundation so much easier. Just a word of advice. A little of the bronzer/blush goes a LONG way.</li>
    <li> The parts do not connect.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work sent it back</li>
    <li> Purchased this product many years ago when it came out. The airbrush itself is poorly made and the make up is basically watered down. Since, the pump is so cheap; it applies unevenly. What I should have done: purchased a regular airbrush and just add water to my favorite foundations. Still cheaper than this awful stuff!</li>
    <li> My wife uses it and likes it.  HOWEVER DO NOT ORDER FROM LUMINESS DIRECTLY!!! THEY SOMEHOW FORGET TO QUIT CHARGING YOUR CARD.</li>
    <li> I was concerned about the ease of use  and skin irritation after reading the reviews, but I thought I&#x27;d try it anyway. I found it very easy to use, easily matched my skin tone and has caused no skin irritation. It took two practice tries to figure it out. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks, I&#x27;ve found a routine and I am very pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> I had an issue with my original order regarding matching my skin tone to the products I had received, which left me a little frustrated until I encountered an exceptional representative named Marilyn. I really have to give her kudos for taking the extra time to help me not only figure out a color match for my skin tone, she also made me feel very special and renewed my excitement about the products.  Thank you Marilyn for providing great customer service and going above and beyond the call of duty.</li>
    <li> Bought the luminess air system and returned it after only 4 days of use because I was dissatisfied with service and was not refunded the total amount I paid for. They are scam artists and lied about their complete 30 day trial and refund. Beware if you buy from Luminess Air.</li>
    <li> Had to be returned because it did not work. Very disappointed as it said it was new and it was obviously not new as it had numerous scratches on the top and as I recall it was missing a part!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s terrible my friend and I tried and she said her face burned and she doesn&#x27;t have sensitive skin. About 20 minutes my face burns and It was horrible. We went to return 2 days after we got it and we didn&#x27;t get a refund and then my sister told me that when she bought it it fell apart and the foundation was lighter and she freaked me out because she looks like ghost. Don&#x27;t buy it there scamming you my sister never got her refund and she didn&#x27;t get free shipping like she was supposed. Now our faces are dry and flakey because we had to take it off because it burned and it was so hard to take when it started to burn we tried to take it off but it was so greasy and it like attached to our skin. Why does every cosmetic company have to suck?</li>
    <li> Love this, great price as compared to luminess site.</li>
    <li> this is the best thing I have bought for myself in a long time.I have been looking on the tv and seeing how it works and I decide to check on amazon and oh boy it was there.I had to get me one and it works wonderful as seen on tv.I will recommend any one who wants to look like a million bucks any day.</li>
    <li> Amazing! My Luminess Air starter kit was much easier to use than I thought it would be. With easy to follow directions, it didn&#x27;t take long for me to get the hang of this. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on how great I look. I know what I&#x27;ll be giving out for X-Mas this year to my girlfriends.</li>
    <li> Recommend for all of my friends.  Great product.  Husband ordered it for me and I love it.  Plan on buying for gifts.</li>
    <li> Nice kit. wish I could easily order some of the makeups individually though as I ran out of some. Real disappointment because I can&#x27;t find the exact replacement. Brush and pump seem to be a decent quality. Works as expected.</li>
    <li> I purchased  this luminescent air in Jan, but saved it to use for special occasions. I watched the CD which made it seem so simple. It dripped foundation all over at first and then when it did start to mist there was no coverage even though it used the foundation. I would not recommend  this product sorry I bought it and wish I would of tried it right away and returned it.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to try this product when I received it for Christmas this year. However, the first time I wore it, I had to make an emergency trip to the drugstore because it began to melt off of my nose after I had already left the house for an evening event, which was quite embarrassing to say the least. First, my husband noticed that my pores were showing through the product, and then when I touched it to try and fix the problem, it made it so much worse! I essentially had to remove it from my nose and put a different product in it&#x27;s place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t touch it at all, because it doesn&#x27;t blend, but rather it comes off in splotches and you have to start all over. Also, the makeup feels sticky after applying and never fully dries, causing you to really want to touch it.  Powder doesn&#x27;t work over it so eye makeup is made more difficult too.  The application process is lengthy, especially if you are a perfectionist.  It causes all of the hair on your face to stand up, and it settles right into your wrinkles. And 2-3 drops is a lie. Maybe 2-3 drops for one coat on 1/4 of your face, but unfortunately, you need multiple coats to have any coverage at all, so it is less than economical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess if you have a great complexion with non-oily skin, and if you have a lot of time, patience, and money, this product could work for you, but it&#x27;s terrible for me.  I will try it a few more times with different moisturizers and primers in an attempt to combat the melt factor before I return it, but it certainly won&#x27;t be at a time when other people have to see me (which is pretty much never), and overall I&#x27;m not optimistic...</li>
    <li> Do not purchase from Luminess Air! They are scam artists! I bought a Luminess Air airbrush system for my girlfriend, and there are SO many hidden costs and fees. The first pump I received did not work, and it looked and felt VERY cheap, and is made in China! It is not worth the money. Next, I had strange charges on my account that I did not receive a notification about. It turns out that when you buy a product, you are automatically signing up for a $45.06 a month membership! I called the company to cancel the membership, and it was very difficult to do. DO NOT BECOME A VICTIM OF SCAM LIKE I DID!</li>
    <li> This item I received had great air flow and works very well. I am very pleased with this item.</li>
