      <li>I love this product.</li>

      <li>When I switched to amazon I got much more of a deal   for the price.  </li>
      <li>It cleans all the follicles of the hair, and keeps it healthy, and it stops thinning and falling out.  </li>
      <li>and I can tell that my hair has transformed into healthy hair.  </li>
      <li>Love the product.  </li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;Buying in the large container is a good savings</li>
      <li>The conditioner is fine.  </li>
      <li>the best hair care there is my hair has gotten so much stronger and healthur and its actually growing my hair</li>
      <li>Because I use so much more of the conditioner than the shampoo, being able to buy a good quantity is useful and brings the price down.</li>

      <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased a gallon that was &amp;#34;cut&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>Thank you so much!</li>
      <li>I have a large family and this is just what I need to save money.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery.</li>
      <li>I bought a 6.3 oz bottle retail for almost as much as this gallon cost</li>
      <li>Saved a REAL lot of money over store price.</li>
      <li>and it was completely sealed and is the real deal.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s thin and fine - Nioxin is easy on my color and helps my hair seem stronger and thicker.</li>
      <li>I can use the large jug to refill into smaller ones for the two bathrooms with showers.</li>
      <li>and I use it for my sensitive scalp.  </li>
      <li>It was full and not watered down.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product from this vendor as compared to local beauty supply stores!</li>

    <li> Everything fulfilled as described.</li>
    <li> It works well on a person with a thin hair.</li>
    <li> the best hair care there is my hair has gotten so much stronger and healthur and its actually growing my hair never grows becasue i straighten it all the time.</li>
    <li> The conditioner is fine.  I seem to be allergic to regular shampoos and conditioners,  My head does not itch and my hair does not fall out when usihg Nioxin.  However, I had, again, thought I was purchasing shampoo and was annoyed to find I had ordered conditioner.  The description on these is poor.  They should use the words shampoo and conditioner in the heading.</li>
    <li> Great product is affordable in this size. No more trips for re-supply.</li>
    <li> This is a outstanding product and the price is excellent. I highly recommend this product from this vendor as compared to local beauty supply stores!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using nioxin cleanser for at least 9 years.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased a gallon that was &amp;#34;cut&amp;#34;.  It is NOT pure Nioxin cleanser.  It has some additive that smells awful.  I&#x27;ll never buy from this company again!</li>
    <li> Love the price &amp; having a gallon on hand.</li>
    <li> this is a great product.  my hair dresser recommended that I buy it.  I&#x27;ve been using for over 3 years and I can tell that my hair has transformed into healthy hair.  You must buy the shampoo with this and the leave in treatment.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner and am glad to be able to get it in the gallon size!</li>
    <li> Just as described....&lt;br /&gt;Quick delivery.</li>
    <li> You need to leave this conditioner on your scalp for 3-5 minutes.  You can feel it working...feels like a peppermint tingle.  I shut off the shower and wait the 5 minutes.  It cleans all the follicles of the hair, and keeps it healthy, and it stops thinning and falling out.  Best product out there for keeping hair healthy...and just keeping hair!!!</li>
    <li> Takes a long time but has helped my hair a lot</li>
    <li> Great product.  Will order again</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Great price.</li>
    <li> Good product and great price thank you</li>

    <li> great hair care prodct</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the product and will definitely purchase it again when needed.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. My daughter uses it for her eczema and I use it for my sensitive scalp.  Leaves the scalp feeling refreshed and smells clean.</li>
    <li> Saved a REAL lot of money over store price. I bought a 6.3 oz bottle retail for almost as much as this gallon cost</li>
