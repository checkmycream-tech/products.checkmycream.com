### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This product works best if you work it all through each section of your hair.</li>
      <li>and they came out perfect, no flaky residue</li>
      <li>Works great for my wavy hair!</li>
      <li>Beautiful Curls</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>I will add that I also entered a five-star review for a Kinky Curly product - which worked great on the curls, but did nothing for the breakage.  </li>
      <li>My curls look great.  </li>
      <li>this worked great with a blowdryer.  </li>
      <li>The ingredients are great and I feel good about this company.</li>
      <li>This gel is light, smells gorgeous and feels awesome!</li>
      <li>The surprising liquidity ensures that moisture penetrates through the hairshaft to the cortex.  </li>
      <li>I just run my fingers through it a bit and its gorgeous.</li>
      <li>If I wash my hair in the morning, I just put it on and style my hair, and my hair is good.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite in the Beautiful Curls products.  </li>
      <li>Thanks for a great product, from a great company!</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
      <li>nice improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very easy, which is my preference.  </li>
      <li>So far, after a week of use, I&#x27;m impressed.  </li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>LOVE IT.</li>
      <li>But I think I&#x27;m going to be very happy teaming up the shampoo with another conditioner, the gel with a different shampoo/conditioner line etc...  </li>
      <li>Even better than devacurl.</li>
      <li>But this one is my favorite now.</li>
      <li>Also, make sure to use it alone on your hair.</li>
      <li>I like the tube better, so</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s surpisingly a more liquid texture</li>
      <li>So glad I found it.</li>
      <li>Does create a bit of a crunchy curl, though can be smoothed out easily.</li>
      <li>At that point, if there&#x27;s a crunchiness, I just scrunch it easily with my fingers.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried Deva and Bumble and Bumble, but always find my way back to Beautiful Curls.</li>
      <li>Great product-hard to find-always sold out locally.</li>
      <li>apply a quarter-size dab to my hair, run a wide-toothed comb through it to distribute the product, then lightly scrunch with a microfiber towel.</li>
      <li>After a month of using it I&#x27;ve noticed much less breakage, my hair is healthier shinier - super impressed.</li>
      <li>I was hoping to find something I am familiar with.</li>
      <li>Prior to this I would use mousse and a gel to get a good curl.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really a cream/gel, and I love its consistency.</li>
      <li>and even went through the transition and trauma of growing out a relaxer (my hair is a bit below shoulder length so was rocking curls on the top, straight on the bottom for a bit).  </li>
      <li>My hair is then soft and nicely defined.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very gentle and easy to use.</li>
      <li>This product helps the curls tremendously.  </li>
      <li>I like the fact it does not make your hair hard, and it really defines my curls perfectly.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing and never feels gritty on your hair.</li>
      <li>As an aside, I am proud to be addicted to a fair trade product with natural, vegan, biodegradable ingredients.  </li>
      <li>I find that I&#x27;m better able to get decent second- or even third-day hair using this product.</li>
      <li>Also, knowing that I am supporting community empowerment projects in Togo, West Africa is a far better peripheral feeling than giving my dollar votes to mega conglomerates.  </li>
      <li>have not felt the need to add any other gel for extra hold, but I&#x27;m sure that you could do so successfully.</li>
      <li>On slightly damp hair, over Devachan One condition I put in about 3 teaspoons throughout my hair and I am frizz free with nicely put together curls.  </li>
      <li>I would still like more length, but I&#x27;m confident I will have to cut my hair less because this is working so well.  </li>
      <li>I use a chemical sensitive one from another company for a bit more hold (my fine hair goes limp easily) and that&#x27;s it!  </li>
      <li>Also it combs out easily at night after a day of controlled waves/curls and leaves my hair soft and wavy.  </li>
      <li>First it did not come in a jar but a tube.  </li>
      <li>This is the first product that did what I wanted on the first try.  </li>
      <li>I sometimes blowdry my hair, not totally straight, but just give it some tension at the bottom and warm setting to lengthen the curl and</li>
      <li>It dries pretty fast too.</li>
      <li>I use it when get out of the shower and it has really helped my dry hair look better.</li>
      <li>I have been buying and using this gel for almost a whole year, and it still makes my hair softer and healthier than it&#x27;s ever been.</li>
      <li>I bought the whole line and while I feel like I do like each product (shampoo, leave-in conditioner and gel)</li>
      <li>Much prefer this to the cream they also sell.</li>
      <li>It controls frizz very well and really does help to define curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The miraculous by-product is that the handfuls of broken hair that used to be on the shower floor are now still on my head, happily curling.  </li>
      <li>then with just a dab of this stuff, and maybe some of the spray from the same company, I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised by the manageable, stylish look</li>
      <li>It has a thinner consistency than other gels and creams, but I find that it&#x27;s more workable.</li>
      <li>Out of all three products, this gel is my favorite - hands down.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>It defines my Natural curls nicely but it will make your hair VERY STIFF.</li>
      <li>But since I&#x27;ve been in a very dry climate this is the only product that makes me love my hair again.</li>
      <li>The only problem is that I was looking for this exact packaging but the product came in a tube..............new packaging that I do NOt like.  </li>
      <li>I recently went surfing in Costa Rica and the sun and salt made my hair a hot mess, but using this afterward each day was a true revival.  </li>
      <li>: I like this product so much that I have posted this review on several sites.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a soft hold.</li>
      <li>The only thing you have to consider is how much product you put in your hair.  </li>
      <li>but it really gives me a solid hold.  </li>
      <li>The gel left my hair white and full of white beads!</li>
      <li>It works but the bottle is so small, it would take 3 more bottles to really last you a month.</li>
      <li>When I read the back it said that it works for natural styling.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve come to like that and really need to use far less product than when I was using gels or mousse.</li>
      <li>and it took a few trials to get the right amount,</li>
      <li>This slightly runny gel works well for me as a refresher or first day product.  </li>
      <li>(heavy heavy and actually makes my hair a bit more frizzy).  </li>
      <li>It does dry a touch stiff, but a quick \\&quot;smoosh\\&quot; will do the trick.</li>
      <li>I have moderately curly hair (type 3) and avoided shea butter for years, suspecting it would be too dense and weigh down my curls too much.  </li>
      <li>No residue, no sticky, stiff curls, just a very natural soft look.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I purchased this from Sprouts by accident. I was hoping to find something I am familiar with. When I read the back it said that it works for natural styling. So anyway I did a straw curl set and they came out perfect, no flaky residue and it gave it body and shine. It dries pretty fast too. But I don&#x27;t know if its for everyone.</li>
    <li> This slightly runny gel works well for me as a refresher or first day product.  The ingredients are great and I feel good about this company.</li>
    <li> I am Middle Eastern and have 3B and 3C curly hair. This product works best if you work it all through each section of your hair. I have been buying and using this gel for almost a whole year, and it still makes my hair softer and healthier than it&#x27;s ever been. So glad I found it. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I like the curls this creates, sans a bunch of chemicals in the product. Does create a bit of a crunchy curl, though can be smoothed out easily.</li>
    <li> Great product-hard to find-always sold out locally. It&#x27;s one of the few products that actually does what it says! Don&#x27;t delay in trying it!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite in the Beautiful Curls products.  I like the fact it does not make your hair hard, and it really defines my curls perfectly.  I would recommend this product for the ladies that have type 3b curly hair like myself.</li>
    <li> Works great for my wavy hair!</li>
    <li> I have extremely thick hair -- people tend to give me compliments when it&#x27;s WET because the volume is decreased. As I&#x27;ve aged the waves have started straightening out. Of course I used to roll my hair on giant rollers and try to straighten it but now that it&#x27;s trying to straighten itself, I want the waves back!  This stuff does the trick -- and just a tiny bit, too!  Also it combs out easily at night after a day of controlled waves/curls and leaves my hair soft and wavy.  This is what I&#x27;ve been looking for forever! I should buy a case of it while they still make it!</li>
    <li> Yes it does come in a tube and it is weirdly watery. But since I&#x27;ve been in a very dry climate this is the only product that makes me love my hair again. It dries a little crunchy--I just run my fingers through it a bit and its gorgeous. What a find! Even better than devacurl.</li>
    <li> I have moderately curly hair (type 3) and avoided shea butter for years, suspecting it would be too dense and weigh down my curls too much.  However, the grayer I&#x27;ve gotten, the dryer my hair has become - so I took the plunge.  Long story short - I love this stuff!  My curls look great.  The miraculous by-product is that the handfuls of broken hair that used to be on the shower floor are now still on my head, happily curling.  Breakage is down by several hundred percent, conservatively.  I will add that I also entered a five-star review for a Kinky Curly product - which worked great on the curls, but did nothing for the breakage.  So if I could give this one a ten-star review, I would.  Great product.</li>
    <li> This product helps the curls tremendously.  It is not greasy.  The only problem is that I was looking for this exact packaging but the product came in a tube..............new packaging that I do NOt like.  I have very long hair and I need to set the jar on a table while I&#x27;m manipulating my hair.  The tube makes a mess.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended this to me.  She uses on all hair types.  I use it when get out of the shower and it has really helped my dry hair look better.</li>
    <li> This is an unsung hero in the world of curly girl products. I&#x27;ve used a zillion curl defining creams and gels. I like several. But this one is my favorite now. It&#x27;s really a cream/gel, and I love its consistency. A little bit goes a long way. It controls frizz very well and really does help to define curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply a quarter-size dab to my hair, run a wide-toothed comb through it to distribute the product, then lightly scrunch with a microfiber towel. I then don&#x27;t touch my hair until it&#x27;s dry. At that point, if there&#x27;s a crunchiness, I just scrunch it easily with my fingers. My hair is then soft and nicely defined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not felt the need to add any other gel for extra hold, but I&#x27;m sure that you could do so successfully. I find that I&#x27;m better able to get decent second- or even third-day hair using this product. I hope it is never discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: I like this product so much that I have posted this review on several sites.</li>
    <li> So far, after a week of use, I&#x27;m impressed.  I didn&#x27;t now what to expect from a creme gel (never used one before) but it really gives me a solid hold.  Prior to this I would use mousse and a gel to get a good curl.  I don&#x27;t need the mousse with this product.  I bought the whole line and while I feel like I do like each product (shampoo, leave-in conditioner and gel) individually, I don&#x27;t like the feel it gives my hair when I use them all together (heavy heavy and actually makes my hair a bit more frizzy).  But I think I&#x27;m going to be very happy teaming up the shampoo with another conditioner, the gel with a different shampoo/conditioner line etc...  Out of all three products, this gel is my favorite - hands down.</li>
    <li> It defines my Natural curls nicely but it will make your hair VERY STIFF. Also, make sure to use it alone on your hair. I used it after I put on my leave-in and let it air dry for a while. The gel left my hair white and full of white beads! I had to wash my hair and start all over again! I don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll be buying it again.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve ever prayed before bed for a hair miracle, this is it.  I have experimented with approximately a million dollars worth of hair products on this curly head of hair and will now stop my search for the thing that will give me spiritual peace.  I have a tight curl with different textures throughout my hair ranging from a 3a to a 4a and have tried every mouse, hair gel, serum, shampoo, leave-in conditioner etc. and even went through the transition and trauma of growing out a relaxer (my hair is a bit below shoulder length so was rocking curls on the top, straight on the bottom for a bit).  This is the first product that did what I wanted on the first try.  On slightly damp hair, over Devachan One condition I put in about 3 teaspoons throughout my hair and I am frizz free with nicely put together curls.  The surprising liquidity ensures that moisture penetrates through the hairshaft to the cortex.  Instead of thinking of my hair as a trauma to be survived, I am smiling because I don&#x27;t have to think about it during the day anymore, it&#x27;s doing what I&#x27;ve always wanted it to do.  I would still like more length, but I&#x27;m confident I will have to cut my hair less because this is working so well.  I sometimes blowdry my hair, not totally straight, but just give it some tension at the bottom and warm setting to lengthen the curl and this worked great with a blowdryer.  As an aside, I am proud to be addicted to a fair trade product with natural, vegan, biodegradable ingredients.  This is a truly forward thinking, grass roots product.  Also, knowing that I am supporting community empowerment projects in Togo, West Africa is a far better peripheral feeling than giving my dollar votes to mega conglomerates.  The only thing you have to consider is how much product you put in your hair.  Too much made me look like an oil slick and it took a few trials to get the right amount, but once you do, it will be a default keeper.  I recently went surfing in Costa Rica and the sun and salt made my hair a hot mess, but using this afterward each day was a true revival.  So thankful for Alaffia.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I&#x27;ve tried Deva and Bumble and Bumble, but always find my way back to Beautiful Curls. It has a thinner consistency than other gels and creams, but I find that it&#x27;s more workable.</li>
    <li> When I got it home. I found out that it was just a gel. It works but the bottle is so small, it would take 3 more bottles to really last you a month.</li>
    <li> There is nothing else I will use on my curls. This stuff is amazing and never feels gritty on your hair. Much prefer this to the cream they also sell. This gel is light, smells gorgeous and feels awesome!</li>
    <li> LOVE IT. IT DEFINES MY HAIR CURLS AND PROVIDES SHINE TO MY 3C/4A CURLY HAIR. I WILL PURCHASED IT AGAIN.</li>
    <li> This product works well on curly hair, definitely moisturizes and enhances your curl. The only draw back is that the curl will on last one day, you can&#x27;t expect to get 3 or 4 days of curls out of this product b/c it&#x27;s a soft hold. Once you pay on these curls, you&#x27;ll have to wash or wet hair and reapply the product. But, for the defining factor, I give this products 4 Stars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m attempting to shampoo less and my hair loves it.  I often will just brush it in the morning to get any of the light residue from the previous day&#x27;s products (very little) till I look like a clown, then with just a dab of this stuff, and maybe some of the spray from the same company, I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised by the manageable, stylish look I&#x27;m now left with.  No residue, no sticky, stiff curls, just a very natural soft look. I wish they had a hairspray!  I use a chemical sensitive one from another company for a bit more hold (my fine hair goes limp easily) and that&#x27;s it!  Very easy, which is my preference.  I&#x27;ve already wasted too much time fretting and fusing with my hair in my life, I don&#x27;t want to do it anymore! Thanks for a great product, from a great company!</li>
    <li> First it did not come in a jar but a tube.  Secondly it is so watery and not a gel.  It leaks out of the tube.  I will probably not buy again. [[ASIN:B004OX8TK2 Beautiful Curls Curl Defining Gel for Wavy to Curly Hair -- 8 oz]]</li>
    <li> You can skip the leave in conditioner with this stuff. I have medium curls on thick, little bit coarse hair. I have tried EVERYTHING. After a month of using it I&#x27;ve noticed much less breakage, my hair is healthier shinier - super impressed. It does dry a touch stiff, but a quick \\&quot;smoosh\\&quot; will do the trick. It&#x27;s surpisingly a more liquid texture but I&#x27;ve come to like that and really need to use far less product than when I was using gels or mousse. The hold and de-frizzing are amazing - even during a brutally humid NYC summer! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this gel for a couple of years. It used to be in a jar like what&#x27;s shown in the picture. Now it comes in a tube. I like the tube better, so I think it is a nice improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many hair products make me loose lots of hair. This one does not. It&#x27;s very gentle and easy to use. If I wash my hair in the morning, I just put it on and style my hair, and my hair is good. If I wash my hair at night, I just dampen my hair, then apply the gel.</li>
