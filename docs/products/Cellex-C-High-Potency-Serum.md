      <li>Love this product...</li>
      <li>Love love love</li>
      <li>(On top of it, I dab Weleda&#x27;s Skin Food for a dewy complexion.</li>
      <li>I wish more companies did this.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t wait to order more of this</li>
      <li>i enjoyed this product years ago and again now.</li>
      <li>You will pay more, if you buy it from the dermatologist.</li>
      <li>(thought I would create a better way for the product to get in and work).  </li>
      <li>Once it starts to turn a bit more orange, the vitamin C is oxidizing.  </li>
      <li>My skin looks much better, I can see the difference, the skin looks brighter,little tighter.  </li>
      <li>The prescription for retin-A is working so much better in conjunction with Cellex.</li>
      <li>Anyway, my skin actually looks pretty good, but the jowl and chin &#x27;saggies&#x27; have been especially challenging.</li>
      <li>The serum is easily applied; I use nightly after cleansing and about 30 minutes or more before I go to sleep.  </li>
      <li>I love this product because it truly work to improve skin texture, lightens age spots while smoothing fine lines.</li>
      <li>Switched to Skinceuticals for about 6 months but came back to this one; the original, and the best.</li>
      <li>My dry skin now has a healthy glow!!!</li>
      <li>I use this with Hydro B and the two products are fabulous.  </li>
      <li>Both products are available in two strengths.</li>
      <li>So far, so good.  </li>
      <li>As a 50-year old woman who&#x27;s fairly low-maintenance when it comes to skin care, this is a product I decided to stick with.  </li>
      <li>I really notice  the difference when I don&#x27;t use it for a couple of weeks!!!    </li>
      <li>This product was very fresh.  </li>
      <li>To be honest, I had high hopes for this based on all the reviews.</li>
      <li>Perfect amount of hydration without being an oil slick on my face.</li>
      <li>The change to my skin was almost immediate, but after 3 months of consistent use my skin is 90% better.</li>
      <li>My skin looks fantastic and really radiant and healthy.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is important that you do not use more than 3 drops because this is very acidic, it will irritate your skin.</li>
      <li>The product has virtually no scent and is absorbed very quickly by my skin.</li>
      <li>, however I am aging so I was interested in this cream as it had such great results on the website.  </li>
      <li>This product was recommended by a dermatologist because it is made at a molecular level that will penetrate your skin so you get the full affects of the vitamin C.  </li>
      <li>I had not used it for some time due to the price and availability, but I am happy to use it again as I can see and feel the difference in my skin.</li>
      <li>It arrived quickly.  </li>
      <li>Since using Cellex-C, my facial skin has tightened nicely.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 50, and many of my 40 year old friends show stronger signs of aging.  </li>
      <li>You can tell if this product is fresh by the color.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure there are varying degrees of \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot;</li>
      <li>I will probably not buy this again, but will continue to use the rest of the bottle (can&#x27;t hurt, right?)</li>
      <li>This is amazing my skin is clear and smooth and notice a big difference when I don&#x27;t use it.being 57 and looking</li>
      <li>The seller was very fast in answering my questions.  </li>
      <li>After reading the reviews I was really interested.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using a combination of organic and biodynamic-based skin care products (Weleda and Acure), a potent anti-aging serum from Visual Changes (Resurrection) and a bi-weekly routine with Nu-Face Trinity.</li>
      <li>I stopped using the cream and my face started getting better instantly.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Very effect for my wife!</li>
      <li>My pores are noticeably smaller, skin color is more even, and skin texture is firmer.  </li>
      <li>For starters, the bottle with the dropper, and the watery consistency of the product, is just too easy to knock over and spill (which I have done), much to my horror, and given the hetfy price I paid for a 30 ml bottle, I nearly had a heart attack.</li>
      <li>I did this in the morning and used, also for the first time, pure Retinol 1.0 in the evenings.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Cellex-C High Potency Serum for several years (maybe more than 10 by now?).  </li>
      <li>Initially I combined it with the Hydra B5 serum, which was also great, but to keep costs down I decided to stick with the Vitamin C.</li>
      <li>My skin is oily on my nose and cheeks, and so my pores are large.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed some significant changes in my face and neckline over the past 2 years, namely sagging jowl-line, chin lines, more eye wrinkles and sagging eyelids.</li>
      <li>Really like how this feels and goes on.</li>
      <li>Just a word of caution for others not to try to do too much all at once like I did.</li>
      <li>I really like this product</li>
      <li>This is one product for aging that really works.  </li>
      <li>I have been using it every day for 3 months and can really tell the difference.</li>
      <li>Highly, highly recommend!</li>
      <li>, you have a $30 return policy from when THEY send it not when it is billed to your account, thus not leaving much time to return as their policy is 30 day.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was introduced to this product by dermotologist in 2001. It is my #1 serum.  I&#x27;m 50, and many of my 40 year old friends show stronger signs of aging.  I owe my youthful appearance to Cellex-C.</li>
    <li> I was recommended this product for youthful skin, and I really enjoy the skin firming qualities that I&#x27;ve experienced too.  The serum is easily applied; I use nightly after cleansing and about 30 minutes or more before I go to sleep.  My skin is oily on my nose and cheeks, and so my pores are large.  Cellex-C has noticeably reduced my pores, increased my skin&#x27;s elasticity, and given my ruddy complexion a smoother less red color.  I love this product!</li>
    <li> Best price from Amazon.  I have used this for years and it works! it works! it works! I get compliments on my skin constantly.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years after learning about it from my plastic surgeon&#x27;s Spa Office.  It has delayed wrinkles for years.  I love it.</li>
    <li> This product came from the Beauty Box and it is expired over one month. I simply can&#x27;t believe that they would do something like that. It is known to everyone, that vitamin C serums have short shelf life, but to send a customer an expired product? I just can&#x27;t believe it. I guess it&#x27;s better to pay the full price, and not to deal with returns and disappointment.</li>
    <li> I can feel it going into my skin-- I noticed a difference within a week.  This product works for me, but it is not good for sensitive skin types.  I had not used it for some time due to the price and availability, but I am happy to use it again as I can see and feel the difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the product for years with great success.  I really notice  the difference when I don&#x27;t use it for a couple of weeks!!!    It was great to get it at a discount, quickly and easily.  I&#x27;ll use  this company again!!</li>
    <li> I discovedred Cellex-C a few months ago, and it was \\&quot;love at first sight\\&quot;. When I applied it on the skin, my skin felt different from the first application onwards. I use it in combination with Cellex-C&#x27;s skin hydration complex. Both products are available in two strengths. I use the lighter version of both products and consider them fully sufficient. Once I got a sample of the stronger version of the hydration complex, and it was too thick in texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the products every evening or every other evening, depending on how my skin feels. The skin feels baby-soft and nourished - just wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also ordered an eye care product of Cellex-C and will comment on that when I have started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to sum up my opinion of Cellex-C in four words, those would be \\&quot;never again without it\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> The seller was very fast in answering my questions.  The product came undamaged and had not expired.  I have been using this product for at least 4 years. Great product --great price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Cellex-C High Potency Serum for several years (maybe more than 10 by now?).  As a 50-year old woman who&#x27;s fairly low-maintenance when it comes to skin care, this is a product I decided to stick with.  I think it makes a difference to my skin texture &amp; tone.</li>
    <li> I have suffered from mild to moderate acne since stopping birth control pills four years ago. I&#x27;m 31 now and am tired of feeling like a teenager! I have very oily skin, too, and a few sun spots. I bought Cellex-C Vitamin C serum out of desperation. I feel like I&#x27;ve tried almost everything else. All I can say is WOW!! I wish I had discovered this years ago. The change to my skin was almost immediate, but after 3 months of consistent use my skin is 90% better. My skin feels soft and smooth and not nearly as oily. And I hardly get any breakouts anymore! This is magic in a bottle. It&#x27;s expensive, yes, but worth every penny. Initially I combined it with the Hydra B5 serum, which was also great, but to keep costs down I decided to stick with the Vitamin C. It&#x27;s still working like a charm. Highly, highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I use this with Hydro B and the two products are fabulous.  I have used both of them for 14 years and my skin looks and feels younger.</li>
    <li> The best. Switched to Skinceuticals for about 6 months but came back to this one; the original, and the best. And cheaper than Skinceuticals!</li>
    <li> Excellent product - highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I went from no routine other than cleansing, and maybe using ProActiv at times to using the High Potency Serum, with the Hydra 5 B Complex and the Sea Silk Moisturizer in the morning AFTER using the Neutrogena Buffing Cleanser that exfoliates (thought I would create a better way for the product to get in and work).  I did this in the morning and used, also for the first time, pure Retinol 1.0 in the evenings.  After 3 days, my face became red and inflammed, burning and stinging, and nothing eased the pain.  Just had to wait it out.  It took about 4 days to settle down.  I&#x27;ve been putting the Cellex-C on the thin skin of my wrist and lower arm every OTHER day to check for allergic reaction..and testing the retinol on the other.  So far, so good.  After all I have read, I am still encouraged this is a good product.  Just a word of caution for others not to try to do too much all at once like I did.</li>
    <li> Joan Collins was quoted a long time ago saying \\&quot;I wouldn&#x27;t live without my Cellux serum\\&quot;.  it does wonders, especially for scars.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and great product, one of the few cosmetics companies that put an expiration date on the container, the box and the actual container.  I wish more companies did this.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I really like this product, It has helped smooth my skin, and less break outs, I think this is key for aging skin too !  I notice it has made a difference.</li>
    <li> I can finally order this skin ooompher in between appointments.  A few drops goes far when it comes to getting those fine lines to reduce.</li>
    <li> You can tell if this product is fresh by the color.  If it is light (like a really bad light beer) then it is fresh.  Once it starts to turn a bit more orange, the vitamin C is oxidizing.  This usually happens when you get towards the bottom of a 2 oz/60 ml bottle.  This product was very fresh.  It arrived quickly.  My only complaint is that it is very difficult to find this product in the 60 ml/2 oz size bottle which I much prefer.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for several years.  I like it and you cannot beat the price from this supplier, especially compared to what my dermatologist charges for it.</li>
    <li> This serum is good.  But I found I could make my own at a fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> Really like how this feels and goes on. My skin looks fantastic and really radiant and healthy. People keep commenting on how young I look.</li>
    <li> Love this product...it goes hand in hand with Hydra 5 complex I have been using for 10years and live in Southern Calif</li>
    <li> I immediately could feel and see the difference!! My dry skin now has a healthy glow!!!</li>
    <li> Awesome delivery time and product.  I would recommend this product to my girlfriends and family members. Great serum. I just love this product!</li>
    <li> This product had no effect on my skin.  I have used Skin Ceuticals in the past and will go back to that product.</li>
    <li> Very effect for my wife! Good price for Germany</li>
    <li> The only reason I even looked this product up is because it was mentioned specifically in a continuing education  piece on aging. After reading the reviews I was really interested. I&#x27;m now on my second bottle and my skin loves it! It has smoothed out, my cystic acne along my jawline has greatly improved (using along with retin-A). The prescription for retin-A is working so much better in conjunction with Cellex. I&#x27;m definitely going to continue using.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for approximately 15 years - love it!  Cellex-C has some of the best products money can buy.</li>
    <li> Love love love this is my go to staple works with hydra b5 can&#x27;t wait to order more of this</li>
    <li> this is great product, I received from Amazon.com about a month ago, and I have been using since then, This is a must have product. My skin looks much better, I can see the difference, the skin looks brighter,little tighter.  Overall I am going to use this for a long long time, maybe next order, I will have it with hydration booster together.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years....(I am 70) People always comment on my beautiful skin.  I uses in primarily on the lines by my eyes and mouth... and left over on my neck... I think everyone should use this product...</li>
    <li> I love this product and find it very effective.</li>
    <li> I am a 21 year old asian female with combination skin and struggle with a bit of acne and acne scars. I wasted so much money by trying out different pharmaceutical products and high end products to get rid of my acne and scars. I even tried using clarisonic but it was way too harsh on my skin so I had to return it. This product was recommended to me by my boyfriend; he told me that when he was getting his skin treated in Korea, the clinic used this same serum brand for his skin. (they used the advanced one but that seemed too harsh for my skin) After two days I definitely saw a difference. My skin felt like it was glowing. I never knew what people meant when they said their skin glowed, but now I think I know! After over a week of using this product, my acne scars have lightened, giving me hope that if I continue using this, it will definitely give me clear skin.&lt;br /&gt;It is important that you do not use more than 3 drops because this is very acidic, it will irritate your skin. I like to mix three drops of this with my SK-II treatment essence and apply it with my fingers, tapping it until it feels like it is absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by a dermatologist because it is made at a molecular level that will penetrate your skin so you get the full affects of the vitamin C.  I use it every day and you will see the difference in your skin after several weeks.  A lot cheaper to buy through Amazon than from a dermatologist.  Exact same product, you save money and can have it delivered to your door.</li>
    <li> The serum was already brown not clear indicating this is old stock. Only good for 4 months meaning I wasted money ordering here.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it truly work to improve skin texture, lightens age spots while smoothing fine lines. Use this product with Renova. Wash face waiting 20 minutes until face completely dry until using Renova to reduce redness and peeling. Two products work awesome together.</li>
    <li> Great anti-aging serum!</li>
    <li> Use this product all the time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and believe it really helps reduce dark spots and wrinkles</li>
    <li> Celex-C Purchase.  My wife swears by it as does the plastic surgeon who recommended it. The rationale fits the results well.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I have been using it fir years &amp; rate it a 5 star!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and have found it to be extremely good for my skin. Especially for small wrinkles around eyes and the lines between nostrils and lips.</li>
    <li> I like the Cellex C eye contour cream.   I decided to try Cellex C products after a coworker said she was pleased with the product (long term use, she was in her late 40&#x27;s and her skin looked fabulous), and also because I came across before and after photos in a magazine that caught my attention.   I can&#x27;t say that I particularly care for the serum.  For starters, the bottle with the dropper, and the watery consistency of the product, is just too easy to knock over and spill (which I have done), much to my horror, and given the hetfy price I paid for a 30 ml bottle, I nearly had a heart attack. It&#x27;s a minor inconvenience.   The product itself has to be kept out of sunlight, but they claim that any changes in the color (it gets darker as it ages) doesn&#x27;t affect the efficacy, but I&#x27;ve also read that the product loses efficacy over time. I&#x27;ve had the eye contour cream over a year now, so if that also loses efficacy over time, then I basically have a useless product (I can&#x27;t possibly use an entire jar of undereye cream in a few months) in my medicine cabinet.  I understand everything has a shelf life, but I also don&#x27;t want to be rushed to use these expensive products in x amount of months.   In terms of the product application itself, I do experience a slight tingling, and I noticed the next day my skin is somewhat irritated -- I do however have sensitive skin, and this product is not recommended for those with \\&quot;very sensitive skin\\&quot;. I&#x27;m sure there are varying degrees of \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; so it&#x27;s all relative. I typically avoid products with harsh or overpowering fragrances, and totally avoid salicylic acids (Benzoyl Peroxide) as my face would break out in hives.  I did not break out in hives, I only had a slight irritation. As such, it was not used religiously as part of my nightly ritual. Sporadic at best.   With the hefty price tag (I think I paid over $100), I think I&#x27;ll try my luck with other products. While I wouldn&#x27;t deter anyone from trying these products, I don&#x27;t have a reason to particularly rave about them either (though I probably will continue to use the eye contour cream as I&#x27;ve no complaints). Whether it is providing me with anti-aging or anti-wrinkle benefits remains to be seen. I&#x27;m in my late 30&#x27;s and have been blessed with a younger appearance, so I&#x27;m using these products as more a preventive than a correction.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a non injection route to firming up my skin around the jowl area.  This definitely works and at the lower price of $46 well worth the investment.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this is doing the job, however when they say it turns color, they mean it! It is&lt;br /&gt;a very dark orangey brown, actually turns my face a weird color also. Make up does&lt;br /&gt;cover it up. Feels like water when you put it on, so between that and the color, I won&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;buy it again. I like something that is more like a serum. Tried to contact them about&lt;br /&gt;the dark  color and they did not reply.</li>
    <li> I have used this religiously for years. Great skin care product.</li>
    <li> The product is great.  The shelf life was only 30 days</li>
    <li> Used it for years.Does what it&#x27;s supposed to.Arrived in good shape,no complaints at all.</li>
    <li> Well, this product it does help to firme my face, but at the same time it did change my skin tone... It Darken my skin tone.. which I never really asked for.. All I want was to firme my skin..I did benefit from it,  but at the same time, I do not like it,  for the fact that it Darken my skin.. I have beautiful skin tone, I do not need to darken my skin tone... because of that I discontinued using it for my face, instead used it for my chest!  I could have ordered this product again.. but since it has negative and positive result.. I only want POSITIVE RESULT NOTHING LESS! not going to order this produc again, I will look around some other product, I am not going to ask refund, because I benefit 50% of it from this product!</li>
    <li> I see such a difference when using this product. Wrinkled are less noticeable and my skin feels firmer and smoother. My only issue (and I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m alone on this or not), but I seem to break out more while using this product along with the Skin Firming cream.  I&#x27;ll keep using it because the results so noticeable.</li>
    <li> This made my skin look great. However, beware putting this on while sitting down, or in excessive amounts. It will stain bedding, carpeting, etc, if it touches fabric. Overall, worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I noticed the improvement in my skin within a few weeks.  My pores are noticeably smaller, skin color is more even, and skin texture is firmer.  I&#x27;m a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> To be honest, I had high hopes for this based on all the reviews. However after 3 months of regular use, I cannot say that I see a difference in my skin. I will probably not buy this again, but will continue to use the rest of the bottle (can&#x27;t hurt, right?) and if I do end up seeing a difference over a few more months I will update this post.</li>
    <li> This is amazing my skin is clear and smooth and notice a big difference when I don&#x27;t use it.being 57 and looking 15 years younger is what you will experience if you we&#x27;re to buy this prouduct . I recommend it to anyone who want to look younger and will continue to buy .</li>
    <li> This is one product for aging that really works.  I have been using it every day for 3 months and can really tell the difference.</li>
    <li> I am stuck on this product; it has helped with my break-outs and irritated skin. Perfect amount of hydration without being an oil slick on my face. Very pleased and will continue to use.</li>
    <li> This cream is absolutely terrible.  I tried the trial 14 days and my skin developed red dry spots, made my under eye area worse color and puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;I have always had good skin, however I am aging so I was interested in this cream as it had such great results on the website.  I did not have &amp;#34;great results&amp;#34; actually as I stated.  I stopped using the cream and my face started getting better instantly.  I went back on my regular cream &amp;#34; Neostrata&amp;#34; and my skin is back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also ensure you read all the papers with your 14 day trail, I didn&#x27;t cancel on time so they send you another full priced shipment ( approximately ($85) without notifying you, you have a $30 return policy from when THEY send it not when it is billed to your account, thus not leaving much time to return as their policy is 30 day.  I was ONE day passed and they would not do anything for me.  I felt a bit scammed.</li>
    <li> Cellex-c high potency serum really works. After a couple months of using it daily, several people commented on how good my skin looked and wanted to know my secret. Try it and you will be amazed.</li>
    <li> The product was as I expected.</li>
    <li> i enjoyed this product years ago and again now.</li>
    <li> Great product for wrinkle prevention :)</li>
    <li> I have used Cellex-C for only one month but I can feel it working when I apply it and my skin looks better already.  I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I have been using it for years.  You will pay more, if you buy it from the dermatologist.</li>
    <li> a very good product , my wife love it !!! very good for the face skin  !!!</li>
    <li> My skin is 50+ and I&#x27;ve noticed some significant changes in my face and neckline over the past 2 years, namely sagging jowl-line, chin lines, more eye wrinkles and sagging eyelids. I&#x27;ve been using a combination of organic and biodynamic-based skin care products (Weleda and Acure), a potent anti-aging serum from Visual Changes (Resurrection) and a bi-weekly routine with Nu-Face Trinity. Yeah, it takes a lot of effort to stay youthful! Anyway, my skin actually looks pretty good, but the jowl and chin &#x27;saggies&#x27; have been especially challenging. Within one week of using Cellex-C high potency serum, my chin line is nearly unnoticeable. The product has virtually no scent and is absorbed very quickly by my skin. I now use it after washing my face in the morning and upon going to bed. Since using Cellex-C, my facial skin has tightened nicely.  (On top of it, I dab Weleda&#x27;s Skin Food for a dewy complexion. Once that&#x27;s absorbed, I apply liquid makeup to my hyperpigmentation areas and I&#x27;m good to go.) I will continue to recommend and use Cellex-C.</li>
    <li> For my 60-something year old skin living in an extremely dry climate. He recommends this Cellex-C used with Cosmedix moisturizer. There has been a noticeable difference since I began the regime 8 months ago. Healthier skin with a clarity and glow, less noticeable fine lines. I will continue using this product. . .</li>
