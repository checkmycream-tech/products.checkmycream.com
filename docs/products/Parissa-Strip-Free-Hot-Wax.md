<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Always works well.  Pleasant scent.  Easy to use and save lots of money over having done at salon.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this wax it was a bit hard.  Yet, after using it a few times, I think that I have the technique.  It does leave the skin nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> I have PCOS and, unfortunately, one of the side effects is facial hair growth. Over time, it has gotten pretty bad and trimming/plucking just doesn&#x27;t cut it anymore. I&#x27;m also cursed with very sensitive skin and fast hair growth, so shaving is also a no go. I wanted to try waxing, but was too embarrassed to have it done at a salon. I&#x27;d read from others that a lot of at home waxing products don&#x27;t work for thick, coarse hair (especially the no heat strips), but this seemed promising, especially because everything needed comes with the kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This worked exceptionally well for me. The instructions were easy to follow, even for someone with no experience with this at all. I screwed up the first patch by leaving it on too long, but I quickly picked up how to do it and had no issues. Though I have a lot of hair to remove, this got nearly all of it in one go.I did end up doing some areas twice, and may still need to pluck a bit, but I&#x27;m very pleased with the amount it removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely hurt, but there&#x27;s really no way for this to do its job and not hurt. The only pain came from the hair being pulled out, not from the heat or anything chemical. I had to reheat this a few times, and each time I waited for the right consistency and checked the temperature with my finger before I started applying it to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To do my entire under chin area, side burn area and part of my cheeks (including going over some spots a second time), I used a little over half of the wax. If you have a lot of hair to remove, expect this wax to last maybe two or three times. If you&#x27;re doing a smaller area, I imagine it would last quite some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issues are that there&#x27;s a bit of a smell to the wax (it&#x27;s not awful, but it&#x27;s definitely not pleasant) and that I had to keep reheating it. I&#x27;m waiting to see how long it takes for my hair to grow back and how my skin reacts to that, but if waxing is worth it, I plan to buy the wax warmer so I don&#x27;t have to keep returning to my stove. Also, I&#x27;ve looked around and don&#x27;t see anywhere to buy larger amounts of this wax at a time, so it could get rather pricey.keep returning to my stove. Also, I&#x27;ve looked around and don&#x27;t see anywhere to buy larger amounts of this wax at a time, so it could get rather pricey.</li>
    <li> OK, the upside - when layered on thick , it does remove a certain amount of hair. it dries up real quick, and is hence easy to clean...because it can be scraped off most surfaces easily.    Flipside - I needed to use this multiple times to completely remove all the hair , and IT ALWAYS HURTS LIKE CRAZY! I&#x27;ve used other microwave wax removal kits, that do a much better job , with much less pain..PLUS, the end result looks very patchy. I also felt the lack of use of waxing strips made it less effective.    Overall, you&#x27;d be better off using a standard 10$ microwave wax kit.</li>
    <li> Too much of a pain to heat this on the stove in the little metal pan. Then the wax is either too hot to apply or it hardens too fast and doesn&#x27;t serve the intended purpose. I&#x27;d liken the product to hot bubble gum at an upcharge. Let&#x27;s face it, waxing is best left to the pros.</li>
    <li> This is the only facial wax that I will purchase.  I find myself using it once a month on my chin and upper lip.  I have notice the hairs getting thinner.  Yes it is painful.  But then you are pulling melted wax off of you face.</li>
    <li> I have been waxing my eyebrows for 4 years now. I would like to give this a better review, but cannot. I wanted a change from waxing strips and found good reviews on this product. I had no trouble heating it, or even applying to my first eyebrow which turned out fairly good. However, on my second eyebrow a huge glob fell on the middle of my brow. Frantic I began trying to remove the wax with wax remover from the kit. After scrubbing for about 1 minute my eyebrow hair fell onto the counter and I was left with a huge gap in my brow... Not to mention that this was probably the most painful wax job I&#x27;ve ever had. I&#x27;m all for no pain to gain, and KNOW that waxing is painful, but this was just rediculous. It was like an indian rug burn and slow and painful...     I didn&#x27;t completely hate the product, although after cursing this product because I will be stenciling an eyebrow until hair grows back, I would recommend this product to someone who is just doing an upper lip or a larger safer area to wax like legs or something. It seemed the larger the area the better it worked. It worked just fine for my unibrow between my brows and wasn&#x27;t as painful as the other parts of my brow... Good luck.</li>
    <li> This is amazing.  It gets those little stubborn hairs and when your hair does grown back..it grows back thin and fine.  I love it.</li>
    <li> This is for my mother, she has used it for years and loves it!</li>
    <li> This is a good home wax. It actually works, although there is a bit of a learning curve, and it didn&#x27;t irritate my extremely sensitive skin. Yes, it hurts. It hurts like waxing hurts - nothing more, nothing less. I was able to rip the wax off quickly and so the pain didn&#x27;t last long. It&#x27;s a bit messy, but again, learning curve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered more because now I want to do my whole body (heh) and I included the wax warmer on my second order just for the convenience of having the wax warmer in the bathroom with me while I work.</li>
    <li> I have such a hard time finding hot wax in stores, so tried this product.  I absolutely love it.  It&#x27;s easy to use and works GREAT!</li>
    <li> WHile this product worked ok on my upper lip and chin. . No where in its description did it talk about HOW to heat.. it comes in a tiny little pot that is NOT microwaveable .. thus for me it was a stove ..We use a Gas store and even the smallest burner was too large for it.. thus heating the handle. .and then it was either drag the mirror to the kitchen (not a lot of light) or risk spilling the pot on the way to the bathroom with the brighter light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wayy too much effort and risk for me</li>
    <li> This produce is good for removing the smallest and finest of hairs. You can use your fingers to apply and remove the wax to the area you&#x27;re waxing. It can get tricky on how to remove it from your fingers or get the right temperature on the wax.</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use and works.  Problem was that the next day I woke up looking like I had been punched in both eyes.  I could barely open my left eye.  Since it works for others I will assume it is just that I didn&#x27;t realize I have sensitive skin...</li>
    <li> This product is awesome..wish I had found it earlier in life just glad I found it now!! It doesnt hurt and it takes ALL of the hair..its amazing..this is just the wax and pot..u have to order the wax warmer also..BUT well worth it!!</li>
    <li> I bought it for my 10 year old daughter - for removing her mustache. Even though the first removal hearts, it&#x27;s the best most efficient product I found. The second removal is less hearting and it is the only way I can use for a 10 year old.&lt;br /&gt;It is not very efficient on very short hair, so once every 1-2 weeks works good for us.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been battling coarse hair on my chin for a couple of years. I&#x27;ve tried depilatories, epilators, threading, shaving and tweezing. Some have been disastrous while others just left me unsatisfied. I was a little weary to try strip free wax, but I was desperate and I felt encourage by the positive reviews. I wasn&#x27;t confident with the process on my first try and I made a mess. The second try was it! Bamm! With very little pain the coarse hair was gone and I felt smooth. I&#x27;ve been waiting for this for a long time. I&#x27;m ecstatic. I recommend getting the electric warmer. Heating it on the stove is a pain and can alter your results. Also, make sure you have some extra spatulas. The one&#x27;s provided are only good for a single use.</li>
    <li> This product was awesome for myself, due to lack of experience with the waxing process. It got out a lot of the long and wirey hairs however, it did not get any of my peach fuzz(which was highly disappointing considering that I bought it for that purpose). In no way does this devalue the product. It says on the box that it is best used with thicker hair. My only qualm with this product was that it made quite the mess in my bathroom. It&#x27;s been a week and I&#x27;m still finding strings of green wax in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great product for quick and easy removal of coarse hair.&lt;br /&gt;Probably not the best for those with finer hair or peach fuzz</li>
    <li> I got this wax based on the reviews, but and completely dissatisfied with it.  It is not easy to use and hurts so much on the face when pulling it off. I&#x27;ve only tried it on my face, but probably won&#x27;t try it again since it was very difficult to use.</li>
    <li> I have done sugaring (MOOM and Parissa), used pre-waxed strips (MOOM and Parissa, and have used topical creams that dissolve unwanted hair (Nair). None of these have compared to the QUICK and awesome results that I got with this hot wax. Hot wax definitely is NOT painless, but it is ridiculously quick since you don&#x27;t have to go over the same area more than once (something I&#x27;ve had to do with sugaring in particular). The pain does not come from the heat of the wax itself--it is actually a comfortable temperature by the time it touches your skin--but from when you peel back the wax away from your skin. But, that just means it is doing its job--removing hair. I did have to reheat the wax once or twice on the stove, so I think the portable wax warmer is a pretty good investment.</li>
    <li> This wax is absolutely amazing!  I have never waxed myself. I have always let a professional do it, but the for the last few years I have had a horrible problem with facial hair.  I use to have to use a facial trimmer every other day.  Now I only have to wax about every 4-5 days.  I am so excited and hope over time that I wont have to wax as often, but this is still way better then the facial trimmer.  I also really like that you don&#x27;t use strips with this wax.  I use to go to a lady that used this type of wax, but ever since I moved 6 years ago I could not find anyone that used hot wax. I bought a coffee mug warmer instead of the wax warmer because the coffer warmer was 3.99 and it works very good.  They are basically the same thing and I saved 15 dollars!</li>
    <li> It is funny reading some of these reviews.  If you don&#x27;t like pain, don&#x27;t wax...it hurts...nothing will change that.  But let&#x27;s talk about results...because there is nothing worse than going through the pain AND having bad results.  The bottom line...this wax works.  End of story.  It has the consistency of salon wax and whatever hairs you hit with it are coming out...end of story.  I just used it for the first time and was wowed.  Yes, it was a \\&quot;hot mess.\\&quot;  My technique clearly will take some time to work out, I had random drips on my face..etc.  I waited too long at first to pull it off, that was not fun...OUCH!  But Rome wasn&#x27;t built in a day.  Hands down this is the most effective home wax out there and even after my almost comical first use this morning, I can say my results were spectacular...I look like I just left the salon and I know it will get even better once I am used to working with the product.</li>
    <li> Very good at cleanly removing darker hair from the upper lip. Just don&#x27;t leave it on low forever on your stove - it melts faster than you&#x27;d think. Make it honey thick for easier and more accurate application. If you heat it up too much and it becomes much thinner, just stir a bit until you get back to the honey thick texture. Build up a little lip on the edge where you&#x27;re going to pull so you don&#x27;t have to pick off thin bits that got left behind. Don&#x27;t repeat over same area in the same session. I am pretty fair but with menopause I&#x27;ve gotten darker hairs on my lip and under my nostrils. I tend to get a bit pink after a session in the waxed areas, but it&#x27;s all gone by the next day - so I do it in the evening before I sleep. Daughter who has darker hair doesn&#x27;t have this reddening at all and can go out right away.</li>
    <li> The wax works well in pulling out hair, my only issue was it&#x27;s like you have to be trained to use this stuff. It&#x27;s really difficult to spread the wax evenly before it dries. Id much rather get it done professionally rather than struggle with this</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! It works exactly as described. My only comment is that the tin needs a lid for storage.</li>
    <li> Really enjoyed using this wax - much simpler as you don&#x27;t need a strip/cloth for this wax. However, you need multiple boxes of this product if you want to do half legs or any other medium to large areas. Considering the cost of the product, it is a bit expensive hence 4 stars.</li>
    <li> I had a good experience with this wax, but if you are going to use it USE A WARMER! Period. It was almost impossible for me to keep the wax at the proper temperature warming it on the stove, which is why I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5. I probably spent 2/3rds of my time waiting for the wax to warm up or cool down rather than actually waxing. When the wax was at the proper temperature I worked very well and was easy to use. The included instructions were easy to follow and I don&#x27;t feel like they left anything out. There is a light scent to the wax, so if you are very sensitive to scents you might want to avoid this. However, it isn&#x27;t strong and the scent wasn&#x27;t deposited on me at all. Also, the included oil seemed to help a lot with post-waxing irritation. I did several areas in one day, and the areas I did with the Parissa hox wax and oil after are much less red and irritated than the areas I did with regular wax and cloth strips without the oil after.</li>
    <li> I used to think it was the most amazing wax, especially the pre-waxed strips they sell, but I&#x27;ve since found wax that gets ALL of the coarse hair in one swipe. The parissa is great for finer hair, so it will get all of the softer hair on legs or arms, etc. As far as bikini and eyebrows goes, it just won&#x27;t get it all. I am Italian, but have relatively fine and light hair. If you go for bikini or eyebrows (or anywhere stubborn) you will have to keep plucking afterward, or go over the same spots with more wax. I think people that love it are perhaps in the same boat as I was, where it&#x27;s significantly better than many at home options, but not realizing there are much better ones available for bikini and stubborn hair. If you are only waxing arms, legs, even mustache, you are probably good with Parissa. Also, if your bikini, etc., is very fine and not coarse. If you are waxing bikini, eyebrows, underarms, or more stubborn and/or coarse hair, this isn&#x27;t the best wax for you. I switched to Sally Hansen Extra Strength but I am leaving a review there too because it is crazy strong and you have to be really CAREFUL! Alright, that&#x27;s my two cents. happy waxing!</li>
    <li> I suppose it&#x27;s my fault for not reading more into the product description, but I was looking for microwave safe waxing kits. I don&#x27;t want to have to purchase a separate heating unit...</li>
    <li> I have tried a similar product so I knew I should expect it to be messy. Once applied, it dries on hard like a cast. You then peel it off and the finer the hair is, the more painful it is to pull off of that area. It does remove short course hair  (I&#x27;m an African American female) so that is a plus. It just doesn&#x27;t remove ALL of the hair the first time.  Also it comes in a small metal pan which I heat on the stove. That was surprising because I&#x27;m used to wax coming in a container with a lid on it. But anyway, it&#x27;s an ok product. It does remove short course hair and many other waxes do not, so for that I give this 3 stars.</li>
    <li> This is a great and easy product to use. Purchased it to do my eyebrows. A bit messy at first if your not use to handling the wax but clean ups are easy. One suggestion: buy smaller sticks for eyebrow use.</li>
    <li> I just tried this for the first time and I think I&#x27;m sold. It wasn&#x27;t as intimidating as I expected. The wax was a bit drippy and I got it on the counter, my sweatshirt and the ground (oops!) , but I&#x27;m guessing I&#x27;ll get the technique down better with practice. I have very sensitive skin and usually break out and swell up when I get my eyebrows done in the salon, but that didn&#x27;t happen this time. It hurt a lot, but that goes with the waxing territory. I didn&#x27;t have to reapply anywhere either, it took it all off. I&#x27;d recommend it for sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> This was my first time trying hard wax at home. It is a little messy and I have yet to perfect how long to heat it on the stove. However, it works really well. I can&#x27;t stand using wax strips - they seem easy but they don&#x27;t pull the hair out as well. I would definitely recommend this product, just follow the directions carefully!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a wax that was good on removing &amp;#34;actual&amp;#34; hair and this one does the job pretty well.  My advise is to read ALL the directions and follow it because if not it can get very messy and painful.&lt;br /&gt;This product is not too harsh on the skin but if you leave the wax on longer than instructed it will be painful.&lt;br /&gt;The best part is that it did not irritate my sensitive skin and left it feeling smooth!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend.</li>
    <li> Great at home hair removal option. Simple and effective. I would buy again for sure. I use it on my face and works great.</li>
    <li> This wax works really well and it gentle on the skin. I would recommend it if you want to do your own wax job</li>
    <li> yes, it worked very nice and I didn&#x27;t have to deal with the strips - much easier.</li>
    <li> I used to go to a salon to have my upper lip waxed and have never done it myself. I found this easy to use and very effective. I have sensitive skin and had no irritation (except for the sting one expects when waxing, of course). I can&#x27;t believe I haven&#x27;t just been waxing on my own all along!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I found that putting it in a small pan with a little water in it melts it quickly and evenly.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not all that great. It leaves hair patches which even if you redo the wax won&#x27;t catch. I&#x27;ve used Parissa wax before but it was the kind where cloth strips were needed and that worked great. This formula, I don&#x27;t like it at all and don&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Love this...Normally would go every two weeks professionally for upper lip. If you need to save money this helps:) Execellent for fine hair. Very messy at first, but if you&#x27;re not a monkey eventually you&#x27;ll develop a routine to prevent the wax from getting everywhere. And there are no application sticks, so you need to buy or recycle ice cream pop sticks:)) After awhile you&#x27;ll question why you even bothered paying someone to do this?!?</li>
    <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered this product.  The instructions are thorough and the wax is easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;A first time wax user may have to practice a couple of times for desired results, but it is a very good product, and the only brand I will use.&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> Did  not  work as well  as I expected  very messy. To use.  does not grab short hair. Well.</li>
    <li> I have tried NUMEROUS products for facial hair removal. Tweezers, pre-waxed strips, heated wax &amp; muslin, \\&quot;natural\\&quot; wax that you could wash off with water. All these products worked to some degree...but NOTHING compares to this fabulous no-strip wax. It literally grabs onto every little hair and r-i-p out they come. OF COURSE this hurts...you are ripping out hair and OF COURSE there is a learning curve. I have used this once and had better luck on my chin than upper lip. All in all I think this is a fabulous product for the money AND it works great.</li>
    <li> Worked pretty well which is great but heating it up in the little pot was a pain and I ended up with wax all over my stove. Next time I&#x27;m going to heat it up fully and transfer it into a jar so I can just microwave it.</li>
    <li> If you can handle the pain it is absolutely worth it.  the pain doesnt last a long time and the outcome is fantastic!!</li>
    <li> I love this!  It was a little messy but cleanup was way and it didn&#x27;t hurt at all.  Will definitely be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> I used this wax for the first time just a few weeks ago and was very pleased with the results. The only thing is I noticed very sparse hair growth only a week after I had first used this wax. I hope with continued use I will see less hair regrowth in a longer time frame then just a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also found for best results to heat it up on the stove until it is melted to a thick liquid consistancy and then remove from stove and begin stirring to cool down wax. Then I apply it when it is still hot, but not hot enough to burn skin when you apply. When I did this, although briefly painful I found it gave better results for removing more hair, even the most short and difficult hairs. I was worried it would burn my skin, but it did not. Plus the more you do this, the hot affect does not bother as much once you are use to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this wax, for anyone who would like to get professional results.</li>
    <li> Found out this is not my cup of tea. It removes hair as promised, it&#x27;s just that self inflicted pain is far worse than someone else doing it. Getting drunk didn&#x27;t even help the pain, I ended up pulling hair by hair when I realized the wax wasn&#x27;t going to come off any other way. I don&#x27;t plan on ever doing this again.</li>
    <li> This takes some time to get used to, but once you&#x27;ve figured out how to do it, it works great. You definitely need to get a feel for the amount of wax to put on, not too much not too little, and how long to leave it on for. Too little was or too much time left on the hair can make removal more difficult.</li>
    <li> Yes, it does remove some of the hair, but it is next to impossible to remove the wax.  The wax simply does not set right after it&#x27;s applied.  I have used other parissa kits without having this problem. I have tried everything.  Additionally it is extremely difficult to clean up even with the azulene oil. The wax just stays too gummy to be able to zip it off and get good removal. i won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> Best solution I have found for a guy trying to remove hair from his ears.</li>
    <li> I tried this wax because it&#x27;s the same type that is used in my salon. I planned on waxing my jawline and upper lip. This is not meant for beginner waxing! I&#x27;m not saying the product is bad - it&#x27;s just hard to work with if you don&#x27;t know exactly what you&#x27;re doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Difficulties:&lt;br /&gt;Warming up to the right temperature/consistency (in a pan with water on the stove)&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t maintain the temperature, so it kept hardening.&lt;br /&gt;Trying to spread the wax and pull away, but didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;Became a big blob stuck on my fingers after trying to wax&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wax strip products were way more user friendly. The parissa brand, sally hansen, veet and others are fine.</li>
    <li> It smells good, and the directions are helpful. Super handy that it comes in its own pot, easy to heat up.</li>
    <li> This wax works great as long as you use it correctly.  The first time I let it dry a few seconds too long and it got very crackly and was very difficult to remove.  About 5 seconds is all you need and it works very well.  Yes, it still hurts some like waxing with cloth strips but you don&#x27;t have to cut strips and apply.</li>
    <li> Great for removing facial hair. My wife loves this stuff.</li>
    <li> Messier and way more painful than others I&#x27;ve tried. Have to keep heating it back up. But it does work well.</li>
    <li> Parissa Strip Free Hot Wax is easy to use and it works!  I have to do very little follow up tweezing, if at all. This is a good product that I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> Not very effective and makes a mess. Every time I pulled off a strip of wax, there were very few to no hairs on it. It dries up into a hard plastic-like thing and when you pull it off it doesn&#x27;t hurt much because it&#x27;s not really holding on to the hairs. I prefer Nads wax strips. They get rid of more hair and don&#x27;t make a mess.</li>
    <li> I have tried every brand available for home waxing and I won&#x27;t buy any of that other USELESS stuff again. Follow the directions and this works. It comes with its own sturdy little pan. Put it on a little thickish then pull it off while you still feel it is warm. Off course it hurts. You&#x27;re ripping hair out by the roots. However this works so well you don&#x27;t have to do it over and over and over to clear an area. Do NOT wash the area prior or else the spot will be too clean and the wax will stick to your skin and be terrible to get off.</li>
    <li> I used to use the Sally Hansen wax strips, and they were really hit-and-miss (usually miss). I often had to deal with a burning sensation and horrible splotchy irritation for 4 hours after use, breakouts, and the upper lip hair rarely came off (mine is of the dark and tenacious variety). As you can probably guess by now, I have very sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the Parissa wax, most of the hair came off with very little fuss AND there was no irritation whatsoever! I cannot stress how easy this stuff is to use. I, a complete beginner to strip-free wax, was able to get the wax to that honey-like consistency very easily. Since I only used it on my upper lip, I didn&#x27;t need to re-heat. Yes there were some hairs left, but I can tell that was due to inexperience and not the product itself. The raw, hair-pulling pain I felt tells me there&#x27;s a lot of potential here and that I just need to get used to using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One con of this product is the chemical smell it has. It&#x27;s not a terrible, stink-up-the-bathroom-all-night smell, but it IS pretty off-putting. Still, the Parissa wax is so easy to use, so effective and so cheap (seriously, with only upper lip waxings this stuff will last a century) that I&#x27;m willing to forgive them for the bad smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus points for the cute little glass vial the azulene oil comes in!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this wax other than Where have you been all my life?  I tried this after the Sally Hansen wax I used to use went from $6 to $25.  Let&#x27;s not get started on how/why that&#x27;s even possible...it doesn&#x27;t matter because this is so far superior that I&#x27;m bummed I ever even used the Sally wax.  I used this on my brows, upper lip and my jaw/chin.  I&#x27;m Italian and the hair ranges from fuzz to coarse and this lovely, lovely product takes care of it all.  If you have done your own strip-free waxing before you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem with this.  I had a few minor issues with fine threads of wax as I applied it but I&#x27;m sure with time I&#x27;ll perfect it.  The texture is easy to work with and even if you accidentally leave it on too long, it&#x27;s still pretty easy to pull off.  Unlike Sally, it came off easily and didn&#x27;t leave residue behind.  The few small spots that were sticky were easily cleaned with the accompanying oil.  It comes in a little metal pot with a handle that you can heat directly on a stove burner.  I actually heated mine in a shallow pan of water because I have a gas stove and was worried about the wax dripping and possibly starting a flame (I don&#x27;t know it that can happen but don&#x27;t want to find out).  If you are just waxing your face, you should get many uses from it.  I might actually invest in a warming unit because this wax makes me want to wax more often and more places.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about every wax out there trying to find one I like for brows and lips and this is my favorite. I warm it on the stove and it works great.</li>
    <li> I have course facial hair that is hard to remove. I like to do at home waxing since no appointment is needed. This is the only wax I use. It gets all the hair and does not make me break out after. I have been using this product for years and love it. It takes a couple times to get the hang of things but worth the effort.</li>
    <li> I set my kitchen stove on fire. Im sure this is a good product and all but its my first time waxing and i tried to read all the instructions carefully, but i guess i overlooked the danger of fire part. I never got to use the wax it just set on fire. All im saying who ever is going to use this product read the danger fire section in the instructions meticulously.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews although I love reading them while shopping on Amazon.  I just had to tell anyone considering purchasing this product that the other reviews are accurate. This wax is amazing. I bought the warmer, as well, so I wouldn&#x27;t have to watch it on the stove. It works just as well as salon waxing and saves alot of money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a bit amazed to see now that I purchased this product here at Amazon way back in 2006. (!) I&#x27;ve been using the same kit since that time, and I probably would still be using it except that I accidentally dumped 3/4 of the hot wax on my induction stovetop the other week.  (Boiling water and a rag cleaned it up quickly, the rest of my attempts were rather comical in retrospect!) Anyway, thankfully I bought two kits way back when, so this week I opened up my second kit and am wondering if my other kit originally had wax of that same color and consistency.  By the time I threw the other kit out, the wax--even when solid--was essentially the color of amber.  This second (but hardly &#x27;new&#x27;) kit of mine has wax that has a greenish tinge.  It looks more like the wax on the model that is pictured in the instruction booklet.  It seems to be thinner when melted, too...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any event, amber-colored or green, this wax does the trick.  Yes, I have to pass over certain parts of my face a few times to get everything, and it does NOT keep me &#x27;hair free&#x27; for umpteen weeks at a time, but the wax does WORK and I do look ready for a magazine shoot (haha) once I&#x27;m done a weekly session.  Does it hurt?  Sure it does, but you get used to it; however women with a lesser pain tolerance might find the process uncomfortable sometimes.  Yet once you get the hang of everything, burns will be few and far between, and although they package a few different wooden spatula things with the kits, I&#x27;ve found a shortened wooden kebob skewer to be very useful for waxing around the eyebrows.  Considering I think I&#x27;d rather die before I use anything harsh like Nair on my face, and while home threading systems have their pluses, I think Parissa hot wax is the best thing out there for keeping me hair-free (and the pretty, blue azulene oil is nice, too).  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This is quite literally just wax..... I got it EVERYWHERE AND could&#x27;ve remove it from anything. I ended up waxing hair that I didn&#x27;t want waxed and still have it all over my bathroom, STOVE, and my hair (on my head!) I went to make dinner on the stove and the wax drippings stunk up the house like a chemical spill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Horrible product! Smells like death and there is no way to have good precision</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I wanted to do my own home facial waxing without the mess and waxing strips. Very easy to apply and really works. It has been two weeks since I tried this product and my face is still smooth. No messy clean up required with this product and it actually comes with applicators of varying sizes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been getting waxed for years now, and while this takes me a lot longer than it would if I had it done professionally, it&#x27;s definitely worth it. This wax grips the shortest hairs and gets them completely at the root while I tend to have issues with hairs breaking even when I&#x27;ve spent $60+ on a Brazilian. Using the wax does have a slight learning curve — it&#x27;s easiest to remove if it&#x27;s hardened but still pliable. Also, be sure to apply in the opposite direction of hair growth! Not sure if I would recommend this for people who&#x27;ve never had a professional Brazilian, but for those experienced with the process, this is the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I am of Indian descent. We are obsessed with hair removal, but, like many &amp;#34;ethnic&amp;#34; women, we have body hair that is relatively thick, coarse and challenging to remove. I have used most methods, including threading, waxing (home and salon), depilatories, etc. In the past, I have complained that many of the home kit products out there are made for women with fine, sparsely growing hair. I would have to apply strips repeatedly to the same area, until my skin was inflamed but the hair still remained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Parissa strip-free hot wax is the ONLY product I stand behind 100%. I have been using it for 2 years. Because you are applying and then pulling off a strip of hardened wax, the hairs are embedded in there and will come off regardless of whether you pull the strip off slowly, quickly, at an angle, in 1 minute or 5 minutes after application. That&#x27;s to say - you do not need to be a professional to use this stuff. The wax comes off cleanly and completely, so there is no residue to remove on an already inflamed space of skin. It&#x27;s incredible. I now get threaded every two weeks, and on the week in between, I use this product for my upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it hurt? YES. It hurts in exactly the right way - your skin does not hurt from chafing, but the nerves around your follicales hurt like heck because you are pulling out EVERY SINGLE HAIR from the root. If you are surprised that it hurts to rip hair out from the roots, you must be deluded about how hair removal works. It&#x27;s worth it, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note: after heating it, allow it to become a little syrupy (shouldn&#x27;t be runny), and make sure that you blow on it for a second to avoid burning your skin. It&#x27;s hot wax! BUT you also want it to be liquid enough for you to spread -- so you have to figure out the happy medium between liquid and gummy that works for you. Good luck.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and does the job.</li>
    <li> I have used this product around 3 or 4 times. The first couple of times it worked great but the pain was crazy bad. Other reviewers said they had left what was remaining b/c the pain was so bad - I can believe it.  I will try other brands. When it doesn&#x27;t work it takes half the hairs or breaks off other hairs. This makes you have ingrown hairs. I went from having maybe one ingrown hair when it works to nearly a dozen which you can&#x27;t pick at because if you are a woman who is brown or darker this can leave a dark mark - not pretty to have around the bikini area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with others:&lt;br /&gt;1. This wax needs to be made very hot to work and it cools very fast.&lt;br /&gt;2. Extremely messy. It gets on the floor and it gets on you - very hard to pick off small green specks (don&#x27;t wax before a date!)</li>
    <li> Way too hard to use for me. The wax cools really fast and it hurts a whole lot when it gets stuck on you cold. I also hated the smell. It was green and smelled like a cheap pine car freshener.</li>
    <li> I really love this product. This was my first time using and it did the job as it said it would. Works well on short course hair.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this wax up in Canada, but where I live in the states, they do not sell it. This is the exact thing I buy normally and am very pleased with the buy and am happy I can now get it here</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying these for years now. The small pans are perfect for small sized areas (I use this wax to remove facial hair). These are very small pans, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them for larger areas such as bikini or legs because you&#x27;ll use it up really quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each box comes with two wax applicators and some calming oil (I&#x27;ve never used the oil).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish they&#x27;d sell just the wax (without the pan). Getting a new pan every time seems like such a waste and I never know what to do with the empty pans.</li>
    <li> It is the most effective wax I have ever used because it really does grab everything and leaves behind super smooth skin! But it hurts like hell, for me anyways, because im pulling it off so slowly.  It really only takes one application (gets all those short hairs too) and it is super easy to clean up.  I hated all the other at home wax kits because it seems to always get on the bathroom counter or my fingers get sticky, but with this wax, clean up is a breeze. It really works wonders, and my four star rating is really because im a bit traumatized by my last usage - purely my own fault for doing such a wide area all at once.    I highly recommend it though! Its the best!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. This is my second purchase.  The 4 oz package last me for about a year for lip waxing.  I find Parissa Wax easier to use and does a better job of hair removal than wax strips.  The secret is getting the wax the right consistency before applying, which for me is just a little thinner than honey.  I always do a quick temperature check by putting a little wax on my wrist before applying to my face. Apply the wax, give it a minute to harden, rip it off and then use the oil in the kit to remove any wax residue and to smooth your skin.  Just a FYI for first time users - my very, very sensitive skin is usually a little pink after waxing, so I plan accordingly. In other words, I&#x27;d never wax and then head out for work/social activities because I don&#x27;t want my freshly waxed pink skin being something that would draw someone&#x27;s attention.  I see questions about &amp;#34;does it hurt?&amp;#34; which I think are pretty funny.  After all, you are using something to rip hair off your body, so there is going to be a little bit of an &amp;#34;ouch&amp;#34; factor.  One way to reduce the &amp;#34;ouch factor&amp;#34; is to wax more frequently, so there is less hair to remove.</li>
    <li> Very good product help me a lot and really it is good for remove short coarse hair and I recommend it</li>
    <li> I am never buying this one again, horrible and didn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> I bought the wax for my lip because it didn&#x27;t require strips and had so many 5 star ratings. I&#x27;m happy to add my 5 star review as well! It was easy to use and effective. You will want to get smaller applicators for precise things like brow- the spatulas that it comes with are great for cheeks, lip, and bikini. The oil it comes with is lovely, and the wax doesn&#x27;t rip off your skin, just the hair. I will absolutely buy it again, and might buy the warmer for it so I can use it for a longer period without running it back to the stove.</li>
    <li> This is the most efficient wax I&#x27;ve ever used! I&#x27;ve bought it several times and I just ordered more. Easier to manipulate than other waxes. It removes hair from everywhere, armpits too. Of course, be sure to use a numbing agent like lidocaine, 20 minutes before you wax and it won&#x27;t hurt.</li>
    <li> Great wax. Easy to use and ideal for small areas. Much less messy than the usual strip wax. I recommend this product to anyone who waxes at home as it is the closest to a good salon wax I can find.</li>
    <li> Perfect for traveling. I thought it was going to be more convenient thought, because you need a stove.</li>
    <li> I used it on my chin...and it definitely works and easy to handle....just have to get the right thickness and apply according to instructions. The instructions really help ! I did as told and pulled it off experiencing so much pain to see my skin was cleared of all hairs in the area. I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s the minimum length of hair to get it work perfectly. But I waited until I had 1/4\\&quot; of hair and then used the product. May be I will try on smaller hairs later. It takes about 1-2 weeks for my hair to grow back...I suggest you can use this product along with threading/razer. Since it might make your skin loose with consistent use (it really sticks to your skin)..use it in combination with other ways of hair removal based on your needs !</li>
    <li> It is a good product, but I wish it was in larger amounts because that little metal pot is so small.  It does hurt like a mofo, but it gets MOST of the hair you want waxed, which is fine by me (I use a tweezer to get any stray hairs).  As long as it gets the job done.  Some reviews complain about the wax crumbling and cracking when  attempting to remove it from the body, but did it ever occur to people that maybe they are leaving it on too long?  Pull it off while it&#x27;s still a little warm to the touch and no longer tacky.  Overall, I like it and would probably buy it again.</li>
    <li> So to start off this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used wax. The pain wasn&#x27;t too bad but it left hairs and broke my entire lip out. So not only do I still have hairs my entire lip is covered in pimples. I found it to be super irrating to the skin afterwards. I can only imagine the damage it caused my skin. 😬</li>
    <li> I love this product although I&#x27;ve only tried 1 other wax by sally hansen (the natural honey wax). I will definitely buy this product again. It is only as messy as you make it. It was slightly painful (only while removing the wax), but it was worth it. I don&#x27;t know why but I had a difficult time with the other wax and I followed the instructions. I didn&#x27;t even need the vial that came with the product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is really amazing! Best at home waxing product I&#x27;ve ever used. Not having to use cloth strips makes it easy to use and there&#x27;s plenty of wax to last for a while. For small areas I suggest using a toothpick and layering the wax to the right thickness. It&#x27;s gentle on skin and the oil that&#x27;s included is very soothing and removes leftover wax easily.</li>
    <li> This product definitely works. I used to use the Sally Hansen wax strips but will stay with the strip free wax as long as I can afford the product. The wax is definitely painful, my eyes water with each use. I have been doing my own waxing on myself for awhile now though so it is bearable, barely tolerable but bearable. The soothing oil provided with it is pretty decent and comes in a pretty color and bottle. The results last for quite awhile and are noticeable right away. I tend to have some minor irritation on my chin afterwards but that happens with a lot of products even though I generally do not have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> It showed up in a cute little pan that you put on  your stove, but it ended up being too messy and too much work for me. Very sticky. I could just not be experienced with doing my own waxing....</li>
    <li> I think you definitely need a little experience to use the product in the best possible way, but once you get the hang of it, there&#x27;s nothing better! Keep practicing because the results are worth it in the end, I promise. I&#x27;ve been using it for years, as has my mother and sister, and we all love it for eyebrows and my mom for her upper lip. It&#x27;s effective and that&#x27;s worth the pain, I think!</li>
    <li> It is not as easy to use as you might think but maybe it was just me. I ended up loosing more brow than I intended. Hard to smooth it on yourself &amp; not get a lil where you don&#x27;t want it.</li>
    <li> this stuff works well for what it is, but without the warmer it is much harder to use. i tried to be cheap and use the stove but then i was going back and forth from the kitchen, and then the gel would harden, and then i&#x27;d have to go back.... it took forever!!!! once i bought the warmer, things were much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;that being said, this wax has to be used in small patches or else it&#x27;s too hard to pull off because the wax breaks, so once i am done using up this kit i might switch to cream wax with strips, instead</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use this as a spot wax for my chin hairs. Works like a charm.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m never using a tweezers again, amazing hot wax! I use my candle warmer to heat the wax, which seems to work perfectly. It did take a bit of practice, but after a couple of tries, you learn what works very quickly.</li>
    <li> This comes in a nice metal &amp;#34;pan&amp;#34; with a handle that is much less messy than the brand I have used for years.  I prefer this applicator as well, too.  There is a small glass vial of...something that broke when I opened the package and my daughter shook out the contents.</li>
    <li> Does a good job, easy to spread where you want it.  A couple of tips:  put a piece of wax paper under where you are working for easy clean up (I do mine over the covered sink) and use the azulene oil they include.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me.</li>
    <li> This wax is great!  Much, much better at grabbing hairs than other Sally Hansen kits I&#x27;ve tried.  It&#x27;s a bit of a pain to heat up and always makes a mess for me, but it does work well.</li>
    <li> My friend recommended this home use wax so I decided to give it a try. It works exceptionally well. It ripped all my hair out with one try. In fact the area above my lip worked a little too good, it hurt SO bad ripping it off. In other words it does it&#x27;s job. It is easy to peel off and does not leave a weird residue. After you use it, make sure to apply the oil included in package to treat your skin, it does help to moisturize and take the sting out of the area where the hair was removed.&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be disappointed. I think this is easily the best home hot wax treatment I have ever used.</li>
    <li> To anyone who thinks it looks cool: DONT BUY IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been waxing for many years without any problems. I bought it because I&#x27;m in the U.S and it&#x27;s hard to find good wax that you can just microwave here.&lt;br /&gt;1/ The product comes in a little pot. If you have a gas stove like me, it&#x27;s too small for it! So the wax fell when I tried to take it off; I almost started a fire in my house (not joking)&lt;br /&gt;2/ The wax has a good texture, you think it&#x27;s a success you&#x27;re gonna be fine and then you put it on your skin...big mistake! You will never be able to take it off. I just spent 20 min trying to remove it with everything I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, this is the worse thing, I ever bought in my life.&lt;br /&gt;Parissa is you are reading this comment, you should be ashamed of what you are doing! You are liars and it is a really bad quality product! I want to be reimbursed!</li>
    <li> This is better than any home wax I&#x27;ve used. I was initially nervous about burning myself, but it worked out well. The important thing is to follow the instructions included in the box. I got the Parissa Wax Warmer for use with this, and it worked nicely. I&#x27;ve only used it on my eyebrows and upper lip area so far. The wax failed to remove some hairs that were very visible and I had to re-wax the area a second time. Redness was very minimal and went away in less than 1 hour. I did get a few bumps on areas where I had to re-wax due to left over hairs, which were probably caused by skin irritation. Next time I will pluck any stray hairs or wait a few days before re-waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been about a week since I first waxed, and hair regrowth is very minimal. Overall, I highly recommend this product for it&#x27;s great value and ease of use.</li>
    <li> I am giving this a three star review because this may be an alright product, but did not go well for me at all. I have never used wax on myself before but really wanted to give it a shot. However, I really struggled to get the wax off of my skin. I read the directions thoroughly and know that leaving the wax on too long can make it harder. However, I couldn&#x27;t seem to get it right. I also still had hairs left in the area that I waxed, although I do have very thick course hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is possible that wax with strips would have been better for me, but I gave up and threw the stuff away. I will probably not continue trying to wax myself.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this particular product for about 2 years and thought it was amazing.  My recent order however, was blue (not the usual green) and it never hardens. It&#x27;s gooey, runny and sticks to everything and does NOT remove much hair at all (it just kind of gooey-ly pulls away, taking nothing with it). I&#x27;m wondering if they have changed the formula or if I got the wrong wax somehow (but in the same old box)?  The wax I received absolutely sucks and I&#x27;m uncertain whether I should try ordering again. If this is a new formula then God forbid you get this on the sink or countertop. It literally never hardens...</li>
    <li> So to start off, I just want to make this very clear. Of course it hurts. It&#x27;s wax. You&#x27;re pulling hair from your body. It will hurt.&lt;br /&gt;I gave this 3 stars for a couple reasons, I do like it. And it does work, But when I ordered this, it said it would take 3-5 business days. Well.. I got this a couple days shy of a month. I received a product coming all the way from China 2 weeks before I got this. Then to top it all off, the box was damaged. And I don&#x27;t just mean a few crinkles here and there. I mean it was totally bent, beat up and looked like it had been thrown against the wall. As I do like this product I will be ordering more, but if I can help it, I will not be buying from this seller.</li>
    <li> Very effective in hair removal...hair removal creams and other wax strips do not match it.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this... only to find out it would give me a rash on my face :(</li>
    <li> Only for EXPERIENCED at home waxing.  I had never waxed before, but read the good reviews and learned through trial n error - something I would NOT recommend.  Two precautions:   Product must be very warm, but not hot.  Test on your hand.  If it feels HOT on your hand, imagine how it will feel on your face!!! (I burned myself I two places on my chin once and had to have my doctor call in a script to heal these burns!!!)   Second, read instructions first.  Let wax sit until firm - I leave it 30 secs.  Make sure to press into skin after you apply it, but don&#x27;t begin this step too soon or it will stick to your fingers.  After 20-30 secs, pull skin taught and pull wax off quickly according to instructions.  (Similar to ripping a bandage off.) Nothing works as well as this does for COARSE, impossible-to- remove hair. Patience is the key b a learning curve</li>
    <li> Use this with the Parissa Wax Warmer. This wax is the best I&#x27;ve used. Prior to this I was using Bliss Wax. Parissa with the wax warmer works as well or better, is cheaper, AND it doesn&#x27;t mess up my microwave. I highly recommend. But you will need to get additional waxing applicators.</li>
    <li> I would rather go to the salon and pay $7 to get my eyebrows done. Not worth the money! You can&#x27;t wax your brows with this.</li>
    <li> is perfect as I wanted it</li>
    <li> It works! I have the upper lip fuzzy hair and it take it away!</li>
    <li> Love it- best home-waxing I&#x27;ve ever used.  I initially made the purchase because this company does not test on animals.  I will continue to use this brand for that reason, as well as for the performance of the product.</li>
    <li> Best I&#x27;ve used and I&#x27;ve used many waxes  definitely worth a try if you&#x27;re tired of everything NOT removing hair this is worth my time doing it definitely will buy again this is my wax</li>
    <li> I was really impressed with this product. No strips needed and I had no problem removing all the hair in one pull!</li>
    <li> scoop up some hot wax onto a small wooden applicator (e.g. [[ASIN:B0035LCSVK FantaSea Small Waxing Applicators, 25 Count Bag]]), stuff it in your nose, squeeze your nostril closed, wait a minute, and yank. Viola!  Note, I was using tweezers before this so was used to the pulling.  This was MUCH less irritating, and took 5 minutes vs 30. There was a little glass vial that broke (some kind of lotion I suppose).  Bad packaging for shipping.</li>
    <li> I got really tired of shaving all the time (I have to shave everyday because of my dark, coarse hair that grows quickly), so I finally decided to try waxing. After a lot of research, on top of sugaring, this wax was top recommended for ease of use, that it is the least painful of the waxing options, and also because it will supposedly reach shorter hairs than strip waxing. I used this on my underarms and with no prior experience, and it did great! It really does grip ALL of your hairs, even the coarse ones. Sometimes I have to spread wax on a second time as it did not get all of the hairs or I needed to spread it in a different direction. The only reason I did not give it five stars is because It can be messy. If you drip some on the counter or floor, it isn&#x27;t an easy wipe up job.</li>
    <li> It works good and it don&#x27;t take long to use it as some other wax products i used before&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Make sure you use a decent amount  so it will be easy to remove. This stuff gets the short coarse (and fine) hairs very well. Of course it hurts. It&#x27;s still waxing. Just make sure you pull it off before it cools too much and it won&#x27;t be any different than the pain of regular waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only tried this on my face. Logic does make me think that trimming bikini hair down to 1/4 inch (as suggested) would make less mess and pain. I fully recommend this for all home waxers.</li>
    <li> Great professional results.  The directions are easy to do and follow. Much better then any of the wax strips you buy in stores. Very happy with this product and will order again!  Wax comes in a small pan that you heat on the stove to a &amp;#34;honey - like&amp;#34; consistency. Includes popsicle sticks to apply wax, then wait till it cools a remove.  No cloth strips.</li>
    <li> I had spent weeks and weeks researching what could work for an issue that appeared in my 30s, unwanted chin and upper lip hairs which became more apparent and terribly annoying.  I have always been quite self conscious about it and would lock myself within the home until my next waxing appointment, I was so embarrassed.  After so many positive reviews of this, I went for it.&lt;br /&gt;I hope I can offer any relief and hope to women searching for a solution that this product is good.  It is more than good.  I finally  purchased this last week and followed the directions perfectly.  The wax does come in a little measuring cup type pot which you can heat up on the stove.  I put the measuring cup in a little skillet and warmed the wax at low heat, slowly.  Again, just follow the directions closely.  I did a test on my ankle as I was very nervous to try this on my face initially, and that area is less sensitive.  It&#x27;s a good area to just place a little wax to get the hang of how quickly it hardens and feels.  To my surprise, it was so easy and the hair came off seamlessly.  Apply it and wait approximately just less than a minute, when you can still pull up a little on the end.  Let it harden just a bit more - seconds really - and pull. The hairs come from the root.  For the lip I did one half at a time.  Same with the chin.  I was anxious for the next day to arrive as I have sensitive skin and just awaited a breakout - but nothing.  Nothing at all.  Days later I have beautiful soft skin with not a trace of reaction to the product.  In fact my hairs are growing slower than when I have them professional done with wax strips.  This product comes with a soothing oil.  I ended up using olive oil instead.  And if I can offer another tip, don&#x27;t do it on the same spots.  My first attempt I missed a few, but now I&#x27;ll know next time what to do.  No more hairs.  I am elated and have something to use in between my professional waxings.  To be honest, this is so easy and not painful - I may not have to have it done professionally again.  Thrilled.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and very effective. I am going to buy this again for sure!</li>
    <li> I thought it was like a tape at the beginning because you really don&#x27;t understand it from the pictures but it turned out to be green wax inside a metal bowl that you need to heat and melt every time. If you can do that, it works well but I just get lazy to do it every time. Probably I&#x27;ll try the tape one.</li>
    <li> Please dont hesitate to use, popsicle sticks easier than tongue depressor size is included. Purchase this product, it is great.</li>
    <li> Great wax!!! It was just awkward to heat &amp; doesn&#x27;t fit in warmer. Otherwise I would use this wax.</li>
    <li> I loved this product!! I&#x27;ve tried before hot wax with the ones you put strips over and it was horrible, so painful and messy. So I gave up and will just go to a professional, not as painful but very expensive. So for this price I said &amp;#34;why not&amp;#34;, and I am so happy I did, it is so easy to apply, wait a couple seconds and then pull!! but it doesn&#x27;t even hurt as much as it does with a professional, I am in love with it, it&#x27;s great, easy to use and it works!!!</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this, because to melt the wax, the temp needs to be really hot, and it cools &amp; gets hardened really fast too. It&#x27;s just not easy for me to use.</li>
    <li> I have horrible course hair on my jawline and neck and needed to try a new way to get rid of it. I tried a few different things including lazer hair removal that cost a lot of money and only lasted a year:( So I was back to shaving it off or tweezing it. I used this about 4 days  ago and it worked well. It did not get everything but it got most. I only have minor hair growth coming in and most of the hair that is coming back is thinner. There are sections that still have no hair coming back:) I normally have to tweeze or use a power razer daily so this is great. I am hoping with continued use it will start coming in slower. I only did used it on my neck, brow, jawline and upper lip. The upper lip is not a huge issue normally but it got all the hair and after 4 days nothing is coming in. I did have one spot that bleed a little but redness went away within 30 minutes. Brows were nearly impossible to do. The wax was hard to get on evenly. the areas I could get worked but O will not do them again. Jaw line worked great. I only have a little hair growing back. Neck was my big problem area and the area with the most missed spots. Part of that could be because it was the first area I tried and it took me a little time to get use to using this stuff. I have some hair growing back ranging from course to soft hairs but still less than normal. My neck was red for about 45 minutes and I had a few red bumps the next day but not as many as I get tweezing.  After I try this again I will post updates. I have to get a warming plate. It took a long time for this to warm up on the stove and I have to keep running back to the bathroom to use it and then back to the kitchen to warm it up again. The wax also was a little messy to use. A huge plus for me was it did not smell at all. I have trouble with smelly stuff and this did not have any. I will use again.</li>
    <li> Been waxing for 20 years. I have corse hair.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is not as good as the microwave wax I usually use.  I still have to tweeze about 50% of the hair it misses.  And you have to use a stove to heat it up.  I would rather have the convenience of the microwave.</li>
    <li> previous meds i was on caused me to lose hair  then was switched to new meds that causes excessive hair growth...everywhere...but  noticeable on face ,upper lip, chin.  never have used any sort of depilatory so i got this. what a mess..drips everywhere(it might work a little better if someone does it for you and you&#x27;re supine but my cats  have not learned to do this) it hardens so quickly and then  it was almost impossible to get off and pain ....who ha. irritated  ,irregular red patches on face.. some hair removed some not.  had put a lot of baby oil on to remove the wax also.  never again..  maybe  strips would have been less messy  but i dont care if i look like the photo of the smith brothers cough drops.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Very easy to use. Ripped hair clean off.&lt;br /&gt;Would defiantly buy again.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical but thought, for the price of one lip wax, why not? I&#x27;m of Irish/Italian descent and have very thick brown/black hair. Unfortunately that extends to my upper lip. Surprisingly this product hurt less than waxing in a salon and I had less irritation. I also didn&#x27;t have to pay for a mani pedi while I wait for the red splotch/swelling to go down so I don&#x27;t have to walk around New York City with a bright red beacon above my lip screaming &amp;#34;just waxed!&amp;#34; Just try it. Honestly, what do you have to lose but unwanted hair</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!! The older I get, the more chin hairs I get (nice, right?). I&#x27;ve used wax strips from the drug store but nothing worked. This works great and keeps me from having to get my chin waxed at the salon.</li>
    <li> WORKS EXCEPTIONALLY WELL!  No longer going to pay $15 to get my eyebrows done!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really grab the hair and had to do several applications, none of which hurt any less than the first time.</li>
    <li> It takes a little practice to get used to the no strip removal. However, it works great! I was able to wax my bikini line, armpits, eyebrows, upper lip and part of my legs with this size. There was minimal pain and no iritation. The smell seems kind of herbal, but it is faint and not unpleasant. I would definitely  recommend.</li>
    <li> Well it is waxing so it isn&#x27;t pleasant. I use it around my brows. It&#x27;s kinda hard to apply with the stick they give you but I&#x27;m not super experienced either, so take it with a grain of salt. I find that it cools while applying and I have to keep dipping and applying the same spot. As a result when I pull it off it doesn&#x27;t come off in one piece, it breaks up. It&#x27;s probably my lack of experience and proper technique. But It does rip the hair out. Would like some suggestions on how to apply so it&#x27;ll come off in one piece. Once it breaks off it&#x27;s actually kinda hard to rip off small pieces at a time. I think if I was doing larger areas it would be easier, but around the brows are super small sections at a time. Sticky strips that you could cut might be better.</li>
    <li> Klutz proof wax. Got it with a desktop heated wax warmer but you can even put the pot they provided on a stove top. Way better than Sally no heat strips, more professional and works really good.</li>
    <li> It did not work and hurt a lot.</li>
    <li> Love it! &amp;so easy to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never done home waxing before and this is very user friendly.  I followed the directions and it worked just as described.  No mess and everything you need is included in the box, even the oil for after waxing (which I really liked and appreciated).  I used this for the peach fuzz on my upper lip and the sides of my face under my sideburn area and it worked great on the first try.  I love that the wax is in a nice little metal pan you just heat directly on the stove and then when you&#x27;re done it hardens up and goes back in the box for next time.  Plenty wax for me to use maybe 15 times for such small areas if I had to guess. My only tip would be to make sure you don&#x27;t let it cool too long or it will become brittle and harder to pull off in 1 piece.</li>
    <li> Worked really great on my face... This was the first time I waxed at home and I was really shocked how much hair IT removed off my chin and upper lip....the waxed cools fast and you do have to repeat the process a couple of times or I did.... I will be buying this product again and again....</li>
    <li> In addition to the breakage of the glass in the box upon mailing; the product doesn&#x27;t work for me. disliked</li>
    <li> I bought this product with the hopes of keeping away my excess facial hair. I have PCOS, so fighting facial hair is nothing new for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say this product is the best facial waxing kit I have ever bought. It had easy to understand directions and was simple to put that in to play. I loved the fact that it was strip free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price was so good that I was worried about its efficiency, especially since I have had problems with waxing strip products in the past. It worked perfectly. Amazingly. I could not be happier with my results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips for beginners:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since you are likely to go slow as this is a learning curve, apply one section at a time then let it dry and peel it off. I applied too much to keep up with since it dries relatively quickly. By the end of peeling, the wax was harder and harder to get off. Once you are faster at applying and pulling it off, you could do everything at once (cheeks, eyebrows, chin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure there are no distractions because it really is something you need to start doing and finish doing right away. The wax has to be the right consistency then you have to apply it and peel it all quickly so you can&#x27;t get caught up in something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of the consistency, it was very easy to achieve - and I have never heated my own wax prior to this. I put it on my stove on 2 then bumped it up to 4 before removing the heat and stirring. It should look like honey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, wonderful product.</li>
    <li> This really is an excellent product, especially considering the price--it actually removes hair! Better than those strips that do absolutely nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wax is easy to heat up in provided metal container, easy to apply, and easy to peel off. The wax isn&#x27;t too hot on application nor is it that painful when hair is removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great value for the money--I&#x27;d buy it again</li>
    <li> This is the best strip-free wax I&#x27;ve ever used. And I&#x27;ve tried close to 10 over the years. This is the only one that removes EVERY hair, even the ultra fine baby hairs, on the first application. I&#x27;ve read people complain that is hurts a lot, but I must have a high pain tolerance because I didn&#x27;t find it that painful. It feels just like a regular eyebrow waxing to me. The wax heats and reheats easily and the honey-like texture of when it is ready to be used it easy to gauge. If you happen to get wax in hair you do not want to remove, apply a liberal amount of the included oil and let it sit on the area for awhile. It will eventual start dissolving the wax. And don&#x27;t rub because it will pull those hairs out! There is a bit of a learning curve in waxing your own eyebrows so I suggest getting it done by a professional a few times first. But, this product works for me and I highly recommend it for people looking to save a few bucks.</li>
    <li> I followed directions, and had ok results. Am using other products that I prefer.</li>
    <li> Easy to use if you are use to waxing. Is a little gloopy. Just make sure you don&#x27;t overheat it.</li>
    <li> I have super sensitive skin and really dark hair- so its been hard to find a wax that actually works and doesn&#x27;t cause me skin issues. This is that wax! It works GREAT! Easy to heat up, easy clean up, and I will be buying this from now on. It&#x27;s great- I recommend it for sure.</li>
    <li> 1. Yes, it&#x27;s going to hurt like a %$#@! It REALLY grabs onto every little hair and pulls it out, which is what you want. You judge for yourself how tolerable that is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Use at a consistency like thick honey. Gloop it on really thickly over the hair. You want plenty to be able to grab.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. PUT DOWN AN OLD SHEET or newspaper or whatever over the area where you plan to wax yourself. This stuff IS messy if you aren&#x27;t an expert waxer (like me), and you really do NOT want it all over your bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Even though it says \\&quot;stripless\\&quot; I highly recommend for people who are not used to waxing themselves to get some plain unwaxed strips anyway. Also, I suspect people may be right about them changing their formula that it&#x27;s become a bit more gooey...the strips helped eliminate that problem for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I will buy this again. I only wax my brows, lips, and neck. I get a very clean wax, it doesn&#x27;t hurt my sensitive skin (outside of, you know, ripping hair out kind of pain), and I don&#x27;t grow anything back for a full month. What I bought is going to last me a LONG, long time. I&#x27;m not going to get through it any time soon. So, good buy for the money, I think.</li>
    <li> Messy. Wax changes consistency after first use.</li>
