<li> I wouldn&#x27;t use any other lipstick once in the morning is all u need, u eat ,drink, it&#x27;s  still there use a little moisturizer to keep it fresh if u choose</li>
<li> While this isn&#x27;t the lipstick I reach for on a daily basis, when it&#x27;s going to be a long day or a long night, this is the one that I trust to stay on.&lt;br</li>
<li> as long it is on the market</li>
<li> She won&#x27;t use any other style lipstick.</li>
<li> and it dose not have the fruity tastes like other lip coloring you can refresh by just adding a little of the  moisture stick</li>
<li> As an African American woman, it is very difficult to find permanent lip color that matches my complexion.</li>
<li> It is hard to find 24 hour color that agree with my skin color!</li>
<li> I was disappointed</li>
