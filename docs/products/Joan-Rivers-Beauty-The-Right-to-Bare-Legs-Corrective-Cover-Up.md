      <li>This should be labeled Brown instead of tan, and would work best for a skin tone more of a African American.</li>

      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I have olive toned skin and tan easily in the summer &amp; get pretty dark, so</li>
      <li>The product certainly does stay on... didn&#x27;t completely cover marks so ?  </li>
      <li>You would come out better (and cheaper) to dab a little foundation or&lt;br</li>
      <li>It matched my complextion very well and it minimized my scars to near perfection, and it did not cost a fortune.</li>
      <li>Anyway, please double check before you buy this product that its the right color for you.</li>
      <li>have gone over it about 5 times and you can still see it clearly.  </li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t cover it completely which I didn&#x27;t expect since it didn&#x27;t say that is what it is used for</li>
      <li>It help smooth the makeup on without ur hands getting to messy.</li>
      <li>but I wanted to at least try it for the great price and it at least didn&#x27;t make my stretch marks as visible.</li>
      <li>This product allowed to me to bare my legs.</li>

<li> PLUS,  when it dries, it looks like your skin is very dry</li>
<li> Did not cover as expected.</li>
<li> Total waste of my money.</li>
<li> and it is waaaayyy too dark.  </li>

<li> It seems like the tube was not full.</li>

<li> wish it were lighter in weight for skin because it feels a little heavy.  </li>
<li> I have had a hard time trying to get rid of and hide my stretch marks after I had my daughter.</li>
<li> Which sucks, so now I&#x27;m going to try to blend it with some foundation and hope it might lighten it up some.</li>
<li> Not a good match for people of color.</li>
<li> Not happy at all.</li>
<li> And since I have already opened it up (hence figuring out it was the wrong color)</li>
<li> Ill stick to sally hansen.</li>
<li> this was a difficult product to work with.  </li>
<li> /&gt;HOWEVER, the product ( i chose \\&quot;Tan\\&quot;) is sorry beyond belief.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product allowed to me to bare my legs. Prior to this, I wore pants year-round. I&#x27;m Black with beautiful skin that bruises easily. These marks have been on my legs since I was a kid. Thanks to this product, I&#x27;m able to sashay in the summer wearing pretty dresses and breezy skirts. It took me some to perfect the application process but I love the results.  I continue to purchase periodically because I don&#x27;t want to go without this miracle product. Please don&#x27;t discontinue this life-changing solution.  I love Joan Rivers for this product and for being Joan Rivers.</li>
    <li> Did not cover as expected. Would not buy this again. Orange coloring  shipping was very fast and packaging was  very good</li>
    <li> This product was horrible.  Purchased thinking it would be the answer to spider veins....only it looked like I was wearing makeup on my legs...and my spider veins were still there....and I don&#x27;t even have them bad.  Ill stick to sally hansen.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like to dark for my skin!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product this one was just a bit dark for my skin you may want to go lighter when ordering. I reordered the lighter one and it&#x27;s perfect</li>
    <li> It was great!!! I used it to cover some stretch marks on my thighs for when I went to the water park. It didn&#x27;t cover it completely which I didn&#x27;t expect since it didn&#x27;t say that is what it is used for but I wanted to at least try it for the great price and it at least didn&#x27;t make my stretch marks as visible. My marks are bright so this cover up make them no so light colored and once it dries it made my thighs look very smooth.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, great coverage, good price.</li>
    <li> The color of this product does not do well on medium brown skin-tones.  It appears lighter when it&#x27;s on the skin.</li>
    <li> Prefer the medium, but the tan is O.K.  The medium looks more natural we think, but both are good products and we will&lt;br /&gt;continue to order.</li>
    <li> Never again will I buy this. It was sticky. Not a good match for people of color. And even on the light discolored areas I had to apply a lot of coats.  I never even tried it and went outside. Not happy at all. Total waste of my money.</li>
    <li> The product worked great loved the sponge on the end smart idea! It help smooth the makeup on without ur hands getting to messy. I will be getting more</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It covers all my permanent Knicks and marks from bike riding and also my vitiligo.  It&#x27;s a must have for me every summer!</li>
    <li> Sadly this product hasn&#x27;t worked for me due to the fact that the color you apply is labeled as tan,which is fine. I have olive toned skin and tan easily in the summer &amp; get pretty dark, so I figuring this would work. WRONG! This should be labeled Brown instead of tan, and would work best for a skin tone more of a African American. I don&#x27;t normally write reviews and am pretty satisfied with what I purchase on Amazon but not this product. And since I have already opened it up (hence figuring out it was the wrong color) I can&#x27;t return it. Which sucks, so now I&#x27;m going to try to blend it with some foundation and hope it might lighten it up some. Anyway, please double check before you buy this product that its the right color for you.</li>
    <li> I gave it a two star because I was not fully satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;It made my legs look too matt, I wish it had more of a shine</li>
    <li> the right to legs did not work for me at all I hate it</li>
    <li> covered up spots with ease! I would recommend this to anyone and I&#x27;ll be purchasing more in the future for sure!</li>
    <li> I just receeived this product 2 days ago.  The seller was fine, shipped quick, no problems at all.&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, the product ( i chose \\&quot;Tan\\&quot;) is sorry beyond belief.  I have a slight scar on my leg and&lt;br /&gt;I have gone over it about 5 times and you can still see it clearly.  The one color also does not&lt;br /&gt;blend for everyone that has darker skin.  My skin is a medium brown and it was very obviously lighter&lt;br /&gt;than my skin tone. PLUS,  when it dries, it looks like your skin is very dry but you cannot put lotion&lt;br /&gt;on top of it because it will reactivate it. It&#x27;s a mess. It doesn&#x27;t work and you are totally wasting&lt;br /&gt;your money to buy this product. You would come out better (and cheaper) to dab a little foundation or&lt;br /&gt;pressed powder in the area.  Oh well, lesson learned!</li>
    <li> Love it...great for legs with sunspots</li>
    <li> I was every disappointed with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t cover anything, not even spider veins. Like it said it would ,</li>
    <li> The moisturizer for this product caused me itching and a skin fungus as a result of it I now had to see a dermatologist. The corrective cover was recommended for the darkest of skin tones, yet it was not I looked like a walking corpse ! Did I mention this was a purchase for my wedding in July 2013, I won&#x27;t be using this or anything else now since I am now being treated for the fungus it caused. I pray it all clears up before my wedding day !</li>
    <li> I enjoy this product. It has great coverage and does not come off if you get wet. It washes off easy in the shower. Not a trace on your clothing, wait ten minutes before getting dressed and your set.</li>
    <li> Darker than some of the reviewers indicated but not darker than product was advertised.  I have both colors so I may try to mix them together and maybe get the color I want.</li>
    <li> this was a difficult product to work with.  It is difficult to squeeze and it dries too quickly. ok ok</li>
    <li> I have not used this product before, it did not match my skin tone well, but I know friends that have a lighter skin that it has worked well with. I just think they should come up with a darker tone than tan for women with darker skin tone.</li>
    <li> I got the &#x27;tan&#x27; colour and it is waaaayyy too dark.  I consider myself medium toned.  The product certainly does stay on... didn&#x27;t completely cover marks so ?  At your own risk I guess.</li>
    <li> It matched my complextion very well and it minimized my scars to near perfection, and it did not cost a fortune.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I didn&#x27;t use it for my legs though. I have had a hard time trying to get rid of and hide my stretch marks after I had my daughter. I bought the product just to try it out.....AND IT WORKED. Now I can show off my body and don&#x27;t have to worry about anybody seeing any stretch marks.</li>
    <li> The product look used and came without any company seal. Some cream was spread over the tube. It seems like the tube was not full. Dont buy this product.</li>
    <li> I broke my ankle in 7 places 2 years ago. I have terrible scars and I had a wedding last weekend and this product was great. It covered my scars with a no makeup look. Thanks!</li>
    <li> The product did not cover my stretch marks on my legs. I just waisted my money:-( .  I thought I had finally found something that worked. I guess I never be able to show my legs.</li>
    <li> Tan great for summer.  wish it were lighter in weight for skin because it feels a little heavy.  great for special occasions and&lt;br /&gt;need to wear a dress with legs showing.  service and price great.</li>
