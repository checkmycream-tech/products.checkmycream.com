      <li>It&#x27;s has a pleasant baby powder scent upon application that fades.</li>
      <li>This product gives me a tanner skin tone, so I mix it together with my lighter bb cream and it makes a perfect and accurate bb cream for me.</li>
      <li>, now I mix the two and it gives me a good match.</li>
      <li>Package arrived in good time.</li>
      <li>I do still need to blot at about 6 hours of wear, but after that I&#x27;m good for the rest of the day.</li>
      <li>and it does a damn good job for a BB cream.</li>
      <li>Price is good.  </li>
      <li>I also have fairly oily skin</li>
      <li>The makeup itself was great, a lot of coverage and a very light smell of baby powder.</li>
      <li>Love the coverage!</li>

      <li>I love the finish!</li>
      <li>and i love it!</li>
      <li>Skin Malgem face emulsion (LOVE those products!).</li>
      <li>I was a bit worried when I pumped it out, as the color seemed to look a bit more orange than the bright fit, but when I put it on it blended perfectly and matched my skin better than the Bright Fit!</li>
      <li>Etude house BB cream is my favorite and is of good quality as it smooths on nicely</li>
      <li>but whatever, to each their own.</li>
      <li>so this bb cream&#x27;s matte finish was really nice.</li>
      <li>the honey beige matches my skin color perfectly (or it just adjusts to mine skin color really well).</li>
      <li>was enthusiastic since I had been using Smashbox CC till now and with satisfactory results.</li>
      <li>The Etude House line is whitening instead, which results in a good color and is especially good for those with reddish areas (capillaries near the skin which often happens around the nose).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The honey beige color fits my complexion nicely</li>
      <li>Really liked this product.</li>
      <li>It lasts all day doesn&#x27;t change color to an orange shade either, has a nice scent.</li>
      <li>and I really liked it.</li>
      <li>It is super light on the skin, but I mix iit with my Med/deep Garneir bbcream and the color matches perfect.</li>
      <li>I have this shade in bright fit</li>
      <li>When I purchased it, I thought I was buying the Bright Fit.</li>
      <li>Best BB cream I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
      <li>I find that this BB cream is well with my oily skin, it has really good light to medium coverage that can be built up even more with concealer and a powder foundation.</li>
      <li>At first, all was well, the coverage was great</li>
      <li>but it is very light, (even the darkest shade)</li>
      <li>I really love this bb cream</li>
      <li>I love this product and will check out more Etude House products.</li>
      <li>I really love how this is more of a matte bb cream.</li>
      <li>, this is one of the better BB creams I&#x27;ve used</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure you could put it in a mini travel sized jar</li>
      <li>So Etude House, the Korean one, must be better right?&lt;br /&gt;Wrong!&lt;br /&gt;Gosh</li>
      <li>W24 was a better match.  </li>
      <li>I love this product , it is a cream</li>
      <li>However, they seem to make my t-zone more oily than ever.</li>
      <li>I love this product I will not use anything else.</li>
      <li>I love Korean BB creams.</li>
      <li>Great and fast seller</li>
      <li>Color matches me better.</li>
      <li>This bb cream is more for oily skin since it finishes matte.</li>
      <li>but I LOVE this one.</li>
      <li>Etude House is one of my favorite brands and now that I tried their bb cream, I am more in love with their products.</li>
      <li>but way better.</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;ll review them in their page as many do.</li>
      <li>and I guess it&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>I wish there were more shades but the darker one works for me</li>
      <li>Stays on a long time to and excellent cover up!</li>
      <li>but I was able to make it work which is fine...</li>
      <li>The honey color went on a scary color when I put it on my hand but then was a beautiful perfect color omn the face.</li>
      <li>or it&#x27;s great by itself for busy mom</li>
      <li>I recommend to anyone who wants to try a BB cream its a good inbetweeny one hehehe.</li>
      <li>I was nervous of getting it at first, I wasn&#x27;t sure if the shade would match, but it did!</li>
      <li>This is a huge upgrade for me and makes me feel better about going out in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;-Cotton fit&#x3D; oil control formula</li>
      <li>( I have a light olive complextion).</li>
      <li>Good coverage with one coat, slightly light for my NC35 skin but was easily fixed with a light dusting of powder foundation.</li>
      <li>It arrived on time, and it also came with free samples of products I hadn&#x27;t seen before.</li>
      <li>Its a bit too light for my skin</li>
      <li>and it even came with some free stuff.</li>
      <li>only thing I liked was that this cream has a baby lotion kind of smell which I dig.</li>
      <li>You get used to it pretty quickly, but it doesn&#x27;t smell as nice as the Skin79 BB cream that I am trying to replace.  </li>
      <li>NC35s might be able to pull off this shade but it&#x27;ll be pretty risky.</li>
      <li>At first, when I applied it, it seemed a tad bit light, but after about half an hour it set into my skin and matched perfectly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to try the Bright Fit series next time.</li>
      <li>If your skin is oily this will be great, but not if it&#x27;s dry.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not a bad baby powder smell, either.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m an NC30 from Mac, this BB cream is pretty light</li>
      <li>Etude House Cotton Fit #W24 fit my skin tone perfectly and a little amount went a long way in terms of evening tone &amp; coverup without looking caked on.  </li>
      <li>(The Japanese have their own sun protection measurement system, see here:</li>
      <li>Oil control is pretty good, got slightly oily throughout the day but with one blot I was fine.</li>
      <li>Easy to control how much you put on your face, and it comes with a pretty but not overpowering smell.</li>
      <li>It absorbs pretty quickly and it also helps improve the texture of my skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really love this bb cream I am mixed black and white, I have tan skin, I ordered the darkest one I think? It is super light on the skin, but I mix iit with my Med/deep Garneir bbcream and the color matches perfect. Stays on a long time to and excellent cover up!</li>
    <li> Package arrived in good time. Etude house BB cream is my favorite and is of good quality as it smooths on nicely and you do not even need a full pump of the product for your entire face. It blends well and feels light and not caked on like some other products.</li>
    <li> Great and fast seller</li>
    <li> Best BB cream I&#x27;ve tried so far. I wish there were more shades but the darker one works for me and I don&#x27;t end up looking like a ghost. It lasts around 3-4 hours and needs to be reapplied.</li>
    <li> Just like another reviewer stated, it has a baby powder smell, which I wish they hadn&#x27;t put in.  You get used to it pretty quickly, but it doesn&#x27;t smell as nice as the Skin79 BB cream that I am trying to replace.  Skin79 seems to keep discontinuing the ones i like, so I am trying to switch brands.  This isn&#x27;t it, though.  I found this to be extremely greasy.  My face felt like it was not breathing.  I had to lather up my hands three times to get it off of my palm.</li>
    <li> I love it! It is a little lighter than my skin tone and I definitely don&#x27;t need a full pump but I love it! Its weightless and if I use foundation over it, my makeup doesn&#x27;t look thick or &amp;#34;caked&amp;#34; on. I definitely will be buying this again!</li>
    <li> Great coverage! not oily and perfect texture.  I only need a pea size of it to cover my entire face :)&lt;br /&gt;WOULD BUY AGAIN!</li>
    <li> This is a must have. I am always skeptical of buying when there are no reviews but I&#x27;d rather buy this than an american drug store bb cream. I have this shade in bright fit and I like that one but I LOVE this one. Its a but lighter and more yellow toned. It&#x27;s has a pleasant baby powder scent upon application that fades. It also leaves a velvety finish. It isnt matte or dewy but just natural. Covers pores very well. If skeptical, just buy. The seller also included a sample of the étude house cherry lip tint, beautiful color and smells amazing !</li>
    <li> The honey color went on a scary color when I put it on my hand but then was a beautiful perfect color omn the face. It just somehow meshes with the skin. ( I have a light olive complextion).</li>
    <li> I was nervous of getting it at first, I wasn&#x27;t sure if the shade would match, but it did! I really like how it looks and the make-up is pretty big, it should last me a while. It arrived on time, and it also came with free samples of products I hadn&#x27;t seen before.</li>
    <li> This is a MUST buy. I have tried probably 10 other BB creams (both American and Asian) and by far this one is the best. It absorbs pretty quickly and it also helps improve the texture of my skin. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This BB Cream is amazing! I love it! I use it everyday!</li>
    <li> I love this product , it is a cream so the consistency is not thick, but a cream . It covers the face flawless and leaves a matte finish . I like to use this to build it under my foundation or it&#x27;s great by itself for busy mom</li>
    <li> Its a bit too light for my skin but I was able to make it work which is fine...&lt;br /&gt;But it started to break me out badly. This is not meant for dry skins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it to a friend who has really oily skin so it worked out well for her.</li>
    <li> If you are Asian with yellow undertones, the Etude House line is a good choice because unlike the BB creams available in stores in the US that use bronzing agents, Etude House does not.  Why don&#x27;t you want a bronzing agent on skin with yellow undertones?  Because the combination of a yellow undertone and a bronzing agent is a orange result that is not bronze but sickly looking.  The Etude House line is whitening instead, which results in a good color and is especially good for those with reddish areas (capillaries near the skin which often happens around the nose).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried both W13 and W24.  W13 was too light/white for me.  W24 was a better match.  Watch out that you don&#x27;t put this on too thickly because you&#x27;ll end up looking ghostly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it a 3 out of 5 because I was hoping this could be used as my only makeup and it takes a bit of effort to work it in.  It requires a bit a effort to blend into the skin, so you don&#x27;t get pasty streaks from the whitening. After that, I do need to put on a blush so I don&#x27;t look like I&#x27;ve lost all color.  Also, it&#x27;s not clear what ingredients are in this, so that makes me a bit wary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would still rate this above any other BB cream I&#x27;ve used.  However, I&#x27;ll probably stick to a light rice-based foundation, like T Leclerk&#x27;s Matte Fluid Foundation.</li>
    <li> Some bb&#x27;s leave you too glossy or Glowy or even shimmering fairyesque... not this one. Its like foundation, matte finish with all the great benefits of BB cream. I really like this BB cream... I recommend to anyone who wants to try a BB cream its a good inbetweeny one hehehe. (p.s. lots of made up words)</li>
    <li> I have a light medium skin with yellow underton. For several years I used Neutrogena skin clearing liquid foundation in honey gold but a while ago they changed their shades and discontinued the shade I used. None of their new shades matched my skin tone, so I have been trying to find a new foundation to match my skin without causing a break out and ordered this BBMcream. It is lighter than I expected but has yellow undertone instead of pink or grey, good coverage and consistency, luckily I found &#x27;Teint Idole Ultra 24H&#x27; Wear (410 Bisque) by Lancôme which is yellower than my skin tone, now I mix the two and it gives me a good match. I don&#x27;t use a powder since my skin tends to be dry when I am indoors at work in the air conditioning, out doors my skin becomes dewy not oily and no breakouts yet. It lasts all day doesn&#x27;t change color to an orange shade either, has a nice scent. I gave it four star because it&#x27;s lighter than my skin and I have to mix with another foundation.</li>
    <li> Really liked this product. I love Korean BB creams. I had been using Missha Oriental Gold but it only comes in one &amp;#34;color&amp;#34; and it didnt match my skin tone. I had read Missha Oriental Gold was one of the best (if not, the best) Korean bb creams on the market. It was nicr but it had parabens in it. No thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got one of the Etude House bb cream samples when I bought Etude House Refreshner, Etude House Baking Powder BB Cream face wash, and Etude Houses Skin Malgem face emulsion (LOVE those products!). I finally bought this one and i love it! Smooths skin out. Brightens. Evens skin tone. Comes in 3 colors. Smells great!!! And it has no parabens in it. Etude House is one of my favorite brands and now that I tried their bb cream, I am more in love with their products. I&#x27;d love to try out their other bb creams in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller I usually buy from is Rescue Warrior. They always put lots of samples with each order! And never had a problem woth packaging. But I&#x27;ll review them in their page as many do.</li>
    <li> Good coverage with one coat, slightly light for my NC35 skin but was easily fixed with a light dusting of powder foundation. I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong pink undertone, I would say it leans toward the neutral-yellow spectrum. Oil control is pretty good, got slightly oily throughout the day but with one blot I was fine. Slight breakdown around nose area but that happens with all my foundations. I love the finish! Sometimes the matte finish of my MAC foundation can look cakey and heavy but this BB cream gave a matte-ish natural finish that looked like my skin..but way better. It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on the skin, and I feel better knowing this bb cream is benefiting my skin instead of just masking it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many Korean BB creams, but have always been disappointed by how unnaturally pale they make me look. I have a medium skin tone, though I become pretty pale in the winter. even in the winter, other BB creams make me look like a ghost (even though they claimed they would adjust to my skin tone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this BB cream, however, comes in different shades. the honey beige matches my skin color perfectly (or it just adjusts to mine skin color really well). the coverage is good and can cover the redness on my face quite well, but the cream has an unfortunate tendency to slide around A LOT. I try to combat that by using concealer as a base in areas that I need the cream to stay the most and setting my face with a translucent powder. normally, I use powder to give my skin a matte finish (since BB creams usually have a dewy finish that I am not a fan of), but this one has a lovely powdery matte finish that makes it look as if you&#x27;ve already gone over your skin with powder without looking cakey.&lt;br /&gt;some people have complained about the smell, but honestly, I don&#x27;t think too strong. it&#x27;s not a bad baby powder smell, either. I really hate the smell of baby powder, but this cream smells more pleasant and you&#x27;ll get used to it and not even notice it after a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall, this is one of the better BB creams I&#x27;ve used and I will definitely purchase another one once I run out of my current tube. I&#x27;d rate five stars, but the sliding of the cream is a big con for me.</li>
    <li> I was really worried if this would fit my skin tone at first. I&#x27;m asian, but don&#x27;t have super light skin and this was the darkest tone so I got it. At first, when I applied it, it seemed a tad bit light, but after about half an hour it set into my skin and matched perfectly. I also have fairly oily skin so this bb cream&#x27;s matte finish was really nice. If you don&#x27;t know whether or not to get it, you can check out some video reviews on your tube. I love this product and will check out more Etude House products.</li>
    <li> These produce and smooth finish, provides semi-coverage without feeling very thick. However, they seem to make my t-zone more oily than ever. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s more drying? I&#x27;m going to try the Bright Fit series next time.</li>
    <li> I really love how this is more of a matte bb cream. It&#x27;s not liquidy when you put it on your face and I feel that blushes stick better with this bb cream! Plus it smells amazing!</li>
    <li> Color matches me better. I like the coverage and the texture.</li>
    <li> At first, all was well, the coverage was great and I really liked it. Then, I noticed the product would seep deeply into my skin and cause breakouts, so I stopped using it. It&#x27;s months later now and the breakouts were so deep they are only now clearing up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 1/17. Still have acne from this product. I have oily skin, yes, but I never had cheek acne before using this . . .</li>
    <li> Love the coverage! Thick for a BB cream...but doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. Doesn&#x27;t leave me shiny. Even the darkest shade leaves me a bit too pale...even after oxidizing. I use a light bronzer to add a little color and it&#x27;s perfect. Compared to Mac Primer/BB cream I actually like this product better and it&#x27;s half the price!</li>
    <li> Price is good.  Easy enough to spread on face but has a yellow undertone.</li>
    <li> This product gives me a tanner skin tone, so I mix it together with my lighter bb cream and it makes a perfect and accurate bb cream for me. Also, it gives me that  youthful look, and never settles into my pores. I tested it out with no face primer or anything and it worked just as well as it does with primer. I suggest if you are looking for a primer to put under this, use the Etude House Sun Prise Cotton Touch Powder Cream. Works great under bb cream! Also, this BB cream has a perfect application pump. Easy to control how much you put on your face, and it comes with a pretty but not overpowering smell. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is lightweight like a bb cream but provides coverage almost like a foundtion. Has a powder finish and buildable. Like it alot</li>
    <li> When I purchased it, I thought I was buying the Bright Fit. I was a bit worried when I pumped it out, as the color seemed to look a bit more orange than the bright fit, but when I put it on it blended perfectly and matched my skin better than the Bright Fit! There&#x27;s a slight smell of baby powder to it, and the finish is more matte, and less oily feeling, so I&#x27;ll be wearing this mostly during summer. The BB cream stays on the skin pretty well, especially when used with a translucent powder, and doesn&#x27;t need any touch-ups unless I touch my face a lot.</li>
    <li> Good coverage, doesn&#x27;t make my face look cakey, and there&#x27;s hardly any shine on my face so it stays matte all day. Not greasy so it helped my skin which is on the oily side</li>
    <li> I love this product I will not use anything else. It arrived in two or three days.</li>
    <li> Looks fine but it smells it little weird.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a BB cream alternative to my old Skin79 Super Beblesh (hot pink) which looked a bit gray on my skin even after oxidation and also got very greasy very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have medium Asian skin tone (not super pale, and also yellower than pink) and combination (very oily t-zone, prone to occasional blemishes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Etude House Cotton Fit #W24 fit my skin tone perfectly and a little amount went a long way in terms of evening tone &amp; coverup without looking caked on.  In terms of other cosmetics, I am closest to W3 Nude Beige in L&#x27;Oreal True Match but more yellow-toned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This BB cream definitely has yellow undertones which is perfect for people who find regular drugstore cosmetics to be too pinkish/reddish --- if you look down at your wrist and your veins look green through the skin, chances are you&#x27;ve got a yellowish undertone to your skin too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wears a long time on my face (I blot with oil blotting papers halfway through the day regardless of what I use) without sliding off, and cleans off very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While BB creams from Korea are pretty much an all-in-one in terms of makeup/moisturizer/other benefits I still use my usual moisturizer since I don&#x27;t need to put on a large amount of this BB cream for it to spread evenly and cover uniformly.  The tube it comes in has a pump which is great for sanitary reasons and is responsive enough that you can squeeze out a very small amount if that&#x27;s what you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that there&#x27;s a faint &amp;#34;baby powder&amp;#34; fragrance which I wish they hadn&#x27;t put in, but it goes away (or at least you stop smelling it) pretty quickly after application.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an NC30 from Mac, this BB cream is pretty light but it adjusts to my skintone perfectly. NC35s might be able to pull off this shade but it&#x27;ll be pretty risky. I find that this BB cream is well with my oily skin, it has really good light to medium coverage that can be built up even more with concealer and a powder foundation. My skin is very acne prone and I have a lot of acne scars. This BB cream did not cause me to break out. I would repurchase again and from this seller.</li>
    <li> BB cream leaves your face flawless and soft, I would recommend users to buy a shading a little darker than their normal skin tone. This can vary from people to people ._.</li>
    <li> This bb cream is more for oily skin since it finishes matte. I have combo skin so it shows my dry patches and makes me look cakey. The scent is floral, so it&#x27;s doable. All in all, it was eh.</li>
    <li> It has a lot of yellow undertones but a little goes a long way. Just use a little bit and it should work fine. It&#x27;s kinda pigmented and I guess it&#x27;s okay.</li>
    <li> No, not for me-I looked like a corpse.</li>
    <li> The honey beige color fits my complexion nicely (I have a &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; complexion) and it smell very good. It goes on matte, not creamy which I did not realize before. If your skin is oily this will be great, but not if it&#x27;s dry. it gives great coverage.</li>
    <li> It works great but it is very light, (even the darkest shade) so if you have darker skin you will have to use more than usual.</li>
    <li> Got the product way before the expected shipping delivery.  There was no damage whatsoever and it even came with some free stuff. The makeup itself was great, a lot of coverage and a very light smell of baby powder. Lasts for at least 10-12 hours and great for those with oily skin because it doesn&#x27;t get really shiny at the end of the day,  has a matte finish.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because apparently Korean BB creams are way better than the American ones.&lt;br /&gt;I was enthusiastic since I had been using Smashbox CC till now and with satisfactory results. So Etude House, the Korean one, must be better right?&lt;br /&gt;Wrong!&lt;br /&gt;Gosh! I had no idea that by &#x27;pearl finish&#x27; they meant that my skin would have a pale mask like covering on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I have Indian skin tone with ample number of blemishes and ageing skin. I guess this BB cream might help a bit in improving them, but otherwise, there is nothing for me here.&lt;br /&gt;I think maybe some sort of foundation over this may help, I&#x27;ll have to try it out. Alone, however, this doesn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I liked was that this cream has a baby lotion kind of smell which I dig.</li>
    <li> Intro:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a few other BB creams, but I saw this recommended on the asian beauty subreddit for oily skin. My oily skin rejected Missha, Skin79, and Dr Jardt BB creams, leading to smudgy shiny messes in only a few hours, sometimes less. Disclaimer: I hate looking &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34;. I have oily skin and it just makes me look like I need a blotting sheet and I just don&#x27;t get why anyone would want to look like that but whatever, to each their own. The koreans look great doing it, it just ain&#x27;t for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-SPF30 with PA++ (The Japanese have their own sun protection measurement system, see here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunscreen#PA_system). I&#x27;m really bad to putting on sunscreen, I usually shy away from it from past greasy experiences, but sunscreens have improved tremendously in formulas and I&#x27;m starting to become better about it. This is a huge upgrade for me and makes me feel better about going out in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;-Cotton fit&#x3D; oil control formula and it does a damn good job for a BB cream. Every BB cream I&#x27;ve tried just couldn&#x27;t get along with my oily skin except for this one. I do still need to blot at about 6 hours of wear, but after that I&#x27;m good for the rest of the day. For a foundation and for a BB cream in general, this is one of the highest performing ones I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;-Texture: It&#x27;s thin enough to blend and thick enough to provide medium to full coverage. My skin does require a setting powder though to keep it in place. Another very oil-controlling BB cream I tried thanks to the asian beauty subreddit is a Canmake BB cream but that one is really thick and hard to spread on the skin and easily accentuates any dry flakes. This one&#x27;s a lot thinner and I can get away with flaky skin a lot easier with it.&lt;br /&gt;-The pump dispenser is great for sanitary reasons and the cap is sturdy and stays on in my make up bag. A small but invaluable luxury.&lt;br /&gt;-My acne prone skin never worsens with a long day of wear with this BB cream. Missha and Dr. Jardt broke me out with a few new pimples each time I used them. Skin79 didn&#x27;t break me out, but was way too pale and greasy (Oh I&#x27;m sorry, &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34;) for me. I would hesitate to say it&#x27;s improving my skin, but there does seem to be subtle improvements in my skin when I use verses when I try a different product.&lt;br /&gt;-The shade! I&#x27;m too dark of an asian and so I was cast from my mother country to the land of West America where a lot of asians are honey skinned and wear really big sunglasses and drink boba and eat froyo for the rest of their days. I&#x27;m the Honey Beige and it&#x27;s perfect for me. I think I&#x27;m a NC25 right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-The large tube is not really travel friendly. I&#x27;m sure you could put it in a mini travel sized jar but I like the sanitary pump dispenser too much.&lt;br /&gt;-Nothing else?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict:&lt;br /&gt;This is my HG BB cream right now. Great for oily skin</li>
