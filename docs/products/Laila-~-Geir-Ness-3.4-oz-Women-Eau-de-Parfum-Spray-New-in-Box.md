    <li> When I tell you I absolutely love this scent, I used to work for Disney and I would literally go stand in the Norweign pavilion just to indulge on the fragrance. That being said, I&#x27;ve ordered this particular scent many times from Amazon and I am usually satisfied. However, if you&#x27;re looking for the &amp;#34;Old&amp;#34; style of the perfume, know that these photos are completely false advertisement. I paid the 69 dollars (which is way more than I would usually pay) just to have the original bottle (which is displayed on this site). I received the newer version of the scent (completely different bottle) and I am really upset since I paid so much more just to have the old bottle. The pics are false advertisement, DO NOT pay 69 for something you can get cheaper since they seem to have only the new bottles now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this parfum for years and absolutely love it. I always receive great compliments on how refreshing I smell. It&#x27;s not strong. Just the right mix of everything! Love, love, love it!!</li>
    <li> The scent is not the other I purchased.  Also, the scent does not last.</li>
    <li> I love the smell. Not over powering. I get complements all the time. Strangers come up to me and tell me they like my perfume.</li>
    <li> The last bottle I received from &amp;#34;Personal Fragrances&amp;#34; was NOT!  It&#x27;s my favorite perfume by far!!!  Love it, Love it Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Fabulous perfume!  Love it love it love it!!!</li>
    <li> I got the shipment fine in good shape,</li>
    <li> I received a different kind of perfume and different shaped bottle although it had the &amp;#34;Laila &amp;#34; brand written on it</li>
    <li> Product has finally arrived my wife loves it.</li>
    <li> what a great fragrance.  first smelled it at Disney. Glad I can get it on amazon. Have gotten many complements.  have purchased extra so I won&#x27;t run out</li>
    <li> When I smelled this perfume on a co-worker, it was so lovely I had to ask what perfume she was wearing! I have been very pleased with my bottle of Laila! It&#x27;s fresh and feminine, not heavy.</li>
    <li> Promtly sent!! Very pleased!</li>
    <li> The perfume smelled ok but had leaked all over the packaging so I can&#x27;t give it a high rating. It was shipped by Fragrance King who denied responsebility &amp; I couldn&#x27;t mail it back as it was leaking so badly.</li>
    <li> I first smelled this sent in \\&quot;Norway\\&quot; at Epcot in Disney.  I&#x27;ve been wearing the scent for nearly a year now, and have received multiple compliments.  I&#x27;ve also had 2 women start wearing it themselves after smelling it on me.  One remembered liking it so well that she asked me for the name of it 6 months after  we had been together.  It&#x27;s soft, feminine and memorable.  I&#x27;ve never had a problem with shipping issues.  The only \\&quot;con\\&quot; I see with this product is that it is not on the shelves of local stores.  You have to order it.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume, it&#x27;s delicious, the first time I bought it in Epcot, it was empty I had no idea where I could get it again, I wanted to come back to Epcot, but was impossible only to buy the perfume, until one day I found in Amazon, and I was finally able to find it.&lt;br /&gt;I really like this kind of fragrance, I recommend to use an all sorts of occasions.</li>
    <li> Great Article and On Time Service</li>
    <li> I loved the scent ever since I first smelled it at the Norway exhibit at Epcott. I ordered it and was devasted that the sprayer did not work. I cant use it at all unless I shake it upside down and it drips out. Really disappointing.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend for anyone with allergies.  Smells great. I bought this for my daughter because she has allergies.  I did a search on google to find the best perfume for people with allergies.  I found great reviews on this perfume.</li>
    <li> Amazing smell! Quick shipping, good price! Bought two!</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance! I first experienced it at EPCOT. Feel in love and then found it on line for refills. Was so excited o find it and have been reordering ever since. Glad I don&#x27;t have to go to EPCOT to get refills. It&#x27;s nice and light and I ALWAYS get compliments everytime I wear it! Even from strangers...</li>
