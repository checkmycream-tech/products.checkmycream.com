      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Nothing great... but better than nothing at all.... as good as other products I have used that cost more...</li>
      <li>Thanks a lot for this kind of product, Clinique!</li>
      <li>, I USED THE LIVE CHAT OPTION AND GREAT NEWS</li>
      <li>Its very good priced and overall product quality.</li>
      <li>Very good product overall</li>
      <li>This product seems great so far.  </li>
      <li>Covers somewhat, but is easy to apply.</li>
      <li>I think it does minimize the under eye circles, FYI this product is a light skin color so it does conceal while  it works, so can easily be used during the day.</li>
      <li>Buyer beware...get the laser or use a light textured concealor that does not cake.</li>
      <li>This is a free gift sample as specified on the Clinique lebel which is cover by a made up scan sticker.</li>
      <li>Very worth the price.</li>
      <li>EXCITED TO BEGIN USING THE EYE TREATMENT</li>
      <li>Though I recently started using Argan oil which I found way more effective.</li>
      <li>I was very excited to try this product and had read some positive reviews.</li>
      <li>Maybe he cant be helped :) We have yet to find a product that really</li>
      <li>, PERHAPS NOT SUCH A GOOD NIGHT SLEEP?</li>
      <li>So while its a good day to day cover up don&#x27;t expect long-term or lasting improvements/results.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products for my chronic, significant under eye circles, and had high hopes for this product.</li>
      <li>I use this as a mild concealer when I don&#x27;t want to put make up on.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t get much sleep to be honest and this really helped.</li>
      <li>I have never had any products show results this quick.</li>
      <li>I was very pleased to find it on Amazon site at a lower price than it cost in my local department store.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of dark circle corrector and this one is by far the best.  </li>
      <li>Overall, ok but no miracle in a bottle!</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s definitely worth waiting for the results to show.</li>
      <li>Good Product and came as expected.</li>
      <li>the areas but is worth using.</li>
      <li>I do not know, if this product will be useful for all people</li>
      <li>TO APPLY £73 WORTH.</li>
      <li>This really worked to fade them significantly</li>
      <li>While I doubt it is a all out cure for dark circles, I definitely think its the best thing out there yet.</li>
      <li>but sure enough she was right.</li>
      <li>This is the first product of this type that I try in my life and definetly I will keep buying it.</li>
      <li>like I did the first time.</li>
      <li>Admittedly, he wasn&#x27;t as disciplined about using this at first and the product did help somewhat.</li>
      <li>Glad you sent me this feed back because I was thinking on contacting Clinique.  </li>
      <li>I love this product, I use it on and off and can definately tell when I dont the key is the consistency.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 5-6 weeks and it works pretty well.</li>
      <li>So far I love it, I have started to notice a difference in the dark circles under my eyes going getting better</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I did not notice any difference with this product. I have used 2 bottles and I still have dark circles under my eyes. I&#x27;m not sure if it just doesn&#x27;t work for my skin since others seem to like it. I have fair, freckled skin. Clinique always makes wonderful products. This one just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products for my chronic, significant under eye circles, and had high hopes for this product. Unfortunately there&#x27;s been absolutely no change after eight months of daily use.  I even took &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;after&amp;#34; pictures and objectively there&#x27;s been no improvement. I won&#x27;t be buying another tube.</li>
    <li> Good Product and came as expected.</li>
    <li> It seems to work ok.... Nothing great... but better than nothing at all.... as good as other products I have used that cost more... Hence 3 stars...</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband who has the chronic dark circles under his eyes. He has had them pretty much his whole life. Anyhow, this product did absolutely nothing for him. Maybe he cant be helped :) We have yet to find a product that really works.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure it helps some people, we are still searching!</li>
    <li> I ordered this after seeing this product rated highly in a beauty magazine. In a couple of months, I have seen a dramatic improvements in the appearances of my dark circles. As an Asian woman who perennially struggles with the problem of dark circles, I am going to be an avid user of this product for a long time now. Very worth the price. The product has a little concealer effect as well with some shimmer, which I enjoy.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for the dark circles.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I am really not excited about this product.  I just purchased a different product to try. :(  Its not a terrible product but my expectations were not really met.  I generally like clinique products.  I won&#x27;t be purchasing another one.</li>
    <li> The metallic tip makes the difference, feels SO fresh when I put it on my tired under eyes circles. I started using it about two weeks ago and I already see wonderful results! No dark circles and no wrinkles! This is the first product of this type that I try in my life and definetly I will keep buying it.</li>
    <li> Mans best friend!! Teeny bit of concealer in this cream makes my eyes look flawless and no one will know you&#x27;re wearing it.</li>
    <li> maybe my circles are just too dark for this product, but it did not work for me. I am trying something else</li>
    <li> I have been looking around for this and was very glad that I found it at Amazon. Clinique is my brand and loving it.</li>
    <li> Very good product!!!!!!!!! Seeing results and the good thing it doesn&#x27;t bleaches one&#x27;s skin. Very good product overall i will try other products in this brand now</li>
    <li> I have always had a problem with dark circles under my eyes, and for years I have tried many, many different way to get rid of it but nothing ever worked.  I ordered this even thought I was skeptical about it since nothing has worked in the past and after a few weeks of using it I have noticed a difference. My dark circles are not completely gone but this has worked better then anything I have tried.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do much? I mean the little metal tip is cool and refreshing, but beyond that, it makes it a little difficult to control where the product ends up, and the product is thin and a little greasy. Just mediocre, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> It is an excellent product.  I use it daily and would recommend it to others.  The larger size is a better buy for the money spent.</li>
    <li> I thought for sure this cream would be effective, as I have used Clinique products for years.  However it did nothing it claimed.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Clinique under eye cream for several years now. I was very pleased to find it on Amazon site at a lower price than it cost in my local department store. It not only helps to lighten my dark circles, but is a good moisturizer under the eye.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t work.  Don&#x27;t waste your hard-earned money!  Feels great when you apply it because of the cold metal applicator, but really doesn&#x27;t work - hides nothing.</li>
    <li> I started using clinique even better eyes dark circle corrector about 2 weeks ago and I am extemely pleased with the results. I was using a lot of makeup to cover up the dark circles. I am using less and less make up now.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other products that did not produce half the results I have with this product.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have any high hopes for this product but I do use the even better skin corrector and I love it, so I thought I would give this one a try - The Even better Eyes is great! It takes a couple of weeks to see noticeable results but I definitely see a difference! I am very pale and have always had very dark circles under my eyes to the point where if I don&#x27;t wear make-up people ask me if I am ill - I have been using this product twice a day for 3 1/2 weeks and even my boyfriend has noticed that I don&#x27;t look as tired and that the circles are lightening - I think that, like with any product of this type, you need to give it time and stick with it and you will get the results you are looking for. I also love that I did not have an allergic reaction to this product. I know Clinique is a fantastic brand for us allergy prone people, and I have tried other products that give me a rash around my eyes, but this one did not cause me to have a reaction! I would strongly recommend this product to anyone who has the dark circle issue! P.S. I little goes a LONG way!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 24 years old. This product made my under-eyes DRY and the colored part of the serum seem to separate into specks on the skin. I tried using it until it ran out, but the discomfort it caused forced me to stop. A HUGE waste of money. The dark spot corrector is the same story. It heightens the problem.</li>
    <li> I have tried many things for my dark circles and now this product is on the does not work list. I used the whole tube faithfully and seen no results. Too expensive also.</li>
    <li> Clinique also has quite a broad range of products and I have dark circles under my eyes, and generally like the Clinique brand, so gave it a try. I think it does minimize the under eye circles, FYI this product is a light skin color so it does conceal while  it works, so can easily be used during the day. I think there&#x27;s more value to the concealer than the &amp;#34;Corrector;&amp;#34; at least that&#x27;s my experience.</li>
    <li> I love this product, I use it on and off and can definately tell when I dont the key is the consistency. I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I use this product all the time, buy it at Macy&#x27;s, but thought I&#x27;d purchase it from Amazon and maybe get it a little cheaper.  When it arrived, it wasn&#x27;t in the box, as it usually is when I get it at the makeup counter.  After about a week of use, I got a red rash under my right eye, got cream from the dermatologist to make it go away.  I ended up going back to Macy&#x27;s, buying the cream there and haven&#x27;t had any problems.  Sorry I can&#x27;t give you a great review on this one.</li>
    <li> Clinique is on PETA&#x27;s lists of companies that DO test on animals unfortunately, I hope they join the future soon and continue to be a respectable company</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom who wanted something for the dark circles under her eyes and I think its working very well. She likes the way it feels and her eyes look so refreshed now.</li>
    <li> Yes!! I tried this product on a whim and am so happy with the results. I have difficult dark circles, dark skin and my eyes get puffy bags. I&#x27;ve tried other products that did little to nothing or just took way too long for me to see a very small change. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but after one week my puffiness began to get better and the dark circles were noticeably lighter. After two weeks I looked tolerable without make-up. I&#x27;m on week three and I don&#x27;t look tried!</li>
    <li> I will always keep this product on board. It seems to work immediately for those under eye circles. I do not use this every day if just at home but is a must if going out.</li>
    <li> Love this product, even though it doesn&#x27;t completely cover dark circles.  Moisturizes under the eyes, and that&#x27;s very important, as well.  Covers somewhat, but is easy to apply.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product. Worked really well on my eyes. I don&#x27;t get much sleep to be honest and this really helped. Though I recently started using Argan oil which I found way more effective. But I mean yeah this does to the job too :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for awhile and still love it</li>
    <li> This works to cover up and lightens under eyes and removes the puffyness  too. Used for years.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. Has a slight colored tint which also helps counteract purpleish circles</li>
    <li> I returned it after seeing no results. This is more of a cover up than a cream for dark circles and for the cost its not worth it.</li>
    <li> I have inherited my mothers and grandmothers DARK circles under our eyes. BAGS FOR DAYS :( I&#x27;ve tried the small and cheaper products at CVS or RITE AID with no visible results. So I tried this product. I believe it said 3 months to see results so I circled that date on my calendar. I used it almost every night and morning and when that date came I can honestly say I saw results. My eyes actually looked refreshed in the morning. When I put on makeup it looked more even under my eyes than ever. A little goes a long way too. I made one bottle last about 7-8 months. When I ran out though it took me about 3 months to purchase some more and by that time my dark circles were coming back but as soon as I started the product again, I saw results again within a month. It is cheaper to purchase it on here at Amazon than at the mall like I did the first time. I will keep purchasing it online from now on. I was able to buy 2 bottles for just a little over the price of one from the mall. Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Save your money if you&#x27;re a black girl like me trying to get rid of under eye darkness passed down from your momma!</li>
    <li> it does hydrate the skin but didn&#x27;t correct my dark circle . after 2 months of use i gave up .</li>
    <li> takes a few weeks to see noticeable results, but once it kicks in it&#x27;s super impressive.</li>
    <li> This is a free gift sample as specified on the Clinique lebel which is cover by a made up scan sticker.</li>
    <li> I use this as a mild concealer when I don&#x27;t want to put make up on. I never noticed any long term differences from using it daily. But for my purposes, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product and I like it very much. Its very good priced and overall product quality.</li>
    <li> not a good under eye cover</li>
    <li> The description and packaging say that it is allergy tested but every time I used it my eyes became itchy, watery and red.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product in November and have been using daily since then. At first, I was not sure that it was helping with the dark under-eye areas but then forgot to use it for a day or two and could really tell a difference. It does not completely get rid of dark areas and must be used daily but does noticeably decrease the darkness of the affected areas. I gave it 4 stars because it is a bit expensive and does not actually &amp;#34;correct&amp;#34; the areas but is worth using.</li>
    <li> This product seems great so far.  Smaller than it looks in the picture.  It is about the size of a lipstick.</li>
    <li> these clinic even better eyes dark circle corrector,really work .i have very dark eyes circle and these really work i will recommended to anyone.</li>
    <li> I just had to have some clinique even better eyes. I&#x27;ll try anything that might help with the dark cycles under my eyes, on the sides of my eyes, on my eyelids and in the corners of my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within one week, I could tell a difference.  I have never had any products show results this quick. I was so surprised how well it worked on the dark ring around my eyes.  It worked so well, that I&#x27;m having to adjust my normal daily makeup routine.  I dont need the heavy coverup anymore.  It&#x27;s amazing and I am so DELIGHTED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You Clinique!  Love my eyes!</li>
    <li> You will have to buy several bottles of this and use it night and day for months and months before you see any remote difference. There are others that work just as well, faster and less expensive.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product twice a day as prescribed. I really like the way it is packaged for application, and after two months of use I have seen pretty dramatic results. My hereditary, scandinavian dark circles are lighter, and this Is especially surprising because im also a full time premed student, and recently left the military so those circles have staying power lol. However, im not sure why but since using this product my 30 year old fine lines and crows feet have become Much more.noticeable. I feel that this Really has changed the thin skin problem under my eyes which helps to mask the darkness but also makes the skin dry, more prone to wrinkles. I also use Benzoyl Peroxide for acne so it might be a blend of the products. Either way, im going to take a break from it for a while. But, it does what it says.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for one week now. And the dark circles are becoming less darker. I do not know, if this product will be useful for all people It&#x27;s up to your type of skin, you know? There are some people, who said that it didn&#x27;t work on them. Maybe they are correct. You need to make a test with a Clinique expert. That is what I did before using Clinique&#x27;s product. And I am very happy at the moment with my purchase. Thanks a lot for this kind of product, Clinique!</li>
    <li> I have the type of dark circles that if people see me without makeup, they assume I&#x27;m deathly ill. I was very excited to try this product and had read some positive reviews. However, while it is a nice moisturizer, the only reason it makes my dark circles look &amp;#34;corrected&amp;#34; is because it is tinted. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This product really works. It really hides the dark circle under your eyes. Eventually they get lighter so u use less of this product.</li>
    <li> this cream really works on dark circles, the tip is great and you can see as you apply it that your dark circle will clear and your eyes depuff!! I love it.</li>
    <li> Used this twice a day as directed for about 4 weeks now. I have not seen much of a change, maybe once im done with the bottle I will, but as of now it does not seem like the product works on me</li>
    <li> HOW TAKEN IN ARE WE BY THE POWER OF ADVERTISING? I DECIDED TO GO TO THE CLINIQUE COUNTER INSTEAD OF MY USUAL CHOICE OF CLARINS. THE YOUNG ASSISTANT (OBVIOUSLY SCRIPTED AND ON COMMISSION) ALSO TALKED ME INTO BUYING THE EVEN BETTER FOUNDATION AND BRUSH TO APPLY £73 WORTH. EXCITED TO BEGIN USING THE EYE TREATMENT TO HELP RID OF MY DARK CIRCLES, I APPLIED TWICE A DAY AS INSTRUCTED. ON THE THIRD DAY I NOTICED THAT MAYBE MY UNDER EYE AREAS LOOKED A BIT PUFFY, PERHAPS NOT SUCH A GOOD NIGHT SLEEP? THE NEXT DAY,OH YES, THERE DEFINATLEY WAS INCREASED PUFFINESS AND REDNESS!AS THE DAY PROGRESSED, IT GOT WORSE AND I LEFT WORK EARLY AS I NEEDED TO TAKE ALL PRODUCTS OFF MY FACE, MY FACE WAS BURNING AND MY EYES LOOKED AS IF I HAD BEEN PUNCHED.&lt;br /&gt;TOTALLY DISTRESSED I TRIED TO CONTACT CLINIQUE,GOOD FRIDAY, CUSTOMER SERVICE CLOSED UNTIL TUESDAY, I USED THE LIVE CHAT OPTION AND GREAT NEWS I WAS TOLD I WOULD BE ENTITLED TO A REFUND!! NOT GREAT NEWS AT ALL AS MY PLANS FOR EASTER RUINED. I WOULD NOT BE GOING ANYWHERE LOOKING LIKE THIS. ARMED WITH SUNGLASSES ON SATURDAY, MY PARTNER PERSUADED ME TO GO TO A DIFFERANT CLINIQUE STORE FOR ADVISE. THE MATURE LADY WAS VERY HELPFUL AND UNDERSTANDING BUT {AS I WAS) UNSURE OF PUTTING ANYMORE PRODUCTS ON THE AFFECTED AREAS. I WILL BE GOING TO A&amp;E TOMORROW AS THE PROBLEM IS GETTING WORSE.I HAVE TAKEN PHOTOGRAPHS AND WILL BE EMAILING CLINIQUE CUSTOMER SERVICES TO MAKE THEM AWARE OF POTENTIAL RISKS OF REACTIONS THIS PRODUCT CAUSES, I FEEL AS IF MY DELICATE EYE AREA HAS BEEN DAMAGED. PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS IF CONSIDERING BUYING THIS PRODUCT, YOU WILL BE TOLD THIS IS BEST PRODUCT OUT THERE WITH AMAZING RESULTS, THERE ARE ALWAYS EXCEPTIONS TO RULES</li>
    <li> This product does not eliminate the dark circles under my eyes and I did not expect it to do so.  The darkness is less pronounced and, because the skin becomes softer and smoother, concealer works well following application of the Clinique product and doesn&#x27;t settle in brittle cracks, as I would normally have with concealer.  Although not a perfect product, it is certainly worth trying.  I am a 60+ woman so perhaps a younger person using this would rate it the extra star.</li>
    <li> I think it makes a big difference and helps with dark circles, you have to go easy on how much you put on. A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Gift for my mom cause she asked for it, says she likes it, it seemed to please her, a little pricey</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 5-6 weeks and it works pretty well. I&#x27;m starting to notice a difference in my dark circles so I feel like it was money well spent.</li>
    <li> I have tried all kinds of products for my undereye circles and read in a review how well this one works.  It doesn&#x27;t overly impress me.  It helps, but it certainly won&#x27;t make them disappear.  I will keep looking for one  that will that&#x27;s less expensive.</li>
    <li> See the commercials for this stuff all the time. I have used Clinque products in the past and never really loved them, but would use whatever I bought until it was gone. I mean Clinque is pricey, figured I paid for it, use it. But this product really did absolutely nothing for me! I used as instructed for 6 weeks, 2 times a day, and dark circles are the same as they were 6 weeks ago.  Will not buy again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a terrible dark black circle under my left eye for almost 10 years - since the birth of my daughter.  Nothing has ever worked.  Concealers are out for me because I have freckles, so anything thick enough to cover the dark circle also covered the adjacent freckles, giving me obvious raccoon eyes.  I&#x27;ve used the Garnier Eye Roller for a long time, and while it really eliminates puffiness, it does nothing for dark circles.  I was using the very expensive Dr. Brandt&#x27;s cream - but while there was slight improvement, I still couldn&#x27;t go make-up free without looking like a zombie.  I&#x27;ve been using the Clinique for three weeks, and I am AMAZED!  The circle has been reduced to almost nothing, and the skin over it feels plump and healthy (which I now understand is why the dark circle was there - the skin was so thin you could see the dark muscle underneath.  This product finally addresses that!).  The product has a slight tint, which provides just enough coverage without \\&quot;raccoon eyes\\&quot;, and this week, even though I wasn&#x27;t sleeping well because of a cold, I can run around make-up free and my eyes look brighter and younger.  If you&#x27;ve given up trying to treat long-term dark circles under your eyes, try again!</li>
    <li> been using this about a month. do not see a difference. will not order again. pricey and not effective for me.</li>
    <li> Used once daily, this product helps to moisturize and helps diminish dark circles.  Not perfect but definitely noticeable to me.</li>
    <li> worked well. does not permanently correct dark circles... just works as &amp;#34;makeup&amp;#34; to make the under eye area look lighter</li>
    <li> Love the product! Fast delivery!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I think it has made a big difference in diminishing the wrinkles around my eyes. Not sure it has made much difference in correcting the dark circles though! A little pricy, and you have to use it consistently to see a change. Overall, ok but no miracle in a bottle!</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for only a couple of weeks and it seems to be doing what it says.</li>
    <li> My dark circles are primarily due to genetics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used as directed on the container for two months. No results whatsoever.</li>
    <li> So far I love it, I have started to notice a difference in the dark circles under my eyes going getting better</li>
    <li> There is absolutely NO cream  out there that will get rid of dark circles, that&#x27;s why there are concealers and powder.  With that said, this cream is so wonderful.  I have dark circles too but never expect a cream to get rid of this..  but I did expect my overall skin appearance around the eye area to improve and it has.  This cream is so delicate and soft and moisturizes nicely.  I love it.</li>
    <li> This is the only stuff that works on my dark circles.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. Been using it for about two weeks now twice a day (morning and night) and it has exceeded my expectations. I never thought I&#x27;d see such great results in such a short amount of time. I don&#x27;t even have to wear concealer on a daily basis anymore! Reduces puffiness and darkness and evens out the skin so that it doesn&#x27;t look deeper in certain spots, sort of \\&quot;fills\\&quot; it without making your eyes puffy. Also moisturizes which is a plus. The metal applicator is genius. I bought it along with the Clinique All About Eyes cream as the girl in the Clinique counter suggested. I apply the Dark Circle Corrector first and once it dries and my skin absorbs it, I apply the All About Eyes Cream. If you want to wear makeup over it you have to do this about 30 min before so that it absorbs perfectly. These products are perfect for this, as they do not cake up or ruin your eye makeup. I have been struggling with dark circles for a long time, and these finally did it for me! Thank you, Clinique!</li>
    <li> AS ALWAYS WONDERFUL PRODUCT &amp; EXCELLENT TRANSACTION. FAST &amp; EXACTLY AS SHOWN. VERY HAPPY.</li>
    <li> Been using for about 6 weeks now and have noticed a change for the better. While I doubt it is a all out cure for dark circles, I definitely think its the best thing out there yet. I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> It does not work.  It did not work for me.  It certainly was a waste of money I saw no change in my under eye circles</li>
    <li> The product does a poor job of eliminating dark circles or concealing fine lines. Moreover it leaves behind white powdery traces. I do not recommend this product at all.</li>
    <li> Not quite as good as I had hoped. The coverage leaves circles still showing. I love Clinique products, just NOT this one.</li>
    <li> I love this.  I haven&#x27;t had it that long, but I feel that the dark circles and bags have improved.  But you know, even if they haven&#x27;t, the applicator on this feels wonderful and the little bit of cover up is very helpful.  It is cool and soothing, and makes my eyes feel wonderful in the morning as I gently rub on the cover up.</li>
    <li> This product covers dark eye circles okay, but has not reduced the appearance at all.  So while its a good day to day cover up don&#x27;t expect long-term or lasting improvements/results.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he is now on his second bottle of this because it has improved his problem so much. He genetically has very dark circle under his eyes. It gets so bad that sometimes he can almost look like he has a black eye. Admittedly, he wasn&#x27;t as disciplined about using this at first and the product did help somewhat. BUT in the last three weeks he has used it religiously every morning and evening and holy cow what a difference! He noticed it and so did I! We are very pleased with this product and if you suffer from dark circles I would definitely give this a try.</li>
    <li> I contacted a couple of doctors regarding this product and other dark circle correctors.  Too bad I did not check before I purchased.  I was told in a &amp;#34;nut shell&amp;#34; that a product that claims to correct dark circles does not do anything for dark circles.  I was told of different medical problems, sun damage, heredity, stress, etc. as causes for the dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What was a  good dark circle corrector (that niether doctor did) was something they call pink laser treatments.  Buyer beware...get the laser or use a light textured concealor that does not cake.</li>
    <li> Glad you sent me this feed back because I was thinking on contacting Clinique.  Have used it religiously twice per day since it arrived.&lt;br /&gt;The product is useless, there is not even 1% improvement.  My eyes are not bulgy and the circles are not so dark or deep, this product is a farse.  I was thinking on purchasing the skin corrector but after this experience will not waste my time or money</li>
    <li> There is some improvement so I have been continuing to use it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for one week now and there are no visible results.</li>
    <li> Not worth the money, would not buy it again did not work.</li>
    <li> I purchased this eye cream and it is horrible. It made my eyes worst. I also purchased the wrinkle serum and laser focus eye cream. They all are junk. I read a review that it made another woman worst and I thought how could that be but sure enough she was right. Expensive and messed up my skin</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t really notice a difference after using it regularly</li>
    <li> The product came and looked new. It was supposed to be un-boxed but sealed. But the product was not sealed and obviously was a sanitary concern for me.</li>
    <li> Believe it or not, I can see some change here.  I was not prepared for that to happen--hopeful but skeptical.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had dark circles for 40 years, as my mother did, and I never thought I could do anything but hide behind heavy makeup. This really worked to fade them significantly it really made my eyes itch at first, but I stuck with it and within a week there was a very noticeable improvement. I now only use it once a day and I am very happy with the resulrs</li>
    <li> This definitely moisturizes and brightens the under-eye area, but I haven&#x27;t noticed a drastic difference in the darkness of my under-eye circles. I was expecting more. It&#x27;s good as a general eye cream, but was disappointing on the promise of reducing the visibility of dark circles. I noticed other reviewers complaining that it was not thick enough to cover dark circles--this product was not meant to be used a a concealer or cover up dark circles, so I have no complaints in that respect. I expected it to gradually reduce their appearance over time, which it does barely if at all.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a couple of months and I&#x27;ve seen great improvement. It doesn&#x27;t work over night but it&#x27;s definitely worth waiting for the results to show. My face overall has a better complexion thanks to it. After my tube is finished I will be purchasing another one!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this product twice a day for one month and it works very well. My dark circles reduced a LoT ! I recommend it and hope it will work as good as for me:-)</li>
    <li> Hello, my name es marianela. I&#x27;m from Venezuela, i&#x27;m writing to inform you of the following statement. I made a buy at this store, online, clinique as indicated on your sales page, this did not come. is need suggest the steps to resolve this situation. thanks and I hope that we can solve this problem</li>
    <li> Using it faithfully for weeks and no improvement. I was tricked by its good ratings in Glamour. For that amount of money I expected SOMETHING.</li>
    <li> This product is really for dark circles and not for any other eye concern, which I was ok with at first because I have a lot of sleepless nights with a baby.  It is a fluid, not a cream, with a flesh-tone tint.  The applicator is metalic, so it feels cold when you slide on the product.  While I was using it, I stopped using other eye creams, and I noticed that my crows feet were a little more noticible. Bottom line, I&#x27;d prefer something that targeted multiple eye concerns.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of dark circle corrector and this one is by far the best.  Has actually lightened the darkness under my eyes that I have had ever since being a teen (long time).  Would happily recommend this product to anyone with under eye shadows.</li>
    <li> Very pricey and didn&#x27;t deliver the results I was looking for. It does cool three area under my eyes but the coverage isn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
    <li> The product did not live up to its promised benefits. I would  not recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product does everything it advertises it will do. I am highly pleased. I love every clinique product I have ever tried. And with a money back guarantee you cannot go wrong.</li>
    <li> The package is small, but it does last a long time. I put it on every morning, but I am not seeing any reduction to my dark circles. This product adds a shine to your skin, which would work for people who have undereye shadows.&lt;br /&gt;Save your money.</li>
    <li> Now hopefully it will work!!  Got some knarly dark circles under my eyes, and I look terrible!  Word word word</li>
    <li> Yes, the product worked A LITTLE, but for the cost, I expected much more.  Will save my money, and just keep buying concealers.</li>
