      <li>Good value.</li>
      <li>I LOVED IT.</li>
      <li>Would be good as party favors or one night partying.</li>
      <li>They look great but the strands fall out VERY easily.</li>

      <li>I love this purchase.</li>
      <li>i get sooooo many comploments on them when I am out in to club.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I am glad i didn&#x27;t pay more for these...</li>
      <li>I love these clip ins</li>
      <li>These are awesome, they don&#x27;t hold much hair but look great and are pretty long, they are bright and give off slot of light</li>
      <li>The company credited my account but they were cheaply made and would recommend ordering the Glowby&#x27;s because they are much better quality.</li>
      <li>Bought in Canada (cost over twice as much) for granddaughter a year ago &amp; she loved it.  </li>
      <li>Just one more benefit to these fun sparklers :-)</li>
      <li>the seller blinkee was super great and sent me a free light up ring with my order shipping was super fast</li>
      <li>Cheap, but you get what you pay for.</li>
      <li>Worth the price!</li>
      <li>Fun!</li>
      <li>She was so excited when I gave her these.  </li>
      <li>The ones that were strait looked pretty cool though.</li>
      <li>They are fun to play with.  </li>
      <li>These hair extensions are really good for music festivals or concerts and other fun things.</li>
      <li>The lights were fun, but it did not clip well to our girls&#x27; straight hair.</li>
      <li>THANKS ALOT</li>
      <li>so I painted it black to blend in with my hair better.</li>
      <li>These hair barrette&#x27;s are not only fun, but they make it easy to see the wearer in the dark.</li>
      <li>it bends to easily so it wont lay down on you hair.</li>
      <li>I didnt particularly like the look of the bulky clear compartment</li>
      <li>I will definantly order again, seriously I will order again because I lost one at fall massive its OK this cuz they are reasonably priced and the ring they sent for free was really cool, also the baretts were name brand and did not have a butterfly shaped clip like the picture it was a plain oval clip and</li>
      <li>but when I opened the package the wires were all bent and wouldn&#x27;t bend back, some of them were bent so much that when I tried to straiten them they broke off.</li>
      <li>Not heavy, stays in place.</li>
      <li>out.this Can be fixed  by using tiny clear rubber hair ties that are found at the 99 cents store.</li>
      <li>It broke within 1 week of purchase with only modest use.  </li>
      <li>The only downside is that they are hard to stay in your hair, I have to use and extra clip, but at the end of the day they are worth it!</li>
      <li>bad product good idea.</li>

<li> I received the order folded in half</li>
<li> You can attach it to your hair in any fassion-has little clips.</li>
<li> THEY WERE FOR MY LITTLE DAUGHTER.</li>
<li> Unfortunately they fell apart shortly after I received them.</li>
<li> They aren&#x27;t dull and the colors are there.</li>
<li> They were difficult to clip in your hair due to the large size of the base, so I ended up clipping them on my clothing instead.</li>
<li> I bought these for Halloween last year and misplaced them :(</li>
<li> Crap dont buy!!!!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The item is good but watch out some of the strands fall out.this Can be fixed  by using tiny clear rubber hair ties that are found at the 99 cents store. Over all this is a grate product for a party</li>
    <li> Very cute for festivals and shows. On and off switch is best feature. Held in my hair nicely. Multicolors. Good value.</li>
    <li> Crap dont buy!!!!! it bends to easily so it wont lay down on you hair. bad product good idea. no.</li>
    <li> These hair barrette&#x27;s are not only fun, but they make it easy to see the wearer in the dark. If you&#x27;re wearing a couple of these, car drivers will have no problem seeing you. Just one more benefit to these fun sparklers :-)</li>
    <li> Cheap, but you get what you pay for. Wore them to a rave, ended up giving them out to whoever complimented me on them. Would be good as party favors or one night partying. They aren&#x27;t dull and the colors are there.</li>
    <li> These are the coolest things! My daughter wears them as much as possible. The batteries can be replaced, although we have not had to (and she wears them A LOT!) Worth the price!</li>
    <li> They look great but the strands fall out VERY easily. They were difficult to clip in your hair due to the large size of the base, so I ended up clipping them on my clothing instead. Overall, they look amazing, but just be wary of the few faults they have.</li>
    <li> I received the order folded in half so I couldn&#x27;t get them go stright. It also took for ever to receive the item.</li>
    <li> I bought these for Halloween last year and misplaced them :( Thankfully I just found them again - perfect time for this season&#x27;s festivities.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 sets but only received 1. The one set i did get are different colours, i would have preferred a matching colour pair. Waiting to see what the seller will do about the other set which i paid for but wasn&#x27;t included in my order..</li>
    <li> These were in our kids&#x27; stockings for Xmas.  It broke within 1 week of purchase with only modest use.  The lights were fun, but it did not clip well to our girls&#x27; straight hair.</li>
    <li> I use them as stocking stuffers at Christmas and along with birthday gifts.  They are fun to play with.  Will do it again.  Recommend!</li>
    <li> I love these clip ins the seller blinkee was super great and sent me a free light up ring with my order shipping was super fast and they looked great I will definantly order again, seriously I will order again because I lost one at fall massive its OK this cuz they are reasonably priced and the ring they sent for free was really cool, also the baretts were name brand and did not have a butterfly shaped clip like the picture it was a plain oval clip and the color was color changing rainbow lights I loved it couldn&#x27;t be happier</li>
    <li> I LOVED IT. THEY WERE FOR MY LITTLE DAUGHTER. IT WAS A GIFT BECAUSE THIS MONTH WAS HER BIRTHDAY PARTY! THANKS ALOT</li>
    <li> Worked all night! Still has battery life left.Nice to have on/off switch.You can attach it to your hair in any fassion-has little clips.Not heavy, stays in place.Fun!</li>
    <li> I love this purchase. i get sooooo many comploments on them when I am out in to club. I def would recommend these they have an on off button :) which is great</li>
    <li> Absolutely love them. I didnt particularly like the look of the bulky clear compartment so I painted it black to blend in with my hair better.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these for my hair but when I opened the package the wires were all bent and wouldn&#x27;t bend back, some of them were bent so much that when I tried to straiten them they broke off. The ones that were strait looked pretty cool though. after weaving it in my hair some of the wires strait up fell out of the clip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad i didn&#x27;t pay more for these...</li>
    <li> Of the two pieces received only on works the way it should. I purchased for a birthday gift 4 week prior to the birthday and I received product two weeks after the birthday. I have yet to give them to my Niece due to how cheese they are.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend looking for a different hair product and not from this manufacturer. It was not amazons&#x27; fault. It was the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately they fell apart shortly after I received them.</li>
    <li> These are awesome, they don&#x27;t hold much hair but look great and are pretty long, they are bright and give off slot of light</li>
    <li> Bought in Canada (cost over twice as much) for granddaughter a year ago &amp; she loved it.  A cousin accidently broke it &amp; granddaughter was so upset.  She was so excited when I gave her these.  Two of these from Blinkee were still cheaper than one from Canada.</li>
    <li> When these came they were defective. The company credited my account but they were cheaply made and would recommend ordering the Glowby&#x27;s because they are much better quality.</li>
    <li> These hair extensions are really good for music festivals or concerts and other fun things. The only downside is that they are hard to stay in your hair, I have to use and extra clip, but at the end of the day they are worth it!</li>
