<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> sharpest blades ever made</li>
    <li> Very nice blades. Consistently sharp and last me well over a week each. There is some glue that sticks to the blade from the wrapper, but not worth knocking off any stars. Buy these and you will be very happy.</li>
    <li> My items were delivered very prompyly. Price was excellent. and was very nicely packaged.I am a barber, and find these blades to be the smoothest when I shave my client.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You, Terri</li>
    <li> These are one of my favoriet blades - not too sharp to cause cuts</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love these blades as the price is right and they are pretty easy to find on the internet.  For me, they just didnt last longer than 2 shaves before I had to swap them out.  I have only bees using a DE razor for a few month so I am positive that it&#x27;s not 100% the blades fault but with the Perma-Sharp blades, I get 6 great shaves and goes down hill fast from there.  I&#x27;ll give them another try after a few more month of shaving with a DE as I really want to like these blades.</li>
    <li> I prefer these over Feathers. Nice close shave</li>
    <li> Fantastic blades, I would highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> Into my second 5 pack not one nick, love them.</li>
    <li> After trying several DE blades, many of which I like, this is the first blade I&#x27;ve used that I felt absolutely no razor burn at all. Not only that, but I can shave without any nicks. Very smooth shave. These may not be as sharp as a Feather, and they won&#x27;t last as long as a Feather (I get 3 to 4 shaves), but I love how my face feels after shaving with the Astra SP blades. These will be my go to blades. I haven&#x27;t tried the Astra Stainless Steel, so not sure what the differences are.</li>
    <li> Get two weeks of shaving out of each blade, better than any I have used prior.  Could actually go longer as the blade is still cutting well after two weeks.  Great blade.</li>
    <li> Excellent seller. Received package quickly. My favorite double edge razor and I have tried many. Each blade is good for at least 4 to 5 shaves.</li>
    <li> You have to use a very light touch with these as they&#x27;ll slice your face with no resistance or even pain as they&#x27;re so sharp. Not for beginners with DE shaving. Also not for razors with a narrow sweet-spot angle. Great for hard beards and experienced hands. Excellent quality-to-price ratio.    They sometimes have very large, messy drops of wax (glue?) that hold them onto their protective envelopes and that sometimes extend onto the edge of the blade; it looks like an issue, but doesn&#x27;t seem to have any effect on the quality of the shave if you simply ignore it. Cosmetically enough to make these a 4-star product, but the performance is 5-stars.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised. Better than disposables.</li>
    <li> Great blades, I change about once a week with no issues.</li>
    <li> Good blades and a good value.  Not as good as some other blades I use (Personna Med Preps, for example) but, they are less expensive.</li>
    <li> Great blade shave nice and smooth</li>
    <li> The Astra is one of my favorite double edge blades.  It is both sharp (but not as sharp as the Feather  yet comfortable and durable.  I find myself with far fewer nicks when using the Astra, but it does not get as close as the super sharp Feather.  I recommend trying either the Astra or the Gillette 7 o&#x27;clock when starting out then comparing the shave to something like the Feather.  Value wise the Astra can&#x27;t be beat.  When writing this review I also found a 100-pack on Amazon for $14.00.  Incredible deal and blows away any cartridge type of razor can offer.  I get about three-four shaves with each blade from the Astra.  Then it starts to pull a little too much.  No matter what blade you use it is important to let the razor and the blade do the work, and not your hand.  Meaning the blade should fall across your skin easily rather than you forcing or pulling the blade across your face.</li>
    <li> Typically when tuning something you only change one thing at a time and evaluate the results. I didn&#x27;t quite follow that rule, I changed two things. I was using Merkur blades and Barbasol cream. I just experienced my most comfortable shave to date, with the Astra blades and Proraso cream (no english instructions anywhere on the packaging, I hope no one mistakes it for hemorrhoid cream). Just out of the shower, with a small dollop of cream in my mug, and my not very expensive boars hair brush I made a respectable lather and set about the business of covering my face with a great smelling menthol cream. I didn&#x27;t have super high hopes for the Russian made blade compared to the German blade (the only blade I have immediate access to). Very seldom have I found a precision instrument made anywhere in the world better than one made on Germany. So this makes a first for me!! I had no razor burn. at. all. I pretty much got every whisker on the first pass, with only minor detail work on the second. I am still waiting on my Feather blades to arrive, but I am skeptical that they could produce a better experience than I just had. I really wish a US company would make a superior razor. Cost per blade, quality of shave, 6 out of 5 stars for me!</li>
    <li> Well I know they are expensive but for me and my skin nothing beats Polsilver Iridium.... But for the price I got a very very comfortable shave and I&#x27;m a little surprised with Astra . Way better than my Personna, Merkur and Feather experience.5 star.</li>
    <li> Nice smooth blade. I would give it 5 stars but it dulls out on my beard after only 2 shaves. Every one I speak to likes the blades and it works well for them.....Maybe I just got an off batch...</li>
    <li> Still new at DE shaving but these blades give me the best shave yet.  I am still a relative newbie at DE shaving but shaved a blade of some sort for 50+ years.  To be sure you need a light touch, but so far the few nicks I&#x27;ve had self-sealed without styptic.</li>
    <li> Great blades! I find them to be both sharp and smooth and for the price you cant go wrong!</li>
    <li> These are great for me. You may have to try different blades depending on the person but these definitely work for me.</li>
    <li> Been using double edge blades for about 2 years. More economical than cartridges and better shave. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Nice blades and very sharp.</li>
    <li> good blades at that price.</li>
    <li> Excellent blades!! Shipping as expected!! Bought these over a year ago and still have many left.. I go back and forth with these and the merkur blades!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product and excellent value.</li>
    <li> git thim befor the razor thats fast</li>
    <li> Great razors.  Still debating if these or the Feather Stainless I bought are better for my face.  But no matter, excellent choice for a single blade safety razor.  Double edged with perfection, and cuts like a dream.</li>
    <li> Cheap and does the trick</li>
    <li> These are now my everyday, go-to blade. They are very sharp and durable. I can get a week and a half easily out of one blade. My beard would be considered moderately heavy.</li>
    <li> This is the first time that my husband has used this  brand of blade, but he has been very happy with their performance and happy with the outcome.  Given the price, I see us purchasing these again in the future.</li>
    <li> I am only about 5 shaves in with these blades but I am not sold on them. I get a fair number of cuts. They are better than the freebie shark blades my razor came with, but I was hoping for better. When my Feather blades get in I will update as to how they compare.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m impressed.  I grow a thick beard,  and have to shave daily.  I get about 4 good shaves with these razors,  which I&#x27;m happy with.</li>
    <li> Best blades on the market!</li>
    <li> Loooooove these. I&#x27;m not planning on going back to normal razors. THIS. IS. IT.</li>
    <li> First usage was impressive. Very smooth shave. Also got more shaves with blade before becoming dull.</li>
    <li> Just as advertised!!!</li>
    <li> Placed order and received product in less than one week, Great product, blades are extremely sharp !!! New time users to double edge razors be careful.</li>
    <li> I laugh when I see those &amp;#34;Dollar Shave Club&amp;#34; commercials. I was a member for a few months. Okay razors for dollars a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I use a Merkur with these razors and I&#x27;m a member of the &amp;#34;Pennies Shave Club.&amp;#34; Not only do I save more money but I get a much, much, much better shave with high quality platinum razors than I ever did with DSC&#x27;s product.</li>
    <li> I received a new mug, brush and safety razor for Christmas. I found myself not using them because the blades that came in the set were horrible. I purchased the Astra Platinum and the problem was solved. Now I actually look forward to my shave in the morning. Sharp without removing a layer of skin and the blades hold up reasonably well to multiple shaves.</li>
    <li> What more can I say.  For the price, these are great razors. Worked well with my Parker, and Gilette,  Great razors</li>
    <li> I waited a bit to review this so that I&#x27;d have the chance to get a few shaves in. Now that I have, I can&#x27;t honestly say that these blades are any better or worse than any blades I&#x27;ve used on my DE Razor. They just work great! I get a close shave, and I saved some dollars too.</li>
    <li> Very good shave, great value. These are my second favorite blades. Fast delivery packaged well.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased a de sampler pack originally, used them and bought more....</li>
    <li> Very nice blade and it goes well with my Edwin Jagger 89 DE razor.  So far it seem I am getting about 5 shaves out of one blade.  Overall a very good blade.</li>
    <li> Good Razor Blades,  I bought from another brand before, and I feel these better than others.&lt;br /&gt;Totally recommendable. I love them</li>
    <li> So far my expereince is great with these blades.  They provide a real nice shave with not too much irritation.  Only gave them 4 stars due to the packaging.  They come individually wrapped and 5 to a box, but the boxes are cardboard and provide no safe storage of used blades.  I wish they came in a plastic pack with the used storage in the back.  That would be perfect.  The blades are nicely made and very sharp for a pleasant shaving experience.</li>
    <li> for the money, I don&#x27;t think you can beat these blades....knowing that everyone&#x27;s face is different, you may find another blade that works better for you...but if you are just starting out, this would be a great blade to try....it is well respected in the shaving community and I can get 2-3 really nice, comfortable shaves from them on a consistent basis.</li>
    <li> I got these after getting frustrated with Derby, 7 AM and Merkur blades. These blades are sharp enough to give a decent shave without tearing your face up. Sure Feathers are sharper and will give a closer shave but not without a learning curve involving nicks and cuts. Plus, a box of these runs $10 for 100 blades and Feathers are much more expensive. I got about 3-4 shaves with one blade and for the money, I was very satisfied with that durability. I can only give my own experience as everyone will have a different experience.</li>
    <li> I found these to shave my face and head very well better than the other ones  I tried</li>
    <li> Smooth, sharp, and comfortable.</li>
    <li> very nice. went with feather as my go to blade...but these were a close second if your scared of feathers sharpness.</li>
    <li> I can see why these are popular.  For me they seem the perfect balance of smooth and sharp.  They keep performing at a consistent level for longer than the super sharp blades.</li>
    <li> I have used a variety of blades and Astra rates close to the top.  I have used them in new razors as well as vintage Gilettes and they give great performance. They keep a good edge for at least four shaves before I change them out. They are also a good value blade.</li>
    <li> My favorite razors. The only ones I&#x27;ve found that don&#x27;t leave any irritation at all for me. Great price as well.</li>
    <li> Been using on face and head.&lt;br /&gt;There up there with feather which is my other go to blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: May 5 2016&lt;br /&gt;I just received another 30 pack of these blades.&lt;br /&gt;I use them with my Muhle 89 grande de shaver&lt;br /&gt;I shave my entire head and replace blades weekly</li>
    <li> I have been using Feather and 7 O&#x27;clock black for about a year now. I must say I was pleasantly surprised by the smooth and close shave of these blades with no knicks involved.</li>
    <li> my number one blade,userfrendly, sharp enough too, you shouldfell comfortable whenshaving with theseblades you can  love them f.d.please try them youwill see</li>
    <li> love using these saves me alot on those other razors that are a rip off.. one single blade can last a month depending on your thickness of hair</li>
    <li> Look no more, This razor cuts my beard like a hot blade cutting through butter. leaves no razor burn or irritation. For me this one has been the best razor thus far. I&#x27;ve tried merkur, feather, derby and this Astra razor by far is the leader!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many types. I have a rough beard and sensitive skin.  Still had a few small nicks but just as good a shave as other blades that are WAY more expensive. Glad I made the purchase.</li>
    <li> These blades are excellent and the price is very good. They provide a silky smooth shave with virtually no hair-pull and are VERY sharp. If you couple these blades with a very good shaving soap you will get excellent results. Good shaving soap makes a big difference. For the best results I avoid using cheap shaving foams that come in pressurized containers. For the price and the quality, these blades should be seriously considered.</li>
    <li> I am new to DE shaving and have tried blades from different manufacturers. I am sold on ASTRA. They last me 7 days and I do not sacrifice comfort.  Pleased with this company as well.  No postage, quick delivery, no problems or hassles. This is how a company should be run.</li>
    <li> great prices for 30 blades $6.00 I bought 5 blades from target and they cost about $5 dollars. I only shave every 2 days. These 30 blades will last me a couple of years. What a great value</li>
    <li> They are very outstanding razor blades, they provide a nice clean smooth shave and the price is just right, again thank you.</li>
    <li> Having tried a few other blades, I would say that these are by far the best ones I have used. I have a fairly stiff beard so blade sharpness is extremely important to avoid any irritation. This blade is by far the sharpest blade I have tried so far. It can make clean shave with a single pass but with multiple short strokes, you get a very close shave. The blade does not catch, or pull at all which is a testament to its sharpness. I would say that the blades last me 4-5 shaves before the blade begins to lose its sharpness, it&#x27;s still useful but I prefer to avoid any potential cuts. Comparing to the popular feather blades, these personally last me longer and don&#x27;t pull on my beard like those do. Remember that each face has its own needs and for mine, these are #1.</li>
    <li> Not the best but not the worst. I have sensitive skin but coarse facial hair.  These blades don&#x27;t exactly give me the closest shave but they don&#x27;t give me any irritation either. Every face is different .</li>
    <li> Boyfriend loved them. I did a lot of research, and couldn&#x27;t be happier worth what I ended up giving him.</li>
    <li> Great blades.  Super sharp.  Not as sharp as a feather but, for me, feathers are too aggressive.  These are just right.</li>
    <li> Tried 2 and gave the rest away to someone I don&#x27;t really like.  Wow...  Would be GREAT as box cutters.</li>
    <li> Item arrived quickly and hubby will be purchasing this particular brand of razors again - no complaints here!! Definitely happy with this purchase...</li>
    <li> I had done some research and it was rated pretty good  shipping and every thing was fine, but the blades are not as sharp as I had hope for.</li>
    <li> I found these Astra blades to be all that they were reviewed to be, sharp enough to provide a fine shave with my vintage Gillette Super Speed razor without being too aggressive.  I made two passes only using a good Williams Mug Soap for lather (which also worked very well), and got a terrific shave.  Several shaves later I tried the Wilkinson Sword DE blades and found them quite a bit more aggressive, so I returned to the Astras Platinum blades with better results - for me.  The combinations are endless as are the way different faces respond to these combinations, so YMMV more here than you may think.  Best advice is to proceed slowly, start finding out what works, and don&#x27;t be in too big a hurry to change variables without a good reason.  After all, the desired result is a good smooooth shave, so once you get to that it&#x27;s time to stop experimenting - at least for me, I have found my winning combination, and the Astra blades are it.  About the only ding that I could suggest is that there is wax or glue on the flat surface of the blades to hold the waxed paper cover in place (just wiped off), and there is no blade safe like Personna gives but these are quibbles.  Try the Astras and see what you think. (I heard Putin uses these-----LOL.)</li>
    <li> Very sharp, need a little time to master. I like blades that number sides. Helps keep track of usage.</li>
    <li> I read in some expert review that although nobody tends to single this brand out, and it&#x27;s not one of the \\&quot;hyped\\&quot; brands, that the forums continually have the name Astra come up for razor blades.  They said, \\&quot;it just seems to hit the sweet spot for a lot of guys with lots of different preferences\\&quot;...  And that&#x27;s really the best way to explain the Astra blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They aren&#x27;t the sharpest.&lt;br /&gt;They won&#x27;t rate best in any one category....&lt;br /&gt;But put the package together and somehow, it really does hit \\&quot;the sweet spot\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now.. what i&#x27;ve learned thus far in 3 months or so of wet shaving is - every component of the shave can CHANGE the entire experience of the shave.  From soaps and crèmes to razors and blades to after shaves, etc.  So it really is about trial/error and finding what consistently works for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me.. I have an EJ 89 razor and that has made my decision tough b/c that is advertised as being the razor that works EXTREMELY well with Feather blades (the sharpest you can buy).  It also works extremely well with Astras.  So I still have not been able to choose between Feather and Astra - and that&#x27;s not a horrible chocie to have.  It means 2 things.  The EJ makes the Feather as smooth/mild as the Astras.  It also means that the Astras can shave you as well as the Feathers using an EJ 89 razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think i&#x27;ve decided for the Feathers b/c you can get closer with the sharper blade- and yet with the EJ 89 razor it doesn&#x27;t feel any more dangerous or harder on the skin.  BUT I also keep trying the Astras bc that \\&quot;sweet spot\\&quot; also means they just seem to last longer or perform more consistently throughout a blades life (from sharp new to dulled old) - Astra just seems to feel and perform the same throughout.  And tha&#x27;ts where the Personnas and Feather sharper blades can fall short- they dull more quickly and thus can start feeling harsh unless you constantly replace them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in that sense.. again it&#x27;s hard for me to decide.. Feathers&#x27; vs Astras.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end.. you can&#x27;t go wrong with Astras b/c of its forgiveness.. comfort... and surprisingly really good shave.  That it feels that way throughout before replacing the blade, and may give you a couplemore shaves per blade..  hard to beat. (unless you want to go for ULTRA close with a real sharp blade and don&#x27;t mind switchign it out more often).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I&#x27;ve now been wet shaving for over 6 mos and it&#x27;s in the last 2 months that i&#x27;ve really started to &#x27;get it&#x27; and have far less irritation, much more pleasant and consistent results, and have become very smooth as a result.  The clear winner for me is ASTRA (over the Feathers..)  Any blade can feel and perform great out of the box.  ASTRAS seem to elongate that performance more than any other blade and give near-out-of-box experience even 2-3 shaves later.  NOT SO for Feather or other brands I&#x27;ve tried.  Feather is WOW out of the box but after 1-2 shaves - very rough.. not very fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have learned to not be skimpy on using wet shave products and replace blades, use more soap/creme/lather and just make the shave a pleasant/superior experience.  Even in using the product up it is still much CHEAPER than going cartridge/compressed can cremes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next phase now is trying pre-shave oil (which ironically.. i&#x27;m reading a lot that shaving oil need not just be pre-shave as an under-layer to creme/soaps - but can be stand-alone productds and potentially have better performance than soaps OR cremes (i&#x27;ve forgone cremes and am exclusively triple-milled soaps now.. but it could be that shave oils may change my mind again frmo the reviews/results i&#x27;m reading from shave oils.. again.. that \\&quot;slickness\\&quot; is THE MOST IMPORTANT part of the shave!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So ther is the longevity update.  ASTRAS are smooth, perform excellent, and seem to last longer in performance and sharpness as a blade overall than Derby, Personna, Feather, Wilkinsons.  It shaves you just as well out-of-box as on its last shave before replacing and it is THIS part, that sets it apart from the other blades i&#x27;ve tried. (and i&#x27;ve mixed them up on rotation the entire 6 mos... no more.  Astras only from now on.</li>
    <li> Very sharp but be careful</li>
    <li> Delivered as advertised and sharp as a razor!</li>
    <li> I like the feather blades more but these will still do the trick when I am waiting for those to arrive.  I can see how others like these a little more because they are not quite as sharp but can still cut through with multiple uses.</li>
    <li> great value and service</li>
    <li> After using a sample pack I chose the astra blades as they seemed to work best for my face / the way I shave. A great deal and a smooth shave.</li>
    <li> These blades were among the top 2 types I have tried.  I feel they are equal to the Feather platinum blades.  They held a sharp edge for 7 days without pulling.  I would suggest purchasing a sample pack of blades to see if you come to the same conclusion.  Best part is they are less expensive than the Feather brand blades.</li>
    <li> nice razor&#x27;s, good price</li>
    <li> I think that after several brand testings these are my favs. Thay are not expensive and come in somewhat plain packeges but who cares. The main thing is they not too sharp and they last a good week. The price is good so that they can be changed more often if one likes. One thing I like is the feedback. I can feel a positive cutting action and I can also put a little more pressure if I like with worrying about burning my skin or nicking myself. I use an Edwin Jagger razor.</li>
    <li> My facial hair grows in fast and is on the thicker side. Not to mention it kind of splays out in different directions. This blade handles all that mess with ease. I have gotten painful and sharp tugs, especially around my neck/chin area. But never have I cut my face (no bleeding). I didn&#x27;t even get razor burn from it. This is a very forgiving blade, and I would recommend it to beginners who understand the basics of using a safety razor. (IE: don&#x27;t apply a lot/any pressure!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This blade is medium-sharpness, so for men with sparse or fine hair this will be perfect for the ultimate shave. For men with thicker hair or faster growing hair, this will get you a close shave, but the stubble will pop up within 6-8 hours again. Especially if you have dark hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also the cheapest close shave you can get, since the other option is Wilkinson&#x27;s or Featherblade which are both sharper and pricier. Not to mention a little less forgiving if you apply pressure.</li>
    <li> I thought a blade was a blade, Wrong.&lt;br /&gt;These blades were superior to what I originally started using&lt;br /&gt;Great product and great shaves</li>
    <li> If you are new to DE shaving this is a good buy as they are some of the best blades.&lt;br /&gt;A 30ct should last a daily shaver with a heavy beard a few months so if you need blades I would recommend these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy the shave.</li>
    <li> Excellent blade.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to review a Double Edge blade, because each person is different.&lt;br /&gt;If you read any of the reviews for DE blades you will always see the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;All the other blades I tried were awful, this  XXXXX blade is perfect&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that&#x27;s because the right combination of blade and razor is so personal, but when you find that right combination it is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;For me it was a Feather Popular razor and the Astra blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a light beard and sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;The Feather blade that came with the razor left my face red and irritated.&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to try other blades, in alphabetical order, so Astra was first. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfection!!! For me, not you, you still have to find the right combination.&lt;br /&gt;So take all these reviews with a grain of salt and keep looking for that Perfect combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you find it your shave will be Smooth and Irritation free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got my Astra blades from DE RAZORS&amp;BLADES. 30 blades for $5 including shipping. 6 boxes of 5 blades each&lt;br /&gt;With my beard, 30 blades should last me 6 months or more.</li>
    <li> I used to use 7am blades, but these are sharper and last longer. They are not as sharp as Feathers, but those tend to give me more nicks. These Astra&#x27;s are my new favorites.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast. Great blades!</li>
    <li> In the world of double edge shaving, there are hundreds if not thousands of different blades out there. And an equal number of opinions on all these blades are out there as well. For me, these are my second favorite blades. Feathers only beat them out slightly for their consistency of sharpness. Where the Astras do better is stay stay sharper, IMO, a bit longer than the Feathers. Overall, for the price and how long they last, Astras are a great buy. Happy Shaving...</li>
    <li> Much better shave than I got with the Merkur blades I had been using for years.</li>
    <li> I love these blades!!!</li>
    <li> I have a Feather Safety Razor and use Prorasor Shaving soap or sometimes Old Tayolors Almond shaving soap and hot water.  I love there razors. These to me are equal to quality as Feathers or maybe even alittle better.  These give great shave and last a week shaving everyday. I also tried Shark Chrome razors which are good but not as good as Feather or Astra. WIth any safety razor use a good quality shaving soap like Taylors or Prorasor and use hot water to rise face before lather and during shave to rinse blade.</li>
    <li> I purchased a variety of blades to go with my Merkur 34G razor and these were my favorite topping more expensive brands like Merkur and Feather.  These were by far the best razors for the money.  I use the blades for a week and never notice any wear or difference in the quality of my shaves.  Each shave results in a smooth face with no cuts or bumps.  I still replace them each week just to be safe.  There is no reason to risk cutting my face to save a few cents.</li>
    <li> My Parker 60R came with five Shark blades -- I thought they were acceptable, but I knew that trying different razor/soap/handle combinations is half the fun of DE shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my first shave with these razors, I realize that the Sharks simply cannot compare. Smooth shave, very few nicks (for a beginner, anyway) and a great price. Very glad I pulled the trigger on these razors.</li>
    <li> For me these blades are much better than the Derby blades I first tried. The Astra sp blades are very sharp and give a smooth shave. I ordered some feather blades because I need something a little sharper than these. These blades will probably be great for most wet shavers both new and experienced. My beard is a little thicker than most and these blades should do just fine until I receive my feather blades. The reason I gave only three stars is because the the blades didn&#x27;t come in plastc boxes as pictured. Instead they came in six cardboard boxes (packs of five) and some were dented and and smashed a little because they were laying loose in a thin shipping envelope. My other issue is the the time it took to receive them. It took four days for them to ship my order and took a total of two weeks for me to get them from the time I ordered them. The blades came from New Jersey and I live in Ohio... It shouldn&#x27;t have taken nearly that long, I ordered something from China and it took about the same amount of time with standard shipping as well. The product itself is great and I rate it a three based on the misleading/poor packaging and the slow shipping. Your shipping/packaging experience may differ from mine. I would still recommend ordering these blades because of the price and quality of the blades themselves.</li>
    <li> Great blades.  I am averaging 4+ shaves per blade so this 30 count will last almost 4 months.  How much would you spend on cartridges in that same time?  Get back to real shaving with these blades...</li>
    <li> Works well.  Have nothing to compare it to.</li>
    <li> Comes in a little cardboard box, each blade individually wrapped in a waxed paper. Kinda hard to remove from paper w/o feeling like I will lose a finger. Can use blades multiple times, I like these.</li>
    <li> These blades provide for my face great results, but they dull quickly. And when they dull, I tend to apply too much pressure and we all know what that will cause. So I end up changing blades after 2-3 shaves (triple-pass), whereas I can get 4-5 triple-pass shaves with [[ASIN:B000JPMHWK Merkur-Razor Double Edge Razor Blades]] and [[ASIN:B002OCANQI Feather Double Edge Razor Blades 30 Ct]]. I do have to admit that they are very inexpensive, but if you are changing blades as often as I have to, the savings is nullified. There are a lot of really positive reviews for this brand, so obviously there is a real market for them---just not for me. I am going back to Merkur and Feather.</li>
    <li> After shaving for two years and sampling numerous other blades these will now be my go to blade. I started off with derby blades and was happy with them. I then turned to feather blades and was amazed at the sharpness of the blades. I bought the Astra blades on a whim and wasn&#x27;t disappointed. They have a similar sharpness to the feather blades and a smoothness in shaving that well exceeds both the derby and feather blades. I will be an Astra man from here on out. My only complaint is the packaging. After using feather and derby I have become accustomed to having a plastic case to hold my blades after use. The Astra use only cardboard and I miss being able to put used razors back in the case.</li>
    <li> The angle of the blades are not consistent. First blade I used I thought was awful, hardly any cutting at all. It was so bad I disassembled my handle and cleaned it with a small brush; thinking there was something preventing my but from securing. While putting the handle back together I flipped the balde over and Shazam! Out of 3 blades this has been an issue with two. Once correctly oriented they do a better job than my typical derby extra blades. I will buy again. I just hope I only have 2 duds in my batch.</li>
    <li> I bought these blades because a friend highly recommended them. I was using a Parker 96R Long Handle Butterfly Open Double Edge Safety Razor which came with 5 SHARK blades. The razor would not stay closed so I replaced it with a Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor. I also switched to these Astra Superior Platinum Double Edge Razor Blades. I used used these for the first time today and shaved as I always do, in the shower, I received a very close and SMOOTH shave. No nicks. No bumps. Smooth as a Baby&#x27;s Bottom.</li>
    <li> Love the Astra SP blades.</li>
    <li> I find Astra superior platinum blades to be less sharp and aggressive as the sharpest blades (feather) but very smooth and sharp enough for my lite to medium beard. As far as holding an edge, I can get around 5 shave from this blade more or less. I highly recommend these blades if your beard is not very course and heavy.</li>
    <li> These razors have given me the smoothest shave with the least irritation I&#x27;ve ever had.  I first tried them in a sampler pack and loved them immediately.  I actually like Feathers because they provide a closer shave (or I thought at least) but they take a  month to ship from Japan, unless you want to pay 3-4x the price.  While waiting for my feathers to ship I bought these to hold me over.  They still perform remarkably well and I would dare say they provide a smoother, less-irritated shave than Feathers.  However, I do think Feathers give a closer shave because you can&#x27;t see any stubble, but these Astras leave my face as smooth as you can ask for.  Of the 20 razors I&#x27;ve tried, I would rank the Astra #1, tied with Feathers.  The reason for the tie is that both razors provide an equally smooth, close shave.  Although the Astras seem to cause less irritation, but the feathers, being sharper, make the minimal stubble even less apparent.  So it&#x27;s your choice:  smooth, less irritated face (Astra) or smooth, less -visually- apparent stubble face (Feather).</li>
    <li> Outstanding price and outstanding blades real comfortable shave, tried Derby they are good but not near as good as Astra</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Merkur blades for several years. I decided to change things up a bit and try these Astra blades (and also Feather blades), after reading glowing reviews of both. Unfortunately they turned my face into makeup for a zombie movie. Amazon was great about it. Of course different blades will work more or less well for different people. For all I know they&#x27;re perfect for most. But they turned me into a bleeding mess.</li>
    <li> 3rd blade that i have used in my Parker Razor and i am pleasantly surprised. Price on par with the Sharks, More affordable&lt;br /&gt;than the Feathers. The shave is close and the blades are numbered for easy rotation in the razor. Thus far i can only get around 4&lt;br /&gt;shaves per, But that seems to be the average with me. They come in a cardboard box containing 5 blades a piece, not the cool plastic&lt;br /&gt;holder with with disposal slot like the Sharks or Feather but not a major problem.At around 10 dollars for a 100, they are economical&lt;br /&gt;enough for me to ditch after 3 or 4 shaves and still save more than by using the plastic disposable razor,although i must admit&lt;br /&gt;it takes me a few more minutes to prep and shave with a double edged razor. The closeness of the shave more than makes up for it.</li>
    <li> Great blades.... great deal....on time....five stars!</li>
    <li> Super fast delivery, great product. After trying a number of DE razor blades I&#x27;ve chosen to stock up on the the Astra Superior Platinum.  Super smooth, comfortable shaves, great longevity, great value.</li>
    <li> India makes good to great blades and these are my second favorite behind the Gillette Green from India in the saloon pack. These are in my daily rotation and are the only other blade I will shave with. Clean, close and not irritating.</li>
    <li> Excellent blades, much better than the merkur blades you can get in mall stores but I wouldn&#x27;t mind if they were a little sharper.  The merkur blades were causing me major irritation ATG, and tugged my lip hairs like crazy.  These are quite a bit better and the price is superior.  A bit sharper would get 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Good shave initially. But my skin is too sensitive for a safety razor. As an African-American  I have tried everything from one to four blades. They all take rhe hair off great but the period of regrowth is full of horrible razor bumps. I&#x27;ll stick to my Andis T-outliner for shaving. No more experimenting on my face with the newest razor.</li>
    <li> Many people who are new to DE shaving are told to purchase a sampler pack. I highly recommend against this as a new shaver may not have the correct technique down(I know I didn&#x27;t!) and may also run into a dud blade(very low chance, but it&#x27;s still not 0%). Not only is a single blade sampler pack bad for testing, the packs are very overpriced and the groups do not make sense with their restricted and overlapping selection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest to purchase a quantity of at least 10 or more blades from a well rounded brand such as these Astra SPs to practice your technique. These blades are very sharp and many people have obtained great results so if you end up with a bunch of nicks or irritation the fault is on your technique, even your razor or soap. Any blade will cut you if you do not use it correctly! Personally as a new DE shaver I was able to go ATG with no nicks or irritation after about 5 shaves. However that does not mean every shave after that had no nicks, sometimes it just happens when you aren&#x27;t mindful of your technique. I had 4-5 nicks allover my neck on the first shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After getting a good feeling of what is best for your face and getting better at your technique google search \\&quot;try a blade\\&quot;. Here you can create your own sampler pack for a better price than the ones Amazon or many of the sites that offer said packs. Since the selection is very diverse, I recommend brands you can find on reputable websites for a 100(or more) pack of what you may end up buying. That should help you narrow it down. 2-3 blades of each brand is a good amount to avoid duds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck with finding your favorite blades! If you have any comments feel free to add-on, disagree with me or suggest another well rounded starter blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Your mileage may vary!</li>
    <li> I have tried several blades for my thick whiskers with mixed results. I think my search is over. Every single blade has preformed flawlessly. Great quality for a good price.</li>
    <li> I chose to buy some more of these blades after going through my sampler and finding that they were one of my favorites, up there with the Feathers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say whether they&#x27;ll work for you, because everyone&#x27;s skin is different. They work well for me and they&#x27;re reasonably priced. I found the shave to be smooth and refreshing without the drag or harshness with some of the others like Derby or Shark or Bluebird.</li>
    <li> I usually use Feather blades but between their cost and that they last maybe two or three shaves, I like to look at other options. These fit the bill for me. They last several shaves, they&#x27;re almost as sharp as Feather, and overall they cost less. Will these replace Feather? Not at all. But when I&#x27;m out I definitely plan on buying more in bulk. Naturally though, YMMV.</li>
    <li> I have tried several DE razor blades and currently I am using the Astras every shave. Other razors of inferior quality have been discarded or tossed in the back of my drawer. The only blade that I have tried that is superior to the Astra is the Merkur. That is why I hold the 5 star rating for the Merkur and give the Astra 4 stars.</li>
    <li> There are so many variables to getting a close, comfortable shave with a DE that you can&#x27;t pin it on just one thing.  After 30 plus years of harvesting facial hair here is what works for me.  Using a facecloth, I repeatedly wet my face with hot water for about a minute.  A modest metal razor that has some heft to it, with a knurled  handle for a secure grip. Mug shaving soap with a decent ($50 - $100) super badger brush and Astra blades, which are without a doubt the best value on the planet.  They are sharp but not overly so and last me for a good week of shaving.  These blades can&#x27;t be beat.  Following this refined process, I stroke only with the grain of my beard.  Upstrokes simply aren&#x27;t necessary.  Finish with some Pinaud Clubman aftershave.</li>
    <li> This blades are sharp enough to get the job done. They could be a little sharper but I have coarse hair so it could just be me. Great price and free shipping to boot is awesome. The only drawback is that they come in cardboard boxes when they are clearly advertised in the nicer plastic cases that you can depost used blades in the bottom of. Only reason they get 4 instead of 5 stars.</li>
    <li> After trying 10 different types of blades, these are the best.  Smooth shaving every time and I can get five 3 pass shaves with one razor before it doesn&#x27;t feel brand new.  After 3 shaves flip the razor to the 3/4 side and it feels like a brand new razor.  Another two shaves and it feels different (but not bad).  You can probably get 7 shaves out of one razor before you feel pulling.</li>
    <li> This is the best blade/price that I&#x27;ve found.  I tried several blades before settling on the Astra&#x27;s, not to mention you&#x27;re getting 30 high-end blades for a couple bucks.  Will definitely buy again if they ever run out, 30 of these blades will last months.  I use a blade 3-4 times but could probably go 5-6, but with so many I might as well keep them fresh and sharp.</li>
    <li> O.K but not that sharp and quite heavy..</li>
    <li> Great razors.  Do a great clean shave</li>
    <li> My husband loves these razors! And that&#x27;s what matters most!</li>
    <li> They provide the smoothest shaves I have had from this kind of razor.</li>
    <li> Good blades but I prefer the feather blades</li>
    <li> Fantastically​ sharp.  I get 3 -4 shaves a blade.</li>
    <li> Good product, good price, Very FAST and REASONABLE SHIPPING.</li>
    <li> I like these blades for sharpness. I was able to get a pretty close shave, but they do not provide as comfortable a shave as I would have liked. I had some irritation on my neck wich is a problem area. So I would not recommend this for someone with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying different razor blades but found these Astra to be only OK.  I like the Personna lab blues better.  But recently have tried the Gillette Silver Blues and Permasharp blades and like these blades the best.  I have a tough beard and sharper blades give me a better shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a safety razor for about a year now.  I tried a couple of blades initially and settled on the Feather Hi-Stainless Platinums for a while.  I noticed the Astras where a little cheaper so I decided to give them a try.  The Feathers seem to be a little sharper than the Astras, but for my face, that is not necessarily a good thing.  I often nicked myself and had razor burn with the Feathers.  This has not been a problem at all with these.  I still get a very smooth shave and haven&#x27;t nicked myself once!</li>
    <li> Excellent product and speedy delivery!! I would definitely do business again!! My face thanks you!!!</li>
    <li> These blades are like shaving with ninja swords: Super sharp, and although I have been using this style razor for 8 years, I nicked myself several times. They do not last as long as the German brand I&#x27;ve been using for years. After a couple shaves it felt like it was tugging my face. Just not a match for my shaving style.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been shaving with a DE razor for 7 months, so I&#x27;m relatively new to the wet shaving world.  When I needed new blades, I decided to go for the Hattori Hanzo blade (Feather) and the Astra Superior Platinum.  I can say that the Astra blades provide a very good shave, and that I would buy them again.  I don&#x27;t have much facial hair, so mine last around 7 days or so.  I know a lot of the hard core wet shavers only use their blades for 3 shaves, but I tend to get a bit more mileage because of my scant growth.  Anyhow, I&#x27;m very satisfied with the Astra blades.  They are sharp, reliable, and a good value.</li>
    <li> Comparable to the merkur and feather razors</li>
    <li> very good close shave no ittitation,4 shaves per blade,use dove soap works just fine</li>
    <li> very sharp.good value.</li>
    <li> Consistently smooth cut. Not too sharp like some other blades.</li>
    <li> The work for me and a decent price.</li>
    <li> My favorite blade. Just the right level of sharpness for me, and the price is fair!</li>
    <li> These blades are great and can&#x27;t beat the price. Im sure there is another type that is slightly sharper but i don&#x27;t need to cut myself open. To get a really close shave i normally do 3 passes, Down, sideways and upwards. These are the first blades I&#x27;ve bought in my journey into safety razors. I can tell you though, better than the blade that came with the razor itself. Would recommend!</li>
    <li> Very thin blades, but definitely worth the money.  I would say they are more forgiving than Derby, but I haven&#x27;t tried any others so my basis for comparison is limited.</li>
    <li> not as sharp as the feathers that I got but they&#x27;re a great value and give a good shave.  Might be easier to use for the beginners like myself</li>
    <li> Good blades and a good value. Haven&#x27;t tried any others since switching to a safety razor, but these definitely work well.</li>
    <li> These work well for me.  I use them for three shaves at a time, occasionally four when I&#x27;m lazy or forgetful.  (I shave every two to three days, not every day.)  By the fourth shave, though, they&#x27;re a bit worn.  I tried the Feather and Derby brands as well and the Astra just worked the best.  I think I&#x27;ve tried the other Astra blades and they didn&#x27;t work as well as the Platinum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should mention, I only shave my neck, below the beard line.  So if you&#x27;re shaving your whole face, you may not get as much mileage as I do.  But my stuff&#x27;s moderately thick down there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t tried a variety of blades, get a sample pack.  Different blades work well for different people.  Plus, if you decided you like one blade better than the others and order that, you may still have spare blades from the sample pack in case of an emergency.</li>
    <li> Really sharp blades, sliced under my nose shaving my upper lip and didn&#x27;t even feel it till I seen the blood! So needless to say they are sharp!!</li>
    <li> Excellent--as expected!</li>
    <li> Good blades, good price.</li>
    <li> I have used about five of the thirty razors I bought.  Astra is the sixth brand of safety razor I&#x27;ve used since I started using a safety razor. I am thoroughly impressed at the closeness of a shave I get every time I use this razor.  I am also amazed at the fact that I get a consistent shave even after using it on my fourth time shaving with the same razor.  I will continue to buy this razor as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
    <li> Excellent blades, especially for the money.</li>
    <li> I have really sensitive skin, but these blades took it easy on me, but still gave me a great shave. Have these in my Edwin jagger DE87 , very very good.</li>
    <li> I can compare it to the Wilkinson Sword that I used many many years ago. You mileage may vary; I have been using the first blade for a month now. Completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> My husband is a huge fan of feather blades and these got such great reviews he decided to give them a try.  Suffice to say, he swears they are on par with feather, gets a marvelous shave and less expensive.</li>
    <li> Very good nice clean, close shave. but them don&#x27;t last as long as Shark or feather. but still a nice blade.</li>
    <li> Great product..it is good quality for the price.  Will be purchasing more of the blades when I run out, which will be months away, since one blade last a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> Got the razor blades but no razor?</li>
    <li> I probably would have given these 5 stars if I wrote the review before trying Feather blades. However, this is a strong 4 stars. Astra has been my main blade for a month, which is about how long I have been DE shaving. I tried Derby which were not so great, and Gillette which were on par with the Astra. I get a smooth shave every time with Astra and one blade usually hold up very well for three shaves in which I make 2 to 3 passes. I have to make 2 minimum, and 3 if I want perfection. I found Feather blades require only 1 pass to equal that of the Astra and Gillette, however I still do 2 passes anyway just to be sure I didn&#x27;t miss anything. I have never had a closer shave than with Feather, yet the Astra blades do not leave me complaining by any means, just not quite as close. For the price these are a great buy. One more thing to mention, these came in cardboard boxes of 5 per box, instead of the nicer plastic boxes of 5 each like the Derby and Feather blades I bought. I like the plastic box because it doesn&#x27;t hurt if it gets wet and it is easier to slide a blade out when you need one. Plus, you can put the old blades back in it when you&#x27;re done for safer disposal (tape the ends of the box). All in all I rank these 2nd best, just behind Feather.</li>
    <li> A pretty good choice for razor blades. Haven&#x27;t had a problem yet. Quality is pretty good and the edge is sharp.</li>
    <li> I am using these blades with a Merkur Safety Razor Model 180.  Before I was using the Merkur Double Edge Safety Razor blades, but the Astra blades work much better for me.  They are extremely smooth and allow me to get a very close shave without any nicks, cuts or razor burn (zero bleeding in the first week with a brand new blade).  In my second week now and still using the first Astra blade.  Even my Monday morning stubble (after not shaving Saturday and Sunday) was no problem with this blade, although I had already used it for five shaves last week.  Closest shaves I have ever managed to get!  Even shaving across or against the grain is no issue for me.  I have 30 Astra blades, so they will last me at least a year if not longer.  I have not used any other blades besides Merkur and Astra, but for now I believe I have found my favorite blades.  I actually look forward to shaving now!</li>
    <li> Great blades.  Excellent price and they don&#x27;t nick easily.  Very sharp and work very well.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re blades. They&#x27;re sharp. They cut. That&#x27;s what blades do.</li>
    <li> Great blades for the price. Will definitely order more when the time comes</li>
    <li> Sharp blades at a good price.</li>
    <li> delivery was as promised, the product is great an inexpensive high quality blade.</li>
    <li> These blades are great for the $. But me personally prefer a thicker blade for those stubborn hairs. These are a tad on the thin side, perfect if you have softer bristles. But now that I know this, I&#x27;m still happy with my purchase. Just not for everyone though. They are however some of the sharper blades out there though.</li>
    <li> These blades are awesome. I wanted to try these before I fully commit to the 100 pack. So far its between Feather and these Astra. I need to circle back on the feathers blades but I was finding them too sharp. These blades leave me baby butt smooth with zero irritation and are almost half the price of feathers.</li>
    <li> I purchased a safety razor, badger brush, some TOBS, and several different kinds of blades. I decided to give the Austra blades a try for my first attempt at shaving with a safety razor. These blades are very sharp and worked very well for me they just glide down my face and slice the whiskers away! So far so good! I did not slice my face off!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong Feather blades are good but Astra Superior Platinum gives more of a smooth glide and cuts just as close for me so that makes it a great razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Feather and Israeli Red Personna for years but wanted to try these Astras based on very good reviews. Like most DE shavers I have  more than one razor and like to rotate them and the blades. I find these blades work great in my Futur. I get a nice smooth and close shave. Usually toss after third shave with my tough beard and I prevent tugging. Would recommend to all DE shavers.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut properly and leaves the beard still attached, which can be annoying. I have to go through same place multiple times to shave it off. There is a lot of blades that&#x27;s the pro side but the fact that I have to do extra amount of work is time consuming and annoying.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Packaging could be better, but the blades are definately just what I was looking for. Very sharp, smooth shave.... Lasts longer than was expected between changing blades, nice bonus!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much irritation with these blades at all, but the shave also was not very close.  I would say they are fine if you want to look presentable and be comfortable, but if you are getting close enough someone is touching your face, they will notice the stubble.</li>
    <li> Each blade is wrapped individually in paper.  5 wrapped blades come in a stack, each stack in a box sized to fit the stack itself, for a total of 6 boxes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I (and my face) feel these blades are really nice. They give a shave close enough for my liking, yet do not require perfect shaving technique to avoid burn and cuts. I&#x27;m still relatively new to DE shaving, so having this &amp;#34;forgiveness&amp;#34; to help me improve my technique without having to be perfect is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My razor originally came packaged with Derby brand blades, but I had heard that many appreciated Astra SP better.  While the Derby is a fine blade, I feel these are a bit better.  It may be due to more practice, but I feel these give a bit closer shave, but still forgive inconsistent technique without cuts or burn.</li>
    <li> These blades are sharp but not overly aggressive.  They worked well in the Parker 99R that I bought along with the blades.  I am new to DE shaving so I did nick my face a couple times.  I believe this had to do more with my technique rather a fault with the blades or razor.  I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> These blades work great in my Edwin razor. They cut close without irritating my skin.</li>
    <li> Simply not sharp enough for my rough scruff. Maybe it&#x27;s good for you, though. And six more words are required for this review...</li>
    <li> I think the 5-blade Fusion is superb.</li>
    <li> I shaved my face but left many cuts. I prefer either the shark blades and my favorite the feather DES Razors.</li>
    <li> Need I say more? I was a bloody mess after trying 1 of these blades. I&#x27;m going to use em as exacto blades(put tape over one side) cause they will never touch my face again!!</li>
    <li> I like the blades..... Nice, sharp, and consistent. A little hiccup with USPS dropping the ball, but they went waaaay above and beyond to make it right. So the blades are a 5 star because their good, but I would give their team 6 stars for what she did to make sure things were taken care of. Absolutely amazing customer service. Would buy again, because I like the blades, but even more so knowing their Customer Support is second to none.</li>
    <li> these blades work much better than cheap disposable razors.I would recommend buying this product.the old safety razor is still the best.</li>
    <li> Pretty good for 2 shaves, on the third the tug and pull kicks in. at 4 their horrible.  However they arent that expensive so Ill keep using em</li>
    <li> Meh.  Not as sharp as other blades I&#x27;ve tried in the same price range.</li>
    <li> Finally found the perfect combination.  Use a merkur 180 and the astra blade and it gives me areally good, close, and nick free shave.  Took me about 3 months of searching to find the right combination but it was well worth the search</li>
    <li> Happy with these blades in my Lord L6 DE razor. Very sharp and hold edge well. I use DE to shave my head and when I let it go for  week or two these blades remove hair without an issue</li>
    <li> Four stars for the razor, one star for the seller.&lt;br /&gt;-These don&#x27;t come in the nice hard plastic shell as depicted in the picture. False advertising. They come in paper boxes that are all crushed by the time you receive them.&lt;br /&gt;-Not as sharp as feathers. Not as good. But sharper than most blades, and if you don&#x27;t need something as sharp as Feathers then this may be the blade for you.</li>
    <li> A good product at a decent price.  The product was well packaged and arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Seem to be the best of the three that I tried including Derby and Shark.</li>
    <li> I have been trying multiple blades and after trying the Astra blades I will be a repeat customer. With both my micro touch one and Pearl sbf-15 I recieve a close shave.</li>
    <li> They work very well for me. I am going to try some Feather blades in the future, but these give me a nice close shave.</li>
    <li> I thought i&#x27;d never run out of these blades, i got at least 2-3 shaves out of each blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;alas the time has come to order more..  and thank god i&#x27;m not using those plastic fabricated blades from wallgreens anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;what a relief..  I enjoy shaving again.</li>
    <li> These blades are just fine. Not as sharp as Feathers (that&#x27;s a good thing to me - I cut myself constantly with those things), not as dull as Derbys. Similar to Persona Reds, I&#x27;d say. This is also a great deal. If you need a bunch of quality razors for cheap, consider grabbing these. Note: these are just cardboard boxes of razors (not the bulky plastic ones). Therefore, there is no built-in razor disposal on the back, as there is when you buy the dispensers individually. Make sure you have a safe place to store used razors!</li>
    <li> Love these razor blades. Very sharp, very consistent razors. I use these in a Lord Premium razor and they work beautifully. I was using the Lord blades that came with myrazorand when i ran out i ordered these and they are far sharper and stay sharper longer than the Lord blades. And the fact theat they are the Russian counterpart of Gillette means they are going to be a great product! Amazing deal with these 30 packs!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Feather blades since I started using safety razors, but found them a bit to aggressive for my taste. I&#x27;ve heard a lot of positive remarks about these, so decided to pick up a couple to test out. I&#x27;ve used these blades once for 3 passes and I have to say that I&#x27;m impressed. They seemed vary sharp but yet weren&#x27;t to aggressive. I would consider these to be a moderate razor that are fairly sharp. I&#x27;ll continue to buy Astra blades now.</li>
    <li> Have tried a lot of different brands of DE razors and these are my goto blades.  Give them a shot!</li>
    <li> Took matters into my own hands and did a comparison test of Astra, Feather, Persona and Wilkinson blades on my tough beard. The following criteria was adhered to:&lt;br /&gt;1.) shaved every other day&lt;br /&gt;2.) used the same brush&lt;br /&gt;3.) used the same shaving cream&lt;br /&gt;4.) used the same double edge Mehaz razor&lt;br /&gt;Results: The Feather is the sharpest of the blades, a little too sharp for my liking, it is very easy to cut yourself with them.&lt;br /&gt;  The other three contenders were comparable in sharpness. All four brands in the test only gave me two close, clean shaves, by the third&lt;br /&gt;  shave all started to drag and became too dull.&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:  For me the Astra* worked as well and cost the least; your results may vary&lt;br /&gt;*Astra is manufactured in Russia by Gillette.</li>
    <li> Razor blades are very subjective, what works great for me may not work so well for you.  I purchased a variety pack with a dozen or so varieties of blades in it, and the Astras preformed the best for me.  The Astra stainless worked equally well, but this platinum pack was a bit cheaper per blade at the time.  These aren&#x27;t as aggressive as Shark or Feather blades(both of which shred my face), but they still shave very close.</li>
    <li> they are incredibly sharp and provide a great shave when the proper shave technique is used. was a first time wet shave user and purchased this pack and I am not disappointed. will purchase again and again</li>
    <li> found blades to be excellent</li>
    <li> These are okay, better than the Derbys that I had previously been using.  They&#x27;re still not sharp enough for me; I can only use a blade two or three times per side before having to switch.</li>
    <li> Great blades at a great price.</li>
    <li> I got into straight shaving about a month ago. I ordered the Parker SR1 shavette which came with 5 shark blades. While I was satisfied with how the shark blades performed, I felt that it could be better. I decided to try out the Astra Plantinum blades and they are absolutely amazing! The shave is much smoother and easier than with the Shark blades. The only downside is it&#x27;s much easier to cut yourself.</li>
    <li> Astra&#x27;s are the only razors I buy. They&#x27;re the best. My only gripe is they are somewhat inconsistent. Sometimes I&#x27;ll run across a really sharp one and a really dull one.</li>
    <li> Close shave, good choice for all faces!(or Legs)</li>
    <li> I have 4 different razors, the only one I could get a decent shave from was Merkur adj. and had to use setting #4 when I normally use # 2.My other 3 name brand razors left stubble. I do not plan to buy these blades in the future.</li>
    <li> great product, came fast, i recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these blades for a week &amp; find them to be very Sharp.  I am a Dry Shaver, meaning I use no Foam or Jell therefore I am quite surprised that the Blades are so good.  I have used Disposable razors &amp; they did not do a good Job.  So far, I am quite Pleased with this Product</li>
    <li> Ok, so four stars seems excessive:  this blade isn&#x27;t as sharp as a feather or Mercur but it lasts over 15 shaves on my thick beard!  And unlike the derbys, it really is smoother.  The stars are for the price and longevity.  Remember every face is different!</li>
    <li> Excellent quality. Great price point. I have a coarse beard and sensitive skin and these work well for me.</li>
    <li> I get a closer shave with less irritation with these blades than with the Merkurs I switched from.  The paper wrapper is held on with a few dots of adhesive gum, but it doesn&#x27;t affect shaving performance.  On the first few blades I carefully removed the gum with hot water, but have since realized that it is unnecessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if these are the best, but they work well for me, and the price is just right.</li>
