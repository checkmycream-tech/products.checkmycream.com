<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> One of the best I&#x27;ve bought.  Not hard for me to open at all.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t travel without one of these. This is a little heavier than most, but is made of mirrored glass, rather than plastic. This makes it much more clear when looking for facial flaws.</li>
    <li> As some reviewers say--almost impossible to open without breaking fingernail.  Once open the non-magnifying mirror is okay, but small.  The magnifying mirror has a very short focal length--about 4&amp;#34; which means you can only see a small part of your face at one time--like a nose or one eye.  If my eye is in focus then my nose almost touches the glass and my chin rests on the bottom mirror.  It has a rounded bottom so the mirror rolls around as my chin touches it.  Functionally--it is impossible to use.  Don&#x27;t waste your money--buy something else.</li>
    <li> Perfect for the purse.  Great value.</li>
    <li> I got the mirror for plumbing work and it does the job. Very happy with it. would recommend it to all.</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror for travel and every day use. Works fantastic for plucking those random stray hairs you sometimes miss just glancing in a regular mirror.</li>
    <li> The 10x and high quality glass make this a fine product. I bought for my wife and she is very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Good mirror, I thought it was black, turns out it&#x27;s dark blue. but still sturdy.</li>
    <li> Hi there. One thing not visible in the photo for the compact, is the rhinestone bling on outside of it. It&#x27;s just a small circle of rhinestones, but was a nice surprise. The compact is so big, which is perfect, and the magnification...while helpful...can be a bit scary too!! I don&#x27;t know if we are MEANT to see our skin that close up. :) In all seriousness though, it&#x27;s perfect and I&#x27;m thrilled with the purchase.</li>
    <li> It is difficult to put on makeup while wearing reading glasses.  I have magnified mirrors, but this magnification is awesome! Compact fits neatly into my makeup bag &amp; purse.  I feel more confident knowing makeup is applied accurately. Great help in removing tiny, hard to see piece of glass from my husband&#x27;s foot. Would rate this product a 5 star if was easier to open.</li>
    <li> Looks cheesy and cheap - I&#x27;m embarrassed to be seen using it.. so I don&#x27;t.  It has been sitting in a drawer gathering dust since I got it.  It&#x27;s also very heavy for it&#x27;s size, so not a good choice for traveling even if it looked nice.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice compact piece. I got it as a gift for a daughter that travels for work. It is classy and the magnification is true.</li>
    <li> 5 stars for the 10x magnification, 1 star for design + materials. Maybe it was just the mirror I received, but I have a really tough time opening this compact. The clasp is very snug and its pretty hard to snap it open. Also, I see this as a point of failure in the future. At some point, I will damage the plastic in an effort to open it. Why can&#x27;t this be made of aluminum/other metal -- wouldn&#x27;t that be as light weight and more durable? I am so tired of these poorly thought out products.</li>
    <li> I really love this little compact mirror. it fits perfectly in my purse but yet it is large enough to get both my eyes in it in the magifying part. i love it...</li>
    <li> I feel like a rockabilly diva when I hold this XL floxite elegant compact magnification mirror in my hands.  Now if I could just find a retro car and master those victory rolls...</li>
    <li> A little big for a purse but serves the function, works great. I now wish I bought one with a light but this one oil great</li>
    <li> Great for applying eye makeup.</li>
    <li> Needed a 10x magnification for traveling. Love this mirror combo!</li>
    <li> Very handy.  A little bigger than I was expecting but it&#x27;s better to be too big than too small.</li>
    <li> This is the same as those other mirrors for $24.99 but in blue, and without the light.  This mirror is not as small as other compact mirrors that I have, but I bought it for the magnification, not the size. I am getting my luggage supplies together for trips and wanted a compact that had the same magnification as my tabletop mirror and this is it! I have been a long time tweezer girl, I started plucking long before waxing and threading and it is more economical and less painful (if you are used to it), and this little mirror allows me to see all the fine hairs that you miss on a 1x and 5x mirrors. It does take some adjustment to the right position for your eyesight, but if you are like me and like to see those pores up close and personal, this will suit you just fine and will fit into most clutches as well as being a nice purse mirror.  One thing is for sure, it won&#x27;t get lost in the clutter of your bag! lol</li>
    <li> A couple of fingerprints here and there and some white stuff that left a mark but was easily removed with soap and water. The package arrived without most of the retail packaging. For the price it&#x27;s okay. Not top notch but that&#x27;s not why you buy this mirror. Removing the top mirror off when it&#x27;s closed in compact mode is a bit tricky at first but you get used to it.  How it was shipped is satisfactory as well since there were sealed plastic bags of air to cushion any damaging falls.</li>
    <li> Excellent for travel! I can shave my head with no problems with this mirrior</li>
    <li> Love these!  Ordered three, two for me and one as a gift.</li>
    <li> This mirror does the job and is a great value. My aging eyes needed more than the 5X mirror I had been using, and this 10X mirror is just what I need to put on my eye makeup. It is easy to open, and the quality of the mirror&#x27;s reflection is excellent. I can see my entire face in the regular magnification side, and can see all of one eye and some of the other eye, at the same time, in the magnified side. I can only work on one eye at a time, so that&#x27;s fine for me. I bought a second blue colored one for my 84 year old mother, and she likes it too!</li>
    <li> I bought this for when I travel, but I have found out that I use this everyday. The top part is the regular mirror and the bottom part is magnified, which is great for fixing stray eyebrow hairs. The plastic is strong, unlike some other same priced compact mirror (or even those more expensive!)that snaps and breaks the part that closes it shut. Very useful, and I do like the quality of it, for the price that I paid. Which isn&#x27;t much at all.</li>
    <li> I hate to admit how bad my eyes have gotten, but, ya, I like to see every detail, especially with my eyes and lips. I&#x27;m spoiled with my Brookstone makeup mirror that like tells you the future of your face (it&#x27;s HUGE), so this compact version is great. I like the shape and size very much - it&#x27;s big, but, hey, I can see how I look. Just what I wanted!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a compact mirror.  There&#x27;s not much to say about it.  It has one magnifying side and one regular side.  It&#x27;s perfectly fine.</li>
    <li> really nice quality mirror</li>
    <li> Great little mirror. 10x magnified.  I just wish the magnified side was reversed from the regular side. I use the magnified side a lot and it would be more comfortable to hold if it was reversed.</li>
    <li> I bought this for traveling.  It&#x27;s a great little mirror and is the perfect size.</li>
    <li> convenient for travelling but small for daily use&lt;br /&gt; met my expectations,  can only use for travelling.&lt;br /&gt;larger diameter is mor useful.</li>
    <li> Great mirror for travel.</li>
    <li> Great products.  The body lotion is soothing &amp; my hands feel so soft; the aroma is yummy.</li>
    <li> I wanted this for travel, and discovered that it is too heavy to take with me.  In addition, it&#x27;s somewhat difficult to open.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and everyone should have one......I keep this one in my purse and always have it with me.</li>
    <li> I DO like this mirror but am not happy that it is so large.  It will fit nicely into my everyday purses, but for an evening bag, it would take up too much space.  The case is thin enough, it&#x27;s just the circumference that&#x27;s a little large.  Hold out your hand and stretch your thumb &amp; little finger out &amp; that&#x27;s about the width of the compact.</li>
    <li> As one who cannot focus on facial features without specs or contacts, I purchased this mirror for its higher magnification.  It came in a very attractive case, which is certainly a bonus.  My only complaint is that the relatively small size of the mirror allows one to view only one eye at a time.  A larger version would have been better, but the price would have been prohibitive.  All in all, I feel that this is a satisfactory product.</li>
    <li> The 10x power is great for putting on eye make-up without my glasses.  It is also nice and compact for travel, and at the same time, big enough to really do what I want it to do.  I can check the back of my hair with the regular mirror, and it can be propped open to sit on a table, so you can use both hands.  I love it!&lt;br /&gt;Vickie</li>
    <li> I ordered a second one. Just the right size.</li>
    <li> Great mirror with a good price tag.  Not too big and not too small. Perfect for my purse and love the two optical views.</li>
    <li> Just like it says, and what I wanted for travel.</li>
    <li> Searched for mirror with light!  This was in among them.  Very attractive but no light. Gave to a friend, very nice looking.</li>
    <li> It was OK for its function, but I had wanted it to fit in my purse and it was too large.  It sits in my office in case I want to check my eyes closer.</li>
    <li> Like the size, quality is good</li>
    <li> This mirror is crystal clear and large! The clasp on mine is rather tight, but that is better than it being loose.  I&#x27;m sure it will &amp;#34;give&amp;#34; a little with use. I had purchased a couple magnifying mirrors at Walmart and had to take each back because of distortion. And they were smaller and $6 each!</li>
    <li> I like the size of this mirror, it fits nicely in my hand. I have some difficulty using with the magnifying side of the mirror. It takes some getting used to (I deducted one star for that.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, it&#x27;s a very pretty, sturdy mirror.</li>
    <li> I really do love this mirror, and like the fact that it has one side with a closeup view. Due to it&#x27;s dark color the little raised triangle that sits on one side so you can see where to open the compact is very hard to see. I used a dab of silver glitter nail polish on the triangle so I can see it more clearly.</li>
    <li> i have this to do my eyebrows. eyes aren&#x27;t as good as they used to be. this is the only way i can do my eyebrows myself.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect!  The magnification is awesome and it fits perfect in my purse.  You can see everything that doesn&#x27;t belong.</li>
    <li> This really helps on the daily &#x27;search and destroy&#x27; missions on the whiskers. And what I love about it, beyond the magnification (which is, btw, scary-good) is my really small Tweezerma tweezers fit inside the mirror. Yeah, it&#x27;s a teentsy bit bothersome to open but that means the tweezers won&#x27;t fall out and get lost. Love it.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly, love the color as well!</li>
    <li> Attractive and useful, if a tad expensive</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so impressed with this mirror. It&#x27;s half the price of another very popular mirror of the same size that has Swarovski crystals on the front yet it manages to be superior in several ways: 1. It&#x27;s lighter in weight.  2. It closes securely (do NOT use your thumb nail to upon this mirror! It&#x27;s tightly closed so put your thumb all the way under the lip, apply pressure and use the middle of your thumb to lift it open. No broken nails:)). 3. It doesn&#x27;t just flap open or closed. You can control just how open or closed you want it to be - LOVE THAT! 4. The crystals on the top don&#x27;t stick out adding thickness to the mirror. And of course I already mentioned the great price.  I HIGHLY recommend it!</li>
    <li> Very nice for the price.</li>
    <li> I have never seen a magnifying mirror with more distortion. I followed the directions EXACTLY and wow. And in all reality, should one really need instructions for a mirror? In order to get a clear view I literally had to hold the mirror less than half an inch from my face. I could do that with ANY mirror. Oh, and at some point when you are trying to find the clarity? Everything in the mirror is upside down. Really, just save your money. I find it funny that from the time I bought and returned them to now the price has dropped five bucks. What&#x27;s does that tell you? My opinion? They&#x27;re not worth fifty cents.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t know this was so big, too big for me, will order a smaller version. Good product, love the magnification and was well needed</li>
    <li> this is a great mirror for you bag to carry with you on a trip.  not too big and not too small.</li>
    <li> The only reason I haven&#x27;t given this a 5-star is because I find this to be a very heavy travel mirror.  The lens is great at magnifying, but purchased to keep in my cosmetic bag and think I&#x27;ll keep looking for a lighter &amp; smaller one.</li>
    <li> This mirror is exactly what I was looking for and I couldn&#x27;t be happier......except if I could open it.  So far I have broken two fingernails and then gave up and have had my husband open it for me.  I am going on an extended trip and needed a mirror to take with me, not too small, but not too big.  This is perfect!  Just wish it would open easier.  Maybe that will come with more use.</li>
    <li> Complete waste of money.  It is impossible to open.  You practically need a wrench to open this thing.  I was so frustrated, I tossed it.  Save yourself the trouble, and get something easier to open!</li>
    <li> I thought I read that this mirror has lights? It doesn&#x27;t but the size is great and it&#x27;s perfect for travel. Just disappointed in the missing lights.</li>
    <li> I carry this in my makeup bag and use it when I travel. It&#x27;s lightweight without being cheap-feeling. I love being able to see more of my face than in most compact-size mirrors. The 10x magnification is enough for me to put on eyeliner, which needs to be precise, without glasses. Pretty little rhinestone detail on the lid was a nice surprise, too.</li>
    <li> Mirror part is fine. I just wish I&#x27;d known about the ugly bling on the outside.</li>
    <li> I like it because it is just the right size.</li>
    <li> Slim and fits easily in purse and has a GREAT magnifying mirror.  Well made and is holding up well.</li>
    <li> This mirror compact is better quality than expected.  The 10x magnifying side must be used up close, but is free of distortions.  I&#x27;m amazed at what can be seen with such strong magnification!  LOL!</li>
    <li> The quality of the mirror is great. It feels solid and not cheap. It magnifies enough for me to pluck my eyebrows without my glasses. It&#x27;s a good size. Not so small you can&#x27;t see but not too big it&#x27;s a pain to travel with. The blue plastic case looks and feels cheap. There is a little circle of rhinestones on the top that looks cheesy. I wish the outside was different but I didn&#x27;t buy it for what is looks like, I bought for how it works and it works great.</li>
    <li> Excellent product....fit every need of mine and came when scheduled.  :)</li>
    <li> Perfect for travel.  Small but not too small.  The image is a good quality.</li>
    <li> The mirror gives me the magnification that I need but it could be a little smaller. it takes up room in my purse.</li>
    <li> Hinge is a bit squirrely... don&#x27;t know how long it will last.</li>
    <li> This compact is high quality and sturdy, without being heavy.  The magnifying mirror reflects a crisp image without the double image I sometimes have seen on magnifying mirrors.  It is larger than a standard compact size but smaller than my traditional hand mirror; just the perfect size for plucking stray hairs or doing detailed makeup.  I could take or leave the rhinestones on the cover, but they don&#x27;t look too tacky.</li>
    <li> Nice size, and I like the protection of the compact format.  Bought one for the &amp;#34;bridal emergency&amp;#34; bag my daughter&#x27;s bridesmaids put together for her wedding day.  Magnification is good for applying eye make-up.  I hope I can reclaim it after the wedding!</li>
    <li> Very nice, but case came with scatch on it.</li>
    <li> Distortion free magnification. Fantastic for plucking chin and eyebrow hairs. Far better than any magnifying mirror I&#x27;ve had before, even better than the ones I&#x27;ve had with 15X and 20X magnification. I only wish it had suction cups to mount it, but as a hand held/travel mirror it&#x27;s excellent.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s beautiful and big. It&#x27;s perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rhinestones aren&#x27;t terrible looking... but they definitely look like rhinestones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised that the mirror was navy colored. I thought it would be black. But it looks great. I should have read better.</li>
    <li> Had cataracts removed and now cannot see up close.  This is awesome for eyebrown plucking and putting on eye makeup.  Folds up and locks well for travel.</li>
    <li> I am having issues with my eyes, but this works really well for me to check my makeup, do my eyebrows, etc. Nice little compact.</li>
    <li> Great magnification for on-the-go.  I&#x27;m in my forties and can&#x27;t see details without.  This one is good for traveling, but have the Floxite 15 on a stand for at-home use.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003NRYG1Q/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_70</li>
    <li> I love this. The magnifying side is great . Looks sturdy, small enough to fit in my purse. Unfortunately I lost the first one I bought so had to buy another one.</li>
    <li> Thought the large glass would make for easy tweezing.  It does not, as it distorts your image all around the outer perimeter of the glass, and only the central foci is usable.  Threw it out and purchased one with curved edges, as the curved edge is necessary for a non distorted view.</li>
    <li> Great mirror for travelling.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful for use either in the bathroom or sitting in an easy chair using the Ott light for bright light.  Terrific!</li>
    <li> I really like this mirror - use it every day because I can use the magnified side for mascara and the regular for my hair.  It&#x27;s small and fits easily into my makeup drawer</li>
    <li> This mirror is great for travel, you can keep it in your suitcase and not have to worry it will get broken.  I bought it as a gift and it went over very well.</li>
    <li> I really love the idea of this, but it&#x27;s still a bit too small for my liking. I never use the &#x27;normal&#x27; side of the mirror...but that 10x side is pretty neat. Found some things I&#x27;d rather not share at this point...let&#x27;s just say it&#x27;s become my new best friend when I can&#x27;t sleep!! I haul it out and go to town on those unwanted visitors about my face!!</li>
    <li> Very nice compact.  I do not find that it is hard to open like other reviews.  Love the blue and the size.  Wearing progressive lens glasses sometimes the small mirrors doesn&#x27;t focus for me.  Fits in the inside pocket of my purse nicely.</li>
    <li> Great mirror would buy again.</li>
    <li> The plastic case is strong but you cannot easily open it. It has a very tiny piece of plastic to lock the mirror but I am sure it will break after several uses. This will make the mirror unlocked all the time.</li>
    <li> I like this mirror so much that I ended up buying another one.  One for my purse and the other for my overnight bag.</li>
    <li> I love it but a little hard to open at first.</li>
    <li> Nice stocking stuffer!</li>
    <li> wife wanted this to replace broken one - just what she ordered and is happy to have a new one!</li>
    <li> It is a great size. Works exactly as it is supposed to. Easy to open and has a pretty cover on it. I love it. I can finally see myself in a mirror.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Good for travel use or at home. Will recommend to friends. A good purchase for the price paid.</li>
    <li> this mirror is great. i love it alot. its perfect for a mirror. i dont like small compact mirrors and this mirror is big but its not too big. i dont see any issue fitting it into a decent size purse. the 10x side is good and the regular side gets ur whole face in so u can see everything. I would definitely recommend it</li>
    <li> This is really good size to move, and nice mirror. one side is regular mirror and other side is 10 times zoom mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both side is very useful.</li>
    <li> I would have given this mirror 4 stars or 5 stars, but as I opened and took the plastic off the top the pieces fell off (decorative pieces which is like a diamond glitter paper). It&#x27;s a good mirror though.</li>
    <li> 10X mirror, great for traveling.  I use it to pluck my eyebrows.</li>
    <li> Magnified side completely distortioned.  Do not buy, do not waste your money!!  Regular side mirror is very bad quality.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for traveling!</li>
    <li> Nice quality mirror.  Nice size.  It&#x27;ll be my travel mirror.</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror for those of us that cannot see close up. This was a suggested by with another mirror I purchased and I really like it.</li>
    <li> Horrible distortion.  Have to close one eye, then tilt head to try for an angle where I can see anything, and still it&#x27;s distorted.  I&#x27;d send it back except shipping would cost more than the mirror is worth.  Save your money, I wish I had.</li>
    <li> This compact gives you the clarity and quality of a full size mirror in a compact size . This seller is 100% and would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I use this when I&#x27;m in the shower so I can see where I&#x27;m shaving. The rhinestones on the back will chip off on their own eventually.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT AND I PUT IT IN MY PURSE WHEN I GO. I WOULD RECCOMEND FRIEND TO BUY IT. THANKS. JEAN</li>
    <li> I own about 8 of these.  I have one at work, in my purse, by my bed, in the bathrooms, by my easy chair, etc.  They make wonderful gifts.  Everyone loves them.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t need glasses with this one and it&#x27;s very nice for travel.</li>
    <li> This works great and is convenient because it takes up less space. It&#x27;s a little on the heavy side to keep in your purse but def a make-up bag must-have!</li>
    <li> Great magnifying mirror.  The wife loves it. Good quality reflection with no distortion. Large viewing area.</li>
    <li> Well made. Looks good.</li>
    <li> I like the actual mirror but the case won&#x27;t stay open on it&#x27;s own.  I have to hold it with one hand to use.  Wish it could sit open on a table.</li>
    <li> I bought this for putting on my makeup when I travel.  The quality of the mirror is good, but there is no way to stand it up so you have both hands free!  I assumed the hinge would allow it to open clear back so it&#x27;d stand up on a counter.  Nope!  So unless you can apply your makeup with just one hand (while using the other to hold the mirror) this is pretty much useless.  Many thanks to Amazon for their prompt refund, though - gotta love Amazon!</li>
    <li> nice compact... i usually work the large magnified side.. it&#x27;s hard to hold when you want to tweeze as the&lt;br /&gt;both sides are bulky.. but over all it works when you are traveling or have to pop it out of your purse for something.</li>
    <li> great customer service, packaging by manufacturer needs to change to include bubble wrap or soft plastc to touch the case since now the paper which is backing is scratching up the back of mirror case and making it dull.</li>
    <li> The quality is great for the price, but my complaint is that to use the mirror on the magnifying side, there&#x27;s a design flaw. Holding it in my hand is fine, but when I set it down on a hard surface, it spins because the jeweled design makes it off balance. It moves, or puts it at to much of an angle. If the manufacturer reads this - please either inset the &amp;#34;jewels,&amp;#34; spread them out so it will sit flat, or remove them entirely. Otherwise, nice portable mirror!</li>
    <li> Big enough to be useful when traveling.</li>
    <li> This is such a great little mirror.  If you will need something in your bag or purse to see really close up or use to see you backside :) this is a great item for you.  I would buy it again and I know it will hold up for many more vacations.</li>
    <li> Gruber&#x27;d!!!  I put in a search for &amp;#34;lighted makeup mirror,&amp;#34; this popped up high on the list of hits, but it is NOT lighted.  I&#x27;m guessing that being &amp;#34;sponsered&amp;#34; biased Amazon&#x27;s reporting, and that is not what I consider ethical behavior.</li>
    <li> The optics are great -- no distortion. The hinge is stiff enough to stand in the position I leave it. The mirrors are larger than a typical compact. Great mirror, great price.</li>
    <li> Recent eye surgery prompted this purchase.  Other reviews said it was large, and it is!  But does the trick and the 10X magnification comes in handy now!  Would highly recommend for those needing magnification!!</li>
    <li> Nice 10x magnifying mirror to pack in my luggage.  Compact, and attractive enough for the price.  Does the job.</li>
    <li> nothing fancy, but just what i need.  easily finds a home in my purse.  yes, i would recommend it to both low and high-maintenance women.</li>
    <li> Just perfect for my requirements - I can see clearly and doesn&#x27;t get scratched in my handbag.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing like it in the stores that I&#x27;ve be able to find.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Great every day use, looks pretty on my counter and easy to hold while doing close up work.  I also pack it when traveling and I like it very much. No distortions and easy to open and close.  Well Made.</li>
    <li> Sturdy, solid design with powerful, clear magnification.</li>
    <li> I only wish it wasn&#x27;t so heavy but the mirror size is perfect</li>
    <li> Just what I needed.  I travel a lot and have trouble putting makeup on without a magnified mirror, so this goes with me and gets the job done!</li>
    <li> Beautiful compact. Just what I nee3ded and the magnification works very well.  M Ross</li>
    <li> A little big and somewhat heavy and you can tell it is not a cheap plastic mirror. Great for putting in your purse and tweezing eyebrows. Reflection is clear and not warped.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected from all the reviews. It&#x27;s a little distorted but better than other brands</li>
    <li> Works great as a mirror for my purse!</li>
    <li> No distortion with this mirror. Great for people who need glasses for close ups. I highly recommend this. Need to purchase another one as I gave the first one to my daughter who also thinks it is great to have on hand.</li>
    <li> Nice compact mirror with big magnification. I bought 1 for myself and 2 for gifts for my sisters.</li>
    <li> perfect! Nice size (large enough to see your whole face). Magnification side is perfect.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my favorite!  I am not sure how I did without it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for the right compact mirror with the high magnification.  It is just the right size!  I will order another!</li>
    <li> Great mirror! It just got back from a trip abroad - lightweight and easy to pack. The magnification is great and the regular side has no distortion.</li>
    <li> Best compact mirror I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
    <li> Slightly wider in diameter than i expected.... but works better due to its size. Fits perfectly in hand and comfortable to use. Mirror quality is good. 10 X mirror can almost make u see the dirt in the skin pores. A good buy !</li>
    <li> This is a nice sized mirror for traveling or to put in your desk or purse.  It is 4&amp;#34; diameter.  Good quality.  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> The two round optical mirrors are good, quality. There&#x27;s a small design on the outside cover that is round and looks like mimicked diamonds.  I wasn&#x27;t aware of the appearance more geared to a female and bought it for my son who keeps taking mine in the car. That is the only thing to be aware of.</li>
    <li> I have been using a magnifier at home, but when I travel I can&#x27;t see my lashes, this is a wonderful mirror for you purse!</li>
    <li> I can see perfectly now and the size makes it great for travel</li>
    <li> Used this mirror on our last trip and loved it. it&#x27;s compact but good magnification.</li>
    <li> Nice mirror. Great for traveling.</li>
    <li> This is the right size to fit into your make-up bag &amp; rest in the palm of your hand. Sturdy &amp; well-constructed. 10x magnification let&#x27;s you see the details for close work, like applying mascara or false lashes. If it came with a light, it would be perfect!</li>
    <li> I bought this to keep in my desk at work so I can apply lipstick before I head out of my office to go teach. The compact itself is nicely made, and the magnification side is really good for checking stray brows or hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too big for me to keep in my purse, but if you don&#x27;t mind larger mirrors, this would work well as a purse mirror since it is to sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would also be great for traveling to keep in your makeup bag.</li>
    <li> This product has a magnified side for your pores and other imperfections, anda regular side.  Nice large compact, but not too large to fit comfortably in your purse.  Very nice.</li>
    <li> The mirror is great except the cover could be a better design with good quality plastic.  It looks cheap and the size can be smaller to carry in small handbag.</li>
    <li> Great mirror for use when applying make up. The magnifying side is perfect for when I&#x27;m plucking my eyebrows or applying eye liner. I use it nearly everyday.</li>
    <li> What a great little gadget for you makeup bag. For people like me that need the magnification this is enough without being too much trouble.  It fits into the palm of your hand as shown on the product page, is lightweight and the clasp is secure and silent.  The mirrors are large enough to see your face and hair without being cumbersome.  The magnification at 10 x works for me.  It is enough for me to see the hairs of my eyebrows and to find something foreign in my eye.  All around a very satisfactory purchase.</li>
    <li> If this were just a bit smaller, it would be perfect but it&#x27;s so flat that it fits nicely even in a small purse.</li>
    <li> Awesome little compact. I was afraid it would be too large and heavy. Not so. The larger mirror is the magnifier. Perfect for tweezing or getting something out of you eye.</li>
    <li> It folds almost completly flat, the magnifying mirror does not distort, the case is strong enough that packing it for flying should be of little worry. The only improvement that I would like to see is one that is lighted.</li>
    <li> Very Nice.. Just what I was looking for..</li>
    <li> I love it.  I have trouble seeing up close and this works great for that.  I recommend it to anyone far sighted.</li>
    <li> Great size to hold and two magnifications work perfectly for someone who usually wears glasses and needs to see when applying makeup</li>
    <li> This compact is perfect!  Yes its on the large size, however you can SEE what you need to very quickly.  I love it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful mirror but not really very compact. Better used at home than in your purse. It is quality made though. I just need a smaller one to carry.</li>
    <li> A little too big for purse. but works well.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it, not too heavy and it travels very well.</li>
    <li> Well-made, good size, excellent magnification for what it is (an inexpensive mirror). Fits nicely in my rather small hands and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> I struggle with waking up in the morning. My solution for my hard days to put my makeup on at work. This mirror is perfect for my makeup bag. It is too big for my purse but fits right in my work makeup bag.</li>
    <li> Great for we older people with eyesight problems.&lt;br /&gt;Can see upper lip and chin with not a problem.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror--it&#x27;s perfect for travel because it weighs nothing, yet is protected by a cover. I can put on my eye make-up with the magnified side or use for a quick check-up glance, on the other.</li>
    <li> Good mirror.  Magnified on one side.  The other side is normal. Nice for your medium to large sized purse. My only complaint is it is so hard to open.</li>
    <li> A small mirror I can take on travel or carry with me and see without my reading glasses on.  Really clear.</li>
    <li> The compact mirror is a little bigger than your blusher, fits in a purse and has magnifying power needed to see around your eyes which is the toughest spot when you have reading glasses.  Good price and does what it needs to in my house.</li>
    <li> A bit large, but face it, if we need magnification, we also need a larger viewing area. Be prepared to see lots of wrinkles that you didn&#x27;t know you had. LOL</li>
    <li> Wow this item certainly is not as described.  It is so cheap.  The &amp;#34;crystals&amp;#34; on the front are horrible.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  In addition, the magnifier is very difficult to really see well.</li>
    <li> I bought several of these for both work and home. They are great and exactly as advertised. Definitely worth the price!</li>
    <li> I bought one of these a couple of years and ago, and absolutely loved it.  I carry it in my purse, and have had many nice comments about how classy the compact is.  I bought this one for my 83 year old aunt who LOVES it.  (One side of the compact has a 10X mirror.)  Great product and I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This mirror has a good magnifying side and it is actually big enough to be of some good.</li>
    <li> I purchased a few of these for my wife, daughter and daughter-in-law as stocking stuffers for Christmas.  I thought they would be tossed aside.  During a recent family dinner, I noticed all of them pulling them out of their purses.  My guess is that they liked them.  Who really knows?</li>
    <li> I bought this after the glass broke on my last magnifying mirror. I like the compact, because that provides more protection for the glass (I travel with cosmetics and they may get knocked around). It is great in finding flaws that are not readily seen when looking frontal in the mirror. (blemishes, stray hairs, puffiness, etc) I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product is handy and easy to carry. The mirror is  crystal clear. Although it is distortion free mirror, you have to adjust the position to make it well focused.</li>
    <li> Nice heft and high quality item at affordable price. I&#x27;ve enjoyed carrying this around in my purse with zero worries about breakage.</li>
    <li> I take it with me in my purse. perfect for checking face and hair. I like the magnifier mirror too</li>
    <li> Well made; excellent magnification. This has excellent quality mirrors in it, unlike some of the other options. I&#x27;m ordering another one for the office!</li>
    <li> This mirror is very nice, there is no distortion with the 10x. Nicely made and fits well in your hand as you use it, I do recommend this item.</li>
    <li> If you need a mirrow with extra close-up capabilities and do not want to borrow your wife&#x27;s everytime, this is the mirrow.  Its large mirrow surface allows me to see things much clearer.  I even found my wife borrowing it from time to time for her make-up.</li>
    <li> Since I need reading glasses which I don&#x27;t always have with me a the gym, this is a great compact option to put in my gym bag to use for applying makeup when getting ready for work. I like it1</li>
    <li> This little compact goes everywhere with me on travel.  It is small and the mirrors are protected when closed.  The magnifying mirror is really good as so many small, inexpensive magnifying mirrors are not.  I can see to tweeze without wearing my glasses.  I have a bigger magnifying mirror that doesn&#x27;t work this well and is more weight in my suitcase.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my travel bag and love it. It is a perfect thickness to fit easily in my cosmetic bag, yet the mirrors are a generous size and easy to use.</li>
    <li> So handy!  The eyes are fading and need some help. This is it.  I won&#x27;t leave home without it.</li>
    <li> Any magnifying mirror has a bit of distortion if not held at an exact distance.  This one is no different there, but once you find that sweet spot, there is no distortion.  Like that I have a regular mirror and a magnifying mirror.  Plan to take it when traveling.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  Rapid delivery, accurate description of quality product and saves my face from creating sores because I can&#x27;t see.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Sleek and pretty deep blue color!  Good buy.</li>
    <li> this is a very nice, bigger than the usual compact mirror, it&#x27;s 4&amp;#34; diameter, the magnifying mirror is very good.</li>
    <li> Wife uses this to look at her pretty face all the time. Fits right in your man purse.</li>
    <li> Had to re glue in the mirror on one side, otherwise the compact is nice, magnifies well.  Slim in design</li>
    <li> Had originally purchased the one with LEDs, but they were so useless that I returned it and ordered this one.  Ordered for eyebrows.  I&#x27;m keeping this one.  Will just need to be in good light to use.</li>
    <li> I dont know if I really want to see myself this close! But it works! If you really need to see the smallest imperfection, use this!</li>
    <li> I like the compact. It&#x27;s large and has a smaller circle of rhinestones on the lid. They aren&#x27;t raised so they probably wont be falling off anytime soon. However the silver paint that comes painted onto the rim of the lid comes of easily. This is only a vanity issue which is why I won&#x27;t be deducting stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a quality mirror and it sure as hell beats all the compact mirrors available at drugstores.</li>
    <li> Very nice item, good quality too.</li>
    <li> If you are like me and have trouble with your hands, the problem isn&#x27;t WITH the mirror....it&#x27;s getting the mirror OPEN.  Other than that it&#x27;s great.  Perfect for travel. Fits into my make up kit just fine.  Arrived here when expected and packed well.  As usual in my hunt for something that I needed my go to place...Amazon came through again.  I&#x27;ll use the mirror often even though I struggle to open it.  Hopefully one or the other of us will loosen up a bit!</li>
    <li> This is the perfect makeup mirror! I can see my whole face in it on one side, and great close up on the other side. Great size for thowing in your purse, and traveling.</li>
    <li> Can easily see eyebrows now, also use to apply mascara.</li>
    <li> This mirror is fabulously portable. It works better if you hold it upside down so that the 10X mirror is on top when applying your eye make up or detailing your eyebrows. It&#x27;s perfect for home use and for travel. Mine opens and closes very easily.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fine. It&#x27;s what I wanted. I think it is too small, but then if it was any bigger it would be annoying.</li>
    <li> It is a good mirror.  Some people complained that it was too big, but for me it just made it easier to find in my purse.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror.  It has great magnification and is so portable.  So glad I bought this over a stand up mirror.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I wanted a mirror to apply makeup and touch up my eyebrows every once in a while. This mirror is perfect. It is bigger and bulkier than typical compact mirrors but I wanted something that was a little bit easier to use/handle. So if you&#x27;re looking for a tiny mirror, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this one. But it will fit in your bag and be easy to find!</li>
    <li> great!  i ended up ordering a second one.</li>
    <li> I ordered this to take on trips to have the magnification along.  It is good quality, sturday and a nice looking mirror.  All in all I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It does work well, however, I would prefer the same size in a 5X.  It is just the right size for travel or home use.</li>
    <li> This mirror is gorgeous and I love it the magnification is perfect for doing my eyebrows and make up and its not cheaply made its very sturdy</li>
    <li> BETTER THAN EXPECTED.  I HAVE LOW POOR VISION SO THIS IS GREAT. I HAVE MACULAR DEGENERATION AND ONLY HAVE LIMITED VISION</li>
    <li> I have a 10X mirror stuck to my bathroom mirror with suction cups and love it.  This is much larger than I thought and the magnification does not seem to meet the standard I am use to.</li>
    <li> Larger than most but fits well in my palm, attractive case, and two views, regular and magnified 10x is good.</li>
    <li> This is just the right size and so nice with two different sizes of mirrors.  Shuts firmly, and is well made.  Best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> The mirror is just as described.  I wish it had a back that would hold it up so you could be hands free.  Magnification is good.</li>
    <li> This compact is big. I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be big, and wasn&#x27;t sure at first if I&#x27;d like that. But the large area is fantastic, especially for the magnification side. I really love this mirror. The 10x is better magnification that most people will need. It&#x27;s thin, sturdy, and closes neatly. Excellent value and very nice quality for the price. Would make a really nice item for a spa gift bag, travel kit, makeover party favor, etc.</li>
    <li> This is fine for plucking eyebrows. You have to hold it very close to your face, within just a few inches, for it to come into focus. A little heavy, so I wouldn&#x27;t keep it in my purse.</li>
    <li> Nice sized mirror with a generous amount of space to view overall look (1x side) and close look for delicate touches like eye makeup (10x side) good value too!</li>
    <li> Perfect size and magnification for travel.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good quality product. I wish the outside of the mirror was just plain, but it has these cheap looking rhinestones. Oh well, it does the job.</li>
    <li> I am giving this to my daughter for a Christmas present. She is always looking for a mirror for her purse and this is small enough to carry around and yet large enough to see your face in with the magnification perfect for plucking eyebrows. It is really great and can&#x27;t wait to give it to her.</li>
    <li> Was a bit hard to open at first but worked well to be able to see what one is doing</li>
    <li> While I have embraced most of being an aging female, I have relentlessly sought and triumphantly pulled every bristly hair on my chin that comes along! Over the past year I have contemplated, purchased and returned a few items to help me spot and pluck. First there was the mirror on a retractable arm. That one made it home, but before mounting it to the wall, I played with it a bit and decided that it wasn&#x27;t what I wanted because the lighting in our bathroom did not seem like it would be effective for optimal use. Back to the store. And I really did&#x27;t want to give be such a focal point. Then I scanned a few local stores for a make-up mirror with magnification and lighting. A few looked promising so I thought I would check out a few reviews on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily this little compact mirror popped up for me to consider. It is wonderful. Because it is lightweight, it doesn&#x27;t tire your arm to hold it and twist or turn to capture the best light. Because of its size, it easily slips away when not called to duty. I was instantly impressed (and a bit taken aback) with how much the 10x magnification showed and immediately found an emerging granny hair - gone in a blaze with my good slanted tweezers! I decided to use the morning light by the bathroom window and was rewarded even more with the extra help of sunlight. Minutes later I lost the hazy shadow that had been slowly creeping up above my upper lip!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said, I did read a number of reviews. The biggest complaint seemed to center around how ease of opening this. I found absolutely no problem with this. It took a slight bit of examination to see how to get it out of the hard plastic packaging the comes around the lip of the mirror, but no big deal. It came well protected in bubble wrap. The case is basic plastic, nothing fancy. I will say that the sparkly middle does make it easy to spot on the counter (if that side is up). The color is a dark blue.  Hope this helps you decide. I am well satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;9/2/2103&lt;br /&gt;I went to a big chain drugstore to find a similar mirror to just keep in my travel kit. While they had a number of options, none came close to this one. What I especially noticed was the concave shape of the other mirrors which I found very distracting. This mirror is of much better quality and a couple of bucks less. I am about to buy another - either the exact same on or another from this manufacturer.9/2/2103&lt;br /&gt;I went to a big chain drugstore to find a similar mirror to just keep in my travel kit.

    <li> I hate having to use small compact mirrors to put on makeup or see my hair from the back. This is larger than a compact mirror, but not too big or cumbersome. You can still hand hold it and it fits in my makeup bag. The magnification side was a bonus for me as that wasn&#x27;t my primary reason for the purchase. The magnified side shows all the details...maybe too many details... Great for tweezing though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However the case is not good quality at all. Although the mirror was packaged well, when I received it, the clear coat was already chipping off the blue plastic casing. There&#x27;s a circle of diamonds inlayed in the center of the top lid which I don&#x27;t care for either. They look nice right now, but I&#x27;m not sure that they stay that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a handy size and quality mirror. I just wish the case was quality as well.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for purse.</li>
    <li> You really see those pores clearly.</li>
    <li> Perfect......just what I needed.  It arrived quickly too.  Thanks so much Floxite......</li>
    <li> Good for travel. A little bit too powerful.</li>
    <li> Great concept! Lightweight, with great magnification, BUT the design is awful. Almost IMPOSSIBLE to open! the case is smooth &amp; &amp;#34;slippery&amp;#34; so not easy to grip while struggling to open. Target buyer certainly is a woman, yet the man who designed this didn&#x27;t make it easy for women with (even short) fingernails to open. I bought this for travel &amp; will take with me as I leave tomorrow so no time to return it. Will probably leave this behind in the hotel trash the day I leave.&lt;br /&gt;BIG disappointment.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic mirror that I use every day. The magnifying side is clear with zero distortion....perfect for applying eye makeup or tweeting. The regular side is great for checking the back of your hair and applying foundation or blush. Couldn&#x27;t do without this mirror and it is pretty enough to leave out on a bathroom counter or dresser.</li>
    <li> Awesome mirror!  Allows me to see the finest of blemishes.</li>
    <li> Nice compact.  The magnified side of the mirror seems a little too magnified for me.  I wanted it to help my aging eyes put my makeup on, but it is so magnified that I can&#x27;t see but one little spot on my face at a time.  On the good side, it&#x27;s really good for helping me see to pluck my eyebrows!</li>
    <li> This is perfect for traveling.  Also moving around at home.&lt;br /&gt;I can take it easily to any window for direct sunlight and&lt;br /&gt;be sure my chin and upper lip are not sporting any unwanted&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;whiskers&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Does what it says it&#x27;ll do.  Yep, i&#x27;s a mirror. Wish it could swivel more and fold flat. Pretty nice.</li>
    <li> I bought this compact mirror to carry in my travel make-up bag, which is just large enough for the basics- (a tube of BB cream, one eyeliner pencil, one mascara, one eye shadow compact, a tube of lip gloss, an eyelash curler, and two eye shadow brushes)&lt;br /&gt;It fits well, I like having the 10x magnification and the 1x, and I find the mirror large enough to see what needs to be seen. The plastic compact protects the mirror. Considering purchasing a second one of these to go in my bedside drawer. Would make a nice gift. My only complaint is that the exterior plastic compact lid scratches easily. Not a huge deal, and the only reason this item did not get five stars.</li>
    <li> great mirror.  looks like the picture and holds up great in my purse.  gets beat up everyday but holds up great.</li>
    <li> Exactly as stated. Exactly what we were looking for. Arrived immediately. Perfect for magnifying and fits easily in purse. Thank you. Very pleased with purchase.</li>
    <li> So compact and elegant! I love it and I bring it with me every day.</li>
    <li> We just used this mirror for the first time on a 5 week trip and it was perfect!  Loved that it folds to protect the mirrors and that it is so light weight.  It&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
    <li> This hand-held mirror has superior optics! The magnifying side allows you to see very up-close without any distortion - rare in a small magnifying mirror. However, unless you carry a good-sized bag, this would be too bulky and heavy.  Nevertheless, I love this mirror and can really see those eyebrow hairs!</li>
    <li> Except for the circular bling on the lid, I love this handheld mirror for doing my make-up and for tweezing my brows. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Between you and me, ladies, I never knew I had an almost 1-inch facial hair on the side of my face!  Even though I gave it 5 stars, I don&#x27;t especially like what it finds . . .</li>
    <li> Love the magnification, helps me see much better! :)</li>
    <li> I love this compact, it was the strength I was looking for and it fits perfectly in my purse. Worth the cost.</li>
    <li> The only mirror I have ever used that is not distorted. I have a couple of these especially for traveling!</li>
    <li> This mirror is just what i needed in a magnification travel mirror. It is just a little bit heavy but the visibility makes up for that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought it for eyebrow tweezing at home and it works great for that purpose. Not too small and not too big, so you can observe the whole face. But the design is poor - those false brilliants on the top look very cheap. Just blue plastic would be much better. But overall the mirror does its job well. Good for home use or as a make-up travel mirror.</li>
    <li> At first I was a bit skeptical about whether or not I would like this product. I absolutely love this product. It is a</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my mid 40&#x27;s and my eyes are having trouble seeing anything up close. I got this to keep in my purse for when I get something in my eye, etc. The magnification side is just right for tweezing or up close makeup, but it is also really nice to have the non-magnified side for checking your hair. I also like that the size is larger than a typical compact! It is easy to open and is very sturdy. It has been banging around in my overfull purse with all my other stuff, and it is still in good shape!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s as big as my hand so it&#x27;s not possible for me to open it with one hand. Other than that, I like it. It&#x27;s as sturdy and useful as a pocket mirror with great magnification!</li>
    <li> I originally bought one just to try it out.  After using it, I bought 2 more for myself.  Will be buying more for holiday stocking stuffers.</li>
    <li> good for travel, just to big and plastic no good finish, but the mirrors are ok :)</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS MIRROR.this is my favorite mirror thus far it&#x27;s so BIG IT&#x27;S HUGE I can see my whole face in this mirror not just half at a time....it has rhinestons on the front everytime I pull it out people compliment me and the want to know where did I get it?</li>
    <li> wanted a travel mirror and I think this will work great!</li>
    <li> good size, perfect for traveling!</li>
    <li> Extremely convenient! I can carry it around , so light and everyone should buy it! Yeah! Just buy it you won&#x27;t regret</li>
    <li> Nice, larger then most compacts.</li>
    <li> I really like this mirror. And it was shipped  lighning fast !!</li>
    <li> Give me what I want&lt;br /&gt;I mean I can see even the smallest problems in my skin</li>
    <li> Love the fact that you have a regular mirror and a magnifying one.  It fits in my purse and great for travel.  I love it .</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this mirror. I even purchased a second one to keep at work because I liked it so well. It&#x27;s a nice size, good quality, attractive case-everything I wanted.</li>
    <li> I love my compact. I use it for when I am out on the trail and I need my costume make up on. I need a good mirror at those times and this compact works well for that purpose&lt;br /&gt;It came carefully wrapped and in a timely fashion. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I needed this Compact for a trip, and it was wonderful.  The size is 4\\&quot; diameter, and it weighs 4oz.  The hinge has just enough resistance to stay open at a 45 degree angle allowing for hands-free use, if necessary.  The magnifying glass is awesome.  I am so very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Product shipped very quickly and the quality is as described.  It looks very black and not blue.  I am very happy with it.  The 10x magnification is excellent.</li>
    <li> My eyesight is going a bit so this helps when I do close up stuff to my face. Tweezing, make up. etc.</li>
    <li> Love this, was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
