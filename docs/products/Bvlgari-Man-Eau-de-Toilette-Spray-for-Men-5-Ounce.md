      <li>Strictly for MAN, excellent fragrance, second time I buy it!!</li>
      <li>Buy this so called \\&quot;authentic</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Bvlgari MAN cologne for men smells great and is contained in a large, easy to spray bottle.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light and refreshing and lasts all day.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s always nice to receive exactly what I ordered</li>
      <li>The bottle was huge giving the impression that it was cheap cologne.  </li>
      <li>My signature aroma at a cheap price.</li>
      <li>The reason I bought this spray was because the \\&quot;SAMPLE\\&quot; spray that I tried lasted for a day, I&#x27;m serious, and I could still get the scent from my clothes day after it was awesome.</li>
      <li>and that&#x27;s if you&#x27;re lucky.</li>
      <li>Great Product, size is much more economical to purchase than the smaller bottles of 50 ML or 100 ML, definitely will purchase again from this vendor.</li>
      <li>thay fades real fast.</li>
      <li>So i conclude the price might have been right</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re better off looking for the sample of this, it will last longer and hold true to its value.</li>
      <li>Great smell, but doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
      <li>Was exactly what I was looking for, arrived on time.</li>
      <li>I first purchased this when I was vacationing in Phoenix.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too strong and it last for hours.</li>
      <li>Super sized for just a little more.  </li>
      <li>aroma lasts for max 15 minutes , expected more from Bvlgari</li>
      <li>The product is genuine and the bottles were a lot bigger than I thought.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just a lot more than I expected.  </li>
      <li>Very competitive price.</li>
      <li>I also love the other scents blv and aqua.  </li>
      <li>THis is a great price for this cologne since I usually buy it at Macy&#x27;s in smaller sizes.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately the 5 oz bottle that i purchased for $44  was too good to be true.</li>
      <li>Long lasting with many compliments.</li>
      <li>I only bought this because ive had in the past an loved the smell.</li>
      <li>The big size is fine for using at home, but would be too big for packing on a trip.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;5 oz for the price it was offered, is simply amazing.&lt;br /&gt;Strong &amp; smart bottle.</li>
      <li>It smells almost like the real thing initially but has a wierd smells</li>
      <li>this cologne is a big rip off and i sincerely advice you not to waste your money.</li>
      <li>but this particular spray/scent will last maybe 1.5 hours</li>

    <li> Want to smell like the best man buy this</li>
    <li> I first purchased this when I was vacationing in Phoenix.  Got home and received a ton of compliments on how I smell. It&#x27;s light and refreshing and lasts all day. I do spay a small amount on the front of my shirt. Great product!</li>

    <li> BEST cologne in the WORLD!!!</li>
    <li> Great Product, size is much more economical to purchase than the smaller bottles of 50 ML or 100 ML, definitely will purchase again from this vendor.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately the 5 oz bottle that i purchased for $44  was too good to be true. I believe it to be a knock off.  It smells almost like the real thing initially but has a wierd smells thay fades real fast. I only bought this because ive had in the past an loved the smell. So i conclude the price might have been right but i dnt even use a this point after 4-5 uses i wish i could return for refund and go buy the 2.5 ounce at macys for like $80 def will be more cautious by purchasing online fraganced</li>
    <li> A gift for my son. He loves this one.</li>
    <li> Super sized for just a little more.  Great price for this bottle.  Very satisfied</li>
    <li> Amazing! I totally recomend!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not overpowering, like some colognes I&#x27;ve had in the past.  The big size is fine for using at home, but would be too big for packing on a trip.  Great scent.</li>
    <li> Apart from the packaging and nice design this cologne is a big rip off and i sincerely advice you not to waste your money. Yes the spray smells nice that&#x27;s why I bought it but this particular spray/scent will last maybe 1.5 hours and that&#x27;s if you&#x27;re lucky. DISASTER! The reason I bought this spray was because the \\&quot;SAMPLE\\&quot; spray that I tried lasted for a day, I&#x27;m serious, and I could still get the scent from my clothes day after it was awesome. Take it from me you&#x27;re better off looking for the sample of this, it will last longer and hold true to its value. Buy this so called \\&quot;authentic one\\&quot; and I guarantee you&#x27;ll regret doing it.&lt;br /&gt;This joins my list of colognes I trusted and they ended up being faker than anything you&#x27;d find in a scanty flee market. Shame shame shame&lt;br /&gt;Oh and absolutely no surprise to me the price was drastically reduced. hmmmmm</li>
    <li> Great.  Exactly as expected</li>
    <li> After you spray it, it will last for few minutes only. Won&#x27;t stay longer like others. Poor quality product, I wish I didn&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> Great smell, but doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> aroma lasts for max 15 minutes , expected more from Bvlgari</li>
    <li> Great any time fragrance.  Long lasting with many compliments.</li>
    <li> Wonderful cologne.  I also love the other scents blv and aqua.  My wife loves them as well, and I often am asked by others what I am wearing.  Especially, with bvlgari man.</li>
    <li> I love it is a great for Mem</li>
