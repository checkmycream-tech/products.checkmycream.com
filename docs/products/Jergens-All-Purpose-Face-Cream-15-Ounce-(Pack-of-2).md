      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>works better than all of them!&amp;#34;  </li>
      <li>Jergen is our family favorite face cream.</li>
      <li>Its nothing more than mineral oil, beeswax and fragrance.</li>
      <li>I sleep better when I apply to my feet, legs, arms, face, neck -</li>
      <li>Good Product, Fast Delivery.</li>
      <li>this product seems to easily accumulate any longer</li>
      <li>great on dry elbows and skin and lovely lovely smell.</li>
      <li>(she&#x27;s in her 90&#x27;s) and finds it to be just as effective as the higher priced creams she&#x27;s tried.</li>
      <li>This cream is incredibly oily, I would not recommend that you put this product on your face unless you have incredibly dry skin.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s really that amazing and works better than all the super fancy and pricey formulations.</li>
      <li>My makeup applied so smoothly.  </li>
      <li>This brand is my replacement for another brand which no longer available.</li>
      <li>When I wake up in the morning, my skin is glowing and smooth.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t let the cheap price fool you into believing it&#x27;s a cheap product.  </li>
      <li>My face is finally smooth ...</li>
      <li>My Mom finds the scent and consistency very appealing, but this would not be a good choice if you&#x27;re looking for a no or low-scent moisturizer, or want something less intensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>First I must say, these containers are huge!</li>
      <li>, I didn&#x27;t trust a cream could clean out impurities.  </li>
      <li>I had great success using it for dry skin on my knees and elbows during the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Items arrived quickly and as described.</li>
      <li>Luckily, my sister-in-law remembered the smell from something her Mom used to use a long time ago and may still use today, so off they go to her and good riddance....</li>
      <li>and i can see her face more soft and plump!</li>
      <li>Even if I can&#x27;t use it for a long period during the day, a quick application followed by wiping it off with a tissue is still effective at improving my skin.</li>
      <li>end how to remedy this issue because there don&#x27;t appear to be many similar products on the market that soften your skin while they clean without being overly greasy or drying.</li>
      <li>The cream is however good for other parts of your body.  </li>
      <li>like it better than St Ivy cream which costs more and does not really work for us for whole of day.</li>
      <li>she said it very suitable for overnight, and  soft the skin, especially, the hand and  feet.</li>
      <li>face looks noticeably better when using this cream regularly.</li>
      <li>Overall satisfied with this product.</li>
      <li>but I still use this as my first step...</li>
      <li>I actually like this one better than Pond&#x27;s, Queen Helene, and Abolene as well.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure how it really cleanses but is a great moisturizer.</li>
      <li>She has  been using this product every day for years, and says that it leaves her skin soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>Jergen&#x27;s All Purpose Face Cream is as close as you will come to that original formula from so long ago and contains both the beeswax and sodium borate that the original Pond&#x27;s had.</li>
      <li>Also great makeup removes and works good as a creamy base for makeup.</li>
      <li>let it absorb (its very wet/greasy at first.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately the manufacturer has greatly changed the original formula.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really think how else to describe it -</li>
      <li>but I plan on looking young for as many years as possible and</li>
      <li>The most recent people who thought I was &#x27;early 50&#x27;s&#x27; were my nail stylists.  </li>
      <li>I tried a slew of department store creams that promised me everything and left me with skin that became even more reactive and sensitive.  </li>
      <li>Good lord, this smells like an old lady perfume that someone left out sitting in the sun for so long that that the scent turned on itself.&lt;br</li>
      <li>shipping was fast and packed good and the face cream goes on smooth and the jars are big, and a little goes a long was</li>
      <li>The Sahara Desert that was once my face, looked and felt so vibrant and</li>
      <li>The main ingredient is mineral oil, so that is probably why.</li>
      <li>It looked very feminine and old school.</li>
      <li>This stuff made me break out, and I don&#x27;t normally have skin issues.</li>
      <li>As soon as I begin to rub it into my eyelashes, this new batch starts to make my eyes burn.  </li>
      <li>Not only is it AMAZING to remove face paint, halloween makeup and everyday makeup..</li>
      <li>I have super dry and acne prone skin</li>
      <li>I then apply Lancome&#x27;s Tonique Conforte, Estee Lauder&#x27;s Advanced Night Repair (night only), and then finally a coat of Vitamin E Cream by Fruit of the Earth.  </li>
      <li>size being smaller is perfect for travel as well as the pink lid quickly identifies what it is among all the other mysterious little grooming containers.)</li>
      <li>did try many different cold creams and this one appears like the one I will stick with for sure!  </li>
      <li>been using this cream since I was a kid, makes your skin very soft.</li>
      <li>but it will leave your skin as SOFT AS A BABYS BUTT!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d use it as a facial moisturizer, as it&#x27;s pretty greasy stuff.</li>
      <li>I slather it on, then wipe it off with a wet washcloth and it leaves my skin amazingly soft and clean.</li>
      <li>wow.</li>
      <li>WOW..</li>
      <li>Wow.  </li>
      <li>YOU were early 50&#x27;s!&amp;#34; - I attribute these reactions which I hear routinely to my must-have</li>
      <li>my mom and grandma used this stuff and they had REALLY young looking skin</li>
      <li>This product is useful for both the face and other body ares needing moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>Talk about a major improvement!</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t be fooled by perfumes and creamy consistency and pretty pink color.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Highly recommend if you&#x27;re looking for a traditional \\&quot;cold cream\\&quot; at a great price.</li>
      <li>I use it not just for my face but for my whole body, since I have dry skin.</li>
      <li>It is a nice thick consistency but will leave your skin a bit wet looking</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a very traditional cream formulation (I won&#x27;t call it \\&quot;old fashioned\\&quot; since I&#x27;m getting on in years myself!)</li>
      <li>I take a dab on my finger and rub into my eyelashes like I&#x27;ve done for 15+ years to get the mascara up, then I wipe it away with a piece of toilet paper and wash my face normally.  </li>
      <li>During the day, I do not apply the EL ANR and use Olay Complete SPF 30 lotion as the final step.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Jergen is our family favorite face cream. We have tried a dozens of costly creams before and after this and have settled down for this one. This is a little sticky for few minutes however suites our skins well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a full day effect, so we do not really need a moisturizer and other stuff to be applied on our face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We like it better than St Ivy cream which costs more and does not really work for us for whole of day.</li>
    <li> This product is terrible for you !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look it up on the \\&quot;Environmental Working Group\\&quot;&#x27;s website  &#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A number of ingredients in this product are unsafe! Don&#x27;t be fooled by perfumes and creamy consistency and pretty pink color. Be discriminating and use your head !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look up all of your personal care products at that website. You&#x27;ll be astounded at how many of them are carcinogenic, toxic to your body, toxic to the environment, etc. Many products can make you sick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily EWG also lists safe products, and rates and analyzes the ingredients. Make it your cosmetics/personal health care Bible !</li>
    <li> Wow.  Sometimes the very best products are the simplest ones.  Don&#x27;t let the cheap price fool you into believing it&#x27;s a cheap product.  No way.  It outperforms the miracle creams that charge hundreds of dollars for around an ounce or so.  My face is finally smooth ... like glass.  This winter has left my skin so parched and dry - just completely raw.  The decade of my 30&#x27;s coupled with the harsh climate, my skin was just so red, scaly, and looking so flaky underneath any makeup I applied.  Simply awful.  I tried a slew of department store creams that promised me everything and left me with skin that became even more reactive and sensitive.  That was the final straw.  I was desperate.  I decided to turn to what the old Hollywood celebrities swore by - cold cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The concept of not using water and a cleanser to wash my face frightened me.  After 3 decades of using water as part of a cleansing regimen and now being taught to not... well, it was weird.  I&#x27;m not gonna lie, I didn&#x27;t trust a cream could clean out impurities.  As the days went by and I stuck to the routine, my skin just felt so wonderful and glow-y!  My makeup applied so smoothly.  The Sahara Desert that was once my face, looked and felt so vibrant and fresh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did try many different cold creams and this one appears like the one I will stick with for sure!  I actually like this one better than Pond&#x27;s, Queen Helene, and Abolene as well.  This is my routine:  I apply a generous amount on my face and wipe it off with a tissue.  I apply another coat and then use a very warm wash cloth and wipe it off.  I then apply Lancome&#x27;s Tonique Conforte, Estee Lauder&#x27;s Advanced Night Repair (night only), and then finally a coat of Vitamin E Cream by Fruit of the Earth.  During the day, I do not apply the EL ANR and use Olay Complete SPF 30 lotion as the final step.  As you can see, my face care routine is a mix of drugstore and department store brands (all by trial and error!)  Everyone&#x27;s skin is sodifferent, but this is what has worked best for me.  I have access to expensive department store brands (I work in the cosmetics industry) but I still use this as my first step... it&#x27;s really that amazing and works better than all the super fancy and pricey formulations.</li>
    <li> This cream is incredibly oily, I would not recommend that you put this product on your face unless you have incredibly dry skin.  This cream may cause breakouts for people who already have regular to oily skin types.  The cream is however good for other parts of your body.  I found that it helped soften my feet when I applied it at night.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m almost 68.  The most recent people who thought I was &#x27;early 50&#x27;s&#x27; were my nail stylists.  On my last visit they were chattering away in their native tongue to each other as usual. I had brought my single, 49-year-old son with me a few visits back, who was a big hit with the girls.  One addressed me in English to ask &#x27;how old my son is?&#x27; - When I told her, they all burst out saying, &amp;#34;We thought YOU were early 50&#x27;s!&amp;#34; - I attribute these reactions which I hear routinely to my must-have Jergens All Purpose Face Cream.  I order it in bulk.  I sleep better when I apply to my feet, legs, arms, face, neck - It&#x27;s even a good hair conditioner from the traces that get into my hair overnight.  I had one friend at work who started buying it because of me, who said, &amp;#34;I wish I had met you sooner - to think of all the money I&#x27;ve spent on expensive face creams and my Jergens works better than all of them!&amp;#34;  I could go on &amp; on, but I couldn&#x27;t do without this stuff.  (btw: if used as a makeup base, I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s best to dilute with a little spray of water, then blot - AND - I almost forgot - My facial redness cleared up at least 90% overnight when I started using my Jergens!) (Also, as with any lotion or cream, if you keep the lid on between uses, it won&#x27;t dry out - and even if it does thicken, which can happen, a teaspoon of water mixed into jar instantly fixes that.) (Last: the small 6 oz. size being smaller is perfect for travel as well as the pink lid quickly identifies what it is among all the other mysterious little grooming containers.)</li>
    <li> Love this product. I use it not just for my face but for my whole body, since I have dry skin. Only thing that works for me. Also great makeup removes and works good as a creamy base for makeup.</li>
    <li> Items arrived quickly and as described.</li>
    <li> Good Product, Fast Delivery. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Quite greasy- I wouldn&#x27;t use it on my face. I use it to shave my legs and it works well for that. Not a high quality product- you can&#x27;t expect much when you&#x27;re only spending a few dollars.</li>
    <li> I bought this as an alternative to Pond&#x27;s (which now has parabens in them, to which my skin reacts badly).  Jergen&#x27;s is thicker than Pond&#x27;s and has a texture like creamy Vaseline.  It might work well for eye make-up, but it&#x27;s not worth the cost for just that.</li>
    <li> Bought this for mom, who uses it and loves it.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm. I use this as an overnight cream, day cream, etc. Doesn&#x27;t matter. I needed a moisturizer to protect and hydrate my face. Idk about anyone else but I plan on looking young for as many years as possible and I believe moisturization and hydration of the face and skin is key. So this product was just what the doctor ordered when I saw it at walmart. It looked very feminine and old school. I didn&#x27;t care. I never looked back. This stuff works. I apply it at night and dilute it with cold water and feels so good. When I wake up in the morning, my skin is glowing and smooth. I apply this with sunscreen as a day cream when I go out and it&#x27;s just as effective. If your having thoughts about getting it, do it already. It&#x27;s one of the cheapest and most effective products I&#x27;ve ever had.  UPDATE 2/2015: I couldn&#x27;t tolerate the smell, oiliness, color, texture, and attraction of dirt and dust this product seems to easily accumulate any longer so I switched to Pond&#x27;s Dry Skin Cream and wow. Talk about a major improvement! It&#x27;s a way better and more effective product that has neutral color, smell, leaves skin non-greasy, and moisturized. I would recommend Jergen&#x27;s Face Cream if you are on an extremely low budget.</li>
    <li> moisturizes well, removes grime with no difficulty</li>
    <li> Love this face cream, my grandma used to use it.</li>
    <li> Its made by jergens. its great&lt;br /&gt;takes a lot of rubbing to get it in, but that is good for your face.&lt;br /&gt;Smells great</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how the recipe changed from the one I bought years ago and just finished using, but this burns my eyes a bit to use.  I take a dab on my finger and rub into my eyelashes like I&#x27;ve done for 15+ years to get the mascara up, then I wipe it away with a piece of toilet paper and wash my face normally.  As soon as I begin to rub it into my eyelashes, this new batch starts to make my eyes burn.  I am at wits end how to remedy this issue because there don&#x27;t appear to be many similar products on the market that soften your skin while they clean without being overly greasy or drying.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful to.use as a makeup remover the price is wonderful&lt;br /&gt;U can use it on your legs face arms to moisturerize</li>
    <li> been using this cream since I was a kid, makes your skin very soft.</li>
    <li> Overall satisfied with this product. I have super dry and acne prone skin so finding a face lotion that won&#x27;t break me out is really hard. First I must say, these containers are huge! Just one will last forever! It is a nice thick consistency but will leave your skin a bit wet looking so I best recommend putting it on before you go to bed. It has a bit of a weird scent but nothing horrible. I&#x27;m not sure how it really cleanses but is a great moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I gave this cream to my mom. It was too greasy. After one month of using this cream my mother&#x27;s face was destroyed. I am ashamed of this gift. Wasted Money</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for 40 yrs.</li>
    <li> I buy this for my Mom who uses it regularly not only as a face cream, but also as an all-over body moisturizer. She&#x27;s been using it for years (she&#x27;s in her 90&#x27;s) and finds it to be just as effective as the higher priced creams she&#x27;s tried. She&#x27;s especially fond of using it as a hand and leg cream in the winter months to prevent dry skin itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very traditional cream formulation (I won&#x27;t call it \\&quot;old fashioned\\&quot; since I&#x27;m getting on in years myself!) with a fairly heavy scent (albeit a generally pleasant one) and a heavy base with a high oil content. My Mom finds the scent and consistency very appealing, but this would not be a good choice if you&#x27;re looking for a no or low-scent moisturizer, or want something less intensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price per ounce is remarkable considering what the higher-end creams go for. The price on Amazon for a 2-pack was less than some stores charge for a single jar (if you can find it at all).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend if you&#x27;re looking for a traditional \\&quot;cold cream\\&quot; at a great price.</li>
    <li> I call this stuff &amp;#34;granny creme&amp;#34; lol..cuz everyone&#x27;s granny used this I swear since the dang 50&#x27;s. Its nothing more than mineral oil, beeswax and fragrance. But I will tell you what ladies....FORGET oil of olay or other spendy cremes (unless you have oily skin..then dismiss all Im about to say) THIS IS THE STUFF!! Not only is it AMAZING to remove face paint, halloween makeup and everyday makeup..but it will leave your skin as SOFT AS A BABYS BUTT! and smells amazing. Use this after your shower..let it absorb (its very wet/greasy at first. Then later...apply your makeup. Really works great for sealing in moisture. Its inexpensive and works GREAT..my mom and grandma used this stuff and they had REALLY young looking skin till they day they both passed. I keep tons of this around and I even use it for my entire body. Great on legs after shaving...great on dry elbows and skin and lovely lovely smell.</li>
    <li> I looooove this cream! It is soft (and pink!) and removes every last drop of makeup. I slather it on, then wipe it off with a wet washcloth and it leaves my skin amazingly soft and clean. It also works well as a heavy-duty moisturizer on dry legs, feet, and hands. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d use it as a facial moisturizer, as it&#x27;s pretty greasy stuff. It smells nice too - it&#x27;s a bit of an &amp;#34;old fashioned&amp;#34; smell - I can&#x27;t really think how else to describe it - but I do not find it offensive at all.</li>
    <li> I got this face cream for my mom. She has  been using this product every day for years, and says that it leaves her skin soft and smooth. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I do like the product. I didn&#x27;t like it that both jars leaked and I lost part of what I paid for.</li>
    <li> This is the best face cream I have ever used. It is good for all over not just the face.</li>
    <li> Great product, quick shipment. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> My mom loves this and i can see her face more soft and plump! This is really thick and a little bit greasy just use it at night.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again</li>
    <li> This stuff made me break out, and I don&#x27;t normally have skin issues. The main ingredient is mineral oil, so that is probably why. It is thick, pink, and smells odd. I will not be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> It does all the things it says on the label but one of the ingredients is mineral oil, so i wouldnt reccommend it to people with already oily skin. It starts off as a creamy substance and then transforms into this heavy greasy substance...my only dislike.</li>
    <li> This product is useful for both the face and other body ares needing moisturizing.  This brand is my replacement for another brand which no longer available.</li>
    <li> So, this just came today and I used it tonight. Seriously, this is the first item I bought from Amazon after reading all the great reviews that is sooooo off base! This does take off all your make-up, but in exchange for what? For wanting to throw up on yourself while it&#x27;s on your face? Good lord, this smells like an old lady perfume that someone left out sitting in the sun for so long that that the scent turned on itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so convinced by the reviews that I bought a 2-pack. (sigh) Luckily, my sister-in-law remembered the smell from something her Mom used to use a long time ago and may still use today, so off they go to her and good riddance....tsk...I can still smell a whiff of it now and then and I washed my face twice already. Geez.</li>
    <li> a nice cream but too thick and leaves a greasy residue on my skin and the smell is a bit harsh as well. Would not purchase again</li>
    <li> When I started looking into skin care I really wanted to use Pond&#x27;s Cold Cream. Unfortunately the manufacturer has greatly changed the original formula. Jergen&#x27;s All Purpose Face Cream is as close as you will come to that original formula from so long ago and contains both the beeswax and sodium borate that the original Pond&#x27;s had. Here is the ingredient list for this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Mineral Oil , Water , Beeswax (Apis Mellifera) , Magnesium Aluminium Silicate , Sodium Borate , Fragrance , Isopropyl Myristate , DMDM Hydantoin , Red 4&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This face cream is very effective and can be found cheaply at most drug stores. You can use it as a face cream, a body cream, a base for make-up (I like it for eye shadow), and also as a make-up remover. I had great success using it for dry skin on my knees and elbows during the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face looks noticeably better when using this cream regularly. My skin is fresher, softer, and less prone to acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use this at night. It&#x27;s quite oily and it soils my pillow and my hair. Instead, I put it on during the day when I&#x27;m alone and go about my chores. At first, my face will be liberally covered with the cream, but after a few hours 85% of it will absorb into the skin and then I just wipe the rest of it off. Even if I can&#x27;t use it for a long period during the day, a quick application followed by wiping it off with a tissue is still effective at improving my skin.</li>
    <li> she said it very suitable for overnight, and  soft the skin, especially, the hand and  feet.I will purchase it anain.</li>
    <li> shipping was fast and packed good and the face cream goes on smooth and the jars are big, and a little goes a long was</li>
    <li> Smells so bad. It&#x27;s way too fragrant.</li>
    <li> WOW.. THIS IS GREAT PRODUCT!  GREAT FOR USING AT NIGHT BEFORE BEDTIME..</li>
</ol>
