<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry to hear that so many people have had problems using this product. I used it today and while I can see how it can be a bit messy it&#x27;s pretty easy to keep it under control if you follow the directions. Keep the wax (sugar, whatever) warm, the consistency of honey, while you are using it, as instructed. You might have to heat it up again after a few minutes, it will cool down over time and become hard. Make sure that the wax isn&#x27;t dripping off the stick when you are applying it to your skin. Apply the wax in the direction of the hair growth, press down (in the direction of the hair growth) with the strip, hold your skin tight, and QUICKLY pull it back to remove from your skin. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it, a very thin layer of the wax will do the trick. If your skin is wet or damp or sweaty, or if there is any oil / lotion on it, it won&#x27;t work because the wax won&#x27;t adhere to your skin or the hair. (That&#x27;s why the instructions say to wash and completely dry the area thoroughly before use.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I waxed my legs with this product and am 100% satisfied with the results. I don&#x27;t have coarse leg hair but it was fairly long (definitely more than the recommended 1/4 inch!) and it worked fantastically. I was able to re-use the strips a few times, I ended up using about 4-5 strips per leg. The included azulene oil is nice and helps to remove excess wax when you are done. It wasn&#x27;t pain-free, but it was a lot less painful than the last time I had my legs waxed at a salon. I also didn&#x27;t get any bumps or redness like I did when I had my last waxing at the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used about half of the wax for my legs, so I&#x27;ll get another use out of it and will use it on some other smaller areas. This is a bargain at around five bucks for a leg wax!</li>
    <li> Okay for upper lip, but I have yet to master the eyebrows with this yet.  I think it&#x27;s important to warm it up to the proper temperature  for a satisfactory result.</li>
    <li> I just bought Parissa&#x27;s body sugar yesterday, and I love it so much!  I had never had a wax or used any kind of wax product before this, so I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect.  Mostly I was scared that it would hurt.  I had used a Braun epilator before and was very unsatisfied because it was painful, ineffective, and left my legs bumpy and irritated, not smooth.    I was amazed that this body sugar is virtually painless.  I have always had extremely sensitive skin, but I found this quite tolerable, even pleasant.  I liked the warm sensation of the sugar on my skin (it&#x27;s microwavable!) and it didn&#x27;t cause any redness or irritation.  And it works!    Another plus: It dissolves quickly with just a damp cloth.  I have heard people complain about waxes being messy, but I just keep a damp washcloth with me while using it so I can easily wipe up any drips or excess.    One very minor complaint: I could really use some more strips!  I have already used all the strips that came with the kit, and I still have a few patches I want to sugar!  But as I said, that&#x27;s just a minor issue.  The good news is that I can&#x27;t wait to get some more strips so I can keep using this stuff.  It&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve been this satisfied with a purchase for myself.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best home wax kit I have ever used. I have been using this wax for a year now. At first, I thought I was making a mistake because it didn&#x27;t hurt when i waxed my eye brows. To my surprise, it pulled off all the hair that I needed with little redness. Sensitive areas such as the bikini line and upper lip do hurt a little more of course. The reusable wax strips are very easy to clean with a little warm water. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Its works well, however the amount of wax is not sufficient to complete both legs.</li>
    <li> Works okay, love the oil it comes with.</li>
    <li> overall, i&#x27;m satisfied with this kit. for the most part, Parissa dilevered what it promised. though, i disagree with &#x27;gently lifts away hair&#x27;; by the very nature of waxing and sugaring, it wasn&#x27;t gentle - it&#x27;s ripping out hair by the roots really fast, for crying out loud.     there&#x27;s a few things to say about the negative comments about products like this .. i&#x27;ve done a lot of research into waxing and sugaring before shopping around for a kit, and found a lot of info and instructions about the process, that isn&#x27;t included in the parissa instructions.     really, you can&#x27;t put a waxing kit down for causing some pain, because hair roots have nerves, so it&#x27;ll hurt no matter what, and parissa never actually claims to be pain free. ya can&#x27;t put it down for not taking out all the hairs, when you haven&#x27;t taken all the steps to make it work right - taking a (comfortably) hot shower/bath before waxing/sugaring is critical, as it softens the hair and root; i found it the literal difference between it pulling all the hairs out, and none of the hairs.     and, finally, ya can&#x27;t put a waxing/sugaring product down for being messier than another waxing/sugaring product - it&#x27;s all about spreading hot goo on your skin with a spatula. of course it&#x27;ll be messy. just i didn&#x27;t make much of a mess at all, because i kept this in mind, and took pains to avoid a mess. if there&#x27;s gotta be a mess, sit on a towel - the great thing about sugaring like parissa&#x27;s body sugar kit, is that the paste is water soluble - it will wash out easily of the towel in the wash, and a warm watercloth will get the residue completely off the skin.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery! Got here within 3 days. :)&lt;br /&gt;This waxing kit is great! I&#x27;ve tried shaving (ouch!), several other waxing products such as Sally Hansen (bad results), and this is by far the best of everything. Since I live in a dorm, I have a smaller microwave then most, so I heated the wax for about 25s. Besides that, I followed the results exactly, and everything went smoothly! It would be nice to have more cloth strips, but when I was finished, I gently scrubbed off the wax from the used strips with warm water (took about 10 minutes for a few strips), and voila! saved myself some money. Since it&#x27;s sugar wax, it desolves in water (making an easy clean up- I kept a wet washcloth nearby for mistakes), it hurts FAR less than other waxes (it was actually kinda fun), and smells like molasses. :) Also, I took ibuprofin about half an hour before I started, and I think it really helped. Last of all, the azulene oil is super soothing, and took the redness away almost instantly.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely order this again! Thank you Parissa!</li>
    <li> Sorry....but it hurt, and I mean hurt, when I tried to do the bikini area.  Was disappointed with the purchase.</li>
    <li> And I&#x27;m very glad I found Parissa brand sugar wax.  It removes far more hair than Moom did, but washes off just as easily.  It seems stronger/thicker than the other sugar wax, so it&#x27;s more likely to pick up fine hairs as a result.  I primarily use on my upper lip, and it does a great job of removing the hair, with no irritation after.</li>
    <li> I was a waxer... I gave up the razor 2 yrs ago in preparation for my hubbys return from a deployment.  I went to the salon and had (almost) all the hairs ripped from my body.  I was addicted.  The pain was bearable... I have fine hairs (thanks to my Japanese father!) and a high pain threshold (thanks to my being a woman) and the results are amazing.  Smooth skin for weeks and when it grows back it grows back much finer so that you hardly even notice when it&#x27;s time to do it again.    But then my esthetician when on maternity leave and I didn&#x27;t want anyody else doing it (I&#x27;m a bit of a prude, you see).  So I began waxing at home.  Not so terrible.  I little more painful than professional waxing and much much messier... sooooo sticky and hard to remove from body AND surfaces!    And then I tried this sugar wax kit.  I just did my underarms and bikini region yesterday and am completely impressed.  It went on smoother and came off easier than any of the waxes I&#x27;ve tried.  And it hurt less.  It stings a little bit because you are indeed still yanking hairs from your body, but it hurt less.  Much, much less.  And this is from a person who didn&#x27;t think waxing really hurt that bad to begin with.  I experienced very little redness (if any) from sugaring as opposed to the redness (and sometimes bumpiness) I would endure after my honey or soy waxes.  I even did my upper lip and within 5 minutes any evidence of the recent hair removal was gone.  And if that isn&#x27;t great enough, clean up was a breeze.  Just hopped in a warm tub and any residue dissolved in the water.  The drips on my countertop wiped off with a hot sponge.    I will never wax again.  It is sugaring for me!!</li>
    <li> I have never done an at home product like this nor have I been so brave as to go have it done.  WOW I will never use anything else again!!!!</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  Easy to clean up since with a wet wash cloth</li>
    <li> I bougt this as a refill for Parissa&#x27;s roll-on container, which is much easier and cleaner for me to use than the wooden sticks. Coverage is great, long as I follow the directions exactly (ie, if I don&#x27;t rub it in well and zip off quickly, then not enough hair comes off). My sensitive skin tolerates Parissa products very well, especially with the azulene oil.</li>
    <li> The instructions of this package was clear, but it just didn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d expected. It was also painful to remove hair as with other waxing products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caution: Be careful not to microwave the tub of body sugar for too long, otherwise it&#x27;d be burning hot!</li>
    <li> My husband and I share this account, so for clarity, a woman is reviewing this item.&lt;br /&gt;It was very easy to learn to use the body sugar, and cleanup is really easy and quick. My first box lasted for a long time, and I didn&#x27;t hesitate to buy another when it finally got low. It comes with many reusable strips, and more of the post-wax soothing oil than I ever needed. I&#x27;ve never used any real wax products at home, so I can&#x27;t make comparisons about the amount of pain involved versus other kits, but it&#x27;s at least not more painful than getting a professional wax).</li>
    <li> I am so happy I followed the advice of other reviews.  I live in NYC and hate to throw away $100+ every month on waxing services.  I ordered this Parissa kit yesterday and it arrived a day later.  Within 5 minutes my arms were hairless.  The instructions are so easy and the cleanup is effortless.  I especially like the fact that everything can be washed and reused - strips, stirrers, and spreaders!  This is a generous amount of sugar that seems like it would last for a few months.  You can&#x27;t beat the price and the simplicity of this kit.  I hope that I have the same results on my legs when I try next week!</li>
    <li> I tried this product after having tried several different products and having had professional waxing done. This product is the most similar out of the three I tried to the professional product. (I used these products to wax my arms and legs.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was absolutely delighted by this product for these reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Best bang for your buck. The consistency of the wax is smooth and not too chunky or gummy. That means you get great bang for your buck because you can reuse the same wax on the same strip for a lot of hair. This product may be more expensive for the box, but you get much more for your money. They also don&#x27;t cheat you by giving you too few strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. My favorite: IT WASHES OFF WITH WATER!!! This wax is water-soluble, which means that you just run your legs, arms or whatever you waxed under the faucet and it comes off with little effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Minimal pain and irritation. This is a high quality wax. It got the hair off with minimal pain. I have very sensitive skin that gets irritated easily, and this wax did the job without irritating it at all. In general, I like to cut the strips in quarters because it hurts less and you get more use out of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Easy to prepare. I heated it in the microwave for 25 seconds, and it was ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. They give you plenty of strips in the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other two products I tried were: Sally Hansen Lavendar Spa Wax Hair Removal Kit and Nair Roll-on Milk and Honey Wax.&lt;br /&gt;I like the Sally Hansen because it smells great and works pretty well. The only thing is that the wax is sticky and not water-soluble, and much gummier and thicker than the Parissa. So even though it works well, it makes for a bit of a mess. And Parissa worked better.&lt;br /&gt;The Nair Roll-on Milk and Honey worked terribly for me. The roll-on thing is a good concept, but the wax itself is extremely gummy and cheap, which means that it&#x27;s hard to control and extremely painful. It also means that you can&#x27;t really reuse the same strips more than twice, so it&#x27;s not a very good value. My skin was irritated for quite a while after using it: I had red follicles for days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps you in your purchase decision. Happy waxing!</li>
    <li> The sheets are washable by hand, and easy to use wax. I used it a few times.</li>
    <li> I love this hair removal product. Very natural and smells good. Unlike some of Sally Hansen&#x27;s products that smell awful (loaded with chemicals).</li>
    <li> Brilliant stuff! When it comes to waxing and sugaring, I&#x27;m a seasoned salon goer. This stuff is saving me tons on underarm waxing and makes for a clean bikini line. I was skeptical, but this stuff is great and washes right off... Including off of the waxing strips! I will buy again and highly recommend. A little tip- buy some cheap baby powder and apply prior to hair removal :)</li>
    <li> I like this product.  I&#x27;ve switched to Moom because I think its a little cheaper even though you have to buy your own musiln strips.</li>
    <li> Good texture, but left me with bumps and ingrown hairs. I don&#x27;t usually get them when I get sugared professionally. It could just be that I am not as good at doing it as the lady&#x27;s at the salon.</li>
    <li> I have used other sugar waxes before and had ok results so I feel like I had realistic expectations,  but a strip of this took exactly 2 hairs off my leg and gave me lots of red bumps</li>
    <li> Clear directions, nice smell, lots of strips, fairly easy clean up. But it didn&#x27;t consistently remove hair from my legs so I&#x27;m searching for another alternative.</li>
    <li> I have waxed with everything.  This is my absolute favorite.  The best sugar wax by far.  the strips are reuseable, after washing in warm water.  It grabs the hairs great.  Relatively low pain, and no irritated skin afterwards.  LOVE it.  I will never use another sugar wax or even bother making my own.</li>
    <li> This is waxing not sugar</li>
    <li> Being blessed with Asian hairless legs, I only need to wax the more sensitive areas.  Sugaring supposedly uses a concoction that binds to your hair, not to your skin.  I tried this out and discovered - hardly any pain!  After a few tries, I was able to pull out all the hair in one go.  I was even confident enough to try waxing my own eyebrows.      -Warming the mix is very easy- just nuke it for 20 seconds in the microwave.  -The wax is extremely sticky, it doesn&#x27;t drip onto your clothes.  -Since it&#x27;s made of sugar, you can easily wash the stickyness off your body and reuse the cloth strips included in the package.    -SO MUCH LESS PAIN!</li>
    <li> The best hair removal product out there - it rivals the $60 treatment at the spa. The sugar rubs on and hair rips out. Nothing is completely painless, but this certainly minimizes the pain. The best part is the clean up - since it&#x27;s sugar, it washes right off with warm water. No more fighting wax remains afterwards.</li>
    <li> Works quite well. I imagine it will get better as I practice or use it more. Love that it&#x27;s natural &amp; good for sensitive skin. I actually used it on my face.</li>
    <li> I have used many waxes and this one is the best. None irritating, washes off easily with water and is the least difficult to work with, in terms of consistency, when heated properly.  I have even used this brand but products that were not water soluble and they just don&#x27;t compare.  This product gets 5 stars even though it deserves 10!</li>
    <li> The price is reasonable and the sugaring ok. The strips provided are not cloth. They are not flexible. Try as I might I couldn&#x27;t get them to adhere to the areas I was trying to remove hair from. I purchased primarily for facial hair removal. Alternate products provide cloth strips which conform to any area. The strips that are included may work for large flatter areas, I can&#x27;t say.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t  try it, made my the ares half done and broke out in rash.</li>
    <li> Maybe its because I don&#x27;t know what i&#x27;m doing. I tried it twice couldnt get one spot on my leg completely smooth and now im over it. Haven&#x27;t used it since.</li>
    <li> Although the strips that came with this were great and rewashable, this sugar did not work as good as Moom. The thinner the spread, the better it pulls off the skin. I have coarse dark hair and it works great even  my legs. I bled a tiny bit but after a day or two the bumps have gone away and the soon it&#x27;s super smooth. MUST follow with the Azulene spray.</li>
    <li> If you are a beginner in waxing , this one will definitely work, u can heat it in the microwave, and its washable and easy to use</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years now.  It is amazing.</li>
    <li> This works ok but you have to get the sugar the right temp and consistency. 20 seconds works in my microwave.&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my face, and the redness afterwards is minimal.  i usually do this at night and by morning the redness is gone. It is messy but that is to be expected. i bought a pack of craft sticks at the dollar store (which resemble popsicle sticks) to use with it, since it only came with a few stirs.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s extremely effective and as gentle as ripping out hair can get. I use this all the time</li>
    <li> Okay, I have never had a salon wax and I have never purchased a waxing product.  Well I used to take baths everyday and could easily see where I shaving on my legs.  Since my fiance and I now have only one bathroom, I am forced to take showers now instead of baths as he comes home quite dirty.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Since I have been shaving my legs in the shower, I accidently started to shave up to high, about three inches below my thighs.  I didn&#x27;t realize that I was shaving too high by the way.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;While still being oblivious to this fact, I started shaving my legs with a cutoff point.  Once I did that, I had courser and darker hair grow in around my upper thighs.  It would have been a bad decision to just keep shaving this area. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My fiance said, \\&quot;Why don&#x27;t you just bleach it?\\&quot;  I did not want to do that as the hair was somewhat course and I wanted results that would last longer.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Well after reading some reviews on the Internet about Parissa waxing products, I got the sugar waxing sytem by Parissa.  This product worked EXCELLENT.  It did not hurt &amp; to be honest, I actually found it kind of fun, as with each strip I tore I saw a lot of hair and was like, \\&quot;WOW.\\&quot;   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I had red bumps where I had sugar waxed for about 24 hours.  DO NOT USE ON A DAY THAT YOU PLAN ON SHOWING YOUR LEGS OR ANY OTHER AREA, AS IT TAKES ABOUT 24 HOURS FOR THE REDNESS TO GO AWAY.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I met with my hair stylist yesterday and told her about it.  She performs waxes in her shop all the time.  I told her about my results and she was like, \\&quot;no way.\\&quot;  I told her \\&quot;yes way\\&quot; and also mentioned the azalune oil that comes with it and she said that this oil is great to use after waxing.  She was surprised that an over the counter waxing product came with this oil.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, this product worked great on me.  Definitely will buy again.</li>
    <li> takes off the hair and easy to use. i like that you can reuse the strips and the wax washes right off.</li>
    <li> I think this might be as good as it get in terms of self-waxing. Plus it&#x27;s natural.</li>
    <li> great wax!! lose sugar wax now. its easy and less painful except for underarms (mines hurt regardless of the wax.)</li>
    <li> The advantage to this product is that it&#x27;s not messy or hard to remove like most hot waxes I&#x27;ve tried.  The disadvantage is that it only removed the finer hairs, and left ALL of the coarse hairs that I was really trying to remove.  If you have thinner body hair I would highly recommend this product, but it&#x27;s definitely not for all hair types.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve found this body sugar works as well as salon waxing.  I use it for legs and underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;time of month&amp;#34; seems to make a big difference--I think hormonal changes in hair and skin affect the process.  During my period my skin is much more sensitive.  If I wax/sugar then, I tend to get a lot of redness, slight bleeding and ingrown hairs.  Midcycle works best: no bleeding, no ingrown hairs.  Sorry this is kind of graphic, but hope it helps!</li>
    <li> Easy to use and easy clean up. I don&#x27;t have a microwave so I placed the tub on top of an upside down sushi soy sauce dish (didn&#x27;t want to place directly on the bottom of the pot) in a pot of hot water and it warmed up eventually. Waxed my bikini line for the first time and I was surprised that it didn&#x27;t hurt too much. Great at home product and I love that the strips are washable and reusable.</li>
    <li> I used this to wax my eyebrows. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever get a professional eyebrow waxing again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Painless and fast, but messy. :)</li>
    <li> This wax is great.  I used to be afraid of waxing because it hurt so much.  I heard about sugar wax and tried to make my own.  After several failed attempts to make my own I decided to buy this.  One jar of this wax lasts me a very long time-- so long that I run out of strips (You need strips for this wax.  It&#x27;s not the kind of sugar wax that you can rip off with your hands, as far as I know).  When I run out of strips I go to Walmart and buy some discount polyester cloth from the fabric section for like $3 a yard-- it does the job perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this wax is great.  It&#x27;s easy to use, it doesn&#x27;t need to be scalding hot, it doesn&#x27;t rip off my skin, and it washes off with water.  I would recommend it to anybody.</li>
    <li> THOROUGHLY CLEAN YOUR SKIN BEFORE AND AFTER AND I HIGHLY RECOMMEND USING A TONER AFTERWARD</li>
    <li> Great product. Easy to use and best of all - it&#x27;s water soluble/sugar based so Very Easy to Clean up! The strips are washable and reusable. And... A little goes a long way so should last for quiet a while...</li>
    <li> made me break out very bad!</li>
    <li> I absolutely adored this product! Of course, it only truly works well for fine hairs, thick ones need wax! But for fine hairs that you want to (almost) painlessly remove, this product is perfect! I recommend Parissa products to all my friends and this one is no exception!</li>
    <li> I bought this and the Persian Cold Wax, I liked the hold on this better; took less tries on tough hair. Love that its washable saves money if you take the time to wash the strips. As the other wax it is good for home care removal but not as tough as salon wax.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a first timer - and it was horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend paying some one who knows what they&#x27;re doing to apply this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following were my sad results using it for the first time, specifically on hair in the bikini region --&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT HURTS - For a couple seconds.  The pain does go away almost immediately if you use the warm shower technique (or I just sat in our complex&#x27;s jacuzzi before removing the hair).  But the quick pain is so excruciating that I really don&#x27;t want to go back to do it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WAS LEFT WITH RED BUMPS / INGROWN HAIR - I used the fluid in the blue bottle; didn&#x27;t work on my skin.. Bikini rash for a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CAN&#x27;T REUSE STRIPS -  HAIR and wax on strip was disgusting. I can&#x27;t imagine how people are cleaning these strips in their sinks to re-use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DOES NOT ALL ZIP-OFF IN ONE PULL FOR THIS FIRST TIMER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BECOMES A MESS AS COOLS OFF -  I had honey-like strands of syrupy goo stretching from the container to my leg as it cooled..  Have lots of paper towels under and around this and your legs if you decide to do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;..the other two times I&#x27;ll update this review.  As for now -  I&#x27;m sticking with shaving until something less painful comes along.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and it got here so fast! It takes out all the dark coarse hairs, but I have really thick hair so I usually go over once and then wait a week before going over again. Heats quickly, is seemingly odorless and doesn&#x27;t give me a rash, unlike every other over the counter body care product. Props to Parissa.</li>
    <li> I love this product, and the fact that it is washable.  I wouldn&#x27;t purchase anything else or another brand - I&#x27;ve been using Parissa for over 10 years.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I bought this with my underarms in mind since shaving gives me razor burn and ingrowns (no matter what razor or cream or tactics I use). I had gotten some waxing done at a salon but was unhappy with the cost of having 4 quick motions made. The directions for this were very easy to follow, the 15 second microwave time was perfect, and the waxing was quick and easy. The sugar wax easily washes off in the shower or even with a cool damp cloth, and the azulene oil really does help to soothe afterwards. My absolute favorite part about this kit is that the cloths can be washed and reused! I soak them in the sink and rub off the sugar and hair and put them up to dry. I will note that I do have a high pain tolerance (I got wax happy the first time of using this and did my stomach and arms even though they don&#x27;t really need waxing), but I felt the same, if not less, amount of discomfort as I did at the salon. I even did my own Brazilian today after getting brave and realized that I no longer have to spend oodles of money at the waxing salon every month. I am calling to cancel my appointments tomorrow!</li>
    <li> Have not tried it yet but am looking forward yo using this product. I think it will do what I&#x27;m looking for according to the other reviews!</li>
    <li> Parissa body sugar scrub is awesome.  My hair is curly and course.  I used this for the random neck whiskers I have and it stripped everything!!  Easy clean up with water; it is basically a sugar wax do it dissolves off of the skin with hot water and any other surface it spilled on.  Simple application. 2 thumbs up.</li>
    <li> It is fine for a simple bikini wax, but did nothing for my leg hairs. I liked the cleanliness and ease of the strips compared to Cocojo, but Cocojo did a much better job of removing hair.</li>
    <li> liked it. It is easy to use compared to the other brands I have. I would order more when mine is finished.</li>
    <li> Great product. Easy to use and clean up is a breeze, washes away in seconds.</li>
    <li> Best  I&#x27;ve used and I have tried many, very easy to apply and clean up. Works wonderfully!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried their &amp;#34;Warm Wax&amp;#34;, but I wasn&#x27;t completely sold on this product. I hated getting wax on everything I mistakenly touched, while cleaning up. I wanted to try sugar wax, so that I can easily clean up afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really liked the product once I got used to it--getting the consistency correct, and finding the best &amp;#34;ripping&amp;#34; method. I use it on my leg hair that, unfortunately, has coarse hair. There&#x27;s very little pain when waxing, and does a good job of getting most of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend others to try it.</li>
    <li> The product worked better than expected.  This is my first time using a sugar wax and I was very pleased with the results. I have used regular wax stripes in the best and this is a less painful way to go, not to mention you have get more productive  for your money spent.  It is very sticky so you have to use it in small quantities.  Additionally the applicator stick and cloth pull strips are required for ease and less mess.</li>
    <li> I have been sugared many times and get sick of paying for it, so I bought this. NOT THE SAME! I bought the warmer, and the sugar never got to the correct temp, I guess, because I could not get my hair off. I ended up with a sticky, swollen leg in this case. At least sugar rinses off, but this did not work for me at all.</li>
