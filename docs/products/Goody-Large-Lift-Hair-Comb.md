    <li> I&#x27;d been searching high and low for a plastic goody pick after I lost my one I had for 12 years and finally found this one.  I love it!  This is not the cheaper plastic ones that have sharp points and hurt your head.  I have thick, curly hair and this is the only thing that can take the tangles out after a shower without killing my head.  So happy I finally found it....there aren&#x27;t many out there like this anymore!</li>

    <li> Actually got this for our daughter&#x27;s hair which is fine, straight yet she has a lot of it. Her hair tends to get tangled easily and some of the combs just weren&#x27;t helping.
