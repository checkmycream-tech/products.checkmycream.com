      <li>Love my bath pillow.</li>
      <li>After bathing and a good soak, my neck and back feels great.  </li>
      <li>Had it for about a week now :)</li>
      <li>but I am sure that she will.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t say for sure how she likes it</li>
      <li>Love this thing.</li>
      <li>I love this pillow.</li>
      <li>and I LOVE this pillow.</li>
      <li>We love it and the sponges were a great little bonus price good and made an enjoyable Christmas gift, too</li>
      <li>It makes my tub 100% more comfortable.</li>
      <li>, I truly enjoy my air jet tub as it was meant to be enjoyed - in luxury and comfort.</li>
      <li>It is also the most comfortable pillow I have ever had.</li>
      <li>this bath pillow is so comfortable I now enjoy soaking in my tub more than ever.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Dries quickly, vert comfy!</li>
      <li>It is so comfortable.  </li>
      <li>It can be fully submerged and is machine washable (the original reason I chose it).  </li>
      <li>Comfortable and dries quick.</li>
      <li>It dries quickly just as thr description says.</li>
      <li>It is sturdy and very comfy, super easy to use and take care of.</li>
      <li>I love the fact that there are no uncomfortable seams that poke sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve looked for a long time for a bath pillow that is convenient, easy to use, and comfortable.  </li>
      <li>However, I&#x27;m ok with that, because it means I can choose a neck specific pillow.</li>
      <li>This one really fits the bill!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s double the size of the others I tried, the contours are comfortable, and it&#x27;s soft yet supportive.  </li>
      <li>When taking a bath, the pillow soaks up the hot water which applies heat to the back of my neck and shoulders for a most therapeutic treatment.  </li>
      <li>The pillow is soft and comfortable.  </li>
      <li>The suction cups adhere fine for me, but they work best if you dampen them and then push them down hard before running the bath.</li>
      <li>It is easy to attach to the back of the tub.  </li>
      <li>it eventually got very moldy on the backside and I had to throw it</li>
      <li>I actually use it more as a back and neck rest than for my head.  </li>
      <li>I have bought several different types over the years because I love to relax in the bath.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not cold to the touch when you lean back like</li>
      <li>it fits just right to my tub and fast dry, the suction up holds well</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s large, but not quite large enough to allow me to lounge comfortably in my straight back basin tub.</li>
      <li>and I can slide it up and down to fit my head</li>
      <li>It is such a vast improvement over the blow up type that eventually and quickly develop leaks...</li>
      <li>And it dries completely overnight</li>
      <li>When I&#x27;m done using it, I simply balance it above the tub spout and the water quickly drains out and it is always completely dry by the next morning (likely much sooner)</li>
      <li>This pillow is the perfect solution for the little knob on the base of your skull that nothing but a cushiony softness can support in the bath.</li>

    <li> the only pillow that actually sticks in my tub and it is very comfortable!!!</li>
    <li> the suction cups don&#x27;t stay and it slowly slides down the tub as you lean on it.  I haven&#x27;t found one yet that works.  the search continues.</li>
    <li> Love my bath pillow. It is sturdy and very comfy, super easy to use and take care of. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Have tried 2 or 3 different type pillows for our jacuzzi bathtub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is by far the best one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dries quickly, vert comfy!</li>
    <li> We love it and the sponges were a great little bonus price good and made an enjoyable Christmas gift, too</li>
    <li> This was a gift to my daughter and she is looking forward to using it so I can&#x27;t say for sure how she likes it but I am sure that she will.</li>
    <li> A gift that was well received.</li>
    <li> I have a ridiculously uncomfortable bath tub and have tried a couple other pillows.  One was inflatable, oddly shaped and a pain in the rear to use.  Another was okay, but very small with a surface that stuck to my skin a little.. it eventually got very moldy on the backside and I had to throw it (should have cleaned it regularly, I suppose).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS pillow is awesome!  It&#x27;s double the size of the others I tried, the contours are comfortable, and it&#x27;s soft yet supportive.  I actually use it more as a back and neck rest than for my head.  It&#x27;s not cold to the touch when you lean back like some are.  It can be fully submerged and is machine washable (the original reason I chose it).  When I&#x27;m done using it, I simply balance it above the tub spout and the water quickly drains out and it is always completely dry by the next morning (likely much sooner) if I&#x27;ve taken a bath in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downfall to this pillow is the suction cups.  There are only two and they sit in the center, and seem to be recessed just a little due to the pillow contours.  So, they don&#x27;t always stick properly.  However, I&#x27;ve had trouble with suction cups on every bath pillow I&#x27;ve tried, and even when they&#x27;re not working on this one, the pillow is still large enough and comfortable enough that it&#x27;s basically irrelevant for me.  Love this thing.</li>
    <li> this bath pillow is so comfortable I now enjoy soaking in my tub more than ever.  The other pillows I had were the plastic type that got sweaty, etc.  This pillow is wonderful, dries out great and I am very glad II purchased it.</li>
    <li> it fits just right to my tub and fast dry, the suction up holds well and I can slide it up and down to fit my head</li>
    <li> I am a huge bath enthusiast and this is the best bath pillow I have ever bought. Since it is neither foam nor blowup, it does not puncture nor retain tons of water. It dries quickly just as thr description says. It is also the most comfortable pillow I have ever had. I absolutely love it. The loofah and sponge are a nice plus and make this a great gift set. I plan to buy several for Christmas.</li>
    <li> It is so comfortable.  I hope it lasts a while.</li>
    <li> Good for the bath but not for a spa.</li>
    <li> The pillow is soft and comfortable.  I would give it five stars but the suction cups don&#x27;t hold as well as I would like.  I love the fact that there are no uncomfortable seams that poke sensitive skin.  I have bought several different types over the years because I love to relax in the bath.  This is the best so far.</li>
    <li> Great for my derriere in the tube.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable and a nice addition to our tub.</li>
    <li> poor neck support, rough material, I don&#x27;t recommend this product for the price</li>
    <li> I bought this bath pillow on a whim.  I found it to be excellent.  I suffer neck strain with pinched nerves.  When taking a bath, the pillow soaks up the hot water which applies heat to the back of my neck and shoulders for a most therapeutic treatment.  After bathing and a good soak, my neck and back feels great.  It is easy to attach to the back of the tub.  The suction pads stick even under water.  A great find and buy.</li>
    <li> I gotta say, I am 4&#x27;11 and have a bad back from an automobile accident last year and I LOVE this pillow.It makes my tub 100% more comfortable. Comfortable and dries quick. Had it for about a week now :)</li>
    <li> This pillow is the perfect solution for the little knob on the base of your skull that nothing but a cushiony softness can support in the bath. The pillow absorbs water (without being heavy), but sheds the water after use. Just set it to drain and air dry. It is luxurious and moveable to attain the perfect comfortable support of your head. Air pillows do not cradle the head - this pillow does.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I truly enjoy my air jet tub as it was meant to be enjoyed - in luxury and comfort.</li>
    <li> I love this pillow. It is such a vast improvement over the blow up type that eventually and quickly develop leaks... And it dries completely overnight so no worries about mildewed foam!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve looked for a long time for a bath pillow that is convenient, easy to use, and comfortable.  This one really fits the bill!</li>
    <li> Both my husband and myself found this pillow everything we had hoped for.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s large, but not quite large enough to allow me to lounge comfortably in my straight back basin tub. It can support my back well enough but is too short to also support my neck, so I will need a combo of two different pillows. However, I&#x27;m ok with that, because it means I can choose a neck specific pillow. The suction cups adhere fine for me, but they work best if you dampen them and then push them down hard before running the bath. I often have trouble removing them afterwards!</li>
