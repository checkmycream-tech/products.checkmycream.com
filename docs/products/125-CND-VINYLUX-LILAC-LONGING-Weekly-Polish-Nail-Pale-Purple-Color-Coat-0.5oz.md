      <li>Nice color, goes on smooth and lasts a long time without chipping or fading.</li>
      <li>Love, love the nail polish looks very nice on my complexion, got a few compliments from only wearing it once....</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this is a good polish, it&#x27;s just not as good as it CND promised.  </li>
      <li>Best polish ever dries in less than 10 min and last two weeks with out chips or bubbling.</li>
      <li>It really does stay on without chipping for a full week.  </li>
      <li>Just follow the process of applying it to clean, dry nails, follow 2 color coats with 1 coat of the Vinylux Weekly Top Coat.  </li>
      <li>It worked pretty well (like others described) for 3 applications.</li>
      <li>but I still love that it last for days</li>
      <li>Using the CND Vinylux, I am able to change my color anytime with regular polish remover.</li>
      <li>It goes on much smoother!</li>
      <li>I believe this product does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
      <li>Really pop for the Spring/Summer!</li>
      <li>have this polish in 9 colors and absolutely am hooked!</li>
      <li>The color was very vibrant</li>
      <li>I applied a single color coat and top coat, just because I had a event on Friday.  </li>
      <li>Beautiful manicure, dry and set, in less than 30 minutes.  </li>
      <li>and it really lasts and lasts.</li>
      <li>I recommend buffing your nails really well before applying the color.</li>
      <li>but by then I was ready to change the color anyway.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like it.</li>
      <li>It really adheres to the nail</li>
      <li>Color was a brite lilac very springy</li>
      <li>Love the color, it lasted more than other brands but not exactly one week</li>
      <li>The only issue i have with this is i do not think its true to color (in the picture and in person).</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this brand.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Comparable price to regular polish so worth getting.</li>
      <li>love that this polish dries fast and hard like the gel without using the UV lights to &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Easy &amp; long lasting.  </li>
      <li>but they do last more than conventional nail polishes.</li>
      <li>Seems like a cheap quality of brush which make applying the nail polish uneven.</li>
      <li>I kept the bottle out of direct sunlight and followed the directions, but somehow the formula changed.</li>
      <li>I use the top coat with my OPI and Essie Polishes and it lasts at least a week.</li>
      <li>it dries and hardens with natural light.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Lasts about a week on my nails if you put a second coat of top coat after a few days.</li>
      <li>This is such a different and pretty color.  </li>
      <li>On day 5 I usually see tiny chipping, but its ok, since I wash and scrub all the time.</li>
      <li>Much better results than other brands I have previously used.</li>
      <li>As with all of the Vinylux it dries fast and wears a long time!</li>
      <li>This polish is great, I have several colors, this particular color is a little difficult for me to apply</li>
      <li>My manicures, even when following their instructions to a tee, do not last a complete week when using Vinylux.  </li>
      <li>Shake it well, or it gets thick quickly.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> color as pictured; matte finish</li>
    <li> This polish is amazing!!! It lasted 10 days with no chipping.</li>
    <li> These only last a day or so for me.</li>
    <li> Color was a brite lilac very springy</li>
    <li> It came with no brush so can not use it</li>
    <li> This polish is great, I have several colors, this particular color is a little difficult for me to apply but I still love that it last for days</li>
    <li> Love, love the nail polish looks very nice on my complexion, got a few compliments from only wearing it once....</li>
    <li> Best polish ever dries in less than 10 min and last two weeks with out chips or bubbling. Last longer than shellac! And no UV light needed!!!!!</li>
    <li> I took this polish when I got my manicure. It&#x27;s now been a week and I have one chipped nail. I&#x27;m going to leave it on for another week and see how many chipped nails I will have. This polish has definitely plasted longer than OPI polish.</li>
    <li> I have been using VinylLux polish for about six months.  It really does stay on without chipping for a full week.  When it starts to chip at the end of the week, I suggest you remove it immediately.  It really adheres to the nail so there is the danger of pealing once it starts to chip.  I love this color.</li>
    <li> This was a good polish and I love the CND vinylux weekly polishes. The only issue i have with this is i do not think its true to color (in the picture and in person). Its not as bright as the picture, more dingy. Not a bad color at all, I still like it just wish it was brighter.</li>
    <li> CND is my latest, favorite brand of polish (OPI #2). It lasts about 4-5 days without any touchup. I&#x27;m very hard on my polish since I cook almost daily and I do my pots/pans by hand.</li>
    <li> Have used this product&lt;br /&gt;Before. When applied w the top coat, it is excellent. My pedi lasts for 2-4 weeks.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like it. I need a long-lasting, non-gel formula I can use myself... It worked pretty well (like others described) for 3 applications. I kept the bottle out of direct sunlight and followed the directions, but somehow the formula changed. Every applications is so tacky and gummy, it doesn&#x27;t come close to drying, even when I &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; my nails in sunlight.  (I did not use a base either).</li>
    <li> I like this polish a lot.  The color is as shown and lasts a week on my hands and a month on my toes before it starts chipping.</li>
    <li> Very great polish. Lasts a long time. Much better results than other brands I have previously used. I highly recommend this brand. I like the color also.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing and it&#x27;s the perfect purple. I use the top coat with my OPI and Essie Polishes and it lasts at least a week.</li>
    <li> Nice color, goes on smooth and lasts a long time without chipping or fading. Love it, I am officially a Vinylux fan.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t last quite a week with zero chips but the wear was minuscule. I love it. The color is beautiful and is as pictured. Easily removed, no UV light required for salon quality gel polish. I will be ordering other colors!!</li>
    <li> I believe this product does exactly what it says it will do. I love the shellac polish but it can be expensive and you are stuck with the color for 2 weeks. Using the CND Vinylux, I am able to change my color anytime with regular polish remover. The color was very vibrant and I got a lot of compliments on it. I gave it 4 stars because about the 5th day I had to retouch the tips but by then I was ready to change the color anyway. I will be ordering more colors.</li>
    <li> Love this!  Easy &amp; long lasting.  I can get 4-5 days w/o chipping.  Easy to apply.</li>
    <li> This lasts for more than a week!  It is such a nice and rich tone.  A little darker than lilac.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this nail polish after a coworker had sworn by it! Her nails always look amazing, so I bought two colors, the top coat and the scrub. I have a horrible time keeping nail polish on and my nails never grow. The polish went out great and and looked really great for three days. Then chipped off like the rest.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color, and dries really quick&#x3D; my new favorite nail polish!!!</li>
    <li> I am allergic to gel and shellac at the salon so this is a perfect alternative! this polish lasts several days longer than OPI without chipping and losing shine.  the lighter colors I can wear easily as long as 10 days without looking bad and the darker colors I can go about 7-10 days with a little touch up to last longer. OPI usually only lasts about 5 days without chipping or fading in color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that this polish dries fast and hard like the gel without using the UV lights to &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34;. it dries and hardens with natural light.&lt;br /&gt;I have this polish in 9 colors and absolutely am hooked!</li>
    <li> Very happy with how long it stays on!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fun and it lasts with the top coat (CND Vinylux) - I use it more on toes than fingers since I am not a &amp;#34;wild color on the hands&amp;#34; person. But I&#x27;ve been known to use it for a weekend color just for a little more of a funky look than usual!!! It&#x27;s not gray at all - a problem with some lilacs and lavenders.</li>
    <li> This color is beautiful. but it does chip.  I don&#x27;t think it made it to 5 days.  lasted longer on toe nails.</li>
    <li> Does stay longer than regular polish. Not 7 days though. I am sure it has a lot to do with the thickness and condition of your nails. Mine are weak and thin. Comparable price to regular polish so worth getting.</li>
    <li> This Vinylux lilac polish is a wonderful color.  I wore it on my feet all summer.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color! On day 5 I usually see tiny chipping, but its ok, since I wash and scrub all the time. For me 5 day staying power is great! Easy to apply and dries in 15 minutes. I recommend buffing your nails really well before applying the color. It goes on much smoother! I already ordered Lobster Roll and Pink Bikini along with Lilac Longing.</li>
    <li> This is such a different and pretty color.  Really pop for the Spring/Summer! Lasts about a week on my nails if you put a second coat of top coat after a few days.</li>
    <li> like it, its not amazing, it lasts like normal polish.... just a little bit stronger</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this is a good polish, it&#x27;s just not as good as it CND promised.  My manicures, even when following their instructions to a tee, do not last a complete week when using Vinylux.  Like I said, it is a good nail polish, it&#x27;s just not as good as promised.</li>
    <li> I love the color no complains it&#x27;s just very pretty and cute</li>
    <li> This is amazing stuff.  Add a sparkle top coat and it really lasts and lasts.</li>
    <li> As described, Beautiful color thanks.</li>
    <li> Shake it well, or it gets thick quickly.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t last a week but they do last more than conventional nail polishes. The color is beautiful specially for spring</li>
    <li> The polish itself is good, but the brush isn&#x27;t.  Seems like a cheap quality of brush which make applying the nail polish uneven.</li>
    <li> Love the color, it lasted more than other brands but not exactly one week</li>
    <li> Great for leaving it for more than one week!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and great price! This is a lovely summer color, not to pale and not too bright.  Just perfect. As with all of the Vinylux it dries fast and wears a long time! Perfect!</li>
    <li> Just follow the process of applying it to clean, dry nails, follow 2 color coats with 1 coat of the Vinylux Weekly Top Coat.  Beautiful manicure, dry and set, in less than 30 minutes.  It is a lovely color for spring and the coverage is excellent.  I applied it on Sunday.  On Thursday, there were no chips but just some slight wear at the end of my nails (I type all day).  I applied a single color coat and top coat, just because I had a event on Friday.  On Saturday, my nails still look great!</li>
