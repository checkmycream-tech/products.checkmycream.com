      <li>I really like these vitamins!</li>
      <li>This stuff really works!</li>
      <li>Only reason I am giving this product a 4/5 is because Im not too sure of the doasge amounts for the greentea and etc and what the equivalents are .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Thankfully my skin did not experience any breakouts, just smooth and clear...</li>
      <li>Came super fast, easy for me to swallow...will be back in a month for hair update</li>
      <li>Although I took the vitamins during my protective styling period, once I took my hair down I was definitely pleased with the amount of growth in 1 month!</li>
      <li>had to stop, because my hair not only got either ever more dry &amp; even more oily, but my face broke out immensly.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These vitamins have my nails strong as ever! I plan on purchasing another bottle after removing my protective style. My skin is also smoother than usual and my face has a gorgeous glow. I really like these vitamins!</li>
    <li> I got this product last month.  I am very pleased with the results so far.  However, I&#x27;, almost out and need to reorder. I&#x27;m saddened that it&#x27;s currently unavailable</li>
    <li> Excellent. Ready to re-order. Package, timing, price are all great and there was a sweet personal note on the invoice and a smiley! :)</li>
    <li> No more splitting nails and hair grows like crazy.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I received this product a couple months ago and since then I have been hooked! This product was nicely packaged and it even came with a little note from the seller wishing me luck on my hair journey! Then as time passed I noticed my hair growing like crazy! My skin looks so healthy and clear as well. I recently did the big chop on my hair and was so excited to get my natural hair growing. I take these supplements with the bamboo tea and I am very pleased. Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> Incredible product,  my hair feels fuller and looks healthier than it has in a while</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t found another product like it, My hair is growing so quickly, but it makes the hair grow EVERYWHERE. THe only downfall is my curl pattern is changing.</li>
    <li> I just finished the bottle and my nails have definitely grown out a lot. I really don&#x27;t see a difference in my hair though. Price isn&#x27;t bad though and Shipping was great. There is no weird odor or taste so overall I was pleased.</li>
    <li> Love the product hair hair is growing and there&#x27;s a major difference in the shedding . I take in conjunction with the tea. I love them both! Will be ordering a 3 month supply soon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these vitamins for 2 weeks today (I started March 1st) and I must say, I like these vitamins. I washed my hair today and after I allowed it to air dry a little bit before braiding my hair up in 6 sections, I did a small length check and my hair grew ½ an inch! Now before I started my 6 month Beautifully Bamboo Challenge, I needed 1 inch to make APL at the front and the back. Now it seems like I need less than that! I will be taking these vitamins for the next 5½ months and I hope that they help me reach my goals of APL by June 2015 and BSL by December 2015. I&#x27;m hoping I get a extra inch or so to make me closer to my goal. I will be relaxing my hair soon and I hope to be grazing APL. I might end up needing to trim my ends, but I hope not. Anyway, these vitamins seems to be helping. I also started using Tea Tree Oil which also promotes hair growth by cleaning and clarifying the scalp of anything hindering it of achieving it&#x27;s maximum growth rate. These vitamins are easy to swallow and are in capsule form. I have 2 more weeks to go before I finish my 1st bottle and I start the 2nd one in April.</li>
    <li> Great. I would recommend .</li>
    <li> This pill works wonders along with the bamboo tea , my hair has been growing faster .. A must try</li>
    <li> Love it!! Skin, hair and nails never looked better. Will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> I have taken a lot of different supplements to maintain my hair , nails and skin and by far this one is the best. I have been on my healthy hair journey for 3 years now and these vitamins have made my hair and nails stronger in the three months I have been taking them. I have not really noticed any boost in growth (my growth is about 1/2 inch to an inch a month) but the density of the hair. I love these supplements.</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with this product and the tea as well. Thank you for fast delivery.</li>
    <li> just started taking these vitamins i can already tell a difference in my hair no more shedding when brush or comb it out the pills are pretty big so i just take one at a time because taking two all together is risky</li>
    <li> My hair is thicker and healthier. I haven&#x27;t seen much growth, but quality has improved</li>
    <li> My dermatologist (who specializes in hair loss) advised me to take this product to treat my thinning, shedding hair.  A month and a half later, my hair has grown, has virtually stopped falling out, it seems to be thicker and and is much healthier.  I have to qualify this by saying I am doing several things at the same time to achieve these results.  Therefore, I am not sure what to attribute the turn around to...one thing or many.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems pricy (in my opinion) and the shipping charge is a bite, but when I reordered, I purchased two bottles and they shipped both bottles for the price of one!  Plus sent a hand-written note of thanks with my second order. Simple things like that that make me feel like my business is appreciated and valued. It also is indicative of a company that takes pride in their product.  A big positive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong. Each capsule is filled with &amp;#34;good for you&amp;#34; ingredients.  I highly recommend Beautifully Bamboo.</li>
    <li> Thank you soooo much Beautifully Bamboo for such an amazing product!! Before using this product the length of my hair seem to stay the same, after using BB ultra vitamins my hair and my nails have grown so much since I started using this product in February 2015. This product was just the boost my hair needed. Thankfully my skin did not experience any breakouts, just smooth and clear... I love love the sweet Happy Hair Growing message!!! Please don&#x27;t change this product or the price. LOL</li>
    <li> Not sure yet....so far it&#x27;s only been a few days. These pills are a bit acidic for me, causes upset stomach. So I&#x27;m taking with milk or any food product with milk to help ease the discomfort. I believe it&#x27;s the cayenne pepper in the product.</li>
    <li> after a month,well, my nails are stronger( i drink also the bamboo tea) but still there are some of them broken maybe i should wait for the old nails to get rid of them?.&lt;br /&gt;skin i see no differences, it says it got collagen 1&amp;3 but i see no huge changes, but i love how i have one bottle that got all vits and bamboo amd collagen togather. for my hair i did a bang really short  month ago ( not touching my brows) i can see that it got long now touching my eyelashes ! :)&lt;br /&gt;my hair looks fuller but not long though, i just ordered the second bottle</li>
    <li> I actually do see a difference in using this product. I have always had flimsy fingernails, for which the Sally Hansen stuff of the 70&#x27;s did nothing. Yeah, that makes me old. I&#x27;ve been using it for about two or three weeks now. My hair seems a lot fuller, too. I&#x27;ll be ordering another bottle.</li>
    <li> Cannot wait to see results.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Love these vitamins there easy to take I didn&#x27;t get any breakouts and my hair grew close to an inch shipping was fast and compared to other vitamins I&#x27;ve taken these are the best already started on my second bottle I well keep taking them</li>
    <li> Will purchase again !!! Forever !</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd bottle and I have to say at first I was a little nervous thinking that I might break out with having biotin and msm in it, but I have not had any bad reactions to it. In fact I have seen nothing but positive results my nails and hair are growing very quickly!</li>
    <li> Completely unsatisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have curly hair, it tends to get very dry or too oily, and never grew; which is why I bought this product.&lt;br /&gt;I had to stop, because my hair not only got either ever more dry &amp; even more oily, but my face broke out immensly. I honestly, maybe get one or two pimples, but i broke out SO MUCH. All on my cheeks, chin, it was terrible.&lt;br /&gt;I give it the stars I did because of the shipment and the no taste.&lt;br /&gt;would not reccomend.</li>
    <li> Worked great! My nail grew like crazy. Hair started to become strong and had less shedding! Skin seemed to have less breakouts</li>
    <li> My hair grow isn&#x27;t working.</li>
    <li> I a have been using this product for a few days and I have to say already I love it, unlike most it is not breaking me out and that means I cant stick to it. so happy to know it is this good. And my nails are growing and strong can&#x27;t wait to see my hair at the end of the next six weeks.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t taken these very long so the verdict is still out on hair growth.  I have noticed growth and strength in my nails.  I do like that this supplement has alot of the supplements needed for hair growth.  I was taking many of these individually and now I can just take this supplement. I&#x27;ll update later after I have been on them a while.  The seller is really nice</li>
    <li> I have only been taking this supplement for a month abd,so far I haven&#x27;t seen any results but I will update my review in another month</li>
    <li> As I said in the Bamboo tea this product work so well with it . My hair grew twice as fast and also thicken my hair. My face is so smooth and I look years younger and my nails have gotten so long and strong. Please try this product  you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Works well hair is growing silky and shiny.</li>
    <li> so I just started yesterday.. How long will it be before I see results? Only giving it one star cause I haven&#x27;t seen results for myself yet.</li>
    <li> Great product I just finished my first 30 days. I had to cut my nails twice, my skin look beautiful I can not say nothing about my hair yet because I haven&#x27;t measured it yet but I can honestly say I feel new growth. This product really do what the label claim. I like it and I will definitely recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin so soft, thinning hair, not sure it works for that, which I was hoping it would.</li>
    <li> Its okay not a huge difference in my hair</li>
    <li> Great product would recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> They work! My hair dont fall as much while taking this product.</li>
    <li> I am quite impressed with the Beautiful Bamboo supplements (I also bought the corresponding tea too and will do a review)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the last couple of years, my hair has been thinning a lot (due to stress mostly) and I feel that these supplements do make a difference...my hair is a bit easier to style...it seems like it&#x27;s growing more and it looks thicker...I started taking the supplements on April 11th and it&#x27;s now May 9th and this morning I just picked up my 2nd order  with this company because I didn&#x27;t want to be without them...I&#x27;ve tried a lot of hair, skin and nail supplements but I feel like the Beautifully Bamboo brand is truly making a difference...by the way, I am not growing hair in weird places like somebody else mentioned...lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, as mentioned in another review, it&#x27;s sure a nice surprise to get a hand written note on your invoice thanking you for your purchase...as I mentioned, I wanted to continue using these supplements so I ordered  a couple more months so as not to interrupt my Bamboo regiment and to my shock on the receipt, they acknowledged that fact that I am a repeat customer...small things like that show you that their company cares...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I supplement these pills with the Bamboo Tea...granted I don&#x27;t take the tea every day but I do feel like they are good to pair together...please don&#x27;t stop making these supplements! I&#x27;ve seen some pretty expensive stuff on the market and was almost tempted to try other things but I decided to try these because they were more affordable and the reviews seemed really good...don&#x27;t hesitate, try them!</li>
    <li> I love this produt, it made my hair feel thick. I got alot of new growth. I am on my second bottle. My skin is clear and I have a glow to my face</li>
    <li> Great stuff! Seeing improvements already!</li>
    <li> This stuff really works! My hair feels much stronger after using this consistently!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m currently on my second bottle.  I bought the first on sale and came back to pay full price for a second.  When I use it consistently my hair looks thicker and fuller, I also notice less shedding.  My nails are also less brittle and less prone to cracking.  I only take one pill a day, anything more I get painful pimples, but that is to be expected with a lot of supplements.  Super fast shipping as well.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This stuff actually does work! I noticed a difference in my hair and then in my skin especially. The only draw back for me was that the pills themselves are kind of large, and for me hard to swallow.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with my results thus far.  I only gave 4 stars bcz I want to get a true result after, let&#x27;s say, 3 months and it&#x27;s only been a little over a month. I gave not 1 complaint.  I had/have serious breakage in my crown, due to what I blv is a dermatitis of sort, well sel sun blue took care of that but I&#x27;m still dealing with the effects (breakage).  BB not only is giving me healthy hair follicles (bcz that&#x27;s all hair vitamins do) but as my new growth is coming my overall texture is very soft and I&#x27;m not able to reap the benefits of the other products I&#x27;m using bcz my follicles &amp; scalp has a better growing environment.  I also appreciated the well wishes in a hand written note from the company.  Sometimes it&#x27;s the little things</li>
    <li> I can see the difference in my nails.  Not as obvious with my hair and skin.</li>
    <li> absolutely wonderful product. my hair is stronger and nails are longer</li>
    <li> I tried this product hoping it would amp my hair growth back to normal because my hair growth slowed down after a head injury. Although I took the vitamins during my protective styling period, once I took my hair down I was definitely pleased with the amount of growth in 1 month! I would definitely say I am buying this product on a regular basis. Best of all I did not break out from the high dosage of Biotin as I did with Nature&#x27;s Bounty Hair Nails and Skin vitamin. I also read reviews on similar hair vitamins but was deterred by the amount of people reporting breakouts. Very good and I recommend it if you are doing a hair growth challenge.</li>
    <li> I really do like this product. I just placed an order for two more bottles( Free shipping made it a lot easier) Im really excited that I found this product by accident. I would drink Bamboo leaf tea before I got these vitamins as part of the 30 Challenge and sometimes it was too much of a hassle, so to have bamboo leaf extract as a part of this vitamin is extremely convenient! I am going to review these vitamins on youtube soon after i finish my 1 month supply and start the second bottle since these vitamins are extremely new on the market and I want to be completely accurate when doing a video review! This is a really good investment because I have already noticed growth and a difference in my hair health as well as my nails. I havent experienced any breakouts because of these vitamins either which is a plus since I know that some hair vitamins make people break out. will continue to purchase! already have a 3 month supply! Only reason I am giving this product a 4/5 is because Im not too sure of the doasge amounts for the greentea and etc and what the equivalents are .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Is an update and I&#x27;m almost on my third bottle! Love this. Will update with a before and after photo . This is a month after I got a trim and it has grown back plus more !!</li>
    <li> this is my second bottle of these vitamins. I have been taking them for about a month. My finger are growing very quickly and are very strong. They used to be pitifully weak. I am also taking biotin and MSM, so of course it is a little hard to tell what is doing what. But I was taking the other 2 before I started with these, and I can tell they have improved my nails even more. I really like the fact that these double as a complete multivitamin and that they don&#x27;t have iron in them. I plan to continue taking these.</li>
    <li> I have not seen any difference yet, but has only been 3 weeks for me.</li>
    <li> I started taking Beautifully Bamboo vitamins six weeks ago.  My hair is growing at a faster rate. My hair has more of a shine, is much thicker and softer than ever.  My nails have grown a lot also.  This is the best vitamin I have ever taken and I have already ordered another three month supply because I never want to miss a day taking this vitamin.</li>
    <li> I just ordered my second bottle of Bamboo Ultra Vitamins. My hair has grown more than 2 inches, and my nails and skin have improved. I have also noticed that my eyelashes are longer. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Came super fast, easy for me to swallow...will be back in a month for hair update</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had thib hair, but after 5 days of using this product i have noticed a huuuge difference in my hair growth and thickening. My nails are good and strong and my skin is softer then usually. I can honsetly say this is one of the best products i have tried and i am looking foward to my next bottle.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for a week and already notice a big difference in my hair. Shiny, fuller, and less hair falling out. I even notice some hair re-growth.</li>
    <li> Disappointed that soy wasn&#x27;t listed as an ingredient. Also, I took one dose and had really bad acid reflux.</li>
    <li> Great product!  My hair is growing and is a lot stronger.  There is less hair falling out during washing and combing.</li>
    <li> It really works!!! I take this vitamins and drink the bamboo Tea, it has not even been a whole month and I&#x27;m seeing great results. I&#x27;ve already ordered my second bottle. 😃😃😃</li>
    <li> Great products for anyone whose on a hair journey.</li>
    <li> These are so lovely. The had no unpleasant after taste and are easy to swallow. I ordered the tea as well and both arrived quickly with a hand written note! My nails are growing faster and they are thicker than usual. My skin was fine before so I can&#x27;t say it has changed but my hair is growing nicely, the new growth on each individual hair is thicker if that makes sense lol</li>
    <li> No after taste, it doesn&#x27;t bother my stomach... as far as growth, I&#x27;m not sure yet... I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> i liked the 900 mg better but i still finished the bottlle</li>
    <li> I took these with biotin..when I cut my nails they grew back within 2 weeks..my hair does shed less and I think it&#x27;s a little thicker..but I wanted it to grow in length more because my hair I already pretty thick..going to try a different brand for now</li>
    <li> I have not seen any difference at this time, but I will continue to use cause it has so many good ingredients for your hair to grow and be healthy. So I will post and Update in a month.</li>
    <li> I purchased this and received it right away.  I have been using it for about 3weeks and already notice a difference in my nails and my skin.  The texture of my hair is stronger and it looks shinier.  I bought some more and will continue to use it.  Let&#x27;s see what happens in the next 3weeks and what changes take place as far as hair growth. Will leave anothe review with that info. The product is worth trying.</li>
    <li> Was introduced  to this  product  by my daughter.  Loved  it</li>
    <li> I have been taking these vitamins for a month now and noticed increased thickness and some growth. My nails are also growing fast. I just received my second bottle and eager to see more results. Great product!!</li>
