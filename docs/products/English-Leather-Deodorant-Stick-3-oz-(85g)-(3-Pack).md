      <li>Outstanding product.  </li>
      <li>I could stay with the EL, but will find a better solution.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to purchase 3 more sticks</li>
      <li>Otherwise it;s OK</li>
      <li>so I made sure he had some on hand for a while.</li>
      <li>and he said \\&quot;Sure thing\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;he</li>
      <li>and that is what is most important.</li>
      <li>Purchase was easy and as advertised.</li>
      <li>No longer nearly as nice as it used to be - I&#x27;ll be exploring alternatives for the first time in 20 years.</li>
      <li>Works fine as a deodorant but doesn&#x27;t smell like I remember.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m once again a HAPPY English Leather Man.</li>
      <li>This is a great male fragrance.</li>
      <li>was so happy with it, and for that a five star is just not enough.</li>
      <li>We can not find these in our local stores so it was great to find it online.  </li>
      <li>I have used English Leather for many years and loved its fragrance.  </li>
      <li>this works for me but liked old formula better.</li>
      <li>(I originally wrote how they had destroyed a 50+ year old wonderful product by changing the formula completely.  </li>
      <li>like English Leather and am happy to have it back.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived quickly on time.</li>
      <li>My father was so excited when he got these.</li>
      <li>They were not the quality of the original Dana products.</li>
      <li>ORIGINAL FORMULA</li>

      <li>Significant amount of deodorant had evaporated.</li>
      <li>Nothing like the original</li>
      <li>The fragrance has changed significantly from what it once was.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not returning this only because it smells OK (kind of citrusy)</li>
      <li>Fast shipment, as well as, outstanding service.</li>
      <li>cool beans</li>
      <li>Not bad - just not what I remember and that may just be me.</li>
      <li>It is nice to find English Leather Deodorant Sticks still available on the web.</li>
      <li>It is a shame that only the local Sears store seems to stock this excellent product.</li>

      <li>, I have been a loyal customer to Dana&#x27;s EL&#x27;s stick for decades.  </li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t heavy and clogging, it goes on easily without polluting the air, we like the slightly unusual musky scent, and it&#x27;s very effective at its job.</li>
      <li>It smells great, My dad loves it and uses it everyday.</li>
      <li>The 3 sticks I got from this vendor came perfectly fresh.</li>
      <li>This is an old favorite of mine.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> English Leather products have always been one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> We can not find these in our local stores so it was great to find it online.  Purchase was easy and as advertised.</li>
    <li> Exactly what my husband wanted.  Not easy to find in stores anymore except in gift sets for Christmas.  Has such a clean,pleasing fragrance for a man.  Our thanks.</li>
    <li> this is a good deal ... this is also by dana but the product is fresh... I also order the listing by dana to see the difference ... they are made by the same manufacturer, but a different warehouse and shipper. the single tube from by dana shipper was somewhat dehydrated... these were in excellent shape. this is the one to order... less costly and fresher....</li>
    <li> Not the product that I wanted/expected/was offered.  Different container.  Different smell. Yech.  Wonder if this was fraudulent.    Thanks Amazon for expediting my refund.</li>
    <li> English leather is one of the few deodorants I have found that I am not allergic to and it works better for me than any other deodorant I have tired, and I have tried many.  It does not stain clothing like some deodorants do nor do I get a rash with it and it has a very pleasant fragrance.  I have been using this product for over 30 years.  I can no longer find it in local stores so have been ordering it online for the past couple of years.  My online orders have all been delivered in good condition, no problems with deodorant sticks being dried out like I occasionally found in local stores.  I highly recommend this product and hope that the company continues to make it and Amazon continues to offer it.</li>
    <li> This is so hard to find around my area any more.  I was very happy to find this product, and I could afford it!!!</li>
    <li> My dad used to wear this when I was a kid and every time I smell it I think of our sledding trips in Minnesota. He used to put me under his arm and carry me up the steep hill before tying my hands to that old piece of plywood and giving me a push. Ahh, what wonderful memories. Of course, I grew up to be a dolphin trainer, the third best in the world, and I have very little need for deodorant but I still buy this stuff for the wonderful smell. My wife is always telling me I should just wear the deodorant instead of rubbing it on my pillow every night but she is clueless and frankly quite chubby. Now, don&#x27;t get me wrong, this stuff doesn&#x27;t smell like leather but that won&#x27;t stop me from telling people I used to ride horses. If you catch my drift.</li>
    <li> Have been using the English leather deodorant stick for 40 yrs.  It is the only deodorant product, I&#x27;ve found, that does not cause an irritating underarm rash!!!  Don&#x27;t stop making it and hopefully Amazon will continue to carry it on the website.</li>
    <li> The product by Dana was poorly compounded, it does not spread properly.  At the rate it spreads off the stick it will last 20 years.  Mostly one spreads on the arm pit a bit of scent but no or very little perspiration prevention.  All other brands of English Leather deodorant stick I have purchased I have been satisfied with.</li>
    <li> I was surprised to find English Leather available, apparently this product has been picked up by &#x27;Dana&#x27; cosmetics and is back in production.&lt;br /&gt;I like English Leather and am happy to have it back.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived quickly on time.</li>
    <li> I have been using English Leather for as long as I can remember. I really do wish they still sold the deodorant in the store but I am happy they have it on-line still. I did not notice any changes in the formula but then again, my wife says I have a broken nose. I know that she likes it though and that is what is most important. I have been ordering it in the 3 pack for several years now. I comes quickly and I always have a supply of it. One thing... it is rather expensive but worth it.</li>
    <li> English leather Deodorant Stick is the deodorant I have been using for over 45 years and the best product for my body and peace of mind.  It iw no longer available in any store I know of in my local area and the internet was my only opertunity.  One stick last me about 2 months and I bought 3 sticks (thats as many as I can buy at one time or they dry out.)  I received good service from Amazon.com.  Thank You.  RAP</li>
    <li> this works for me but liked old formula better.</li>
    <li> I have not found this item in retail stores for several years. I live in an area where retail stores are a premium. It is nice to find English Leather Deodorant Sticks still available on the web. I have looked for another deodorant that worked for me as well as English Leather but have not found any. If you are looking for a deodorant that eliminates odor and does not smell like perfume or cologne this is for you.  I did not know that this deo came in two flavors. It would be nice to list them in the product description. Even though this was a new scent for me it still works</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really great having this available. English Leather just isn&#x27;t a big-box store kind of thing. I really like this product and have for years. The price was excellent and delivery super fast, too! Great!</li>
    <li> My dad loves this deodorant. I think he will buy it again. Not sure when though at this time. lol.</li>
    <li> This deodorant is not original from Canada, it is from USA, it&#x27;s a replica.  Low quality, I&#x27;m very dissapointed with these deodorant sticks.</li>
    <li> My father was so excited when he got these. He keeps telling me that it is so hard to find these products so i guess i will be buying english leather from amazon for a while.</li>
    <li> Great product my dad has used it for years, and so have I. I can not buy it locally anymore, I&#x27;m just happy I can buy it once again.</li>
    <li> This is my BF&#x27;s favorite.  It is hard to find in the store.  We are both very happy!</li>
    <li> Have used this product for many years.  I purchased six 3 oz sticks with this order.  Product was old and did not have the same scent and color that it normaly should have. There were blobs of a white substance dispursed throughout the product.  Is not fit to use.</li>
    <li> My husband likes English Leather  after shave &amp; I found this deodorant and thought he could give it a try.  He really likes it, and it smells wonderful.  Fast shipping too.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy! Not the same as before. Very poor product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I have used this one for years and it keeps me dry all day and still controls odor as well, just ask my wife!</li>
    <li> Although now made in China, this is the same reciepe, English Leather deodorant stick I&#x27;ve used for over fifty years.</li>
    <li> This is the only deodorant stick I have used for over 30 years.  It has changed.  I&#x27;m not sure why the change but the fragrance is slightly different and lighter.  the stick used to look like it was formed and then put into the dispenser but now it looks as though it was poured into the dispenser.  It used to be tan colored and now it is pink.  Even my wife, who used to insist that I wear it, doesn&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as pleasing in this new form.</li>
    <li> Notice all the highly rated reviews are prior to late 2014.  The new formula is a terrible disappointment and I will never order it again.</li>
    <li> I have bought this product for many years, my newest purchase is a change, doesn&#x27;t work the same and doesn&#x27;t work at all! Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> price is high, found it cheaper</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t around 30 years ago, and I have only used this deodorant for 4 years. I can accept that the fragrance might have changed over the years and that some users are disappointed. However, I see absolutely no difference between this one sold on Amazon and the one I could still get at my local store a year ago. This product has a tendancy to shrink if you leave it on the shelf for too long. I&#x27;ve had the problem in the past. The 3 sticks I got from this vendor came perfectly fresh. Fast delivery. I can only recommend this vendor.</li>
    <li> Third time buying from this company and third time it was a 5 star sell. We all know you can&#x27;t get the old school English leather, but this is as close as you can get.</li>
    <li> All my adult life I have enjoyed the smell of English Leather.  I really like the scent of the deodorant.  It is not easy to find as no store carries it so internet sales fill the bill.  I will use this product until my death.</li>
    <li> UPDATE:  ORIGINAL FORMULA MADE IN THE USA is now back from the Dana Corp !!  (I originally wrote how they had destroyed a 50+ year old wonderful product by changing the formula completely.  But due to widespread complaints they have gone back to the original formula.)  I still leave a 1-star rating here as the price above is absurd.  Go directly to the DANA website and buy this product fresh for $3.99 a stick:  danabeauty dot com</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this deoderant exclusively since 1989 and nothing seems to work so well for so long. I got my fist sick as a gift in a Christmas Stocking and it turned out to be the most effective deoderant I&#x27;ve ever used. I highly recommend giveing it a try.</li>
    <li> Ordered this when my stash finally ran out.  The fragrance has changed significantly from what it once was. The gentle pleasant musk scent is greatly diminished, and is now overwhelmed by an astringent antiseptic smell. Comparing labels, it seems that the deodorant is now made in China, so the quality probably isn&#x27;t nearly as good any more either, though the list of ingredients (despite the erroneous omissions in the English-language labeling) has remained the same.  No longer nearly as nice as it used to be - I&#x27;ll be exploring alternatives for the first time in 20 years.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this. I have use English Leather for 30 years. THIS IS NOT THE SAME PRODUCT. Smell is awful. My wife agrees.</li>
    <li> WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN WERE OLD AND SHRUNK UP FELL APART COULD NOT USE</li>
    <li> my hubby really likes English leather and this is one of the only places he can find it - thank you</li>
    <li> Hard to find in local stores.  Great fragrance.  No aluminum content which has been linked in deodorants to Alzheimer&#x27;s Disease (maybe, but why risk it?)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years with complete satisfaction, however, the batch I recently received had appartently been sitting on a self somewhere for far too long before shipping.  When applied, it is creamy not clear (as it usually is) and the scent lasts only a short while.  Quite simply the product was not fresh.</li>
    <li> Using it for over 14yrs, and I am glad I could now find it on the Internet as none of the store carry it anymore.</li>
    <li> I purchased this from these guys before with no prob but this time they came with no seal all dryed out and unusable :( not a happy shopper</li>
    <li> Nothing like the original</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite and I was having trouble finding it in the small town we live in.&lt;br /&gt;He was very pleased that I was able to order it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 30 years.  What I received was not what I been using all these years.  The scent and color are different and the scent is not pleasing.  Something has changed!!</li>
    <li> Outstanding product.  I have used this deodorant since 1961.  In recent years it is not available in various cities in the United States.  I am most pleased with this seller.  Fast shipment, as well as, outstanding service.</li>
    <li> The stick is still good quality . The improvement has been the foil used to keep the bar from drying out like it used to in the past, Good product.</li>
    <li> After 30+ years of using English Leather, I have been ruined for it forever by the deodorant from Dana Classics. The \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; was disgusting ---very reminiscent of rotten eggs. No Mas !! \\&quot;English Leather\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> All three sticks of the deodorant were dried out.</li>
    <li> I love English Leather products. The price was great and the seller shipping was fast too.</li>
    <li> It is a shame that only the local Sears store seems to stock this excellent product. English Leather has a cool, crisp feeling &amp; unique fragrance that is unmistakable. Thankfully, the product lives on via the Internet in cybermarkets such as Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> I used to be able to purchase this time at Walmart or Walgreens, but they both no longer carry it so I decided to check on Amazon and to my surprise I found it so I purchased a 3pack for Christmas gifts for my dad and nephew, after I used some my Amazon Visa points I got a really great deal definitely will be buying again</li>
    <li> WE HAVE BEEN MARRIED 47 YRS AND HE HAS ALWAYS USED ENGLISH LEATHER IT IS HIS AND MY FAVORITE TOO!</li>
    <li> I have used English Leather for many years and loved its fragrance.  However, the fragrance has been changed and I can no longer get the original scent.  I will never buy English Leather from any dealer ever again.  New it is, improved it is not.</li>
    <li> ATTRACTIVE PRICING AND JUST WHAT I WANTED.</li>
    <li> The deodorant part is too small and the hard plastic container rubs the underarm when trying to apply.</li>
    <li> This is a great male fragrance. &amp;#34;Not available in stores&amp;#34; is usually a red flag, but this is a winner!&lt;br /&gt;Oops, wait a minute. I just opened and used the first canister and it is quite different from the normal English Leather I&#x27;m used to. The canister says &amp;#34;original formula&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s a lot different than the last batch I bought. Even the canister is different. I would go back to Old Spice, but they changed their formulation, and not for the better. Maybe I&#x27;ll write my congressman! Too bad!</li>
    <li> My father has been and English Leather man  since I was a young child he is now 75 years old and still loves&lt;br /&gt;it so I made sure he had some on hand for a while. I called him to see if it was the one he uses and he said \\&quot;Sure thing\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;he was so happy with it, and for that a five star is just not enough. Thank you!!</li>
    <li> This is item is hard to find in the shopping malls.  I was happy that I found it through Amazon.  It&#x27;s a favorite item for my husband.</li>
    <li> As 4 of the 6 deodorants have been opened they are dried up to only 1/4 of its original size.  Completely unable to even use and now our 30 day return frame has expired.  What a waste of money!  Next time I will know to inspect all items delivered.  Will never order from this party again.</li>
    <li> The deodorant sticks sent to me said they were by Dana, but had a different logo , not the English Saddle.  The deodorant evaporated and did not hold up mechanically in its dispenser.  They were not the quality of the original Dana products.</li>
    <li> Product is fine but the unit that contains the small stick is terrible. Either make the stick larger to fit the container or the container smaller to fit the stick. The way it is now the stick will break in use before the stick is used up. I will never buy this product again.</li>
    <li> This is the only deodorant my husband and I are willing to use.  It isn&#x27;t heavy and clogging, it goes on easily without polluting the air, we like the slightly unusual musky scent, and it&#x27;s very effective at its job. Plus no one in our family is allergic to it.  We&#x27;ve used it since we were married in England in 1967, and it can be hard to find.  Thank goodness it can be had through Amazon!</li>
    <li> I ordered the push up stick and received the roll up stick</li>
    <li> This is my husbands favorite brand of deodorant mostly because it does not irritate his skin, unfortunately I can longer find this English Leather product in any of my local stores.</li>
    <li> This is a kind of hard item to find. I was thrilled to be able to get my husband a year&#x27;s supply.</li>
    <li> This is an old favorite of mine.  It is hard to find in stores locally.  Glad it is offered here.  I am a big fan of this product.</li>
    <li> Two of the deodorant sticks were dried out to nothing. I&#x27;ll have to find a more reliable vendor.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for with this hard to find product I used to like, many years ago.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> My husband has used English Leather for years. We cant,&#x27;get it any where we live. That&#x27;s why we get it thru Amonzon .I would tell my friends about English Leather in a minute. I like the smell of it. It last all day and he&#x27;s glad for some of the hard labor he does.Marolyn</li>
    <li> For my husband--he really likes it.</li>
    <li> This item is great. It smells great, My dad loves it and uses it everyday. I recommend this product to everyone</li>
    <li> I have used English Leather products since college years. It is my favorite item.</li>
    <li> something Ii get all the time</li>
    <li> The product was old -  one stick was only about 1/3 full the rest had evaporated or something.  My husband has used nothing else in our 44 years of marriage -  not certain I could stand to have him change scents so it is ok.</li>
    <li> After I drove around to many local stores with no luck, I just let my fingers do the shopping.  No fuss, no muss.</li>
    <li> This the second time I have ordered the 3 pack and each time the sticks are dried up I will not order them again, first time Fragrance net this time otc. they are buying outdated stuff and pushing it off as new</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not returning this only because it smells OK (kind of citrusy) and I&#x27;m out of deodorant.  However, I agree with the other 40-year users, this smells NOTHING like English Leather, nor does it go on the same way--it&#x27;s a very hard, dry stick (and I don&#x27;t mean dried-out-- it seems to be designed this way).  It&#x27;s so utterly different from any English Leather stick that I&#x27;ve ever bought (including many Amazon purchases) that my first reaction was that it must be a counterfeit product.  Very odd.</li>
    <li> I just returned my third shipment of deodorant. Not only did they change the formula (which I was not crazy about, but used anyway) but they are all dehydrated and useless.  I have used English Leather deodorant for many years and am disappointed that I now have to look for another product.  I hope that Dana pays attention to this and fixes their problem before this product goes off the market completely</li>
    <li> Listen, this stuff smells AMAZING. And when you get onto an elevator while wearing it, everyone will agree. No one will doubt your refined, gentlemanly masculinity when you smell like such a sublime mixture of your grandfather, vetiver, and saddle soap. THAT&#x27;S SOCIAL MEDIA.</li>
    <li> Came exactly when promised - as promised.  It was given as part of a Christmas gft.  The boys love it.</li>
    <li> The deodorant works fine, but seemed old and dried out.  Like it&#x27;s been sitting around a warehouse for 20 years, which it probably has. Still, I will buy it again as this problem is merely cosmetic.</li>
    <li> They changed the formula and it is no longer the same product. I purchased and returned it to OTC Warehouse.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a different formula and not alcohol based as were the previous purchases from this dealer. Will not buy again unless they revert to the classic formula.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this brand of deodorant but,  can&#x27;t seem to find it anywhere and we have looked even in other states.  Then,  there it is,  on. AMAZON.  Wonderful.</li>
    <li> Excellent experience and went above an beyond expectations.</li>
    <li> While delivery was prompt, the flaws reside with the product redesign itself. A notable percentage (20%) were useless when the seal apparently failed and the product was dried out, even before use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all the brands available and the various type of deodorants, solid and spray, I have been a loyal customer to Dana&#x27;s EL&#x27;s stick for decades.  As the market changed, I have tried others on both sides as it became almost impossible to find EL in-store in the past few years. Online has been the solution.  Unlike the store purchases, the online often suffered from apparent extended storage, with some seals failing, drying the product out before delivery. However within the last year or so, a redesign of the container has not improved the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original design was basic, but effective and allowed the user to access the product to almost the very last of the stick with a simple push.  Like others, the new design uses a twisting mechanism with a central screw. After extended use this new design creates two problems - There is less of a seal at the base, so the product can dry out, and even with care, the screw can drill up through the product instead of just pushing. As an end result, you can lose about 30% of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish I could stay with the EL, but will find a better solution.  If it ain&#x27;t broken, don&#x27;t fix it.</li>
    <li> its very good product. nothing change. very good. i love it. no marks on your clothing. i wish something like that for ladies. still it also very sporty smell</li>
    <li> Great product.&lt;br /&gt;Been using this product for years. For some reason can&#x27;t find it in stores. Like English Leather much better than the other stuff on the market.</li>
    <li> This was not the specific offering of the deororant I was looking for but it works.</li>
    <li> My husband, who has been using this deodorant for many years, said that it seemed like the same as he has always used.</li>
    <li> I received three of the deodorant sticks and all three are about 75% dried up.  The sticks have shrunk down tremendously.</li>
    <li> My dad has been a fan of English Leather ever since I was a little girl but it&#x27;s been difficult to find.  I was so happy to find it available on Amazon, I got my dad stocked up.</li>
    <li> Love this product.&lt;br /&gt;Wish it were available in local drug stores.  Haven&#x27;t been able to get it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> Great.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years.  Can only get it on line.</li>
    <li> It works well but it is not the odour i was looking for.  I am trying to find the odour of my old English Leather stick which has depleted.</li>
    <li> The 3 sticks were starting to dry up or had dried up so it was unusable. I ordered once before and the sticks were ok and had seals on them over the top and the bottoms were tight. The quality has deteriorated, and I don&#x27;t think I will be purchasing this product any more.</li>
    <li> arrived in tact and as expected</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered, thank you, a favourite product of my husband&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Significant amount of deodorant had evaporated. What remained rattled loosely inside plastic container. Stock obviously was very old. Should not have been shipped.</li>
    <li> I ordered it for my Dad because he hasn&#x27;t been able to find it in stores and he was very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Not English Leather!!! It has been a big disappointment!! You need to try again!!</li>
    <li> Not made to the original English Leather scent... Otherwise it;s OK</li>
    <li> I had used this stick for over 25 years and was just chushed when I could no longer purchase it in area stores. I was told the company went out of business. What a supprise when I found it on the Internet. I wasn&#x27;t sure it was the same English Leather I used for so many years. I purchased 3 sticks and YES I can say it&#x27;s the same stick that I used for so many year. I pray it stays on the market. I&#x27;m going to purchase 3 more sticks just so I have an inventory on hand. I&#x27;m once again a HAPPY English Leather Man. And my wife once again likes the way I smell.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with service and product was exactly as expected.  This was a repeat purchase.  Have not had the problem with strange odor on the last two orders.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> It is a deaderant that I have used for many years and have never been disappointed with it use at anytime</li>
    <li> English leather is generally a good choice compared with other overpriced products. I buy it regularly. However, the last shipment contained one stick that was only filled to 2/3.</li>
    <li> My CMS Hubby was so glad to receive this - He couldn&#x27;t find it in local department stores. THANKS!</li>
    <li> Product is just like that I used to purchase when it was in stores.  These folks sure take their time shipping it though.  Took a week and a half to get this one item while stuff in the same order from other suppliers in the same Amazon order took just a few days.  I would buy the product again, but will make sure I don&#x27;t get it from this slowpoke supplier next time.  Amazon needs to find a better supplier.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for as long as it has been on the market. But in the past several years i can&#x27;t  find it in the stores.&lt;br /&gt;The price is unbelievablely low.&lt;br /&gt;Buying  in a 3 pk has a little drawback because of the heat here in AZ...So I keep 2 in the refer.&lt;br /&gt;I still like their slogan the lady says &amp;#34;If my men don&#x27;t wear English Leather they wear nothing at all&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;After shave is great also.&lt;br /&gt;Ben M.</li>
    <li> Great deodorant and hard to find in stores.</li>
    <li> My dad LOVES this stuff!</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite.  Very hard to find</li>
    <li> Not the original ENglish Leather. This one was made by Dana. Not original scent.  Different from whats on picture. Arrived wrapped in scotch tape. After unwrapping leaves sticky resude all over it. Cheap immitation, not worth the money. Returning</li>
    <li> Works fine as a deodorant but doesn&#x27;t smell like I remember.  Not bad - just not what I remember and that may just be me.</li>
    <li> Product works as described with no issues.</li>
    <li> does not seem to be the original English Leather</li>
    <li> Product had deteriorated (soft/mushey) and is very difficult to apply. I am greatly dissapointed!</li>
    <li> English Leather changed their formula - it used to smell and feel much cleaner and better.</li>
    <li> I love English Leather and have used it since I was a teen.  (now 69)  However... the scent has changed over the past several years and this particular order was in a slightly different package which allowed air into the &amp;#34;chamber&amp;#34; and the &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; shrunk (diameter) considerably even before I started to use it.  So, I shall be looking for another deodorant.  I haven&#x27;t found anything else I like as much - so far.</li>
    <li> Dry, bad storage may be?</li>
    <li> I was surprised at the increase in price and the reduction in container quality.</li>
    <li> This was not the old style product/packaging as pictured in the ad when I ordered it.</li>
    <li> My adult sons have used only this type deodorant for years.</li>
    <li> I received what I ordered, in a timely manner and at the price I was quoated. I am very happy!</li>
    <li> Like this deodorant smells like old english I wore back in the eighties....bring back memories of high school days...cool beans</li>
    <li> The supplier was wonderful..the product has changed..and I am NOT very happy with it.</li>
