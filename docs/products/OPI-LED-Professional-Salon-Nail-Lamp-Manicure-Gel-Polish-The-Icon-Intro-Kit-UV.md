    <li> Professional, as it claims, well-made, great value.  Seller kept us informed of its progress arriving, and did not let UPS leave it on the doorstep to be stolen during the Christmas delivery season.  VERY PLEASED WITH THIS ITEM and with the seller&#x27;s service!</li>
    <li> Amazing worth the 500 must buy</li>
    <li> This kit has everything you need to do a professional gel manicure at home.  It is fully comprehensive and the variety of colors are enough to get you started. I&#x27;ve used a lot of different gel nail products (CND Shellac, Harmony Gelish, SuperNail ProGel) over the years and the products from OPI are the easiest to apply and cure.  By far, this was the fastest gel color application that I have done on my own.  It is very easy to apply thin coats of the polish and the bonder keeps the polish in place for two weeks as promised. This is an investment, but when compared to what you pay in salon visits each year (and the time spent in them)...this set will pay for itself in no time. Great seller too - kit arrived in new condition within a few business days. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> It has everything you need exept the cleanser. But it&#x27;s perfect for beginners:) love the product! I really recommend this.</li>
    <li> This is the real salon package</li>
    <li> ....unlike some &amp;#34;kits&amp;#34; I returned.  I&#x27;m absolutely thrilled with this product.  Took a little too long to ship but once I got I&#x27;ve been using it like a new toy at Christmas.  It lasts like it saids it does and love that you offer so many colors for a first kit.  After all you spend the money, you expect to get all you need for a while.  Would like more variety in more color kits to buy and maybe some pointers on how to apply gems well.</li>
    <li> It came faster than I expected. Love the colors in the kit. I really like the led touch lamp! Really keeps my nails chip free for 2 weeks!!</li>
    <li> Love it. Works great. No issues to report</li>
    <li> I love this set!  I had read so many articles and medical journals talking about the health pitfalls of going to nail salons but I loved the gel look.  This was the perfect at home solution for me.  After I complete the process on my nails it lasts about 2 weeks and looks great.  I am very happy I decided to make this purchase.</li>
    <li> I love my new Opi nail kit . It has everything needed to start doing Gel nails that look in a professional manner... All was as described and works wonderfully !!&lt;br /&gt;  Thank you from a very satisfied customer !!</li>
    <li> Great!  worked as advertised and paid for itself in no time</li>
    <li> Love this lamp. The kit was perfect for a starter kit. The colors are beautiful too.</li>
    <li> Arrived after some initial problems with shipping.  Great products and loving being able to do my own nails!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this. I have been using OPI nail polish for years as the quality and affordability is beyond compare. Now I am into the gel polish but did not want to pay $33 every couple weeks at a salon so I purchased this kit ( my favorite  nail color included and a deciding factor ) to do them myself at home.  I like the 4 time settings, the bigger size of this lamp, as I have long fingers and it is deep enough I do not worry about bumping the tips on the back wall. OPI has a big selection of gel polish available to buy..... my nails look great and can be done on my schedule no appointment needed. I can also touch up one if need be.... so many positives, too may to mention.  : D</li>
    <li> Great Set.  Includes everything you need to do your whole set.  Very easy to use.  Great buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: still going strong.  I have been doing my nails regularly with the machine and I have yet to find something I dislike.  Stop having to wait around for a free chair and buy your own Opi set.  You can do yourself your own and it is not difficult at all just follow the steps.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife for her birthday. She loves it! She has always wanted a full kit to do her nails. Happy wife happy life</li>
    <li> Best investment!! I&#x27;ve had  it a little over a year and still use it constantly!!!</li>
    <li> Came with everything it said it would. The only thing I was disappointed abut was the remover, it takes a very long time to remove the polish and I found a lot of scraping was required.</li>
    <li> I am in love!!  This is exactly what I was looking for.  Easy to use, great instructions and worked perfectly.  Now I can have a great looking manicure in my own home!!!</li>
    <li> The products are fantastic and work great.  I absolutely love the lamp and all the colors are gorgeous.  The polish stays on a lot longer than regular polish.  The product took a long time ship (almost three weeks) which was not what was listed in the shipping description. After the seller was contacted it took a few more days before it shipped.  The box came tore up and was missing one item, but after contacting the seller again, they sent it.</li>
    <li> Love having beautifully manicured hands at my own dispense 👑💁</li>
