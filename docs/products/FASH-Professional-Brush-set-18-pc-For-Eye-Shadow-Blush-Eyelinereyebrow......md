      <li>The two brushes I really really love are the blush brush and the concealer brush, super easy to use and really easy to clean.</li>
      <li>None of the brushes shed and they&#x27;re easy to clean</li>
      <li>as for the brushes, they are soft, but before using them I&#x27;d recommend to clean them with warm water and shampoo.</li>
      <li>shes likes the brushes and they seemed to be pretty good quality great for a teen just starting out</li>

      <li>The brushes are cheaply made but some of them are useful.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re perfect brushes for any one just starting out or for a veteran makeup guru.</li>
      <li>I would very much buy again!</li>

      <li>And the case is gorgeous, sturdy, and timeless for a girl who loves pink and plaid.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
      <li>Love these brushes,i wash them with some baby soap and warm water[the water run clear love that] air dry them,they are so soft.</li>
      <li>After searching for the right brush set, I came across this one and decided to try.</li>
      <li>The brushes themselves are so soft and so fine</li>
      <li>They work pretty well</li>
      <li>But the smaller eye brushes are ok.</li>
      <li>the bag had this synthetic smell at first</li>
      <li>but later it got much better.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have super high expectations when I bought this</li>
      <li>Super soft and picks product up fer</li>
      <li>I really liked this brush set although the bristles are a little tougher.</li>
      <li>The spooley was very flimsy.</li>
      <li>These shipped fast.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>it all feels very durable.</li>
      <li>she loved them and despite some the negative reviews i read about the brushes, they have held up well since she began using them.</li>
      <li>will be looking to purchase some of my own in a different color in the future.</li>
      <li>After the first few came loose then more and more started to fall out.  </li>
      <li>I was so excited when they arrived in mail that I tore open the package just to see if they were all that and cookies too.</li>
      <li>i really didn&#x27;t like those brushes , so soft and does not pick up any make up !!</li>
      <li>The angled powder brush was the first to start completely fall apart.</li>
      <li>These came clean with out much effort and dried nice and fluffy with out loosing there shape.</li>
      <li>There are still a few brushes I will not personally use, but for a starter set, were overall great.</li>
      <li>I definitely think this is worth the price for the amount of brushes you are getting.</li>
      <li>I have barely used 2 of the brushes in the whole set!</li>
      <li>I know my poor husband was gracious enough to allow me to put make up on him just so I could try out all of these great brushes.</li>
      <li>These brushes did have a bit of a smell to them when I first opened the packaging, but I just let them sit unwrapped over night and washed them the next day (as you should do with anything new that you&#x27;re using on your face) and the smell was gone.</li>
      <li>Bit rough if using with expensive soft products, but I use it with medium products which is excellent.</li>
      <li>The brushes are really cute, but are hard to use because they are so soft.</li>
      <li>The blush, contour and face brushes are really soft.</li>
      <li>I have been using these brushes daily for over a month now and they are still in like new condition.</li>
      <li>I know that some of my past brushes either wouldn&#x27;t come clean or fell apart when ever I cleaned them.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s a great variety of sizes to choose from, which makes it easy when layering shadows and creating that dramatic smokey eye or just a subtle everyday eye look.</li>
      <li>i like this product alot as well as other people who I showed it too, and the shipping was fast, the packaging came in a box with bubble wrap.</li>
      <li>Which can be good and bad, the largest face brush is a bit too soft and long for me</li>

    <li> I didn&#x27;t have super high expectations when I bought this so I can&#x27;t say I am disappointed. The brushes are cheaply made but some of them are useful.</li>
    <li> I loved these brushes so much I ordered another set for my daughter to keep  her from stealing mine.  One complaint, I wish they came with directions on which brush to use.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great! Not only are the super cute, but they are also great brushes! I was so excited when they arrived in mail that I tore open the package just to see if they were all that and cookies too. I know my poor husband was gracious enough to allow me to put make up on him just so I could try out all of these great brushes. They are honestly some of the best brushes that I have ever owned.

These came clean with out much effort and dried nice and fluffy with out loosing there shape. If you are wondering if these are a good value the answer is YES! I plan to buy from this company again! Keep up all of the good work FASH!</li>
    <li> I was not very happy with these brushes.  After only a few days of use, the brissiles started to come loose.  After the first few came loose then more and more started to fall out.  I would not recommend buying these brushes if you are looking for quality.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my close friend&#x27;s birthday present, so I inspected them somewhat when they arrived. The brushes themselves are so soft and so fine, I wanted to use them on myself! Where the handles are attached to the brushes, [I don&#x27;t know the name of the part] it all feels very durable. No wobbling at all. And the case is gorgeous, sturdy, and timeless for a girl who loves pink and plaid. :]  This is an amazing value for this product! I am pleased, as is the Birthday Girl. Thank you!</li>
    <li> They were pretty good quality, but almost reminiscent of paint brushes... But over all for beginners who don&#x27;t really blend they are good.</li>
    <li> Great quality brushes with very soft bristles in a very cute, perfect size case.  The brushes included in the set meet all of my needs for applying my make up.  Love it so much I ordered another one for my mom as a gift.  Couldn&#x27;t ask for more in a make up brush set!</li>
    <li> I really liked this brush set although the bristles are a little tougher. The two brushes I really really love are the blush brush and the concealer brush, super easy to use and really easy to clean. I definitely think this is worth the price for the amount of brushes you are getting.</li>
    <li> Seller said the item had a black velvet interior lining, which it does not. Velvet lining is one of the reasons I purchases it. Very disappointed. Overall quality is very good.</li>
    <li> When I gifted this FASH product to my wife, I could see the satisfaction in her glowing eyes. Thank God! this is the first time, I selected a product which made her happy. Thanks</li>
    <li> I love the brushes and the case! They are all sturdy good quality and do not shed very much. I have been using these brushes daily for over a month now and they are still in like new condition. I would very much buy again!</li>

    <li> These shipped fast. They&#x27;re perfect brushes for any one just starting out or for a veteran makeup guru. I do make up a lot on myself and friends and this set is great. I love the eyeshadow brushes! There&#x27;s a great variety of sizes to choose from, which makes it easy when layering shadows and creating that dramatic smokey eye or just a subtle everyday eye look. The blush, contour and face brushes are really soft. Which can be good and bad, the largest face brush is a bit too soft and long for me but I still use it for bronzing, which it&#x27;s perfect for because it acts almost as a light duster. The case is so practical too. These brushes did have a bit of a smell to them when I first opened the packaging, but I just let them sit unwrapped over night and washed them the next day (as you should do with anything new that you&#x27;re using on your face) and the smell was gone. It&#x27;s not that terrible of a smell either, it&#x27;s just a stronger \\&quot;new scent\\&quot; smell.</li>
    <li> Bought these makeup brushes for my sister on her birthday with a makeup case and a bunch of makeup shes likes the brushes and they seemed to be pretty good quality great for a teen just starting out</li>
    <li> These brushes are very good for the price! the case is not to smelly compared to other sets I have purchased. The brushes arrived in about 4 days from the time I ordered them</li>
    <li> i really didn&#x27;t like those brushes , so soft and does not pick up any make up !! i just waist my money and i&#x27;m not happy</li>
    <li> The brushes are really cute, but are hard to use because they are so soft. I have barely used 2 of the brushes in the whole set! Not the best purchase I made</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with the set for the most part with the exception of the larger blush brushes. They are too loose to use. But the smaller eye brushes are ok. All in all I don&#x27;t think I would buy it again but I am still using the set I have.</li>
    <li> I bought these as avgift so im not to sure about the quality. But the case they come in is really nice. I like the look of the brushes as well.</li>
    <li> All my customers are in love with this product. Very impressive FASH, the brushes are soft and nice. i like this product alot as well as other people who I showed it too, and the shipping was fast, the packaging came in a box with bubble wrap. Nothing was damaged. Very good</li>
    <li> They have a chemical smell I can&#x27;t get rid of</li>
    <li> They work pretty well but they&#x27;re not as dense as they should be. None of the brushes shed and they&#x27;re easy to clean</li>
    <li> Love these brushes,i wash them with some baby soap and warm water[the water run clear love that] air dry them,they are so soft.</li>
    <li> Excellent color. Would like to be a little shorter, if using with other cases...does not fit in some cases. Bit rough if using with expensive soft products, but I use it with medium products which is excellent. Would like to have the brush names writing on them, but not a big deal. (If you are not starting)</li>
    <li> purchased as a gift for my niece.....she loved them and despite some the negative reviews i read about the brushes, they have held up well since she began using them. will be looking to purchase some of my own in a different color in the future.</li>
    <li> They were great when I first got them. The angled powder brush was the first to start completely fall apart. The spooley was very flimsy. Some of the brushes hairs were very crooked, and I had to manually trim them. There are still a few brushes I will not personally use, but for a starter set, were overall great.</li>
    <li> I love this set. Super soft and picks product up fer well. I didn&#x27;t like that the brushes didn&#x27;t have labels on them saying what brush is what. Other then that awesome set and very cute to.</li>
