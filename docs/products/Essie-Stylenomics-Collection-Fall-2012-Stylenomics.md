      <li>It was just what I was looking for and is perfect for me.</li>
      <li>Essie makes some wonderful nail colors and this one was the perfect color I was looking for.</li>

      <li>the color is great</li>
      <li>When I saw Stylenomics I was so happy.</li>
      <li>Essie is my favorite nail polish!!</li>
      <li>which is amazing because i think it lasted on my nails for a month without chipping!</li>
      <li>This came across as a bright evergreen on my computer.  </li>
      <li>Definitely a good purchase.</li>
      <li>They are both good fall/winter color.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>I was worried about how it would be packaged and if it would get to my home safe, but it was packaged beautifully and there was no damage to the product.</li>
      <li>it runs very smoothly and is about four dollars cheaper than in stores !</li>
      <li>I love Essie and this a great color.</li>
      <li>i love buying it online because i can always get a better deal!!</li>
      <li>Love it!  </li>
      <li>I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS COLOR!</li>
      <li>If its so hazardous how come they could send it to ME??</li>
      <li>Wine and burgundy is huge this year&#x27;s fall, so I&#x27;m very glad that I now own a wine polish.</li>
      <li>I still love the color.</li>
      <li>When I got it, it&#x27;s more of a muddy green/gray.  </li>
      <li>The prices on Amazon are so much better than the drugstores</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I like the color better in the bottle than on the nail.</li>
      <li>LOVE</li>
      <li>Stylish, but not intimidating.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I got...</li>
      <li>and i wore it without a top coat for about a week before i started to get chips.</li>
      <li>I guess the formula just matched really well with seche vite, or something amazing happended for this result to come out.</li>
      <li>and I only gave it three stars because Essie is (usually) a great brand.</li>
      <li>The perfect fall green!</li>
      <li>I was really excited to get this color.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t read the the reviews (overly excited, I guess).  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Because stylenomics is much too darker than I want it to be, I like recessionista better.</li>
      <li>I dont use it much but its a cute color</li>
      <li>Color is true to the picture.</li>
      <li>Still, the polish goes on well and dries fairly quickly.</li>
      <li>However, the one test coat I did use went on so smooth, exactly what you&#x27;d expect from Essie.  </li>
      <li>Its darker on than it looks in the bottle, but you can still see the beautiful teal green in it too.</li>
      <li>Essie is great nail polish though and lasts a few days before it starts to chip.</li>
      <li>It looks as though the color has been lightened up in order to show the \\&quot;essie\\&quot; on the bottle more clearly.</li>
      <li>Essie is worth the money, it goes on so smooth and whether its light,dark or glitter, its always very generous with the bling glitters and shades of all colors.</li>
      <li>I have so many of Essie&#x27;s lighter fun shades and now getting into the really dramatic darks and metallics is great.</li>
      <li>But these two color lasted about three days without chipping, which is REALLY AMAZING, and a whole week without major chipping.</li>
      <li>It has the right amount of boldness to the color to go with anything.  </li>
      <li>and it comes right to my door.</li>
      <li>I do love the color, and it is smooth and easy to apply, but note that it is a very dark hue.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Pretty much your standard awesome essie quality - long lasting, average chip resistance, great finish,.</li>
      <li>First thing to know...</li>
      <li>THIS IS SOOOOO HIGHLY RECOMMENDED AND BUY IT NOW !!</li>
      <li>Actually, I was fell in love with the color that I saw online.  </li>
      <li>But I had looked online for people who had used this color and posted pictures of it, so I knew exactly what to expect.</li>
      <li>It goes on easy &amp; no need to apply 2nd coat.</li>
      <li>This is a great color, not muted, very dark with a bold dark gorgeous green , it goes with a lot of my favorites fall &amp; winter wardrobe colors</li>
      <li>For years I&#x27;ve wanted a nice, dark, kind of a hunter green but darker, nail polish.</li>
      <li>I was very dissappointed.</li>
      <li>I really had my heart set on the color in the picture.  </li>
      <li>It turns to dark green only under sunlight or very bright light.</li>
      <li>I got the nail polish back within three days which is really exciting!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s actually black most of the time.</li>
      <li>Looks a little darker in person (but most Essie colors seem too)</li>
      <li>it is really dark and looks almost black but in the sun you can see the greenish tint, i love it!!</li>
      <li>in the right light (which I&#x27;ve found once in the past 5 days)</li>
      <li>Definitely not the nice emerald green like the picture.  </li>
      <li>the color reads as slightly green, but mostly it&#x27;s just black, with maybe a hint of blue (kind of like Bubbles and Baubles from last season).</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s still a nice dark green, It only took one coat to get the full color</li>
      <li>This is such a great dark green color.</li>
      <li>Since I already have a black nailpolish, I love that this adds just a bit of a different touch.</li>
      <li>WOW.</li>
      <li>I was hoping for more of a deep emerald/forest green.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a more obvious green.  </li>
      <li>Whats worse is that the company Beauty Shine wouldnt allow me to return it because Amazon doesnt accept hazardous products.</li>
      <li>The color appears black at first glance, but you can see the green hues when looking at it more closely.</li>
      <li>so I couldn&#x27;t strip my nails) and it was pretty much one of the darkest black nail polishes I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
      <li>It pretty much looks like you&#x27;re wearing black polish.  </li>
      <li>Super dark.</li>
      <li>Almost like a black with a green shine in the right light.</li>
      <li>I am not the biggest fan of black polish, so those that like the darker look may be more partial to this color.</li>
      <li>It is pretty much black, with a very, VERY slight dark green hint to it, and only in bright light.</li>
      <li>and I thought it looked pretty dark, but if you hold the bottle under the light correctly it has a green tint to it</li>
      <li>, I was pretty surprised for how long they can last without any chipping with Seche Vite.</li>
      <li>It ended up being much darker than I expected.</li>
      <li>Super dark but not so much that you can&#x27;t even tell that it&#x27;s green..</li>
      <li>The color on the bottle and on my nails looks much darker than the picture on the screen, everyone thought my nails were painted black.</li>
      <li>It was a much darker, greenish black after application.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good that it&#x27;s so versatile, but I actually was disappointed because I want to see more green than black.</li>
      <li>I love Essie nail polish and usually the colors are on spot, but this particular color appears to be a dark green</li>

<li> I had enough polish on wand to cover 3 of my little toes b4 needing to dip again.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little too purple than I would like, but there&#x27;s plenty of red in it.</li>
<li> Some people said there is a pink undertone, but I disagree.</li>
<li> If you are looking for a color that is an obvious dark green, however, this is not the shade for you.</li>
<li> Second, when the color is applied, do not expect simply a dark green.</li>
<li> If you are buying this polish because you think it is a deep, dark green, don&#x27;t.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The perfect fall green! Super dark but not so much that you can&#x27;t even tell that it&#x27;s green.. And the formula&#x27;s awesome!!</li>
    <li> I was really excited to get this color.  However, the color is so dark it looks black...with one coat.  I was looking for a more obvious green.  Actually, I was fell in love with the color that I saw online.  I didn&#x27;t read the the reviews (overly excited, I guess).  If I had, I would have realized that the color that is shown online isn&#x27;t the same color you receive.  I&#x27;m going to try to return it.  I really had my heart set on the color in the picture.  However, the one test coat I did use went on so smooth, exactly what you&#x27;d expect from Essie.  Sigh, I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love Essie and this a great color.</li>
    <li> This is a great color for the Fall season. Love it!  The color is so dark it&#x27;s really hard to see any trace if green in it.  It pretty much looks like you&#x27;re wearing black polish.  I still love the color.</li>
    <li> Essie is my favorite nail polish!! i love buying it online because i can always get a better deal!! the color is great it is really dark and looks almost black but in the sun you can see the greenish tint, i love it!!</li>
    <li> I got the nail polish back within three days which is really exciting! I was worried about how it would be packaged and if it would get to my home safe, but it was packaged beautifully and there was no damage to the product. Good purchase!</li>
    <li> This is such a great dark green color. It goes on easy &amp; no need to apply 2nd coat. I had enough polish on wand to cover 3 of my little toes b4 needing to dip again.</li>
    <li> Looks a little darker in person (but most Essie colors seem too) but it&#x27;s still a nice dark green, It only took one coat to get the full color and i wore it without a top coat for about a week before i started to get chips. Definitely a good purchase.</li>
    <li> check the color on google pic before you buy. It looks really different from the picture shown here. I do love the color, and it is smooth and easy to apply, but note that it is a very dark hue.</li>
    <li> I love Essie nail polish and usually the colors are on spot, but this particular color appears to be a dark green but when I painted my nails it came out almost black! I did wait for the polish to dry before judging it, and with disappointment it&#x27;s still either a VERY dark gray/black color. I was hoping that maybe the computer made it a weird color but even in the bottle it looks dark gray/black and I only gave it three stars because Essie is (usually) a great brand.</li>
    <li> I like the formula and everything, but this color is basically black. Very little actual green shows up. Gonna put it under glitter.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely obsessed with this green from Essie!  It is a casually chic jewel-tone green.  Stylish, but not intimidating.  It has the right amount of boldness to the color to go with anything.  LOVE IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty much your standard awesome essie quality - long lasting, average chip resistance, great finish,. Color is true to the picture.</li>
    <li> I dont use it much but its a cute color</li>
    <li> It ended up being much darker than I expected.</li>
    <li> Super dark. Hardly looks green, more black.</li>
    <li> I like the color better in the bottle than on the nail. It comes out REALLY dark - essentially black. I am not the biggest fan of black polish, so those that like the darker look may be more partial to this color. I was hoping for more of a deep emerald/forest green.</li>
    <li> I bought two colors, stylenomics and recessionista.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;STYLENOMICS is a very, very dark green. It&#x27;s actually black most of the time. It turns to dark green only under sunlight or very bright light. I would say it&#x27;s a black with a tone of green than a green with black. The bottle might look green, but once you put on two coats of it, it seems darker than the bottle. It&#x27;s good that it&#x27;s so versatile, but I actually was disappointed because I want to see more green than black. However, I like black anyways so it&#x27;s not a huge problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RECESSIONISTA is a perfect wine. I don&#x27;t know how else to describe it! It&#x27;s WINE WINE WINE. Wine and burgundy is huge this year&#x27;s fall, so I&#x27;m very glad that I now own a wine polish. It&#x27;s a little too purple than I would like, but there&#x27;s plenty of red in it. Some people said there is a pink undertone, but I disagree. It&#x27;s just a purple with red undertone. If you are looking for bloody red, dark red, vampy red, or anything like that, recessionista is not for you although it&#x27;s a great color. I&#x27;m planning on buying another red polish because recessionista is not red enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because stylenomics is much too darker than I want it to be, I like recessionista better. They are both good fall/winter color.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I was pretty surprised for how long they can last without any chipping with Seche Vite. Seche Vite topcoat tends to peel of after one or two days, taking the color with it, with almost all polishes that I&#x27;ve ever tried. But these two color lasted about three days without chipping, which is REALLY AMAZING, and a whole week without major chipping. I had stylenomics on for nine days! I guess the formula just matched really well with seche vite, or something amazing happended for this result to come out. WOW.</li>
    <li> If you are buying this polish because you think it is a deep, dark green, don&#x27;t.  It was a much darker, greenish black after application. I was disappointed because I have enough black nail polish, so I would not have bought it if I thought that was going to be the end result.  That&#x27;s what I get for an impulse buy!</li>
    <li> This review is for Stylenomics (the dark green and the collection&#x27;s namesake). First thing to know... the color displayed on the monitor is not completely true. It looks as though the color has been lightened up in order to show the \\&quot;essie\\&quot; on the bottle more clearly. When you have the bottle in hand, you will see it is darker. Second, when the color is applied, do not expect simply a dark green. It is nearly black. But I had looked online for people who had used this color and posted pictures of it, so I knew exactly what to expect. The color appears black at first glance, but you can see the green hues when looking at it more closely. Since I already have a black nailpolish, I love that this adds just a bit of a different touch. It was just what I was looking for and is perfect for me. If you are looking for a color that is an obvious dark green, however, this is not the shade for you.</li>
    <li> This is a great color, not muted, very dark with a bold dark gorgeous green , it goes with a lot of my favorites fall &amp; winter wardrobe colors and it&#x27;s definitely a shade I&#x27;m glad I got...I have so many of Essie&#x27;s lighter fun shades and now getting into the really dramatic darks and metallics is great. Essie is worth the money, it goes on so smooth and whether its light,dark or glitter, its always very generous with the bling glitters and shades of all colors. 10 stars!</li>
    <li> Definitely darker than I expected. Almost like a black with a green shine in the right light. Essie is great nail polish though and lasts a few days before it starts to chip.</li>
    <li> Love it. Essie makes some wonderful nail colors and this one was the perfect color I was looking for. The prices on Amazon are so much better than the drugstores and it comes right to my door.❤️😃</li>
    <li> When I painted my nails I was very dissappointed. The color on the bottle and on my nails looks much darker than the picture on the screen, everyone thought my nails were painted black. Whats worse is that the company Beauty Shine wouldnt allow me to return it because Amazon doesnt accept hazardous products. If its so hazardous how come they could send it to ME??</li>
    <li> I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS COLOR! it runs very smoothly and is about four dollars cheaper than in stores ! IT STAYS ON MY NAILS FOR SO LONG AND NEVER EVER CHIPS OFF ! which is amazing because i think it lasted on my nails for a month without chipping! THIS IS SOOOOO HIGHLY RECOMMENDED AND BUY IT NOW !!</li>
    <li> For years I&#x27;ve wanted a nice, dark, kind of a hunter green but darker, nail polish. When I saw Stylenomics I was so happy. Then it arrived and I thought it looked pretty dark, but if you hold the bottle under the light correctly it has a green tint to it (NOTHING like the almost jade color that reads (at least on my monitor) in the pictures here). I put a little on a piece of paper (I was at work so I couldn&#x27;t strip my nails) and it was pretty much one of the darkest black nail polishes I&#x27;ve seen. But I gave the polish the benefit of the doubt. Last weekend I painted my nails and it&#x27;s just black. Maybe (MAYBE!) in the right light (which I&#x27;ve found once in the past 5 days) the color reads as slightly green, but mostly it&#x27;s just black, with maybe a hint of blue (kind of like Bubbles and Baubles from last season). My hunt for a dark green nail polish will continue and if I&#x27;m ever in the mood for a \\&quot;green\\&quot; nail polish that looks black and annoys me I&#x27;ll use Stylenomics again.</li>
    <li> I got this hoping for a color similar to the picture, but it is definitely not. It is pretty much black, with a very, VERY slight dark green hint to it, and only in bright light. Still, the polish goes on well and dries fairly quickly.</li>
    <li> Definitely not the nice emerald green like the picture.  Comes out almost completely black.  I am very disappointed with this item.  I was not looking for black polish at this time.</li>
    <li> Its darker on than it looks in the bottle, but you can still see the beautiful teal green in it too. I&#x27;d say it is the perfect color for fall and winter. I have gotten a lot of compliments while wearing it and its always a choice when I go to re color my nails. I wish it were a bit lighter teal however.</li>
    <li> This came across as a bright evergreen on my computer.  When I got it, it&#x27;s more of a muddy green/gray.  I don&#x27;t like this at all.</li>
