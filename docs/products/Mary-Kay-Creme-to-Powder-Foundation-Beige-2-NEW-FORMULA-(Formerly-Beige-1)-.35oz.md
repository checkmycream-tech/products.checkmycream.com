    <li> Mary kay products are great.  My skin feels and stays smooth and clear.  If I try to use something different I usually end up with breakouts and patches of dry skin.  The product from this seller arrived within just a few days, much quicker than I expected and it was in perfect condition  and it was exactly what I ordered!  I will order from htis seller again.</li>
    <li> Return customer of this great product.</li>
    <li> I have used Mary Kay crème to powder for over 20 years. I just love it. I would recommend this for anyone.</li>
    <li> This product and color are what I always use.</li>
    <li> just a little darker  but great</li>
    <li> I have used Mary Kay cosmetics for over 20 years now. I was a consultant for quite a while. I LOVE IT. It does not clog your pours. I have slept in it, worked in it. I get MAYBE ONE zit per year which is usually stress related! The ONLY reason I did NOT give this 5 stars is because $5 for shipping is RIDICULOUS!!!!</li>
    <li> Provides a matte coverage. Long lasting.  I apply with a Shiseido Perfect Foundation Brush for even coverage. Purchased in Beige 1. Recommend!</li>
    <li> Lighter than Beige 2 should be…it actually did say Beige 1 on it.</li>
    <li> it is to cheep of a product to work this great! it cover perfectly, and was shipped very fast! I would highly recommend trying this product</li>
    <li> As expected...it&#x27;s really the only make up that works for me</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and this product works very well for me and cost less than other brands :) ..</li>
    <li> Happy with the purchase!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used MK&#x27;s Crème to Powder for several years, and although I&#x27;ll occasionally TRY another product, I keep coming back to it.  I&#x27;m lucky to have good skin, but I do have rosacea.  Nothing covers the redness like this product.  Goes on like a creamy, thick foundation but soon dries to a soft powdery finish.</li>

    <li> I love the color and the feel of this Mary kay  creme to powder make up. Shipped right away and was packed accurately.</li>
    <li> LOVED IT THIS PRODUCT I USE ALL THE TIME AND NOTHING CAN TAKE ITS PLACE ITS JUST GREAT!!  I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years and I will continue using it.  It is very easy to apply and goes on smooth.  It covers all my blemishes and evens out my skin.  I wasn&#x27;t able to find a mary kay rep in my area so I decided to look for it on amazon.  I was pleased to see that I could buy this product for a cheaper price and that it came to me in perfectly new condition.</li>
    <li> I love it, my complection is difficult, I am very pale with rosy cheeks, its hard to find a foundation to even me out and this works great, complete coverage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years, thankfully it hasn&#x27;t changed or been discontinued.</li>
    <li> Foundation blends so well with my complexion.</li>
    <li> Was not compatible with beige 1 press powder. Color not dark enough</li>
