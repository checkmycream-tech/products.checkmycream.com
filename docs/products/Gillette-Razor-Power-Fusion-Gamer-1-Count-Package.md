### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great Job on thisone Gillette!  </li>
      <li>So as you can see, for me the Fusion Storm is the best shaving instrument I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>I tried to buy the Gillette Razor Power, Fusion Gamer(tm) from Best Circuit Shack, but one of the beflippered gnomes who toil there refused to sell it to me.    </li>
      <li>The end result was unshaveable at best.  </li>
      <li>A superb close shave with fewer cuts.  </li>
      <li>I could give it 5 stars because for 3 months it works perfect</li>
      <li>the Mach5 razor works perfectly well for my needs.</li>
      <li>Best a Man...\\&quot;    </li>
      <li>, let me tell you, this is the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had</li>
      <li>So as you can see, for me the Fusion Storm is the best shaving instrument I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>but I still couldn&#x27;t get perfect shave.</li>
      <li>Otherwise I don&#x27;t see what&#x27;s so great about it.</li>
      <li>5 great blades provide a great close shave even without the power turned on.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still an amazing beast, and I was highly impressed by it, but an inside source at Gillette has informed me they are working on an improved chipset that will eliminate the problems some of us are having.</li>
      <li>I was happy with that too at the time</li>
      <li>$8, this is a very nice razor.</li>
      <li>Gillette may be the best a man can get, but this one may be better suited to a woman.    </li>

      <li>/&gt;Recently I switched to the Fusion and was impressed with its closeness and smooth feel.  </li>
      <li>When I approached the counter to purchase this clearly superior shaving wand, \\&quot;Doug\\&quot; began to hammer me with questions.</li>
      <li>It gives me a good, close shave without irritation.  </li>
      <li>While it is a good razor and shaves just as I would expect a Gillette to do, I have yet to figure out the benefit of the vibrating blade.  </li>
      <li>Nice grip and attractive color.    </li>
      <li>In summary, the Gillette Razor Power, Fusion Gamer(tm) is a good razor, but it is prejudiced against non-power gamers.</li>
      <li>When I told Mike that he was going to try the Gillette Razor Power, Fusion Gamer, he just laughed.</li>
      <li>If you want a good shave, don&#x27;t look at the price, look at the results.</li>
      <li>This is a very interesting innovation.  </li>
      <li>It is nice to use and does a good job.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s more of a pleasant buzzing sensation, and was frankly kind of</li>
      <li>This thing is amazing.</li>
      <li>To conclude, I believe that the Mach Fusion is the best blade shaver money can buy and hope they will keep improving it although I don&#x27;t really know how ...</li>
      <li>I honestly feel that the company is abusing the silver trophy support with this one.</li>
      <li>is nice.    </li>
      <li>Sure it looks good on paper, but it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>and you discover how perfect the control really is.</li>
      <li>much better then you know who,why can&#x27;t anyone make a razor as good as  gillette?</li>
      <li>That being said, I was thrilled to try Gillette&#x27;s newest.  </li>
      <li>I already own a Gillette Fusion Power Phantom and a Gillette M3Power Razor.  </li>
      <li>So it&#x27;s a good shaver but wouldn&#x27;t pay lot more for the vibrating feature.</li>
      <li>I can honestly say I am a convert and will use this razor exclusively from now on.  </li>
      <li>Either that or start growing your own [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>Among the complaints in these two reviews were issues with \\&quot;lack of multiplayer support\\&quot; and \\&quot;control issues\\&quot;- honestly, is this a joke?</li>
      <li>The unsophisticated checkout girl never thought to ask, and she practically smiled at me.    </li>
      <li>He&#x27;s more of a clean-up every now and then kind of guy.</li>
      <li>This is the best Gillette razor, so far, I have ever used.</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t honestly tell you that Gillette&#x27;s five-blade safety razor provided a better shave than a [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>GILLETTE FUSION POWER GAMER RAZOR is very comfortable, both in my hand and against my skin.</li>
      <li>Perpetual, self sharpening blades maybe ?!? :-)</li>
      <li>Gillette&#x27;s ads for this thing are trying to convince us that 5 blades are better than 3.</li>
      <li>and I would gladly use it again.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Since when has it taken so many words just to name a razor?</li>
      <li>/&gt;First I called the company to make sure it was ok to use the battery powered Storm in the shower.</li>
      <li>do really like how great a job</li>
      <li>I think that, more than anything else, you have to look at the amount of depilatory content that you can access with this thing.</li>
      <li>OK, so I&#x27;ve got the Mach 3 Turbo, which has three blades, vibrates, pivots and all that.  </li>
      <li>The handle itself is very convenient (and with great colors).</li>
      <li>Well, it doesn&#x27;t seem to give me a closer shave, but it makes shaving more of an adventure, you know?</li>
      <li>Most of them wouldn&#x27;t boot up at all.  </li>
      <li>I can say that I felt foolish using the Gillette as it looks and sounds much more like a futuristic gardening tool than something I&#x27;d pack in my shaving kit.</li>
      <li>Better</li>
      <li>I like the mach 3 turbo way better.</li>
      <li>There is nothing better about this product; it&#x27;s just Marketing Gone</li>
      <li>Please, protect someone you love.  </li>
      <li>Awesome back blade placed to trim around the nose, sideburns, etc.  </li>
      <li>I have shaved with it on and without it running (many times each way) and truthfully find no difference in outcome.  </li>
      <li>Possibly the best feature on this razor.  </li>
      <li>Now, a much more lethal malady, Halo sideburns, threatens to nip the lives of our most precious resource, our post-pubescent children, in the proverbial bud.  </li>
      <li>And are 5 blades really better than 3?</li>
      <li>I wondered how much better it could get.  </li>
      <li>that point, I gave up on getting more information out of him.</li>
      <li>but the cost of the blades and the speed at which they wear out will probably keep me from buying more.</li>
      <li>While I recognize that &#x27;fusion gamers&#x27; will likely benefit from this most excellent of razors, what about those of us who prefer to split rather than fuse?</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll find something...</li>
      <li>There is nothing better about this product; it&#x27;s just Marketing Gone</li>
      <li>Believe me, there is nothing better here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I doubt you can find a better razor on the market than the Gilette Power Fusion.</li>
      <li>Maybe if I use it more it will grow on me</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s quick and easy to use, but I just wasn&#x27;t getting a good quality shave.</li>
      <li>So we were VERY excited to try this.  </li>
      <li>Buy the far superior Schtick razor!</li>
      <li>Pretty good product,</li>
      <li>Also, battery isolation is pretty good as well.</li>
      <li>Dealing with a lot of water very good, with not a single drop inside the chamber.  </li>
      <li>trying this shaver for the first time, it gave me an exceptionally close shave.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>Overall a very good device</li>
      <li>The vibration seems to help, making shaving more comfortable.</li>
      <li>Fusion did great this way eliminating the bumps and scraps of the old March 5.  </li>
      <li>At prices like this sanity would dictate that men should elect to either grow full beards or study how to use straight</li>
      <li>This can be a successful strategy and tells me Gillette is still seeking new ways to reach customers.  </li>
      <li>In particular, when do a literal side by side comparison, the Gamer did a particularly good job of getting my neck shaved closely without nicks.    </li>
      <li>Mach III razor was the best, hands down.  </li>
      <li>, I suppose it&#x27;s a fine razor</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s HUGE - I uploaded a picture of 3 blades side by side</li>
      <li>HUGE - I uploaded a picture of 3 blades side by side</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon Vine for the free sample of this razor, he liked it a lot.</li>
      <li>The Fusion Power is simply huge.</li>
      <li>The Fusion Power is simply huge.</li>
      <li>The Fusion provides a smooth ride</li>
      <li>The design of the blade is very well done and gives a real smooth shave.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was incredibly skeptical of any manual razor claiming that \\&quot;Power\\&quot; would drive a better shave.  I have been a loyal fan of the Mach3 Classic razor for a long time now... Therefore, when I received this razor, I placed it right next to my Mach3 in the shower and there it sat for about a week.  Soon...  I started shaving my neck with it.  After some time I began to shave the rest of my face with it...why?    Mach 3 vs. Gamer (Close Shave): At first I noticed a slight difference when comparing the 2, with the Gamer winning every time slightly.  Over time I became accustomed to the Gamers shave style and I can say that it definitely provides a superior close shave.    Mach 3 vs. Gamer (Comfort of Shave): In this category the Gamer wins hands down, but with one caveat...it takes some getting use to.  The vibration from the Gamer bothered me at first(mentally), but once I got use to how to take advantage of the vibration it became the clear winner in the comfort category.    Mach 3 vs. Gamer (Hard to Reach Places): I thought initially that getting under my nose would be incredibly tough with the new Gamer razor, but it really isn&#x27;t so bad.  The Mach3 classic does win this category, but only slightly and by enough to make a material difference.    Mach 3 vs. Gamer (Bloody Face/Neck Syndrome): Once again the Gamer wins here.  My face gets cut less than with the Mach3 Classic.  In particular, when do a literal side by side comparison, the Gamer did a particularly good job of getting my neck shaved closely without nicks.    Mach 3 vs. Gamer (Pricing): This is the only reason the Gamer get&#x27;s 4 stars.  The refills are pricey!    Mach 3 vs. Gamer (Overall): In a several week side-by-side comparison, I am now a Gamer enthusiast.  Outside of cost, the Gamer will provide a superior shave and produce less nicks that the original.  Getting use to the vibration took some time, but now I get why they make these razors vibrate...A superb close shave with fewer cuts.  Great Job on thisone Gillette!  Now Amazon...just give us a deal on the blades!!</li>
    <li> OK, so I&#x27;ve got the Mach 3 Turbo, which has three blades, vibrates, pivots and all that.  So when the Fusion Gamer came my way, I thought &#x27;now I&#x27;m in the big leagues!&#x27;  Five blades + a precision trimmer and the whole thing vibrates too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, after using this razor side by side with my supposedly obsolete Mach 3, I&#x27;m beginning to wonder if bigger is better.  The Fusion provides a smooth ride but I don&#x27;t find that it gives me as close a shave.  I also miss the tactile resistance that the Mach 3 give me.  And I haven&#x27;t had any luck with the precision trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I suppose it&#x27;s a fine razor but I&#x27;ll stick with my Mach 3.</li>
    <li> Personally, it&#x27;s a bit of overkill the way this thing was designed. I don&#x27;t think the enhanced electronic razor glide feature makes that much of a difference. You&#x27;ll get a great shave but its questionable whether you need this much bells and whistles with a simple, straightforward shave.</li>
    <li> This is a really odd product from several respects.  Since I am not a gamer - I am out of the loop on the meaning of the name of the product, and really could not understand what many of the other reviews were talking about.  I personally buy a razor to shave with, and if you judge this razor simply based on it&#x27;s ability to deliver a good, close, comfortable shave - then I would give it a high B+. It is nice to use and does a good job. The power function is cute, but not really sure it gave me a better shave than an equivalent razor that didn&#x27;t need a battery.</li>
    <li> Feels smooth on my face. Not sure if the vibrating thing is as effective as it seems. I tried shaving without the vibrating feature and I can&#x27;t tell the difference.  So it&#x27;s a good shaver but wouldn&#x27;t pay lot more for the vibrating feature.</li>
    <li> This is the best Gillette razor, so far, I have ever used. Why hadn&#x27;t anyone   thought about the power of electric vibration for a man&#x27;s razor? I didn&#x27;t   expect too much but after my first use, I was amazed how the vibrating   technology works on a simple razor. It shaves so clean and smooth with   vibration on (I know it sounds weird), but I don&#x27;t even need shaving cream!     The only con I have is that it works too good, and I sometimes get a tiny   cut, which is hardly visible, not to mention painless.</li>
    <li> Way back, shortly after the first 2 blade razor came out, Saturday Night Live did a \\&quot;parody\\&quot; commercial introducing a 3 blade razor, which, apparently, they thought would be ridiculous. The tag line to the commercial was, Because you&#x27;ll believe anything. Gillette apparently took them to heart and have been proving it ever since. I started shaving when all there was were single blade razors. When the 2 blade razor came out, I thought it was a significant improvement and have been using one ever since. I tried a 3 blade razor and I think there was a slight improvement, but not enough to make me change. Now I get this 5 blade plus 1 razor and I&#x27;m thinking this has desperation written all over it. Poor Gillette marketing department! Imagine having to come up with new ways to increase revenue, significantly, from a product that still does basically the same thing it always has. The pressure they must be going through now! What could possibly be next? Seriously? Gillette&#x27;s ads for this thing are trying to convince us that 5 blades are better than 3. If it is, it&#x27;s proven in minute details of highly controlled laboratory tests. On Rats. Believe me, there is nothing better here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Baby smooth skin for 12 hours - Got to admit, the smoothness is uncanny, but it doesn&#x27;t last long. I suppose if you had a hot date a smooth face would be appreciated in some situations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Price - I was surprised to see you could get replacement cartridges for an average of $2.38 each in Amazon. The price I saw in my local supermarket was almost $4 each. Still, I can get my Sensor II blades for an average of $1.23 each and they shave smooth enough for the wife (no hot dates here). Maybe a Fusion Power lasts twice as long (I don&#x27;t think so), but even so, I could change my Sensor IIs twice as often, spend the same and still have a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lack of sensory perception - This is the main reason I don&#x27;t like these mega razors: I can&#x27;t feel them on my face. If these were a car, they would be &#x27;79 Cadillacs, whose road feel was so isolated the only way you knew the car turned was by a change in scenery. I cannot tell where the razors are on my face and the vibrating feature makes it completely numb. I tend to spend more time shaving with this thing because I have to double check with my fingers to make sure I get the spot I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s HUGE - I uploaded a picture of 3 blades side by side (guess I missed the 4 blade models). Talk about blade creep! The Fusion Power is simply huge. This is another reason I don&#x27;t like these: they can&#x27;t maneuver enough to get in tight spots on your face. I sent an e-mail to Gillette complaining about this problem on their M3 Power razor and they admitted it was a problem (they suggested I also shave with a Gillette Sensor to get the tight spots). The reason the Fusion Power has a 6th blade on the back is to solve this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other annoyances - There is no apparent reason it is called \\&quot;Gamer.\\&quot; I guess it&#x27;s just another crazy marketing idea. There is no mention of Gamer or what it means anywhere else on the box. I see they also have a \\&quot;Phantom\\&quot; and \\&quot;Phenom\\&quot; version. What? Are you supposed to collect the whole series or something? One other problem is that the placement of the on/off button is such that I sometimes turn it off when I&#x27;m shaving up my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, don&#x27;t waste your money. There is nothing better about this product; it&#x27;s just Marketing Gone Wild!would be &#x27;79 Cadillacs, whose road feel was so isolated the only way you knew the car turned was by a change in scenery. I cannot tell where the razors are on my face and the vibrating feature makes it completely numb. I tend to spend more time shaving with this thing because I have to double check with my fingers to make sure I get the spot I wanted.    It&#x27;s HUGE - I uploaded a picture of 3 blades side by side (guess I missed the 4 blade models). Talk about blade creep! The Fusion Power is simply huge. This is another reason I don&#x27;t like these: they can&#x27;t maneuver enough to get in tight spots on your face. I sent an e-mail to Gillette complaining about this problem on their M3 Power razor and they admitted it was a problem (they suggested I also shave with a Gillette Sensor to get the tight spots). The reason the Fusion Power has a 6th blade on the back is to solve this problem.    Other annoyances - There is no apparent reason it is called \\&quot;Gamer.\\&quot; I guess it&#x27;s just another crazy marketing idea. There is no mention of Gamer or what it means anywhere else on the box. I see they also have a \\&quot;Phantom\\&quot; and \\&quot;Phenom\\&quot; version. What? Are you supposed to collect the whole series or something? One other problem is that the placement of the on/off button is such that I sometimes turn it off when I&#x27;m shaving up my face.    Overall, don&#x27;t waste your money. There is nothing better about this product; it&#x27;s just Marketing Gone Wild!</li>
    <li> I doubt you can find a better razor on the market than the Gilette Power Fusion. It offers a smooth, effortless shaving experience, and while the vibrating head may not make a quantifiable difference in the closeness of the shave, it certainly feels good and makes your daily routine a little more enjoyable.    The problem is, all this comes at a hefty premium. You may find refills on sale occasionally, but not at deep discounts. I&#x27;ve tried to lessen the cost by stretching blade life to one per month, but for my beard, I can start feeling more drag after about two weeks, and I&#x27;ve never been able to push it beyond three weeks.    If the extra cost isn&#x27;t a problem for you, by all means, this should be your razor of choice, but if you&#x27;re looking to save where you can, it wouldn&#x27;t be hard to find less expensive alternatives that do almost as well, admittedly with a little less pizazz.</li>
    <li> This is a souped up manual razor with five blades on one side, one on the other, a battery-powered oscillating motor to provide a vibrating buzz, and even an on-board microchip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both adults in the household wanted to try it, but being a reasonable person, I allowed the person shaving his face to go first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He says:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Uncomfortable shave:  the stubble got caught in the blades and pulled. It was better when using the other side of the razor, the precision trimmer, to first reduce the length of the hair then use the regular side (5 blades) to continue shaving.  It&#x27;s not so bad when the hair is short.&lt;br /&gt;2. Strangely enough, I got just as close a shave with my trusty old electric razor without the hassle of having to use a shaving gel or cream.&lt;br /&gt;3. Felt uncomfortable when trying to shave under my nose, so I didn&#x27;t bother.&lt;br /&gt;4. Not sure what the vibration is all about??? And are 5 blades really better than 3? If my memory serves me correctly, my really old Mach 3 razor gave me a similar shave without the vibration.&lt;br /&gt;5. It was not particularly easy to clean, and even though the hair washed out reasonably quickly from between the blades, some of it got stuck to the orange flexible comfort guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Did not irritate my skin... much.&lt;br /&gt;2. Looks cool and felt comfortably balanced in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;3. Single blade on the other side of the head was pretty good in lining my sideburns and goatee (maybe Gillette needs to get back to basics and forget about the 5 blades)&lt;br /&gt;4. Easy to pack and travel with, especially with the automatic shut off feature.&lt;br /&gt;5. Low battery indicator is a good feature for obvious reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time in years that I&#x27;ve used a manual razor and so far I cannot see any compelling reason to switch back from my electric razor. Maybe if I use it more it will grow on me but I doubt it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She says:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked pretty well on underarms and legs.  One could get quite accustomed to the vibration too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I preferred the five blade side for under arm shaving, and the one blade side for legs.  There wasn&#x27;t any irritation afterwards, and was quite a step-up from disposables.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than what \\&quot;He says\\&quot; above, I&#x27;d have to add that seeing that I don&#x27;t use an electric razor for my type of shaving, the only thing that would stop me from using this is the relatively high price of replacement blades, which of course is the thing that mints the money for Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette may be the best a man can get, but this one may be better suited to a woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. \\&quot;He says\\&quot; ain&#x27;t getting it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amanda Richards June 6, 2009blade side for under arm shaving, and the one blade side for legs.  There wasn&#x27;t any irritation afterwards, and was quite a step-up from disposables.    Other than what \\&quot;He says\\&quot; above, I&#x27;d have to add that seeing that I don&#x27;t use an electric razor for my type of shaving, the only thing that would stop me from using this is the relatively high price of replacement blades, which of course is the thing that mints the money for Gillette.    Gillette may be the best a man can get, but this one may be better suited to a woman.    P.S. \\&quot;He says\\&quot; ain&#x27;t getting it back.        Amanda Richards June 6, 2009</li>
    <li> Mine died after just a couple of uses, with flashes of red signifying a general hardware failure.    It&#x27;s still an amazing beast, and I was highly impressed by it, but an inside source at Gillette has informed me they are working on an improved chipset that will eliminate the problems some of us are having. Just have some patience - early adapters all get screwed.</li>
    <li> Lately I&#x27;ve been unhappy with my electric razor - it&#x27;s quick and easy to use, but I just wasn&#x27;t getting a good quality shave. So I was happy to try out the Fusion Power razor, which combines a manual razor with a self-contained electric motor to create a subtle vibrating action. It doesn&#x27;t shake and try to leap out of your hand...it&#x27;s more of a pleasant buzzing sensation, and was frankly kind of fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve got to say that with the multiple blades and the power function, this is probably the fastest manual shave I&#x27;ve ever had (at least without drawing blood, which I didn&#x27;t). It hugs the contours of the face easily, and really leaves a smooth, clean finish behind...no odd patches of frizz to be discovered later!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downsides really aren&#x27;t the fault of the razor; the need to use shaving cream unavoidably makes the process less convenient than using an electric. Plus, my face got some irritation (though I would imagine this will go away if I use the razor regularly). Another possible concern is the cost of replacement blades, which aren&#x27;t cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;m a work-at-home kind of guy, I&#x27;m sticking with the electric razor for everyday use, but definitely using the Gillette Fusion when I want a shave done right.</li>
    <li> I admit it.  Seldom do I shave and not end up with a face only Stephen King could love (in one of his novels).  I was hopeful that the Fusion would be different.  This was mainly because the blades are said to be closer together and I thought this might lend itself to a smoother shave without a lot of cuts.  It di.    i wasn&#x27;t disappointed at all with the results.  The blades have a \\&quot;+1\\&quot;blade which is a \\&quot;trim blade\\&quot; made for trimming in certain areas of the face.  I can&#x27;t say as its tremendously useful, but it did com in handy around the base of the nose and on the sideburns.  The package came with an extra blade and I had such great success, I bought another package of blades.  So far I am very satisfied with the razor.    Now, about the \\&quot;Gamer\\&quot; edition.  When I ordered this item, I didn&#x27;t really look closely at the \\&quot;Gamer\\&quot; identification on the package.  I have to say that Gillette is a company that has not gotten so comfortable with their brand that they are afraid to be bold with their marketing.      Do Gamer&#x27;s have tougher stubble than the rest?  I doubt it.  Since higher levels of activity will do more to stimulate hair growth than sitting in a chair and playing video games, but you still have to tip your hat to Gillette for \\&quot;creating a market\\&quot;.  This can be a successful strategy and tells me Gillette is still seeking new ways to reach customers.  When a company does something like this, we tend to benefit because it means they listen, they want to know their customers better and they are prepared to meet our needs in unconventional or new ways.    All in all, the Fusion does a great job and for me, left less cuts on my face.  Although, like all other shaving \\&quot;systems\\&quot; the blades are quite pricey, I can justify the price knowing I don&#x27;t look like I just lost a fight with an angry snake.  If you want a good shave, don&#x27;t look at the price, look at the results.</li>
    <li> Who would have thought that a little vibration would make for a smoother shave? Not me. But huh...it actually works! My legs were satiny smooth in a jiff and I have quickly grown into a believer in this product. So much so, that I only coughed for about a minute or two before biting the bullet and purchasing the outrageously priced replacement blades (yikes!).</li>
    <li> We have used the Mach 3 razor forever in our house.  So we were VERY excited to try this.  The vibration creates a \\&quot;warming\\&quot; effect the first few times you use it, and then I guess you get used to it, because I don&#x27;t notice it anymore.   Once we were used to the vibration, we all found it very comparable to the Mach 3.   Which really just illustrates that for the additional cost of the blades, it isn&#x27;t worth it.   For our family, we will stick to the Mach 3, at least until blades are much easier (and cheaper) to come by.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not 100% convinced that adding battery power to a standard razor adds a ton, but I have sensitive skin and have to shave carefully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do really like how great a job it does the first time you use the blade, and have followed others&#x27; advice to get the blades very dry after every use to prolong their lifespan.  That said, replacement blades are ridiculously expensive.  Not sure that the design or the battery power makes this razor significant better than other high-end disposables (i.e. Mach) but the cost of the blades and the speed at which they wear out will probably keep me from buying more.</li>
    <li> Overkill, thy name is Gillette! It is a wonder men managed without multiple blades, batteries and \\&quot;15 Microfins to follow the contours of your face for a comfortably close shave.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t honestly tell you that Gillette&#x27;s five-blade safety razor provided a better shave than a [[ASIN:B00070QEYY BIC Comfort Twin Blade]]. I can say that I felt foolish using the Gillette as it looks and sounds much more like a futuristic gardening tool than something I&#x27;d pack in my shaving kit. Gillette claims the AAA battery will provide \\&quot;soothing micropulses to help you reduce friction and increase razor glide.\\&quot; It certainly didn&#x27;t provide the vigorous shaking common with battery-operated or electric toothbrushes that I feared. However, Gillette states that the razor can be used with or without the battery power, which leads me to believe that the extra bells and whistles are more for show than for shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step back a moment and consider this is a $10 razor with replacement cartridges that cost about $5 each! At prices like this sanity would dictate that men should elect to either grow full beards or study how to use straight razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If price alone isn&#x27;t a deterrent consider the amount of waste that goes into these disposable razors. According to Wikipedia&#x27;s citation for razors, \\&quot;Straight razors were the most common form of shaving before the 20th century and remained that common in many countries until the 1950s.\\&quot; There are several great beginner&#x27;s straight razors available, including the [[ASIN:B001GMTKCK Dovo Shavette Straight Razor with Black Handle]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, you can save yourself money (and be more environmentally friendly) by selecting a straight razor instead of this overwrought, battery-operated monstrosity from Gillette. Either that or start growing your own [[ASIN:B0002J58K6 Grizzly Adams]] man beard; with the money you save you can build a log cabin in the mountains in no time soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rating: two stars (deducting two stars for value and one star for ridiculous features)ous features)</li>
    <li> I just keep thinking of the Saturday Night Live commercial for the \\&quot;Triple Track.\\&quot; It was one of the first SNL commercials, and at the time, twin blade razors were all the rage. The fake triple blade commercial ended with the tag line, \\&quot;Because you&#x27;ll believe anything.\\&quot; That was 1975. When a real triple track came along I tried it and used it until this year, skipping the four-blade revolution altogether. (Hey, I still like Bit &#x60;o Honey, so sue me.) I finally traded up this year to the *gulp* five blade GILLETTE FUSION POWER GAMER RAZOR. Since when has it taken so many words just to name a razor? I guess one word for each blade, huh? Well, not to be out-done, I&#x27;m giving it one star for each blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The GILLETTE FUSION POWER GAMER RAZOR is very comfortable, both in my hand and against my skin. As an added bit of bling, it vvvvibrates. Is that really needed? Does it help? Well, it doesn&#x27;t seem to give me a closer shave, but it makes shaving more of an adventure, you know? They sell a version without the vibro-massage feature for $1 less, but what&#x27;s an extra $1 for a razor when you&#x27;re going to get it in the shorts anyway when you go to buy the blades?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For $8, this is a very nice razor. The build quality is high, the design is comfortable, and the jiggling handle is exciting. Be careful not to accidentally turn off the massage feature while you&#x27;re shaving. It&#x27;s like someone shutting off the music while you&#x27;re dancing. Very jarring.</li>
    <li> So the Gillette Fusion Power razor has a battery which when turned on vibrates the razor. Not really sure what this is supposed to improve but that&#x27;s what it does. I didn&#x27;t notice any difference between this razor and the standard Gillette razor. The only difference I could see was the vibration. I guess if you want to feel like your doing an electric shave with a regular razor than this is the gadget for you!! Otherwise I don&#x27;t see what&#x27;s so great about it.</li>
    <li> I tried this out without really expecting much and was hugely surprised with the result!  This razor combined the efficiency of multiple super sharp blades with a battery powered vibrating action that gave me probably the smoothest shave I have ever had.  A \\&quot;normal\\&quot; razor often bounces over tough stubble and causes me to have to go over the spot repeatedly.  This Power Fusion razor simply powered straight through the toughest of stubble on one pass and left nothing but smooth skin behind.  If you are someone who suffers from razor burn, I would imagine this razor will help that immensely.  I can honestly say I am a convert and will use this razor exclusively from now on.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> The handle itself is very convenient (and with great colors). Although it feels bit lighter than the steel handle, it still give enough comfort and precision.   Battery life is great (as long as you remember shutting it of after each shave). Also, battery isolation is pretty good as well. Dealing with a lot of water very good, with not a single drop inside the chamber.  The razor itself is good, but my skin likes it less than the normal MACH3, so I guess I would suggest trying it first with a normal handle, before purchasing this one.  The sad thing is that I already have a MACH3 power (vibrating) handle, so why do I need to buy yet another one, to enjoy it with the FUSION razor?</li>
    <li> Some years back I bought and used for a while a Norelco electric shaver. Fancy device but after some time I was annoyed by the fact that my skin was always irritated by it. Then I decided to go back to blades. Since then, the brand that I use exclusively is Gillette. I used all the Machs including the Fusion.  To my shame, I don&#x27;t know exactly what the \\&quot;Fusion Gamer\\&quot; means and frankly I don&#x27;t really care, as this review is for the Fusion shaver.    A previous reviewer was questioning if one really needs 5 blades... In my opinion having them helps tremendously. Before the Fusion razor, we had 3 blades. I was happy with that too at the time but often I would have to do 2 passes in order to get shaved right. With the 5 blades, one pass is always enough, even after a few days. The other thing that I like is that since this thing has so many blades, it seems to be easier on the skin with less to no irritation.  The trimmer is an added bonus and it helps with hard to reach places like the corners of the nose. Some places are hard to reach with the shaver also because it has 5 blades and that makes it thick.    The vibration seems to help, making shaving more comfortable. I don&#x27;t exactly know how but it does help. I never forgot to shut the vibration off after a shave but knowing that the Fusion Power has a timer for automatic shutoff is nice.    To conclude, I believe that the Mach Fusion is the best blade shaver money can buy and hope they will keep improving it although I don&#x27;t really know how ... I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll find something... Perpetual, self sharpening blades maybe ?!? :-)</li>
    <li> This one joins list of failed products created without engineering merits. Intel Pentium 4, Microsoft Vista etc. Sure it looks good on paper, but it doesn&#x27;t work. Just increasing the clock speed of chip without considering the thermal issues made Pentium 4 a big failure.     5 blades is just a waste, normal 3 blade shaver does as good or better than this one. i would just rate it what ever or dont bother.</li>
    <li> As a standard, refillable, manual razor I would gladly recommend this product.  It gives me a good, close shave without irritation.  I don&#x27;t quite get the concept of including power in a razor like this, though, and from my experience the slight vibration this power provides doesn&#x27;t result in an improved shave.  If anything, it helps clean the blades when they are rinsed under water, but apart from that I&#x27;m not sure the power adds anything to the razor.</li>
    <li> The Gillette fusion new multi pack is dangerous and should be recalled.  The original is still the best, the new with cheap white plastic should be recalled or listed as dangerous to the user. The white plastic handle is too thin to grasp and hold in position with a wet hand. First time I used it I sliced a one and a half inch strip from my scalp. I have been shaving my head for quite a few years and first time for this slippery little beauty, a very nasty cut not with one blade but the full 5. Stick to the original well designed product not the introduction of a cheap plastic dangerous product</li>
    <li> I just read some reviews of this over at Gamespot and 1UP, and, wow, what can I say?    It got a 7.1 and a 8.3, respectively. Hello??? What were these idiots shaving with? Because it sure as HELL wasn&#x27;t this razor, which deserves an easy 10 (which the one place with integrity, apparently, IGN, gave it). Among the complaints in these two reviews were issues with \\&quot;lack of multiplayer support\\&quot; and \\&quot;control issues\\&quot;- honestly, is this a joke? It&#x27;s a single player product, end of story. I guess it could be cool to have a multiplayer option but it&#x27;s really besides the point, and it&#x27;s unfair to review it poorly based on what isn&#x27;t there- it&#x27;s like saying a car is bad because it can&#x27;t fly! They should have just looked to the elegance and innovation of the single-shave experience. Which brings me to the other issue- control? I am sick of these reviewers blaming their poor performance on the peripherals or software. Why not own up and acknowledge that they just don&#x27;t have the skill? Invest some time and get to know the finer points of this razor and you discover how perfect the control really is. Sure, there are some unusual choices but that just shows how committed Gillette is to innovation. But enough about it- this whole thing makes me sick.    Maybe NOW people will wake up and realize what many of us have known for a long time- they&#x27;ve been getting paid by Schick, probably for years... so long gamer journalism, it was nice knowing you.</li>
    <li> I tried to buy the Gillette Razor Power, Fusion Gamer(tm) from Best Circuit Shack, but one of the beflippered gnomes who toil there refused to sell it to me.    When I approached the counter to purchase this clearly superior shaving wand, \\&quot;Doug\\&quot; began to hammer me with questions. \\&quot;What&#x27;s your favorite game? What are the other names of Jenova? How many alts do you have in WoW? Have you ever run a CS server?\\&quot; Flustered, I could only stammer out thin excuses. \\&quot;Doug\\&quot; grew suspicious and hustled me into the back. There he strapped me down to an Ultimate Game Chair(tm) and poured Mountain Dew Game Fuel(tm) into my ears until I confessed I only owned a second-hand Dreamcast.    They kicked me out, taunting me as I left defeated. However, once in the car, I managed to drive at twice the speed of Twitter and bought a Gillette Razor Power, Fusion Gamer(tm) from Target, cleverly bookending it with a bag of Cheetos(tm) and a copy of \\&quot;Puru Puru Ne Sho Ma Machinehead Samurai Kitty\\&quot;. The unsophisticated checkout girl never thought to ask, and she practically smiled at me.    I went home and shaved. My chin is now hairless.    In summary, the Gillette Razor Power, Fusion Gamer(tm) is a good razor, but it is prejudiced against non-power gamers. 3 stars.</li>
    <li> The razor cartridge of this razor is too large. It is difficult to tell precisely where the razor blades are on your face or head (I shave my head). The sixth blade on the back of the razor cartridge made me nervous when shaving around my ears. I was worried about nicking an earlobe.    The micropulse feature was nice, but the major draw of a razor is the razor blades, and this razor cartridge is too unwieldy. I will be sticking with my Mach 3 Turbo for the foreseeable future.</li>
    <li> This is a very interesting innovation.  The device is a standard razor, albeit with 5 primary blades, with a battery.  That is right a battery.  The battery provides a vibration on the razor head when activated.  Besides a low battery light this seems to be the only function using the battery.    Pros:  1.  5 great blades provide a great close shave even without the power turned on.  Better then my old 3 blade device but not sure if it is that much better.  2. Awesome back blade placed to trim around the nose, sideburns, etc.  Possibly the best feature on this razor.  3. Nice grip and attractive color.    Cons:  1.  I really can&#x27;t see where the battery vibration makes the shave any closer or less painful then with this feature turned off.  2. The replacement blades are very expensive and are making me think twice about extended use of this device.    Overall a very good device but I am unsure if I will replace the battery or if I would pay for a like feature again.</li>
    <li> When I told Mike that he was going to try the Gillette Razor Power, Fusion Gamer, he just laughed. \\&quot;Why would a gamer need a special razor?\\&quot;, he asked. Imagine our surprise when we realized you actually hooked the razor up to a game controller and shaved your face that way! Okay, not really. But it does take a battery, which is kind of weird. I waited excitedly. Mike has a very full beard and doesn&#x27;t shave daily. He&#x27;s more of a clean-up every now and then kind of guy. I waited...waited....waited...until the day came! So I excitedly asked about the razor.&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;It was fine\\&quot;, he said.&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Was the vibration weird\\&quot;, I asked.&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I could hardly feel it\\&quot;, he answered.&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Well, did you like it\\&quot;, I retorted.&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I mean, it worked fine. It was just as good as any other razor I&#x27;ve used. But I still can&#x27;t figure out what makes it specifically for a gamer....\\&quot; he said.&lt;br /&gt;At that point, I gave up on getting more information out of him. So there you have it, The Gillette Razor Power, Fusion Gamer.....\\&quot;just as good as any other razor\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;In the end, he gave it a 4 star rank, because he \\&quot;liked the fact that there is a detailing razor on the backside of it.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I have long thought of Gillette to be the Godfather of all razors.  I have been using my Excel for years and have always felt it outdid any competitor I got the urge to try once in awhile.  No matter what, I always ended up going back to my Excel.  That being said, I was thrilled to try Gillette&#x27;s newest.  While it is a good razor and shaves just as I would expect a Gillette to do, I have yet to figure out the benefit of the vibrating blade.  I have shaved with it on and without it running (many times each way) and truthfully find no difference in outcome.  I hate to give Gillette a bad review as I truly believe they make great products but this razor truly is a gimmick.  It is incredibly expensive -- buying the razor, maintaining batteries, and replacing blades (which are absurdly priced, even at wholesale clubs).  The blades do not last as long as typical Gillette blades (I&#x27;m guessing the vibrations wear it down faster) so you are forced to replace the blades at a much quicker rate which increases the already excessive pricetag for owning this system.  I would advise against this razor and suggest sticking to Gillette&#x27;s traditional line -- they are far better and far more economical.  I never would have guessed Gillette to market such a gimmick -- what a disappointment for a brand I have always loved.</li>
    <li> Gillette has done it again with a quality version of their existing line of shaving products. The design of the blade is very well done and gives a real smooth shave. Definitely a step up from Mach 3. The small 6th blade on the top is good for those awkward corners. I am not sure about how much difference the battery power offers. Overall a quality product!</li>
    <li> I ordered this item for my husband and this is his review:&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;After trying this shaver for the first time, it gave me an exceptionally close shave.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed in that the sixth blade that came with the Gamestop Collector&#x27;s Edition was not available for purchase at least as downloadable content for those who didn&#x27;t pre-order.  My only hope now is to find one used as a trade-in.  The blade works so-so when shaving while playing Left4Dead, and the actual blood spurting from your neck when you yank it accidentally during a surprise zombie rush really adds to the realism.    Bonus for those people still playing with CRT screens -- the reflective glass works like a mirror so you can shave without having to use the EyeToy or Live Vision Camera to see yourself, and since the razor runs on batteries, you can even do this during a power outage with sufficient candle light in front of your TV.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe all the hype over this razor, any one with a brain can see it&#x27;s just two Mach3&#x27;s duct taped together. It&#x27;s a gimmick that no one&#x27;s going to care about in a few months.    The cartridges are the same thing that was on the last razor, just with \\&quot;vibration\\&quot; tacked on. Talk about lame. When all these stupid Gillette fanboys wake up they&#x27;ll see that the Schick Quattro is the REAL Next Generation razor!</li>
    <li> While I recognize that &#x27;fusion gamers&#x27; will likely benefit from this most excellent of razors, what about those of us who prefer to split rather than fuse? As a fission gamer, I find that I&#x27;m rarely given the representation that I feel I deserve in the shaving market. Until Gillette realizes that fission gamers exist as well, I&#x27;m afraid I will have to boycott (or, as I am a fully grown man, mancott) their product line. Fortunately, as a fan of Barry Allen (AKA The Flash) the Mach5 razor works perfectly well for my needs.</li>
    <li> Gives a good clean shave faster the a traditional throwaway blade..  Still hard to get hair from between the blades to keep shaving.. Closer shave than electric, but I don&#x27;t know how much the vibrating helps...It does seem to help some, as the shave goes a little faster...Pretty good product, but I see where refills are expensive..  .</li>
    <li> Kudos to Gillette for being the first company to recognize that the stubble created by days of gaming cannot be shaven by any ordinary tool made by modern man.  In the 80&#x27;s, many a man succumbed to \\&quot;Donkey Kong Beard\\&quot;, a near-fatal illness which would befall only the most frequent denizens of the mall arcade.  Now, a much more lethal malady, Halo sideburns, threatens to nip the lives of our most precious resource, our post-pubescent children, in the proverbial bud.  Please, protect someone you love.  Buy them the Gillette Razor Power, Fusion Gamer today.  Nothing else will combat Gamer Stubble.</li>
    <li> much better then you know who,why can&#x27;t anyone make a razor as good as  gillette?</li>
    <li> My husband used this razor and relayed the message to me that this razor shaved closer than regular blades, but the vibration made no difference in the way it cut, or got closer. He tried it off, and then on the vibrate mode, and there was no difference in the closeness of the shave. Although he said the shave is very close because of the five blades, he said it&#x27;s not worth it for the price you pay. Thanks Amazon Vine for the free sample of this razor, he liked it a lot.</li>
    <li> I already own a Gillette Fusion Power Phantom and a Gillette M3Power Razor.  When the initial specs for the Gillette Fusion Power Gamer were announced, we were promised 100% backwards-compatibility.  This was great news, as I already had several cartridges from the previous systems.  Being able to use those old cartridges was a major factor when I decided to upgrade.  Apparently that promise to a back seat to cost-saving measures, as the current compatibility is practically non-existent.  NONE of my GMP3 cartridges would work with the GFPG.  They literally would not fit.  I looked for an expansion slot, but I couldn&#x27;t find anything.  The GFPP cartridges actually fit, but I had terrible results.  Of the ones I tried, only two actually worked.  Most of them wouldn&#x27;t boot up at all.  Some of them would work for a minute or two and then just lock up.  Even the ones that \\&quot;worked\\&quot; had resolution issues.  They produced a very grainy texture and had a ridiculous amount of pop-up.  The end result was unshaveable at best.  And the last cartridge I tried ended up bricking the GFPG.  That&#x27;s right, the unit will no longer power up.  Totally dead.  WTF am I supposed to do with a razor that won&#x27;t turn on?  There are rumors of a firmware upgrade in the near future, so hopefully these issues (not GMP3 obviously) will be resolved.  In the meantime, I suggest people avoid this product, or at the very least avoid using GFPP cartridges until backwards compatibility is confirmed.</li>
    <li> Although I have not personally used this product, my boyfriend has, and I can guarantee that it had an immediate effect on his Attractiveness rating.  The Fusion Gamer is very newbie-friendly; it teaches you how to shave through a quick and easy in-shave Gillette tutorial.  Controls are generally intuitive, although it would&#x27;ve been nice if it came with shaving cream -- most shavers do these days, so for the Fusion to require this as add-on content is just cheap.    Cons: there are some camera issues, especially when you&#x27;re trying to shave under the chin.  Also, the AI is a little buggy, and he had to keep turning the razor on and off whenever it got hung up in a certain area.  Finally, the targetting could really use some work as the razor kept trying to shave off parts of his facial hair that he wanted to keep.</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing. Not only am I a gamer, I&#x27;m also a hardcore beard-grower. Normal razors just didn&#x27;t do it for me -- they usually broke, shattering microscopic pieces of razor everywhere.    Not this puppy.    As soon as I took it out of the package, I could actually feel my beard shift away in fear. But there would be no hiding from this blade.    A few quick strokes and my gamer-beard was no more!    Also: if you want to get the achievement for shaving in under a minute, skip the lathering stage -- it&#x27;s way too time-consuming and you&#x27;ll never make it. Just go straight for the beard and those 50 points will be yours.</li>
    <li> As a eunuch dwelling in my sainted mother&#x27;s basement, I have little problem with hair growth - unwanted or otherwise.  I must commend this product for its Daily Power, though - at the mere cost of a Healing Surge, I can make a dwarf look like an overgrown halfling, and dragonborn scales shear right off as well.  This Razor is versatile and powerful, and the fusion power is the envy of all the Utah chemists.  Wish me luck, I&#x27;m taking on a den of Shifters in the morning...</li>
    <li> I bought one of these when it was first released.   I used it every day, sometimes multiple sessions in one day.   Recently I started noticing that I was being cut around my mouth in three places, the blood trickling in a circle around my mouth.   I went online and noticed that many people are having the same issue!   Gillette knows about it, but the lag time to get a razor fixed is in the months.  New razors in the new &#x27;stubble&#x27; design don&#x27;t have this issue anymore.   Some users have had luck taking one of the grips from a &#x27;stubble&#x27; razor without the problem, and grafting it onto the old razor, but Gillette should recall all of these and fix them for the consumer!   Would not buy until problem is solved!</li>
    <li> Who does Gillette think they&#x27;re fooling? Don&#x27;t buy this crap. Yes I know IGN gave it an 8.3, and to that I say: HELLLOOOOO! PAID OFF. Yes, Gillette obviously paid for that review. Despicable right? Well that&#x27;s Gillette for you. Buy the far superior Schtick razor! This is their year with all kinds of exclusive blades, skins and shaving gel coming by Fall. What does Gillette have? Nothing but overheating issues and a failure rate of at least 60%!!!    This is the year of Schtick. Don&#x27;t buy into this gimmicky crap!</li>
    <li> I received this shaver from the Amazon Vine program and immediately inserted the battery and gave it a shot.  The vibrating feature seems a bit gimmicky, and I&#x27;m not sure if it actually did anything to the stubble on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The five blade system does it&#x27;s job, leaving a very smooth trail on my face and overall a clean shave that I was glad to have had.  With no missed spots and no real burn on my face this razor did it&#x27;s job and I would gladly use it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The extra blade, used to \\&quot;edge\\&quot; seems to be better in theory than actual practice.  In order to use it, you need to hold the razor at an awkward angle and it really didn&#x27;t seem to edge anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a very positive review for Gillete&#x27;s newest razor.</li>
    <li> This is a Gilette Razor with a \\&quot;power\\&quot; component.  The power comes from a battery that is supposed to make the razor vibrate in order to give a closer shave.    So, since I am a woman, I had my husband try out this product.  He, being a scientist, took it to heart, and did several tests to determine whether this product was good or better than his Mach III razor (a similar razor without the battery component, also made by Gilette).  Here is what he did:    He shaved once part of his face with his regular razor.    He shaved another part of his face with the Gilette Fusion Power razor with it turned on.    He shaved the last part of his face with the Gilette Fusion Power razor with it turned off.      His conclusions were:    -His Mach III razor was the best, hands down.  It gave him a closer shave than the Gilette Fusion Power razor.    -The Gilette Fusion Power with the power turned on did no better than when it was turned off.  In fact, he said he couldn&#x27;t tell the difference in terms of the closeness of the shave at all.    He has not used the razor since.  Sigh.</li>
    <li> So when I ran out of blades for my Gillette mach 3 turbo, the blades at the store were like $13-15 and the fusion gamer power was like $11, so I decided I will try this new thing out and see if it is better. It isn&#x27;t. I do think I got a little close shave, but it wasn&#x27;t worth the awkwardness and it is very uncomfortable. The vibrations just feel very unnatural. My face is red after, I never had that problem with my mach 3 turbo. i am going to go back to the mach 3 turbo. The other con i that the fusion power models are all huge and very big, so it&#x27;s hard to hold and get it close on small spots. I like the mach 3 turbo way better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for over 20 years, and like many other men, tried many different razors, remedies and routines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For nearly 10 years I was a devotee of the Mach 5 Turbo which was \\&quot;good enough\\&quot; but left scrapes and bumps and could be a bit rough at times of since I shave every morning 6 days a week.  Besides, it left hard to reach hairs behind like those under the nose and on the sides of the lips and the nook of the chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently I switched to the Fusion and was impressed with its closeness and smooth feel.  With both the Mach 5 Turbo and Fusion I used shave oil rather than gel or cream, but also recently went back to an old method I&#x27;d used in college of shaving in the shower with just steam and water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Fusion did great this way eliminating the bumps and scraps of the old March 5.  Plus, it got more of the hard to reach hairs and had a straight razor back edge for better trimming.  So when I had the opportunity to try the Fusion Storm I wondered how much better it could get.  I was also a little skeptical that the vibrating action had any value.&lt;br /&gt;Well, let me tell you, this is the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had and my life has been majorly improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I called the company to make sure it was ok to use the battery powered Storm in the shower. Gillette gave the thumbs-up and advised to not submerge it in a pool of water but it was tested for shower shavers like me.  Next I tried it on a normal weekday morning after having shaved the day before. It was like the hair jumped off my face with no irritation and all the hard to reach hairs were gone. The first shave was so smooth and irritation free I completely forgot to use after shave lotion, a part of the routine for years. I continued on this way for the next few days, with the same great results, but I did add the after shave lotion back in for no other reason than I&#x27;m a bit superstitious and I&#x27;d already paid for the stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I&#x27;d thought I&#x27;d really test the Fusion Storm. I skipped the Friday shave and also went rough neck over the weekend and didn&#x27;t shave again until Monday morning. This totaled four full days since I have shaved (clock started ticking after the Thursday morning shower-shave routine). Now for me, a few days of not shaving leaves me with a face full of thick stubble. Monday morning rolled around and the Fusion Storm glided through it without so much as a snag or pull. Still didn&#x27;t need the after shave lotion, but used it for reasons described earlier.  So as you can see, for me the Fusion Storm is the best shaving instrument I&#x27;ve ever used. Whether it&#x27;s the 5 closely spaced blades, the lubrication strips, the vibrating action or straight razor I can&#x27;t say. But the combination makes the Storm my new favorite product and one that has drastically improved my life.shave and also went rough neck over the weekend and didn&#x27;t shave again until Monday morning.

    <li> Using this razor only gave me 3 bronze and 1 silver trophy.  I understand that companies want to make the coveted gold and platinum trophies rare, but  this is ridiculous.  Here are the current trophies:    \\&quot;Package Master\\&quot;       \\&quot;Open Package\\&quot;         Bronze  \\&quot;Face Scalper\\&quot;         \\&quot;Shave\\&quot;                Bronze  \\&quot;Trim the Fat\\&quot;         \\&quot;Use Trimmer\\&quot;          Bronze  \\&quot;The Best a Man...\\&quot;    \\&quot;Buy a replacement\\&quot;    Silver     I honestly feel that the company is abusing the silver trophy support with this one.</li>
    <li> 2009 is surely the Year of the PS3, and exciting new exclusives like this will cement its position as market and innovation leader. XBots may crow about the Schick FaceBoxLive 360, but their desperation is as plain as the fear on their stubbly unwashed faces. It goes without saying that the graphics on this are first rate - powered by the unrivaled Cell Processor, this is a razor that looks so real you would almost swear you could reach out and hold it in your hand. And of course the stunning Playstation Network leverages the promise of user content to the fullest, allowing you (with a few hours of effort) to shave your own faces rather than the manufacturer supplied faces, which are admittedly a bit spotty.</li>
    <li> I think that, more than anything else, you have to look at the amount of depilatory content that you can access with this thing. The description lists \\&quot;trim sideburns, shave under your nose, or shape facial hair, such as goatees, soul patches, and chinstrap beards\\&quot;, as if that were an exceptional number of quest zones or something. Look, I shave my head, OK, and you really haven&#x27;t lived until you&#x27;ve negotiated the tricky Temple Plains, the Unseen Back Of The Skull, and The Fiddly Bits Around The Ears. Does your Razor Power Fusion Gamer Lamer Shamer do that? Well, probably, but the question is, does it do it well? And we&#x27;re not even talking about the rest of the body, in particular the Southern Forbidden Zones.     I think that this is a case of using a molybdenum-beryllium laser-guided hammer to hang pictures with. I might get one just for a laugh, but I can&#x27;t really see subscribing long-term, let alone investing in upgrades.</li>
    <li> I decided to write review because I bought it in august and I still use original blade, without charging battery and without any malfunction.  The blade still has green line so I think it will last 2 weeks, before green line disappears. I could give it 5 stars because for 3 months it works perfect but I still couldn&#x27;t get perfect shave. maybe I don&#x27;t use the right foam or something anyway buy it. I like it very much. also I shave every three days, not before not after.</li>
