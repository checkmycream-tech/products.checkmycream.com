      <li>I LOVE IT MY FACE</li>
      <li>after I started using this product, i didn&#x27;t need to use foundation and my skin looks healthy and the pores somehow seem to close up.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve switched between this and Vanicream, gradually using this more often as my skin adapts.   </li>
      <li>Let me add that I&#x27;m 26 and figured that a free sample of moisturizer couldn&#x27;t hurt anyone.  </li>
      <li>One night I broke out in a rash on my face with the similar description as others have experienced.  </li>
      <li>Enjoy your blooming skin this spring.</li>
      <li>Followed directions, started with clean face.</li>
      <li>Any effective product is going to contain, most likely, some type of acid</li>
      <li>I have tried several products and this one is the best so far.  </li>
      <li>My skin is brighter, healthy looking and vibrant.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It is the only cream I have found (and have tried many!)</li>
      <li>I also use it w/ the day product,well worth the money</li>
      <li>Day One, it itched until absorbed by my skin.</li>
      <li>Feels &amp; smells clean, if I don&#x27;t use it for a few days my skin doesn&#x27;t look as bright.</li>
      <li>My skin is more even, I have less acne, and my skin holds moisture much better than before I began using this product.</li>
      <li>Day Two, more itching, a little more bothersome.</li>
      <li>Glad I&#x27;m not the only one.  </li>
      <li>I am so glad that I only used this product one time.  </li>
      <li>I love this product ,it has given my skin a definite glow.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have problems for the first 2 weeks, then I woke up one morning with a severe rash all over my face.</li>
      <li>Used the product for several weeks and everything was going fine.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Use a little, warm it up on your fingertips and apply.  </li>
      <li>I KEEPT USING THE PRODUCT FOR 8 STRAIGHT NIGHT, GUEES WHAT??</li>
      <li>By morning my whole face was swollen, my eyes, lips and everything burned.  </li>
      <li>I HOPE THEY REALLY GO AWAY.</li>
      <li>JUST BE VERY CAREFULL</li>
      <li>MY FACE GOT VERY SWOLLEN</li>
      <li>I WAS REALLY</li>
      <li>It did irriate my skin at first, but I have sensitive skin, so everything does.  </li>
      <li>Because the new technology breaks down some of the cellular debris, make sure you wash your face w/water afterwards and don&#x27;t let your skin go out</li>
      <li>The night version smells a bit like coffee to me (in a good way) and is very thick.</li>
      <li>Anew Alternative requires a full commitment for the long haul, if you are to achieve the results you want.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the extra expense!!!!!!!</li>
      <li>As a 50+ gal w/very sensitive skin I&#x27;m always on the lookout for products using new technology that really work.  </li>
      <li>Very itchy, red and very swollen.  </li>
      <li>Better safe than sorry!</li>
      <li>I ORDER THE DEEP CREASE FIRST</li>
      <li>, I HAD RED BLOTCHES ALL OVER MY FACE, IT WAS VERY ITCHY,LIKE BEE STUNGS</li>
      <li>The next day my face swelled up so much I almost couldnt see.</li>
      <li>I do not have sensitive skin, so I ignored the reviews here that mentioned skin irritation.</li>
      <li>Your skin, especially if it&#x27;s sensitive (like mine) and if you&#x27;re not currently using a glycolic acid product, will take some time getting used to this.  </li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t wash it off fast enough.</li>
      <li>WHAT YOU BUY , EVEN IF YOU DONT HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN, I DIDNT AND LOOK WHAT HAPPEND.</li>
      <li>Now my skin has quit reacting to it, and all of my crow&#x27;s feet, laugh lines, and other wrinkles are gone.  </li>
      <li>Used this product the first time and the next morning my face was red, swollen and itchy.</li>
      <li>No big deal, I can live with that.</li>
      <li>Shame on Avon for putting out a product that has such negative side effects on many people.</li>
      <li>This is a long-term treatment -- it&#x27;s not a quick fix like Preparation H, which can remove (via shrinking the tissues) eye wrinkles quickly but just for a short time.  </li>
      <li>I suspected this product caused the reaction since I don&#x27;t have any food allergies, but after reading the other reviews I am certain it was the cream.  </li>
      <li>This compound works well on smooth surfaces, such as one&#x27;s upper cheekbones, but it fails completely for areas such as elbows that have permanent wrinkles.  </li>

<li> It is extremely itchy on my chin, around my mouth and on cheeks.  </li>
<li> I tried the Anew product this past weekend and within hours of applying to my face and neck, my skin swelled and a red, itchy bumpy rash broke out on all areas where this product was applied.  </li>

<li> I have been using this product for my dark circles since 20 days.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m a little worried after reading the other reviews.  </li>
<li> If I could rate this product at less than zero, I would.  </li>
<li> The itching has stopped and swelling and redness has improved, but my skin looks a mess.  </li>
<li> I feel sorry for those with sensitive skin!</li>
<li> By the next day, the rash was worse.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had painful cystic acne for 20 years and this is THE FIRST cream that I&#x27;ve used that doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out</li>
<li> I used it every other night for less than a week and developed a terrible allergic reaction in the form of a red bumpy rash.  </li>
<li> Based on the reviews I&#x27;ve read, I would continue the patch test for at least a month before using it on face or neck.  </li>
<li> I too have a rash and it seems to be getting worse</li>
<li> The swelling and itching got worse as the day passed, and I ended up in an Urgent Care clinic.</li>

<li> IS MY 5 DAY AND STILL GOT THE RASH LOT LESS , BUT MY FACE LOOKS BAD.</li>
<li> I feel sorry for the people who can&#x27;t use this</li>
<li> I&#x27;m sorry to hear that others have had a reaction to this product.</li>

<li> further.(I&#x27;ve tried the expensive department store brands, the cheapo drug store brands and the very expensive creams from my dermatologist.)</li>

<li> HOW BAD IT WAS MY FACE.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I tried the Anew product this past weekend and within hours of applying to my face and neck, my skin swelled and a red, itchy bumpy rash broke out on all areas where this product was applied.  I washed my face thorougly and applied Cortizone cream which stopped the rash from getting worse and it  started going away within 24 hours.  I really like Avon product but wish Avon would stay away from using such harsh chemicals in their cosmetics.</li>
    <li> LET ME TELL YOU HOW EVERYTHING STARTED,, I WHEN ON A TRIP TO SEE MY MOTHER AFTER 3 YEARS, WHEN I SAW HER I WAS AMAZE HOW HER FACE LOOK ,, SO RADIANT AND HER FACIAL LINES WAS ALMOST GONE. I WAS IMPRESS. &lt;br /&gt;I ASK MY MOTHER WHAT ARE YOU USING THAT YOU LOOK MUCH YOUNGER THAN 3 YEARS AGO,  SHE REPLY, ANEW ALTERNATIVE AND ANEW CLINICAL DEEP CREASE. &lt;br /&gt;SO I TOLD HER I WAS GOING TO USE THE SAME THING WHEN I CAME BACK HOME CUASE I WAS REALLY AMAZE HER FACE LOOKS. &lt;br /&gt;AFTER I CAME BACK I ORDER THE DEEP CREASE FIRST, USE IT FOR 2 WEEKS EVERYTHING WAS GOING GOOD, THEN 2 WEEKS AFTER I USE THE ANEW INETNSIVE REGIMEN, &lt;br /&gt;THE FISRT NIGHT I LOVE IT MY FACE LOOK RADIANT &amp; SOFTER. I KEEPT USING THE PRODUCT FOR 8 STRAIGHT NIGHT, GUEES WHAT?? THE 9 DAY I BROKE OUT WITH A RASH MY FACE GOT VERY SWOLLEN, I HAD RED BLOTCHES ALL OVER MY FACE, IT WAS VERY ITCHY,LIKE BEE STUNGS ALL OVER SO I CALL MY DOCTOR HE GAVE ME BENADRYL, NOTHING HAPPEN MY FACE WAS GETTING WORST, I WHENT TO SE MY DR AGAIN HE PUT ME ON A VERY STRONG MEDICATION CORTICOSTEROIDE HORMONE THATS HOW BAD IT WAS MY FACE. &lt;br /&gt;TODAY IS MY 5 DAY AND STILL GOT THE RASH LOT LESS , BUT MY FACE LOOKS BAD. &lt;br /&gt;SWOLEN GOT REDUCE ALOT BUT STILL WITH RED BLOTCHES I HOPE THEY REALLY GO AWAY. &lt;br /&gt;PLEASE JUST BE VERY CAREFULL WHAT YOU BUY , EVEN IF YOU DONT HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN, I DIDNT AND LOOK WHAT HAPPEND.</li>
    <li> Used this product the first time and the next morning my face was red, swollen and itchy. The next day my face swelled up so much I almost couldnt see. Now I am on Prednisone to get the swelling down, cortisone for the redness and Benedryl for the itchy going on day 4 now...never, ever reaction to all the other products I have ever used in my 38 years. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT UNLESS YOU WANT TO PAD YOUR DOCTORS RETIREMENT!</li>
    <li> I love this product ,it has given my skin a definite glow. I feel sorry for the people who can&#x27;t use this, I think it is my fav Avon product. Feels &amp; smells clean, if I don&#x27;t use it for a few days my skin doesn&#x27;t look as bright. I hate to run out of this. I also use it w/ the day product,well worth the money</li>
    <li> This product contains glycolic acid.  Your skin, especially if it&#x27;s sensitive (like mine) and if you&#x27;re not currently using a glycolic acid product, will take some time getting used to this.  *Breaking News* There isn&#x27;t a \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; way to effectively even skintone or reduce fine lines.  Any effective product is going to contain, most likely, some type of acid and you&#x27;re going to need to use it as your skin tolerates it.  I recommend that you follow the directions (apply 15 min. after cleansing) and if you notice redness/sensitivity treat it like a benzoyl peroxide product (go find an acne med and read the directions). I&#x27;ve switched between this and Vanicream, gradually using this more often as my skin adapts.   My skin is more even, I have less acne, and my skin holds moisture much better than before I began using this product.</li>
    <li> after I started using this product, i didn&#x27;t need to use foundation and my skin looks healthy and the pores somehow seem to close up.</li>
    <li> Within two weeks, my skin tone was more even, skin was softer, blemishes non-existent.  LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!! My skin is brighter, healthy looking and vibrant.  I love it!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had painful cystic acne for 20 years and this is THE FIRST cream that I&#x27;ve used that doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out further.(I&#x27;ve tried the expensive department store brands, the cheapo drug store brands and the very expensive creams from my dermatologist.) My skin loves it. It even reduced the irritation and peeling caused by the Retin-A Gel that I have to use. It smells nice, it&#x27;s a great moisturizer, my skin looks great and I am one happy woman!!!</li>
    <li> This compound works well on smooth surfaces, such as one&#x27;s upper cheekbones, but it fails completely for areas such as elbows that have permanent wrinkles.  This is a long-term treatment -- it&#x27;s not a quick fix like Preparation H, which can remove (via shrinking the tissues) eye wrinkles quickly but just for a short time.  Anew Alternative requires a full commitment for the long haul, if you are to achieve the results you want.</li>
    <li> I too have a rash and it seems to be getting worse and I have stopped the product 5 days a go.  I used this product nightly for a month. Only now I realize that I had cold like sympthoms that were the first signs of the allergy.  I could not get rid of the cold.  Well then so suddenly my face started to itch and then I noticed bumps on the sides of my cheeks.  I looked in the mirror and I saw the bumps.  By morning my whole face was swollen, my eyes, lips and everything burned.  I looked like I was stung by bees.  Now I have purplish red bumps that are all over my cheeks and spreading to under my eyes.  I am on predisone, cotisone creams,antibiotics and Zyrtec (antihistimine).  One dr (I have seen 3) told me it would take up to 3 weeks. Anyone that has experiences this please email me at Crrizzz@aol.com.  I need some hope this will go away.</li>
    <li> Oh my GosH!!!!!  I used this cream for about one month and woke up one day with bumps all over my face!!!  Just as others had described!  Very itchy, red and very swollen.  Been to the doctor.  On zertek and a face cortizone.</li>
    <li> Followed directions, started with clean face. Applied ANEW ALTERNATIVE to face and neck area. The following morning I woke up SWOLLEN AND RASHED. My skin is not sensative but whatever is in this product is detrimental to skin. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell any difference since I have started using this product about 1 month ago.</li>
    <li> If I could rate this product at less than zero, I would.  Unfortunately the rating system doesn&#x27;t allow for negataive numbers!  I used it every other night for less than a week and developed a terrible allergic reaction in the form of a red bumpy rash.  The rash is everywhere where I used the product (Avon Alternative Intensive Age Treatment).    Don&#x27;t use this product until you&#x27;ve done a patch test.  Based on the reviews I&#x27;ve read, I would continue the patch test for at least a month before using it on face or neck.  Better safe than sorry!</li>
    <li> I use this product as directed on my face and neck at night. It feels wonderful on the skin! I&#x27;ve been using this product since it was introduced last year (2005) and feel it has helped improve the quality and appearance of my skin. I even love how it smells~~ herbal/natural! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin, however I have not had a negative experience with the Anew Alternative. I&#x27;m sorry to hear that others have had a reaction to this product.</li>
    <li> As a 50+ gal w/very sensitive skin I&#x27;m always on the lookout for products using new technology that really work.  This product does a great job making skin brighter and glowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use a little, warm it up on your fingertips and apply.  Because the new technology breaks down some of the cellular debris, make sure you wash your face w/water afterwards and don&#x27;t let your skin go out w/some coverage.  Enjoy your blooming skin this spring.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that is perfect in combination with the Alternative Day with spf.  That saves smearing greasy sunscreen on your face.  The night version smells a bit like coffee to me (in a good way) and is very thick. It tingles a bit when applied.  &lt;br /&gt;It is the only cream I have found (and have tried many!) that will get rid of persistant red dry blotches that I get on my face. So for that alone I give it top marks.   &lt;br /&gt;The split eye cream (Clinical Eye lift) is also an excellent product.  I tried that in the Avon Maven trials and was worried when I finished the trial that the product would not be out soon enough!  The best part about that product is that it makes your eyes look younger and brighter with a couple weeks use.</li>
    <li> Used the product for several weeks and everything was going fine.  Had stopped using it daily on face because skin was looking red. but continued use on neck and chest.  Broke out in a horrible rash on chest and neck after several weeks of use.  Rash is in it&#x27;s 4th day and no OTC had worked.  Am calling my Dr. today.  Read another&#x27;s review refering to the same type of rash.  Would love to know what in the product is causing this reaction.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for my dark circles since 20 days. It works great I have seen my dark circle fade already.</li>
    <li> It did irriate my skin at first, but I have sensitive skin, so everything does.  I ignored it and kept using it anyway.  Now my skin has quit reacting to it, and all of my crow&#x27;s feet, laugh lines, and other wrinkles are gone.  I use it once a day.  When my skin was getting burned, then I would just skip a day or two between applications.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I have tried several products and this one is the best so far.  I love the way my skin feels after I put this on.  It will sting just a little if you have any open areas on the skin, but the glow I get!  I hate that the others have had a reaction, but for me, I am a repeat user.  I am waiting for my next jar to arrive. My skin just seems to plump and glow after applying.</li>
    <li> My friend who sells Avon, gave me a sample of the Anew Alternative Intensive Age Treatment.  Let me add that I&#x27;m 26 and figured that a free sample of moisturizer couldn&#x27;t hurt anyone.  Well, I used the product for one night (Saturday) and by Monday morning, I woke up to find a rash on both checks that is red and blotchy and feels like a scab.  I didn&#x27;t make such a big deal out of it, but it is now itchy.  I&#x27;m a little worried after reading the other reviews.  I am so glad that I only used this product one time.  Shame on Avon for putting out a product that has such negative side effects on many people.</li>
    <li> I do not have sensitive skin, so I ignored the reviews here that mentioned skin irritation. I used it once a day. Day One, it itched until absorbed by my skin. No big deal, I can live with that. Day Two, more itching, a little more bothersome. Skipped a night. Day Four (treatment #3), I had to wash it off my face within 10 minutes - it itched insanely! Skipped two nights. Tonight (Day Seven, but treatment #4) it *burned*, it has been off my skin for 30 minutes now and it feels like I have a sunburn. I couldn&#x27;t wash it off fast enough. I feel sorry for those with sensitive skin! I&#x27;ll think twice before using another Avon product. I used to use Guerlain, maybe you do get what you pay for after all.</li>
    <li> I used this product for 2 weeks and loved the results.  One night I broke out in a rash on my face with the similar description as others have experienced.  It is extremely itchy on my chin, around my mouth and on cheeks.  There are red blotches and pimples with white heads.  I suspected this product caused the reaction since I don&#x27;t have any food allergies, but after reading the other reviews I am certain it was the cream.  This is day 5 and I am taking Benadryl as my doctor advised and using hydrocortisone cream.  The itching has stopped and swelling and redness has improved, but my skin looks a mess.  Glad I&#x27;m not the only one.  The rash broke out immediately after I took Naproxen (like Aleve), an anti-inflammatory/pain reliever.  Did anyone else take a pill like this?</li>
    <li> I purchased Anew Alternative because I received a sample from my representative. I didn&#x27;t have problems for the first 2 weeks, then I woke up one morning with a severe rash all over my face. By the next day, the rash was worse. I looked as if I&#x27;d been stung by bees, and had red welts everywhere the product had been applied. The swelling and itching got worse as the day passed, and I ended up in an Urgent Care clinic. I was given a prescription for Prednisone. Guess I&#x27;ll go back to the Estee Lauder facial product I had used for years w/out a problem. It&#x27;s worth the extra expense!!!!!!!</li>
