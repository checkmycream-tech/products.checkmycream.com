      <li>I found the Hollywood fashion tape sticks fairly well to skin, but poorly to many fabrics.</li>
      <li>good for many purposes</li>

      <li>For ladies who live in South Florida or anywhere, Hollywood Fashion Tape is a girl&#x27;s best friend.  </li>

      <li>I discovered this amazing product in a boutique but haven&#x27;t been able to find them since.</li>
      <li>This was has worked the best so far.</li>

      <li>Hollywood tape is perfect for a night out for me in a great top that just needs a little help staying put.  </li>

      <li>I love how easily and effectively they apply as well.</li>

      <li>There are so many uses for it.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this and always have some  </li>

      <li>They work like magic and have saved me from many embarrassing wardrobe snafus.</li>
      <li>I love this tape.</li>
      <li>They can stick fabric to skin or much better- fabric to fabric.</li>
      <li>I use it mostly to hold my tops in place on my shoulders and for modesty.  </li>
      <li>i use this more to hem my pants so i can wear them with heels or flats.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> don&#x27;t stick well except with very light fabrics, didn&#x27;t meet expectations and now not even bothering to use them.</li>
    <li> Competitors have products with same quality but much cheaper and you get a lot more of their product in regards to quantity</li>
    <li> No more central boob :-). Everything stays in place. Long-lasting.</li>
    <li> Love these Hollywood Tapes.  Couldn&#x27;t dress without them.</li>
    <li> Usefull as usual. to keep the tie aligned, Shirts Collar, some shirts have a long space from the Last Button and the End of the Shirt. i use this to solve that problem.</li>
    <li> I used these as stocking stuffers and kept one for myself.  Great item to have on hand... has many uses.</li>
    <li> So cute, works very well</li>
    <li> I love this item it keeps my bra straps from sliding down, my socks in place (no more bunching down my toes) my button shirt from gaping.And it last all day.  I actually cut the strips in half so I get twice the amount. Its a must have.  Just make sure ur skin is clean of lotion or oils b4 applying directly on the skin.</li>
    <li> I slope  to the left due to scoliosis - these are a realGIFT!! I use one in my bare left shoulder 2 keep bra strap from sliding off. Then maybe one on shoulder near neck to keep silk or lite weight blouse in place. Also have used on blouse to keep blazer in place on left. No pesky hiking up of straps, rearranging blouses or jackets any more . I keep a pkg in purse, glove comp. , kitchen. Such a relief after years of always hiking up clothing Now I can relax that side of my body. Kudos to inventor!</li>
    <li> works well to secure between buttons</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work very well for my cotton/poly blouses. Still popped open. And won&#x27;t restick well of course once that happens. Nice idea though.</li>
    <li> Yep, it&#x27;s double-sided, rubbery tape.&lt;br /&gt;It is not as strong as I was hoping, the stickiness wears off through the night, &amp; it irritates my skin despite being hypoallergenic.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Got the order promptly!</li>
    <li> A friend at work told me about Hollywood Tape so I had to try it.  It truly is amazing.  Easy to use, easy to remove, but HOLDS!  Great for keeping in place clothing that does not want to cooperate.</li>
    <li> Love these tapes.  Vendor has them at the right price.  Has totally eliminated my need for pins to make the folds of a blouse lay just right.  Also makes a great hem tape for that time when your heal rips out just enough for a section of the hem to sag.  Something every woman needs in her cosmetic bag.  These tins are small but hold a lot.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a lightweight solution for gaps, these are great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re full figured and trying to keep everything together in a low cut bra, expect to replace hourly.</li>
    <li> love these strips, but there are others much cheaper and these little containers are not that easy to open, plus they&#x27;re even a little big for me and my purse</li>
    <li> i use this more to hem my pants so i can wear them with heels or flats. works just great!</li>
    <li> My cousin introduced this product to me and I found it a life saver when it came to putting (&amp; keeping) my blouse/dress neckline in place.</li>
    <li> This double-sided tape is fantastic. It works really well between buttons on my shirts which tend to gap because I&#x27;m busty. I&#x27;ve used it to save a hem that came undone and to keep a wrap top from showing too much cleavage. The little container is genius so I always have it with me and often find myself giving tape out to friends, family and coworkers. One tip I have is to cut a bunch of them in half and keep those at the ready in the case. That&#x27;s the size I happen to use the most. This multi-pack is also wonderful and these make great little gifts.</li>
    <li> I tried using normal double sided sticky tape but they all failed in keeping pieces of clothing in place.  These are great little strips with staying power. It helps in situations where my shirt gaps or my cardigans won&#x27;t stay in place.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Hollywood Fashion Tape for years. This was a great deal and I love the smaller packaging. It makes it much easier to carry in my purse for fashion emergencies!</li>
    <li> very sticky last all day ...shut down the gap!</li>
    <li> These are a life saver.  I use them all the time, when wearing cowl necks, to hide bra straps and when wearing tank tops.</li>
    <li> These clothing tapes are the best I have found to date.  The previous brand I&#x27;d bought was not only a pain to use, but didn&#x27;t hold all that well either.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND HOLLYWOOD&#x27;S FASHION TAPE.  You will not be disappointed when you use them!</li>
    <li> stays on all night! i use it for dresses when i go out (backless) or front low cut where i dont want to bend over and let people see my titties</li>
    <li> This tape holds all day long.  If you buy a cheaper brand, the bond is not that strong and it will not stay put like this tape does.  Highly recommend keeping this on hand always.  The small travel size case also fits in your purse nicely.  Will buy again when I run out.</li>
    <li> Once stuck, doesn&#x27;t unstick. But be sure to know exactly where you want it stuck bc it loses its stickiness if you adjust by peeling off and on, even if you do it once. Love the individual case they come in. Great for travel.</li>
    <li> I love this double sided tape. I have multiple uses for it and it has yet to fail me.  I would highly recommend this product!!!!!</li>
    <li> Every woman should have this in their beauty arsenal. It&#x27;s perfect for making sure there are no gaps between buttons and bras straps but pick out</li>
    <li> Been using Hollywood Tape for years to keep shoulders of garments from slipping down and bra showing.  Also have used for years holding &#x27;between button&#x27; areas closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great invention and easy to use.  Always have in my purse/suitcase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried other brands and none are better than this brand.  Plus I love the cute little tins and use for pills, tiny items, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Have even painted them to distinguish them when traveling or storing small items.</li>
    <li> I absolutely would be lost without these handy strips. I&#x27;ve used them for several years and give them as little gifts for the holidays to other ladies. Of course they are great for those gaps in your button up shirts, but I&#x27;ve also used them for repairing hems when I&#x27;m not anywhere near a needle and thread,and even on a new pair of shoes that had slippery heels.</li>
    <li> This product arrived on time and it wonderful, just like every other Hollywood tape I have purchased.  The four pack is great value for money.</li>
    <li> Have been using these for years. Would not be without.</li>
    <li> I love these and use them all the time to keep my bra from showing. I do think they could put them in a bigger box so you don&#x27;t have as many boxes but they are cute little boxes. I think this product is the BOMB and I couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> Best thing since sliced bread. Keeps straps and shoulders of shirts in place.&lt;br /&gt;Gave as stocking stuffer for female family members.</li>
    <li> I love to use this tape to hold items in place, such as straps or scarves.  Need to keep it where originally placed, as it doesn&#x27;t work well when repositioned.</li>
    <li> I love this fashion tape!  I use it mostly to hold my tops in place on my shoulders and for modesty.  This tape is a must have to hold dresses in place ie: straps on shoulders and across bustline, etc.  it holds all day and then some.</li>
    <li> I gave these to my bridesmaids are part of the gift we put together. I havent used them to keep anything in place on my skin but they work fantastic for missing buttons and hems that have fallen out. Great to have in your purse for little emergencies.</li>
    <li> We use this product to aid in keeping my daughters&#x27; competition dance costume in place.  We have used another brand and it failed.  These have not let us down.</li>
    <li> This brand of tape is excellent.  I use it a lot and not just for clothes.  I have also used on curtains where the hem fell down.  Very satisfieed and will definitely purchase this again and again and again!</li>
    <li> Brought this for work keep a pack in my desk and it cimes in handy! Heavy materials such as Jeans can be a challenge but overall I&#x27;m pleased</li>
    <li> This double sided clothing tape works fabulously -- keeps your clothes where they should be, keeps your gaps from gaping open and you don&#x27;t even know you&#x27;re using it!  Arrived quickly, too!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this and always have some  on hand it&#x27;s perfect for keeping straps in place</li>
    <li> Great to have a box of these around to keep it all together.  Love the convenience of the tape instead of tugging and pulling usually at the opening of a blouse or between two buttons that should have been three.</li>
    <li> I had been having a problem recently with button down collared shirts gapping near my breasts.  As I was doing a search online to find a remedy I came across this product.  I made an order and I loved it!  The fashion tape works well and lasts all day...from morning to end of work day!  What is great too is that it doesn&#x27;t leave any sticky residue on your shirt when you take it off.  This product turned out to be a great buy and made some of my unwearable button down shirts wearable again!  Update:  two years later, I&#x27;m still using hollywood fashion tape for my button down collared shirts</li>
    <li> I find this item works very well.  I had a friend tell me about the tape and the first time I bought it at a local store, I paid a lot more for it.  I have trouble with my bra straps falling off my shoulders and  it works great to hold the straps were they belong.  Love this item.</li>
    <li> I use these strips for more than just hems or keeping blouse closed.  I used them on curtains and other things around the house.  They hold great and virtually invisible.</li>
    <li> I have a tattoo that should not be seen at work. I use the tape to help hold my shirt in place to cover the tattoo up. The tape lasts all day, is easy to remove from skin at night and doesn&#x27;t ruin my clothes. I love it and will deffinately buy more when I run out.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this fashion tape for years.  I use it to hem pants and skirts (and it stays, wash after wash, amazingly), to anchor a too-low v neck top, to hold my lightweight satin roge (that came with no hooks) together, to hem cuffs and any number of things.  I pack some in my travel case so they are there for whatever need I might have.  When you need to sew something down but a stitch would show, these are excellent.  They are versatile and once they&#x27;re on the fabric, they hold.  I won&#x27;t be without them!!</li>
    <li> I have limited use with one arm and it make them little hard to use... But once I get it on the work great..</li>
    <li> Love these things they work great.</li>
    <li> Love these tapes; they really work!  I am putting in stockings this year for all the girls in my family!</li>
    <li> They work!  Sounds like a great start to me.  Have had other brands in the past and have not been as pleased.</li>
    <li> I read great reviews about this tape so I decided to buy. Well twice I went out I have placed this on my skin and both times I had to keep pressing the nylon fabric on my dress against my skin. Now, my friend used it to keep her blouse buttoned up between her buttons and it worked well without coming undone.</li>
    <li> Save my day... used this for my dress since it&#x27;s low cut in the front... so happy i dance all night...don&#x27;t have to worry about my brest all over the place... it&#x27;s almost the same like double side tape but little bit thicker... for emergency u can used doubles side tape I think it would work the same...</li>
    <li> I love these!  Read about them on yahoo and found them on Amazon.  Liked them so much that I bought more to share with my friends!  I keep one at the office, one in my purse and one at home.  Very handy!</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t stay.  They are very hard to put on. . Seems like they take longer to put on than for them to come off. Wish I hadn&#x27;t ordered so much.</li>
    <li> This product is good but at times the tape loosens causing the fabric to wrinkle.  I wish it had more adhesive to hold heavier fabrics but the benefit to having this product is I got the four pack so I have plenty of tape for replacement.</li>
    <li> This is a must-have! Easy to apply, easily removed before washing your garment, and keeps whatever you stick it to in place! No worries about gapping between buttons or gaping necklines for me. The cute little carry tin slips into a purse pocket or desk drawer &amp;#34;just in case&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Hollywood Fashion Tape is great!  I use it almost every day.  It hides your bra staps, which makes your outfit neat looking.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love these things I use them almost daily to keep my shirts in place so they don&#x27;t slide forward and expose things.  Use them to keep my shirts from gaping.  love them.</li>
    <li> I chose to wear this for my wedding day and was very disappointed, it was supposed to keep the straps of my dress in place but a few hours into the wedding people were pointing out my shiny strips affixed to my skin that had been exposed :(</li>
    <li> These work fantastically! I love how easily and effectively they apply as well.</li>
    <li> these work very well.</li>
    <li> These strips are great stuff.  They corral wandering bra straps and put an end to the gaps that sometimes occur in a blouse placket.</li>
    <li> I use the tape to keep clothing in place in order to prevent certain \\&quot;wardrobe malfunctions\\&quot;.  It works perfectly and does not lose its staying power throughout the day.  It will not harm your skin and is easily removeable from your skin and from clothing without leaving behind a sticky residue.  I highly recommend this product for all your wardrobe malfunction-prevention needs!</li>
    <li> I use these for fixing annoying things like sling-backs that won&#x27;t stay up, bra straps that won&#x27;t stay hidden, collars that won&#x27;t stay up or down. The small tins are great for storage and I love to share the additional packs with family and friends. Great stocking stuffer!</li>
    <li> very good for every woman to have in her purse&lt;br /&gt;very useful for blouse betwwen the buttons or to put the scrf in place</li>
    <li> This stuff really works!  I use it often.</li>
    <li> Wonderful!!! I loved it!!! It really fixes at clothes and your skin! It makes you feel comfortable and secure all day long.</li>
    <li> I love this tape. There are so many uses for it.</li>
    <li> LOVE these! I use mainly for help with neckline security. Some of my soft blouses tend to slip and not stay &amp;#34;centered&amp;#34; - with my Fashion tape, I don&#x27;t have to worry! I also use it to prevent button &amp;#34;gaps&amp;#34; and to keep scarves in place. I&#x27;m glad amazon carries them and appreciate them coming in 4 packs.</li>
    <li> I use this to stick bra pads to my skin so I don&#x27;t have to wear a full bra. two strips on each. Works!</li>
    <li> For ladies who live in South Florida or anywhere, Hollywood Fashion Tape is a girl&#x27;s best friend.  Hate those annoying bra straps showing when you wear a tank top?  Slap on a strip of HFT and that strap isn&#x27;t going anywhere.  Have a low cut blouse that opens just a bit too much at the cleavage?  Cut a smaller piece off the pre-cut strips and stick it right between the gap and you&#x27;ll stay closed all day.  They are very sticky, and also important, they are stretchy, which means they stay put even when you move about.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how I ever got along without this stuff.  I&#x27;m a girl with generous curves and this tape keeps the gaps between buttons closed, keeps shrugs and sweaters exactly where I want them, quick-fixes hemlines, keeps empire waisted knit tops from creeping up over my ample bosom during the day, man...seriously.  Whew.</li>
    <li> I discovered this amazing product in a boutique but haven&#x27;t been able to find them since. They are an essential! They are easy to use and stronger than they look. I&#x27;ve used them for shirts, dresses, belts, etc. I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> This is a great product to carry with you.  The carrying case is wonderful, you don&#x27;t have to worry about anything getting into the tape.  Really good for hems.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product.  Use them to keep cardigans from flying open all the time.  I give them as stocking stuffers</li>
    <li> I gave this out at Christmas so that my friends would not have wardrobe malfunctions.  Comes in very handy and works great/</li>
    <li> love love this stuff.....works like a dream.</li>
    <li> Hollywood tape is perfect for a night out for me in a great top that just needs a little help staying put.  Or even for my daughter who needs some help hiding her newly acquired bra straps...</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! No more errant straps or floppy shoulders. These are just the best for &amp;#34;avoiding wardrobe&amp;#34; malfunctions!</li>
    <li> Does as expected. Got the 4 pack and gave my friends a gift which made them very happy.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected great product</li>
    <li> good for many purposes</li>
    <li> always try to keep a supply on hand. have not used anything else since I have started using these strap holders.</li>
    <li> This is just what was needed to hold dress tops in place.  The individual pink containers are perfect for bridesmaid gifts!</li>
    <li> Fashion tape is a must have item and this is the best brand I&#x27;ve used. Whether it&#x27;s keeping button downs from gaping, keeping straps in place or a neckline just so, these work beautifully. They can stick fabric to skin or much better- fabric to fabric. Some have even made it through the wash stick in tact. You&#x27;ll wonder how you ever lived without it. I&#x27;ve tried other tapes but most of them didn&#x27;t work well. This was has worked the best so far. Keep one of the little tins in your purse and at some point you or a friend will be really glad you had it. No you cannot use scotch double sided tape in the same way, at all.</li>
    <li> I have a sweater twin set and have successfully attached the tank to the sweater and it stays put the entire day.  Very ingenious and there is no residue when the strips are removed.</li>
    <li> I just do not know what I would do without these fashion tapes.  For years and years I had pined my bra to my clothing to keep the strap from showing.  These work very well.</li>
    <li> These aren&#x27;t just for holding up clothes so busts and bras don&#x27;t show, they are great for keeping those annoying belt tabs held down for a nice &amp;#34;put together&amp;#34; look too. I really like the travel packs because strips are a thinner width than the ones that come in a tape dispenser and much handier for keeping a few in my comestic bag in my purse and carry-on. The travel tins are hard to find in dress stores (well, impossible, really) and four pack made them super affordable too! Thank you Amazon. :-)</li>
    <li> DO YOU HAVE A SHIRT THAT GAPS OR PLUGS TO LOW FOR WORK. THESE WORK GREAT AND ARE EASY TO USE. IT TAKE A LITTLE PRACTICE TO GET THEM POSITIONED RIGHT, BUT AFTER THAT THEY ARE AMAZING</li>
    <li> I expected this product to be a God send given all of the reviews I saw. I got the tape because I had to wear a strapless dress for a wedding so I wanted to hold my dress up and subsequently hide some unsightly arm fat (eek!). It works, sort of. I had to go through a couple pieces before I was finally taped in and ready to go. After about an hour or so, the tape loses is stickiness so I had to keep reapplying. Also, another issue is that when I went to take the tape off at the end of the night, the skin where the tape was had become blotchy, red and irritated. I expected some irritation, but it was pretty bad. All in all, it gets the job done, but could be better.</li>
    <li> Saw this advertised on a shopping channel. Bought my first set there and have been using it ever since. Really works! Definitely love the four pack...to be divided out between daughters!</li>
    <li> Hollywood fashion tape works amazing</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I ran out of Topstick wig tape (which I use for clothing, not for wigs). It pales by comparison. I will go back to buying Topstick, or Fashion fix (both made by Vapon). I found the Hollywood fashion tape sticks fairly well to skin, but poorly to many fabrics. I usually have to reapply new strips several times throughout the day. Good for keeping bra straps from shifting, because there&#x27;s already downward pressure. Not so great for keeping low cut shirts or sweaters in place, etc.</li>
    <li> This tape is great and super convenient since the strips are pre cut . I use it to tape my low cut tank tops to my bra to avoid the occasional bra slip. Works awesome and I don&#x27;t have to worry about everyone seeing my bra. They sell single tins of this stuff at Old Navy and Ulta, but at 10$ for a single pack. This is a way better deal and will last a while.</li>
    <li> Works great.  No worries about my clothing moving.</li>
    <li> These are great for short stints. Don&#x27;t work long term but will do in a pinch. I use them for a lot of different things. Good buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with these things. They are the best and the tape really stays in place!</li>
    <li> No other tape I&#x27;ve found works as well as this to prevent straps from showing, etc.  I just wish the company would become more environmentally smart and use paper box or bag instead of the metal boxes.  It would be cheaper to produce and ship, but is anyone listening to me?</li>
    <li> Have used these many times.  They work very well and are easy to use.  Great time saver when you don&#x27;t have time to sew.</li>
    <li> Cannot live without this stuff!  Hem repair, hiding bra straps, keeping necklines where I want them...can&#x27;t beat it.  I usually find that half of a strip is plenty.  Keep a few strips in your wallet!</li>
    <li> Works great if u don&#x27;t sweat!</li>
    <li> My wife has been using Hollywood Fashion Tape almost every day for several years, which is why I buy multiple four-pack strips for her when she runs low. To her, this is an essential accessory to her fashion routine. If she&#x27;s happy with the product, I am happy with the product...the all wise husband!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Everything from putting in shoulder pads, taping lapels in place, etc.  Can&#x27;t get dressed without it.</li>
    <li> These thing are amazing! This four pack will last a long time. It is perfect for making sure your clothes don&#x27;t move and expose something you don&#x27;t want exposed, or to save yourself from having to readjust your clothes constantly. I think every woman should have these.</li>
    <li> This is some of the strongest wardrobe tape I have ever used. Whether you need to stick fabric to your skin or just another piece of clothing, it stays all day long. The little tin containers are perfect for on the go. Get this tape and never have an embarrassing wardrobe malfunction again! Keep it classy ladies:)</li>
    <li> This is most perfect for woman who wants to wear really loose dresses.</li>
    <li> Easy to get the backing off, I keep these in my purse for those moments when a hem falls, a shirt gapes, or I realize the plunging neckline is a little too plungey for my liking.  They are easy to cut to make them fit the area or shape needed.  Definitely a good product to keep in the emergency sewing kit.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a costume, figuring it&#x27;d help keep parts of my costume down to my skin so it wouldn&#x27;t be too revealing. I also hoped it&#x27;d keep my stockings up. It didn&#x27;t do much but tug on my skin for a few moments, then pull away from the tape. This left the tape on my skin, and the costume either being too revealing, or the stockings falling down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up going around my legs twice with it and pressed with a lot of pressure. It helped for 2 minutes, tops. After that it fell down, and I was left with my stockings under my knees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe if it was a shirt that had a bit of gaping it&#x27;d be useful but right now I have a ton of these strips that don&#x27;t help.</li>
    <li> This is The most AWESOME product!!! I&#x27;m more excited that they carry ALL the items in this brand!! Your life will change once you use the Double-Sided tape for the 1st time!!! I can&#x27;t imagine wearing a scarf without this product!! Sooo thin but sooo strong!!! I wanted a heavy silk scarf to stay flipped across my shoulder all of my 9 hr work day and by the end of that shift, I had to PEEL it Off, because the tape was still so secure! LOVE the Hem Tape as well, and the Sweater Brush to wipe away piling is FAB!! Will tell ALLL my gal pals about you!!!</li>
    <li> I use this to tape strapless dresses to my bra or to temporarily hem up pants. Very tight hold, works great! Sometimes leaves a little residue when you pull it off but it has always washed off in the washing machine. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for three years and I love it. I can wear button down, off the shoulder, and plunging neckline shirts without worrying about flashing anyone. It also doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on my clothes. A must have for anyone&#x27;s wardrobe.</li>
    <li> The tape sticks to any kind of fabric and stays put. Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> Finally a solution to slipping straps. . . can be used for other purposes. . . Love this product</li>
    <li> The wife uses these all the time and shares with friends to try out. This must be the 3rd batch I&#x27;ve ordered up.</li>
    <li> Works like it is supposed to work. It&#x27;s the only clothing tape to buy. I&#x27;ve purchased other clothing to skin type tapes on amazon and I&#x27;ve been sorely let down. This tape works and does not stop nor does it come apart or unstuck. It&#x27;s the best !!!</li>
    <li> Works great. Service was excellent</li>
    <li> Use it all the time..for many wardrobe quick fixes.  ...a must keep / have item</li>
    <li> This tape really works; the only thing I hate is that you cannot buy it for less (the cost of production must be few cents...)</li>
    <li> I have a problem with straps constantly moving around and needed something that really worked keeping the straps in place. These clothing tapes are perfect, stay attached, and can be removed easily. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Absolutely essential. I have one container in my brief bag, one in my sponge bag, one in my car and another in my dek. I even keep a couple of strips in my wallet. Loose hem, low cut blouse, slip showing, this works. Doesn&#x27;t hurt fabric or irritate skin. Lasts as long as you need it too.</li>
    <li> I hate it when my blouses pucker open between buttons so I use these tapes and they work well.  I also use them if I have a blouse that shows my bra straps, I put the tape on the blouse where the stap is and no worry.</li>
    <li> I am a corporate woman and am required to wear business suits often. When wearing collared button down shirts I use these fashion tape strips in between each button to keep the shirt tightly closed all the way down the button line. They work like magic and have saved me from many embarrassing wardrobe snafus. I never wear a button down without these fashion strips!!</li>
