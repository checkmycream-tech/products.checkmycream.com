      <li>I LOVE this color nail polish.  </li>
      <li>Love OPI and I love this color.</li>
      <li>i bought this from my aunt, and i absolutely love this color :) its not overpowering or anything , unless you make it that way by adding like 50 coats.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still a cute color.</li>
      <li>and i am so glad i got this one</li>
      <li>Excellent choice to add to my blue collection.</li>
      <li>I received so many compliments and questions about what color I was wearing and where i purchased it.</li>
      <li>Looks really great over another polish, but not as much by itself.</li>
      <li>Looking at my nails holistically, they are more of a deeper bluish-purple color.</li>
      <li>I love the glitter of this polish.  </li>
      <li>I HAVE BOUGHT BETTER GLITTER.</li>
      <li>Originally bought this for my daughter, but I love it!</li>
      <li>more nail polish remover</li>
      <li>more nail polish remover...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m rough on my nails so this is quite impressive.</li>
      <li>It took three coats of top coat to feel smooth.</li>
      <li>its nice to wear if youre going to a party or a fun get together.</li>
      <li>I thought the color was going to be exactly like the picture, but its more of a top coat or a color to add to a lighter color.</li>
      <li>do not use acetone polish except on your own natural nail very important</li>
      <li>but if you are creative enough, I think you&#x27;ll be able to get a nice outcome with it.</li>
      <li>but i will enjoy the mini</li>
      <li>U kind of have to pack it on to get the color other wise</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a gorgeous DARK blue polish, this would be perfect.</li>
      <li>It looked great, was very easy to apply, dried fairly quickly, didn&#x27;t smudge, and under halogen lighting it sparkles and shimmers.  </li>
      <li>Might work as a good top coat for other colors but alone</li>
      <li>I think it may be the lighting that makes the nails look bright blue in the picture.</li>
      <li>It came in one piece!This polish is the (Bright Blue)</li>
      <li>i will not buy the full sized bottle</li>
      <li>My order arrived quickly and was wrapped in bubble wrap.</li>
      <li>This is super transparent.</li>
      <li>I put it on over fuchsia polish and it looks pretty fabulous.</li>
      <li>I like to put it over plain nail color for a beautiful splash of sparkle</li>
      <li>but  it was fun for a weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I think there to were three dollars well worth it you can use them over and over again</li>
      <li>No amount of sparkle is worth that</li>
      <li>TONS of glitter, which is nice in that I didn&#x27;t have to do multiple coats to get the effect I wanted.</li>
      <li>Have fun.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how many coats this lady used but even after three coats the result is still almost clear.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really fun and can be worn by itself or layered over another color.  </li>
      <li>I did not expect it to be any more than just a light blue shade with some glitter.</li>
      <li>Worth the difficulty of removal for beauty.</li>
      <li>it will wipe right off.</li>
      <li>Still, I thought the color came out pretty nice especially after I slapped on some snowflake nail decals to get a wintery theme going.</li>
      <li>Definitely not as bright as shown, it appears to be more of a top coat, I&#x27;ll probably have a buy a bright blue</li>
      <li>Because of the low price, (which I did love), it isn&#x27;t worth returning.  </li>
      <li>This is pretty</li>
      <li>It looks pretty in the photo</li>
      <li>Has more of a purple look than blue without that silver nail polish underneath.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is really pretty nail polish.</li>
      <li>if I  put it on top of a blue or teal .</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not one for glitter, but this one caught my eye because it wasn&#x27;t one of those colors that are so bright that they look childish.  </li>
      <li>I first tried this nail polish from a friend and wanted one for myself.</li>
      <li>Pretty in the bottle but only OK on your fingers.</li>
      <li>Soooooo much glitter!</li>
      <li>But the picture shown for this item makes it look more blue than it really is.  </li>
      <li>I used a light blue underneath to make it look more blue.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll just look much more carefully and read the reviews first.</li>
      <li>Such a beautiful color I bought a few of these nail polishes</li>
      <li>This is EXACTLY what I wanted and was just like my friends except mine was BRAND NEW!</li>
      <li>It can take some effort to remove it depending on what nail polish remover you use, I had a lot of trouble using the really cheap stuff, but with some cotton and a Chanel nail polish remover it was easy and fast.</li>
      <li>and that has a whole you put your finger through</li>
      <li>haha.</li>
      <li>and they are much easier to do than the foil in my opinion .</li>
      <li>but when you put it on, it looks more clear than blue</li>
      <li>second of all, the removal comments make no sense to me because as I said in my review for Teenage Dream, I have problems with the fact that BOTH of these colors peel right off my nails much too easily.</li>
      <li>but they need to sell it with its own sandblaster or at least make a nail polish remover strong enough to take it</li>
      <li>I ordered this item expecting it to be a fun Caribbean blue shade.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I loooovve it!!!! It so preety and i love glitter polish! U kind of have to pack it on to get the color other wise it will just look like a glittery clear but i still love it! I added some baby blue rhinestones afterwards and it looked beautiful!</li>
    <li> I thought the color was going to be exactly like the picture, but its more of a top coat or a color to add to a lighter color. It&#x27;s still a cute color.</li>
    <li> i thought this would be nicely pigmented like it is in the picture. but its not. the color is there. it shows, but not like in that picture. i will not buy the full sized bottle but i will enjoy the mini</li>
    <li> Ordered Saturday night, received today (Monday) Can&#x27;t wait to try this gorgeous color!!! Can&#x27;t be bad. Never met an OPI I didn&#x27;t like!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very versatile nail polish, since with one or two coats you get a shimmery blue transparent layer over a base of any other color, or you can use three or more coats and get the really bright blue, super-sparkly effect you see on the picture (it looks the same). I&#x27;ve used it in both ways and really love it. It can take some effort to remove it depending on what nail polish remover you use, I had a lot of trouble using the really cheap stuff, but with some cotton and a Chanel nail polish remover it was easy and fast.</li>
    <li> Need  to use a blue or related color for the base to get a nice, deep color.  Using it alone will give you a delicate sparkle of color.</li>
    <li> pretty color but very sheer I like it more if I  put it on top of a blue or teal . Got  to my door very quickly!</li>
    <li> My order arrived quickly and was wrapped in bubble wrap. As for the color, its a jelly based formula so let the coat dry a little before applying the next coat. It&#x27;s sheer but I like it. The glitter is cut into different shapes and sizes. If you want an opaque blue, try layering Last Friday Night over China Glaze&#x27;s blue frostbite. That combo earns compliments.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item expecting it to be a fun Caribbean blue shade.  What I received was a blue glittery shade.  Maybe I didn&#x27;t look at the image close enough, but this is not at all what I was looking for.  I don&#x27;t mind slightly glittery colors now and then, they can be fun, but this isn&#x27;t what I thought I was buying.  Because of the low price, (which I did love), it isn&#x27;t worth returning.  I guess it will just be something that I can give to one of my young nieces.  Maybe if the picture was larger I wouldn&#x27;t have made this mistake.  Hopefully this review will help someone who thought the same as I did, and they won&#x27;t make the same mistake.  I gave this shade 2 stars because it was priced well and I love OPI!  Otherwise it would have received 1 star only because I couldn&#x27;t give it 0 stars.  I also just read some reviews stating that it is extremely hard to get off.  Definitely not for someone that has weaker nails like mine are.  Oh well.  This isn&#x27;t going to stop me from ordering more OPI though!  I&#x27;ll just look much more carefully and read the reviews first.</li>
    <li> For some reason I thought that this would be a solid blue shade, but instead it is sheer with the most incredible little rainbow of round glitters. I put it on over fuchsia polish and it looks pretty fabulous.</li>
    <li> The polish pictured does not match the outcome. I don&#x27;t know how many coats this lady used but even after three coats the result is still almost clear. I was very excited about this color but am severely disappointed. Might work as a good top coat for other colors but alone is it not much.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve waited 3 months for this to come out and was sadly disappointed. When you paint your nails it looks nothing like what is in the bottle. It looks clear with gliiter in it. I&#x27;ve bought the alice in wonderland gliiter nail polish and it worked great. I recommened it if you plan on using black shatter over it but difinately not by itself.</li>
    <li> It looks pretty in the photo but when you put it on, it looks more clear than blue and it&#x27;s really difficult to remove with regular nail polish remover.</li>
    <li> I bought this nail polish just for fun to change up from my usual Essie Sugar Daddy.  It looked great, was very easy to apply, dried fairly quickly, didn&#x27;t smudge, and under halogen lighting it sparkles and shimmers.  I wouldn&#x27;t wear it all the time but  it was fun for a weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I got bored with it and tried to take it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nail polish remover... more nail polish remover... emery buffer... styrofoam buffer... more nail polish remover... can you believe SANDPAPER?!  I thought this stuff would never come off.  I&#x27;d be surprised if it couldn&#x27;t stop a bullet, it&#x27;s that hard.  After a whole hour -- approximately six minutes per nail -- I finally managed to get it all off.  I felt like I&#x27;d been through a marathon.  I was completely spent.  I don&#x27;t know what they put in that polish but they need to sell it with its own sandblaster or at least make a nail polish remover strong enough to take it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once was enough.  Never again.  No amount of sparkle is worth that hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Judy Lind</li>
    <li> It takes several coats before it becomes as pigmented as the pictures make it seem to be if you google images it and even with the black shatter it&#x27;s not very impressive. Pretty in the bottle but only OK on your fingers.</li>
    <li> Amazon sells these things that look like little plastic acorns that you put the acetone nail polish remover in one and and then he Snapit together with that and that has a whole you put your finger through and it actually soaks off glitter polish and it is the easiest thing in the world I think there to were three dollars well worth it you can use them over and over again and they are much easier to do than the foil in my opinion .**** do not use acetone polish on anything but natural nails it eats up acrylic and probably gel too . do not use acetone polish except on your own natural nail very important****</li>
    <li> After reading other reviews I have 2 things to say, first of all, when you look at the bottle it is clear to see that the color is not going to be that dark because it is more of a gel glitter unlike Teenage Dream that is more of a solid glitter, so I did not expect it to be any more than just a light blue shade with some glitter. second of all, the removal comments make no sense to me because as I said in my review for Teenage Dream, I have problems with the fact that BOTH of these colors peel right off my nails much too easily. However I do still like the color. its nice to wear if youre going to a party or a fun get together. and it looks really nice under the black or Blue shatters</li>
    <li> If you want to dazzle this polish is it.Amazon delivers way before due date.You don&#x27;t have to worry about a broken bottle.It came in one piece!This polish is the (Bright Blue) your nails want.The color stands out like the blue sky!!</li>
    <li> Great color&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I have to do daily touch ups.&lt;br /&gt; It cracks and chips off.&lt;br /&gt;The good news is you can not see the touch ups.</li>
    <li> Too flashy for my wife. Gave to daughter who loves it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this color nail polish.  It&#x27;s really fun and can be worn by itself or layered over another color.  I actually bought it to replace a tiny bottle of it that I already had (that had dried up).  Great stuff!</li>
    <li> Definitely not as bright as shown, it appears to be more of a top coat, I&#x27;ll probably have a buy a bright blue so I can get this look.</li>
    <li> This glitter is more subtle, but also goes with a  lot of nail polish colors.  It looks best with blue polishes:)</li>
    <li> I really liked this color.  It was a nice change.  My daughter&#x27;s told me to get with the program, so I did.  I got alot oc compliments on this color.</li>
    <li> I preordered this nail polish. When I got it, I loved it. The color is very cute, kind of a periwinkle color. But....it is SO hard to take off. I scrubed each nail for at least 5 minutes to fully get it off. When I went to get a pedicure, they had to use the electric grinder to take the polish off my toes. So, love the color, hate that it sticks like super glue!!</li>
    <li> Soooooo much glitter! The blue color is thin so if you want that to stand out, I&#x27;d recommend doing a base coat of white underneath. TONS of glitter, which is nice in that I didn&#x27;t have to do multiple coats to get the effect I wanted. Durable - I used these on the tips of my (natural) nails and it lasted all week. I&#x27;m rough on my nails so this is quite impressive.</li>
    <li> i love OPI this is theonly polish that doesnt chip it might be expensive but OPI is the best way to go, and yes i recommend it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not one for glitter, but this one caught my eye because it wasn&#x27;t one of those colors that are so bright that they look childish.  Blue is a hard color to pull off, but this one I will wear.</li>
    <li> Such a beautiful color I bought a few of these nail polishes and I am never let down, shipping took abit so if,buying for a gift would keep that mind..</li>
    <li> Better not pass this color by because it&#x27;s a must have for sure! As Katie Perry calls this color &amp;#34;Last Friday Night&amp;#34;, you&#x27;ll for sure want to make it every Friday night . So ladies jump aboard and get a hold of this !!!</li>
    <li> This color is glitter only. You need SEVERAL layers to get this color looking like the picture. And by then, it&#x27;s so thick it just peels off after several days. I&#x27;ve resigned to just using it as a topcoat over some colors to give them a little kick.</li>
    <li> i was DYING to get this, and as it has been discontinued, i was thrilled to find it. It definitely does not look as pictured. i suggest using it as a topcoat over white or navy nail polish. it also peels REALLY badly if you use more than 2 coats. As for the difficulty with getting it off, i had no issues. simply soak small pieces of cotton ball in pure acetone and let it soak on your nails for a few minutes. it will wipe right off. all in all, it was a pretty good product!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I suppose I should have known it would come as a light blue glitter color and not the deep grayish black or plum shown! Yeah, it&#x27;s the second pic offered and not the first (which is why clicked on the product). Totally false advertising and there should be an actual picture of what color they are offering! This way I wont click on something I am not looking for!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a bluish polish...not too dark, but not light. This looked perfect. I received the polish quite quickly,  however the polish is very, very dark. If you are looking for a gorgeous DARK blue polish, this would be perfect.</li>
    <li> I first tried this nail polish from a friend and wanted one for myself. This is EXACTLY what I wanted and was just like my friends except mine was BRAND NEW! I love it.</li>
    <li> Love OPI and I love this color. Such a fun color. I received so many compliments and questions about what color I was wearing and where i purchased it. Long wearing as well!!</li>
    <li> I think it may be the lighting that makes the nails look bright blue in the picture. The sheer polish base itself has a hint of blue. After 5 coats, my nails were definitely shimmery from the larger prism glitters to the fine blue glitters. Looking at my nails holistically, they are more of a deeper bluish-purple color. Still, I thought the color came out pretty nice especially after I slapped on some snowflake nail decals to get a wintery theme going. I&#x27;ll have to try it with a light sliver polish or white base next time to see if it&#x27;ll give it a brighter finish. If you get this polish, definitely don&#x27;t expect it to look like the photo but if you are creative enough, I think you&#x27;ll be able to get a nice outcome with it. Beats spending $35 on the Alice and Wonderland polish.</li>
    <li> HARD TO GET OFF. BUT YOU CAN PUT IT OVER OTHER COLORS. I HAVE BOUGHT BETTER GLITTER. WOULD NOT PURCHACES AGAIN. Although I DID GET ALOT OF COMPLIMENTS ESPECIALY PUTTING IT OVER BLUE</li>
    <li> For the darker color you might need to use a solid blue polish under the glitter. I used three coats of the glitter for a pale but sparkely blue. It took three coats of top coat to feel smooth. Takes a little work to get the glitter off of your fingernails. Have fun.</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed in this polish, It is clear polish with glitter. I don&#x27;t think you could ever put enough coats on to get the look in the picture:(</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife. Bottle came damaged. But owell. She put 4 coats of it on. Next day when she got to work it started peeling off. Looks nothing like the picture. Has more of a purple look than blue without that silver nail polish underneath.&lt;br /&gt;5star delivery speed,&lt;br /&gt;2 star product.</li>
    <li> Originally bought this for my daughter, but I love it! I like to put it over plain nail color for a beautiful splash of sparkle</li>
    <li> This is really pretty nail polish. I tried to make it look like the picture...That took a coat of silver nail polish underneath the 5 coats of this nail polish. It took awhile, but the end product looked wonderful and I got compliments on it</li>
    <li> Jazzes up your nails.  I used a light blue underneath to make it look more blue.  Worth the difficulty of removal for beauty.</li>
    <li> I love the glitter of this polish.  But the picture shown for this item makes it look more blue than it really is.  It is actually very sheer/clear blue with glitter.  Looks really great over another polish, but not as much by itself.</li>
    <li> OPI rarely lets me down! Excellent choice to add to my blue collection. Combined it with Blue my mind and it was a major hit.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter in law and she loved it.  I would totally recommend to friends and family.</li>
    <li> This is pretty but I thought it was going to be thicker then it was. I wouldn&#x27;t wear it alone unless I use a sponge to aply.</li>
    <li> This is super transparent. It is more of a pale blue tint with a few sparkles. I can imagine how many coats the model must be wearing. It&#x27;s not even that attractive as a topcoat. Pass this one by. It is quite uncharacteristic  for OPI to sell something of this low a quality.</li>
    <li> Es un esmalte precioso con un acabado sorprendente me ha gustado un monton y le he dado mucho uso y Opi suele tener esmaltes de muy buena calidad</li>
    <li> opi has great nail polish and i am so glad i got this one , i will continue to buy opi nail polish</li>
    <li> this polish is perfect for anyone who likes shimmery stuff. i bought this from my aunt, and i absolutely love this color :) its not overpowering or anything , unless you make it that way by adding like 50 coats. haha.</li>
    <li> One again I have purchased nail polish to get it and to see it aint what it say it is. This polish does not appear close to the product visual displayed on Amazon.</li>
