### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Followed all of the directions perfectly.</li>
      <li>What a way to make a customer happy!</li>
      <li>I love this product!!!!!</li>
      <li>Use a timer, and when you select the timing to leave the straightening cream in your hair, I feel it&#x27;s always best to go under a minute because you never know!     </li>
      <li>Would continue to use as is the best and easier at home treatment I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>I&#x60;m happy!</li>
      <li>So again, this product is a WONDERFUL LIFESAVER and TIMESAVER, but you have to take the time to fully understand your hair and the condition</li>
      <li>Good luck!  </li>
      <li>If followed correctly your hair will look beautiful but as with any chemical process, if not done correctly, there will be problems.</li>
      <li>used this in March 2010 and it worked great.  </li>
      <li>lol  </li>
      <li>I tried many do-at-home straighteners, and this was one of the best.</li>
      <li>It works really good for me.  </li>
      <li>Timing must be followed correctly to ensure good results.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it at home   with good results but do sometimes take it to my hair dresser since it&#x27;s easier for her.</li>
      <li>Loved this product, though I didn&#x27;t buy on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>What is best, and is always best when processing hair, is to DEEP condition it when you do wash it.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>USE YOUR OWN HAIR CONDITIONER AND SHAMPOO.</li>
      <li>I use it on my own hair.</li>
      <li>I initially liked the texture</li>
      <li>My honest review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My own fault.</li>
      <li>a relaxer meant mainly for wavy hair.. Would have been nice to know this before hand.. Would never recommend!!!</li>
      <li>It can&#x27;t take the strong chemical no matter how good your hair condition is.</li>
      <li>The product is great, and it&#x27;s about ten bucks cheaper which is great.</li>
      <li>My hair is straight and beautiful now, but def.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair, but a lot of it!</li>
      <li>so, I am VERY comfortable with do-it-yourself kits.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also very important, if you have a ton of hair, to have someone help you out, to make sure all your hair is thoroughly covered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love my hair afterwards</li>
      <li>It worked for a while, and then I could not purchase any more for some reason.</li>
      <li>LOVE</li>
      <li>Ok if you have curly hair this product will not work for you at all i followed all of the steps correctly and the results was nothing at all</li>
      <li>Please donot buy this instead buy bit more costly product</li>
      <li>I consider my hair to be fairly healthy despite the hair color and</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used cheaper products that work better then this.</li>
      <li>and my hair is soooo much better its extemely straighter although i still do have the frizz</li>
      <li>So after reading many reviews I decided to try it.</li>
      <li>No product magically straightens hair like the whisk of a magic wand.  </li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>Satisfied with the product but not the end result I was looking for.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>maybe the product would work better.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t find it in the store anymore either but am glad I can order here.  </li>
      <li>If anyone knows of a better product, please comment.</li>
      <li>Item was fairly easy to use although I like the results of the Ogilvie perms.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
      <li>easy to use and works well.</li>
      <li>this is not for fine hair.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so important.     </li>
      <li>maybe not board straight , but a nice over-the-counter product.</li>
      <li>I am extremely happy that i found a product that will actually help me with me unruly hair!!</li>
      <li>Know what your hair condition and hair texture are before you start...and be honest with yourself about what these really are.  </li>
      <li>You have to follow instructions precisely as written; otherwise, you can fry your hair.  </li>
      <li>My hair straightens great with a regular $7 relaxer from the store, and I paid 4 times that for this garbage.  </li>
      <li>This is just as good as the professional type.  </li>
      <li>i was so so so excited for this product.</li>
      <li>It is important to apply it quickly, follow the directions and know the type of hair you have to know the length of time to leave it on.</li>
      <li>It leaves your hair in great shape and if you do leave it natural it doesn&#x27;t ge that wierd wave with the straight ends.</li>
      <li>They say it should take about 5 minutes to apply (which is true if you just slop it on with no regard for you skin/face/ears or full application)</li>
      <li>Make sure to follow directions very well.</li>
      <li>hair blow dries out fairly straight but more full bodied than I like after using a permanent straightener.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Using Easy Straight means you HAVE to follow directions to the tee!</li>
      <li>I honestly trust Easy Straight over others I have tried over the years; and I thank the salon professional who invented it.</li>
      <li>So I was working super quick.  </li>
      <li>You need to move fairly quickly...</li>
      <li>Easy Straight causes my hair to become supple, shiny and manageable.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Easy Straight for 18 months now.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for a number of years with much success.  </li>
      <li>It is worth it.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite by far.</li>
      <li>i thought the amount of time it would take would be worth it.</li>
      <li>When using the straightener,as soon as you put it on, wash it off right away do not use the NEUTRALIZER AND DO NOT USE THE STRAIGHTENER AT THE ENDS OF YOUR HAIR.</li>
      <li>right</li>
      <li>Never before or after have I used a curl relaxer that was so natural and left my hair in such excellent condition.</li>
      <li>so if its not super healthly, once straight, the damage will most def show more than before...</li>
      <li>m ready to go!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an okay product overall</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not gonna let my most recent attempt with this product bias my opinion</li>
      <li>but it most definitely did not get rid of any of my curves i was so hopeful that afterwards i just wanted to cry because nothing happened.</li>
      <li>It took 2 hours of work for my hair to look exactly like it did before I started.</li>
      <li>CURLS (EXCEPT FOR THIS MOST RECENT TIME)&lt;br /&gt;DOES HELP CONTROL FRIZZ IN HUMID CONDITIONS</li>
      <li>I used this one 2 months ago and my hair still looks like the first day.  </li>
      <li>Most people with curly hair think they have coarse hair</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve used many different relaxers.</li>
      <li>The key is not to leave for more than 5 minutes after applying it all over.</li>
      <li>I bought a Kerastase kit to moisturize my hair before even try this one ;)  </li>
      <li>i followed the instruction exactly on there</li>
      <li>but this is supposed to be more gentle and marketed to non African Americans.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s so strong), but I followed the instructions exactly and not only did it not straighten my hair at all, but it FRIED it!!!  </li>
      <li>It turned my healthy hair into extremely dry hair.  </li>
      <li>However, people with curly hair tend to have hair that is more dry</li>
      <li>The instructions even tell you that if your hair is a certain length to have a friend help you to ensure you don&#x27;t over process.    </li>
      <li>I ended up purchasing conditioning shampoo and deep conditioner and my hair feels just fine now.    </li>
      <li>I have used Ogilvi3  for like forever and know it can be hard on your hair, and hope this would be a good alternative.  </li>
      <li>I really like this kit.  </li>
      <li>(MY ENDS ARE REALLY STRAIGHT AND ROOTS ARE WAVY</li>
      <li>My hair is very manageable, doesn&#x27;t take 2 hours to straighten anymore.</li>
      <li>You are still personally responsible for smoothing out your hair style.  </li>
      <li>I used this and now it is almost perfectly straight.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> NEVER in my life have I used such a poor excuse of a relaxer!  I&#x27;ve been relaxing my hair for over a decade and this was just a nightmare.  This is my first and last time trying this garbage.  Not only does it smell VILE (it burns your nose and lungs it&#x27;s so strong), but I followed the instructions exactly and not only did it not straighten my hair at all, but it FRIED it!!!  I&#x27;m going to have to cut it all off tomorrow and let it grow out now to start over.  That&#x27;s how bad it was.  It fried my hair so bad that it feels like straw and no amount of conditioner is helping it.  And I paid $30 for this junk!  My hair straightens great with a regular $7 relaxer from the store, and I paid 4 times that for this garbage.  Don&#x27;t use unless you want UNstraightened hair and you want fried hair.</li>
    <li> Loved this product, though I didn&#x27;t buy on Amazon.  I have thick, super curly hair (picture Alicia Keys or Tia/Tamara Mowry twins) and I typically only have my hairstylist straighten/blow out my hair because it would always take me forever.  I would spend more than an hour with a blow dryer and then more than an hour with the flat iron only to have mediocre results.  Since I put the Easy Straight in my hair it takes me about 10 minutes to blow dry my hair and maybe 10-15 minutes to flat iron.  What a life saver!!! My only complaint is that it usually only lasts in my hair about 2 months before the new growth drives me crazy....not the products fault.    There are a couple of things you should know before you use:    Obviously read the directions...IN FULL...not just how to apply!    1) It smells HORRIBLE....so keep it away from your nose since it is a chemical    2) Know what your hair condition and hair texture are before you start...and be honest with yourself about what these really are.  Most people with curly hair think they have coarse hair and they don&#x27;t so you could possible overprocess.  However, people with curly hair tend to have hair that is more dry so if its not super healthly, once straight, the damage will most def show more than before...but then again what can you expect if you decide to chemically process your hair to change the texture.    3) It clearly states in the instructions to not use if you have previously/recently used a \\&quot;relaxer\\&quot; (lye based or other similar products) or have lots of highlights or hair that has been colored (especially blonde or very light shades vs. original color)    4) If by some chance you still decide to use despite warnings in #3 you should invest in a super duper deep conditioner.  I consider my hair to be fairly healthy despite the hair color and the product did make my hair feel pretty dry when washing the first couple of times.  I ended up purchasing conditioning shampoo and deep conditioner and my hair feels just fine now.    5) You need to move fairly quickly...no hesitation...no fooling around.  They say it should take about 5 minutes to apply (which is true if you just slop it on with no regard for you skin/face/ears or full application) I think it took me about 8 minutes and I was moving fast.  Then processing time is 3 to 5 minutes.  So even at 3 minutes I was already over the maximum time of 10 minutes.  The instructions even tell you that if your hair is a certain length to have a friend help you to ensure you don&#x27;t over process.    So again, this product is a WONDERFUL LIFESAVER and TIMESAVER, but you have to take the time to fully understand your hair and the condition that its in and to read and follow the directions to the capital T!</li>
    <li> horrible product . did not work at all . my hair was as wavy as before. absolute waste of money !</li>
    <li> Didnt work at all.  And it smelled.  From now on I&#x27;ll leave it to the real professionals and just go to the salon.</li>
    <li> I just bought this product today from ulta and had my sister do it. i was very scared to try it because i have had my hair done in a salon before and nothing really changed. and so we used it, it took about an hour and my hair is soooo much better its extemely straighter although i still do have the frizz but whatever. atleast the horrible curls are gone and i dont have to worry about it taking an hour to straighten it everyday all im gunna need to do is a nice deep condition and go over it a few times with a straightener and im ready to go! I am extremely happy that i found a product that will actually help me with me unruly hair!! :) i would def recommend this to people. as long as you do it right i dont see how it wouldnt work for someone.</li>
    <li> I have used this hair relaxer several times. My hair is coarse/frizzy curly. I love my hair afterwards it is not hard and stiff. I also color my hair and it doesnt strip it. The key is not to leave for more than 5 minutes after applying it all over. It doesnt make it straighter if you leave it longer!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Easy Straight for 18 months now. I have naturally curly, very coarse hair. Using Easy Straight means you HAVE to follow directions to the tee! Timing must be followed correctly to ensure good results. I just used this again last week and I didn&#x27;t have any damage at all. My hair is very manageable, doesn&#x27;t take 2 hours to straighten anymore. I love this product!!!!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely hated the product.  It turned my healthy hair into extremely dry hair.  Yes, it&#x27;s straighter but looks horrible.  It&#x27;s been 6 months and I can&#x27;t wait for it to grow out.</li>
    <li> i was so so so excited for this product. i followed the instruction exactly on there i really don&#x27;t know what could have   gone wrong. but afterwards it seemed like nothing happen at all!! i washed off and my hair was a lot dryer and damaged but   my waves where still there. i have wavy thick hair and i feel like it helped the frizz but it most definitely did not get rid of any of my curves i was so hopeful that afterwards i just wanted to cry because nothing happened.</li>
    <li> I read the directions, followed them explicitly with timing and everything. It took 2 hours of work for my hair to look exactly like it did before I started.</li>
    <li> I have use this product a few times in the last few years. I don&#x27;t do it every 3 months because I fell the results last longer. I don&#x27;t want my hair completly straight, i just want to make my life easier when i want to blow dry it. Compared to other hair straighteners the damage is minimal. Would continue to use as is the best and easier at home treatment I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I try tons of different straightening products and none of them had me wash my hair during the process. This \\&quot;Easy Straight\\&quot; asked me to wash my hair at least 3 times during the process. I didn&#x27;t like that at all. Made me feel like I was washing out the product from my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used cheaper products that work better then this. this product looks like it damaged my hair. Not a fan. I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> This product works really well for me. I have thick and slightly coarse wavy to very wavy Indian hair, and the waves are just too much for me to bear and blow drying my hair straight is such a boring task for me (even if it takes about 20 minutes). Make sure to follow directions very well. Use a timer, and when you select the timing to leave the straightening cream in your hair, I feel it&#x27;s always best to go under a minute because you never know!     Afterwards, hair is a little coarse and dry, but that&#x27;s normal. The hair has just been through some changes and it takes a while. What is best, and is always best when processing hair, is to DEEP condition it when you do wash it. It&#x27;s so important.     The product is great, and it&#x27;s about ten bucks cheaper which is great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a number of years with much success.  I have naturally curly, unruly hair.  Easy Straight causes my hair to become supple, shiny and manageable.  It lasts approximately three months; the length of time it takes for new hair growth to come it.  I still have to blow dry and style my hair.  No product magically straightens hair like the whisk of a magic wand.  You are still personally responsible for smoothing out your hair style.  A warning.  Home hair straightening products are not for the inexperienced.  You have to follow instructions precisely as written; otherwise, you can fry your hair.  I honestly trust Easy Straight over others I have tried over the years; and I thank the salon professional who invented it.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;I have not received my order, and I have not received a response to my email... I will file a claim w/ my credit card if I don&#x27;t hear from you! PLEASE respond!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I was so afraid to try this after so many bad reviews.  You must blow dry the hair after applying the straightener, then apply the nuetralizer. I initially liked the texture but then it just turned all frizzy and worse than my hair would even be without any straightener.  I have used Ogilvi3  for like forever and know it can be hard on your hair, and hope this would be a good alternative.  Remember all straighteners are hard on your hair, but I don&#x27;t care to be even more frizzer than I was before!</li>
    <li> When I saw the reviews praising this product, I was incredulous!  I straighten my hair on a regular basis &amp; have used every home product &amp; salon service imaginable.  (Chi, Bio-ionic, Coppola Keratin, etc.)  This product was BY FAR the WORST!  I followed the instructions to a tee &amp; aside from giving me hair that smelled absolutely ATROCIOUS, it produced NO result.  Though I usually have my hair done professionally, I have been doing home treatments on myself &amp; friends/family for 25+ years so, I am VERY comfortable with do-it-yourself kits.  My hair is wavy &amp; average texture so, I can&#x27;t even begin to imagine that it would work for anyone with curly or coarse hair.  Don&#x27;t waste your time or money!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find it in the store anymore either but am glad I can order here.  It works really good for me.  I&#x27;ve used it at home   with good results but do sometimes take it to my hair dresser since it&#x27;s easier for her.</li>
    <li> I tried many do-at-home straighteners, and this was one of the best. My hair is wavy which is fine and fun in dry air, whereas in summer and rain it is all about frizz, frizz and frizz and miserable. This product does not make my hair flat boring straight but manageble, shiny, chasing away frizz! No damage was done.  It is a bit more expensive than other products found at drug stores, but I am going back to this. It is worth it.</li>
    <li> I have extremely thick, long and very curly hair.  Think Rosanna Rosanna Danna or Twisted Sister, it&#x27;s just crazy curly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this in March 2010 and it worked great.  You really have to follow the instructions very carefully.  Especially when determining how coarse your hair is.  Although mine is really bulky and thick, it&#x27;s not coarse, it&#x27;s more medium textured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We did my hair again today and it didn&#x27;t seem to end up as straight as last time.  I&#x27;m trying to remember, but I think I may have done a double application on it, using 2 jars instead of one, because I just have so much hair.  It&#x27;s definitely less poofy and frizzy but there&#x27;s still curl and waves going on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also very important, if you have a ton of hair, to have someone help you out, to make sure all your hair is thoroughly covered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does feel a little fragile and crackly at first but after a few washings it gets better.</li>
    <li> I have wavy, frizzy, coarse spanish type hair.  I have always been v. wary of straightening products and all the chemicals but this is supposed to be more gentle and marketed to non African Americans.  I used this product and was v.careful to not leave it on too long -- and I didnt do my whole head, because I was afraid that the time it would take to do that could affect my hair.  So I was working super quick.  Being nervous,  I washed it out ahead of time and was veeerrry careful to wash and rinse well.  Long story short, my hair was burnt off !!!!  I mean big patches of my head had hair that was 1/2\\&quot; long.  Really, no exageration -- my hair was ruined.  I complained to the company and they refunded me the price of the product.  that&#x27;s it.  They tried to say it was my fault, that I didnt wash it out properly etc etc....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They had a salon in my area and I asked for a remedial haircut and they refused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just dont buy this product.  In fact, go to a professional hairdresser if you want to put chemicals on your hair.</li>
    <li> easy to use and works well. maybe not board straight , but a nice over-the-counter product. it can seem a little pricey but.....you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair, but a lot of it! And curly. I don&#x27;t WANT curly. I read ever word of instructions and it still fried the ends of my hair and left it all over dry.  I couldn&#x27;t wait for my hair to grow out so the ends could be cut off (about an inch).  Bottom-line.. this is not for fine hair.  It can&#x27;t take the strong chemical no matter how good your hair condition is. I have it TWO stars only because it did relax it some and with coarse hair maybe the product would work better.  I won&#x27;t do this again!!</li>
    <li> This was the first and last time i will use this brand of hair straightener.After spending two hours working on my hair i ended up with a dry curly afro hairstyle.It did&#x27;nt even make my hair straight.I even read the directions twice before i started and the results were so bad i now am forced to chop off my all my hair and start over.I am going back to Ogilvie brand.This will not straighten your hair but make it a dry frizzy disaster.This product is so bad it should be pulled from the shelves.</li>
    <li> I really like this kit.  It made my hair soft.  This is just as good as the professional type.  Cheaper too!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I have super crazy frizzy hair. I used this and now it is almost perfectly straight. I errored on the side of caution and only left it on for the lesser time. My own fault. So I have a few stubborn spots that are slightly wavy. Over a year ago I spent almost $500 on one of those salon straightenings, and this worked just as good if not better!!!!</li>
    <li> It worked for a while, and then I could not purchase any more for some reason.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for yrs.  This product came from health &amp; beauty.  hopefully it was just a bad batch, but it did nothing.  and I mean nothing. next time, back to sally&#x27;s beauty supply.  I just received my order from sally&#x27;s beauty. the box dist. by hm mane solutions is the one that doesn&#x27;t work The box  that prints on the box \\&quot;zotos international from Ct. is the right one.</li>
    <li> Never before or after have I used a curl relaxer that was so natural and left my hair in such excellent condition. I have thin, frizzy hair and this left it so sleek and shiny! Never had the need to use any styling tool other than a hair blwer. To bad the manufacturer went out of business. (At least, that&#x27;s what I was told).</li>
    <li> did not work!! hair still as curly and now it&#x27;s super frizzy and dry!!</li>
    <li> This product did not straighten my hair and was difficult to apply. I have had my short curly hair professionally straightened numerous times and thought I would try and save some money so i know what to do and what to expect.  Not recommended.  I was so disappointed.</li>
    <li> I got this as a christmas stocking present because I&#x60;m obssessed w my hair lol  So after reading many reviews I decided to try it. Even though I read so many bad reviews about it, my hair is natural, not colored, and just slightly wavy so I thought it wouldn&#x60;t hurt.  My hair is straight and beautiful now, but def. dried out. The bad reviews were right. It does dry your hair A LOT and you will have to be prepared about it. I bought a Kerastase kit to moisturize my hair before even try this one ;)  So it works! I&#x60;m happy! But I wish it wouldn&#x60;t dry my hair so much... So it&#x60;s def a 3 star product!  Good luck!  :)</li>
    <li> My hair is curly and frizzy. I followed all the directions. Even called in to ask a few questions. However the product left my ends dry (which are ombre colored) and the curl is about 10 to 20 percent less. Not what I expected.</li>
    <li> I have been straightening my hair since I was 6, so I do know every product out there. I used this one 2 months ago and my hair still looks like the first day.  I don&#x27;t blowdry it, but it looks like I go to a salon everyday! I even went to my stylist to color my hair and she did notice a change in texture. I don&#x27;t have to run from the rain anymore nor apply hair products during my workday! The freeze is GONE!! LOVE IT!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But...I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that \\&quot;easy\\&quot; to apply by yourself. I had like 10 minutes to cover ALL my hair. And, the smell of the product was heavy! So, next time I will either ask for help from a friend or go with the product to my stylist.</li>
    <li> Product arrived missing most of the required straightening product, so it was totally ineffective. I have purchased this product elsewhere and really love it, but the product that I ordered on Amazon was totally ineffective as it was missing most of the product necessary to straighten your hair.</li>
    <li> I have very think coase hair and this product did nothing to my hair, since my hair is super long I used two kits.  I followed the instructions and left the product in longer than the 25 minutes it recommends.  No change in my hair. If anyone knows of a better product, please comment.</li>
    <li> Worse product ever, I got this after reading the reviews. I followed the instructions to the letter and it made my hair so dry and worse than any relaxer I used before. It is the last time I am buying this product.</li>
    <li> The product did not have any affect on my hair, the hair looked similar. Very bad experience. Please donot buy this instead buy bit more costly product</li>
    <li> Ok if you have curly hair this product will not work for you at all i followed all of the steps correctly and the results was nothing at all</li>
    <li> What a disappointment! Received this product in the mail with no instructions. Called the number on the box and an old woman answer the phone, she put me on hold for about 20 mins then came back and ask what was my question. I told her and she said hold on psl. I did again for another 10 mins and she came back and said i,m still looking for the direction and i cannot find it. Seems like she is at home tumbling through her stuff to read me the directions. What a way to make a customer happy! I used this product before so i have an idea what i was doing. The straighter was used by someone else for it was not seal and i found hair in the container. I learned a lesson and it cost me a price.</li>
    <li> I have used this product about a total of six times throughout the years. This most recent time I had the worst experience. And there was actually no difference, it didn&#x27;t straighten my hair at all this time. Called the makers they wouldn&#x27;t refund my money even though I lost a substancial amount of hair and my hair wasn&#x27;t straighter at all. *I will say though alot of my hair falls out all the time anyways. I&#x27;m not gonna let my most recent attempt with this product bias my opinion I am going to focus on my OVERALL experience with this product. My honest review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;ONE USE LASTS A LOT LONGER THAN 3 MONTHS (AT LEAST FOR ME)&lt;br /&gt;LOOSENS CURLS (EXCEPT FOR THIS MOST RECENT TIME)&lt;br /&gt;DOES HELP CONTROL FRIZZ IN HUMID CONDITIONS&lt;br /&gt;REDUCES BLOW DRYING AND STRAIGTENING TIMES DRASTICALLY&lt;br /&gt;FOR EXAMPLE I CAN STRAIGHTEN MY HAIR AND THEN GO OUT DANCING AND SWEAT ALL NIGHT AND MY HAIR WILL NOT HAVE THAT DREADED FRIZZY LOOK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;COST&lt;br /&gt;ONCE YOU USE IT YOU CAN&#x27;T STOP (MY ENDS ARE REALLY STRAIGHT AND ROOTS ARE WAVY WHICH MAKES FOR A WEIRD LOOK)SO YOUR STUCK IN AN ENDLESS PROCESS OF TRYING TO MATCH YOUR ROOTS WITH YOUR ENDS WHICH IS HARD TO ACCOMPLISH.&lt;br /&gt;LEAVES HAIR DRY, EXTREMELY DRY!&lt;br /&gt;YOU WILL LOSE CHUNKS OF YOUR HAIR WHILE DOING THE BRUSHING DURING THE SEALANT PHASE&lt;br /&gt;SMELL&lt;br /&gt;DIFFICULT APLICATION PROCESS&lt;br /&gt;I CAN&#x27;T JUST SCRUNCH MY HAIR AND GO WITH THE CUTE NATURAL CURL LOOK, BECAUSE MY ENDS ARE SO FLAT STRAIGHT AND LIFELESS. (THUS I AM STUCK EITHER STRAIGHTENING MY HAIR, PULLING IN UP IN A PONY TAIL, OR LOOKING CRAZY)&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps in your decision making. It&#x27;s an okay product overall I am going to look for a similar product with a lower price point.</li>
    <li> Applied product two days ago. I noticed after I rinsed it out that I still had all my curl. Waste of time, money, effort, too many steps and stinky.</li>
    <li> And it made my hair frizzy.  I followed the directions to a T.  Still didn&#x27;t work. Don&#x27;t have time to write anymore about this aaaaaand done.</li>
    <li> Followed all of the directions perfectly. Left the product in my hair for the longest recommended time and my hair is still curly. Buying this product is the same as setting your wallet on fire.</li>
    <li> I am a hairstylist and I&#x27;ve used many different relaxers. This is my favorite by far. I use it on my own hair. It leaves your hair in great shape and if you do leave it natural it doesn&#x27;t ge that wierd wave with the straight ends. The only thing is I will not do this at home. I bring it into the salon I work in and have them do it for me. It is important to apply it quickly, follow the directions and know the type of hair you have to know the length of time to leave it on. If followed correctly your hair will look beautiful but as with any chemical process, if not done correctly, there will be problems. I highly recommend this product but bring it to a professional.</li>
    <li> Worked, but didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> I have thick &amp; wavy hair. Takes for ever to flat iron. I used this &amp; it didn&#x27;t make it needle point straight but it took out the wave. All I have to do now is blow dry with a round brush and my hair is done. While it was wet I thought it didn&#x27;t really work all that well. But after I blow dried my hair it was how I wanted it with out flat ironing. Please read the directions at least twice. You have to do everything as it says. If in doubt about how long to leave it in your hair just do the lowest time. I did 5 mins for application. I pulled down as I put cream in. I used my hands. Noway could i do that in 5 mins with a brush! And let it sit for 3 mins. My hair is double processed &amp; medium texture so 3 mins was all my hair needed. No damage was done to my hair. I have used this product before but from Sally&#x27;s. I thought thick hair meant corse hair. Left it on for 5 mins &amp; did have some breakage. This was a few years ago. Also this is almost 1/2 the price Sally sells it for.</li>
    <li> I have very naturally curly hair. This product was recommended by a Sally&#x27;s associate who said it would straighten my hair which it also says straight hair on the box. I ended up with a frizz disaster.. My hair now will not go straight or curly and I have to flat iron everyday for 45 minutes which is frying my hair even more. When I called the 800 number on the box I was told it was not a straightener but a relaxer meant mainly for wavy hair.. Would have been nice to know this before hand.. Would never recommend!!!</li>
    <li> Item was fairly easy to use although I like the results of the Ogilvie perms.&lt;br /&gt;My hair blow dries out fairly straight but more full bodied than I like after using a permanent straightener.&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick full bodied hair.  Satisfied with the product but not the end result I was looking for.</li>
    <li> When using the straightener,as soon as you put it on, wash it off right away do not use the NEUTRALIZER AND DO NOT USE THE STRAIGHTENER AT THE ENDS OF YOUR HAIR. USE YOUR OWN HAIR CONDITIONER AND SHAMPOO.</li>
    <li> I got a perm early spring of 2012, it held really well. got pregnant and my hair started to grow like crazy! got really thick (normally i have thin hair and doesn&#x27;t hold a perm). I had expected the perm to wash out or at least be less curly by the end of the year. Half my hair was straight the other half curly. Previous with other perms i buy the home perm solution and then just use the product without putting my hair in curlers and my hair ends up straight again. This time i thought to buy this product since it was designed to straighten hair. My hubs helped me for the hour it took to go through the process.... i thought the amount of time it would take would be worth it. I was wrong! my hair is still curly. i admit not AS curly... but it&#x27;s def not straight. it&#x27;s a little easier to blow dry my hair straight than before and it&#x27;s less poofy... but it&#x27;s not straight. bought a home perm solution kit and am just gonna straighten my hair like i&#x27;ve done in the past. it was totally disappointing because there are SO MANY steps to this product and it took forever and i needed help with the application and the results were crappy. i think the girls on the box where they show the curly hair to straight hair is because the stylist blow dried or flat ironed the models hair!!! don&#x27;t buy this product unless you want to have an hour of your day gone that you&#x27;ll never get back :(</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work ! First I thought that I was doing something wrong but this is the second time I try it, and definitely doesn&#x27;t work...</li>
