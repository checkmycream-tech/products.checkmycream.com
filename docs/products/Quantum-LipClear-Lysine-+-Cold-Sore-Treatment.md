### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It is freaking awesome!</li>
      <li>Best ointment I ever used!</li>
      <li>stuff is awesome.</li>
      <li>This formulation is best for when you have an outbreak.</li>
      <li>I think drying it is the best thing you can do asap.</li>
      <li>Great!</li>
      <li>Good luck!</li>
      <li>This works great.</li>
      <li>It may be a great med for someone else</li>
      <li>And it works great too.    </li>
      <li>It goes great with EmergenC orange</li>
      <li>and you will get great results.</li>
      <li>LOVE IT!!</li>
      <li>very effective.</li>
      <li>moisturized my sunburned lips very nicely</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
      <li>...clean my lip with warm water and pat try...</li>
      <li>I gave it 2 stars because the cream itself is quite soothing and feels nice to apply.  </li>
      <li>so I could add my own powdered lysine to my own homemade lip balm.</li>
      <li>The best treatment so far was alcohol and petroleum jelly, which cleared it in a week.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Something interesting to note: Abreva is FDA approved.</li>
      <li>I have taken L-Lysine tablets with fair success, so I wanted to try this.  </li>
      <li>I hopefully never encounter. :)</li>
      <li>I recall my paternal granny having them, but she never had them more than a week, they looked like a blood blister and that was it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I found it and now am never without it on hand.</li>
      <li>More like a chopstick.</li>
      <li>And just like so many I too went to my dr before and got no relief.</li>
      <li>and says I should feel better in about 24-36 hours.</li>
      <li>And sooo cheap!</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m sure you all know.</li>
      <li>This is much more valuable research.</li>
      <li>I am less than impressed at the price, and I then look at all the remedies, and recall seeing LYSINE listed in many of the home remedies I read in my pain-filled stupor this weekend.</li>
      <li>I like that this is in a tube so you can just apply it on a clean qu-tip to eliminate from spreading more germs to the affected area.</li>
      <li>By the end of the day my lip was huge.</li>
      <li>(chocolate is a huge trigger for me).  </li>
      <li>Goes on smoothly.</li>
      <li>In a fit of desparation, i drove around looking for something to curb this beast growing on my face.</li>
      <li>, I know that I must sound like a sales rep</li>
      <li>It is cheap so truly, you have nothing to use.  </li>
      <li>im sticking with good old sea salt for now.</li>
      <li>I was leaving for vacation to that familiar tingle.</li>
      <li>as the day goes on, my lip swells more and more, and the pain becomes completely unbearable for the entirety of my weekend (during which I had to miss my college roommates</li>
      <li>Good for chapped lips thanks Amazon and thanks to Quantum the company who makes it and all the sellers</li>
      <li>I had a full blown sore by the time i got home.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s spectacular, and it&#x27;s natural....</li>
      <li>greatly prefer Abreva, and it&#x27;s worth the higher cost because it actually stops the itch and numbs the pain.</li>
      <li>NONE of those things has worked as quickly as this product.</li>
      <li>I simply have to add my voice to the choir - this product is amazing.</li>
      <li>This lip clear Lysine is better then anything they put out on the market .</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cool going on, somewhat soothing at first, but I swear it just increased the itching sensation I felt on my lips a hundredfold within minutes.</li>
      <li>apply this right away</li>
      <li>in a fairly hefty Prednisone taper to banging down the swelling, in hopes to alleviate SOME of my pain.</li>
      <li>so maybe give that a try in the future and see if it works for you :)</li>
      <li>FIRSTLY, it was soooooo soothing,i wished id had it from friday on thru my weekend.</li>
      <li>I bought this product yesterday for the first time.  </li>
      <li>Have been getting blisters/cold sores on my lip whenever I go out in HOT sunny weather.</li>
      <li>I comes home and take the first dose of Prednisone, and take mynpain meds</li>
      <li>Put first application on in the car.</li>
      <li>By far the best cold sore treatment available!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just using this product for the first time.  </li>
      <li>Make sure you start using it the second you feel that tingling coming</li>
      <li>it is excellent for stopping the formation of cold sores and ridding them quickly.</li>
      <li>I saw this and tried it but gotta say other than its color which is great for covering up my spot, it seems to bring back the blister...</li>
      <li>Blisters are still huge and icky.&lt;br /&gt;Friday afternoon - Blisters are somewhat smaller.</li>
      <li>Feels very soothing.</li>
      <li>All that means is they spent a ton of money to prove it&#x27;s safe to use on humans.</li>
      <li>This is why Abreva costs so much.</li>
      <li>and I put it on the whole time.</li>
      <li>It truly works and fast.</li>
      <li>This stuff is the texture of Vaseline and seems to do about as much...</li>
      <li>&gt;... being really pissed off at the pharmaceutical establishment.</li>
      <li>I wish i had had this stuff at the onset of symptoms, so i could tell just how well it really works.</li>
      <li>It is healing fast.</li>
      <li>I really hope that it works for you</li>
      <li>They would almost cover my whole mouth.</li>
      <li>Naturally clears up sores within 2-3 days, pain free and makes them barely visible.</li>
      <li>So far this product seems to be working pretty well</li>
      <li>After doing some more reseach I found L-Lysine ointement from Basic Oragnics which is sold at local GNC store.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Acyclovir has its place - absolutely, and perhaps even in concert with natural treatments like this.</li>
      <li>But, with this product available, there is absolutely no need.</li>
      <li>(normally I don&#x27;t get the warning tingle -</li>
      <li>The first sign of a tingle, I apply it to my lips, and when something does pop up, it barely lasts.</li>
      <li>I have never left a review before on Amazon, but I am on cloud 9 right now because of my now almost diminished cold-sore that started forming yesterday.</li>
      <li>I just get a blister) and apply numerous times a day plus right before bed.</li>
      <li>This product is the first one that I have purchased that actually does what it says it will do...</li>
      <li>, it actually makes a very glossy lip look without color!</li>
      <li>Yesterday I felt the tingle but was not able to get to my lysine when I was able to take them a bump had already started.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Either way...I believe this product has great merit, and it will be going in a little freezer Baggie with other rescue remedies for any future fever blisters</li>
      <li>As I put it on open sores, it did burn the first few hours, but then was fine.</li>
      <li>It is a very soothing and pleasant cream, but it is not diminishing my cold sore.  </li>
      <li>Great for cold sores and cankers just inside your mouth.</li>
      <li>Works great, its all I use to prevent cold sores from exploding.</li>
      <li>I completely forgot about that stuff until I logged onto Amazon to review this Lysine cream, but I used the Orajel last year and it worked FAST.</li>
      <li>this stuff apply&#x27;s on clear.</li>
      <li>This stuff works, and its natural.</li>
      <li>I applied this early and often (every hour) as the tingling had just started</li>
      <li>I used it in the evening, and by morning, the irritation was completely gone.</li>
      <li>As I&#x27;ve aged, they are much more contained but can still last quite a while (3 - 4 days of the blister plus a week+ of the scab recovery, especially on the mouth).</li>
      <li>I continued to put the ointment on the whole day and when I woke up the next day it was crusting over already!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I had a fever blister that I just couldn&#x27;t get rid of.  I tried everything and it just hurt!  I used this on it and in two days it was almost gone.  Feels very soothing.</li>
    <li> moisturized my sunburned lips very nicely</li>
    <li> This lip clear Lysine is better then anything they put out on the market . Fever blisters gone with this being used . Good for chapped lips thanks Amazon and thanks to Quantum the company who makes it and all the sellers</li>
    <li> I bought this product yesterday for the first time.  I had run to the store to buy Abreva (which I  know works).  However Abreva was $20 for a tiny tube and this was under $10 for a slightly bigger tube.  So I bought this as I had heard good things about lysine for cold sores.  I applied this early and often (every hour) as the tingling had just started (I only get cold sores about every 5 years or so, and only when I&#x27;m very stressed out).  I gave it 2 stars because the cream itself is quite soothing and feels nice to apply.  However this cream did virtually nothing to lessen the outbreak.  This morning I woke up with blisters and a big fat lip.  I ran to my bathroom and squeezed out the very last drop of my abreva cream and applied it right away, although its likely too late now to do much.  Abreva&#x27;s price is sadly too high and therefore prohibitive for some people.  If you are looking to soothe a cold sore I would buy this again, but it won&#x27;t stop the outbreak or decrease it at all, at least that&#x27;s what I found.</li>
    <li> This works great. Have been getting blisters/cold sores on my lip whenever I go out in HOT sunny weather. But I fee it&#x27;s too pricy. For about [...] you get very small quantity. After doing some more reseach I found L-Lysine ointement from Basic Oragnics which is sold at local GNC store. I paid about [...] and it has 4 times the quantity. And it works great too.    [...]</li>
    <li> This stuff works, you just have to use it! Goes on smoothly. This formulation is best for when you have an outbreak. It&#x27;s thick and yellowish, and looks gross, but absorbs nicely. I use a lysine balm preemptively when I do not have an outbreak, and I take lysine granules orally -up to 3000 mg at the onset of a cold sore, and 1000 mg daily if I remember. It goes great with EmergenC orange flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better than any expensive over the counter rip offs. Not as good as Valtrex, but that&#x27;s Rx only, and expensive. Sometimes I would take it if I suspected a cold sore coming on, but it&#x27;s better not to become immune or desensitized to prescription meds by overuse. I prefer to save the big guns for when it&#x27;s life threatening. (I do not know if Valtrex desensitization works that way but I prefer not to find out the hard way.)</li>
    <li> I have gotten cold sores most of my life and tried a lot of things to ease the pain and heal them quickly. NONE of those things has worked as quickly as this product. I started getting a cold sore last week, used this product the second I felt it coming on, and it basically retreated and never fully developed. A few days later I got another one on another part of my lip and it healed so quickly it didn&#x27;t even have the chance to get crusty (sorry, I know that&#x27;s gross).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is literally changing the way I feel about cold sores. I used to get them and they&#x27;d hang on for days, sometimes WEEKS. I feel like now, they are healing faster and are way less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Abreva for years and this product far surpassed Abreva in effectiveness; and it&#x27;s less than half the price.  Use it every 1-2 hours and you will get great results. Make sure you start using it the second you feel that tingling coming on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something interesting to note: Abreva is FDA approved. All that means is they spent a ton of money to prove it&#x27;s safe to use on humans. They do not have to prove it&#x27;s effectiveness; the cold sores eventually go away on their own sooner or later. This is why Abreva costs so much. The makers of Lysine Plus on the other hand actually spent money studying the effectiveness of the product and found that it healed cold sores in about half the time as not treating them. This is much more valuable research.</li>
    <li> I get cold sores. And I don&#x27;t mean just a cold sore,  but I flaming sore of hate and disgust. I woke up on the morning I was leaving for vacation to that familiar tingle. The tingle that makes you want to chop off your lips and hide in bed for a week. I went to the store and after looking at reviews of all the cold sore products in the isle, I chose Lysine +. I started using it as soon as I got in the car. It didn&#x27;t seem to work all that well, but I kept on putting it on because I was thinking about all those beach pictures with a hideous cold sore. We drove 14 hours and I put it on the whole time. The next day it got bigger, but seemed like it stopped growing. I continued to put the ointment on the whole day and when I woke up the next day it was crusting over already!! Like I said, I get awful cold sores. 5-6 blisters with pain and embarrassment like none other. This product literally saved my vacation (it couldn&#x27;t treat the attitude of the other people on vacation with me, however).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy this product and have it on hand. From the day I started using it to 36 hours later the cold sore was almost gone. It is now 5 days later and you can barely see it was there. I have already recommended this to other people who suffer from cold sores and I hope it works as well for them as it did for me!</li>
    <li> very effective. shortens healing time of cold sores by a couple of days. I hate that the ointment is only 7 grams but other than that would recommend to those suffering from cold sores</li>
    <li> Best ointment I ever used! I have been buying abreeva before, and been on prescribed medication valtrex, but it was of little use. Several days into the last outbreak, I found this at walmart, and tried it. As I put it on open sores, it did burn the first few hours, but then was fine. The blisters healed off OVERNIGHT(!) and it was only red after. I will keep this at hand from now on!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a long time sufferer of cold sores. I used to get them wicked bad as a child and teen. They would almost cover my whole mouth. As I&#x27;ve aged, they are much more contained but can still last quite a while (3 - 4 days of the blister plus a week+ of the scab recovery, especially on the mouth). This is the only non prescription ointment that works. Within 1 day, the initial blister is gone and if there is a scab, it clears within 2 to 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply this right away (normally I don&#x27;t get the warning tingle - I just get a blister) and apply numerous times a day plus right before bed. Since I&#x27;m a woman, the extra shine looks like lip gloss so I don&#x27;t mind it. Might be slightly off putting for a man but, then, so are cold sores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abreva never worked for me and I tried and tried with that product. I know it works for some people but it&#x27;s an expensive waste for me. I think the healing herbs and lysine in this product make a difference. I&#x27;m glad I found it and now am never without it on hand.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle cream, but it definitely speeds up the healing! Normally it takes up to two weeks before my cold sores go away, but with this it looks so much better after one week. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> local stores seem to have quit carrying this product.  it is excellent for stopping the formation of cold sores and ridding them quickly.</li>
    <li> When I felt a cold sore coming on, I started applying this. It shortened the usual few days down to 1.  For me, worked great to stop the cold sore from getting worse and heal what has already started.</li>
    <li> Works great, its all I use to prevent cold sores from exploding.</li>
    <li> Order 20% zinc oxide from your local pharmacy.  This is weak at 1% zinc oxide.  Butt Paste is 16% and you can purchase in the baby section of retail stores.</li>
    <li> It is 2:30am and I was just looking up this product. my story is lengthy, but I would like to tell it. I am 43 years old, and have never had a fever blister in my life. I recall my paternal granny having them, but she never had them more than a week, they looked like a blood blister and that was it. I never knew if they were painful...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;fast forward to Tuesday 8/12: it appears I have a zit on my lip edge. (not uncommon for me) and so I try to pop it, and put bacitracin on it. it never really resolves (duh) but I never had any tingling I now hear is common with fever blisters. I see my doc&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Friday 8/15 at 9:00am, and he gives a script for Valtrex. and says I should feel better in about 24-36 hours. I&#x27;m in considerable pain, but thinking I will be in LESS over the weekend. as the day goes on, my lip swells more and more, and the pain becomes completely unbearable for the entirety of my weekend (during which I had to miss my college roommates wedding I have been waiting months to attend). narcotic pain meds are the ONLY thing to take the sharp edges off my pain, I develop an intimate sleeping relationship with alternating ice packs and applications of Anbesol to cope. misery doesn&#x27;t even cover it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Monday 8/18 I return to my doctors office, he is off until Wednesday, so I see a colleague. we ramp up the Valtrex to 3x/day and&lt;br /&gt;add in a fairly hefty Prednisone taper to banging down the swelling, in hopes to alleviate SOME of my pain. While in the CVS, I stock up on Anbesol for the inside lip pain, and look for Abreva. I am less than impressed at the price, and I then look at all the remedies, and recall seeing LYSINE listed in many of the home remedies I read in my pain-filled stupor this weekend. and it was significantly less expensive. so I figure what the hell? I comes home and take the first dose of Prednisone, and take mynpain meds...clean my lip with warm water and pat try...and I apply the Lysine. FIRSTLY, it was soooooo soothing,i wished id had it from friday on thru my weekend. i go to rest and wake up a few hours later and two of the blisters have started draining (which being a nurse I know is needed for healing and will reduce pain because the pressure inside the lip is lessened)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, of course, who knows if it&#x27;s the Valtrex finally kicking in (doubt it) or a result of the Prednisone (I&#x27;m asthmatic, I know it works that fast) or if it&#x27;s just the Lysine...OR a COMBO of all THREE. But I do know, it immediately soothed the tightness and burning that my lip was doing this evening and I finally feel I am on the healing side of the mountain (and praying he last two days were The Worst Of It).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way...I believe this product has great merit, and it will be going in a little freezer Baggie with other rescue remedies for any future fever blisters I hopefully never encounter. :)</li>
    <li> It is freaking awesome! I have had cold sores since I was a little girl and I got one every other month. I have tried EVERYTHING! I&#x27;ve gone to doctors, I&#x27;ve tired herbal remedies. When i tried lysine in the topical and the pill form everything changed, I get them less and when I do get them they aren&#x27;t there as long. LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> I have been dealing Cold sores all my life. About 5 years ago I decided to figure out what causes them for me. I have found out tomato sauces and coke not Pepsi. But that ruled out a lot of food so I did research and have been taking Lysine, but sometimes I would forget.  I saw the reviews on this decided to try it. Yesterday I felt the tingle but was not able to get to my lysine when I was able to take them a bump had already started. By the end of the day my lip was huge. Next day I did everything I did before popped it applied alcohol ect.. This works but takes time I bought this ointment at cvs by the time I got home 30 mins it went down over half the size. 😃&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never right reveiws but I feel I should since I have suffered just like a lot of other people with cold sores. And just like so many I too went to my dr before and got no relief.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about everything with cold sores like all of you. I&#x27;d list them all but I&#x27;m sure you all know. I have a current breakout and usually my cold sores don&#x27;t last this long. I&#x27;ve been using herpecin L and vaseline/carmex. I just realized it&#x27;s probably because I haven&#x27;t been using lysine +. I just looked over the ingredients and they&#x27;re all legit. Everything you&#x27;d try for a DIY cold sore remedy is in this ointment. Everyone is different, of course. But I&#x27;d seriously try this one. You never know.</li>
    <li> I purchased a tube of this yesterday at a local store. I was gonna purchase it offline because its cheaper but I already have a cold sore and I did not feel like waiting for the shipping time. So far this product seems to be working pretty well and it definitely eliminates the pain of the sore. I&#x27;ve used Abreva for years but like most people who get cold sores know its very expensive and isn&#x27;t as good for the price you pay, plus it apply&#x27;s on the skin white this stuff apply&#x27;s on clear. I like that this is in a tube so you can just apply it on a clean qu-tip to eliminate from spreading more germs to the affected area. Oh and just a tip for those who don&#x27;t know much about treating cold sores,  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of things as I&#x27;ve been getting them since I was a young child and in my experience if you apply ice to the area where you feel the first sign/tingle of a cold sore it helps stop the progress and growth of the cold sore. I&#x27;ve done it a few times at the very first feeling of one and it never reached past the surface of my lip so maybe give that a try in the future and see if it works for you :)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get cold sores often , maybe once or twice a year if that much. When I do get them, I don&#x27;t get them on my lip but on the area between my bottom lip and my chin. I&#x27;ve always gotten them since I was a child. Nothing&#x27;s ever worked. The best treatment so far was alcohol and petroleum jelly, which cleared it in a week. Until Lysine.&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s my timeline:&lt;br /&gt;Wednesday - Thursday overnight - I woke up with that tingling on my chin. Went back to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;Thursday morning - had a tiny blister in the area. I dabbed it with some petroleum jelly.&lt;br /&gt;Thursday afternoon - tiny blister turned into multiple blisters. I went to the drugstore and bought Lysine. Put first application on in the car. Applied every two hours as directed. Until I went to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;Friday morning - blisters are huge and icky. I applied alcohol, then Lysine.&lt;br /&gt;Friday all day - Lysine every two hours. Blisters are still huge and icky.&lt;br /&gt;Friday afternoon - Blisters are somewhat smaller. Still applying Lysine every two hours.&lt;br /&gt;Friday evening - applied alcohol and Lysine every two hours until bedtime.&lt;br /&gt;Saturday - applied alcohol and Lysine every 2 to 3 hours.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s Saturday night as I&#x27;m typing this, the blisters are dried up and not oozing. The cold sore is no where near as noticeable as it was Friday. I&#x27;m going to keep the regime up tomorrow and I presume come Monday, cold sore will be close to nonexistent.&lt;br /&gt;So, about 2 to 3 days for my cold sore to clear up using Lysine (and alcohol) versus one to two weeks using nothing.&lt;br /&gt;I am now a faithful user of Lysine for life.&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE*** Sunday evening - the initial blister is a mere scab and the other blisters are GONE!!! I&#x27;ve applied Lysine three times today so far.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is awesome.</li>
    <li> I simply have to add my voice to the choir - this product is amazing. I had known about the effectiveness of Lysine against cold sores for a long time now. I would take a 500mg pill a day (when I could remember), and even went so far to buy lip balm making supplies so I could add my own powdered lysine to my own homemade lip balm. But, with this product available, there is absolutely no need. This product works - it&#x27;s spectacular, and it&#x27;s natural.... and this leads me to...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;... being really pissed off at the pharmaceutical establishment. Everything we feel about cold sores has honest to goodness been invented by the pharmaceutical industry to make us feel the need for prescription medication that is far less effective than simple, natural treatments like this. Acyclovir has its place - absolutely, and perhaps even in concert with natural treatments like this. But, when people are convinced that even expensive drugs like Abreva are the only solution to their cold sores (or even, that they are \\&quot;suffering\\&quot; from these \\&quot;debilitating\\&quot; \\&quot;outbreaks\\&quot;), they are being sucked into misleading marketing. This stuff works, and its natural. If you want to significantly speed the healing time of your cold sores, try it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I keep this in my pocket AT ALL TIMES.  The first sign of a tingle, I apply it to my lips, and when something does pop up, it barely lasts.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nasty smell that I learned to love.  I have these things in my nose and it worked there as well.</li>
    <li> By far the best cold sore treatment available! And sooo cheap! Its a miracle. Naturally clears up sores within 2-3 days, pain free and makes them barely visible. I wish they made a lip gloss that naturally has this sheen too, it actually makes a very glossy lip look without color!</li>
    <li> I have been getting cold sores for almost 10 years now and they are absolutely the most horrible experience. They are ugly and painful and I would feel utterly despondent when I felt that tingle on my lip, knowing there was nothing I could do to stop it. I&#x27;ve tried everything over the years from Abreva to homemade remedies and came across Lysine+. EVERY SINGLE TIME I HAVE USED IT (though you must put it on IMMEDIATELY when you feel the cold sore coming), the cold sores have never emerged and within 1-2 days, the tingling sensation would be gone. GONE. I mean it when I say that Lysine+ has been my miracle. I used to get cold sores every 1-2 months. It is almost June, and I haven&#x27;t gotten a single one since last October before I started using it. I recommend that everyone who suffers from cold sores at least tries this product. It is cheap so truly, you have nothing to use.  Plus, it just looks like lip gloss when you put it on! Pick it up now and keep it on you so that if you do feel coming, you can put it on immediately. I really hope that it works for you too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw, I know that I must sound like a sales rep and I swear I am not. Just someone who hates cold sores and know how much they can put your life on hold when you have them. Good luck!</li>
    <li> My son had a nasty canker sore on his gums that wouldn&#x27;t go away. I used several creams and tried DoTerra essential oils but nothing worked. Finally, I picked this up and applied it once an hour. By the fifth hour, the canker sore was almost completely gone. By the end of the day, it was totally gone. I&#x27;m still shocked. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just using this product for the first time.  It is a very soothing and pleasant cream, but it is not diminishing my cold sore.  I&#x27;ve been getting cold sores all my life, and I generally get one every two or three months (chocolate is a huge trigger for me).  I have taken L-Lysine tablets with fair success, so I wanted to try this.  I will continue to use it in concert with my trusty Abreva.  Abreva absolutely diminishes the life of a cold sore, I just find it very drying, and then my lips peel.  This ointment soothes the drying and peeling, but I don&#x27;t find it at all effective in healing or shortening the life of my cold sore.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the texture of Vaseline and seems to do about as much...which is next to nothing. It&#x27;s cool going on, somewhat soothing at first, but I swear it just increased the itching sensation I felt on my lips a hundredfold within minutes. In fact, this time my cold sores weren&#x27;t itching at all until I put this stuff on. I bought it because I&#x27;ve heard Lysine is good for the skin of your lips, but I&#x27;m beginning to wonder if that&#x27;s a myth, because it doesn&#x27;t seem to have ever helped me with cold sores, in either pill form or in this cream. Another thing I dislike about this product is the color. It&#x27;s brown and shines like Vaseline, so it looks like I have syrup all over my mouth. I wouldn&#x27;t wear it out in public. It&#x27;s quite greasy and hard to get off your fingers with just soap and water, so you can imagine the grease on your mouth. It also has a rather bad odor. It&#x27;s very similar to Releev in color and odor, but whereas the Releev I&#x27;ve tried is a runny brown liquid that looks like syrup on your mouth, this Lip Clear Lysine+ is a greasy brown syrup for your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I greatly prefer Abreva, and it&#x27;s worth the higher cost because it actually stops the itch and numbs the pain. I also recommend Orajel Single Dose Cold Sore Treatment. I completely forgot about that stuff until I logged onto Amazon to review this Lysine cream, but I used the Orajel last year and it worked FAST. It stings really bad going on, and I recall that it puffed up my lips painfully for several minutes, but when the swelling and numbness receded my lips cleared up within 24 hours. I did use both doses that came in the package, one in the afternoon and one before bed, but it worked miracles. I don&#x27;t get cold sores often, but when I do, my entire mouth blisters up. I never get just a single cold sore. My lips break out in a very painful, lingering rash that makes it difficult to even eat and drink. So I&#x27;ve got a lot of experience with this and that treatment. (I&#x27;m allergic to Zovirax, Valtrex, Valacyclovir, Acyclovir, etc. so these over-the-counter things are all I can do.)</li>
    <li> So, ive suffered from cold sores since i was a kid. Super embarrassing and painful. They became less frequent as i got older, but i still seem to get them a couple times a year. I felt one coming on saturday mid-day...all i had with me at work was a bottle of Releev. I put it on, but alas...it didnt seem to do anything. I had a full blown sore by the time i got home. I woke up sunday to the dreaded HUGE blistery gross mess on my lip. blechhh... In a fit of desparation, i drove around looking for something to curb this beast growing on my face. I saw the Lysine ointment decided to give it a go. Within hours it was working. The sore shrank, and was barely above surface by the end of the day. I wish i had had this stuff at the onset of symptoms, so i could tell just how well it really works. But, its monday now and im on the healing stage already. I like this stuff because it has olive oil, vitamins a/e/d, honey and beeswax so it doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my lips out, even though it has the tea tree oil in it. I&#x27;ll definitely be keeping this in my purse from now on.</li>
    <li> I usually get one cold sore every couple of years. Suddenly, I had a rash of them on my chin! I took a prescription med, used an OTC topical anti-viral cream, AND took lysine pills, all for 2 1/2 days till I remembered I had this lysine cream. I used it in the evening, and by morning, the irritation was completely gone. I&#x27;ve had it on the area all day today, as well, and I can FEEL it healing. XOXOXO to this product.</li>
    <li> I have had cold sores all my childhood up until my 20&#x27;s....haven&#x27;t gotten them since, but a few months ago and I looked up everything about them to get rid of them. Some say don&#x27;t pop the blister and keep petroleum jelly on it...some say put ice asap and pop blister and dry it out....a lot say to take lysine.  I saw this and tried it but gotta say other than its color which is great for covering up my spot, it seems to bring back the blister...To treat my cold sores I used to use aloe from my plant, than I discovered rubbing alcohol, then tea tree oil...and now I&#x27;m just using plain sea salt. I think drying it is the best thing you can do asap. The cream seems to keep it moist. I&#x27;ll keep it on hand...but I now take lysine supplements, and im sticking with good old sea salt for now. I think this one will be a lot quicker to heal than the last one which took 2 weeks because I let it blister. This time I got rid of the blister and dried it right out. I even keep salt on it when I go to bed.</li>
    <li> This is my first time having a cold sore. Just wondering how long I have to use this till it&#x27;s all gone</li>
    <li> This product has NO expiry date.&lt;br /&gt;I recently purchased from the  Amazon Market Place and when I open it, it comes out like water.&lt;br /&gt;It must have been a very old stock or exposed to extreme heat.&lt;br /&gt;I will not trust any health care product that has no expiry date.</li>
    <li> My toddler gets a weird rash around her mouth and the pediatrician said it&#x27;s nothing to worry about, but I just could not get rid of it. Lip clear got rid of it in a matter of 3 days (after on and off months of trials with other products).</li>
    <li> It may be a great med for someone else but it didn&#x27;t work for me. Didn&#x27;t feel that it was working at all. More like a chopstick. Shipment was promp though.</li>
    <li> I have never left a review before on Amazon, but I am on cloud 9 right now because of my now almost diminished cold-sore that started forming yesterday. This stuff has absolutely worked better than everything I have tried before for my cold sores. And I have tried everything in the book: Abreva, carmex, nail polish remover, apple cider vinegar, crushed up vitamin c, tooth paste, acne cream, hand sanitizer, aloe, camphoe-phenique. All this while taking Lysine supplements. I even was so desperate one time I used straight-up bleach. I am not the type that willingly damages my body, but when I get a cold sore, I become irrational, frantic and hyperfocused on just getting the thing to GO AWAY! I started getting yet ANOTHER cold yesterday morning. It was already in the blister stage. I slathered it with this stuff and continued to do so every hour. It stopped the blisters from getting any bigger than a pin-head. They never swelled up or got red or were even noticeable really. Now, the tiny blisters look like they were deflated inside. No gastly scab. I don&#x27;t believe there is any product out there that will immediately heal a cold sore. But this product stopped mine in its tracks and it even started improving after about 24 hours.</li>
    <li> This product is the first one that I have purchased that actually does what it says it will do...I now have one in my car, my desk and my coat pocket and my purse so that I am never without it.</li>
    <li> I had a terrible cold sore. This product gave relief in two days. It is healing fast.</li>
    <li> literally did nothing. I don&#x27;t understand the hype.</li>
    <li> Great for cold sores and cankers just inside your mouth.</li>
    <li> I have tried the expensive cold sore treatments like abreva thinking that the higher price must mean it works better, but I was completely wrong. Abreva literally did nothing for me, and then I heard about lysine, and figured I had nothing to lose. So then I applied it frequently for 2 or 3 days and no one even knew I had a cold sore, it didn&#x27;t hurt, and it was gone within a few days. This stuff is amazing! I recommend at least trying it because it is fairly cheap compared to the alternatives.</li>
    <li> This stuff works, stops growth dead in its tracks and stops the pain at the same time. I have used abreva and a prescription cream too and neither came close.</li>
    <li> Great! My daughter was getting blisters and once we started using this she hasn&#x27;t gotten another one! We have had it for about 6 months and after about a month we didn&#x27;t need it anymore. Anytime she gets a tingle I apply a small amount with a Q-tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She also had what looked like scarring on the side of her lip where she usually got them and it is gone. These blisters really hurt her and would last for days!</li>
    <li> I could not find anything to take away my fever blisters fast enough until i found this product. It truly works and fast. It feels so soothing on your lips as well. Any one who has ever had fever blisters know that they burn....well this ointment will take the burning feeling out as well. I would of given it ten stars.</li>
</ol>
