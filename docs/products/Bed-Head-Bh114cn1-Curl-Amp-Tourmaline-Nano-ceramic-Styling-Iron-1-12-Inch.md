      <li>and I love Bead Head styling irons.  </li>
      <li>(That made for an interesting day...</li>
      <li>My sister in law was so pleased she is getting one for herself.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>I love the easy on and off button and the adjustable heat dial.  </li>
      <li>This curling iron is good for an almost straight effect.</li>

      <li>This isn&#x27;t the absolute most amazing curling iron out there, but for the price, it&#x27;s fantastic.  </li>
      <li>This curling iron is worth so much more than the price I paid, but don&#x27;t tell Bed Head that</li>
      <li>The price was fantastic - I would have paid twice what I did for this thing.</li>
      <li>I love the fun color, and am so relieved that the heat setting dial is positioned in a way that you are not accidentally changing it while styling your hair.</li>
      <li>It gets nice and hot quickly and doesn&#x27;t pull you hair.</li>
      <li>This is the same size as the Revlon one I loved for years - heats up quickly, curls well, looks good on my bathroom counter, makes us happy looking at the pink color (and fun lights, when it&#x27;s on), and is void of the sticky build up</li>
      <li>I was so excited &amp; looking forward to receiving this, but when I received it, it didn&#x27;t work...</li>
      <li>It was ok, I ended up selling it in a garage sale, because it was just too large for me</li>
      <li>Nothing special.</li>
      <li>I am pleased that for the price it works very well.&lt;br</li>
      <li>it heats up fast and looks great!I love that it lights up.</li>
      <li>Not a bad deal for the price.</li>
      <li>product is easy to use and heats up very fast.</li>
      <li>I used it the other day and my curls looked great.  </li>
      <li>Spend a little more on a good iron.</li>
      <li>quick note:</li>
      <li>It heats up quickly and works well.  </li>
      <li>It heats up quickly, curls my hair quickly, and it lasts.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for nice big loose curls and adds volume and shape to your hair.</li>
      <li>I have tried other irons in this price range and this one is by far the best.</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s possibly because this curling iron does such a great job that I can&#x27;t imagine needing anything more.  </li>
      <li>what can i say, it works great and the price is right, as good as the expensive ones, the end</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s worth the price with it&#x27;s work horse and uniform performance in every day use.</li>
      <li>Well worth the money.</li>
      <li>As with other Bed Head curling irons, they did a good job of putting the control where you won&#x27;t accidentally turn it off.</li>
      <li>This curler&#x27;s appearance is super adorable and the different color temperature settings are useful.</li>
      <li>I love my new style and my new curling iron!</li>
      <li>This is my second Bed Head Curling Iron and I&#x27;ve been just as pleased as I was with the first.  </li>
      <li>If this doesn&#x27;t concern you the light feature is pretty cool since it lights up different colors depending on how hot you set it.</li>
      <li>heats up fast!</li>
      <li>I intend on purchasing this exact one.</li>
      <li>Amazon made the experience okay though because they gave me return authorization &amp; credited my money back to me.</li>
      <li>My first 1.5 inch curling iron was a bust</li>
      <li>Even if you are used to having to use the &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; setting on hair appliances, try out the medium setting first.</li>
      <li>The curl fell right out which is unusual for my hair.</li>
      <li>Gets hot fast and stays hot evenly.</li>
      <li>I ordered it while I wait for my stylist to purchase me a professional curling iron (at a much higher price!)</li>
      <li>Heats up fast and furious.  </li>
      <li>Your curls/waves turn out to be shiny as it says in the description and makes your hair very voluminous.</li>
      <li>but my curls fall out fast.</li>
      <li>I have the 1-1/2 inch model and it works really well for my Heat Defiant Wig.</li>
      <li>but my hair doesn&#x27;t hold curls real well.  </li>
      <li>that upset me because I was really looking forward to owning a Tourmaline.</li>
      <li>I really like this iron</li>
      <li>I really like the styling iron.  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t hold much of a curl.</li>
      <li>The heat level and product quality are not the same as with the original.</li>
      <li>More like a natural fullness and finishes the ends nicely (instead of stiff and dry just after blow drying).  </li>
      <li>Used on my hard to curl hair and was very pleased.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend the Bed head products.</li>
      <li>My daughter and I love how the sides of the curling iron light up in a futuristic way, ramping up from yellow lights (on low) to green lights (on medium or high settings).</li>
      <li>They heat quick and leave your hair shiney and the curls stay in for a long time.  </li>
      <li>I bought it, it died...got a new one</li>
      <li>This one does not get hot enough to do the job well.</li>
      <li>and it isn&#x27;t hot enough!</li>
      <li>Also used on my sister in laws thick straight Asian hair and it curled nicely.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure more than a few small children were scared when they saw me!)</li>
      <li>I was surprised at how hot this actually got.</li>
      <li>Sometimes just to get a but of body I will flat iron my hair first then curl the iron.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t find a large barreled curling iron...unless I wanted to take out a second mortgage.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use this every other day to style short, silky hair with a bit of natural curl. It give me the look I want. The quick heating and temperature indicator light are great.</li>
    <li> This curler&#x27;s appearance is super adorable and the different color temperature settings are useful. Your curls/waves turn out to be shiny as it says in the description and makes your hair very voluminous. The only problem I had with the curler is that the clamp length isn&#x27;t long enough to put much hair on (I have very long hair).</li>
    <li> love! love! love! this product will be buying the flat iron and the wave iron as will i do believe they have a wond and i will get that to</li>
    <li> I love the fun color, and am so relieved that the heat setting dial is positioned in a way that you are not accidentally changing it while styling your hair. My only complaint would be with the lights on the sides - you may think it&#x27;s a cool feature, and it is, but I am sensitive to lights and they often trigger migraines for me when they hit my eyes at funny angles. If this is true for you as well this probably isn&#x27;t the best option for you. If this doesn&#x27;t concern you the light feature is pretty cool since it lights up different colors depending on how hot you set it.</li>
    <li> what can i say yes i purchased another bed head curling iron this was purchased because of barrel size.  great for any length hair they have a barrel size that is pefect for you.</li>
    <li> I was so excited &amp; looking forward to receiving this, but when I received it, it didn&#x27;t work...that upset me because I was really looking forward to owning a Tourmaline. Amazon made the experience okay though because they gave me return authorization &amp; credited my money back to me. Sad to not have a Tourmaline, but thankful for Amazon and their customer service...</li>
    <li> It was ok, I ended up selling it in a garage sale, because it was just too large for me</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for quite a while now.  I used it the other day and my curls looked great.  As soon as I showered chunks of hair were falling out.  My hair was burned and it smelled like it too.  It also felt like hay.  I had to cut the area I curled completely.  Don&#x27;t ever buy it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. Nothing special. Curls my hair but my hair doesn&#x27;t hold curls real well.  It&#x27;s a little bit hard to handle considering it&#x27;s so bulky but overall, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> My first 1.5 inch curling iron was a bust so I went for the more expensive one (TIGI) and this one works great!  I love the easy on and off button and the adjustable heat dial.  It heats up quick and stays hot for a good length of time.  I have long hair and I can use it all in one shot with just one 30 second wait for the iron to maintain the highest setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This curling iron is more expensive but it&#x27;s worth the price with it&#x27;s work horse and uniform performance in every day use.</li>
    <li> I bought this curling iron because It&#x27;s Tigi, unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t curl well and it isn&#x27;t hot enough! The curl fell right out which is unusual for my hair. I&#x27;m very disappointed with this iron and it is a crappy product. Spend a little more on a good iron. I do not recommend this one!</li>
    <li> Just had my hair styled in Seattle, my daughter has this curling iron and Loved the results. I intend on purchasing this exact one. Very Happy with the results.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t the absolute most amazing curling iron out there, but for the price, it&#x27;s fantastic.  This is my second Bed Head Curling Iron and I&#x27;ve been just as pleased as I was with the first.  It heats up quickly, curls my hair quickly, and it lasts.  I&#x27;ve invested in an expensive straightener and an expensive hair dryer, but for some reason I just can&#x27;t justify going for a $100+ curling iron.  And it&#x27;s possibly because this curling iron does such a great job that I can&#x27;t imagine needing anything more.  For the price, it&#x27;s hard to argue!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t hold much of a curl. I&#x27;ve had it a while and don&#x27;t use it. It looks nice thought. :)</li>
    <li> Great curling iron! I bought it with the matching blow dryer and it&#x27;s so beautiful! Have had it for 8 months now no issues at all. Use it everyday!</li>
    <li> This is a great curling iron!</li>
    <li> I have extremely thick, somewhat curly hair. I recently decided to cut 8-10 inches off and go with a shorter style. I have used a straightener before but didn&#x27;t want that flat, pin-straight look. I had hoped this curling iron would smooth the waves and curls out of my unruly hair while still allowing me to curl it in towards my face at the ends...and it works perfectly! Everyone tried telling me I needed a straightener but I am very glad I didn&#x27;t listen. I love my new style and my new curling iron!</li>
    <li> I bought it, it died...got a new one and it is dead now!  I guess I need a different brand?</li>
    <li> I wish I could give it 0 stars.  It stopped working after 3 months.  It made a scary popping sound and died.</li>
    <li> I have the 1-1/2 inch model and it works really well for my Heat Defiant Wig. I had tried two other curlers in the past and both burned the same heat defiant fibers with a similar setting. I use one to two clicks lower than \\&quot;medium\\&quot; for 15 sec. I also make sure I&#x27;ve spritzed on a thermal protectant spray to the hairt before curling. When I need a different drum size, I&#x27;ll be ordering the Bed Head product.</li>
    <li> what can i say, it works great and the price is right, as good as the expensive ones, the end</li>
    <li> So the curling iron I had used for about 15 years finally conked out. (That made for an interesting day...I&#x27;m sure more than a few small children were scared when they saw me!) I couldn&#x27;t find a large barreled curling iron...unless I wanted to take out a second mortgage. I was nervous about ordering something like this online...but I now realize how silly I was! This curling iron works GREAT! The price was fantastic - I would have paid twice what I did for this thing. My daughter and I love how the sides of the curling iron light up in a futuristic way, ramping up from yellow lights (on low) to green lights (on medium or high settings). This is the same size as the Revlon one I loved for years - heats up quickly, curls well, looks good on my bathroom counter, makes us happy looking at the pink color (and fun lights, when it&#x27;s on), and is void of the sticky build up I hadn&#x27;t realized had built up on my last curling iron. I would definitely buy this again - I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A quick note: Even if you are used to having to use the &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; setting on hair appliances, try out the medium setting first. I was surprised at how hot this actually got.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much I love this curling iron. I ordered it while I wait for my stylist to purchase me a professional curling iron (at a much higher price!) at her next &amp;#34;show&amp;#34;. This curling iron is worth so much more than the price I paid, but don&#x27;t tell Bed Head that or they will raise the price! Plus, I love the colors!</li>
    <li> We had the 1&amp;#34; and loved it so adding the 1.5&amp;#34; was something we wanted to try.  These curling irons are so awesome.  They heat quick and leave your hair shiney and the curls stay in for a long time.  This is the only reason we tried the larger one, because being large if it didn&#x27;t heat right you could be left with no curl.  It makes really nice waves that stay in.  More like a natural fullness and finishes the ends nicely (instead of stiff and dry just after blow drying).  Highly recommend the Bed head products.</li>
    <li> Heats up fast and furious.  I turn my head upside down and pull from as close as I can get to my scalp without burning it.  I spray it first when it&#x27;s wet with a little root lift or boost.  My hair is very lifeless and flat.  This gives me the body I want and then I use anti humidity hair spray when I get it where I want it.  It&#x27;s taken years to find this cocktail.  Hope they do not stop making this iron.</li>
    <li> Bought for a wedding. Used on my hard to curl hair and was very pleased. Also used on my sister in laws thick straight Asian hair and it curled nicely. My sister in law was so pleased she is getting one for herself. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> It takes five inches of hair to wrap around this curling iron once, so if you don&#x27;t have hair at least that long, it probably won&#x27;t work for you. This curling iron is good for an almost straight effect. As with other Bed Head curling irons, they did a good job of putting the control where you won&#x27;t accidentally turn it off.</li>
    <li> Great curling iron for the price it heats up fast and looks great!I love that it lights up. For sure good for the price!</li>
    <li> I really like the styling iron.  It heats up quickly and works well.  I had no problems receiving the iron.  It was delivered the next day.</li>
    <li> I do lots of updo&#x27;s and I love Bead Head styling irons.  They last a very long time and quick heat.</li>
    <li> Great and easy to use. Takes seconds to make curls. Bought the entire collection of bed head curlers. Love it!</li>
    <li> Im not sure if it was the  seller or the product itself but this did not work and was packaged poorly. I put it on a garage sale, still haven&#x27;t got rid of it</li>
    <li> I really like this iron but I gave it a 3 because the screws on the pincher always catch my hair so I lose several strands painfully every time I use it.</li>
    <li> I recieved the product within two days. I am pleased that for the price it works very well.&lt;br /&gt;The product is easy to use and heats up very fast. Not a bad deal for the price.</li>
    <li> its the best curler i have had yet makes the loose curls like i want does perfect for my hair can even get tight curls best curler love it i would rec. this to anyone</li>
    <li> This is not a genuine Tigi/Bed Head iron. They discontinued this model, in this size. The heat level and product quality are not the same as with the original. Do yourself a favor and invest in a more expensive iron. This one does not get hot enough to do the job well.</li>
    <li> i have very thick hair, works but my curls fall out fast. i think i need product to help keep them in. heats up fast!</li>
    <li> Love this iron! It&#x27;s great for nice big loose curls and adds volume and shape to your hair. The curls last. Sometimes just to get a but of body I will flat iron my hair first then curl the iron. I have tried other irons in this price range and this one is by far the best. It gets nice and hot quickly and doesn&#x27;t pull you hair.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it. Gets hot fast and stays hot evenly. Temp control works great. Great Product at a Great Price. My wife said so.......</li>
    <li> Bought the wrong size iron. However, it will be used by the my daughters and myself. Still a good buy for a ceramic iron.</li>
