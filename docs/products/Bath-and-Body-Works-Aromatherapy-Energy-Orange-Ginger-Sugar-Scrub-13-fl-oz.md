<li> Just thought I would give this a try since I like the soap, but not really my &amp;#34;cup of tea&amp;#34;.</li>
<li> The jar is so full of oil it makes it awkward to try and use without dripping oil down your arms.&lt;br</li>
<li> /&gt;It is greasy and the oil is so heavy it makes the bottom of the tub slippery</li>
<li> and it was hard to use.</li>
<li> I gave it four stars because you cannot use it and then shave your legs, because it leaves like a film and it is very hard to shave.</li>
<li> Very disappointed in this product.  </li>

    <li> This is my absolute favorite sugar scrub, not only because of the warm, spicy citrus scent, but the moisture it leaves behind is smooth, and silky. And the feeling lasts for HOURS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A must have for any home spa!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this scrub for 5 years....no other scrub compares. It&#x27;s refreshing and gives you the boost you need in the mornings. I also shave my legs after rinsing it off so I don&#x27;t have to use shaving cream as well.</li>
    <li> I have always liked this one.  Light scent disappears in a while. Really good as a scrub and the oils nicely lock in hydration.</li>
    <li> My favorite body scrub! The smell wakes you up in the morning and the sugar and oils make your skin silky smooth. I use it once or twice a week.</li>
    <li> VERY NICE AND SOOTHING AROMA, . THE SCRUB IS REALLY NICE ON THE HANDS. AFTER YOU SCRUB AND RINCE YOUR HANDS OFF THEY FEEL SOFT AS A BABIES BOTTOM!!</li>
    <li> I never tire of this scrub. It smells amazing and leaves your skin feeling awesome.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in this product.  The jar is so full of oil it makes it awkward to try and use without dripping oil down your arms.&lt;br /&gt;It is greasy and the oil is so heavy it makes the bottom of the tub slippery before you even let the water out.&lt;br /&gt;To use it up I will be pouring some of the oil out of the jar to more easily use the scrub.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this product one star is that it smells heavenly.&lt;br /&gt;I will not order this again or recommend it.</li>
    <li> Good scrub, I like that you can actually feel the grains of sugar as you put in into your skin. Others can barely be feeled. Leaves your skin super soft and moisturized. I gave it four stars because you cannot use it and then shave your legs, because it leaves like a film and it is very hard to shave.</li>
    <li> Greatest sugar scrub there is!!!  period--I always come back to Bath &amp; Body Works sugar scrubs---won&#x27;t try anything else ever again.  The Orange-ginger is awesome!!!!!</li>
