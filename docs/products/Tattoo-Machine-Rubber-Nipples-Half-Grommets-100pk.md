<li> that sold them tattoo xp supplies, they are medium soft and hard, other word they are just right, they don&#x27;t give and move when do your lining work, and I use them coloring and shading, sometimes, but I got some little bit softer ones I use for shading color work so its less trauma and a little give.</li>

I tried to use one in front of a client and had to dip into my old bag which luckily I have a few left.</li>
