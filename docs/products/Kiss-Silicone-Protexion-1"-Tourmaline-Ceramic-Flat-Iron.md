    <li> Worked fine for 2 months then died.  Light would come on but iron would not heat up.  Of course, this was after the Amazon free return period expired.</li>
    <li> Get&#x27;s the job done better than at my local salon! Silicone is way better than full on ceramic. If you&#x27;ve got more money though, get a straightener with more silicone, because the more you have the better it works!</li>
    <li> This works for me. This narrower unit is so much better than those wide ones. It heats up quickly too.</li>
    <li> Fried my hair terrible, I went back to using my old one. Waste of my hard earned money.  Never again!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best flat irons I have purchased.  It does not burn your hair and the shine stays in your hair</li>
    <li> It arrived as anticipated. I used it for a few days. It seemed to be the perfect flat iron. Then the writing on the outside rubbed off and I thought I had received a fake flat iron. Then the red light kept blinking on it so I never knew if it was on or heating up or what. The final straw was when I noticed that the red insert in the plate had elongated and was sticking out beyond the plate. I was able to lift it up and if I wanted to, I could just lift out the entire red line. It was odd. I am returning it for a refund. I really had hoped it would be my dream flat iron.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this flat iron. I&#x27;ve had mine for a year and it has been consistently helping me style my hair time and time again. My stylist always comments on how healthy my hair is despite the high heat I use to straighten it. Use along side HSI Argon Oil for healthy, shiny hair.</li>
    <li> Cheap straightener! Does not protect hair very werll, but works to straighten hair!</li>
    <li> Prior to buying this flat iron I bought a Bio Ionic One Pass from Fantastic Sams and 1) it was WAY overpriced 2) it wasn&#x27;t working properly (seemed like a short in the wiring).  Anyway....I did a little research and came across this one for under $40 to boot!!!  So far this flat iron works GREAT.  My hair is thick and I like that it has a setting for up to 420 degrees.</li>
    <li> I bought this upon recommendation of a friend.  I am absolutely amazed at how fantastic it is.  The first two days that I used this product, I received compliments on my hair from others.  I never got that result from my other straightener! (I have medium thick hair that tends to frizz.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, the cord is awesome!  It is a super, super long cord with a swivel base.  No worries about the cord getting tangled up or having to adjust my grip.  I can see why it was endorsed by a celebrity stylist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that it has an adjustable temperature control and it doesn&#x27;t burn my hair.  I still can&#x27;t believe that this only cost me $25.00.  You won&#x27;t find any better product.</li>
    <li> This is really a great flat iron for the price. I love how the silicone grips my hair and keeps it straight. I have super thick, wavy, and looooong hair so the silicone really helps get it straight the first time I go over a section which saves me time. It heats up fast which is another bonus. My only gripe with it is that when I get to the bottom of my hair it seems to frizz my ends. It might be because I need a trim but my Chi never did that even when I needed a trim. So now I stop right before I reach my ends and then blow dry them with a large round brush. It&#x27;s not that big a deal for me because I like my ends to have a slight curl/bounce to them and in the past have always curled them with the blow dryer anyway. Despite that, I still think its a great flat iron and I&#x27;m happy with the purchase. If it weren&#x27;t for the weird frizzing thing I&#x27;d totally have given it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener! Its the first straightener Ive had that actually gives my hair a more moisturized and less puffy look when I finish. Ive had it for about 3 or 4 years.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS FLAT IRON . Gets my hair straight with two passes</li>
    <li> Omg!!! I absolutely love this flat iron!!! Finally what I&#x27;ve been looking for!!!</li>
    <li> Needed a new one and decided to try something a bit more expensive but not over the top.  The Kiss is great really does the job and only once over the hair and it&#x27;s straight.  So happy I spent the extra on it, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I was pleased woth how hot this gets and it does seem like the strips protect the hair more!  pleased!</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron! It heats up in seconds, perfect when I&#x27;m in a rush. Flattens perfectly! Very happy with this purchase :-D</li>
    <li> I will probably break up with my boyfriend and marry this straightener.  It worked wonders on my thick, frizzy white girl hair. It is also great for curling. Best straightener I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
    <li> The best flat iron EVER! It heats up in lightning speed and makes my hair shiny. The smooth silicone plates are top notch. The price was exceptional. I should probably purchase a spare just for good measure. Way to go Kiss!!</li>
    <li> this straightening hair iron is the best hair iron ive ever got. it is  really worth the price. and i super love it &lt;3</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron because it had many good reviews but it just didn&#x27;t work that great for me. I gave it three stars because the plates would smoke a little bit while on the highest setting (which i need it on for my thick long hair) &amp; would let off a slightly burnt smell. Also it didn&#x27;t glide down my hair very smoothly like my past flat irons would. I wanted to like it but after using it a handful of times &amp; experiencing the same issues each time, i decided to return it. My search continues...</li>
    <li> Has to be in a hight temperature to get hot.</li>
    <li> Love the quality of this flat iron and especially how it performs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a new brand for me that I will remember for other hair styling purchases.</li>
    <li> Ok so I have thick hair!!! really thick &amp; my previous flat iron was doing the job but once I tried this I tossed the other one in the trash. This one makes my hair look nice and shiny (with no product in) &amp; does not make it look thick at all! old flat iron did the job but made my hair still look a little thick not only that it took me 2 hours to straighten my hair! (My hair is about 2 inches above my butt!) Kiss silicone Makes my hair look shiny and not so thick and it takes me 40 mins to straighten my hair! I love it! Double them stars!! :) Get it you wont be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this flat iron. My hairstylist used this flat iron to style my hair, and she recommended that I purchase the same one. I&#x27;m very glad I did purchase it. This flat iron is amazing!! I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great iron! Leaves my naturally nappy hair frizz-free and straight!  No little indention lines across my hair either. Silky smooth! My mom wants one now.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST bang for you buck. This Ceramic Flat Iron is the most amazing flat iron ever. I never thought i would find one for less than 100.00 that worked this good. I did and here it is. work great woth all different kinds of oils. Just flat out a great iron.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many different flat iron&#x27;s including the instyler one &amp; THAT didn&#x27;t even work for my hair. I was happy to discover the Kiss Silicone Protexion OMG!!! this flat iron has done the job! it doesn&#x27;t leave little indents in my hair like other&#x27;s that I have used it just straightens my hair perfectly. I am very pleased with this product &amp; the shipping was very fast as well! I love it!</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron! I have another brand which cost twice as much as this and doesn&#x27;t do half the job. I have African American unrelaxed hair and this iron gets my hair silky straight with no damage. Did I say I LOVE this product!</li>
    <li> a gift for my friend and she says it works great! ;)</li>
    <li> After a lot of research I decided to buy this flat iron and this is by far the best flat iron that I have ever owned.  I definitely recommend it to all.  Great for all hair types.</li>
    <li> This is the first flat iron i have used it and love it. Hair feels soft and straight even on the lowest setting. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this flat iron.  Takes less time than my previous irons, and doesn&#x27;t seem to &amp;#34;kill&amp;#34; my hair as much.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best straightening iron I&#x27;ve used.  The silicone strips on either end help hold your hair for better results.  Would definitely buy this item again!</li>
    <li> A vendor in Vegas wanted to sell us a flat iron similar to this for a lot more money. Although I only use it occasionally, it works great and I didn&#x27;t have to pay a lot.</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever owned.  It shaves a great amount of time off my straightening routine, I love the silicone strips, it makes my hair so soft and shiny.  Heats up very quickly and stays hot throughout.  I have a lot and I mean a lot, of very fine shoulder length hair.  Works perfect!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had a straightener that worked so well. It&#x27;s definitely worth the money. It does exactly what the product claims.</li>
