    <li> My well-used Wahl shaver charger frayed at both ends. I wanted an OEM replacement. This is exactly what I needed and expected. It came ahead of time and at a good value. No problems -- and Housewares really does care about the outcome of your interaction with them. Go with Housewares @ Amazon for your needs. They will do you good.</li>

    <li> thought i was going to have to purchase an whole new clipper because i lost the adapter cord &amp; couldn&#x27;t find one to fit. Then I thought &amp;#34;Try Amazon, they have everything&amp;#34;.  To my satisfaction, they did and at an affordable price.</li>
    <li> The charger lost the ability to make contact with the shaver.The connection surface must have worn out.(red light would not stay on)&lt;br /&gt;Nice to know there are affordable parts available.</li>
    <li> My son&#x27;s friend gave him the Wahl shaver and he purchased the charger cord , and shaver works great ! my son says he love it !</li>

    <li> Works as good as it should.  At least it&#x27;s available when the original breaks or quits working.  Hopefully it will keep working.</li>
    <li> Fair product...  Wear&#x27;s a little to easily  at the point where the wire meets the plug in at the the razor end  But charges quickly and gives good power when corded shaving. (second one).</li>
    <li> It was perfect,  thank you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my 3rd charger, I pack mine w the shaver in a shaving kit. By doing this it cause a short. It wld b nice to be able to pack the cord instead of having to leave it laying around.</li>
