      <li>This holder was easy to install with two screws into the side of my bathroom cabinet and hangs there, out of the way, for easy access.  </li>

      <li>My only option is to return the ring or buy a new hair dryer unless I want to hang the dryer through the handle as others have mentioned, which is not feasible for the spot where I intend to mount it.</li>
      <li>We have a weird little dryer that folds, so I wasn&#x27;t sure it would fit, but</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s probably the last time I&#x27;ve ordered an item that is not sold by Amazon directly.</li>
      <li>I finally don&#x27;t have to deal with my husband putting the hairdryer in random places on the counter top!</li>
      <li>Well, he still does but at least I can put it away quickly.</li>
      <li>My wall is too weak to hold this metal thing on the wall also since I put header on the dryer, it doesn&#x27;t fit on the hole.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

<li> Its annoying to put the head back and forth.... not worth it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love this wall mount, which I use for my blow dryer. I&#x27;ve been wanting one for my bathroom ever since seeing a similar one in a hotel in Berlin last summer. It keeps the blow dryer handy while freeing up counter space, making the area look much more tidy. Absolutely wonderful! (note: I purchased the right-hand mount)</li>
    <li> My wall is too weak to hold this metal thing on the wall also since I put header on the dryer, it doesn&#x27;t fit on the hole.&lt;br /&gt;I have to take the head out than put it in.  Its annoying to put the head back and forth.... not worth it.</li>
    <li> The photo is misleading regarding the size of the holder. My hair dryer is not very big and still didn&#x27;t fit. The only reason why I took the risk of ordering it was because I thought I could return it.  I did not expect, though, that I would have to pay for the return. Indeed, I chose to order the item because it had free shipping. Why should I know I would have to pay to return?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not the kind of service I have come to expect from Amazon and it&#x27;s probably the last time I&#x27;ve ordered an item that is not sold by Amazon directly.</li>
    <li> I use it to hang hair dryer on wall below my small vanity - love it, instantly fixed annoying issue with wear to put the hair dryer on a small counter.</li>
    <li> The hair ware worked out great for me. I have very little bathroom counter space and I did not what my blow dryer in the way. So now it is very handy to get at and is not in my way. The down side it does not work for every blow dryer and it is not pretty on the wall.</li>
    <li> It works.  Keeps the dryer off the counter.  It&#x27;s very solid.  We have a weird little dryer that folds, so I wasn&#x27;t sure it would fit, but yay!  It would have gotten five stars, but there were no screws included.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a wall mount hair dryer, but came across this, no need to buy a wall mount, saved some cash in purchasing this. It sure beats getting the hair dryer out and putting it away every single day. It is perfect. Love it..</li>
    <li> Perfect! Many of my friends want to get one as well!</li>
    <li> Super sturdy! The last dryer mount I bought was plastic and broke very quickly, even melted in some areas.This mount is awesome!</li>
    <li> does exactly what I wanted...holds the hair dryer out of place on the wall or on the side of the cabinet.</li>
    <li> It will not hold our hair dryers unless it is mounted vertically. It will not work at 45 degrees as shown.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I bought this! It makes my life so much easier when getting ready in the morning, I actually use it to hold both my hair dryer and my straight iron both, the 1&amp;#34; straight iron fits perfectly over the straight part before it curves and really declutters the counter top.  Great design and functionality at a very good price.  Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This this is STURDY. I put my hair straightener in it when I&#x27;m done using it so that I don&#x27;t accidentally break yet another straightener. Works perfectly although it may be a bit large for what I&#x27;m using it for.</li>
    <li> Love this! Looks great.</li>
    <li> Would have liked more pictures to describe the left/right mounting. I mounted on the right side of the base cabinet, but needed the left wall mount.</li>
    <li> AS PROMISED. FAST SHIPPING. EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED</li>
    <li> simple design. gets the dryer out of the way</li>
    <li> Cool design and nests the blow dryer with ease. Gets people&#x27;s attention and everyone else now wants one - lol!</li>

    <li> This is the best thing ever works great</li>
    <li> great product, sturdy,everything it advertised except was not a left side mount.  was right side.</li>
    <li> Made very study and heavy.  I ordered the &amp;#34;left&amp;#34; mount which would have been perfect when mounting on &amp;#34;your left&amp;#34;.  The reason for not giving it 5 stars is because it is not big enough.  I have what I consider a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; sized hair dryer and the narrow end will not fit through the last ring causing the hair dryer to fall out.  My only option is to return the ring or buy a new hair dryer unless I want to hang the dryer through the handle as others have mentioned, which is not feasible for the spot where I intend to mount it.</li>
    <li> This design actually works pretty well! I finally don&#x27;t have to deal with my husband putting the hairdryer in random places on the counter top! Well, he still does but at least I can put it away quickly.</li>
