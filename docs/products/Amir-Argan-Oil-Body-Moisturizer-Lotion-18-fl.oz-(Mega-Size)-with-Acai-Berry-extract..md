    <li> love love love love love love this product!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;This product is so wonderful, I hope this product will always stay around so I came keep buying it</li>
    <li> Amir Argan Oil Body Moisturizer Lotion 18 fl.oz -   I was looking for a good oil-based lotion for my extra dry skin, I have tried many, many products and was not having much luck but to my surprise it is very good.  It also came with a \\&quot;free\\&quot; travel size which is good for my purse and the fragrance is not bad either.  (ASIN:B004MAO6NQ Amir Argan Oil Body Moisturizer Lotion 18 fl.oz - (Mega Size) with Acai Berry extract. Receive a FREE 2oz Travel Size]]</li>
    <li> I love the smell and the feel of this lotion..</li>
    <li> LOVE, LOVE this moisturizer! I used to have chicken skin on the back of my arms and on  my thighs!! SOO soft now and love the scent but not overpowering, goes away within the hour which is great!I Love this product and will continue to buy it!</li>
    <li> I was first attracted to this body lotion because it contains argan oil. Then I fell in love with it because the smell is delicious and it left my skin really soft.  After continuous usage, I also noticed an improvement in the appearance of my skin, especially my thighs and legs.  This price is great too, it sells for much more on other sites.  This seller is great also, I received my order in a just a few days !!</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and this product has turned my skin from dry scaly to soft and supple. I recommend this to anyone as my significant other has found it to work well for his hands and has had problems with cracking skin at the top of his fingers Amir has rendered this problem for him. Buy it you will not be disappointed. Amir Argan Oil Body Moisturizer Lotion 18 fl.oz - (Mega Size) with Acai Berry extract.</li>
    <li> I like it so far just received it yesterday</li>
    <li> I live in a cold climate and the winters are just killer on my skin. After using this lotion for only a week my skin feels and looks great. Great for use on your whole body and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy or slippery residue</li>
    <li> I love the smell and the way it feels! I would recommend buying. I generally get Victoria&#x27;s Secret lotion but I really like this stuff.</li>
    <li> Smells great and hydrates.  What more can I ask for.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff! Gets rid of the scaly marks on belly and arms. Feels rich but doesn&#x27;t leave skin feeling greasy. I&#x27;m on my second bottle and will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> I bought a 2 ounce bottle at a local salon while getting a service done there, and I&#x27;m so glad that I did.  This lotion does leave my skin feeling soft, and it smells sooooo good.  Very beachy.  I usually use organic lotions, but I love the smell of this so much.  It does not smell synthetic.  I wish they would come out with a trial size of the tanning lotion as well, as I&#x27;d like to try that next.  Definitely a good product.</li>
    <li> Easily one of the best moisturizers I&#x27;ve ever used.  It absorbs quickly into the skin, and is not heavy or greasy - no leaving the skin feeling like an oil slick.  I use this on my face as well as body.  It has a lovely, light, pineapple-y fragrance, somewhat like Paul Mitchell shampoo (very tropical scent).  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> we really like this lotion over the other brands (Hempz lotion)</li>
    <li> This lotion is amazing. It makes your skin feel so silky and smooth without any oily feeling</li>
    <li> this stuff is fabulos. i love it. i can use it and not need to use my perfume.  i love it.</li>
    <li> I purchased Amir Argan Oil because I had tried Moroccan Oil Lotion in another brand that was much more expensive and I wanted to compare the two.  I was delightfully surprised.  I love this velvety smooth lotion and the scent is not too heavy and so sensual.  I am happy to recommend this product to anyone who loves Moroccan Oil products.  You will be plesantly surprised!</li>
    <li> Love this body lotion - very lush and creamy. I think it will keep my skin moist through the winter. It also has a nice scent, not too intense, just a fresh light fragrance. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Smell too strong even though the lotion works well.</li>
    <li> Love this product. A little bit goes a long way. I have a cleaning business and my hands really take a beating but since I have been using this I see a noticeable difference. My hands are much smoother. It&#x27;s worth the money and I would definately come back for more.</li>
    <li> Smells good and is a good moisturizer. I live in Iowa and it is currently 2 below zero. I need a good moisturizer during the cold winter months and this one works just fine.</li>
    <li> Great product and even a great price compared to Salon products.</li>
    <li> Great product. Fragrance is light. Moisture lasts all day. Gentle enough for kids out those with sensitive skin. Will buy more!</li>
    <li> I just received this from the UPS man yesterday.  I wasted no time in lathering myself and must say am impressed with the product.  It is, as other reviewers have said, non-greasy and very hydrating.  It immediately absorbed into my skin leaving it feeling moisturized and smooth.  I could see myself using this product regularly IF.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the scent was not so overbearing.  I do like the fragrance A LOT.  It is a pleasant smell, tropical and fruity.  However, it is not a subtle scent.  It does not wear off quickly (as I find most scented lotions do) but lingers for hours, permeating through the clothing shield you might have donned to thwart the scents effort to take over your life.  So if you are a person prone to headaches from strong fragrance (as I am) or somebody who likes to wear a particular perfume (as I do) this might not be a lotion for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I must resolve myself to adding a few drops of pure argan oil to an unscented or lightly scented lotion to try to reproduce the hydrating affects of the lotion without the lingering headache it causes.</li>
    <li> Fantastic Product... I use it all the time - I love the way it smells too!!</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer! Love the fragrance</li>
    <li> this smells like heaven - like a Pina Colada!!! It also absorbs into the skin and leaves it feeling silky without feeling greasy. The pump bottle makes for an easy dispersion of the lotion as well. I love that I can use it on my body and face and not feel like it&#x27;s too heavy. What I really adore about this lotion is how long my skin seems to stay hydrated. It lasts even longer if you put it on after a shower or bath when your skin is still moist. I just ordered my second bottle because of how much I loved my first purchase! Customer for life here!</li>
    <li> My mom saw this lotion listed in magazine that she gets and had to have it. I ordered this and had it sent to her house as a surprise. She has not stopped raving about it since she got it. She has been using it nightly on her face and neck. She also said it smells really good.</li>
    <li> This smells amazing, and it moisturizers so well. It leaves my skin feeling so soft. Would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> AMIR  ARGAN OIL IS A HIGH QUALITY LOTION. I WAS PLEASED TO PURCHASE IT ON AMAZON, AND THE PRICE IS VERY REASONABLE TOO.</li>
    <li> The is the best product.  It may not have the highest percentage of Oil as some of the more expensive products, but it really is my choice for keeping the moisture in and increasing softness of the skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s worth every cent.  Smells awesome &amp; leaves your skin smooth &amp; happy.  Thanks Amazon for the amazing deal &amp; fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  Keep my skin soft without feeling greasy.  I will order again.</li>
    <li> Love this product, found it in the salon I frequent decided to buy some for myself.  No regrets at all!</li>
    <li> Live in CA so we have a low humidity. This lotion is not greasy or sticky, it goes on easily &amp; lasts all day--no itchy or dry skin that needs more lotion.&lt;br /&gt;The product picture showed a small purse size lotion that would be great for hands, but it did not come with my order. Last time I ordered it I received the small carry bottle. Very hard to refill.&lt;br /&gt;Nice light fragrance that won&#x27;t overwhelm perfume. I like products with argon oil &amp; was glad when I found this without an enormous price. Will keep buying it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  Amir Argan Body moisturizer lotion absorbs into your skin thoroughly, leaving the skin feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
    <li> very good product&amp; i will order it again when I need it, I would recommend this product,its very good&lt;br /&gt;  thank you</li>
    <li> The cap loosened during transport and it arrived very messy. Otherwise, all good.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast, and everything was as advertised. This was a gift for my aunt for Mother&#x27;s day and she loved it. She said it smelled great and was very nice.</li>
    <li> The argan oil bottle moisturizer was advertised with a travel size bottle, I did not receive the travel size bottle.</li>
    <li> Its great moisturizer; love the ingredients; kind of pricy.</li>
    <li> My dry hands look so much better!</li>
    <li> Smell good great product</li>
    <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this lotion! Its luxurious, smells fabulous, and your skin is so great! I highly recommend to everyone!!!</li>
    <li> The strong scent makes this product difficult to use if you have any sense of smell. The aroma is reminiscent of cheap, baked, coconut-y suntan oil.</li>
    <li> I love the Amir Argan products - have had great results with the lotion, along with the shampoo/conditioner. delivered as promised!</li>
    <li> This is a nice medium weight lotion that has a nice (but fairly pronounced) coconut smell.  I use Argan Oil and figured I&#x27;d give this a try as it contains the oil.  SInce lathering Argan Oil over your whole body isn&#x27;t really pratical I figured this would be a good vehicle for larger areas.  I don&#x27;t think it has near the efficacy of the straight oil, nor have I thought it much better than other quality lotions, but it is a good medium weight non-greasy lotion that has a good smell, if you like coconuts.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this lotion.  It is not greasy and has a pleasant odor.  I used it on the toughest part of my body, my heels.  Within a day or two, it was softening up my feet.  The lotion is beginning to reduce the wrinkles on my hands and neck.  I am in love.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  Someone gave me a bottle as an end-of-year teacher gift and now I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> Very pleasant smell. So much so that I look forward to applying it just for the scent. At the end of the day, it is just lotion. So it&#x27;s a bit pricey.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice product.  Had tried it at my hair salon and they had it priced much higher.  It is not oily or greasy.  Soaks into the skin making you feel soft and hydrated.  The smell is very tropical like a suntan lotion which I am really enjoying in the summer.  I really like how the smell covers my spray tan smell and since spray tan can be drying it also helps with that too!</li>
    <li> My favorite.Totally absorbs after 5 minutes..leaves hands soft with no oily trace or residue.The Best Value for the money.</li>
    <li> A very nice lotion. It has a nice smell too.I can&#x27;t handle perfumes so its a gamble for me to get oils (which are usually good).  Creams etc can smell terrible but this one is wonderful. I love Moroccan oil for my hair.. its a winner.. the smell and how it makes the tangles go away for my long hair is amazing.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer brings back memories of using Hawaiian Tropic suntan oil in the late 70&#x27;s.  Heavily coconut scented, this may interfere with any perfume you would want to wear as the scent lasts about 3 hours (on ME)-but it may not on YOU as we all have a different body chemistry.  Since this has such a beachy scent, I limit my use of this to Spring and Summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though it&#x27;s called Argan Oil Moisturizer, argan oil is #8 on the list of ingredients; the acai berry extract is way down on the ingredient deck.  I have dry skin and this leaves me feeling moisturized all day.  Good ingredients for the most part: several oils such as sesame, jojoba, and tea tree (the coconut overrides the tea tree odor which is a good thing).  High levels of Vitamin E.  This also contains parabens which some people want to avoid.  Made in the USA and no animal testing which ranks high in my book.</li>
    <li> I like this lotion.  I bought the lotion and the body wash for the shower.  The reason I gave it a 4 star was the pump on both containers would not work.  I happened to have the pumps from other containers that fit so I replaced them.  The company needs to get pumps that work for their products.  I would have had to return them it I had not had substitute pumps.</li>
    <li> Nice smell. Doesn&#x27;t really do what I was expecting but I like the smell and it is not greasy.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Wish I could find it in Oklahoma City so that I don&#x27;t have to order it.</li>
    <li> very light and smooth, does not leave a sticky residue</li>
    <li> I love this Product.. I would strongly suggest you try it  It is well worth the money and once you have tried it you will not use any other...  Its the Best!</li>
    <li> A friend recommended I try this product.  It is better than she said.  I love how it makes my skin feel and look.  People think that I am 10 years younger than I am and my skin looks it.  Great product and I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> it smells great and feels great</li>
    <li> Good stuff. All I got to say. I should be able to use as many words as I like, so therefore YOU are causing a bad rating MAKING me write more than I like.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this lotion!</li>
    <li> I ordered this after my hair professional advised it and it&#x27;s got a great texture but the odor of coconut oil is a bit over-the-top.  I tend to use something else and regret spending so much on this..</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because the product I recently purchased, was all I expected and more. I will recommend this.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion I have ever used. I am allergic to many perfumes and lotions, but not this one, even though it has a nice light fragrance.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily say that it is completely non-greasy, but it is adequate and contains a very nice, effective variety of oils, including tee tree oil, which has efficiently reduced any inflammation on my skin (bug bites, acne, wounds, etc.). It smells more like coconut oil than anything else</li>
    <li> I love it! I don&#x27;t know what would do without it! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Best Moisturizer made</li>
    <li> This Is the best skin moisturizer I have ever used! Not oily, clean fragrance!!</li>
    <li> John seldom uses moisturizer so he turned the keyboard over to me to say a few words about Amir Argan Oil.  To say that I appreciate it and regret not having use of it years ago is an understatement.  A dental assistant was helping clean my teeth and while getting ready, she suggested that my account card might have an error on it.  &amp;#34;I just read your card and it suggest a much older age that what you look like.  Did you make a mistake when filing out the form or did we?&amp;#34;  &amp;#34;No, your records are accurate.  I am very lucky and just got lucky.&amp;#34;  I wanted to say it is because I use Amir; however, I cannot prove that Amir takes away all those little wrinkles and even the massive ones too.  Amir is just a good moisturizeing Lotion and I appreciate it.</li>
    <li> this is a wonderful lotion, and it has a sweet nutty smell that i love.a little more than i would like to pay for lotion, but the size of the bottle will last a long time. im glad i bought it.</li>
    <li> This feels wonderful and has a great scent. My husband even likes using it - not too feminine. Great deal too.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, good price...I love this lotion! :)</li>
    <li> Very thin for the price</li>
    <li> With so many oils as ingredients and with coconut oil being the main ingredient, I&#x27;m not sure how Amir can call this product argan oil.  It&#x27;s a wonderful moisturizer and and absorbs quickly.  I have what I call chronic dryness on my legs and have been through almost every lotion on the market including medicated. Usually, those products leave a lot to be desired and rarely moisturize pass 30 minutes if at all. Amir Argan Oil moisturizes all day with not as much product used.  My only issue is the smell.  It smells like a tropical vacation.  The only good thing about it the smell is that it dissipates fairly quickly and does not interfere with perfume.</li>
    <li> The lotion was fine.  I just spent too much on it.  After ordering it, I saw it at Marshall&#x27; s for a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> Only moisturizer I use.  Even have friends using it.  The best.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful lotion, it feel good to your skin and last longer than others. I have reccommended to my friends.</li>
    <li> I found it very moisturising for my hands and face.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;I also like the smell.</li>
    <li> This lotion has exceeded my expectations! The beautiful aroma makes me feel like I&#x27;m at seaside even though I&#x27;m working. I will definitely be purchasing this again!</li>
    <li> Excellent moisturizer....wouldn&#x27;t be without it.  Use it for my face as well!  Just as good if not better than the expensive facial moisturizers.  Not greasy and absorbs well.  Have recommended it to my friends.</li>
    <li> Smells lovely, penetrates the skin and moisturizes this 54 year old skin very well. Beats any drugstore brand and is the best &amp;#34;designer brand&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I love this as it leaves my skin feeling smooth &amp; soft. Plus it smells wonderful! Would recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> Great product.  I am glad I researched this and ordered it.  Very satisfied with the product and service. I LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> It was not anything close to what was described. In my opinion this product is way too hyped up. When I received it I used a tiny bit to test it out and got sever headache because of its smell. Also it&#x27;s water based - very less moisture.  I shipped it back immediately. Lastly, if you are sensitive to smells like me then this is not for you.</li>
    <li> Been using this forever. Wonderful stuff, will never change.</li>
    <li> Very good body lotion!!!! Not greasy and it smells very nice. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Curel is a better lotion at one third the price.  The coconut scent is very strong, goes on thick, and doesn&#x27;t moisturize.  The acai berry didn&#x27;t irritate my skin but did a member of my family.through it like water)&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0050AXHQ4 Josie Maran Whipped Argan Oil Ultra-Hydrating Body Butter Sweet Citrus 8 oz]]</li>
    <li> All of the Amir products I have used have been great - no stickiness or oiliness left behind after they are applied and they leave my skin feeling great. BUT, I find the smell is almost overpowering, so much so that it interferes with my cologne. And the smell stays with you and does not wear off over time. If they could fix the fragrance problem, I would give these products 10 stars.</li>
    <li> My wife and I love this product, and we are letting others know about it. Thank you, and we will be order more</li>
    <li> I am not a big fan of lotion.. I never really have been but lately my skin has been quite dry due to winter. I decided to buy this and I absolutely love it. Only thing I am not a fan of is the smell.. it smells a tad bit like tanning lotion (to me) but I still use it cause I love the way it feels. It dries on my skin very fast and is not oily at all. Def recommended!</li>
    <li> The lotion has an overpoweringly sweet scent. Thin consistency, applies easily and sinks in quickly. I did not find it to be long-lasting.</li>
    <li> nice ! absorbs quickly-smells good-</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for over a year. I love it &amp; the value offered online was far better then in stores in my area.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and price, super fast delivery.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I received a small bottle from my hair dresser and loved it. it helps with shave bumps on men and women, it soaks into the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feeling or residue. The fragrance is light and I keep a small bottle in my glove compartment. My hands/body feel silky and moisturized all day. It&#x27;s safe for all ages and can soften skin and lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Amazing lotion!! Instantly absorbed by skin. Not sticky or watery.</li>
    <li> The lotion works well on my skin and the fragrance smells good. and keep moisture condition of skin. would recommend</li>
    <li> I bought this when it was on sale and its amazing. I can&#x27;t stop smelling my hands. It&#x27;s really moisturizing without it feeling cakey or oily. I was originally buying this as a gift, but I loved it so much, I&#x27;m going to have to buy another one, lol. :D</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  My skin is SOOO dry and after a shower, put this all over and no more dry skin worries!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for my extra sensitive skin also.</li>
    <li> The scent is very pleasant. Excellent moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really hydrate my dry skin</li>
    <li> this lotion is sooooooooo awesome and the smell is spell binding ... so soothing and not greasy ... once you try it ... you will want more ... i love to give this as a gift also !!</li>
    <li> My wife was pleased with the Amir Argan Moisturizer which was identical to and 30% less expensive than her hairdresser charged, even after shipping charges.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  I guess we are always looking for a product that makes you say.... OMG ITS AMAZING! That I&#x27;m not getting.  It feels nice and I believe my skin is hydrated!  The smell and the fact that its Argan oil keeps me coming back.  I would say this scent is appropriate for a man or a woman!</li>
    <li> A bit expense but it make you skin silky and prevent your skin from crack and ruff because as a nurse my hands are wash repeated. I will recommend to friend and family.</li>
    <li> This has a beautiful fragrance that is enjoyable and pleasant.  Does not smell fake or overly strong.  It is a nice moisturizer and it works.  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> This lotion is very moisturizing and has a delicious scent. It kind of smells like an indoor tanning lotion, very tropical and sweet, but it is not at all over powering. My only disappointment is that I did not receive the free travel size lotion that was advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Product Update* I have been using this lotion for over a month now and I decided to change my rating from five to four stars because I noticed with continued use that it feels sticky after  I apply it when I get out of the shower. Also, although it has an incredible smell, it is not as moisturizing as I originally thought it to be. I am in Afghanistan where the air is dry and cold so I need more moisture than this lotion offers.</li>
