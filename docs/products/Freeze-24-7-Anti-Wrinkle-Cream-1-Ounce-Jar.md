      <li>Good stuff.</li>
      <li>and it looks good while it lasts too.</li>
      <li>I bought this at Macys, and the sales person was very convincing</li>
      <li>I was very pleased.  </li>
      <li>And I have to agree with what someone else wrote - when using under makeup it makes my skin look so smooth!!  </li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d never gotten those kind of comments before.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Crystal Rose :-)&lt;br /&gt;Florida</li>
      <li>I used to have huge pores on my nose and after using this stuff - they&#x27;re gone!  </li>
      <li>and she was still able to move her muscles where they were</li>
      <li>I use it every day a couple of times a day, and love it.  </li>
      <li>and I love</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS and will always continue to purchase</li>
      <li>Freeze 24-7 is a favorite of mine.  </li>
      <li>The price here is great, and the shipping was really fast.</li>
      <li>It was okay, but the microdermx I used is what totally changed my skin around to beautiful skin.</li>
      <li>I would say it takes off 5 years on her easily.</li>
      <li>And that&#x27;s where I learned that if my wife was satisfied with the product, she would have to PAY FOR IT IN FULL -- and that she would automatically be signed up to receive this stuff monthly.  </li>
      <li>I will stay with the normal products where you see some results, and you skin feels good.</li>
      <li>Cheap packaging;looks</li>
      <li>a few words about a wonderful product......</li>
      <li>Yeah, I can say that comfortably.</li>
      <li>I know we all want quick fixes...</li>
      <li>All it does is settle into the wrinkles, making them more obvious than before, even with moisturiser on top.</li>
      <li>i love it and recomend it highly.</li>
      <li>I definately can see reduction in wrinkles &amp; that&#x27;s worth the money for me.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s worth the try.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 36 yrs old &amp; have had tons of sun exposure, therefore I have many wrinkle in eye area &amp; under-eye circles.</li>
      <li>so far is MUCH Better.....</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t buy more for several months &amp; have really noticed alot more wrinkles.  </li>
      <li>and she was right.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad it only took me $14.00 to try it out wasnt even worth that.</li>
      <li>and I wasn&#x27;t willing to go thru headaches,</li>
      <li>And if she wasn&#x27;t satisfied with it, she would have to return what was left of it</li>
      <li>I love instant!  </li>
      <li>You can usually tell by the packaging if this is a good product.</li>
      <li>But the Athena was absolutely so drying</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>I never realized how well it was really working until I ran out.  </li>
      <li>I think this is one of those products that after you spend that amount of money, you want it to work so much that your eyes deceive you.</li>
      <li>The Freeze 24/7 ad promised a FREE sample, with only a modest mailing charge.</li>
      <li>I was lucky enough to have a saleswoman at Bloomingdales show me how to use it</li>
      <li>After it dries, you can apply a little more.</li>
      <li>The moisturizer makes my skin sooo soft and the targeted wrinkle treatment INSTANTLY makes most of my lines disappear, although they do reappear later in the day.  </li>
      <li>I like much more since it also has products to moisturize that go over their instant anti wrinkle treatment and your skin doesn&#x27;t feel so dry.</li>
      <li>-7 is able to almost immediately wipe away wrinkles and small sags under the eyes, and even some wrinkles and lines around the mouth...</li>
      <li>The moisturizer is no better than my cheap over-the-counter products!</li>
      <li>The scrub is good...but for the price, I could have had several REAL microderm abrasions at a salon!</li>
      <li>but so far, I do like it!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s never stiff or sticky and lasts for hours under or over makeup.</li>
      <li>Clearly, the company is hoping that the people they entrap either wouldn&#x27;t know how to go about canceling the order or wouldn&#x27;t bother.</li>
      <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY on Freeze</li>
      <li>So far, Freeze 24/7</li>
      <li>I recently had an opportunity to try Freeze...not hoping for much</li>
      <li>as soon as I stopped using it I slept like a baby and was back to normal...</li>

<li> as soon as I stopped using it I slept like a baby and was back to normal...</li>
<li> so it was hard to sleep right</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t do anything to the lines, only makes my skin feel dry.</li>
<li> I tried it a second time and didn&#x27;t see any results except for leaving my face very dry.</li>
<li> I know this sounds strange</li>
<li> it doesn&#x27;t do anything no matter how long or often I use it.</li>
<li> I now don&#x27;t believe a single word the enclosed info.</li>
<li> Only after placing the order did I realize that I could scroll down farther.</li>
<li> Total waste of money.</li>
<li> If you have the money to spend and want to look maybe 5 years younger for a few hours then go for it.</li>
<li> It only lasts a few hours on her.</li>
<li> and there is absolutely no improvement whatsoever.</li>
<li> We both felt it was a shame that such an expensive product was so underwhelming in it&#x27;s actual use.</li>
<li> but when I found it on Amazon for $40 less</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t get rid of wrinkles completly but over time it does help them be less noticable.</li>
<li> because during the few days I used it, I had several people at the office tell me I looked tired and run down.  </li>
<li> Some people seem to have trouble smoothing it in, but you just use a little.</li>
<li> Saw absolutely no results at all!!!</li>
<li> ..don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been reading other people&#x27;s reviews and came to one conclusion:  you either love it or hate it!  </li>
<li> Too bad it costs so much and doesn&#x27;t work for longer</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure that it works.</li>
<li> 24/7 no more than three times a week.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve never experienced that before.</li>
<li> It feels like it&#x27;s doing something, but alas it does not.  </li>
<li> But their nasty sales methods don&#x27;t inspire much confidence in their product.</li>
<li> and it gave me a weird skin rash that lasted 2 months...</li>
<li> It does tingle; to the point where it is making me feel ill.</li>
<li> I persisted, and the rep grudgingly promised to cancel my order.</li>
<li> Feel stupid and annoyed that I have thrown away £40.</li>
<li> Feels like cold cream.</li>
<li> I bought this product a fews days before going on vacation and it gave me really bad headaches</li>
<li> but it made me too sick</li>
<li> Was extremely expensive and completely worthless!</li>
<li> This product was worthless!</li>
<li> I also have had terrible luck with Freeze 24/7 products!</li>

    <li> I think this is one of those products that after you spend that amount of money, you want it to work so much that your eyes deceive you. I&#x27;m not sure that it works.</li>
    <li> i have used this for years and it dramatically reduced my forehead creases...for those who dont realize,its not a moisturizer its a \\&quot;wrinkle freezer\\&quot;..i love it and recomend it highly.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY FREEZE 24/7 PRODUCTS!!!! THEY LIE ABOUT RESULTS!  I also have had terrible luck with Freeze 24/7 products! I have tried several for about a month now, and must say, that I have had ZERO RESULTS! The anti-wrinkle isn&#x27;t instant...it doesn&#x27;t do anything no matter how long or often I use it. The moisturizer is no better than my cheap over-the-counter products! The scrub is good...but for the price, I could have had several REAL microderm abrasions at a salon! Do youselves a favor ladies...DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY on Freeze 24/7!</li>
    <li> I love this product! Some people seem to have trouble smoothing it in, but you just use a little. After it dries, you can apply a little more. The price here is great, and the shipping was really fast.</li>
    <li> I have tried the Athena 7 minute lift and then this product Freeze 24/7.... the Freeze 24/7 so far is MUCH Better..... not as drying as the Athena product. They both do very similar things, they do tighten the skin, minimize wrinkles within minutes (don&#x27;t expect wrinkles to all disappear) But the Athena was absolutely so drying and if you use enough to do anything it left a white residue, and lasted maybe 6 hours. So far, Freeze 24/7 I like much more since it also has products to moisturize that go over their instant anti wrinkle treatment and your skin doesn&#x27;t feel so dry. I will edit my review after Ive used it for a while but so far, I do like it!</li>
    <li> This product did not perform for me. I use olive oil based cleansers on my face, so perhaps my products are not compatable with Freeze 24/7.  It caused a bit of a rash overnight on my forehead, and it took three days before my skin recovered.  I passed the product to a friend and after trying it, she tossed it out.  We both felt it was a shame that such an expensive product was so underwhelming in it&#x27;s actual use.</li>
    <li> This product did not make my crows feet and frown lines go away, but it did do something I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on.  I know this because during the few days I used it, I had several people at the office tell me I looked tired and run down.  I&#x27;d never gotten those kind of comments before.  I stopped using the Freeze 24/7, and the comments stopped.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 36 yrs old &amp; have had tons of sun exposure, therefore I have many wrinkle in eye area &amp; under-eye circles. This product has worked great for me at this stage in my life. I definately can see reduction in wrinkles &amp; that&#x27;s worth the money for me. I will purchase this again!!!</li>
    <li> You can usually tell by the packaging if this is a good product.Cheap packaging;looks like it was packaged from someones house.Feels like cold cream. It does tingle; to the point where it is making me feel ill. It doesn&#x27;t do anything to the lines, only makes my skin feel dry.I can actually taste and feel it on my lips because I put some above my lips.Its a con. ..don&#x27;t waste your money. I will stay with the normal products where you see some results, and you skin feels good.</li>
    <li> Was extremely expensive and completely worthless! Saw absolutely no results at all!!! SAVE YOUR MONEY! &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I recently had an opportunity to try Freeze...not hoping for much and that is what I got.  It feels like it&#x27;s doing something, but alas it does not.  How could anyone justify the cost of this product?  I know we all want quick fixes...but this is not it.  I&#x27;m glad it only took me $14.00 to try it out wasnt even worth that. The people on this site that said it worked, must be in their 20&#x27;s.  Save your money for the botox...</li>
    <li> Hello!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a few words about a wonderful product......Freeze 24-7 is able to almost immediately wipe away wrinkles and small sags under the eyes, and even some wrinkles and lines around the mouth...I love instant!  I use it every day a couple of times a day, and love it.  Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Best,&lt;br /&gt;Julie</li>
    <li> I found Freeze 24/7 works great. I use it in the morning and at bed time and my skin looks wonderful. The wrinkles and lines are gone and I will continue to use  Freeze 24/7.</li>
    <li> It was okay, but the microdermx I used is what totally changed my skin around to beautiful skin.</li>
    <li> My wife read about this in some magazine so I bought it for her. Initially I did not think it worked when she used it because I was looking at her wrinkles that are deep set and they did not look any different and she was still able to move her muscles where they were and I thought this stuff was supposed to be like botox. But I did notice as I looked at her something looked a bit different and she looked noticably younger. I thought maybe it was her make up but she assured me she that it was this cream. So I had her put this stuff on without make up and she was right. She still looked younger. It did NOTHING for her deep set wrinkles, but for her smaller lines around her eyes and lips it made them disappear. I think it just fills them or something but it works. It is not permanent. It only lasts a few hours on her. I would say it takes off 5 years on her easily. Yeah, I can say that comfortably. If you have the money to spend and want to look maybe 5 years younger for a few hours then go for it. It works. Too bad it costs so much and doesn&#x27;t work for longer but I suppose the make up you gals wear doesn&#x27;t last forever either and it looks good while it lasts too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been reading other people&#x27;s reviews and came to one conclusion:  you either love it or hate it!  Since you have a money back guarantee I think it&#x27;s worth the try.  Maybe it only works on some skin types.  The moisturizer makes my skin sooo soft and the targeted wrinkle treatment INSTANTLY makes most of my lines disappear, although they do reappear later in the day.  And I have to agree with what someone else wrote - when using under makeup it makes my skin look so smooth!!  I used to have huge pores on my nose and after using this stuff - they&#x27;re gone!  I love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this product a fews days before going on vacation and it gave me really bad headaches And I had the weirdest dreams...I know this sounds strange but it was like I couldn&#x27;t relax my eyes so it was hard to sleep right...That&#x27;s why I gave it 2 stars because it definitely was doing something...but it made me too sick and I wasn&#x27;t willing to go thru headaches, as soon as I stopped using it I slept like a baby and was back to normal...</li>
    <li> I was buying this product from Bliss but when I found it on Amazon for $40 less I was very pleased.  This is a really great product and you don&#x27;t have to pay hundreds of dollars for it!</li>
    <li> I bought this at Macys, and the sales person was very convincing and I was sold because i did see some reduction in the appearance of my lines. however that lasted about 20 mins  I tried it a second time and didn&#x27;t see any results except for leaving my face very dry. Returning!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this forever and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried others like Peter Thomas Roth (http://www.sephora.com/instant-firmx-P271682) and it gave me a weird skin rash that lasted 2 months...(ICK) I&#x27;ve never experienced that before. My Dermatologist did a skin graft and said never to use it again.  She approved FREEZE 24/7 no more than three times a week. I LOVE THIS and will always continue to purchase it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Crystal Rose :-)&lt;br /&gt;Florida</li>
    <li> I would give zero stars if possible. This product was worthless!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It totally relaxes and smooths out the lines between my eyebrows and around my eyes. I was lucky enough to have a saleswoman at Bloomingdales show me how to use it so I knew what to do and when. Either way it&#x27;s working for me. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years.  I never realized how well it was really working until I ran out.  I didn&#x27;t buy more for several months &amp; have really noticed alot more wrinkles.  It doesn&#x27;t get rid of wrinkles completly but over time it does help them be less noticable.</li>
    <li> The Freeze 24/7 ad promised a FREE sample, with only a modest mailing charge. I hit the \\&quot;buy now\\&quot; button, which I assumed was at the bottom of the page. Only after placing the order did I realize that I could scroll down farther. And that&#x27;s where I learned that if my wife was satisfied with the product, she would have to PAY FOR IT IN FULL -- and that she would automatically be signed up to receive this stuff monthly.  And if she wasn&#x27;t satisfied with it, she would have to return what was left of it (postage paid) within a couple of weeks. I feel that this information should have been posted ABOVE the \\&quot;buy now\\&quot; button, and that its placement was intended to mislead customers. Clearly, the company is hoping that the people they entrap either wouldn&#x27;t know how to go about canceling the order or wouldn&#x27;t bother. When I immediately telephoned the company to cancel my order, I was subjected to a high-pressure sales spiel and, eventually, an offer of a longer trial period. I persisted, and the rep grudgingly promised to cancel my order. I haven&#x27;t heard from these people since then, so I assume she did cancel. But their nasty sales methods don&#x27;t inspire much confidence in their product.</li>
    <li> Total waste of money. Feel stupid and annoyed that I have thrown away £40. Have now used it for 2 weeks and there is absolutely no improvement whatsoever. All it does is settle into the wrinkles, making them more obvious than before, even with moisturiser on top. I now don&#x27;t believe a single word the enclosed info. says about so-called independent tester&#x27;s results. It doesn&#x27;t even deserve 1 star. DO NOT THROW YOUR MONEY AWAY.</li>
    <li> Freeze 24-7 is a favorite of mine.  The temporary &amp;#34;uplift&amp;#34; makes the face look refreshed.  Pat a tiny amount on any area you want to de-emphasize.  It&#x27;s never stiff or sticky and lasts for hours under or over makeup.</li>
