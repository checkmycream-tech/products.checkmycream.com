### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>That&#x27;s attractive!</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t smell very good either.</li>
      <li>I have to say this product works great.</li>
      <li>looks more even and beautiful.</li>
      <li>, one star is too many!</li>
      <li>I would say it is a good light weight serum for the under eye area</li>
      <li>The serum used to be more opaque, but is now more creamy as though sunscreen were added to the formula.</li>
      <li>I Have to say, I didn&#x27;t love the product.</li>
      <li>but I couldn&#x27;t say much more about it.</li>
      <li>but I do love the yes to grapefruit Facewash</li>
      <li>I am sure it probably does or they would not keep selling it.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m convinced the more opaque original serum worked wayyy better.</li>
      <li>Im normally a huge fan of yes products</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>Not really that great.  </li>
      <li>nice product and fairly natural to boot</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t work as quick as it says.</li>
      <li>I discovered Yes to Cucumbers facial towelettes and really love the way they make my skin feel, so I wanted to give this product a try.  </li>
      <li>Since this product never really absorbs into the skin (it kind of just sits there like a layer),</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sticky when you first apply it</li>
      <li>This grapefruit Dark Spot Correcting Serum works better than anything I&#x27;ve tried!  </li>
      <li>It has a this really strong syrupy smell that doesn&#x27;t fade away anytime soon and a similar consistency.</li>
      <li>real bummer wish  </li>
      <li>and I really don&#x27;t see any improvements in my skin.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really mind it</li>
      <li>It does absolutely nothing</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t make the spots disappear, but it makes them fade real well.  </li>
      <li>I disliked the texture and smell of this stuff so much that I didn&#x27;t use it for more than a week before throwing it out.</li>
      <li>I like that its natural but the stickness is too much of a nusiance to deal with.</li>
      <li>and it never completely loses its stickiness.</li>
      <li>the pump dispenses too much product so half a pump is more than enough.</li>
      <li>I like it so far.</li>
      <li>It kind of just results in a mess and a waste of both this product and your moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I will definitely recommend it to new users.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for two days mainly for the melasma above my upper lip that I&#x27;ve been fighting 1.5yrs</li>
      <li>I like the smell, but this serum does not dry well</li>
      <li>and I spent a lot of money for dermatologists to help me clear up my face.</li>

<li> I like the smell, but this serum does not dry well</li>
<li> and I spent a lot of money for dermatologists to help me clear up my face.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used this over a year ago and it has gotten rid of the dark spots on my face so far.</li>
<li> There was also a strange residue left on my skin after using it.</li>
<li> I use it twice a day, unless I&#x27;m going to be wearing makeup, then I don&#x27;t use it, as it doesn&#x27;t work well with makeup, dry or liquid.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ll keep trying until it is empty.  </li>
<li> it was  of better  quality :(</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t see any noticeable differences in terms of dark spot correcting.</li>
<li> This product has not lightened the dark circles under my eye to any extent that I can notice.  </li>
<li> So I only use this at night and that is my only real complaint.</li>
<li> My face is noticeably smoother and even, with less visible scars.</li>
<li> Two stars since it didn&#x27;t dry my skin out at least.</li>
<li> The only complaint I have like I believe some other comments address that combined with my daily moisturizer that gets a weird peeling from residue of the product and moisturizers.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little sticky when applying...</li>
<li> However, there is little results.  </li>
<li> if you try to apply a moisturizer, the serum begins to peel/flake and roll up in little pieces all around your face.</li>
<li> Do not purchase!&lt;br /&gt;I tried this over a few weeks</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> I wish to get a refund from this harsh product</li>
<li> Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t say the same for Yes to Grapefruit Dark Spot Correcting Serum.  </li>
<li> It smelled like it had been sitting in the bottle for years and was not refreshing when i put it on my skin.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d buy this again</li>
<li> Left a sticky feeling and the smell was a but weird.</li>
<li> your hard earned money on something that works</li>
<li> I would recommend you at least try it.</li>
<li> No, I would not recommend it to anyone - if I did, I certainly would tell them about the horrible smell - then they could decide.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t really provide any moisturizing effects, but it&#x27;s also TERRIBLE to put on with moisturizer.</li>
<li> Sorry, not very good!</li>
<li> It does have a weird smell...</li>
<li> but this smells soooo bad</li>
<li> This product caused my face a bad rash</li>
<li> but the serum is terrible to put on.</li>

    <li> Not really that great.  This has to be applied morning and at night.  However, there is little results.  I wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this over a year ago and it has gotten rid of the dark spots on my face so far.</li>
    <li> Left a sticky feeling and the smell was a but weird.</li>
    <li> I Have to say, I didn&#x27;t love the product. It smelled like it had been sitting in the bottle for years and was not refreshing when i put it on my skin. There was also a strange residue left on my skin after using it. The only plus is that it has spf so I really only use it when I&#x27;m on vacation.</li>
    <li> It does absolutely nothing and it doesn&#x27;t smell very good either. Two stars since it didn&#x27;t dry my skin out at least.</li>
    <li> nice product and fairly natural to boot</li>
    <li> This product caused my face a bad rash and I spent a lot of money for dermatologists to help me clear up my face. I wish to get a refund from this harsh product</li>
    <li> I like it so far. I&#x27;ve been using it for two days mainly for the melasma above my upper lip that I&#x27;ve been fighting 1.5yrs (looking like you have a mustache is a killer of any confidence). I&#x27;ve put it all over my face followed by Mary Kay moisterizer and my skin looks more even and beautiful. It does flake off and I don&#x27;t like that... It does have a weird smell... But bottom line it is lightening my &amp;#34;mustache&amp;#34; so I will put up with anything to get these results! I would recommend you at least try it.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as quick as it says. I&#x27;ve been using it for a about 6 weeks and I don&#x27;t see and progress. I&#x27;ve even taken pictures.</li>
    <li> I disliked the texture and smell of this stuff so much that I didn&#x27;t use it for more than a week before throwing it out.</li>
    <li> So far so good. Its been only three weeks since I have been using this product. I definitely see a change in my skin tone - my freckles are getting lighter and my overall skin tone is improving. I have used different products from this line before. I will definitely recommend it to new users.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little sticky when applying... the pump dispenses too much product so half a pump is more than enough. The product tends to pill up if you try to apply a moisturizer after. I recommend you put this product on LAST to avoid that. I like that its natural but the stickness is too much of a nusiance to deal with. I did notice some lightening to my hyper pigmentation, but after awhile I feel like it stop working.</li>
    <li> It hasn&#x27;t lightened my age spots on my hand yet.  I&#x27;ll keep trying until it is empty.  I&#x27;ve been using it about 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> No, I would not recommend it to anyone - if I did, I certainly would tell them about the horrible smell - then they could decide. So-- I can not tell if it works or not. I am sure it probably does or they would not keep selling it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because  have some scars from acne and having staph infection on my face (and yes that was from picking my acne). I have to say this product works great. My face is noticeably smoother and even, with less visible scars. The only complaint I have like I believe some other comments address that combined with my daily moisturizer that gets a weird peeling from residue of the product and moisturizers. So I only use this at night and that is my only real complaint.</li>
    <li> This product has not lightened the dark circles under my eye to any extent that I can notice.  I would say it is a good light weight serum for the under eye area but I couldn&#x27;t say much more about it.</li>
    <li> Do not purchase!&lt;br /&gt;I tried this over a few weeks and I saw no change what-so-ever! Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> This grapefruit Dark Spot Correcting Serum works better than anything I&#x27;ve tried!  It doesn&#x27;t make the spots disappear, but it makes them fade real well.  I use it twice a day, unless I&#x27;m going to be wearing makeup, then I don&#x27;t use it, as it doesn&#x27;t work well with makeup, dry or liquid.  I&#x27;m still using it!!</li>
    <li> Yuck!  Im normally a huge fan of yes products but this smells soooo bad I couldn&#x27;t stand it.  Plus it made my face peel off!  That&#x27;s attractive!</li>
    <li> this product  doesn&#x27;t work it  drys on white  on my face and then starts to peel and has  wired  smell to it .I&#x27;ve only been using the product for two days and that will be the last  time  real bummer wish  it was  of better  quality :(</li>
    <li> If you believe all of this hype, I have some land in china I will sell you also!&lt;br /&gt;Save your hard earned money on something that works, one star is too many!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any noticeable differences in terms of dark spot correcting. Not only that, but the serum is terrible to put on. It has a this really strong syrupy smell that doesn&#x27;t fade away anytime soon and a similar consistency. It&#x27;s sticky when you first apply it and it never completely loses its stickiness. It doesn&#x27;t really provide any moisturizing effects, but it&#x27;s also TERRIBLE to put on with moisturizer. Since this product never really absorbs into the skin (it kind of just sits there like a layer), if you try to apply a moisturizer, the serum begins to peel/flake and roll up in little pieces all around your face. It kind of just results in a mess and a waste of both this product and your moisturizer. As you can imagine, you can&#x27;t wear this if you plan to go out (unless you want to worry about the serum peel) and you DEFINITELY can&#x27;t wear it under makeup. This is probably the only really really big regret I have in terms of buying stuff on Amazon, especially since I bought it when it was twenty-something dollars.</li>
    <li> I discovered Yes to Cucumbers facial towelettes and really love the way they make my skin feel, so I wanted to give this product a try.  Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t say the same for Yes to Grapefruit Dark Spot Correcting Serum.  I have been using it for two weeks now and I really don&#x27;t see any improvements in my skin.  I like the smell, but this serum does not dry well, it does not sink into my skin, and it definitely leaves greasy and slimy residue.  Sorry, not very good!</li>
    <li> The serum used to be more opaque, but is now more creamy as though sunscreen were added to the formula. I don&#x27;t really mind it but I&#x27;m convinced the more opaque original serum worked wayyy better.</li>
    <li> I did notice a difference but it made me break out. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d buy this again but I do love the yes to grapefruit Facewash</li>
