    <li> I received the package unsealed; also the jar was less than half full!!  Not at all like the picture posted on the website.  Would not order this product again due to these issues</li>
    <li> First time I experimented with a facial peeling...my skin feels fresh and renewed!  Highly recommend it for sensitive skin.  Evidently, the Dead Sea salt minerals had something to do with the outcome.  My daughter used it and said &#x27;&#x27;Oh My Gosh&amp;#34;.  I used it and said &amp;#34;FANTASTIC&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> loved it and the price is less than 50% percent of what you would pay at a retail store</li>
    <li> It does clean my face very well !</li>
    <li> make your skin feel young. love it!</li>
    <li> Works very well! It is really gross when all the skin starts peeling off, but it is pretty fascinating! It lasts forever, too. A little bit of this stuff goes a LONG way.</li>
    <li> Well we&#x27;ll heard some people like this product and some not. ..question is everyone&#x27;s skin is different with some it works and some not. ..&lt;br /&gt;Personally myself i love this product.</li>
    <li> I DID NOT LIKEIT AT ALL IT DRIED MY FACE EVEN MORE AND AND THE PACKAGING BROKE THE NEXT DAY I WILL NEVER ORDER IT AGAIN</li>
    <li> love it so much.... my skin look more beautiful and smoth</li>
    <li> I love all the Vivo products. The best thing I have found for my dry skin. I would recommend this to any one with dry skin.</li>
    <li> Gets the dirt! You&#x27;ll notice a different after two weeks of routine usage. I use in conjunction with their facial milk cleanser and man, the difference. Get it!</li>
    <li> This product is great</li>
    <li> This stuff is tries to make you think that it is peeling off dead skin but it is actually depositing some type of glue- like substance on your face that you are peeling off. This is a rip off.</li>
    <li> Very good at renewing facial surface</li>
    <li> I am constantly buying this. I buy two at a time and use this twice a week. It makes my skin smooth and amazing.</li>
    <li> This facial peeling is top notch. I&#x27;ve been using it 1-2 times a week and my skin just glows. It&#x27;s never been so healthy. My son noticed the difference it&#x27;s made on me, so now he uses it, too!</li>
    <li> My husband bought this product for me at the mall. I was shocked by how much he paid ($120.00 &amp;#34;on sale&amp;#34;). So I gave it a try and loved it! So much dead skin came off that I reapplied it two more times. I understand that the clumps are not all dead skin but I can see my dead skin in the clumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product for a week my husband looked at me one morning and told me that my skin looked radiant. I have really bad skin so this was a great complement! I told him how much I loved this stuff and that I hoped it wouldn&#x27;t work so well. I explained that now I have to keep buying this $120.00 product all the time. He had already forgotten he bought this for me and agreeded I needed to buy more. As always, I checked to see if I could buy it on Amazon (I live two hours from the mall). I nearly passed out when I saw it for $10.50 on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered it that day and told my husband about my great deal, he told me that the lady at the mall said the Amazon products are &amp;#34;counterfeit&amp;#34;. So I decided to do a side by side comparison with the mall bought and Amazon bought products. In the back of my mind, I hoped the mall bought product would by better, so my husband wouldn&#x27;t feel swindled by the mall sales lady.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my package arrived I opened it and compared both boxes and jars. They are exactly the same. I applied each to a different side of my face. Both sides reacted exactly the same. The look, feel and smell the same too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sort, do yourself a favor and buy this stuff on Amazon! It really works!!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product much more economical than a product I purchased in the mall with a much larger price</li>
