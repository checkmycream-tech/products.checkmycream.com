      <li>pro-I love this product.easy to use and look like you just come from the nail salon.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t write many reviews</li>
      <li>Nail Bliss&#x27; French Wrap Plus is a wonderful product.</li>
      <li>I look forward to comparing these tips with Incoco&#x27;s for ease of use and endurance but this top coat is number one in my book.</li>
      <li>I thought I had found the holy grail of combinations of polish and top coats..</li>
      <li>take my kids swimming a lot and love baths and have held up great for being in the water so much.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had them on now for well over a week and couldn&#x27;t be happier :)</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>So coarsen the top of your nail before you glue for better hold with your file/buffer, &amp; you may want to carry the nail glue with you.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been over a year, and I still love this product.</li>
      <li>This looks lovely 5 star product.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and gets better every time you use it.  </li>
      <li>an ideal world, it would be super nice to buy each size individually.  </li>
      <li>so drawing on my own smile lines isnt a problem.</li>
      <li>It is easy to apply, there is even an instructional video on the Nail Bliss website.</li>
      <li>/&gt;So easy,</li>
      <li>and although they grow very quickly they always break and split.</li>
      <li>EASY to do</li>
      <li>plus is easy to refinish.</li>
      <li>Easy to grasp, easy to place, easy to glue.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s easy, and it lasts.  </li>
      <li>After about a week, one or two would start to peel off, but it was an easy fix.</li>
      <li>They are on day 10 of wear and the tips/topcoat are still going strong.</li>
      <li>I just keep touching up the top coat because my nails grow very fast</li>
      <li>This is a fantastic product.</li>
      <li>I have been searching for a product that will give me great French nails at home</li>
      <li>and then they just looked unattractive and cheap.  </li>
      <li>I follow up once a week with the top coat and honestly they will probably last me over a month or more.</li>
      <li>but she experienced her nails turning yellow when she removed them.  </li>
      <li>I found this step to be really important...</li>
      <li>To me they ARE VERY worth the time.</li>
      <li>The video even shows how you can use color to create a unique nail look.    </li>
      <li>I did pay special attention to the corner on application after reading reviews and it paid off I</li>
      <li>I just got these and tried them out right away!</li>
      <li>The company recommends lightly filing the tips of your natural nails with a fine grit nail file, so the wraps adhere better.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  </li>
      <li>so these would be great for special occassions rather than going to a nail salon and great because its your real nail under there, but not good to wear all the time unless you have strong natural nails, which I do not.</li>
      <li>Seriously the best thing ever.</li>
      <li>You get the acrylic look, but without ruining your nails, and the wraps are super cheap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
      <li>Finally someone has thought of everything to get a perfect french manicure!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quick,</li>
      <li>I know everyone is different but for me they are the answer to a perfect french manicure I have been looking for.</li>
      <li>Very easy, and professional looking.</li>
      <li>Love this item, like other reviewers have said quick and easy to apply and the outcome is wonderful, even when you first do them with minimal practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I wore them for a FULL 8 days with only having to touch up one corner (carry glue in your purse)to me that is amazing, NO CHIPPING on mine.</li>
      <li>Fast &amp; easy</li>
      <li>/&gt;It really is that easy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also easy to remove when you&#x27;re ready to remove them.  </li>
      <li>Because the French color has a \\&quot;housing\\&quot; you&#x27;re able to apply the glue without getting it on your fingers!</li>
      <li>The top/bottom coat polishes go sticky after a while, but the actual wrapes are amazing.</li>
      <li>I religously do my own nails, usually french manicure.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something to help you get that great french edge, but last a little more permanently than nail polish, and without the incredible cost of salon acrylics, look no further!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried alot of different french nail products and this is by far, the best I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>they come off with pure acetone!</li>
      <li>So easy to do and looks like a professional</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s truly easy to use, and the results look professional every time.  </li>
      <li>They are LIKE tips somewhat but much thinner and more natural than tips.  </li>
      <li>Definitely something to try if you are OCD about your nails like I am :)))))</li>
      <li>I cannot say enough about the top coat.</li>
      <li>I was only able to get these to look great for a week, but they really do look professionally done which is more than I can say for any other at home french manicure products or methods.</li>
      <li>I then align and press the tip to my nail, making sure to press down in the center, and really good on the sides so they don&#x27;t lift up.</li>
      <li>But other than that, this kit is great, I will be using these until I am out of my french manicure phase!</li>
      <li>These look much nicer, don&#x27;t take too long to apply and stay on much better</li>
      <li>They come in black as well, which looks great for Halloween or a specific outfit choice.</li>
      <li>I too have searched for a LONG time for a great french nail manicure without a salon price tag or messing with trying to get the white paint right.</li>
      <li>After 8 straight years of wearing acrylics, I decided to give it up because they were ruining my nails (and costing me a ton of money).</li>
      <li>I feel that the cons are not a deal breaker because overall this technique is easy to use, quick to dry, and better than fidgeting with white nail polish for hours, or paying a ton at a salon.    </li>
      <li>I also apply a coat of sheer plum (orly) up to the white tips, before the top coat.</li>
      <li>I have a steady hand (im an artist)</li>
      <li>Thanks nail bliss, finally a product that is worth the money.</li>
      <li>The outcome of this product is a salon quality french manicure;  it took only about 30 minutes to do and I am so pleased with it.  </li>
      <li>Very shiny and absolutley professional looking!</li>
      <li>Directions could be a little more clear.  </li>

    <li> Easy to apply and look nice.  Directions could be a little more clear.  Also suggest only putting 1 top coat on, otherwise looks too thick.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Love these! I too have searched for a LONG time for a great french nail manicure without a salon price tag or messing with trying to get the white paint right. They have been the perfect soloution and will be a staple in my nail bag. They are LIKE tips somewhat but much thinner and more natural than tips.  I wore them for a FULL 8 days with only having to touch up one corner (carry glue in your purse)to me that is amazing, NO CHIPPING on mine. I did pay special attention to the corner on application after reading reviews and it paid off I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take my kids swimming a lot and love baths and have held up great for being in the water so much.  A bit time consuming took almost 40 minutes but I am getting quicker with each application. To me they ARE VERY worth the time. I did \\&quot;refresh\\&quot; them like the video on thier website said at day 8 and one wrap came off the next day, no biggie to me if you have been around and tried lots of these types of products, ladies you know that is just gonna happen, repair and move on. Perfection is never an option :o) I know everyone is different but for me they are the answer to a perfect french manicure I have been looking for. Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> Easy to use and gets better every time you use it.  EASY to do and you eventually get the hand of gluing the \\&quot;smiles.\\&quot;  This is my fourth manicure and it&#x27;s lasted two weeks!  I just keep touching up the top coat because my nails grow very fast and you can see the new growth otherwise.  Still looks GREAT!!  I LOVE this!!  My nails are naturally hard and this is such a nice alternative to getting gels and regular manicures begin to chip after the first day.  This is a brilliant product.   :-)</li>
    <li> pro-I love this product.easy to use and look like you just come from the nail salon.  con-something the wrap comes off on the edge but i carry my nail glue with me</li>
    <li> these are amazing.  I&#x27;ve actually only used the thin strips, I think the ones selling here are the thicker ones. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever need to visit the salon again.  It looks like i have  gel  tips without any damage to my nails and at a fraction of the cost.  Will totally buy again when i run out</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a product that will give me great French nails at home and here it is.....  Fast &amp; easy</li>
    <li> I spent $30 on the new Shellac manicure and after about one week it was already starting to lift and grow out. I stopped in at my local Sally&#x27;s to buy some Acetone to get the Shellac off and I happened to see these. The lady at Sally&#x27;s said she swore by them and considering they were a fraction of the price I figured why not. Am I glad I bought them! Seriously the best thing ever. I like to do my own nails and although they grow very quickly they always break and split. With these I don&#x27;t have to worry about it. I&#x27;ve had them on now for well over a week and couldn&#x27;t be happier :) So far they haven&#x27;t shown any signs of wear and thats with doing dishes, cleaning, scrubbing floors etc. Definitely something to try if you are OCD about your nails like I am :)))))</li>
    <li> I did it perfect the first time. Simply read the instructions and follow them step by step. It&#x27;s as simple as buffing your natural nail, apply glue, apply french wrap, place, buff and polish.  They&#x27;ve made it SO easy! Because the French color has a \\&quot;housing\\&quot; you&#x27;re able to apply the glue without getting it on your fingers! Easy to grasp, easy to place, easy to glue.  Finally someone has thought of everything to get a perfect french manicure!</li>
    <li> This is a great product!!! I looove this nail kit. I got it in black and it is sooo easy to do.  I am not great at doing my own nail BUT with this kit it took like 15 minutes and it looked Great! I am so happy i found this product I tried to do other french manicures myself and it looked like crap! This looks lovely 5 star product. I don&#x27;t write many reviews cause I&#x27;m hard to please but I love this kit!!!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my teen daughter who loves french nails but was using glue on nails from the drugstore.  These look much nicer, don&#x27;t take too long to apply and stay on much better but she experienced her nails turning yellow when she removed them.  Not sure if this is a chemical thing or what.  Not sure if I would buy again because I&#x27;m a little picky about chemicals in beauty supplies.</li>
    <li> Love this item, like other reviewers have said quick and easy to apply and the outcome is wonderful, even when you first do them with minimal practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the loss of one star: For me, this does NOT give 10 manicures.  Each of my fingers on both hands are the very same size so I need 5 different sizes for my hands.  There are only 5 tips per size, so per the large tips 2  + one hand applications and same for the thin strips. I guess I could stretch it by using the thin strips on one hand and the thick on the other, getting 5 manicures out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Am I the only one whose fingers are identically sized on both sides?  (ie. both pinkys same size, etc)  I can&#x27;t be alone here!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an ideal world, it would be super nice to buy each size individually.  I&#x27;d only need 5 sizes and wouldn&#x27;t have to toss the rest that aren&#x27;t needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NailBliss - can you consider this at some point??? Please???</li>
    <li> The outcome of this product is a salon quality french manicure;  it took only about 30 minutes to do and I am so pleased with it.  I&#x27;ve tried alot of different french nail products and this is by far, the best I&#x27;ve used.  I just did them, so the jury is still out on how long they will last.</li>
    <li> After 8 straight years of wearing acrylics, I decided to give it up because they were ruining my nails (and costing me a ton of money). I came across these nail wraps at a Sally Beauty Supply store, and decided to give it a try. It&#x27;s been over a year, and I still love this product. You get the acrylic look, but without ruining your nails, and the wraps are super cheap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those wondering, the process is pretty simple, but it does take some getting used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I file and buff my nails ahead of time, then wash my hands to get off any oil and dust residue. The company recommends lightly filing the tips of your natural nails with a fine grit nail file, so the wraps adhere better. I found this step to be really important...I&#x27;ve left this step out before, and found the wraps didn&#x27;t last as long as when I filed my natural tips before applying them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then pick the correct size nail tip, put a little glue on the underside of the wrap, as well as on the tip of my actual nail. I then align and press the tip to my nail, making sure to press down in the center, and really good on the sides so they don&#x27;t lift up. Then just clip off the clear tab and file to your liking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all my nails have tips on them and are shaped, I then apply the base coat to the whole nail (yes, this step goes AFTER you apply the tips...I made the mistake once of applying base coat before the tips went on, and they peeled off within 2 days). After the base coat comes the top coat, and you&#x27;re all set! You could probably do without the base coat, but I honestly feel like it just adds another layer of protection and helps keep the wraps on longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really is that easy. My only slight complaint would be that I wish you could order the sizes individually...I don&#x27;t use half the sizes and it feels like such a waste!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And like other reviewers have said, they don&#x27;t hurt your nails...they come off with pure acetone! They come in black as well, which looks great for Halloween or a specific outfit choice. They also come in thick and thin sizes. I prefer the thick, mostly because I like \\&quot;square\\&quot; nails, and the thick ones allow me to file into the square shape (they come rounded). If I used the thin shape and tried to file down the middle to make it square, there would be no white left!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So easy, and I&#x27;m done within 20 minutes! You can&#x27;t beat it for the price and time it takes! :) Mine usually last about a week, and then they sometimes start lifting in the corners. Every once in awhile, I&#x27;ve whacked my hand on something and the nail tip has broken off in the corner, but that&#x27;s to be expected. If you want to make them last as long as possible, you can use non-acetone polish remover (to remove the base/top coat), and then file the nail tip again and apply a fresh coat of base and top coat.</li>
    <li> I have never written a review on anything, ever. I religously do my own nails, usually french manicure. I thought I had found the holy grail of combinations of polish and top coats.. all orly brand from sally&#x27;s. I have a steady hand (im an artist) so drawing on my own smile lines isnt a problem. the problem is the polish doesnt usually last for more than a few days as I am very rough on my hands. I bought this on a whim.. and I have to say, its AWESOME. Like other reviews I&#x27;ve read, I agree that special attention must be paid to the corners. I sometimes put an extra dot of glue on the corners if they look like they might lift. I also apply a coat of sheer plum (orly) up to the white tips, before the top coat. It turns out so nice every time. Very shiny and absolutley professional looking! My only advice would be to not try to adjust the tips after you place them on your nails with the glue on them, they can smudge a little bit. But other than that, this kit is great, I will be using these until I am out of my french manicure phase!</li>
    <li> I have been tring to paint the tips of my nails. The other day I found nail bliss pro french wraps. I purchased the small set just to try it. It is the greatest!!! So easy to do and looks like a professional did it. I am so please with your product. The wraps soak off within minutes and there are no drilling or glue all over the place. I used to have my nails done at nail shops, but it like to have ruin my real nails and also one of my nails got a fugus,and it made my whole nail thin. It also took about an hour to hour and a half to get my nails done. I am very sick and now I can have beautiful nails without going and waiting. Thanks nail bliss, finally a product that is worth the money. Now if you could do something for wrinkles it would be grate and my life would be better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;atidegirl@hiwaay.net[[ASIN:B0055V62H4 Nail Bliss Thin White French Wrap Manicure Kit]]</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product. It does everything it says it will.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s truly easy to use, and the results look professional every time.  Truly impressive - they really thought of everything. I do use a coat of pink polish (like Essie&#x27;s &#x27;Ballet Slippers&#x27;) over the clear base and top seal - that works great if you like the pink-colored look. I&#x27;m going to try using the gel polish over these to make it last even longer!</li>
    <li> I love french nails and going to the salon to get french gel manicures can get expensive.  Plus the french always chips. These are only $30 for over 140 tips. That saves you hundreds of dollars. I also used the thin tips on my toes and have fabulous feet too! I used the thick french on my nails and they are strong and feel better then any gel, shellac or french manicure I have ever had. They stand the test of time and last a long time. I follow up once a week with the top coat and honestly they will probably last me over a month or more. Don&#x27;t hesitate,  buys these and you will be thankful.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something to help you get that great french edge, but last a little more permanently than nail polish, and without the incredible cost of salon acrylics, look no further! Nail Bliss&#x27; French Wrap Plus is a wonderful product. It is easy to apply, there is even an instructional video on the Nail Bliss website. This product will help you save hundreds from salon nail care.    You will also need just a few items not in the kit, so please watch the video on the Nail Bliss website to find out what you need.    This kit comes with a set of thick and thin versions of this product. I also discovered that there are other colors available such as black tips. The video even shows how you can use color to create a unique nail look.    Pros: French wrap plus is easy to refinish. Just watch the video on the Nail Bliss website(under Products and French Wrap Plus). I enjoy the way the thin tips look, however if you have longer nails there is a thick style option. Lasts well under water.    Cons:  The tips come up at the corner of your nails if you use your hands for naughty things (ex. putting together an iron patio furniture set). So coarsen the top of your nail before you glue for better hold with your file/buffer, &amp; you may want to carry the nail glue with you. Secondly some of your nails will eventually chip as with nail polish, so be prepared to repair and redo nails intermittently. I may try a different brand of glue with the tips to see if that helps this issue. I suppose I am very rough with my hands.    I feel that the cons are not a deal breaker because overall this technique is easy to use, quick to dry, and better than fidgeting with white nail polish for hours, or paying a ton at a salon.    I even use them on my toes... I just clip the small sizes with nail clippers to fit.</li>
    <li> Tried these on the recommendation of my favorite Sally&#x27;s employee &amp; they&#x27;re great! I cannot say enough about the top coat. It not only dries within time stated but was set within five minutes. They are on day 10 of wear and the tips/topcoat are still going strong. I look forward to comparing these tips with Incoco&#x27;s for ease of use and endurance but this top coat is number one in my book.</li>
    <li> for a disclaimer, I am still learning to apply nails and I work in an office so I don&#x27;t believe I am too hard on my nails.  It is frustrating to take that long to apply nails and then have them chip and/or fall off.  I have natural long nails so it&#x27;s not like the tips were used as extensions they were just supposed to protect my natural nails.  I find that if you apply a certain nail hardener that works great and my own nails look better than the tips that were not working out so well for me and it took less time to do this than to apply the tips then paint them.  this last attempt my tips would break on the corners and then they just looked unattractive and cheap.  These did last a little longer than the gel nails but after reading about gel nails i&#x27;ll stick to growing my own out as long as I  can.  (these tips didn&#x27;t last the weekend)</li>
    <li> This kit is GREAT.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  It&#x27;s quick, it&#x27;s easy, and it lasts.  It&#x27;s also easy to remove when you&#x27;re ready to remove them.  Mine lasted a good two weeks.</li>
    <li> I just got these and tried them out right away! It was a little tricky at first but once I got them on, I was thrilled. These are the perfect alternative to manicures. They are durable, easy to use and have a lot of sizes for every nail!</li>
    <li> These work great! Very easy, and professional looking. The top/bottom coat polishes go sticky after a while, but the actual wrapes are amazing. Im a stay at home mom and struggle to keep anything on my fingernails. After about a week, one or two would start to peel off, but it was an easy fix.</li>
    <li> I was only able to get these to look great for a week, but they really do look professionally done which is more than I can say for any other at home french manicure products or methods. Only thing is that after a week they start peeling off and looking rough so I would take them off and redo them, which after the 3rd week left my nails damaged... so these would be great for special occassions rather than going to a nail salon and great because its your real nail under there, but not good to wear all the time unless you have strong natural nails, which I do not.</li>
