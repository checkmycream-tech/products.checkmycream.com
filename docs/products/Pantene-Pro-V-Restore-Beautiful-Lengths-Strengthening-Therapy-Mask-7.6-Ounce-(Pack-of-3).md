### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Awesome.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very impressed with Pantene products and this doesn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
      <li>This has worked the best of all I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>And their shampoos and conditioners are excellent as well.  </li>
      <li>They are truly wonderful.  </li>
      <li>Best Hair mask I have ever used!</li>
      <li>This is an excellent conditioner.</li>
      <li>The Beautiful Lengths line is just not what it used to be.  </li>
      <li>I use one container per week, so the 3 pack works out great for me.</li>
      <li>Definitely a great price</li>
      <li>bonus is the great pantene smell it leaves.</li>
      <li>This product works great.  </li>

      <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
      <li>Using this product is the closest I get to achieving that with the Beautiful Lengths line, but it&#x27;s still not as good as the regular Beautiful Lengths shampoo and conditioner before they changed the formula.  </li>
      <li>I wish it came in a tube, instead of a tub - kind of messy.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>Additionally, I do not use the full line of Pantene Beautiful Lengths products all the time-so you do not need the shampoo and conditioner to get the benefit of this mask.</li>
      <li>This is a very strong conditioner.  </li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>It really smells GREAT- many compliments.</li>

      <li>Great product for deep conditioning!</li>
      <li>My hair was moisturized, silky and shiny and frizz free.  </li>
      <li>When I wash and condition my hair, I expect it to feel clean, sleek, and de-tangled.  </li>
      <li>I loved the above product.</li>
      <li>If you want a true conditioning treatment rather than a silicone coating, try SM masks.  </li>
      <li>The price is excellent for such an instant result product.</li>
      <li>On the first day that I used this hair mask, it already made a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Left my hair nice &amp; silky.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is very close to the original.</li>

      <li>I even got my husband using it on a regular basis and we both love it.</li>
      <li>I still go back to Pantene conditioners and feel that this one is the most moisturizing.</li>
      <li>and I find I can use it daily (not weekly) and love it.  </li>
      <li>I had been looking for a really good conditioner that i could use everyday instead of weekly.  </li>
      <li>I switched to this mask after using the L&#x27;Oreal sulfate free hair masque with less than satisfying results.</li>
      <li>It really has kept my hair strong so that it doesnt break as easily and therefore grows quite fast and long!</li>
      <li>I have very fine, dry hair</li>
      <li>started using the therapy mask and after first use I noticed how much shine and softness it added to my hair.i</li>
      <li>My hair actually looks better when I don&#x27;t use it and just stick to my normal Pantene shampoo/condition/heat protectant-leave in routine.</li>
      <li>my wife has beautiful long black hair.</li>
      <li>Very helpful.</li>
      <li>This is excelent &amp; can use the whole jar</li>
      <li>I am very satified with the panetne line of hair care.</li>
      <li>Who wants waxy hair?</li>
      <li>It smells nice and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling heavy.  </li>
      <li>I wrote to Pantene, and they recommemded a totally different product that sounded nothing like the ingredients in the original</li>
      <li>out - breaking easily - prown to split ends - dry - and damaged ...</li>
      <li>Fortunately, I HAVE found a new product that gives me the results I want and that is L&#x27;Oreal Total Repair 5.  </li>
      <li>Its main ingredients, (PANTHEONAL) is a main ingrdient in floor wax.</li>
      <li>It turns my frizzy fro into cute little ringlet curls, plus it leaves my hair moisturized</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it specially for long hair!!</li>
      <li>The eautiful lengths replenishing Mask really helped my dried out hair to become easy to comb and not break off</li>
      <li>The formula is light enough that it can be used daily, but still effective that when used only a few times a week, there is a marked difference in my hair&#x27;s ability to stay less tangled and more hydrated.    </li>
      <li>It leaves my long colored hair super soft and silky, I highly recommend this item.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair so soft and combable!  </li>
      <li>This product when used once or two times a week makes your hair feel so hydrated, soft, and manageable.  </li>
      <li>it so soft</li>
      <li>and it was quite soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>I really like it and am trying to give it time to do what I need it to do which is prevent damage and prevent future damage.</li>
      <li>As far as I know it works for all kinds of hair types, and I would recommend this to ANYONE.</li>
      <li>It seemed that it was the only thing that could condition my fine hair without weighing it down.</li>
      <li>to look like I just stepped out of a commercial, but it did make my long tangled, fine stranded but still thick hair less tangled and more manageable.</li>
      <li>However, it left my hair feeling greasy and more dull than what I started with!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit more expensive than typical drugstore products, but it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
      <li>I made sure to rinse it out completely but it still left an odd film behind.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My previous hairdresser seriously damaged my hair.  This mask is helping to repair my hair to good health.  My hair continues to improve and soften, while becoming stronger.  I highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> Great product for deep conditioning! I even got my husband using it on a regular basis and we both love it.</li>
    <li> When I tried this out for the first time I was happy with the way my hair felt and how easy it was to comb through. I blow dried my hair and it was quite soft and shiny. Later on in the day my hair got extremely greasy and frizzy and non-manageable. I thought maybe I didn&#x27;t rinse it out well enough. The next day I tried it, my hair felt terrible about an hour after. Today my hair is flat, and not cooperative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only pro is, I have no tangles in my hair. If you get this, I would suggest using it maybe once a week.</li>
    <li> The eautiful lengths replenishing Mask really helped my dried out hair to become easy to comb and not break off and my hair stopped falling out from breakage. I am very satified with the panetne line of hair care. I am using the line of beautiful lengths to help with my severely damaged and fragile hair. It really works!</li>
    <li> I switched to this mask after using the L&#x27;Oreal sulfate free hair masque with less than satisfying results. I did not expect my split ends to be repaired or my hair to look like I just stepped out of a commercial, but it did make my long tangled, fine stranded but still thick hair less tangled and more manageable. It did not weigh my hair down or give it a greasy dark coating. The formula is light enough that it can be used daily, but still effective that when used only a few times a week, there is a marked difference in my hair&#x27;s ability to stay less tangled and more hydrated.    After a few months of use, my hair does look much shinier and still has plenty of volume. Additionally, I do not use the full line of Pantene Beautiful Lengths products all the time-so you do not need the shampoo and conditioner to get the benefit of this mask.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a really good conditioner that i could use everyday instead of weekly.  I have very thin long hair, so split ends tend to be a problem.  This product works great.  I was concerned it would weigh my hair down but, it does not. One thing I will mention if you have straight hair and use this conditioner and then curl your hair, my curls did not stay tight for as long as they usually do.  Either way, its fairly priced and works well.</li>
    <li> This might be one of the worst products you can get for you hair. Its main ingredients, (PANTHEONAL) is a main ingrdient in floor wax. Who wants waxy hair? Call your local salon and ask them to scrape your hair. If you don&#x27;t it will just split more.</li>
    <li> I adore this conditioner. It makes my hair so soft and combable!  The price is fantastic b/c you cannot find this conditioner in my local stores. It lasts a long time, so you may only need 1 tub for 2 mo. or more, depending on how many times a week you use it.  I like to get out of the shower and leave it on for an additional 10-20 minutes on the weekend for some extra TLC for my hair.</li>
    <li> I loved the above product. It seemed that it was the only thing that could condition my fine hair without weighing it down. Left my hair nice &amp; silky. I wrote to Pantene, and they recommemded a totally different product that sounded nothing like the ingredients in the original formula.&lt;br /&gt;This is very close to the original. I wish it came in a tube, instead of a tub - kind of messy.&lt;br /&gt;But all in all, I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My hair is very fine and breaks easily.  I&#x27;ve used this product over the last year and it has helped dramatically.  My hair hasn&#x27;t broken nearly as much, it has grown longer, and it is softer.  Definitely a great price and I personally have found the entire Restore Beautiful Lengths line to be wonderful.</li>
    <li> They stopped selling this at the store so I&#x27;ve been ordering it from amazon for over a year.  It leaves my long colored hair super soft and silky, I highly recommend this item.</li>
    <li> this masque its great,after shampoing and conditoning,I put it on and leave in overnight,I love the way it makes my hair feel so smooth,soft and shinny.I highly recommend it specially for long hair!!</li>
    <li> At first I really liked this treatment.  It left my hair soft and silky and it looked and felt very healthy.  However, after using this mask for several months (once a week or so) I noticed that my hair was unresponsive to styling and it was frizzy and dry.  So I switched shampoos.  But this did nothing to alleviate the problem.  So I used a clarifying shampoo and the difference was like night and day.  So I went back to my usual routine, which of course included this mask.  And the same thing happened.  So I quit using the Pantene mask.  I decided to investigate the ingredients and discovered that it is nearly all silicone and wax, which coats the hair shaft making it impossible for any beneficial conditioning ingredients to penetrate the cuticle..  UGH!!  So I started using Shea Moisture Manuka Honey mask instead (only at Target).  And what a difference!!  My hair was moisturized, silky and shiny and frizz free.  And SM contains no silicone or paraben (wax) so the hydrating honey and oils actually do penetrate the hair shaft.  And it doesn&#x27;t build up at all.  It&#x27;s thick and rich and I only need a small amount for my below shoulder length hair.  And there is a SM formula for every hair issue.  SM is available at Walgreens, CVS, Target, Ulta, Sally&#x27;s and Walmart.  It&#x27;s a bit more expensive than typical drugstore products, but it&#x27;s well worth it. And their shampoos and conditioners are excellent as well.  Plus, SM is an all natural product line and is cruelty free.  What more can you ask for?  If you want a true conditioning treatment rather than a silicone coating, try SM masks.  They are truly wonderful.  I definitely don&#x27;t recommend this Pantene mask.</li>
    <li> My go-to conditioner to get the tangles out of my hair, which is quite fine. Keeps my hair the healthiest of any product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Best Hair mask I have ever used! It really has kept my hair strong so that it doesnt break as easily and therefore grows quite fast and long! I would recommed it to all!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent conditioner. My hair especially the ends was very dry.  This is a very strong conditioner.  Very helpful.</li>
    <li> my hair was dry and damaged from yrs of coloring. started using the therapy mask and after first use I noticed how much shine and softness it added to my hair.i now use it twice a week. and couldn&#x27;t be more happy with results,it feels like silk.&lt;br /&gt;a bonus is the great pantene smell it leaves.</li>
    <li> HELLO! Okay so I know people don&#x27;t usually listen if there&#x27;s only one or to bad reviews but LISTEN UP!!!! Panteen is one of the worste brands for your hair!! I have done so much research and asked many  Hair  stylist AND LET ME TELL YOU  panteen is so bad for your hair!! IF YOUR WONDERING WHY YOUR HAIR IS -falling out - breaking easily - prown to split ends - dry - and damaged ... TAKE A LOOK IN YOUR SHOWER AND MAKE SURE THERES NO PANTEEN!</li>
    <li> Im a caucasian female with naturally curly thick hair-which is always dry, overprocessed, and fried from straightening.  This product when used once or two times a week makes your hair feel so hydrated, soft, and manageable.  The price is excellent for such an instant result product.</li>
    <li> Best deep conditioner there is.  Please Pantene do not stop making it.</li>
    <li> Great conditioner, leaves hair very manageable.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I have long hair because of it. I use it as a leave in conditioner. I always get compliments on my hair.</li>
    <li> On the first day that I used this hair mask, it already made a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels much smooth now and I didn&#x27;t have an oil problem as some other people who bought the product did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I think it helps dry hair a lot.</li>
    <li> Typical. Good product.</li>
    <li> This product is just OK.  The Beautiful Lengths line is just not what it used to be.  When I wash and condition my hair, I expect it to feel clean, sleek, and de-tangled.  Using this product is the closest I get to achieving that with the Beautiful Lengths line, but it&#x27;s still not as good as the regular Beautiful Lengths shampoo and conditioner before they changed the formula.  Fortunately, I HAVE found a new product that gives me the results I want and that is L&#x27;Oreal Total Repair 5.  Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo: http://www.amazon.com/LOreal-Total-Repair-Restoring-Shampoo/dp/B00AF9DGMA/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1367343326&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;loreal+5&lt;br /&gt;Conditioner: http://www.amazon.com/LOreal-Total-Repair-Restoring-Conditioner/dp/B00AF9D4JK/ref&#x3D;sr_1_3?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1367343326&amp;sr&#x3D;8-3&amp;keywords&#x3D;loreal+5</li>
    <li> my wife has beautiful long black hair. she puts this on her wet hair after a shower and it makes her hair shine and maks it so soft</li>
    <li> Was buying this in a tube that would collapse &amp; not allow me to get it out-- that&#x27;s hard when wet &amp; in the shower- wasted alot w/ the tube. This is excelent &amp; can use the whole jar w/out wasting. It really smells GREAT- many compliments. I will definitley buy more</li>
    <li> I was expecting a lot from this product, based on the other reviews. However, it left my hair feeling greasy and more dull than what I started with! I made sure to rinse it out completely but it still left an odd film behind. My hair actually looks better when I don&#x27;t use it and just stick to my normal Pantene shampoo/condition/heat protectant-leave in routine. My hair is thick too - I can&#x27;t imagine what this does to fine-haired girls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually I love Pantene, but this just doesn&#x27;t cut it for me. I might try the Pantene Medium Thick Intensive Restoration Treatment and see if there is any difference between results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many different conditioners to make my hair look healthier.  This has worked the best of all I&#x27;ve tried.  It smells nice and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling heavy.  I&#x27;m very impressed with Pantene products and this doesn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great as a leave in conditioner. After using Pantene conditioner, towel dry hair, use a small amount of the mask and work thru ends prior to blow drying. It will make hair soft, smooth and shiny.</li>
    <li> I can get any product at wholesale and have tried the most expensive conditioners. The worst of them was Fredric Fekkai conditioner that claims to be a moisturizing mask - this did NOTHING. I still go back to Pantene conditioners and feel that this one is the most moisturizing. For a really deep conditioning, I wet my hair then apply it, then put my hair in a ponytail and sleep overnight (towel on pillow). Awesome. I only wish it came in a pump style bottle, the jar is very awkward and easy to spill in the shower. I transfer it to a pump bottle and it&#x27;s a pain.</li>
    <li> Love  this stuff.  Wish I could get more.</li>
    <li> I really like it and am trying to give it time to do what I need it to do which is prevent damage and prevent future damage.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. Nothing else makes my hair cooperate like this stuff. It turns my frizzy fro into cute little ringlet curls, plus it leaves my hair moisturized (though I also put on a bit of coconut oil to keep it locked in) and the scent isn&#x27;t too heavy like a lot of other products of this type. As far as I know it works for all kinds of hair types, and I would recommend this to ANYONE.</li>
    <li> I use this product daily and I love it.  I have very fine, dry hair and I find I can use it daily (not weekly) and love it.  I use one container per week, so the 3 pack works out great for me.</li>
