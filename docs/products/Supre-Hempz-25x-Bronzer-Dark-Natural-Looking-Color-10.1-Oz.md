      <li>products are amazing for your skin.  </li>
      <li>i ordered this stuff on a whim thinking it would be amazing</li>
      <li>It has a very strong mango scent.</li>
      <li>So first off, I bought a 2 pack of these from ebay at a great deal and the bottles were new/fresh.  </li>
      <li>This product makes your skin feel very smooth</li>
      <li>i am very fair skinned and have sensitive skin as well.</li>
      <li>Be sure the wipe your hands and nails as this is a bronzer</li>
      <li>I  love Hemp lotions they never disappoint.</li>
      <li>idk...maybe it could be the fact they put more bronzer in it?</li>
      <li>This bronzer is fantastic!</li>
      <li>I wish it had more bronzer.</li>
      <li>Love, Love, Love it.</li>
      <li>This does smell pretty good.</li>
      <li>hempz is a great, natural line of product!</li>
      <li>Leaves skin feeling soft, huge savings compared to buying at a salon &amp; gives a nice bronze even for fair skin</li>
      <li>;, then the once reality hit and I was home in better light that I was thinking &amp;</li>
      <li>I usually do not like sweet smelling lotions, but this one was actually very nice.</li>
      <li>However, the smell is a huge turn-off for me.  </li>
      <li>i am a huge fan of the hempz line.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only used this in level two and  three beds, but it smells amazing, no burnt smell after tanning, nice bottle too</li>
      <li>If you are fair skinned and have no base tan or hint of color in your skin I would steer clear.  </li>
      <li>My product came fast and nicely package.  </li>
      <li>It smells amazing, like a tropical drink and it really does what it says</li>
      <li>Clean smelling and moisturizing.</li>
      <li>It has a fruity scent that is actually quite pleasant even for a guy.</li>
      <li>It gives me a nice dark tan that looks great and natural!!</li>
      <li>I am fair skinned, blonde hair, blue/green eyes</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s about the same quality wise as the &amp;#34;Green Label 20x&amp;#34;, from what I&#x27;ve seen but slightly faster to tan, which is great.  </li>
      <li>They tried to sell the exact same one to me at the tanning salon for like $60, this is definitely the best deal!</li>
      <li>First off shipping is super quick .</li>
      <li>Maybe once I develop more natural color I would consider revisiting it if I need to deepen color I already have.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff it makes your skin so soft and just the right shade of tan</li>
      <li>It is a very thick lotion so it is nice, but just through use I&#x27;ve had better lotions that would be more highly recommendable.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it helps you tan any better but does leave your skin feeling very smooth and silky</li>
      <li>at first I was thinking &amp;#34;cool</li>
      <li>The product is exactly the same as I purchased in store for a lot more money.&lt;br /&gt;Hempz</li>
      <li>People who smell me after I go tanning either love it or hate it, so it may be great for some people... but not for others!</li>
      <li>After using this lotion and tanning everyday, I found that its not really the best lotion I have used.</li>
      <li>The color is true, not orange or yellow, just a true, natural-looking tan.</li>
      <li>Thank you so much.</li>
      <li>It smells like candy and goes on very well.</li>
      <li>and i became very blotchy around my neck.</li>
      <li>I love this because I see results in less than 3 times after tanning</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone who tans often and wants a natural, tropical looking tan.</li>
      <li>Overall this product works very well!  </li>
      <li>I used for one session in a stand up and came out darker for sure, but if you miss any areas even little ones there will be a big difference in coloration...</li>
      <li>Color developed after a couple of tanning sessions.  </li>
      <li>Make my skin soft</li>
      <li>My skin feels better and it does not leave markings behind.</li>
      <li>The smell is just like the purple bottle, a fresh peach scent that stays with you after the tanning session, although post-tan I think it&#x27;s a little less intense.  </li>
      <li>The first time I used this product it left dark colored marks on my legs...</li>
      <li>The smell is really nice too idk why a lot of people complained about it in past reviews.</li>
      <li>I have average skin, not pale but not naturally dark .</li>

<li> I have average skin, not pale but not naturally dark .</li>
<li> A little really does go a long way.</li>
<li> The only bad thing I have to say is that I wish the bottle were in a pump style because when applying the lotion it sometimes gets hard to squeeze it out due to lotion being on your hands. :D</li>
<li> and it takes me a long time to put it on and get it rubbed into my skin before I can get in the tanning bed</li>
<li> and I do not have dry skin by the end of the day.</li>
<li> The tan is very deep and dark, not orange!</li>
<li> Does not give the color I expected.</li>
<li> i did receive this package in due time and it was sealed too.</li>
<li> if you&#x27;re already dark, it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.</li>
<li> i&#x27;ve had no problems with their green bottle.</li>
<li> i believe the green one has 20x bronzer in it.</li>
<li> This is so natural that it does affect me badly at all.</li>
<li> in all, I would not purchase this lotion again, at least no time soon.  </li>
<li> lotion itself is a tan/light brownish color and it is quite thick, but creamy, sort of like a softer body butter.  </li>
<li> Also, it is so thick</li>
<li> I actually kept the bottle stored upside down so that I could get it out easier at the salon, but you are still having to squeeze a hard bottle with slippery lotion hands... annoying.  </li>
<li> The bottle itself is designed like the other Hempz Naturals tanning lotions, a simplistic press button and pop up lid.  </li>
<li> so I am disappointed that it is such a yucky lotion.</li>
<li> This lotion is very thick, clumpy and sticky.</li>
<li> It is very thick, so you have to use a lot.</li>
<li> well hempz, why fix what isn&#x27;t broken?</li>
<li> So disappointed, but I&#x27;ve been spoiled by other brands.</li>
<li> I decided I&#x27;d try to jump start my base tan by trying this out...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The product is exactly the same as I purchased in store for a lot more money.&lt;br /&gt;Hempz products are amazing for your skin.  I have extremeley sensitive skin and am unable to use almost every tanning product available.  I have never had a problem using this product.</li>
    <li> i am a huge fan of the hempz line. i am very fair skinned and have sensitive skin as well. i ordered this stuff on a whim thinking it would be amazing and i was kinda nervous since it had no reviews. i see it still doesn&#x27;t...i used this stuff twice and i became very blotchy around my neck. i&#x27;ve had no problems with their green bottle. i believe the green one has 20x bronzer in it. this stuff also made me orange...didn&#x27;t keep me moisturized at all either. idk...maybe it could be the fact they put more bronzer in it? if you&#x27;re already dark, it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem. i just wasn&#x27;t impressed by it. i did receive this package in due time and it was sealed too. so the company is good. as for the product? well hempz, why fix what isn&#x27;t broken? hempz is a great, natural line of product!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite tanning lotion! It smells really good when you put it on. It is very thick, so you have to use a lot. This is a good thing because it keeps the skin extra hydrated it seems. The tan is very deep and dark, not orange! The after-smell doesn&#x27;t smell unless you put your arm to your nose. There is no odor coming off of you or anything like others I have tried, and even when you do smell your arm, it smells like a box of raisins.</li>
    <li> My product came fast and nicely package.  I  love Hemp lotions they never disappoint.</li>
    <li> This is the best. Make my skin soft and I do not have dry skin by the end of the day. Love, Love, Love it.Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it!!!  Color developed after a couple of tanning sessions.  I would definitely recommend this product if you are looking for rapid results.</li>
    <li> Over all great product great color and doesn&#x27;t stink like most and doesn&#x27;t streak! Would buy more for the money!</li>
    <li> After using this lotion and tanning everyday, I found that its not really the best lotion I have used. It is a very thick lotion so it is nice, but just through use I&#x27;ve had better lotions that would be more highly recommendable. This does smell pretty good. It has a fruity scent that is actually quite pleasant even for a guy. I usually do not like sweet smelling lotions, but this one was actually very nice. I would use this lotion because its relatively inexpensive, but I would not call this a go to lotion.</li>
    <li> Does not give the color I expected. Also, it is so thick and it takes me a long time to put it on and get it rubbed into my skin before I can get in the tanning bed</li>
    <li> This has been a wonderful product, I would recommend this to everyone.  My skin feels better and it does not leave markings behind.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It smells amazing, like a tropical drink and it really does what it says, it gives you a beautiful looking tan.  I highly recommend this product to anyone who tans often and wants a natural, tropical looking tan.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff it makes your skin so soft and just the right shade of tan you need to jusmp start that summer tan</li>
    <li> Really solid tanning lotion! Clean smelling and moisturizing.</li>
    <li> This bronzer is fantastic! It smells like candy and goes on very well. The color is true, not orange or yellow, just a true, natural-looking tan. A little really does go a long way. The only con is that if you do not get it all off of your hands, especially the palms, it will color your palms and between your fingers.</li>
    <li> I love this because I see results in less than 3 times after tanning</li>
    <li> Overall this product works very well!  It&#x27;s about the same quality wise as the &amp;#34;Green Label 20x&amp;#34;, from what I&#x27;ve seen but slightly faster to tan, which is great.  However, the smell is a huge turn-off for me.  People who smell me after I go tanning either love it or hate it, so it may be great for some people... but not for others!</li>
    <li> They tried to sell the exact same one to me at the tanning salon for like $60, this is definitely the best deal!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this in level two and  three beds, but it smells amazing, no burnt smell after tanning, nice bottle too</li>
    <li> Love this! I was having an issue with one lotion I had purchased in germany. I end up getting a rash and I had to stop using it. This is so natural that it does affect me badly at all. The smell is really nice too idk why a lot of people complained about it in past reviews. It gives me a nice dark tan that looks great and natural!! The only bad thing I have to say is that I wish the bottle were in a pump style because when applying the lotion it sometimes gets hard to squeeze it out due to lotion being on your hands. :D</li>
    <li> This smells so good. I wish it had more bronzer.</li>
    <li> This product makes your skin feel very smooth I&#x27;m not sure if it helps you tan any better but does leave your skin feeling very smooth and silky</li>
    <li> First off shipping is super quick . ordered mine on a Tuesday was here by that Thursday . I have average skin, not pale but not naturally dark . I change between a level two and three bed every month and lay full time for both, it works great never orange and smells like peaches and have gotten compliments from people walking by my bed saying how good it smells . great moisture !!! Defiantly a buy !!!!</li>
    <li> Great product speedy shipping</li>
    <li> This lotion is very thick, clumpy and sticky. It has a very strong mango scent. It provides awesome noticeable color so I am disappointed that it is such a yucky lotion. So disappointed, but I&#x27;ve been spoiled by other brands.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this product it left dark colored marks on my legs... never used it again</li>
    <li> Doesnt work! Go with tingle!</li>
    <li> So first off, I bought a 2 pack of these from ebay at a great deal and the bottles were new/fresh.  I am fair skinned, blonde hair, blue/green eyes etc. and have been using the Hempz Naturals Tan Maximizer (purple bottle) which is wonderful, no burns, no bronzer.  I decided I&#x27;d try to jump start my base tan by trying this out... oh no.  If you are fair skinned and have no base tan or hint of color in your skin I would steer clear.  I used for one session in a stand up and came out darker for sure, but if you miss any areas even little ones there will be a big difference in coloration... at first I was thinking &amp;#34;cool I&#x27;m darker&amp;#34;, then the once reality hit and I was home in better light that I was thinking &amp;#34;oh god what have I done&amp;#34;.  I noticed streaks/blotchy patches and overall and orange-y hue, not at all what I had in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion itself is a tan/light brownish color and it is quite thick, but creamy, sort of like a softer body butter.  I actually kept the bottle stored upside down so that I could get it out easier at the salon, but you are still having to squeeze a hard bottle with slippery lotion hands... annoying.  The bottle itself is designed like the other Hempz Naturals tanning lotions, a simplistic press button and pop up lid.  Note that these are manufactured without an inner seal.  The smell is just like the purple bottle, a fresh peach scent that stays with you after the tanning session, although post-tan I think it&#x27;s a little less intense.  Be sure the wipe your hands and nails as this is a bronzer and it will discolor.  I did feel like this left my skin heavier/richer/greasier post-tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would not purchase this lotion again, at least no time soon.  Maybe once I develop more natural color I would consider revisiting it if I need to deepen color I already have. Therefore, I&#x27;m sure it would be great for say someone who already has color established or anyone a step or two up from fair skin. I&#x27;ll definitely be sticking to the Hempz purple bottle.itely be sticking to the Hempz purple bottle.</li>
    <li> Leaves skin feeling soft, huge savings compared to buying at a salon &amp; gives a nice bronze even for fair skin</li>
