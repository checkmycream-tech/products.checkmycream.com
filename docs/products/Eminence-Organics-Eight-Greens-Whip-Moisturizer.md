      <li>I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, but I do love eminence products.</li>

      <li>Love Eminence Organic.  </li>
      <li>LOVE IT</li>
      <li>The best facial cream/moisturizer, I use it for days and nights as well.</li>
      <li>Still very happy that my sensitive skin had found a Brand that wouldn&#x27;t break out my skin, give me blisters or scars, I happily selected this moisturizer for my 41 year old face.    </li>
      <li>I love and will order as soon as I run out.</li>
      <li>Super soft and delicious</li>
      <li>I feel completely hydrated from it which is great in the wicked Midwestern winter.</li>
      <li>And no painful breakouts!</li>
      <li>At first I thought this is not moisturizing enough, but then I found that it&#x27;s just perfect for summer time.  </li>
      <li>Huge difference.</li>
      <li>It was recommend to me after a facial and has worked great to minimize breakouts.</li>
      <li>Great price considering the amount spas charge for the same product!</li>
      <li>If I do a light moisturizer I don&#x27;t break out but look haggard and peely.</li>
      <li>I have no breakouts while using this, and just love the fresh smell.</li>
      <li>This is a fabulous moisturizer for all skin ages and types.  </li>
      <li>This one smells like lavender with a tad of mildew mixed in and doesn&#x27;t feel as great as stone crop on.</li>
      <li>This moisturizer is fantastic.</li>
      <li>We enjoyed it very much.  </li>
      <li>Feel in love after first use.  </li>
      <li>It has a rich, creme texture</li>
      <li>It is so rich and creamy but not greasy at all</li>
      <li>Either way, when I slathered this on full strength, it still did not cause any outbreaks, redness, or irritation, which for me is rare!</li>
      <li>but it actually leaves your skin fairly matte after you put it</li>
      <li>I am 58 and have begun to get sweet comments about my skin since I began my routine of facials every 3 months and this skincare</li>
      <li>I love Amazon because I know the reviews are real, not some company making them up.</li>
      <li>Seller shipped product quickly and it came with a safety seal under the cap and boxed.</li>
      <li>Liked some of their other products better.</li>
      <li>Love this product, so glad i was able to get it thru Amazon for less!</li>
      <li>Amazon makes returns easy, but returning it twice is a bit much, so I kept it and am using it.  </li>
      <li>First, do not be intimidated by the thickness of this cream!  </li>
      <li>HIGHLY recommend it!!!</li>
      <li>but since applying the product before and after tanning my skin looks youthful and golden.</li>
      <li>Totally worth the money.</li>
      <li>Its rich and gentle.</li>
      <li>I am only giving it 3 stars because it is a very heavy moisturizer ( which can be good) and in the very warm weather, I have to use something much lighter.  </li>
      <li>Great under makeup without making weird swirls as most moisturizers do.</li>
      <li>Apply to a cleansed face and always be sure to have freshly washed hands prior to applying product to your face, so that you don&#x27;t introduce any unwanted bacteria.  </li>
      <li>thank you very much for the product.  </li>
      <li>This is a great product to keep your skin looking and feeling young and soft but it is also very helpful in eleminating adult break outs.</li>
      <li>I used the stone crop moisturizer in the past and it smelled amazing and felt fabulous on my skin.</li>
      <li>Proper usage will assure that you get the \\&quot;most bang for your buck\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>Love the entire line of Eminence.  </li>
      <li>Love this brand of products and would definitely recommend.</li>
      <li>First a foremost</li>
      <li>I have spent hundreds of dollars on products like Lancome and none have ever really changed my skin for the better so quickly</li>
      <li>If I do a deep hydration for the fine lines and peeling (from trying to rid cavernous pores of blackheads)</li>
      <li>I have melasma from pregnancy and over-sunned skin from the 80&#x27;s, and this really does help to keep that at bay.</li>
      <li>It is very moisturizing but it has a funky smell</li>
      <li>This really does wonders for my skin.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The product came unsealed so I returned it, but it came unsealed again. Amazon makes returns easy, but returning it twice is a bit much, so I kept it and am using it.  I like the product but it is very thick. It said that it could be thinned with water. By putting a little water on my fingers and blending it on my fingers it worked well. This also will make it last longer.</li>
    <li> The cream itself isn&#x27;t that bad; it just made me break out. Had to stop using it. I have combination, fair skin.</li>
    <li> This moisturizing cream feels very nourishing on your skin but the scent is a little strange.  Not sure I would spend this much again on a cream that I&#x27;m not crazy about.</li>
    <li> I love this brand of skin care.  Goes on smoothly and feels nice on the skin. This time the cream is very thick and has an odd smell.  I think it is old and I&#x27;ll have to throw it out.</li>
    <li> Love it! A great product line!</li>
    <li> thank you very much for the product.  We enjoyed it very much.  We will be coming back for more later.</li>
    <li> I buy this all the time. It&#x27;s my favorite.  I am sure I&#x27;ve written reviews before for it.  Eminence is one of my favorite brands, and this moisturizer is my favorite from them.  They have their own farms in Hungary, and it&#x27;s all organic, with none of the horrible preservatives that most commercially made stuff has.  This really does wonders for my skin.  I have melasma from pregnancy and over-sunned skin from the 80&#x27;s, and this really does help to keep that at bay. I have no breakouts while using this, and just love the fresh smell. This usually lasts me for about 4 months.</li>
    <li> Imminence is the best of the best. I have never used any product by them that I have not seen results immediately. That it&#x27;s organic is icing on the cake.</li>
    <li> Love Eminence Organic.  My favorite moisturizes are Eight Greens Whip and stone crop - best hydrating moisturizers from the whole line I think!</li>
    <li> First a foremost I love Amazon because I know the reviews are real, not some company making them up.The reviews people have made on items have helped me a lot,so I felt I wanted to give back.The Eminence Eight Greens Whip Moisturizer is the best I have ever tried PERIOD. Ive recently been tanning to get ready for a trip and it has saved my skin.In the past when I would tan my face looked older and freckles would appear but since applying the product before and after tanning my skin looks youthful and golden.I have spent hundreds of dollars on products like Lancome and none have ever really changed my skin for the better so quickly,Ive only had the product a few days.I plan on buying more of their products for my skin care needs.</li>
    <li> I generally use this in the evening and my skin just eats it up.  It smells green and looks heavy, but is not and does not make you break out.  It makes my skin look insanely healthy in the morning and I will continue to buy it for my nighttime moisturizer.  Green is the way to go!</li>
    <li> Love this product, so glad i was able to get it thru Amazon for less! leaves your skin moisturized without feeling oily.</li>
    <li> I loveeeee Eminence products!!!! Not all of them work for me but this one is a great moisturizer. It smells wonderful and goes on light and not greasy.</li>
    <li> Love this line. My skin got brighter once I started using the cream.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Just as explained! Very happy with the purchase!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay.  Sometimes I would breakout randomly while using the product, but it could have been stress or environmental - hard to tell.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, but I do love eminence products.</li>
    <li> Super soft and delicious</li>
    <li> Really softens the skin and helps with my crows feet and any dry skin on face. Love this brand of products and would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Great price considering the amount spas charge for the same product! The addition of a few drops of water can make this moisturizer lighter for day wear, yet provide a sealed &amp; smooth appearance.  The moisturizer is not greasy or oily, and the appearance is similar to a liquid foundation.</li>
    <li> This is so moisturizing and my face is so supple. I love and will order as soon as I run out.</li>
    <li> Love the entire line of Eminence.  HIGHLY recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> I love this face cream!! I will never be without this product again. It is so rich and creamy but not greasy at all</li>
    <li> my face is clean as a white paper</li>
    <li> Feels like dry chalk on the face when it soaks in</li>
    <li> Eminence is saving my 49 year old carpenter and welder skin. Its rich and gentle. I feel completely hydrated from it which is great in the wicked Midwestern winter.</li>
    <li> Really sticky feeling after applying. Gave it to my daughter to see if she could use it and she had the same response.</li>
    <li> The only thing I do not like this product is the smell that is a bit too strong.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it is a good product as well.</li>
    <li> Was okay. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. Liked some of their other products better.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this product! When I got pregnant, my skin was a mess. When I began using this, my skin cleared up almost immediately and has stayed that way since!</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer! Not greasy, but hydrates.  Make up goes on beautifully over it.  Doesn&#x27;t break me out.  It&#x27;s great for hormonal skin.  I give it a ten!!!</li>
    <li> This moisturizer acts like a balancing cream for normal to oily combination skin.  I have to supplement with Na-Pca or oils when humidity is low.  I don&#x27;t see much change in my complexion, I still break out thanks to hormones.  I like Eminence, so I&#x27;m going to try another product.</li>
    <li> After Clinque discontinued all my old favorites, I had to search to replace them (and leave Clinique behind).  I first tried the Eminence eye cream, then one of their facial scrubs. Still very happy that my sensitive skin had found a Brand that wouldn&#x27;t break out my skin, give me blisters or scars, I happily selected this moisturizer for my 41 year old face.    First, do not be intimidated by the thickness of this cream!  We are talking thick, HOWEVER, it seems that all of Eminence&#x27;s products are structured so that you can customize them. To do so, you will simply need to mix the cream with a drop of water to obtain the consistency that your skin prefers.  Lighter for the day, or heavier at night. Either way, when I slathered this on full strength, it still did not cause any outbreaks, redness, or irritation, which for me is rare! Even when applied thick, a little goes a long way.    I&#x27;ve only been using this cream for a week now, and my whole face is brighter, happier, smoother.  Skin completes a turnover cycle within a couple weeks time, so I expect when that has occurred, my skin will be even healthier.   The 8 greens that are included in this moisturizer are food for your skin!  My skin seems better prepared to fight and be protected against the elements here.    On a side note, I live in Hawaii where my skin has to deal with salt and sun, so dry skin is an issue.  When I removed the seal from the new container, I rubbed the extra on my elbows..smooth as silk...days later!</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous moisturizer for all skin ages and types.  Proper usage will assure that you get the \\&quot;most bang for your buck\\&quot;.  Unlike most moisturizers, it doesn&#x27;t contain water.  A dime size or less portion is sufficient for most applications.  Apply to a cleansed face and always be sure to have freshly washed hands prior to applying product to your face, so that you don&#x27;t introduce any unwanted bacteria.  With clean wet finger tips, emulsify the product with a small of water and apply to your face and neck. This product is excellent for balancing hormonal acne breakouts. For added benefits, once you have emulsified the product, you can add a few drops of \\&quot;Eight Greens\\&quot; Serum to the emulsified product , prior to application.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  This is a great product to keep your skin looking and feeling young and soft but it is also very helpful in eleminating adult break outs.</li>
    <li> I used the stone crop moisturizer in the past and it smelled amazing and felt fabulous on my skin. I highly recommend that product over this one. This one smells like lavender with a tad of mildew mixed in and doesn&#x27;t feel as great as stone crop on. Overall it works though...if you can deal with the scent!</li>
    <li> Anything by this brand is wonderful. I love it so much I wish I could use it everyday. Smells great as well! Again, a little goes a very long way.</li>
    <li> absolutely the best organic cream to put on your face. I am 58 and have begun to get sweet comments about my skin since I began my routine of facials every 3 months and this skincare</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it for a long time now, so i didn&#x27;t see any significant change so far. It has a rich, creme texture but it actually leaves your skin fairly matte after you put it on(I didnt add water, as i have dry skin). If you are putting on a silicone based primer on for makeup after using this it will be welly set. It seemed did a little work on fading my acne marks, but i am not entirely sure that it was because of this product.</li>
    <li> The product did not feel or act the same as the one I ordered from Eminence directly</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> I have a wonderful mix of aging and hormonal skin. If I do a deep hydration for the fine lines and peeling (from trying to rid cavernous pores of blackheads) I break out in cystic acne. If I do a light moisturizer I don&#x27;t break out but look haggard and peely. Awesome. This moisturizer is fantastic. Deeply hydrates, smells wonderful, not greasy but gives a pleasant glow. And no painful breakouts! This is a forever purchase for me. Excited to try other Eminence products after such a positive experience. Totally worth the money. Seller shipped product quickly and it came with a safety seal under the cap and boxed. New item in excellent condition. No leakage.</li>
    <li> It feels different to me and less hydrating almost sticky even with water added.&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t buy it again...like my Argan Oil so much better now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to update about this. I have returned to using the Eminence products. When I mentioned to a certified seller my experience with buying online she said you can&#x27;t be confidant on the date on the package. Could be old. I am sure that is what was wrong with it as the products I bought from her were far superior to these. I would not recommend buying them online but go to a certified seller. Huge difference. Sorry I threw away the money here on their products. Should have asked for a refund.</li>
    <li> It is very moisturizing but it has a funky smell</li>
    <li> Makes my skin so soft.  Feel in love after first use.  Great under makeup without making weird swirls as most moisturizers do.</li>
    <li> As usual love all the Eminence products I have tried.  This moisturizer is a bit heavier but can be lightened by adding a drop of water or another of the wonderful Eminence products.  Love that it is not at all greasy but helps keep this aging skin firm(er). And best of all, it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
    <li> The best facial cream/moisturizer, I use it for days and nights as well. Suitable for any skin type, not greasy</li>
    <li> I like this more than the Stone Crop Whipped Moisturizer - which I find leaves my face more matt than moisturized. I like this one better.</li>
    <li> Eminence is second-to-none as a skincare company, and this moisturizer is terrific. It&#x27;s contains lots of plant estrogens, so it&#x27;s perfect for someone who has trouble with minor blemishes but whose skin is dry. Non-oily...not a &amp;#34;barrier&amp;#34; protection cream, but a very nice, mid-weight moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a former salon owner and esthetician, I wouldn&#x27;t use anything but Eminence.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this to anyone who has problem skin,, its not greasy,, keeps my face moisturized and even toned. LOVE IT</li>
    <li> Has made a difference in my complexion.  Feels wonderful!!!!</li>
    <li> At first I thought this is not moisturizing enough, but then I found that it&#x27;s just perfect for summer time.  Absorbs very well by my skin and won&#x27;t leave any sticky feeling.</li>
    <li> good looks, good smell and good for me. a triple win.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Eminence cleansers before, but not this product. I have to say, it&#x27;s different--thick, somewhat smelly (think cactus plant), and makes the skin immediately dusty-looking. But the smell settles in a few minutes, and my skin is smoother, clearer, and definitely younger looking. And it is the rarest of moisturizers that doesn&#x27;t make my skin look slick after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so sold on this that I thought I&#x27;d expand and try the Calendula, Sour Cherry, and the Bright Skin Moisturizers, too, but one had a weird smell, and none came close to working as well as this moisturizer. In fact, I broke out with Sour Cherry, felt that Bright Skin was just a thick SPF, and I could NOT stand the sweet floral smell of Calendula that would NOT go away. Eight Greens is the winner, hands down.</li>
    <li> Sounds like the perfect moisturizer - if you can stand the smell. It smells HORRIBLE and it doesn&#x27;t dissipate at all! If you want to keep vampires (and everyone else) away, this is your product.</li>
    <li> Love it. It was recommend to me after a facial and has worked great to minimize breakouts. A little expensive, but worth it.</li>
    <li> I am only giving it 3 stars because it is a very heavy moisturizer ( which can be good) and in the very warm weather, I have to use something much lighter.  You only need a tiny bit.  With that said, this item will last for at least 3 months,</li>
