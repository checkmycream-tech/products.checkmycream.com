<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My 17 y/o daughter and I use these and love them!!  My daughter especially uses them when she performs on stage.  She told me that &amp;#34;...they are really good, sturdy lashes!&amp;#34;  Seller was also a pleasure to do business with!  Definitely recommend!!!</li>
    <li> I have ordered this brand of lashed before and I was satisfied so I ordered this style. They are dramatic night-time lashes. They have a thick plastic base so you cannot get away with them for daytime wear.</li>
    <li> These lashes are GREAT! I love them, and for the price they&#x27;re not bad! They give off a dramatic statement but it can pass as natural lashes as well. My only problem is the strip where you apply the glue is really thick, and if you don&#x27;t cut the excess off they become uncomfortable to wear.</li>
    <li> Very good. Thanks a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards,</li>
    <li> They look fake they feel fake, not at all for everyday wear, more like to wear with a Halloween costume. Save your money I will stick with my Revlon lashes</li>
    <li> I got a lot of compliments on them! Kind of ridiculously long. . But fun and flirty! If I wanted to buy one pair in the store; It would be $7 or more! So I think its a good deal.</li>
    <li> Got them today. Came way earlier than the expected delivery time and I LOVE THEM... Great product for the price. I WILL DEFINITELY ORDER AGAIN!!</li>
    <li> LOVE THESE! If you want a bold statement for your eyes, these are the lashes!</li>
    <li> I wear them every single day there very amazing I get them every time I get to my last 5  it takes a while for them to get delivered but worth it  ~only if you want long  lashes</li>
    <li> These are M. A. C. eyelashes &amp;amp; they are spectacular!  You truly must be a diva to wear these as they&#x27;re very dramatic.  Try purchasing these from M. A C.,  and see how much you&#x27;ll pay.  I also purchased the &amp;quot;Duo&amp;quot; brush on glue to secure the lashes better.  LOVE!</li>
    <li> Cheap. uncomfortable. Messy. I hate these lashes. I thew them away after the first use. I guess you get what you pay for. Do not buy these.</li>
    <li> Too thick and too heavy</li>
    <li> glue didn&#x27;t work, looked terrible.  As usual, expected it, but hoped for the best.  Costs more than $4 to ship something from Japan so you know you&#x27;re not getting great stuff.</li>
    <li> Love these eyelashes and how they come individually I use them on my clients and they love them deffinetly going to buy more</li>
    <li> Love it will definitely buy more!!!!💜</li>
    <li> The lashes are just great~&lt;br /&gt;Very good quality~ ^-^&lt;br /&gt;And the shape fit my eyes quite well.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend despite for the shipping time~</li>
    <li> These are a really good bargain, I&#x27;m a make-up finatic and these are good looking lashes,  not human hair quality but for synthetic materials , I believe they&#x27;re well put together.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like how they say glue comes but it doesn&#x27;t its like fake glue .. they&#x27;re cheap but i guess okay for photoshoot look not everyday lashes</li>
    <li> Weren&#x27;t the same ones I got last time. These are ok but last time I received different ones &amp; liked them better I ordered the same ones.</li>
    <li> Fast shipment and in good condition. Definitely recommend ordering these lashes. They look long but they look really nice when you put them on.</li>
    <li> For the price they are great.</li>
    <li> I had know problem with these lashes.I can use them for every day wear.They did not come with glue and the price was good.</li>
    <li> the glue sucks if u want to use them get better glue</li>
    <li> I thought I would get 10 individual packs as shown above but I got one pack with a bunch in there but didn&#x27;t look like what  I thought I ordered. Would not order again</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s plastic unfortunately but with the price I really shouldn&#x27;t expect much it&#x27;s more of a temporary fix.</li>
    <li> These eyelashes are hard to apply.  I thought these would be easier to use since that are reusable - guess not.</li>
    <li> Long tapered lashes. The band isn&#x27;t as flexible as some are. I loosen them up by gently bending and slightly twisting. I also put them on a very curved object (overnight) to enhance the lash band curvature. (they go on a little too straight, they need to curve.) They are long banded so I do trim them to fit my eyes. I have gotten a lot of compliments on my lashes. Even with ten pairs , I can get at least 5+ wear days, (if taken care  of properly), on one set of lashes. It took one exact month to get these so, if you need them sooner.......................&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I will buy these and probably other styles from this shop.</li>
    <li> these are super thick!!! more so than i expected, i guess that can be a good or bad thing i have the same glue for other lashed, i think because they are so thick and sturdy at the base, they have touble curving to the contour of my eyelid and sticking to the innermost part of my eyelid., they feel beautiful though!</li>
    <li> I love these!! They are so dramatic and beautiful I would recommend these to anyone who wants that movie star look!! the only bad part is that the glue wasn&#x27;t real but I always use a different type of glue anyway and for this price forget the glue!</li>
    <li> I bought these lashes about 4 months ago and everyone loves them! I even had to share with my friends because they thought they were so nice and wanted to have beautiful lashes too! Honestly will be purchasing again.&lt;br /&gt;These lashes are dark and if you&#x27;re trying to go for a natural look these may not be for you, but then again it depends sometimes I get people telling me they look like they&#x27;re my own lashes.</li>
    <li> crap, cheap and should have know better.  live and learn. don&#x27;t buy!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I Got Them Earlier Than Expected ...&lt;br /&gt;I Love Them To Death ... 10 for the price of two&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t beat that ! I&#x27;m definitely gonna be ordering more</li>
    <li> Hated them they were so hard</li>
    <li> Very pleased i am a cosmetology student the top photo is this specific lash strip and the lash photo are lash EXTENSIONS cant even see a difference between the two they are amazing</li>
    <li> Great lashes! They look great! Not really reusable. .but for the price very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Get black eyeliner glue - this is old news for anyone who uses lashes every day. These are great for me because they go on and come off easily.</li>
    <li> Taobaopit New 10 Pair Reusable Long Fake False Eyelashes Glue Adhesives Eye. these are impossible to wear..what a horrible waste of money</li>
    <li> I generally purchase lashes from my local beauty supply store and thought purchasing these would be less expensive and last longer.  These did not last as long as the ones I purchased locally.  Normally, my lashes that I purchased locally will last at least 7or 8 days.  These fell off the next after putting them on if not sooner!  I used the clear glue which came with them, and also the brand I use with the lashes I  normally purchase.  These lashes are good for  a one-time need but not doable if you are expecting them to last a week or more!  Hope this review helps .....Follow me on PinInterest....BrooklynGirl626</li>
    <li> So I ordered these lashes as an add on to another purchase to be qualified for free shipping. (giggles) But overall, I am satisfied with the quality and quantity of my &amp;#34;add on&amp;#34; purchase. Now, unfortunately I waited a little longer than expected to get my package but  when it came I was excited! They did not come with glue, which was fine with me because I already had some; but if you dont have any glue, you can always go to your local beauty outlet and purchase a tube for no more than three dollars. They look great on if you are going for a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; or classic look! Oh! and the box that it comes in is SO cute!</li>
    <li> Esta compra tampoco me a llegado!! Gracias!!!</li>
    <li> Very long beautiful eyelashes ;) i love them and they dont look all that fake i got a lot of complements on them. The only thing i didnt get the glue so i had to buy my own</li>
    <li> These are shipped well and packaged well&lt;br /&gt;These lashes are great for te money and look awesome&lt;br /&gt;they are synthetic so the line on top of lashes is a little thick (for those considering a more natural lash)&lt;br /&gt;but if you wear lashes often or for photoshoots these are perfect&lt;br /&gt;love love love them!</li>
    <li> I love these lashes, the band is long enough to fit to any eye and can be cut to corner lashes.</li>
    <li> eyelashes were nice but the glue it came with has nothing in the tubes. or they were all dries out.&#x3D;[</li>
    <li> i choose this rate because i love the product. i like the product because it brings out my eyes very good even without makeups. I recommend this product to those who dislike using mascara.</li>
    <li> This was the PERFECT deal !!! My daughter uses these eyelashes everyday and she loves the way they look and feel. glad I could get a couple boxes at a time. one for xmas and one for bday coming up !!!  Im a Happy Momma !!!!!</li>
    <li> I normally wear wispies because I dont like the look of super fake lashes, these are very thick lashes they look pretty because they give me that cat-eye look I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for everyday use since they are kinda heavy. But great deal for 10 pairs! Shipping did take longer than I had hoped for but I was advised of the time frame so I cant complain</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these lashes and will probably being buying again.</li>
    <li> It is okay. very voluminous.</li>
    <li> love them. if you like to reuse your lashes these are perfect because when removing the old glue the lashes dont detach from the strip. Also, its a great price for the quality &amp; quantity. Will continue to buy. This is my third purchase.</li>
    <li> If you are a diva you need these eyelashes. They are perfect because you get 10 of the eyelashes. You never run out and you get extra glue.</li>
    <li> These eyelashes are a great deal for the price! I thought they were going to be some sort of hair, but they were plastic. They came in a cute box, and included  a small tube of eyelash glue. My box was really damaged, and one of the little eyelash containers was cracked, but the outer shipping package was undamaged. Also if you&#x27;re looking for natural lashes, do not buy these. They are very dramatic, and I would not suggest for everyday use.</li>
    <li> Very good product and excellent customer service. I recommend it for anyone that like eye lashes. I like it because it wort it!!</li>
    <li> They look fake they feel fake,I do NOT recommend these at all.They do not bend easily the glue sucks&lt;br /&gt;try going to KnowDeals.10 Pairs Black Thick False Eyelashes they worked great.</li>
    <li> I really love the lashes they are a great value if you try them you will love them i will reorder them</li>
    <li> They are great and reusable!!! I washed mine and they are even better!!!! These lashes are worth even dime!!!! Just had to go on here because I always read reviews and had to make sure that people knew these are great lashes!!!</li>
    <li> GREAT THERE&#x27;S SO MANY</li>
    <li> The saying \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot; applies.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, this product is inexpensive but there are reasons for that.  First, the glue that comes along was completely dried out!  The lashes are thin and hard to shape, and they are not full as described.  Do NOT waste your money, go to your local drug store and purchase lashes.</li>
    <li> i just got mine today, I love them,I ordered them on the 5th got them on the 27th it was worth the wait. it comes with a small lash glue, not much but I have my own. definitely worth the money. for those complaining about them, looking fake and not natural looking, uhh hello they&#x27;re false lashes and they state that they&#x27;re long of course they are going to look a bit dramatic. if you&#x27;re looking for a more subtle look go for shorter lashes, they look more natural.</li>
    <li> Love my eyelashes I receive from this product site.  They always come so fast and am happy to wear them daily</li>
    <li> The fact that the glue all the lashes came with weren&#x27;t reliable was disappointing because I wanted to try them as soon as I got it... But I just sucked it up, bought the duo adhesive separately. These lashes are cute for going out, but not an everyday wear.</li>
    <li> They are exactly what I needed for my studio. Full dramatic lashes that don&#x27;t look like crispy plastic. Can&#x27;t wait to use on clients.</li>
    <li> Ok so if you like the barely there look.. you might not like these. Or if your someone that has no or little natural lashes and wants a really natural (undramatic look) you might wanna pass. Or if you have really small eyes. (THESE ARE PERFECT FOR THE NATURAL LONG, FULL LOOK, NOT OVERLY THICK) If you really know how to put lashes on then the natural shape and design of these lashes will look flawless. It&#x27;s important that you cut the lashes for the size of your eye and make sure the strip is flush with the base of your lashes and eyelid. People constantly ask if I have a get my lashes professionally done! Apply glue to the bottom of the strip (part that comes in contact with lashes) AND the part of the strip that comes in contact with the skin. doing this will make the eyelashes appear as if they are growing out your skin. Next use a pair of tweezers and press your natural lashes against the false lashes to get rid of the double row of lashes. this way when you look up, again it will look as if your falsies are growing from the skin. Use an eyeliner pen (water proof) to conceal the glue. Using upward strokes following your lashes, cover and conceal the glue under lashes. REMEMBER use the glue sparsely! Too much glue will be noticeable when you cover with eyeliner. I wear these every day and get compliments on the regular. I have large almond shaped eyes. Hope this helps :)</li>
    <li> I love my false eye lashes. They make me look glamorous. With a special glue you can even sleep with them and they&#x27;re still in place the morning after. I love to have a lot of them. I recommend the product.</li>
    <li> Kind of stiff, and a bit long but for the price not so bad and you can always trim to desired size.</li>
    <li> when I received these lashes they were not as pictured or described.  I gave them to my roommates sister.  Cute, but not long enough for me or as described.  But f0r the low cost, I just gave them away. not bad but not my style</li>
    <li> these lashes were the worst lashes i have ever seen. Theres no way u could wear these lashes and no one know they were fake. these lashes are not humas hair they look plastic. there to black, they look fake. and i wear lashes every day. I cant send them back cause i tried to cut and curl one. now im stuck with 19 eyelashes i cant use. I&#x27;ll just have to throw them awful. did&#x27;t look like on site. Sherry lucas</li>
    <li> They aren&#x27;t very reusable, I get about one good wear out of them. The glue I got was empty and had to purchase my own.</li>
    <li> I ordered these because I got tired of buying expensive $3-4 per pair eyelashes. When I got these they were beautiful and just what I was looking for. I forgot that the description said you get glue, but I really didn&#x27;t expect any. I&#x27;m happy with the eyelashes and plan to reorder. They also came 2 weeks sooner than I expected.</li>
    <li> This is my second time ordering from this person and everytime was a great experience. they eyelashes are good quality</li>
    <li> Love these eyelashes and their service was also great. They were prompt &amp; courteous product works great also the glue is dry but lashes are good.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have the product yet. Purchased on 05/13.</li>
    <li> I like  the  taobaopit  reusable  false eyelashes.</li>
    <li> very unkept while shipping,the park look so rough nd torn</li>
    <li> Love Love Love these. I&#x27;ve been wearing eyelashes for year and these are better than you can get in the store. I always, always get compliments on them when I wear them. they are easy to apply and easy to remove. They blend right in with my other eyelashes. I would highly recommend them!! i am going to be buying more!!!!!</li>
    <li> My wife was wearing a pair a day. It was getting very exspensive buying from a local store. Great Deal</li>
    <li> Well... you know you get what you pay for. These were not worth the shipping costs and are completely unusable. They are made of cheap plastic and do not feel or look remotely like eyelash hair should. They are completely inflexible and almost impossible to apply. I will never buy these again.</li>
    <li> I am addicted to eyelashes.  These are not great lashes.  The band is horribly thick, hard to work with and hard to bend to the shape of your eye lid.  The lashes came out of the band easily as well. The glue that comes with them is horrible, I don&#x27;t suggest using it.</li>
    <li> Its basically plastic</li>
    <li> Glue was dried, But didn&#x27;t bother me at all. These are AMAZING lashes for the price they are. Love love love!</li>
    <li> Bought these in bulk for myself and friends for halloween,  they are cheaply made but looked fantastic on all of us. Great for an exaggerated look! Shipping was very quick and they were packaged great. Rated 5 stars because they were exactly as I expected. Not a reusable eyelash or for casual wear.</li>
    <li> These Lashes are great for everyday use. They clean up well and go on easy. They are very natural looking once you apply your mascara and blend your natual lashes to them. I had many women fooled and once I told them they where false, they asked if I had them professionally done. The only issue I had was that sometimes the ends where a bit too pokey near my inner eye and I would have to trim them and re-apply. But other than that, they where great!</li>
    <li> I have to say I order these before I run out !! I wear them everyday !! Super great deal for the price.</li>
    <li> Thick band hard to stick on with glue would not repurchase</li>
    <li> I love lashes and these are awesome! Perfect and sexy long. Lot of bang for your buck. Came in time frame promised from China. Worth the wait.</li>
