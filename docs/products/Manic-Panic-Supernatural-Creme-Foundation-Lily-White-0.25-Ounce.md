### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Worked perfectly.</li>
      <li>After getting the Anemic Powder, I was amply impressed, and this is from a make-up</li>
      <li>Best looking and easiest to apply whiteish mackup</li>
      <li>As the package came in the product was still in tact which is great because sometimes when ordering make up products it breaks into pieces.</li>
      <li>Great backup foundation as well.</li>
      <li>No odor or smell at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great seller, Great product.</li>
      <li>Well, truthfully I wasn&#x27;t very impressed when I opened it as it looks like lip butter (not balm).&lt;br /&gt;BUT, as it turns out, it makes a really good foundation.</li>
      <li>I did get both the Spectral and the Anemic Powders to be fair, so I can change my look.</li>
      <li>What more can you ask for in a foundation?</li>
      <li>Not overdrying or too oily like many of these.</li>
      <li>Even with a top layer of powder it was inadequate.  </li>
      <li>happy with it and would recommend it to very fair-skinned women and those that want any sort of pallor.</li>
      <li>The shipping was quick and I am very pleased.</li>
      <li>This stuff is perfect and as long as you spread it evenly, you won&#x27;t even appear to be wearing makeup.</li>
      <li>I loved this product so much!</li>
      <li>Fast shipment, product quality perfect (as in- as advertized and not old and expired).&lt;br /&gt;- - - - Good stuff.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an amazing product and completely worth trying out.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other Manic Panic products that I am very happy with</li>
      <li>You&#x27;d think all that oil would make it easy to get out of the compact and apply.</li>
      <li>And it goes on smooth, covering blemishes without caking.</li>
      <li>I was really hoping for more with this product.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t worn this for a whole night yet, but I used it in combination with powder that they sell in my trial run and was pretty pleased.</li>
      <li>I was given Supernatural pressed powder as a gift, I must say if you want to achieve that perfect pale vampire look without going over board then this is a must have!</li>
      <li>, I was testing it&#x27;s capability to cover darker areas) and it really allows you to decide how light you want to go.</li>
      <li>Best white make-up product I have ever spent money on and will try to buy it again.</li>
      <li>Depending on how you use it...you can make your face just paler, or white with more layering.</li>
      <li>I very easily breakout, so I wanted to be careful not to get the stuff that just cakes on and clogs your pores.</li>
      <li>I really did the job when I needed to use it.</li>
      <li>and you don&#x27;t need an extreme amount unless you really want to look completely dead lol.</li>
      <li>I rate this product as just okay, because it isn&#x27;t the smooth, mousse type of cream foundation I was looking for, but instead a thin, blotchy coverage type of product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s weird, cause the powder is great.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, I have a warm porcelain skin-tone (which is unfortunate to have) that makes ANY store brand&#x27;s fairest shade of foundation make my face look MUCH darker than my decollatage, which is pasty white, so this foundation should be perfect.</li>
      <li>Word to the wise, don&#x27;t use the sponge that comes with it, or you&#x27;ll tear the sponge up trying to make it work, and dampening the sponge doesn&#x27;t do a thing except make the product even more thin and hard to use.</li>
      <li>The first night, I used up more than half the product trying to get my face white enough to satisfy the director.  </li>
      <li>I had to scramble to Alcone (a bricks-and-mortar theater supply store) the next day to get an adequate white foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>, it offers no coverage at all</li>
      <li>Waste of money, Manic Panic&#x27;s white pump foundation&#x27;s way better.</li>
      <li>I enjoy the product, but on my skin, it was greasy and Im already pale</li>
      <li>I do recommend the Spectral Powder if using this, as it seems to be more of a thin but sturdy foundation but probably covers few imperfections, and I can say that the MP powders smooth everything out and are great.&lt;br</li>
      <li>SUPER hard to get on (very hard, can&#x27;t apply it easily) and yet it wears very oily and greasy!</li>

<li> Now the white make-up is hard to get on the applicator pad at first.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s near impossible to apply, and the formulation seems to include some ingredient that irritates my skin and causes me to break out, on top of that</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t look cakey like other white makeup.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s quite solid, so you really have to dig in to get any, otherwise it&#x27;s just this thin film that leaves blotchy patches.</li>
<li> I even tried adding water and mixing it with other types of foundation.</li>
<li> Actually, I wouldn&#x27;t use this product alone, it&#x27;s so hard to spread -</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not really white on your face, it&#x27;s hard to blend.  </li>
<li> Not worth bothering with.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s really hard for me to find makeup pale enough for my skin tone.</li>
<li> I slap it on in sections and then top it with another liquid base to mix the pale color I want.</li>
<li> I like the mirror inside, and the little storage door for the sponge works</li>
<li> this product if you want to make your face a LITTLE BIT paler than it is, for a party or a night in the clubs or whatever,  For theater or performance purposes which require whiteface</li>
<li> , it&#x27;s so heavy</li>
<li> packaging is appealingly heavy too, which makes this feel like quality as you hold it during operation.</li>
<li> Highlight and Contour everyday...</li>
<li> I will continue to buy the pale powder.  </li>
<li> Very clumpy and pasty - impossible to spread or blend.</li>
<li> (seriously, none)</li>
<li> it&#x27;s useless.  </li>
<li> this is some of the worst foundation I have ever used, and I&#x27;ve used a lot of foundations</li>

    <li> this is some of the worst foundation I have ever used, and I&#x27;ve used a lot of foundations, it&#x27;s so heavy it&#x27;s near impossible to apply, and the formulation seems to include some ingredient that irritates my skin and causes me to break out, on top of that, it offers no coverage at all (seriously, none) Not worth bothering with.  It&#x27;s weird, cause the powder is great.</li>
    <li> Used for costume. Worked perfectly. Depending on how you use it...you can make your face just paler, or white with more layering. Not overdrying or too oily like many of these.</li>
    <li> contouring and highlighting? UM THIS IS AHHHMAZING lasted me 11 months. Highlight and Contour everyday... Repurchase list for my kit.. Great backup foundation as well. No odor or smell at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great seller, Great product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really hard for me to find makeup pale enough for my skin tone. This stuff is perfect and as long as you spread it evenly, you won&#x27;t even appear to be wearing makeup.</li>
    <li> Very clumpy and pasty - impossible to spread or blend. I even tried adding water and mixing it with other types of foundation. Although I&#x27;ve liked other Manic Panic products, this one turned out to be rather useless.</li>
    <li> Smells like a rotten yogurt .Simply, you ca never wear it!</li>
    <li> I loved this product so much! I really did the job when I needed to use it. It&#x27;s an amazing product and completely worth trying out. Now the white make-up is hard to get on the applicator pad at first. This creme has lasted me a while and you don&#x27;t need an extreme amount unless you really want to look completely dead lol. Best white make-up product I have ever spent money on and will try to buy it again.</li>
    <li> I enjoy the product, but on my skin, it was greasy and Im already pale but it didnt give me the vampire look I wanted, But i think it would go well with a white powder.</li>
    <li> Not enough coverage for my liking</li>
    <li> Consistence was off. It goes on like a tacky glue</li>
    <li> As the package came in the product was still in tact which is great because sometimes when ordering make up products it breaks into pieces.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not really white on your face, it&#x27;s hard to blend.  I&#x27;ve tried other Manic Panic products that I am very happy with but I do not recommend the cream.  I will continue to buy the pale powder.  I do like that it&#x27;s vegan.</li>
    <li> Best looking and easiest to apply whiteish mackup i&#x27;ve ever used !!!</li>
    <li> I bought this &amp;#34;foundation&amp;#34; in order to perform in an opera requiring whiteface.  The first night, I used up more than half the product trying to get my face white enough to satisfy the director.  Even with a top layer of powder it was inadequate.  I had to scramble to Alcone (a bricks-and-mortar theater supply store) the next day to get an adequate white foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use this product if you want to make your face a LITTLE BIT paler than it is, for a party or a night in the clubs or whatever,  For theater or performance purposes which require whiteface it&#x27;s useless.  This product should not be marketed as &amp;#34;foundation&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I was really hoping for more with this product. It&#x27;s quite solid, so you really have to dig in to get any, otherwise it&#x27;s just this thin film that leaves blotchy patches. Actually, I wouldn&#x27;t use this product alone, it&#x27;s so hard to spread - I slap it on in sections and then top it with another liquid base to mix the pale color I want.

    <li> Doesn&#x27;t look cakey like other white makeup.</li>
    <li> I ordered this makeup for my Halloween costume this year. I very easily breakout, so I wanted to be careful not to get the stuff that just cakes on and clogs your pores. I haven&#x27;t worn this for a whole night yet, but I used it in combination with powder that they sell in my trial run and was pretty pleased. The shipping was quick and I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> And it goes on smooth, covering blemishes without caking. What more can you ask for in a foundation? I like the mirror inside, and the little storage door for the sponge works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is appealingly heavy too, which makes this feel like quality as you hold it during operation.</li>
    <li> Fast shipment, product quality perfect (as in- as advertized and not old and expired).&lt;br /&gt;- - - - Good stuff.</li>
    <li> Having used MP&#x27;s hair dye for 12 years, I decided about 2 years ago to start using their cosmetics. After getting the Anemic Powder, I was amply impressed, and this is from a make-up artist.&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so the review. Well, truthfully I wasn&#x27;t very impressed when I opened it as it looks like lip butter (not balm).&lt;br /&gt;BUT, as it turns out, it makes a really good foundation. I tried it on the back of my hand (yes, I know it is not the same colour as my face, I was testing it&#x27;s capability to cover darker areas) and it really allows you to decide how light you want to go. I do recommend the Spectral Powder if using this, as it seems to be more of a thin but sturdy foundation but probably covers few imperfections, and I can say that the MP powders smooth everything out and are great.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with it and would recommend it to very fair-skinned women and those that want any sort of pallor. Unfortunately, I have a warm porcelain skin-tone (which is unfortunate to have) that makes ANY store brand&#x27;s fairest shade of foundation make my face look MUCH darker than my decollatage, which is pasty white, so this foundation should be perfect. I did get both the Spectral and the Anemic Powders to be fair, so I can change my look. At $7.50, this was a steal.</li>
    <li> I was given Supernatural pressed powder as a gift, I must say if you want to achieve that perfect pale vampire look without going over board then this is a must have! I&#x27;m Fangs over heels for this product!</li>
    <li> SUPER hard to get on (very hard, can&#x27;t apply it easily) and yet it wears very oily and greasy! You&#x27;d think all that oil would make it easy to get out of the compact and apply. Waste of money, Manic Panic&#x27;s white pump foundation&#x27;s way better.</li>
