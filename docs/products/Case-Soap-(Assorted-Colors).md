      <li>Excellent for your special soaps and completely reasonable.</li>
      <li>Nice color and easy to travel with.</li>
      <li>I love that it comes in colors</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the greatest quality hinge and it will snap with enough uses, but that is months away.</li>
      <li>so I wonder when the top comes off from the bottom.</li>
      <li>I just ordered two more because I&#x27;m so pleased with it.</li>
      <li>The items did an ok job in keeping my soap in place.</li>
      <li>Satisfied with purchase but wish the top just slid on and off</li>
      <li>This is a nice soap holder for travel, but it is quite huge.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many cases I looked at before deciding on this one.  </li>
      <li>It did the job fairly okay for about a week.</li>
      <li>Customer service was great as they sent me the new one</li>
      <li>After bought it discovered that Bed Bath &amp; Beyond sells soap cases for much cheaper and are good quality.</li>
      <li>It is also easy to take your soap with you when traveling or going to the gym.</li>
      <li>It actually is better in this case because it allows the soap to dry out more quickly, so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
      <li>It has a secure and easy to use snap closure.</li>
      <li>It still closes and is fine otherwise.</li>
      <li>If you have a higher place and that water can rarely touch then this should be good.</li>
      <li>Cheap little case, but it works and it is perfect for a gym bag like what i use it for.</li>
      <li>It is a nice size, very securable, and light weight.</li>
      <li>Case is great, totally what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>I strive to provide useful reviews, so it this was helpful to you, please give my review a thumbs up :)</li>
      <li>It seals nicely, carries a normal bar of soap well, and I like that</li>
      <li>right where I want it!</li>
      <li>Good size for larger bars of soap.</li>
      <li>It works fine, and it&#x27;s exactly what it says on the tin.</li>
      <li>also the closing  latch provides a very satisfying snap when properly engaged.</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t think it is worth it.</li>
      <li>Leaving the case closed BUT NOT latched,  provides an excellent way to VENT the soap inside, speaking only for me ...</li>
      <li>It is kind of big.</li>
      <li>It still closes and works ok, but clearly the engineer who designed this didn&#x27;t understand the concept of stress concentrations.</li>
      <li>One of the threads that holds it shut cracked off very easily in the 2nd week.</li>
      <li>but it still snaps shut nicely and keeps my soap dry and portable.</li>
      <li>Product is as described, and fits many sizes of soap from different brands.</li>
      <li>This is NOT my first purchase of these cases.</li>
      <li>Honestly, nothing could be harder than protecting it from my car or my car the wax.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not too miffed about that, but seeing as it&#x27;s a plastic dish, it BETTER last forever!</li>
      <li>It should fit most soaps on the market, the larger soaps won&#x27;t allow the lid to completely close and latch.</li>
      <li>Does exactly what I wanted it to do.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>I simply &amp;#34;CLIP&amp;#34; the case to the top of the shower curtain.  </li>
      <li>Funny, I don&#x27;t use it for soap</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t come in the color I ordered and broke the first time I used it</li>
      <li>So, be aware of what you&#x27;re getting before you buy.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t want any old man all up on my personal soap, so this soap dish gets the job done and enables me to get my soap out of the shower and into the safety of my own room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soap</li>
      <li>Isn&#x27;t worth the high cost, got it when was 9 dollars.</li>
      <li>It closes well and fits large bars of soap well.  </li>
      <li>I got this a few years ago and it&#x27;s still as good as new.</li>
      <li>But it doesn&#x27;t really need that.</li>
      <li>haha.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really breath when it&#x27;s shut, but the soap doesn&#x27;t get soggy if you drain it before shutting.</li>
      <li>Another thing I didn&#x27;t really need</li>
      <li>Isn&#x27;t really a design flaw though i think, maybe i should have bought the stainless steel model /s.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend!</li>
      <li>Very sturdy, it has a foldover clasp to lock it</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s held up very well.</li>
      <li>However, during the shower, water can get in and that really affect my soap.</li>
      <li>It worked really well.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really hold together anymore.</li>
      <li>The first thing I did is drop this soap box, fully loaded with a new bar of soap, and break it.  </li>
      <li>a black permanent marker seemed to fix the issue :)</li>
      <li>This soap holder is durable and has a strong latch to keep it closed.  </li>
      <li>The price is high for what you get.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure my college student will be able to use it for a standard bar of soap, but it is disappointing that it won&#x27;t work for the original purpose.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> No option for color selection</li>
    <li> I wish they let you pick the color.</li>
    <li> great for my gym bag. Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> The items did an ok job in keeping my soap in place. However, during the shower, water can get in and that really affect my soap. Since i have to put it at a lower place, this happened. If you have a higher place and that water can rarely touch then this should be good.</li>
    <li> So, I just paid $9 for a single soap dish. I&#x27;m not too miffed about that, but seeing as it&#x27;s a plastic dish, it BETTER last forever! The way it&#x27;s shown on Amazon makes it look like you get one of each color (4 in all) and that&#x27;s just not the case. So, be aware of what you&#x27;re getting before you buy. The construction looks sturdy enough. I hope it lasts.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what I wanted it to do. Holds my soap, doesn&#x27;t leak. Was a great price.</li>
    <li> It closes well and fits large bars of soap well.  I would never pack this with water in it from a shower so not sure if it leaks or not, but if you just put a wet bar of soap in there, it works great. Doesn&#x27;t seem like the attachment points would break unless you were really rough with it.  I&#x27;d recommend it!  I strive to provide useful reviews, so it this was helpful to you, please give my review a thumbs up :)</li>
    <li> It works fine, and it&#x27;s exactly what it says on the tin. Just a simple soap case. Holds up well. I&#x27;ve had no issues with it. Being able to select color would be nice, though.</li>
    <li> Way too big for traveling purposes. Dont know what I was thinking. Wish I could return it.</li>
    <li> Funny, I don&#x27;t use it for soap I keep my surfboard wax in the case. Honestly, nothing could be harder than protecting it from my car or my car the wax. When it&#x27;s closed it is air tight. It never reopens on its own and no water gets in or out. I have been using it for months several times a week and it takes a beating. Great product, you can&#x27;t go wrong with the quality or size (surf wax is bigger than a bar of soap)</li>
    <li> I wish there were a way to drain the water from the case. Other than that, it works as expected.</li>
    <li> It came in the color pink instead of blue, which is fine with me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s made from a brittle plastic. The 1st time it dropped on a tile floor the latch broke apart. Maybe I can hold it together with a rubber band now.</li>
    <li> You can buy cheaper cases BUT NOT better cases, I find the hinge of this case to be of ultimate importance ... why you ask .. because at the gym showers there is not a shelf ... so while using the soap I simply &amp;#34;CLIP&amp;#34; the case to the top of the shower curtain.  also the closing  latch provides a very satisfying snap when properly engaged. Leaving the case closed BUT NOT latched,  provides an excellent way to VENT the soap inside, speaking only for me ... I really prefer to have a DRY bar of soap the next time I use the bar and not a moist slippery bar of soap.  This is NOT my first purchase of these cases.</li>
    <li> You never want to let your soap mingle with your other toiletries and this item seems to securely keep that soap isolated from the other shower buddies untill it&#x27;s to be used.  I had to dock it a star because the main hinge seems like it&#x27;ll eventually give after a few uses.  This item is perfect for a person who will be seeing a lot of unfamiliar showers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this case for 6 months and I go to the gym 5-6x a week -- so this soap case has been opened and closed about 100 times. The latch still works but the area around the latch broke off (about 1/2\\&quot;x1/4\\&quot; area). It still closes and works ok, but clearly the engineer who designed this didn&#x27;t understand the concept of stress concentrations.</li>
    <li> works well. no choice on color. i got pink. eh.</li>
    <li> Although it was pink, I don&#x27;t really care because it works as it&#x27;s supposed to.  Good size for larger bars of soap.</li>
    <li> One of the threads that holds it shut cracked off very easily in the 2nd week. It still closes and is fine otherwise.</li>
    <li> Great product. Got delivered on time.</li>
    <li> Item is good. Problem I ordered a blue one and I received a pink one!</li>
    <li> I am disappointed because I bought this soap case based on the dimensions listed and they are not correct. I need something to hold a bar of Fels-Naptha laundry soap which is longer than a regular bar of bath soap. Based on the dimensions listed, it would be perfect. Unfortunately, the length of the soap dish is not 6&amp;#34;, but about 4.5&amp;#34;. I&#x27;m sure my college student will be able to use it for a standard bar of soap, but it is disappointing that it won&#x27;t work for the original purpose.</li>
    <li> The first thing I did is drop this soap box, fully loaded with a new bar of soap, and break it.  The fall broke off one of the locking tabs.  But keep the faith here, it still works great with just one locking tab.  It seals nicely, carries a normal bar of soap well, and I like that it makes a soap dish while flipped open.  Also, packing wet bar soap usually contaminates my gym bag, and this soap box seals nicely, protecting my clothes and shaving kit from the soapy post shower drip.  It just could be a little more sturdy as it doesn&#x27;t survive being hurdled 5 feet onto a hard tile floor.</li>
    <li> Sturdy enough for everyday use in a dormitory for bar soap.</li>
    <li> um, well this case works well, but isn&#x27;t really designed for the weight of a human to stand on, as i&#x27;m on my second one already. Isn&#x27;t really a design flaw though i think, maybe i should have bought the stainless steel model /s.</li>
    <li> Wish it came in the color it was displayed. Otherwise it works well.</li>
    <li> I was a looking for a travel case for oversized bars of soap and this was perfect. It is a nice size, very securable, and light weight.</li>
    <li> Case is great, totally what I was looking for. When it arrived, it wasn&#x27;t blue like pictured, it&#x27;s a hot magenta.  That&#x27;s why this is getting 3 stars instead of 5.</li>
    <li> Nice color and easy to travel with.</li>
    <li> Satisfied with purchase but wish the top just slid on and off</li>
    <li> Product is as described, and fits many sizes of soap from different brands. Too bad couldn&#x27;t have chosen color though.</li>
    <li> One of the tabs from the snap broke. It still closes with the one... for now.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done and good quality for the price !! !! !!!!!! !!!!!!!! !!!! !!!! !!!! !!!! !! !!!!!!</li>
    <li> I received a green case. It&#x27;s already made one trip and it is the best travel soap box I&#x27;ve used. Very sturdy, it has a foldover clasp to lock it shut  so even if you don&#x27;t have it pinned down in your luggage it will stay closed. I know hotels have soap but I like mine, so having a decent soap box is excellent.</li>
    <li> Bought this for our son for college.  Wish we would have had the opportunity to select the color.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t say what the color is going to be. Complained about it and haven&#x27;t heard anything back.&lt;br /&gt;If the color isn&#x27;t listed on a product, they are more than likely going to send you the worst one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the case itself. It is kind of big. Like the locking hinge I guess. Still is all plastic so I wonder when the top comes off from the bottom. The hinge kind of pops too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst thing is when you are traveling and the soap case opens with a soap that is wet and it rolls around in your clothes. That is no good. Soap slime is the other concern. Has ridges on the bottom so some air can get underneath it if open or maybe when shut. Does it leak I wonder if there was some water in it? hmm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to send it back but I don&#x27;t think it is worth it. If anyone reads this and finds a web site to order these in another color please let me know.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a soap case for my facial soap and makeup brush soap and wanted one that would prevent them from sitting in the bottom of the case and also would allow me to close it tightly and safely.  I can&#x27;t tell you how many cases I looked at before deciding on this one.  I love that it comes in colors so I can identify each item.  I just ordered two more because I&#x27;m so pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I got this a few years ago and it&#x27;s still as good as new. I like that my soap doesn&#x27;t disappear/evaporate which makes your soap last longer. It is also easy to take your soap with you when traveling or going to the gym. I have dropped it many times and it hasn&#x27;t broken.</li>
    <li> It snaps shut.  Good construction.  Lost it and replaced it with another just like it.  It should be cheaper though.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell when I ordered this, the one I received is made by Radius. It has a secure and easy to use snap closure.</li>
    <li> Dropped it a few times but still hasn&#x27;t broken. Solid and sturdy.</li>
    <li> It is the best soap case I ever bought! I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> The quality of this soap case is good.  The price is high for what you get.  Please note - they&#x27;ll send you any color they like.  I received a magenta case.  Ok for me, but not really so much for a male I wouldn&#x27;t think.</li>
    <li> sturdy case soap but not enough room for a black soap i purchase that soap is just bigger that soap cases.</li>
    <li> I love that it&#x27;s recycled and the quality is great! it&#x27;s held up very well. it has one crack from when i dropped it on a tile floor but it still snaps shut nicely and keeps my soap dry and portable.</li>
    <li> This would be a great product if it didn&#x27;t easily break. Maybe I&#x27;m just an extra clumsy person but I dropped this once in the shower and one of the corners with the tab broke off. Customer service was great as they sent me the new one but then I dropped the second one and the exact same thing happened. I expected it to be a bit stronger but oh well. I glued the one side and the other still clicks in. Now I&#x27;m just very careful not to let it drop. If you&#x27;re looking for durability, you&#x27;re out of luck with this soap case.</li>
    <li> These soap containers are perfect for my special soap, and have held up well.  I have traveled back and forth to Africa twice with them, and hauled them hundreds of miles within the states.  Excellent for your special soaps and completely reasonable.</li>
    <li> I keeep ordering this becuase i keep loosing it and this is the best soap container ive seen specifically when i need to carry soap to the gym.  Its very hard and durable, easy to close and small enough</li>
    <li> Cheap little case, but it works and it is perfect for a gym bag like what i use it for. It doesn&#x27;t have the greatest quality hinge and it will snap with enough uses, but that is months away. or longer</li>
    <li> Isn&#x27;t worth the high cost, got it when was 9 dollars. After bought it discovered that Bed Bath &amp; Beyond sells soap cases for much cheaper and are good quality.</li>
    <li> Broke within 2 days of buying it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good. Doesn&#x27;t really breath when it&#x27;s shut, but the soap doesn&#x27;t get soggy if you drain it before shutting.</li>
    <li> Perfect for what I need!</li>
    <li> Sturdy case does what it needs to...holds soap for travel.  I only wish it came in the color I wanted (black).  Instead, I was shipped a pink one haha.  Being a guy in the military and being deployed overseas, It&#x27;s a bit more difficult to send back a product.  But in any case, it was only a few bucks anyways and a black permanent marker seemed to fix the issue :)</li>
    <li> Another thing I didn&#x27;t really need but I told myself I did.  It does a great job of sitting unused on my shelf.  I have high hopes that the next time I travel, I will make use of this and alleviate my buyer&#x27;s remorse!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best soap cases I&#x27;ve purchase, also I like that the case locks so that that soap doesn&#x27;t fall out. Will recommend to others.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s made out of very fragile plastic (if there&#x27;s such a thing). Be careful not to drop the case. Every time you drop, a part of case will break off. It&#x27;s that fragile. Was disappointed.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband&#x27;s after workout bag and he loves it.  It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> there is no color choice when I bought it, also there is no description about the color of this soap case.&lt;br /&gt;So disappointed. I thought it would be blue like the image shows,but I got a pink one. :(</li>
    <li> This soap holder is durable and has a strong latch to keep it closed.  It is your typical soap holder.</li>
    <li> Time of use at review - Months (ish)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROs - Can hold a bar of soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONs - Not good for holding shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RATING - 5 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RECOMMEND - Yes, it has all of your soap holding needs covered.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t come in the color I ordered and broke the first time I used it</li>
    <li> I used this to travel with my shampoo bar. It worked really well. It seals tight, is tough, and very easy to work with.</li>
    <li> This case does indeed hold soap.</li>
    <li> This is a nice soap holder for travel, but it is quite huge.  I guess maybe I use smaller soaps (the body shop soaps), and I could see larger bars like what you often see at the grocery store as taking up all the space in this when new.</li>
    <li> It did the job fairly okay for about a week. After a week it just started falling apart. Doesn&#x27;t really hold together anymore.</li>
    <li> A weird old dude lives in the house I live with, the kind of guy that is used to a communal lifestyle and has no problem just using s*** that&#x27;s lying around. I don&#x27;t want any old man all up on my personal soap, so this soap dish gets the job done and enables me to get my soap out of the shower and into the safety of my own room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soap dish is quite sturdy and does not leak. I got a pink one but who cares.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personal boundaries, man, come on. Get your own soap.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a college student and bought this so that I wouldn&#x27;t have to put my soap in the dirty, public soap holder. Instead, I put my soap in this case and put the case on the holder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does what it&#x27;s supposed to. I&#x27;ve dropped it a few times and it hasn&#x27;t cracked. It holds the soap in and isn&#x27;t dirty. I thought I&#x27;d have to rinse out the case every once in a while when I shower, to prevent buildup. But it doesn&#x27;t really need that.</li>
    <li> I travel a lot and just prefer good ol bar of soap!  Living in hotel its nice to use your soap and this keeps it right where I want it!</li>
    <li> Very good quality, and plenty of room.</li>
    <li> Arrived clear in color rather than the blue depicted</li>
    <li> Works fine; I&#x27;ve been keeping a bar of soap in a gym bag, the clasp has held up fine through a few dozen showers so far, and it keeps the soap from getting the rest of the stuff in my bag wet or soapy.</li>
    <li> Do not let this fall on the ground !&lt;br /&gt;It breaks easily.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that. It does perfectly what it is meant to do.</li>
    <li> Great in all ways but, they sent me one with the holes a little bigger than the other so when locking it only one side snaps shut</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a solid travel piece... snaps well.  It was a crap shoot with the color (stated &#x27;assorted colors&#x27;); I got a hot pink one, but I don&#x27;t think it will get forgotten anytime soon.</li>
    <li> Got this for traveling. Latch is very sure and never comes undone</li>
    <li> I bought this soap case as a present and he liked it. Great for home use or traveling. Thank You.</li>
    <li> I like the soap case. I don&#x27;t usually use bar soap, but I bought African black soap and I&#x27;ve heard it dries out when left sitting in water in shower. This case won&#x27;t close completely on the African black soap which is larger than the average soap. It actually is better in this case because it allows the soap to dry out more quickly, so I&#x27;m happy. It is a very good case. It should fit most soaps on the market, the larger soaps won&#x27;t allow the lid to completely close and latch.</li>
    <li> Seller very easy to work with if you are unhappy for any reason. I did not like the color (purchased for my husband, and they sent pink). They replaced with another color.</li>
