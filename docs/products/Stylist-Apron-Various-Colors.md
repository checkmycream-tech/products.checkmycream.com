<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was happy with this apron. It was defenetely what I expected. I mainly wanted it to keep nail dust off when I am working on clients.</li>
    <li> This apron is just what I needed for nail school.  Its nothing fancy but it is a good fabric for the salon and has useful pockets.  The straps are long to fit a variety of sizes.  Best of all it was inexpensive (even cheaper than the professional beauty supply store locally).</li>
    <li> Love the apron, it hasn&#x27;t started falling apart yet, and I wear it five days a week. The Teflon coating is good, but it doesn&#x27;t make the apron waterproof, as I found out. Love the quality for such a low price. Will def buy another when the need arises</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a waterproof apron, not much to it. Pretty light and easy to clean. My wife uses it while bathing the baby.</li>
    <li> I really like this apron. It does well when I wash the dog and it dries quickly so when I groom the dog, a Havanese, the apron saves my clothes from the fine flyaway hair. I like the pockets too. I recommend this apron to everyone.</li>
    <li> I cut my husband&#x27;s hair on a regular basis and tired of the hair clinging to my clothes.  This apron does the trick.  I would buy this apron again.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keeps hair off you and your clothes while cutting hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pockets to keep items handy and easy reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Non-cotton material that lets cut hair slide right off.  Really no need to clean up afterwards since hair doesn&#x27;t stick to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just use and put away after you are done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Though it is synthetic, it is great and gets used frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this if you are looking for an apron to do it&#x27;s job and not fall apart.</li>
    <li> Love the apron, especially the zippers on the bottom of the pockets to empty the hair;) only complaint is that it&#x27;s a bit long. But overall, I really like it!</li>
    <li> I feel so professional! Hubby says it&#x27;s sexy... hummm.... I love the pockets and that I don&#x27;t have hair stick all over me!</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife who wanted a durable waterproof apron for around the house.  She likes it so much I have bought 3 more for friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;I trim this off some as it is pretty long but it is fantastic.</li>
    <li> Disappointed, the cheap product. I used it when washing the dishes. NOT water proof enough, my clothes were still wet when wearing that.</li>
    <li> ~BACKGROUND~&lt;br /&gt;We purchased this apron for my wife to use when giving me and my son haircuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~PROS~&lt;br /&gt;- Lightweight&lt;br /&gt;- Adjustable neck and waist straps&lt;br /&gt;- Appears to be well-made&lt;br /&gt;- 2 large pockets in front for combs, scissors, etc.&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;- Resists water&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~CONS~&lt;br /&gt;None so far!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~CONCLUSION~&lt;br /&gt;What was bought for cutting hair is now also used while bathing the baby, bathing the dog and washing dishes.  It gets a lot of use and is still going strong.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s light and I don&#x27;t even notice that I&#x27;m wearing. I walked outside with it and noticed people staring before I realize that I have it on. The pockets are in the perfect places and the tie is tight so I don&#x27;t have to keep retying it.</li>
    <li> Great product for the money.  Can&#x27;t believe it took me this long to get one.  I love it.  It keeps the hair off and is good quality.  I love the front pockets too.</li>
    <li> i made purchase and then had a friend sew a cute phrase on it/ she loved it and has shown to many others</li>
    <li> This is a quality apron and done well the only reason I give it 2 stars is due to the weight and shoulder straps it places quite a bit of tension on the collar bones and makes me weary after several hours.</li>
    <li> I use this for dog grooming, so I get very wet from panicking dogs, and I get lots of hair all over me from the trimming.  But anywhere the apron covers stays dry and clean.  I love it!  The pockets are also awesome for my clipper guards, the little brush I use to clean fur, my scissors... pretty much anything.  It&#x27;s my favorite grooming purchase.</li>
    <li> My 90+ year old mother who has essential tremors likes to wear an apron like this when she eats.  It is great!  Easily washed, doesn&#x27;t fade or stain like her others, and is just perfect for her!</li>
    <li> Love these aprons. The last a long time. Great quality. My last one last 5 years. They clean up wonderful.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my niece who started beauty school this year.  I machine embroidered bright colored beauty shop products and tools along the hem of it.  Turned out really cute and she loved it!</li>
    <li> Sewn well, light weight, good pockets. I was mine everyday and it has held up well, no fraying or coming undone.</li>
    <li> The neck strap ties and tends to cut.  The sewing is not very good.  Maybe that&#x27;s just for my particular apron, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> Does the job to keep hair off my clothes when cutting hubby&#x27;s hair.  I like the tie around my neck to adjust as I wish; I always leave it tied for a quick put-on for cutting.</li>
    <li> Simple is good. Arrives soon.</li>
    <li> I use this at work everyday and have gotten color and bleach all over it at times. Its the perfect length and washes to perfection everytime.</li>
