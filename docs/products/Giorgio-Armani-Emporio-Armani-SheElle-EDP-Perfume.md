      <li>so thank you so so much</li>
      <li>Light, and powdery, and romantic.</li>
      <li>Shipped fast.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gotten more compliments with this than with all my other fragrances combined.</li>
      <li>I would not recommend for someone looking for a super fresh and active scent.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Makes a good extra cologne for everyday use.</li>
      <li>Since I&#x27;ve had no previous experience with Emporio Armani She, there&#x27;s no way to tell!</li>
      <li>I love this  and it&#x27;s hard to find</li>
      <li>Soft, feminine and has an edge to it that distinguishes it from the niche fragrances and the run-of-the-mill,</li>
      <li>I feel it was to much money for that cenario, but I did not wwant to send it back as I was waiting for a whie to find it and get it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always loved the Armani for women perfume, but I&#x27;ve seen it disappear from the shops and other than online, it is hard to get.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a fragrance I love! Light, and powdery, and romantic.</li>
    <li> Excelent product and seller!</li>
    <li> This is the nicest scent you could ever ask for.  I&#x27;ve used Armani for years and just tried this fragrance and I truly love it. I don&#x27;t care for light, fruity or flowery scents and this one is far from that. Even though it is not made up of any of these scents, don&#x27;t be fooled...as it is in a class all of its own.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I have been using it for the past 10 years.  First time online from Amazon. Great price.  Will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Soft, feminine and has an edge to it that distinguishes it from the niche fragrances and the run-of-the-mill, ho hum scents that are coming off the assembly lines en masse.  No nauseating aquatic or ultra sweet notes to this gem. It&#x27;s all girly woman in a sensational, delightful way.</li>
    <li> I love this  and it&#x27;s hard to find so thank you so so much</li>
    <li> This scent is my daughter-in-law&#x27;s favorite and I searched the internet this year for a good price (she gets a bottle every year).  Amazon had the best price with Prime free shipping.  All of the Armani scents are wonderful (according to my daughter-in-law) but she likes Emporio for Women the best!</li>
    <li> WHen my package arrived it hsd leked perfume all over the box , so I woud be very nerbvous about ordering nother one.

    <li> Good soft scent.  I love it.  As usual great deal in Amazon and free fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved the Armani for women perfume, but I&#x27;ve seen it disappear from the shops and other than online, it is hard to get. The scent is strong, but not overpowering. It has the right balance and it lasts all day! I get a lot of compliments when I wear this scent and on amazon.com it&#x27;s nicely priced. I love the packaging for this perfume and the shape of the container.</li>
    <li> Was everything I expected from Giorgio.  My favorite fragrance and I bought it in the mens fragrance for my husband and it smells wonderful on him.  My son was mad because I didn&#x27;t purchase him some of it.</li>
    <li> My favorite scent of all time. Great price!</li>
    <li> Shipped fast. It is the smaller of the two bottles, but is large enough to make a nice gift for the lady in your life.</li>
    <li> Very pleasant smell. Yesterday sprinkled on the wrist and the smell is still holding (though I already took a shower 2 times). I love the flavor.</li>
    <li> This definitely turns heads and in a good way. I started to buy this at Sephora but glad I saved several bucks by getting it here.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my wife as a gift because of all the positive reviews.  I am really glad I did, she loves it and I came out looking like a hero.  Pretty good for a guy with no knowledge of perfume.</li>
    <li> Got this on line and it arrived defective with the lid broken so it was spilled all over the package and I tried to return and it says I cannot return because it&#x27;s flammable!!!!! I am very upset this is not right : (</li>
    <li> This is my scent. Been wearing it for over a decade. Really grateful it is still around as I most likely will never switch.</li>
    <li> This is my first time trying this fragrance. The scent is very good. Musky, sweet, relaxing and sophisticated. Not too fresh or sexually provoking. Ideal for office use or more formal occasions IMHO. It would make me (as a man) want to know more about the woman wearing this! I would not recommend for someone looking for a super fresh and active scent.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because the package I received (from Navarro Online, not Amazon itself) was not in perfect shape. It looked like the metal container had been under pressure that caused it to grind against the silver coating of the box. When we opened it the container looked dirty :( It was actually the silver coating of the cardboard. I had given this to someone as a gift so it was a bit embarrassing when she opened the box and found it cosmetically imperfect. I though this was unacceptable at this price range. Also this (and all the reviews about this fragrance being discontinued) made me think mine might have come from a very old stock or even not have been authentic. Since I&#x27;ve had no previous experience with Emporio Armani She, there&#x27;s no way to tell!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Excelente 100% recomendable&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Don&amp;#34;t have the date expired</li>
    <li> Tried so many different brands over the years, always come back to my favorite one Emporio Armani. It matches me my body.</li>
    <li> Emporio Armani She is the best perfume in the world, thank you so much for my order. I love it and will buy more in the future.</li>
    <li> Best perfume for everyday use.Very good scent.Makes a good extra cologne for everyday use.I would recommend it for use everyday..Sorry for repeating myself just trying to comment the min amount of words req to rate a product.</li>
    <li> Gostei muito! Boa fixação.</li>
    <li> one of my favorite perfumes and can not fnd this in the store,breat price!</li>
