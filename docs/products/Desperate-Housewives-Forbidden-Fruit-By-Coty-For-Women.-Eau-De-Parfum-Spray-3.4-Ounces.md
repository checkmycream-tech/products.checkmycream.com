      <li>It does smell good but nothing special.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s Okay.  </li>
      <li>more once my two bottles are finished that I bought on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>

      <li>I am very picky with perfume and I am so happy I found this one.</li>
      <li>Light and fresh scent - love it!</li>
      <li>This perfume is fantastic.</li>
      <li>but this one has great mixed senses.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great gift idea for someone who loves the show, only I didn&#x27;t think about that the actual product is not that great (just like the show in my opinion).</li>
      <li>Do not buy this cheap stuff.</li>
      <li>It smells great all day long.</li>
      <li>I first bought a bottle of this from Macy&#x27;s just because of the name; however once I wore it, I fell in love with it.</li>
      <li>So, I was surprised when I smelled it and liked it.</li>
      <li>, I could smell the fruity scents mixed with flowers in it quite well, its a good fall and winter scent.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure a fresh product of this would smell nice, but i am not sure if they even make this any more and</li>
      <li>but if you put a little on then it smells great.</li>
      <li>I had to laugh when I saw this perfume at my big-lots.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure this was old stock, and the scratch and sniff sticker smelled much better than the actual product.</li>
      <li>like I did at first.</li>
      <li>Amazon purchased a lot of perfume returns and is selling them as first quality sealed products ...</li>
      <li>Its a very cheap scent as expected.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is really the smell of this.</li>
      <li>It is not for any real lady</li>
      <li>I really like the perfume</li>
      <li>Oneof those where if it werent made so cheaply would have nice notes to it but the overwhelming chepness to it makes you sick to your stomach.  </li>
      <li>Forbidden fruit is a fresh clean smell that you can wear all year long!!!!</li>
      <li>On amazon&#x27;s behalf, the refunded the whole order no questions asked, all i had to do was call them because it was out of the normal return policy.</li>
      <li>i is a little strong</li>
      <li>the copyright says 2006, so the stuff i had could have been up to 5 years old.</li>
      <li>Nice bottle, poorly boxed.</li>
      <li>I guess take your chances on this stuff, and i would not suggest buying from anyone other than amazon due to their extraordinary service in this transaction.</li>
      <li>I have no idea whether or not they will destroy the product or return it to inventory, so be aware that this bottle of juice may be yours next.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Light and fresh scent - love it!</li>
    <li> I have been wanting this perfume since it came on the market. I love it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this perfume on Amazon, but I wanted to leave a review anyway. I really like the perfume, I could smell the fruity scents mixed with flowers in it quite well, its a good fall and winter scent. It smells great all day long. I&#x27;ve gotten some nice compliments about it also. I totally recomend it, and I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> i is a little strong but if you put a little on then it smells great.</li>

    <li> I have loved this perfum since I smelled the sample in the Season 2 DVD collection. It comes in a giant bottle that lasts me a year. Some people have had a bad exprience buying this saying it smelled weird or it came used, but I did not have that exprience. The box it comes in is not wrapped in plastic like other perfums, but I have never seen it wrapped in plastic to begin with, I would recommend this to any one who loves DH or this perfum.</li>
    <li> I had to laugh when I saw this perfume at my big-lots. So, I was surprised when I smelled it and liked it. I got this product at big-lots for $4.20 a day after christmas(3.4 ounzes). I am very picky with perfume and I am so happy I found this one. I usually dont go for the musky perfume but this one has great mixed senses. Just wanted to leave a review so other people wont hesitate to try this, like I did at first.</li>
    <li> I sampled this at a department store and knew I had to have it. Scents of apple &amp; peach, then flowers, mellowing into a creamy base. I reminded me of a grown-up version of [[ASIN:B000JL69XC Exclamation By Coty For Women. Cologne Spray 1.7 OZ]]. I LOVED IT! Eventually I tracked it down here ....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon shipped an open box item ... no seal, protection, or manufacturer wrapping. Then I try a whiff of the juice only to find that it was all chemicals. No fruit, no flowers, just chemicals. After about 2 hours there was a slight hint of creamy vanilla chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what happened, but here are some theories ... Amazon shipped a bad, unsealed (returned?) product that was tampered with or had turned bad in heat/sun ... Amazon purchased a lot of perfume returns and is selling them as first quality sealed products ... I don&#x27;t know diddly squat about fragrances. You decide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To Amazon&#x27;s credit, they allowed me to return the item (which is NOT consistent with their return policy on fragrances) &amp; they paid for shipping. I have no idea whether or not they will destroy the product or return it to inventory, so be aware that this bottle of juice may be yours next.</li>
    <li> I first bought a bottle of this from Macy&#x27;s just because of the name; however once I wore it, I fell in love with it. Forbidden fruit is a fresh clean smell that you can wear all year long!!!! It is getting harder to find since the show is over. I will be looking for more once my two bottles are finished that I bought on Amazon. I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t nearly as good as I thought it would be based on reviews.  It does smell good but nothing special.</li>
    <li> This perfume is fantastic. You smell different notes each time you smell it. A mixture of herbal teas, fruits, spices, it&#x27;s very nice. I would wear it for casual wear and just around family or the house or casual get togethers when you want to smell nice but not be overpowering. It&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
    <li> Do not buy this cheap stuff. It stains your skin and has an offensive odour. It is not for any real lady</li>
    <li> for the price i must say this perfume was nice.</li>
    <li> This is an &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34; fragrance. It&#x27;s good for everyday use, very casual, and for the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong. Nice bottle, poorly boxed.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my friend who is a huge desperate housewives fan. It&#x27;s a great gift idea for someone who loves the show, only I didn&#x27;t think about that the actual product is not that great (just like the show in my opinion).</li>
    <li> Love the smell..can&#x27;t beat the price!!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume because its bot too strong and good to wear in the summer. I don&#x27;t like overpowering oil based or flower based perfumes so this i s perfect.</li>
    <li> The smell of this perfume Forbidden Fruit is so bad. I don&#x27;t know if this is really the smell of this. I can not stand it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Okay.  Would make a nice gift for cheap price.  Also, I like the bottle it came in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks !</li>
    <li> Tuccini seller is good but the perfume is not.  Its a very cheap scent as expected. Oneof those where if it werent made so cheaply would have nice notes to it but the overwhelming chepness to it makes you sick to your stomach.  One of those where you pass someone in public wearing it and think they are wearing some chemical, rather than perfume.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is much too heavy.  I can understand why it was discontinued. Wear this and you&#x27;ll smell like your great aunt.</li>
