    <li> Ordered as a gift for my daughter&#x27;s birthday. Curling iron is clever and so far working well. However, the promised bottle of styling oil wasn&#x27;t in the shipping container. Not a huge deal, but it&#x27;s annoying.</li>
    <li> I  purchased this curling iron for my 14 year old daughter and now she can curl her own hair easily. Concerned curling iron might get tangled in hair but it does not. I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this Amazon made it happen I give one star for Amazon&#x27;s help on getting this so when I received this product I. Just couldn&#x27;t wait to use it , oh my I couldn&#x27;t wait to return it , It didn&#x27;t work for me at all iwas very sad as it made it look so easy absolutely not I couldn&#x27;t figure this thing out maybe for someone that wants to spend an hour doing one curle then it didn&#x27;t even hold :(</li>
    <li> Wowee this makes great waves. I looked at some of the YouTube videos and got some tips. I can curl my long  hair under 5 minutes and it lasts for days. SO easy to use.</li>
    <li> It looks so easy in the video to use.  I can&#x27;t it to work like they show. Plus I burnt my hand trying to use it.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, I recommend!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t stop to from using it! I have A LOT of hair and I used to curl my hair in around one hour and 30 min and at the end I was complaining because I always got cramps in my arms. I bought this curler 2 months ago and I still can&#x27;t believe that it only takes 10 min for me to curl my entire hair without any pain or burn. It&#x27;s very easy to use it and it&#x27;s safe. I LOVE IT! (I don&#x27;t do reviews but this product absolutely deserves one).</li>
    <li> This is a great tool....I love it ..  I would highly recommend this curler ... Its easy to use and the results are amazing...I could be a spokes person for this product... I am a Cosmetologist .... it makes my job easier ...</li>
    <li> Love! Great curl. Watch tutorials for how to use, helps a lot. Super easy and quick!</li>
    <li> I am the most uncoordinated person ever to curl my own hair. I just can&#x27;t do it. I saw the Kiss Instawave and did some research on the different ones available. This one had the best reviews so I went ahead and ordered it. I absolutely love it! It is very easy to use and not time consuming at all! I didn&#x27;t even have to put product in my hair first to hold the curls. The curls stayed the entire day! I brought it with me this past weekend to my hair appointment for my hair dresser to check it out. She fell in love with it too after using it on my hair and is now going to order one for herself. This is such a great invention and well worth the money, even though it is cheaper than other ones on the market. I have recommended it to several friends and they all went out and purchased them.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and the curls came out really nice. I did not receive the free Argan hydration mask however.</li>
    <li> I am a stroke patient unable to use my right arm. I am still learning to use it and it is better than a curling iron.</li>
    <li> Perfect, easy to use!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas and she loves it! She won&#x27;t stop curling her hair, says it&#x27;s very easy to use.  Delivery right on time.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t use it because my hair was too short. My hair was shoulder length and it wouldn&#x27;t hold my hair to curl. I&#x27;ve since got it cut even shorter so I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll ever be able to use it.</li>
    <li> Great product, I love it!!! The curler is perfect and it does all I want it to do to my hair. It is quite easy to use and does not take long to style. I totally recommend it!!</li>
    <li> Hair gets tangles. Too difficult to do. Gave it away.</li>
    <li> I love it and it is very easy to use!!</li>
    <li> Returned. Doesn&#x27;t work on layered hair style.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Fast delivery.  Would order from again  A+</li>
