      <li>The description stated the product was new</li>
      <li>I wished I didn&#x27;t love this shampoo/conditioner so much because it is a little pricey, but after using it for 6 months, I couldn&#x27;t go back to cheaper conditioner.  </li>
      <li>And you only need a little bit for it to work its magic.</li>

<li> I have color-treated, very thick, long, dry &amp; curly hair and this conditioner makes it feel so healthy.  </li>
<li> Of course, it costs a pretty penny, but no other conditioner makes my long, thick Asian hair as silky as this one does.  </li>
<li> Addicted to this conditioner, if you have thick or dry hair this stuff works like magic!</li>
<li> I have super thin, but very long hair</li>
<li> lasts me a long time.  </li>
<li> I have long, waist length, curly hair</li>
<li> I can actually run a comb through my wet hair after washing without ripping out hunks of hair.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried every conditioner out there and this is the only one that untangles my coarse, thick hair and leaves it silky and soft.  </li>
<li> I was paying over $50 for the other brand and for a smaller bottle too.</li>
<li> When I saw the price for this half gallon size I decided to switch back to Pureology for a while.</li>
<li> Heads up, when you zoom in to view the actual half gallon bottle, it is for the shampoo.</li>
<li> I have very thick hair and even though I&#x27;m almost 60 yrs old, I look much younger.  </li>
<li> a little bit goes a long way!</li>
<li> It leaves my hair manageable and shiny without weighing it down.</li>
<li> I have been using for years my hair is thick and long</li>
<li> and so do my two little girls.  </li>
<li> This size can usually be purchased on Amazon for around $80.00 including the shipping.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;d been using another conditioner for the past year or so after being introduced to it by my hairdresser.</li>
<li> The 64oz jug lasts approximately 8 months with every other day use for the 3 of us.  </li>
<li> Before my hair was so thin, I could use a plastic fork to comb through it, but not anymore.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s expensive</li>
<li> She makes me buy it for her even though it is rather expensive.  </li>
<li> My hair falls out worse with this!</li>
<li> Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
<li> Hate it!!</li>

    <li> Great Product, makes your hair feel soft and does not irritate your scalp; definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> This Hair care product is awesome...It Hydrates your hair like no other.  As a matter of fact, it is the only Conditioner my wife will use. She makes me buy it for her even though it is rather expensive.  I live to please her and I have Purology to thank...</li>
    <li> Of course, it costs a pretty penny, but no other conditioner makes my long, thick Asian hair as silky as this one does.  After I use it, my hair is so shiny I don&#x27;t even need shine serum.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years and always get the 1/2 gallon because it comes with the handy pump and is a better value.</li>
    <li> Great product and customer service.  Thanks!</li>

    <li> Simply the best shampoo for your hair</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about the Pureology Hydrate conditioner.  I have color-treated, very thick, long, dry &amp; curly hair and this conditioner makes it feel so healthy.  I am able to brush my hair while wet with no problem.  It is cooling with peppermint smell and the 1/2 gallon with a pump lasts me a long time.  I will never use another conditioner as long as this is available.</li>

    <li> I wished I didn&#x27;t love this shampoo/conditioner so much because it is a little pricey, but after using it for 6 months, I couldn&#x27;t go back to cheaper conditioner.  It has been the most amazing transformation for my hair.  I have super thin, but very long hair and you could almost see my scalp when it was pulled back. After 6 months my hair doesn&#x27;t even feel the same.  It is so much stronger and healthier, I have been amazed.  Before my hair was so thin, I could use a plastic fork to comb through it, but not anymore.  I joke that having to use a real hair brush now is the downside of having healthy strong hair.  I get told all the time that I have beautiful hair ... and that didn&#x27;t happen before.  I originally got this for my daughter (who has thick hair) because she colors her hair so often and her hair dresser recommended it.  I know it sounds silly, but it really makes me feel better and more confident about myself.  Can&#x27;t recommend this enough!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product and it smells nice too.</li>

That is $10.00 a month for a product that keeps our hair healthy, shiny, and hydrated.  The fragrance is a wonderful, refreshing mint with a hint of flowers - not overpowering, just natural and pleasant.  On no-wash days I use a pea-sized dollup to freshen the fragrance in my hair and revive my curls. Love it and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
