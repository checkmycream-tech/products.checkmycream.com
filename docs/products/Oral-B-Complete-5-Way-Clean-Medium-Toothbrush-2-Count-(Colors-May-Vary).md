    <li> I won&#x27;t be getting these again.  The rubber pieces on the side fell off during my second use.  There are better tooth brushes out there, for sure.  Sorry for such a bad review, but i&#x27;m not overly fond of the taste of rubber.</li>
    <li> The best toothbrush I ever had</li>

    <li> Very pleased with this toothbrush.  The bristles are firm enough (solid medium) to feel like you&#x27;re really cleaning your teeth.  And on each side it has an extra set of even firmer bristles so the sides don&#x27;t cave in.  The head is medium in length so you can maneuver to thoroughly brush your back teeth as well. Will definitely buy this again.</li>
