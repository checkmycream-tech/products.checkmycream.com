      <li>Love this oil!</li>
      <li>if you&#x27;re OK with that, then give it a try!  </li>
      <li>Kind of has a smoky, tequila-ish smell, so</li>
      <li>I prefer to make my own.</li>

      <li>you&#x27;d like to make your own face lotion I recommend tallow.  </li>

      <li>I also make my own sunscreen by mixing it with coconut oil.</li>
      <li>oil is dense and effective for non aromatherapy.  </li>
      <li>DOES help if you mix it in a carrier oil of some kind</li>
      <li>/&gt;Update:  Just a word of caution, this oil is VERY strong.  </li>
      <li>The coconut oil has 4 spf on its own and combined with the carrot seed oil, it does better than the spf50 with all the chemicals I think.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s excellent for so many things; it&#x27;s good for facial skin care</li>
      <li>Love love love it!</li>

      <li>so I was glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Be sure to work in a well ventilated area.  </li>
      <li>To be on the safe side, you should cut it with coconut oil or the aloe vera oil, and you might want to try it that way first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much</li>
      <li>and I end up with a lovely air of freshness that people notice.  </li>
      <li>Keep out of eyes. :-)</li>

      <li>Fast shipping and good packaging from supplier--</li>
      <li>I agreed with the strong smell.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s been a HUGE saving grace for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a great essential oil!  </li>
      <li>I use it on my skin primarily for acne and it works wonders.</li>
      <li>Full of betacarotene and antioxidants .</li>
      <li>(my hubby greatly approves, he didn&#x27;t like other products I bought, but loves the smell of my homemade recipes).  </li>
      <li>After only 1 use mixed with my face wash, my sister and my mom were skyping with me and were commenting on how bright and better my skin looked....off of a video chat!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with the quality of this essential oil.</li>
      <li>My skin is so soft, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any fine lines yet!</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;m very fair, living in central Texas, I need sunscreen almost daily).  </li>
      <li>I reversed on my own, what I thought only injections and Dr. procedures would take care of!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle, it feels good, and obviously the skin likes it even if the nose doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>I figured it was worth a shot with the lower price.</li>
      <li>is so happening right now:) I have used young living, NOW, and edens garden along with plant theropy</li>
      <li>This essential oil is great for aging skin when mixed with a carrier oil like sweet almond, calendula, or coconut oil.</li>
      <li>Problem was easily rectified, and a new bottle is now being sent.</li>
      <li>use it in oil for facial (doesn&#x27;t smell appealing but suppose to be full of beta carotene)</li>
      <li>I mix the carrot seed oil with fennel oil and some lemon and sweet orange and tangerine oil, again from planet theropy, in some organic pure shea butter and coconut oil, whip it together</li>
      <li>I mix the carrot seed oil with fennel oil and some lemon and sweet orange and tangerine oil, again from planet theropy, in some organic pure shea butter and coconut oil, whip it together</li>
      <li>Very earthy smell but not unpleasant.</li>
      <li>The difference it is making in my aged, damaged skin is amazing.  </li>
      <li>First time using Carrot seed oil.</li>
      <li>Really, really!  </li>
      <li>smell is pretty rancid, which shouldn&#x27;t be the case.  </li>
      <li>this is the real thing!</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see them in 3 weeks in person and hear what they have to say after regular use:)</li>
      <li>use this Carrot oil primarily for two purposes:  a natural Sunscreen and skin appearance.  </li>
      <li>When nothing else cleared up a very irritated recurring rash on  my face, carrot seed oil did!</li>
      <li>One of my favorite essential oils for aging skin!</li>
      <li>have rather large bags under the eyes (genetics)</li>
      <li>I use it in my homemade, chemical and preservative free facial moisturizer and I can really see a difference in my skin tone and texture.  </li>
      <li>I have extremely sensitive skin, a rare form of abscessed rosacea that forms from almost everything I use on my face.</li>
      <li>It is very concentrated</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t found it available locally</li>
      <li>I sealed the bottle and put in a box and resealed with so much packaging tape.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>I got the item today, It was shipped extremely fast.</li>
      <li>This stings, so use with caution and very sparingly.</li>
      <li>I really like this company&#x27;s service and products</li>
      <li>highly recommend this carrot oil.  </li>
      <li>so high</li>
      <li>for the carrot seed oil, it is high quality from plant theropy.</li>
      <li>I HIGHLY recommend this carrot oil.  </li>
      <li>(That works fine for the rest of the face, but do be careful.....</li>
      <li>but hey, the awesomeness of it outways that little misshap:)</li>
      <li>Musky, musty and more than a little rancid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It does have a slight smell to it, not so much carrot as a strong herbal smell.  </li>
      <li>(I like the Dr. Adorable Aloe Vera oil) and throw in a few drops of Lemon oil or some other essential oil, to kind of cover up that smell.  </li>
      <li>You dont need very much, be aware essential oils are a VERY concentrated form of the essence of the plant.  </li>
      <li>it has an effect that is deep and dense that will drive you right into your body, if you have a tendency toward not.</li>
      <li>Try their products with confidence; these essential oils are very reasonably priced and are of the highest quality proven by their effectiveness.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love it . It met my skin needs . Quality product i cannt do without it in my skin care regimen. Full of betacarotene and antioxidants . Helps to get rid of aun spots and provides 40spf factor. Every morning i add to drops to my my foundation or simply add to my moisturizer.</li>
    <li> exactly what i expected.</li>
    <li> From Queen Anne&#x27;s Lace, and for some might be turned off by smell, earthy, kind of medicinal, but if you mix with a base to use, can add essential oil.&lt;br /&gt;Really tones the skin and feels good. First time using Carrot seed oil.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the quality of this essential oil. It is very concentrated so I only use a few drops.  It is useful to have this in your personal essential oil kit. I haven&#x27;t found it available locally so I was glad to find it on Amazon. Shipping was fast and efficient, too from Plant Therapy Essential Oils.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This oil might be just fine, but the smell of it makes me nauseous.  I wanted to use it in to make some sunscreen, but it makes me feel so sick I&#x27;m afraid to open it again!</li>
    <li> This essential oil is great for aging skin when mixed with a carrier oil like sweet almond, calendula, or coconut oil.</li>
    <li> Quickly received, half of the oil was in the box it came in. Problem was easily rectified, and a new bottle is now being sent. I love Plant Therapy Oils.</li>
    <li> This exceeded my expectations. I use it on my skin primarily for acne and it works wonders. I also make my own sunscreen by mixing it with coconut oil. I&#x27;ve used it to put directly on a sunburn to soothe and get rid of the burn almost over night with no peeling. Used on 1st and 2nd degree autoimmune disease skin burns to help heal skin. Heals chapped elbows with daily use. Heals skin sores that don&#x27;t like to go away. I&#x27;ll never me without this. This stings, so use with caution and very sparingly. I use full strength with no problem, but I had to learn that less is plenty. Keep out of eyes. :-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to use this oil to make my own sunscreen. If it doesn&#x27;t work, then I&#x27;ll be purchasing Native American Naturals EO. I figured it was worth a shot with the lower price.</li>
    <li> I got the item today, It was shipped extremely fast. I agreed with the strong smell. It smells like the carrot leaves more than carrot. Yes, It smells but seems to be concentrated, not diluted with other oil as filler. I put a couple of drops in my face cream and put it on my face today. I have not seen the result yet. I will give an update after a month.</li>
    <li> Love Price seems great quality.</li>
    <li> I have been using carrot seed essential oil in a carrier oil for only a few days.  The difference it is making in my aged, damaged skin is amazing.  I can ignore the smell after witnessing the results.  If days make such a difference in the appearance and feel of my skin, I&#x27;m anxious to see the progress after weeks and months of use.</li>
    <li> I am not sure how well this item actually works--I&#x27;ve read that if you can get past the smell, it does wonders for your hair and skin when applied topically.  However, I cannot overstate how bad this stuff smells.  After, putting some on my face (unfortunately close to my nose), I tried to cover it up with coconut oil to no avail.  Kind of has a smoky, tequila-ish smell, so if you&#x27;re OK with that, then give it a try!  I personally chose not to use it after my first attempt.  Fast shipping and good packaging from supplier--no complaints at all there!</li>
    <li> A very smelly essential oil.  Using it for my husbands sun damaged skin and started using it myself.  10 drops carrot, a quarter cup coconut oil and some argan oil, has helped our aged, dry skin.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t knew this oil before, but his properties claimed my attention. So i  gave him to show me his capacity. I use it in combination with helichrysum oil hoping to vanish sun damages of my skin. I will report in the future, if its worked.</li>
    <li> Love love love it! I added it to my oil mixture for cleansing as well as to my facial moisturizing oil.  My skin is so soft, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any fine lines yet! It does have a strong smell, but I don&#x27;t find it unpleasant.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used Tisserand oils but they don&#x27;t sell all of their products in USA anymore and with the exchange rate with England so high I decided to try different brand--so far it seems comparable.</li>
    <li> Love this oil! I use it in my homemade, chemical and preservative free facial moisturizer and I can really see a difference in my skin tone and texture.  I also use it on my scalp in a vinegar rinse.  Very earthy smell but not unpleasant.</li>
    <li> This is a great essential oil!  It&#x27;s excellent for so many things; it&#x27;s good for facial skin care and it&#x27;s great for depression too.  I blend it with other essential oils in my diffuser; I love breathing in the different aromas.  I would definitely recommend this oil.</li>
    <li> smell is pretty rancid, which shouldn&#x27;t be the case.  oil is dense and effective for non aromatherapy.  so, as a skin care product, it&#x27;s 4-4.5 stars, 1.5 stars for aromatherapy.</li>
    <li> When nothing else cleared up a very irritated recurring rash on  my face, carrot seed oil did! I have yet to be disappointed in Plant Therapy essential oils. Try their products with confidence; these essential oils are very reasonably priced and are of the highest quality proven by their effectiveness.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent pure seed oil product and sold at a very good price. Use in a skin serum formula and worked beautifully. Thanks.</li>
    <li> use it in oil for facial (doesn&#x27;t smell appealing but suppose to be full of beta carotene) so I stick to it</li>
    <li> One of my favorite essential oils for aging skin!</li>
    <li> I received this product in a very quick time and found it to be of very fine quality. I really like this company&#x27;s service and products</li>
    <li> quality of carrot seed oil is very important. it has an effect that is deep and dense that will drive you right into your body, if you have a tendency toward not. any artificiality is detectable. this is the real thing!</li>
    <li> I bought this to use for sunscreen on my face.  It worked great no sunburn and great for skin.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this oil! I have been using oils for almost 8 mnths now and am so thankful for them! I have partially paralyzed intestines from surgery and only using the bathroom 3 times every 2 weeks with the help of yucky chemical meds:( but with essential oils, I go 3 times a day with no meds!!!!! What the Dr&#x27;s said was impossible is so happening right now:) I have used young living, NOW, and edens garden along with plant theropy and I would have to say I perfer either plant theropy or edens garden. I am actually amost out of my peppermint and grapefruit oils with YL and will be reordering them from plant theropy not YL. I love that you can get the 30ml bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the carrot seed oil, it is high quality from plant theropy. After only 1 use mixed with my face wash, my sister and my mom were skyping with me and were commenting on how bright and better my skin looked....off of a video chat! I can&#x27;t wait to see them in 3 weeks in person and hear what they have to say after regular use:) I have extremely sensitive skin, a rare form of abscessed rosacea that forms from almost everything I use on my face. Through trial and error I have learned to use 2 aspirin with a touch of lemon juice and 2 drops of carrot seed oil into a paste. I put it on to cover my face and neck and leave on to dry for about 20 min to let the oil really seep in and then rinse with cold water. No allergic reaction and I do this twice a week and water only day and night the rest of the week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also am a 2 year surviver, at only 30 years old, of melanoma but because of my allergies I can&#x27;t use sunblock so there is no wonder I am in love with carrot seed oil! I mix about 24 drops in with about 1 cup coconut oil, melted, mix it up and let harden in a leak proof jar and I am good to go. The coconut oil has 4 spf on its own and combined with the carrot seed oil, it does better than the spf50 with all the chemicals I think. I will also be adding more oils to my next batch as I am learning of other oils to use with spf properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I know this oil is great! I mix the carrot seed oil with fennel oil and some lemon and sweet orange and tangerine oil, again from planet theropy, in some organic pure shea butter and coconut oil, whip it together and it is the best lotion! It also super helps with toning the skin and cellulite, especially on the back of my legs and under my butt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only negative is I am not super fond of the smell of the carrot seed oil when it is under my nose with the face wash. Anytime else it doesn&#x27;t bother me but hey, the awesomeness of it outways that little misshap:)ing of other oils to use with spf properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I know this oil is great! I mix the carrot seed oil with fennel oil and some lemon and sweet orange and tangerine oil, again from planet theropy, in some organic pure shea butter and coconut oil, whip it together and it is the best lotion! It also super helps with toning the skin and cellulite, especially on the back of my legs and under my butt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only negative is I am not super fond of the smell of the carrot seed oil when it is under my nose with the face wash.

    <li> I purchase a mix of Plant Therapy and Eden&#x27;s Garden oils.  Between these brands, I&#x27;ve begun to collect a wonderful assortment of great oils that are cost appropriate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this Carrot oil primarily for two purposes:  a natural Sunscreen and skin appearance.  I finally found a way to add a natural sunscreen ingredient to my homemade products.  Carrot oil has about a 40 spf rating.  I make almost everything i put on my body!  I&#x27;ve been using these oils for months now and really love the way they work.  I&#x27;ve noticed my face is a LOT less sun affected after being outside.  (I&#x27;m very fair, living in central Texas, I need sunscreen almost daily).  With a combo of my homemade tallow for my face and the addition of these wonderful oils, my face hasn&#x27;t looked better.  Even vastly improved over what I was going to my dermatologist of 10+ years for!  Crows feet are gone, my skin is smoother, and pores greatly reduced, all with my homemade product.  Carrot oil has an &#x27;anti-aging&#x27; effect.  I can attest to that.  I reversed on my own, what I thought only injections and Dr. procedures would take care of!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this carrot oil.  It does have a slight smell to it, not so much carrot as a strong herbal smell.  I combine this with other oils for scent: lavender, patchouli, frankincense....  I love the way my homemade products smell.  All natural, they meld well with my body and I end up with a lovely air of freshness that people notice.  (my hubby greatly approves, he didn&#x27;t like other products I bought, but loves the smell of my homemade recipes).  I HIGHLY recommend this carrot oil.  It&#x27;s been a HUGE saving grace for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(If you&#x27;d like to make your own face lotion I recommend tallow.  Look online for a &#x27;how to&#x27;.  My skin has been vastly improved, and adding oils like this one, just adds to the effectiveness of the product.  You dont need very much, be aware essential oils are a VERY concentrated form of the essence of the plant.  Be sure to work in a well ventilated area.  Otherwise you might find the vapors to be overwhelming, causing dizziness or nausea.)Be sure to work in a well ventilated area.

    <li> I use a ton of sunblock, so when it&#x27;s not for my face I prefer to make my own. This I added for its antioxidant properties. It imparts a reedy scent but it&#x27;s all good.</li>
    <li> Smells like the whiff of that soft mushy rot that developed on the carrot that you forgot in the bottom of the refrigerator bin for a month. Musky, musty and more than a little rancid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why on earth would I give it five stars......?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have rather large bags under the eyes (genetics) and if I hold my nose and apply the &amp;#34;tiniest&amp;#34; drop to the soft bags and wrinkles at the corners of the eyes, they go away for the day.  Really, really!  They shrink down to nothing!  It&#x27;s gentle, it feels good, and obviously the skin likes it even if the nose doesn&#x27;t.  It is visibly healing the damage I did to my skin when I was young and stupid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It DOES help if you mix it in a carrier oil of some kind (I like the Dr. Adorable Aloe Vera oil) and throw in a few drops of Lemon oil or some other essential oil, to kind of cover up that smell.  (That works fine for the rest of the face, but do be careful.....you don&#x27;t want to get Lemon oil near your eyes - it will sting.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I can&#x27;t argue with these results, so stinky face, here I come!&lt;br /&gt;(The smell does fade away after a few minutes. Chuckle!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  Just a word of caution, this oil is VERY strong.  When I suggested using a tiny drop of full strength oil, I did mean VERY tiny. (As in:  the tip of a toothpick.)  If you slap a few drops of undiluted oil on the bags under your eyes the fumes will have you crying for a good twenty minutes.  To be on the safe side, you should cut it with coconut oil or the aloe vera oil, and you might want to try it that way first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much later update:  Yeah, you just want to put a few drops of this into 30 ml of blended carrier oil.  It works almost as well, doesn&#x27;t cause you to cry when you use it from the fumes, and lasts a lot longer.</li>
    <li> I received the package with the rose hip oil, beeswax and this carrot seed oil. When I picked up the box from the front door, I immediately knew there&#x27;s something in there that smelled like rotten vegetable in your refrigerator bin.  When I opened the box everyone in my family asked what the heck was that.  My son thought it smelled like a dead person. I thought it was just earthy smell. The bottle leaked through the box and I believe it spilled at least 15% of the content.  I sealed the bottle and put in a box and resealed with so much packaging tape. When I woke up in the morning to check it, the room where the box was so smelly!  I will have to try to see the benefit of this oil, but for now it deserves a 2-star for the packaging.  I will update later.</li>
    <li> I think this has helped my skin. I think the smell is great! I use it in a Sugar scrub with olive oil.</li>
