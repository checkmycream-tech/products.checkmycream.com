      <li>These are a great options for sensitive skin and are sold at an excellent price for a dozen.</li>
      <li>Great price, smooth shave.</li>
      <li>Nice balance of a quality product for the price, but</li>
      <li>Nice design for hard-to-get-to areas.</li>
      <li>After using multy blades these kind of suck.  </li>

      <li>great shave, as good as Gillette and much cheaper too..</li>
      <li>I was first introduced to this razor as a giveaway at Great Clips.</li>
      <li>blade clean button at the top is good too.</li>
      <li>Very smooth and close</li>
      <li>My husband&#x27;s favorite razors.</li>
      <li>I can shave quicker with better and smoother results with the Gillette.  </li>
      <li>and I think he looks better in a beard.  </li>
      <li>i would rather spend more money but get something of quality.</li>
      <li>This razor also is a much better razor than this Schick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Dual-blade technology is better than triple-</li>
      <li>I will order more.</li>
      <li>It looks cheap but the blades are amazing.</li>
      <li>okay shaves from one.</li>
      <li>Finally figured out the best method is to place the lubricating strip on your face and trust the angle.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t gotten as many shaves per razor as I once did; that&#x27;s why 4 instead of 5 stars.</li>
      <li>One could spend a lot more $$ for disposal razors, but they will not do any better a job than these Schick ST2 razors.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know why we need so many blades.......</li>
      <li>, jesus i felt like i could have got a better shave</li>
      <li>This brand of razors is just okay.</li>
      <li>I will be purchasing more for sure.</li>
      <li>Gives a close shave and you feel like you are more safe with 2 blades</li>
      <li>I say it works better than the 4 or 5 blade on the market, I find those pull the hair and cause pain when used.  </li>
      <li>These are my favorite razors.</li>
      <li>, the 2-blade ST2 makes the overly-complicated Quattro handle like an Edsel in a Grand Prix.</li>
      <li>If you are an &amp;#34;occasional shaver&amp;#34; that lets your beard come in for more than a couple of days I would recommend another blade.</li>
      <li>sometimes more.</li>
      <li>&quot; The top has a sort of button that when depressed, releases schmootz in the razor&#x27;s head.</li>
      <li>is more... and cheaper.</li>
      <li>but on the top of my head.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;d think that 4 blades, made by Schick, of all shaving powerhouses, would be a better choice.</li>
      <li>I give them three stars, because they are inexpensive, and both my wife and daughter use them, and are satisfied.  </li>
      <li>, the 2-blade ST2 makes the overly-complicated Quattro handle like an Edsel in a Grand Prix.kes balancing the sideburns extremely easy, and easiest of all blades</li>
      <li>I am glad it is available here.</li>
      <li>He uses these with a sensitive shave gel and they work great.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll get four good uses - smooth results, gentle on skin - after that it will shread your face to bits.</li>
      <li>Very sharp and perfect for lining up my beard.</li>
      <li>if you are fine with about three shaves per razor then go for it.  </li>
      <li>ADDING BLADES IS LIKE PUTTING 6-8 TIRES ON YOUR CAR, WHEN 4 WILL WORK JUST FINE.</li>
      <li>They are fine for my needs, too.  </li>
      <li>I buy these in store all the time and would be just fine with the product</li>
      <li>work fine and do the job.</li>
      <li>They are perfect for getting into the little places.  </li>
      <li>I sent these to the Charlotte County Florida Homeless Coalition for distribution, they worked out fine and were very economical.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve used these for years - comfortable shave ,</li>
      <li>Even with generous tapping under a running faucet, it gets so easily clogged that I cease getting a clean shave and end up</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Just about gets the job done. I much prefer Gillette&#x27;s disposable razors (same price at costco).... cleaner shaves, sturdier razors.</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive skin and occassional breakouts, these are it!</li>
    <li> WORST. RAZORS. EVER.&lt;br /&gt;Schick? Really?&lt;br /&gt;Are we just livin&#x27; off the name now?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a furry person.  I shave every day, even if I don&#x27;t &amp;#34;have&amp;#34; to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These things are just AWFUL. Didn&#x27;t cause any knicks or cuts,  because they can&#x27;t cut ANYTHING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a close shave, your toaster will do a better job than these little wastes of money.  &#x3D;^..^&#x3D;</li>
    <li> Quality razors great price</li>
    <li> These razors are sharp and last for multiple shavings. I didn&#x27;t check prices in the local store to see if they were a good deal or not.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these for years - comfortable shave , good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad to get them thru Amazon.</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED THESE BLADES FOR YEARS AND WOULD RECOMMEND THEM OVER ANY 3 OR 4 BLADE RAZOR BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT 3 OR 4 IS NOT A BETTER SHAVE FOR THE MONEY AND IT CAN GET INTO THOSE TIGHT SPOTS BETTER</li>
    <li> Not a fan. After using multy blades these kind of suck.  At least for me, just don&#x27;t do well, get clogged up, dull, takes forver.</li>
    <li> I used these way back in college.  I didn&#x27;t know how much I missed that little button to push out the whiskers between the blades until I went searching on Amazon, by chance, for this razor.  I mean: were they still around??  I got tired of banging other razors against the sink or shower wall to get the stubborn whisker build-up out from between the blades.  The Mach III was a good razor, but now 4-, 5-, and 6-Blade (!!) razors are just...overkill.  Plus, I hate spending a lot of money on disposable razors, but after trying cheapos from discount markets that tore my face up, I looked for something name brand again.  I reunited with these and found them to be simple and efficient, which is fine with me!  My beard is pretty tough, but one of these razors lasts for weeks.  Quite an impressive and cost-effective razor!</li>
    <li> Inconsistent quality control results in some dull razors from time to time. I ended up throwing away a few. When they are right, they are the best I have found. The narrow head size makes it easy to get into tight areas around the nose for example.</li>
    <li> I have a hard beard and a sensitive skin and this shavers do the job very well lasting quite a few shaves each.</li>
    <li> Maybe I got a bad batch, but when you have to stand there in front of the mirror repeatedly running this shaver across your chin, and then again, for a reasonably clean shave, there is definitely something wrong. Thinking that a company like Schick had been perfecting razors roughly since tree ferns dominated the earth, I had thought this shaver would be at least one step up from my generic supermarket brand. Alas, not so.</li>
    <li> Razors work as expected, are sharp ,and get the job done. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly. Good product, great price. I will order more.</li>
    <li> The razors don&#x27;t last. Nor do they give a close shave.</li>
    <li> good product ... as expected.</li>
    <li> My facial is very thick so these shavers won&#x27;t last me for nothing.... but the razor cuts my facial hair really deep which I wanted... so this product does work... but don&#x27;t expect it to last long</li>
    <li> I decided to give this razor a shot being cheaper than my normal Gillette razors. Like the saying goes you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very disappointed with the quality of this razor.  Compared to my normal Gillette Custom Plus razor there is no contest.  This Schick razor is cheap.  It dulls after only a few times of use whereas the Gillette razor can be used several times before being discarded.  It also seems that this Schick razor has shorter blades and doesn&#x27;t give as close a shave as the Gillette.  I can shave quicker with better and smoother results with the Gillette.  Before I started using the Gillette Customer Plus I used Gillette&#x27;s economical &amp;#34;Good News&amp;#34; razor.  This razor also is a much better razor than this Schick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone has their preference but I will never purchase another Schick razor.  I will stick with what works best!</li>
    <li> These do a very good job. Smooth shave, no cuts, last several shaves which make them a good value for the price.</li>
    <li> I did not like this kind of razors :P, brought them for my Father, he loves them!</li>
    <li> Smooth razor for the first few shaves but is creating a lot of shaving rash from cutting too close after 6 or so shaves.  That is just the opposite of most razors where they cut closer and rash more at first.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, I usually go for Bic 3 Blade but the grocery store was out so I thought I&#x27;d try these and I cannot wait until they are gone. It takes multiple swipes at different angles unlike the Bic where it was one stroke. I don&#x27;t have thick facial hair and it tears and pulls so hard around my chin where it&#x27;s thickest. Anyone with full facial hair stay away from these!!!!</li>
    <li> Garbage! Buy real ones, from the store. Not worth the savings.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for over 3 years to travel with...they give me a close shave and last through at least 2 - 3 sahves...I recommend them highly...</li>
    <li> My husband can&#x27;t believe how well these blades cut.  He says it is foolish to buy pricier razors because these do a great job.  They are fine for my needs, too.  I use one for over a month or weekly shavings.</li>
    <li> horrible. they don&#x27;t shave anything and i ended up with scales and blood!!! a waste of money. i would rather spend more money but get something of quality.</li>
    <li> Best disposable razors on the market! The cleaning mechanism between the blades is genius!</li>
    <li> Disappointed with the name brand &amp;#34;Schick.&amp;#34;  Went with the name brand and these\&lt;br /&gt;things couldn&#x27;t cut 2 day stubble.</li>
    <li> Good value. Great disposables.</li>
    <li> great shave, as good as Gillette and much cheaper too..</li>
    <li> Nice balance of a quality product for the price, but I haven&#x27;t gotten as many shaves per razor as I once did; that&#x27;s why 4 instead of 5 stars. I don&#x27;t think my facial hair has changed, so I can&#x27;t explain why they don&#x27;t seem to go as far as they once did. That said, it&#x27;s still a good deal. Nice design for hard-to-get-to areas. I&#x27;ve been using these for my curvy chin. I then use a higher quality, more expensive razor for the rest of my face. But these outperform that expensive on (a 5-blader) on the chin area.</li>
    <li> I like these razors.  I have tried a single blade and they are horrible so I thought I would try the 2 blade.  I say it works better than the 4 or 5 blade on the market, I find those pull the hair and cause pain when used.  I get 2-4 uses per razor using it on my face, as I do not have a lot of hair.  I shave once a week normally or once every 5 days.  Hope this review helps.</li>
    <li> Did not shave nothing!</li>
    <li> Works well for me.  Design could be better:&lt;br /&gt;1) If the green cushion does not get washed way after a few use.&lt;br /&gt;2) If the trapped hair can be removed more effortnessly around the white supports.&lt;br /&gt;3) If it does not cut you once a while.</li>
    <li> Exceptional delivery!</li>
    <li> I HAVE A BEARD, THIS IS THE CLOSEST I CAN BUY TO A &amp;#34;ONE&amp;#34; BLADE RAZOR FOR TRIMMING, THEY WORK WELL BUT I WOULD STILL PREFER A SINGLE BLADE SCHICK.............IT WOULD MAKE MY MORNINGS EASIER.........ADDING BLADES IS LIKE PUTTING 6-8 TIRES ON YOUR CAR, WHEN 4 WILL WORK JUST FINE.</li>
    <li> Thought this would be a good option for my husband, however they do not last more than 1 or two shaves.  The cost was good but product not good enough.</li>
    <li> Have looked for these razors in the store for months before finally finding them on Amazon. They have a small plastic button on the top of the razor that, when pushed, frees the razor from any clogs. A simple solution to a common problem with multi-blade razors that other manufacturers have either overlooked or ignored.</li>
    <li> My husband says these only last for one or two shavings.  The last time he shaved with these he got a razor burn bad enough to quit shaving and re-grow his beard.  Personally I&#x27;m pretty happy with this painful turn of events as I really like his beard and I think he looks better in a beard.  I gave these one star for my husband and one star for me, hee hee!</li>
    <li> Best value razors I have ever used.  They don&#x27;t rust right away and are easy to clear for multiple shaves.</li>
    <li> I get one or two shaves and then these go really dull.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;d think that 4 blades, made by Schick, of all shaving powerhouses, would be a better choice. For me, not so:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have one hell of a tough beard stubble. It will never be anything other than spiney, sharp, tough and capable of shredding shirt collars, paper and even making a slightly sognificant sanding surface to soft wood. Those pretty fellers on TV who sport a 3-day shadow to look tough? They don&#x27;t know a tough face, my grandfather&#x27;s face, and I have his wirey growth from my face, eyebrows, nose, ears; everywhere but on the top of my head. So let&#x27;s split some hairs:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shaved one half of my face, warmed with warm water and foam overall, with Schick&#x27;s 5 bladed Quattro Titanium. This overload of sharp steel features 4 blades for the shave and one on the top edge for exacting sideburns and whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Quattro Titanium fails. It gets clogged with stubble. Even with generous tapping under a running faucet, it gets so easily clogged that I cease getting a clean shave and end up THINKING I&#x27;ve cleaned my face to find it virtually ungroomed. I kid you not. Despite 4 blades, they are placed into a wide head but too tight to let the cut stuff escape. A \\&quot;good\\&quot; shave would require multiple passes and lots of cleaning, either with a q-tip or an old toothbrush to loosen up, if possible, your expelled cuttings. For me, I&#x27;ve had morings with more scratches than expected due to cuttings being redragged across a now-softened surface. OUCH!&lt;br /&gt;The wide head does not work well into tight areas like around or over ears, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the 2-blade ST2, also from Schick:&lt;br /&gt;Less is more... and cheaper. The ST2 packs are double bladed razors with a secret\\&quot; The top has a sort of button that when depressed, releases schmootz in the razor&#x27;s head. It is lighter, thinner amd can manuever under the schnoze, into my ears for hair growth, and even thin enough to be rotated in nostrals for a safe removal of some nasal hair. The thinner blade head makes balancing the sideburns extremely easy, and easiest of all blades I&#x27;ve used to clean and continue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cost of Schick&#x27;s ST2s is much less -a dozen blades vs 3 or 4 Quattros- and delivers a more managable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the buck, for the accuracy, for the straightforwardness of a simple, clean shave, surprise, the 2-blade ST2 makes the overly-complicated Quattro handle like an Edsel in a Grand Prix.kes balancing the sideburns extremely easy, and easiest of all blades I&#x27;ve used to clean and continue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cost of Schick&#x27;s ST2s is much less -a dozen blades vs 3 or 4 Quattros- and delivers a more managable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the buck, for the accuracy, for the straightforwardness of a simple, clean shave, surprise, the 2-blade ST2 makes the overly-complicated Quattro handle like an Edsel in a Grand Prix.</li>
    <li> I used to buy disposable razors from Target. These last a little longer have a better shave. Cost wise these are in the same price range as other disposables.</li>
    <li> I bought these after bugging my eyes out on thousands of reviews. These were supposed to be the bomb. They&#x27;re not. These are lightweight, one-use-only deals. You can find some just as good (or bad) at your local dollar store. Having 12 of something this nasty is not a bonus.</li>
    <li> they slice the hair off of my skin with the utmost precision</li>
    <li> Best razors I have ever had and I have tried LOTS over the years, including some at 3 times the price. I dry shave, and zip zip zip .. clean without a bit of pain. My roommates now swear by them. You will be clean, happy and lookin&#x27; gooooood !!</li>
    <li> the product was broken over half of them was broken at the top were the razor was connected to the handle</li>
    <li> Razor burn. Everywhere. You DO NOT want to know.</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to this razor as a giveaway at Great Clips. After trying several types of high-end alternatives I&#x27;ve come back to these. They give me a close, painless shave which allows me to edge my beard closely and I save a ton versus the high end options.</li>
    <li> Bought these at my local Kroger and was not really pleased with the results. I often go over my beard with an electric razor first then apply the shaving cream and shave with the disposable razor. These were struggling to shave off all of the hair on my face. Keep in mind that the hairs were not long nor thick since I already went over my beard once with an electric razor. The shave is not close at all and strays hairs were left all over my face. The positives are that there wasn&#x27;t any pulling.</li>
    <li> As sharp as Gillette, but less expensive. These are disposable so don&#x27;t expect the same results as the multi-blade razors.</li>
    <li> I like to regularly replace my razors to avoid shaving bumps. These are a great options for sensitive skin and are sold at an excellent price for a dozen. Dual-blade technology is better than triple- or quadruple- in my experience, which I feel over-exfoliate. If you&#x27;re concerned about your appearance but smart enough to know that the smooth &#x27;feel&#x27; is a critical variable (you just have to look clean shaven), then you&#x27;re likely to agree that this is an awesome, cost-effective choice for your personal razor.</li>
    <li> This razor is adequate but nothing like the excellent razor I had been using from a supply I bought in 2010.  Same model number different razor.&lt;br /&gt;Handle is not as stiff....blades are not as sharp and the clean out bar does not function as well.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll get four good uses - smooth results, gentle on skin - after that it will shread your face to bits.</li>
    <li> Great price for a good product.</li>
    <li> The best disposable razor i have found. Lasts for several shaves. Even as it wears out in continues to shaves without cutting up your skin. The thin design allows neat cuts on sideburns and mustaches.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good. I like it.</li>
    <li> Only razor my husband will use</li>
    <li> I buy these in store all the time and would be just fine with the product but when they arrived 10 out of 12 razors had the blade/head portion broken off of the handle as they were packed with several other heavy items in one giant box.  Options were to go find smaller box, drive to UPS drop-off location and return them or just eat the $7.</li>
    <li> I give it 3 stars for basically being as advertised. They are decent quality, but light-weight and didn&#x27;t handle thick stubble. Shaving is different for everyone, so if you are looking for an inexpensive option you might give them a try. If you are an &amp;#34;occasional shaver&amp;#34; that lets your beard come in for more than a couple of days I would recommend another blade.</li>
    <li> I sent these to the Charlotte County Florida Homeless Coalition for distribution, they worked out fine and were very economical.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite razors. They shave without nicking.  They last a long time, weeks for me. They give a much closer shave than other razors with more blades.  The narrow head is good for getting into tight places.  For some reason this excellent razor has become difficult to find in my area.  I am glad it is available here.</li>
    <li> BOUGHT THESE BLADES FOR MY HUSBAND HE ALSO LOVED THEM SO WHEN I SAW THIS DEAL I GRAB IT. GOT THEM ON TIME WITH NO PROBLEM. WOULD PURCHASE AGAIN. THANKS</li>
    <li> Inexpensive. Unfortunately, they begin to rust after a shave or two.</li>
    <li> Great razor for the price.</li>
    <li> Not that Great,in my opinion.This brand of razors is just okay.It did something,but not what i wanted it to do.I get that it&#x27;s for sensitive use,but way too sensitive.It did not do do much of anything,therefore i was unsatisfied with the results.I will have to try another brand.I can&#x27;t recommend,because this is not a product i would buy again.</li>
    <li> Hard to find these now, the cleaning feature is great.</li>
    <li> Love these razors especially for the price</li>
    <li> This arrived in pieces, with the blade assembly separated from the handle.  Some of the blade assemblies broken.  I could not assemble any of the parts to make them functional.  Recommend buying this item from your local store where you can see what it is you are getting.  Too much hassle to return.</li>
    <li> Excellent disposable razors. I have very sensitive skin and get razor burn almost every time I shave. These are great sharp razors with two blades. I have less irritation while using these than I do with other brands.</li>
    <li> These fail to remove hair from your face fully - even after multiple strokes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand they&#x27;re inexpensive and made for sensitive skin but are no where near sharp enough to create a presentable look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go for something a notch above or you&#x27;ll regret it. I&#x27;m now stuck with a whole bag of these worthless peach-fuzz blades.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know why we need so many blades.......TWO IS ENOUGH!&lt;br /&gt;These work fine and do the job.</li>
    <li> At times they do make me break up when use them.... Not to bad but i will not be getting more of them anytime soon!!</li>
    <li> never tried them like them</li>
    <li> I will admit, I have a very heavy beard. (I normally use DE blades.)  If I start with a 12-18 hour old beard, and shave an average of 3 times every 2 days, I could probably get a few okay shaves from one. If I start with a day and a half old beard, I will throw a brand new one away after one shave.  I give them three stars, because they are inexpensive, and both my wife and daughter use them, and are satisfied.  They are not bad, but not good either.</li>
    <li> They are what they are...</li>
    <li> Good price, but for me blades only last two shaves. Most brands last four.</li>
    <li> My husband likes these 2-blades razors.  They are perfect for getting into the little places.  Plus, they last a long while.  I have been buying him these razors for years.  He won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite razors.</li>
    <li> fast delivered!! good price</li>
    <li> Great price, smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Great razor,  great price</li>
    <li> I chose these razors because they were cheaper than usual razors you buy at retail stores.  After my husband used the first one, he said to not ever buy those razors again.  They did not shave close to skin and actually irritated his face.  I guess its true that you get what you pay for!!!</li>
    <li> They get the job done. and they arrived fast</li>
    <li> One could spend a lot more $$ for disposal razors, but they will not do any better a job than these Schick ST2 razors.  I have a very heavy beard and these razors give me a very close shave.</li>
    <li> Initially wanted to give this razor a 3 star but changed to 4 star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The schick blade angle is very different than bic, gillette or noxzema.  The angle on your face does not work if attempting to shave the razor parallel to your face as with most razors.  Finally figured out the best method is to place the lubricating strip on your face and trust the angle.  Very smooth and close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shall not buy again since I prefer the Noxzema pivoting head dual disposables.</li>
    <li> Terrible razors. Didn&#x27;t realize how much of a difference a pivoting head made until we tried these. The razor definitely is NOT for &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; men. Really awful product.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Awesome disposable razors. Very sharp and perfect for lining up my beard. I can get 2 shaves out of one razor. They were cheaper on amazon then I typically pay at target.</li>
    <li> Schick ST2 Disposable Razor Sensitive for Men, 12 Count&lt;br /&gt;by Schick&lt;br /&gt;give me a smooth and comfortable shave each time I would recommend this product</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t found any others that have the button to clear the hair from the blade. This is a handy addition as some of the others get too clogged and have to be thrown away.</li>
    <li> AWESOME Razor,&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this razor for about 5 yr,Hated to see Schick discontinued it,Can&#x27;t beat it for the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank God for Amazon</li>
    <li> Great razors for the price and they hold their edge well. I shave every other day and Iam still using the same one since i received them three weeks ago. i would definitely buy them again.</li>
    <li> Smooth shave that lasts several uses. No nicks or razor burns. I&#x27;m spoiled by this brand. It looks cheap but the blades are amazing. If you rinse them with alcohol after each use and dry them, the blades will last even longer.</li>
    <li> Best buy for the money. I have used the expensive 3 and 4 blade razors for a long time until I decided to try these razors. I get at least 6 good close shaves per razor, sometimes more. I even shave the back of my neck without a scratch. I will be purchasing more for sure.</li>
    <li> Super smooth shaves and its so cheap too.  Used it for sensitive areas and so much better than other razors</li>
    <li> This is a very good quality.&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I have been using these disposable razors for years. They do the job at a low price. They last a long time with many multiple shaves from each razor.</li>
    <li> If you are an occasional shaver with light hair, I would recommend these. These don&#x27;t work for me, my hair is too thick. Razorburn a plenty and diffucult to clean because the blades are much too close together.</li>
    <li> Much cheaper than the store sell it for.  I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> Affordable disposable razor that still gives a good shave and isn&#x27;t harsh to the skin.  Brought this for my boyfriend, he loves it and I don&#x27;t care if he loses them all the time.  I even steal them for my legs when I need to take a trip want to bring disposable razors with me.  Has a tiny aloe stripe that keeps razor burns at a minimum.</li>
    <li> Have been using these for years. Find a good price and stock up. Razors have a release button to empty hairs from blade. Comes in very handy.</li>
    <li> Love these.. without doubt the best disposable shavers..  the cleanout button on the back makes all the difference&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do the whole head and face every day in the shower.. and we are talking caveman beard..  they cut clean, close and fast..  last about 10 to 14 shaves</li>
    <li> Very flimsy feel and does not shave as well as I think it should.  Have to go over the same area repeatedly to get a close shave.  Thought it might be good as a travel / disposable razor, but I&#x27;ve had better shaves from generic inexpensive razors.</li>
    <li> if you are fine with about three shaves per razor then go for it.  Not good shave compared to other makes for same price range.</li>
    <li> After repeatedly trying to find throwaways that seriously do the job, this Schick product is really top-notch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking a chance, I got 6 packages, 72 in all, for a fair price. I chuckle every time I hear those snooty ads for high-end razors and shave creams.</li>
    <li> these do not shave so good</li>
    <li> Dear god in heaven help whoever buys these razors, i am not sure if i got a bad bag, if i have super soft sensitive skin or what, i DO know these razors made me bleed randomly throughout my shave. i am 34 years old and i have never cut myself shaving not even when i started at age 17 it&#x27;s a pretty simple process and yet these little razors felt so rough and crazy, jesus i felt like i could have got a better shave if i let chewbacca  naw the hair off my face....it was dreadful</li>
    <li> As listed. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> What a razor should be. simple and unharmful. Gives a close shave and you feel like you are more safe with 2 blades .The blade clean button at the top is good too. Looks like i dont have to waste hundreds of dollars on gillete when the replacement blades are more the whole razor.</li>
    <li> Disposable razor technology was pretty much perfected in the 1970s, although judging by the pictures people didn&#x27;t seem to know that at the time.  These here are inexpensive and will get the job done as good as any others out there.  They will shave anything and everything just fine, and every adult has some area that needs to be groomed. It&#x27;s what separates us from the animals.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on more expensive, fancier razors.  Just use these because they all do the same thing.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Arrived on time</li>
    <li> I would not buy again.  Hair gets clogged in the blades really fast.  Can&#x27;t unclog fully.</li>
    <li> Some of these new razors have so many blades, it hurts just looking at them.  You just stand there wondering, why so many??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried one of the multi blade razors and got crazy razor burns.  Then I got a beautiful Edwin Jagger single blade safety razor.  That worked great, almost no burns, but I got sick of changing the blades.  So I tried this 2 blade slim razor.  Works awesome and no burns.  And economical.  Awesome for travel.  No brainer.</li>
    <li> not really good for a heavy shadow of facial hair.</li>
    <li> Broke out after using. These also required me to have to go over an area several times while shaving.</li>
    <li> No frills razor that does not disappoint.  For the price you can not beat the performance and travels well, small and compact.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a chick and it&#x27;s ok on my legs only! Tears up my boyfriends face and my other girlie areas!</li>
    <li> Good price&lt;br /&gt;Easy use for legs/underarms&lt;br /&gt;No nicking</li>
    <li> These were ok but not as good as good news brand</li>
    <li> Been using these razor blades for years, like paying less for them now.</li>
    <li> My husband is a mountain man and has to shave up to two times a day. He cannot use non disposable razors because the heads break at the pivot point. He uses these with a sensitive shave gel and they work great.</li>
