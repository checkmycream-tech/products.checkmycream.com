<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Useless...not really the Tweezerman brand that was advertised...returned it...</li>
    <li> Item exactly as described, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> It is good but limited in what i can do.  Well made and better quality Stainless Steel than the cheaper ones out there.</li>
    <li> Works Great and Is very hasslefree</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok.  Not great, not terrible.</li>
    <li> Very sturdy and easily takes care of white and blackheads. Just wish I would have bought one sooner</li>
    <li> I have not tried the larger side yet but the smaller sde definitely works super well for blackheads! Definitely recommended!</li>
    <li> Can easily leave marks on your face with this, but it does get out the deep blackheads.</li>
    <li> I got a close look at my chin recently and noticed a lot of tiny whiteheads (yuck!), so I ordered this product. In just a few minutes I was able to get rid of them all with this amazing tool. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because blackheads on the sides of the nose can be hard to get to with this. Despite this, I cannot recommend this product enough. It was so easy to use and it didn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
    <li> Well I have bought this twice now, which would suggest that I like it. I think I&#x27;m more addicted to it than anything else b/c in a magnifying mirror it does appear to clean out a lot of gunk. I actually broke the first one. The looped ends are not indestructible and will weaken with use and then break off. I used it every night for probably 2 months before it broke. I actually break out worse when I first start using it and form those underground zits that won&#x27;t pop and you have to wait them out. I&#x27;m probably doing more of a disservice to my skin than good in all honesty.</li>
    <li> The thinner end is way too thick to effectively remove blackheads.It definitely looks way thinner in the picture than it actually is.  It&#x27;s also very slippery. I threw mine away and had to purchase a different one.</li>
    <li> Horrible. Doesn&#x27;t work at all. Don&#x27;t bother. Go get urself a facial at a spa</li>
    <li> This product is so amazingly gross!  Now of course you&#x27;ll need to open up your pores for the bigger pimples and black heads.  Washing your face with warm water or just after getting out of the shower is best!  Just a little light pressure and all that gunk comes out!  I am very pleased with this purchase!</li>
    <li> this product is soo great. we all know that these balckheads and whiteheads are tough to get out from the skin and squeezing them out is really deadly when it comes to scaring. but i must admit it is painful to remove but faster than anything else i ever used. it gets the grim out from deep within with a few seconds of pressure!!! love it!!! but i must remind you. no pain no gain.</li>
    <li> This thing removes blackheads and pops pimples with ease... so much faster than doing it with my hands and it doesn&#x27;t hurt. My skin has actually gotten clearer since using it</li>
    <li> Better than trying to pinch and squeeze a zit.  This gets it from all around and extradites the pustules.  watch youtube videos for real proof, too.</li>
    <li> BUYER BEWARE - Bait and switch! The product description says Tweezerman, but I received another inferior brand. The item put in a package that reads Velfa (the tool is too big for the package and sticks out over the package)  Whatever brand I received is not as good quality as Tweezerman. I am totally disappointed and seller deserves a negative star rating!</li>
    <li> this is not a tweezerman</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband because it drives me nuts how many black heads he gets. He complains that it hurts and it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> This tool worked great on my forehead. You just really have to know how to take out the blackhead. Practice makes perfect. Took out a star because it would be a lot better if the handle was longer.</li>
    <li> Was not a tweezerman product. A much cheaper brand was delivered. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> i liked it, kinda small though</li>
    <li> This is an essential purse item.  I personally don&#x27;t use the file cause I&#x27;m too spoiled to my glass file.  But the cuticle scissors are perfect and work great, and the pusher is of great quality.</li>
    <li> A very good quality tool.  Nice weight.</li>
    <li> Love this product. This is our second one as the first slipped out of its case. My daughter is crazy for this handy little tool. It shouldn&#x27;t mark the skin, if you use it properly. Can&#x27;t beat the price, too. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I had one of these before that was a lot more sturdy and not so cheaply made! it does not seem strong enough... but from somewhere else.</li>
    <li> Works super well to remove gunk from your skin - both black heads and white heads. The design makes it so that it doesn&#x27;t break your skin as easily as those thin loopy ones do, which means you don&#x27;t end up with a bunch of scabs and the pimple still under your skin. A must have for me!</li>
    <li> Like magic that digs up all the gross stuff on your skin. So happy to have.</li>
    <li> I did not buy this from Amazon- but I did get it at Target. My husband and I LOVE this tool. It&#x27;s umber effective. And we use it almost every day.</li>
    <li> The item was not Tweezerman brand as described in the listing. Additionally, the tool fell apart after taking it out of the package. Amazon has fully refunded my money.</li>
    <li> We all know that you are really not suppose to sit and pick at your skin as it can just cause more irritation. Not everyone wants to walk around with zits though. If you pick at your skin like I do, I HIGHLY recommend getting a tool like this.     This tool has two different ends which come in handy at different times. Its sturdy metal can be cleaned and disinfected. The best thing though is that you can get it extract the nasty and walk away without sitting, squeezing and getting your oils all over your face, which only makes your skin worse.    For my beauty routine I clean my face with a normal cleanser or exfoliator with warm/hot water to open up my pores. In my opinion using steam or warm water to open up or loosen pores is an important part. I extract where need be then finish with a toner or moisturizer with Salicylic acid. That simple. I haven&#x27;t used a specific black head extractor yet but I use this tool for both on my skin and it gets the job done.     Over all great tool! Very handy in anyones beauty bag.</li>
    <li> This is NOT a Tweezerman product.  I received it in the mail yesterday and it had some foreign brand on it.  The back of the package says to soften your face with flannel, um shouldn&#x27;t it say a wash cloth?  Do not buy because you won&#x27;t get what you think you&#x27;re paying for.</li>
    <li> This skin tool works decently on blackheads and blemishes.  Best results are achieved fresh out of a hot shower.  It doesn&#x27;t work perfect in all situations, but if used correctly, can help you from doing damage to your face.</li>
    <li> It saved me alot of heartache from whitheads and blackheads my nose feel clean and smooth like there is no pores anymore , but be very careful so you don&#x27;t heart yourself and leave a mark I always do it after a shower so it helps with opening your pores andbe less painful ,I hope I didn&#x27;t disgust&lt;br /&gt;you.</li>
    <li> Good pimple and blackhead extraction tool.  I own several extraction tools and this one works extremely well for my needs.  I recommend this tool for easy removal of pimples.</li>
    <li> As someone who has suffered for a long time with nasty blackheads on my nose, I really highly recommend this item. Definitely use isopropyl alcohol to keep it clean after every use. You&#x27;ll want to use it right after you get out of a hot shower and there will be a little pain, but the blackheads will come out in droves. Forget squeezing with fingernails, get this thing ASAP.</li>
    <li> Nobody likes dealing with breakouts - they can really ruin your day. This tool is great for taking care of those problem spots without bruising your skin. It works well on blackheads as well as whiteheads, but is less effective on bigger blemishes. It&#x27;s not exactly pain free, but it&#x27;s far less painful than other methods I&#x27;ve seen. Just don&#x27;t forget to cleanse your face before and after using it, and disinfect the tool after use to ensure that you aren&#x27;t putting any additional nasty bacteria on your skin.</li>
    <li> It is great at removing blackheads with less pain than squeezing. Even better, there is usually less occurrence of reappearance of pimples once removed, for me at least.</li>
    <li> This tool is good for blackhead removal and it hasn&#x27;t developed any rust like previous comedo extractors. I recommend buying this.</li>
    <li> Used this item once it works but left huge red marks across my chin for three days, the skin actually became dry and flaked off it was weird like a sunburn kind of effect almost? I think this product is good but I should have been more careful using it and it should have come with instructions on use, I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll use it again or just keep it around for the sake of having it.</li>
    <li> This tool is not a good idea if you have moderate to severe acne.  It will leave marks and you&#x27;ll have unsightly dots all over your face/neck/back it took about a year for the marks to go away. It&#x27;s better to treat more severe acne with chemical peels, creams and antibiotics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tool is fine if you have a few blackheads, or if you have just one or two pimples, but don&#x27;t try to use it on more than 6 or so marks or you&#x27;ll be unhappy and in worse shape than if you let them heal naturally.</li>
    <li> It does the job, painfully but properly.  There&#x27;s no better way, unless you want to use chemicals.  I recommend following up with some toilet paper wrapped fingers to finish the job.</li>
    <li> I have other extractors and on this one the blackhead extractor side is curved upwards (maybe they think this is easier?). But I&#x27;ve gotten less black heads out with this and broken a lot of blood vessels. I&#x27;m not going to continue using it out of fear that I will damage my skin (and I&#x27;m an aesthetician!). You&#x27;re better off with a flat one and always be careful when using one of these!</li>
    <li> I like the Tweezerman product line; this was one of three implements I recently purchased.  Each has nice, quality construction, and each has been quite useful to me.  I am quite a fan.</li>
    <li> Maybe my expectations were too high with this; I thought it would really force out all the gunk with just a bit of pressure, but it actually takes quite a bit of pressure and proper alignment with the blackhead.  I almost think the loop should be a little smaller to better encompass the pore.  Also, you&#x27;ll want to make sure you give yourself plenty of time--like overnight--between extracting and going out as your skin will be marked by little indents from the tool.</li>
    <li> its just a peace of metal .USELESSSSS!!DO NOT BUY!  HORRIBLEEE.  YOU CANT EVEN GET RID OF BLACKHEADS,IT JUST DAMAGES YOUR SKINNNN</li>
    <li> This item works really well at removing the stubborn whiteheads on my nose. It pushes out the whitehead without leaving my skin scarred or ripped from popping or picking.</li>
    <li> Works good on blackhead in ears.</li>
    <li> This tool just didn&#x27;t work for me, I&#x27;m afraid, not even after a steamy shower and using it on the blackheads that were clearly ready to be expressed.  All it did was leave a red loop shape on my skin wherever I pressed it, and moving it along my skin didn&#x27;t feel good, more painful than manually expressing my pores.  Due to my \\&quot;If it hurts, stop doing it\\&quot; policy with my sensitive skin, I&#x27;ve stopped using it.  I&#x27;ve read reviews out there from people who have had great success with this tool, but not me.</li>
    <li> I really like this tool.  It is easy to use and it is durable.</li>
    <li> Excellent tool.  If you have a blackhead to remove, this tool will do the trick.</li>
    <li> Kept clean, this skin tool helps target and remove blackheads and whiteheads without spreading bacteria beneath the skin (the way squeezing between your fingers can do). We have used the no-slip tools and the unsurfaced version; no-slip is the way to go and definitely worth the extra few bucks. We didn&#x27;t think there&#x27;d be that much of a difference, but it is much easier to maneuver and control the tool when it is ridged for a better grip, which ultimately means more accuracy, faster treatment, less pain and quicker recovery.</li>
    <li> Just what it said, paid a fair price, shipped on time. Perfect transaction.</li>
    <li> The end keeps falling off other than that it works okay.</li>
    <li> Both edges were too thick and was not effective in extracting the blackheads or whiteheads.  My skin was sore and red, but extraction did not work.</li>
    <li> This worked!  I watched a YouTube video of a Dr. using this tool and I followed his procedure and advice.  I first tried in the evening and it did not complete the blackhead removal, but did get some stuff out.  The next morning I tried again and it worked.  It does make the area red for a bit, but is worth it in the long run.  Now my mom wants to use it.</li>
    <li> Looking at this tool you would never guess it would work, but it is great for removing ugly looking blackheads.</li>
    <li> The flat end of this tool is great for removing blackheads. I even find it works well on clogged pores (pre-blackhead).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s important to loosen/open your pores before trying any kind of removal. A shower, steam facial or warm cloth over the face for a few minutes are all that&#x27;s needed. After, get out the magnifying mirror and go to it! Be sure to sterilize the tool before and after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve not had a lot of luck with milia (whiteheads), mine are just too stubborn!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it .. it is too big</li>
    <li> Was expecting Tweezerman, was delivered a brand called Velfa-never heard of it.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This tool makes it so much easier to clear out zits, whiteheads, and blackheads effectively. The product is high quality and is comfortable to handle.</li>
    <li> I love Tweezerman products, but this little tool is not very strong and started bending on the first use.</li>
    <li> Definitely works! I 100% recommend this. The only downside, it does hurt when the pimples are located in sensitive areas but that is normal.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised.  I see a lot of reviews complaining about poor build quality, but I haven&#x27;t had any issues in the year and half I&#x27;ve owned this product.  No breaking or loose parts here!</li>
    <li> Great for getting rid of black and white heads. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The truth is that I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m using this thing well, but it&#x27;s a heck of a lot better than using fingers. When shaving leads to ingrown hairs, I resort to this tool for a solution. It&#x27;s well-made, and the sort of tool that a professional would use... I think.</li>
    <li> I did not have any success with this tool, even after steaming the area. The wire loop just dug into my skin and irritated it, and the flat side is not angled enough to be able to apply good pressure.</li>
    <li> This really works to get black heads and pimples under control. I use this tool after I get out of the shower and it works great !</li>
    <li> Nice as they described</li>
    <li> This tweezerman tool is great for clearing out blackheads and small pimples - blemishes - acne. The hooked end works on most blemishes, while the flat end I use for the blackheads around my nose area. One thing you should remember is that before any extraction you need to steam your face. Using this tool after a shower is the perfect time, or you can always dip a washcloth in warm water and lay it over your face for 2-3 minutes to open up your pores. This will make it much easier to use and less force will be needed. Great tool!</li>
    <li> Definitely recommend if you are looking in purchasing one of these tools. Price is reasonable and works well. Thank you!</li>
    <li> There are what they are but I can not get them to do what I want at time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do help so I guess every little bit helps right&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dray</li>
    <li> Worked great for a day... The second time I used it the blackhead side popped right out!  Even when I squeeze the ends and shove it back in it just pops right back out again!  Aggravating!</li>
    <li> This thing works great on on my forehead and cheekbones, but on fleshier parts of my face (cheeks and temples) it doesn&#x27;t quite do the job.</li>
    <li> Waste of money and time.  You&#x27;re better off squeezing out your blackheads.</li>
    <li> Very good instrument for popping pimples and getting rid of white heads. This is the type of instruments used by skin doctors.  An instrument like this does a much better job of popping a pimple cleanly without pinching or squeezing with your fingers.</li>
    <li> It really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great tool.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been curious to see how one of these would work as opposed to my fingers. I admit it, I&#x27;m a picker. Thankfully the scarring that has occurred from my poor habit has been very minimal somehow, but it&#x27;d be nice to have something that I could use to remove blackheads and built up oil without having to squeeze them out (seriously I&#x27;ve tried just leaving them. It doesn&#x27;t work for me. It just doesn&#x27;t). Apparently these tools do more harm than good according to some posts from some skin care professionals in these reviews but, wanted to try it regardless. My overall statement is that this tool is alright and would probably work better for those with larger pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tool itself is very nice actually. It&#x27;s exactly as pictured; high polished stainless steel handle with two loops. One loop is small and is made of rounded wire which extends from the center handle and bends at an angle. This loop is for white-heads and zits so the tool claims.The other loop is more flat and larger which is used for removing blackheads. Now, I&#x27;ve used both loops for both purposes so there&#x27;s no hard and fast rules about this thing. Use whichever one works. I give the quality of the tool a five out of five; it&#x27;s shiny and well made. This thing is quite sturdy and will take quite a bit of application pressure. The usefulness is where it loses stars for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It could just be my pores. I feel they&#x27;re tighter than others seem to have based on other reviews. When I use this tool it only seems to remove a portion of blackheads. I try it on my nose, forehead, and cheeks but blackheads just seem to remain in there. I obviously don&#x27;t want to press too hard. For most blackheads or built-up oil I will try the tool, but then if I use my fingers it comes right out with minimal pressure. I doubt the tool &amp;#34;loosened&amp;#34; it so to speak. In a statement it seems the tool at least does something but not nearly enough to make regular use worth the effort or the potential damage; which is ironic given the first paragraph in my review. If you want to see if the tool works for you go for it; it&#x27;s only ten bucks or so, but it might not work the miracles some have claimed. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different so generally anyone&#x27;s experience with the tool will probably vary as well.s ironic given the first paragraph in my review.

    <li> Being a Neurosurgeon is serious business. Right tool for right job. Obama cutbacks hurt patient care. I bring my own tools.</li>
    <li> Item arrived quickly and have not used it but looks professional and of good quality</li>
    <li> I wish the smaller loop were a little bit smaller to get some of the little guys, but it works pretty well other than that.</li>
    <li> I wish I discovered this when I was younger.  Makes it really easy to pop your pimples.  You don&#x27;t have to worry about making a mess of your face.  Black heads no more.  Easy to take care of the ones between the nose.</li>
    <li> Everything Tweezerman is excellent.  Occasionally I&#x27;ll skimp and buy another brand, and eventually I have to replace it.  So far I&#x27;ve never replaced a Tweezerman product.</li>
    <li> Works good.  Thanks A++</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and this doesn&#x27;t work that well as well, oil is slick.  I usually have to turn it to the side and glide it down my nose to remove white heads.  Not to mention I have deep pores...</li>
    <li> Not sure if I am using it right yet, but well built and cheap so I will keep giving it a try.</li>
    <li> This works exactly as it should and maybe even too well. I have to make sure I do not get overzealous in the mirror and search for things that are not there. The thin end is good and sturdy. The flat end is perfect for removing those oil deposits on your nose. I clean with this with rubbing alcohol after every use with no problems.</li>
    <li> Did just fine although you have to push harder than I thought, but if you push it works as advertised</li>
    <li> I had to replace a lost tool, so I decided to go with a brand name like tweezerman this time. It actually wasn&#x27;t as good as the less expensive one that I lost though. Too thin and the curve doesn&#x27;t help.</li>
    <li> Not as described. Very disappointed and somehow I could not get my money back on this one. Do not purchase.</li>
    <li> This would probably work better for large blocked pores; however, for small ones on the nose, it didn&#x27;t work that well even after a hot shower to open up pores. Leaves marks on my skin, so I didn&#x27;t want to press any harder, etc. I want to try the one that has a perfect circle hole on it next.</li>
    <li> Best invention ever!!</li>
    <li> This tool does not work as far as I can see.  It does not seem to do anything when I use it as directed.</li>
    <li> This tool is better than using your fingers in order to avoid turning a black head into an infected pustule.  However, how you use it is very important.  The tool must be kept clean, the manufacturer recommends rubbing alcohol I believe.  Usually with the end with the smaller loop, I apply light pressure on top of the black head for a few seconds and stop if nothing is coming out.  You can try again later.  The tool may leave a temporary red impression on your face, but it will disappear as long you used it for a few seconds.  This tool is not intended for pustules (but you can try Zeno Pro Acne Clearing Device for pustules at early stages).  I have found this tool to work fairly well for black heads that are not too small and are closer to the skin&#x27;s surface (not for milia).  For day-to-day skin care, the best practice is to exfoliate, exfoliate, exfoliate, so that black heads cannot form in the first place.  In addition, monthly facials have proven effective to prevent acne.  If you are going to pick your face (but you shouldn&#x27;t), get this tool!</li>
    <li> it really works, but the technique is very important.</li>
    <li> Works great! Cleans out black heads and white heads. No pain. super easy! i used this on my daughter too and she loved the results!</li>
    <li> Best thing ever! I rarely break out but when I do, I&#x27;m ready. I simply use the smaller side and gently press it on my pimple. The gunk comes out quickly, I wipe with an astringent and clean the tool with alcohol. It is awesome. Really makes the pimple go away much quicker and gives me relief. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I had to look at a couple of clips on Youtube to figure out how to use the &amp;#34;Tweezerman No-Slip Skin Care Tool&amp;#34;. Now (when I got the hang of it) I shower, use the tool, clean my face and put on Beta Hydroxy Acid and/or Benzoyl Peroxide. I have normal, but sensitive, skin that break out every now and then. Before I started with &amp;#34;Tweezerman No-Slip Skin Care Tool&amp;#34; I had &amp;#34;blackheads&amp;#34; on my nose and cheeks together with 1-2 &amp;#34;whiteheads&amp;#34; and after using the tool for a couple of weeks they are ALL gone. So, &amp;#34;Tweezerman No-Slip Skin Care Tool&amp;#34; works! BUT, it is miracle work made by &amp;#34;Tweezerman No-Slip Skin Care Tool&amp;#34; AND Beta Hydroxy Acid and/or Benzoyl Peroxide. :)</li>
    <li> Having dated a couple of people who would pick at white/black heads on me, I&#x27;d grown a bit tired of having fingers and fingernails pressed into me to help clear them up when needed. This changed that though. Better than using your fingers, and makes getting at black heads much easier! The only feeling when using this item is a light pressure inside the ring when it is pressed against the skin, and the occasional pop of a zit/pimple/etc. Most of the time there isn&#x27;t much of a popping feeling, but rather whatever is trapped under the skin will just sort of... spiral out of your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much easier, cleaner, easier to use, and I can&#x27;t recommend this sort of thing enough if you need to pick at your body.</li>
    <li> This is amazing for clearing acne all over the body (works great on the face, but great on the entire boday!).. I wish I would have had this back in high school for my acne!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure it is functional in it&#x27;s ways and I&#x27;m sure i have a technique problem.  Don&#x27;t let that discourage you, Im just pretty sure I dont know what I&#x27;m doing, Ill give an update in the future.</li>
    <li> Great gadget when you need it !</li>
    <li> I have had blackehead on my forhead for years, and it looked like I always had dirt on my face.  I tried so many things to remove them, and nothing worked.  I eventually gave this device a try.  And Wow, on my first try a major reduction.  It was like scooping ice cream.  The blackheads were popping out.  It may take several treatments, but on my first one It was a major change on the first day.  I do recomend doing it on a weekend, bc your skin can get sore and red, but that goes away fast and the results were worth it.</li>
    <li> Nice product very well made and the price is good as well. So, the process of cleaning your self with this product is painful so be ready to have tears dripping down your face.</li>
    <li> Do not use your nails, use this. Safer, cleaner, way more hygienic. It&#x27;s stainless steel (pretty sure), so it should last a while.</li>
    <li> I had one of the poppers that has full holes in it, not long loops like this one. Well I lost my other one and decided to try this. This tool doesn&#x27;t have enough surface area which makes any pressure applied hurt much more. With the tools with holes and large surface areas, you can apply a lot of pressure for those deep ones without any pain. I&#x27;m sure this varies with skin types and pain tolerances, but if you think you may be susceptible, I would suggest one of the ones with circular holes.</li>
    <li> After a year of use, the smallest loop started slipping out.  For a while, I was able to push it back in, but at some point it just gave out (as did the big one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t complain too much about that as for $11, it lasted a year and a half.</li>
    <li> I bought these on a lark thinking they would be helpful.  After a number of tries, cleaning attempts for them and my face I can say they cause more issues than they fix.  They are great at getting things out of ones pores but... every use brings along with it deep seated acne, the type that is impossible to pop, and that causes those painful, swollen lingering infections that take awhile to clear up.  Overall, I&#x27;d not recommend in the least.</li>
    <li> Thank you, I like this little tool.</li>
    <li> Made well. No blackheads. No complaints.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read a bunch of reviews instructing how to use this, and maybe my nose is extra bulbous or something, but I don&#x27;t think this is any more effective at removing blackheads than when I use two fingernails. It does allow me to cover more surface area, but I can always still extract more whiteheads afterwards with fingernails. I do like using it though, it feels way more sanitary.</li>
    <li> As a skin care professional this has worked great for me at work so I bought one for myself. I know a lot of people on here say it doesn&#x27;t work but remember tools like these are best used by pros that have been trained in such tools.  Look up how to really use these tools and also remember that if a blackhead doesn&#x27;t come out the first try then it&#x27;s not ready to come out yet.  It has never failed me yet. I really love this thing and not only are my clients happy but my husband and I are now also happy with our own skin.</li>
    <li> Its strong, durable, easy to clean.  Works far better than your fingers and leaves your skin cleaner and intact, heals overnight.</li>
    <li> Although it will hurt your face if you push too hard. Some pimples just don&#x27;t want to come out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus usage: tonsil stone extractor...although i recommend you buy a separate tool, or use the opposite end...or clean very very thoroughly.</li>
    <li> This actually does not work at all for me. Beware that even just moderate pressure will give you a red mark that takes a long time to fade.</li>
    <li> Use it on your nose and wherever you want it.  Just squeeze away with out any pain ior worries yeahoo</li>
    <li> Works well for me I like it! It definitely helps get black heads out and it leaves less of a mark from white heads</li>
    <li> works well in combination with clay masking and salicylic acid treatments.  Helps clear deep poors from blockage.  Good product, buy it.</li>
    <li> I had a really stubborn whitehead that was driving me bananas! I tried everything and made it bleed and scab and it still wouldn&#x27;t go away. Ordered this and in one swoop it was extracted! Clogged pore no more! Now I have to wait for the scarring to go away from all my picking but from now on I&#x27;m only using this! It does not scar your skin and it&#x27;s so inexpensive! I wish I had it years ago!</li>
    <li> Great product, timely shipping!</li>
    <li> My little guy would get big clogging boogers, I tried tweezers, toothpicks but they are all too pointy and not safe. This thing works great to pull out those deep ones. The round edged makes it a bit safer for the little one when they twitch.</li>
    <li> Ive read how to use ir but cant seem to get it to work for me</li>
    <li> I use this to clean out pores on and around my nose that gets blocked by oil and dead skin. It makes the job so easy. Makes my skin feel smooth and clean after. Great tool for at home facials.</li>
    <li> So I did not believe that this thing would work. I was wrong. The first time I laid this puppy down on my deceivingly smooth skin, my flesh erupted like a puss volcano with little to no pressure. I use it a few times a week to not only milk my noticeable inflammations, I drag it across the clear parts of my face like a snow plow, knocking all kinds of grime out of my pores.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled friends! This product looks scary to use especially near your delicate face. But I assure you, you will come out of the bathroom glowing after using it. Just have some patience and a little bit of tolerance for minor pain. I use this tool after a nice steamy shower. While my face is still plump and pink I sit down with a magnifying mirror and remove all my blackheads. I do not regret this purchase one bit. I was tired of using strips on my face when 1. strips are not good for your skin and 2. they did not always work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friend who is a huge tomboy used this (after I cleaned it) and she fell in love. She was very hesitant because it does appear to be some sort of scary needle, but with a bit of coaxing she tried it and though she said there was a bit of pain she loved the results. She bought herself a pink one (the pink makes the tool look less like a needle)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great tool!!! I may even show my best guy friend this :) He is always open to new ideas&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be sure to use it AFTER a shower or steam session. I recommend having a towel next by to wipe all the gunk you get on the tool onto the towel while working magic. I never use the longer side and the short side works perfectly for my blackheads and whiteheads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, be sure to add a good amount of pressure as you will not remove anything with a light hand. You will have a bit of reddening afterwards so if you plan on using this tool before a special occasion, use it 2 days before the occasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acne OWNED.</li>
    <li> the loops came off after a while, i keep buying one after another, and i have to say, im tire of keep buying new ones.</li>
    <li> Great tool. Tweezerman quality. Great price and the company is excellent! I&#x27;ll buy this again and from this store. Yay!</li>
    <li> I bought it even after reading not the best reviews I was desperate. The small end works great on black heads and those greasy pores that just have stuff in them but isn&#x27;t hard like black heads. I shower first and then use my magnifying mirror and well its the grossest cool thing ever to just get all that junk out of your skin. White heads are a little different still shower and use your mirror but use the big flat side but first use the thinnest needle you can find poke the center of the white head and then put the flat side over and well yuck. You have to open the pore up first and give all that stuff a exit point. My skin looks so much better now because my big problem was the scabbing the acne would leave with this I dont have that issue any more. I promise I dont work for the company I just really love this thing way better then using your fingers and adding more bacteria to your pores.</li>
    <li> It works just the way it&#x27;s suppose to. Before buying this, I used my fingers and nails. In my opinion it doesn&#x27;t get as much blackheads and whiteheads out as much as I do it manually with my fingers and nails. But it does get the little stubborn ones out that my fingers can&#x27;t. I would still recommend this to others. It&#x27;s lightweight and easy to use.</li>
    <li> It came opened and it looked used.  I was in the middle of moving and didn&#x27;t return it to Amazon.  I never really tried it out because it looked gross, lol.</li>
    <li> THIS TOOL WORKS BETTER THAN I EXPECTED.  IT REALLY WORKS!</li>
    <li> Doesnt remove blackheads at all, it doesnt work for me.</li>
    <li> I had a cheap drugstore version, this is so much better! Perfect tool to extract blackheads without damaging skin. I use it all the time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it several times, already, and it does what I need it to do, especially, the whiteheads.  These are very difficult to get rid of but using the Tweezerman Skin Care Tool I&#x27;m able to to get rid of them in no time.</li>
    <li> Well I got this for some really nasty large pores. &amp;#62;.&amp;#60;,&lt;br /&gt;It seems to work ok it get&#x27;s the stuff out of them and I guess they look a little smaller.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like to use it all the time b/c it hurts a lot to me at least but I&#x27;m using it near the nostrils so that could be why it hurts so much. ^_^&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;I still gave it five stars b/c it douse get the gunk out.&lt;br /&gt;I like to do a steam/essential oil treatment before using this item.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s be honest, I am pore-obsessed and would give a high review to any good extraction product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Admittedly, I&#x27;m \\&quot;that girl\\&quot; who puts Biore strips all over her face in a mask pattern once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, I found this tool and hence I will not have to go bankrupt by way of pore strips anymore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With just a little bit of pressure, the smaller end extracts pore contents like a pro. I&#x27;ve noticed that it works best if I use it after a long shower (or even better yet, a long shower taken right after a cardio workout). Using a scooping motion with the end of the tool helps. The larger end also works ok on pustles, but I&#x27;ve only used it a couple times. This tool is more useful for whiteheads/blackheads because the average person has many more of those than actual pimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have even used this tool on my unsuspecting husband. If I spot a blackhead on his nose, I ask him to \\&quot;wait right here\\&quot; while I run to the bathroom and get the tool. I then proceed to quickly extract the \\&quot;plug\\&quot; from his poor little nose. I show it to him, and he pretends he doesn&#x27;t see anything even though a dark dot of sebum is clearly visible on the loop. And repeat. I know he secretly loves it too.</li>
    <li> I constantly get what a call strawberry nose, but the multiple blackheads in the enlarged pores bear a startling close resemblance to the seeds in a strawberry.  Nevertheless this tool works great, maybe a bit painful at times but certainly more effective than the pore strips or anything else at removing those blackheads.  Best to use directly out of the shower or after you steam your face to open up the pores.  It also moves a lot smoother over the skin.  I may not be able to do much about the enlarged pores on my nose, but thanks to this, I can at least keep them clean and free of blackheads.</li>
    <li> Very high quality, I would almost compare to medical grade. It&#x27;s such an easier and less invasive way to get rid of any acne or issues you may need to deal with. Very quick as well, so less pain.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay...maybe I just don&#x27;t know how to use this tool or it doesn&#x27;t work for me...</li>
    <li> Good but it comes with NO instructions and it&#x27;s actually pretty hard to find videos on it. The product works but there is surprising pain in using it... And I wish there had been instructions instead of me learning by trial and error.</li>
    <li> This is a welcome tool to eliminate blemishes.</li>
    <li> Strangely my new favorite pastime! Works great and easy to use. No more pinching my face!</li>
    <li> Holy cow.  It makes blackheads and puss squeeze out like magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all seriousness.. it does the job. Got a small zit on your forhead.... place the small end over... apply pressure and watch it pop out onto your mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got that challenging blackhead.  This device turns it into the playdough fun factory and squeezes it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stainless steel and can seem to handle the toughest zits and pimples.  Get yours today!</li>
    <li> Like some poeple have mentioned, the tool is a bit too large for some smaller spots, but otherwise it works pretty well, plus i dont have to get my grimey fingers near my face.</li>
    <li> I had never seen anything like this before for doing extractions.  I was just using my nails and didnt like that.  This tool is so much gentler than your nails</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a replacement for an older Tweezerman version that I lost. My old one was about 10 years old. For some reason the tips are different on the new version, the small end is slightly thicker and angled differently. I prefer the old version to the new.</li>
    <li> Works well. High quality. Love it!</li>
    <li> Excellent - Item delivered on time, was as described, great customer service</li>
    <li> The best time to use this product is right after a hot shower because your pores will be open. Similarly, you can also use a washcloth and run it under some hot water, then place it on your nose until it gets pink or red (increased blood flow due to the heat).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember, please do not rub too hard on your nose because you can damage the capillaries in the nose which may cause slight discoloration.</li>
    <li> Its easy to use and gets the pimples right out!  Much cleaner and better for your skin then using your hands.  Definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> does what it is supposed to</li>
    <li> Great tool. It works to push out all my whiteheads.</li>
    <li> Works on mostly easy ones. But there have been a few tough ones conquered.</li>
    <li> however, if you prep your skin by holding a moist warm towel to the skin, it does work with minimal damage and risk for infection.  It works best for my skin for removing/draining mature pimples/whiteheads, when the gunk has already risen to the surface.  Sorry if TMI.  But I find that I can get rid of the root of the pimple better with the help of this tool.  Ick.  But I give it 4 stars.  The tweezerman is the best of all these types of torture devices.</li>
    <li> This is very effective in removing blackheads.  The textured handle prevents slipping.  The end does a surprising job of extraction and it can be sterilized.</li>
    <li> It works but not as great as I thought.</li>
    <li> This broke after a month of light use... One end of it came out of the center casing! I was bummed because it&#x27;s made by Tweezerman, and normally their products are awesome.</li>
    <li> I am a noob to blackheads so I pressed really hard and messed up my blood vessels. This tool is very well made and strong, gently press and you will get all the junk out easily. Great buy!</li>
    <li> works but may leave scares on your face. I&#x27;d recommend using this very sparingly</li>
    <li> Gets out all of those hard to get blackheads with ease. Works especially well after you&#x27;ve taken a shower, as your pores open up and make it much easier to clean your face.</li>
    <li> Blasts out blackheads</li>
    <li> This is a great tool that everyone should own.  Never suffer from blotchy pinched skin again!  I&#x27;ve used this on my body in areas that have broken out (chest, back, neck), and it gets all the gunk out and speeds up the healing process since I&#x27;m not picking constantly picking at anything.  Also good for stubborn blackheads around the nose area.</li>
    <li> I wish I had this product years ago...so many painful attempts at unsuccessfully trying to get rid of pimples I could have avoided! I haven&#x27;t used it for blackheads but it works well for pimples with a whitehead.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Wish the small was the large and there was are super small instead.</li>
    <li> Pair this with a magnified mirror and you will lose a hour a day. Don&#x27;t overdo it or you will end up with a peeling and sore nose. I was shocked at everything that came out of my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of my life I have struggled to keep the pores on my nose clean. Nothing worked. I am so happy to say, that at 47, I finally have a nice looking nose! My pores have been able to shrink and are barely noticeable now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my skin care tool for 9 years and it still works amazingly.  I&#x27;m surprised to find some people say that it doesn&#x27;t work... I used to think that too until I realized how stubborn my whiteheads are.  You have to give yourself a pep talk and endure the pain while pressing the tool down.  Not to sound gross, but I find that I can avoid the nasty puss-filled whiteheads if I catch it early.. Just grab my tool, press really hard, and pop out the stubborn thing that is sitting in my pore (which causes the white blood cells to attack, hence the forming of the white puss we all know too well!). It&#x27;s fantastic, it&#x27;s durable, it&#x27;s definitely a must-have.  And the marks it leaves look really bad at first but then a few minutes later, I&#x27;m back in the mirror, and they&#x27;re gone! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with mild breakouts.</li>
    <li> great tool. this made it so that my pimples came out and it didn&#x27;t leave me with much of a scar.</li>
    <li> An exceptionally well-made practical item.</li>
    <li> Great little tool that does the job. Easy to use and durable.</li>
    <li> Durable and works well.</li>
    <li> I heard about this from a reddit comment and decided to try it out. It works great for what it does. It helps take care of whiteheads and blackheads in a more sanitary and effective way than using your hands. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s me, but I can&#x27;t figure out how to use it. Any ideas? It wasn&#x27;t too expensive maybe one day I&#x27;ll get it down.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000WHYATS Tweezerman No-Slip Skin Care Tool]]    Great product! I actually owned one myself and bought the teenagers one. They just love it and it really keeps the bacteria from your fingers off your face when used.</li>
    <li> This item gave my fingers so much relief. It was able to get deep down to the root of the bumps or whatever I was trying to get out.. A lip painful but it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Have used this product 5 times and it works much better than pinching the BHs. Like that it is make of stainless steel.</li>
    <li> But sadly when using this product I notice that even trying to apply even minor pressure bends both metal looped tips.  without pressure trying to extract the zit becomes pointless.</li>
    <li> unless you have gigantic blackheads and whiteheads this will not work.  Loops are huge.  Very disappointed.  Was recommended to me for milia.  Horrible and does not work.</li>
    <li> A good alternative to using your hands to pop zits.</li>
    <li> I bought a cheap one at Walmart a long time ago and thought this would be nearly identical. The loops are too large to be effective. Defeats the purpose of the tool.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because my nose is covered in blackheads. Most of the time the only thing that it does is make an indent in my skin. It does not remove any blackheads, and is frankly painful to use. Biore pore strips work every time and aren&#x27;t nearly as painful.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s terrible, but I can&#x27;t help but pop pimples on my face. Yes it&#x27;s gross but it&#x27;s gross to see in the mirror too! I saw a friend use one of these and recommended it to me.  It&#x27;s great! You press it in to your face where the pimple is and it pops it. If needed you can press in, and slowly slide away from the area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whenever I pop pimples with this now my face isn&#x27;t bruised, pimples go away faster, and I have less pimples in general. I don&#x27;t know why the last part is true, maybe it keeps everything clean?</li>
    <li> Works great for black heads and pimples that are read to pop, a bit painfull but hopefully worth it in the long run.</li>
    <li> I could not get this to work as described.  I really wanted an alternative to picking, but all it did was leave an imprint on my skin.</li>
    <li> The quality of the product is excellent as always with Tweezerman but this design just simply doesn&#x27;t work for me. I have found it useful in removing splinters when used together with Tweezerman tweezers.</li>
    <li> I watched video tutorials and everything, I couldn&#x27;t get this thing to work at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and just use a needle.</li>
    <li> I like this product but I can&#x27;t get it to work correctly! I think I need some stream or something to open my pores...</li>
    <li> It works really well. I was hesitant to use products like this but it really got the job done. I am satisfied.</li>
    <li> At least not for very small blemishes.  I&#x27;ll hang onto it though - perhaps I can use it for hobby work.</li>
    <li> Makes deep depressions and swollen areas if not used as directed.  Make sure face and hands are clean first and don&#x27;t apply too much pressure.</li>
    <li> Too blunt.  Dod not work as I thought.</li>
    <li> Broke after a few days of using it PROPERLY. Only held together by bad quality glue, the loop fell out when I was using it. Then I pulled the other one out like it was nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I use it to burn and melt loose strings, that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s funny colored in the pictures.</li>
    <li> My skin got irritated after a few times using this product I have sensitive skin so it didn&#x27;t work for me it just made things worse</li>
    <li> Great grip, doesn&#x27;t work like I expected.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t really care for this. tore the skin around where it was at.</li>
    <li> Great tool for self removing white and blackheads. Best to try and remove blackheads fresh out of a hot shower. We clean with alcohol after each use.</li>
    <li> It really works great, though be careful not to push too hard.</li>
    <li> pretty good, gets the gunk out but its still impossible for me to take out my blackheads honestly even if i wet it with warm water</li>
    <li> This tool works well. I guess i don&#x27;t have very oily skin because there isn&#x27;t a ton of gunk coming out of my pores as the other reviewers have said, but it does work extremely well on the occasional whitehead. It is well built, no movement on loops on either side, and seems like it will last awhile. Shipping was super quick.</li>
    <li> great and speedy transaction!</li>
    <li> Good, sturdy product. It&#x27;s a little on the small side. Definitely built for a woman in mind. You will not be disappointed in craftsmanship.</li>
    <li> Solidly made, strong looped ends, recommend this product.  Using the tool gently on the face would be my best advice.  Not sure this tool is meant for every blemish.</li>
    <li> In an ideal world, you would never have need of this tool.  However, it meets a need, and is an easy to clean, sturdy, and precise method of blackhead extraction.  A must have addition to a skin care toolkit, and this tool, well cared for, will last for years without bending or rusting.  A high quality tool, and this version offers more precision than cheaper versions.</li>
    <li> This is a very effective tool for cleaning your pores. Price is reasonable too.  Much better results than the other style tool I used to use.</li>
    <li> Does not really work. I would not buy it again</li>
    <li> I may have been too rough with it, but I hadn&#x27;t used this thing for a whole month before the metal loop in the end popped loose. I pushed it back in, but whatever adhesive or soldering was there before is completely toast, and the thing had become impossible to use. I was probably doing it wrong: pushing down hard, and dragging it short distances in a scooping motion across my skin. I&#x27;m sure it was the dragging motion pulled it loose, but I was having so much fun I couldn&#x27;t quit. It worked great until it broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was my first try buying a pore tool, and I think I&#x27;ll go back to old-fashioned hot water to clean my face in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disappointing, since I love picking at stuff and seeing the goop come out of a clogged pore.</li>
    <li> works great and built very well.</li>
    <li> this may be a good tool still, but just took it out the box and its a generic brand. Misleading as SKU and label claim the item to be tweezerman brand.</li>
    <li> I brought another blackhead remover years ago and it did absolutely nothing. Was highly skeptical Tweezerman&#x27;s blackhead remover would actually work but since it had such high reviews figured it had to do something. I can&#x27;t live without it now. Gets out all the gunk in your pores and decreases healing time of a popped zit.</li>
    <li> When I opened the Amazon shipping envelope, it had a mylar bag with a label on it (probably similar to Avery 5160) that said &amp;#34;Tweezerman&amp;#34; right on it, and had a barcode.  I felt hopeful.&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the mylar bag, I was disappointed to see that it did not contain a Tweezerman brand product, but Velfa, instead.&lt;br /&gt;I tried it, but found that it doesn&#x27;t work as well as expected (almost at all).  I even took a steam bath for 20 minutes, 97 degrees, and tried this on moist and dry skin, and it didn&#x27;t get much out.&lt;br /&gt;I requested a return from Amazon, who merely refunded the money.</li>
    <li> I really liked the product and it works well. It is the best product I have ever used</li>
    <li> this is kinda hard to use but seems to work for my son.</li>
    <li> Bends and breaks way too easily.</li>
    <li> This is the best skin care tool I have ever purchased.  It&#x27;s great for extracting pimples effectively and without damaging the surrounding skin.  Wish I bought this 10 years ago!</li>
    <li> Kind of gross at first when you realize how much gunk is in your pores/nose.  I bought this to clean out my blackheads and I have to say, this thing works really well.  I recommend doing this at least once per week and after a steamy shower.  (Steam makes it easier to clean your pores out.)  I also recommend exfoliating after cleaning out pores.</li>
    <li> At first, I was kind of frustrated with this tool.  It didn&#x27;t seem to work so well, but then I kind of learned how to work it and now I&#x27;ve bought 2 more so I&#x27;ll never be out if I lose one.  These things aren&#x27;t so great for blackheads but any whiteheads will be gone like that with it.  I had a giant zit before a wedding and this helped me get rid of it fast and get all the bacteria and stuff out so that it didn&#x27;t keep coming back like they sometimes do.  Great buy!</li>
    <li> After reading a lot of negative reviews and some positive, I decided to give this tool a try. I read the directions and watched a you tube video with a dr using it. I have used it several times and have not had one issue. It works great. If you hold it one way and it doesn&#x27;t work then move it in a different direction. I wash my face in warm water first and then use it. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> One of the ends broke after a few personal uses.</li>
    <li> I have to confess I got this product awhile ago and do not use it much at all anymore... But I found that when I did use it, it did the job excellently : ) it works really well, was a good price, and seems really well made.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Excellent quality.</li>
    <li> My main feedback would be that instructions are lacking.  I bought a tool so I would not damage my skin, so I was disappointed there was not more than a couple sentences about how to use it.  This only stated which side to use.  I know a visual could be gross, but would be helpful.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described! Quick shipping! Thank You!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m addicted to picking at my skin (I know, it&#x27;s bad), and we all know that using your sharp nails is a recipe for infection. This extractor is a wonderful alternative. As long as you keep it sanitized, those frustrating pimples will be dealt with 1-2-3.</li>
    <li> I like the product it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> Instead of receiving a skin care tool by Tweezerman, I received a product called &amp;#34;comedo cleaner&amp;#34; by a company called Velfa. I was expecting to receive a product by a brand I trust and I am very disappointed. The Velfa product itself does not do much, and it&#x27; s a little too rough to use on any blemish as I&#x27;ve experienced. Wishing I had received what I had thought I had ordered.</li>
    <li> This tool doesn&#x27;t work. I would not recommend it. The edges are too thick to do anything on the skin. It went straight into the trash bin. I am starting to think all of the reviews are paid for - not real customers.</li>
    <li> False advertisement.  This is not a Tweezerman product!</li>
    <li> I ordered a Tweezerman but that is not what I received. Sad that they false advertise Luke this</li>
    <li> It works well and removed the whiteheads, much more difficult for the nose and hurts sometimes. It&#x27;s needed though for those with oily skin. Just make sure your face it wet or steamed for a while to open up your pores more. Also helpful in removing pimples without scarring if you use it properly.</li>
    <li> I watched a youtube video about how to use one of these, and I tried it last night. I definitely didn&#x27;t get ALL of the gunk out of my pores, but definitely quite a bit of it, and if this youtube video I watched is accurate (and I think it is), it takes a few treatments before your pores are completely clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is what I did. I kind of gave myself a facial :)&lt;br /&gt;1. Cleanse with a gentle cleanser&lt;br /&gt;2. Exfoliate, I have one of those Oil of Olay wanna-be Clarisonic things (well the Rite Aid version of it, which I LOVE by the way)&lt;br /&gt;3. Steam face- I do this by turning on my electric kettle and standing over it with a towel. Did this for about 5 minutes, then for another minute here and there as my face started to cool down while using the Tweezerman skin care thing.&lt;br /&gt;4. Use the Tweezerman thing! I found the larger size worked better, and you have to push down a fair amount so yes it does hurt a bit. Also, scrape it over your skin SLOWLY. I think its the SLOW pressure around the pores and blackheads that really gets them out.&lt;br /&gt;5. Clay mask (and tea bags over my eyes &#x27;cause it smells good and makes it super relaxing :)&lt;br /&gt;6. Rinse it all off, tone (I make my own honey/ACV toner), and moisturize :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Voila! My skin is glowing today. I&#x27;m happy with this product. After a few treatments I think I will see a huge improvement in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS I might try switching the order next time, and doing the tweezerman thing after the clay mask, since clay is meant to pull stuff to the surface of your skin, so I&#x27;d wash, exfoliate, steam, mask, steam again, tweezerman thing, tone, moisturize.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t receive the product I paid for. I received a tool by Velfa and the loops are too thick and ineffective. Exceedingly deceptive practice to trade out a recognized brand with a very cheap and poor imitation</li>
    <li> I should have listened to the other reviewers. This is not a tweezerman product. I paid a premium for tweezerman with it&#x27;s stainless steel and life long warranty, and instead got a vastly inferior nonstainless product from &amp;#34;Velfa&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> The product that I received was not a Tweezerman product. I purposely ordered this because I love my other Tweezerman tools however, what I received in the mail was an inferior product. As other reviews and pictures show, the tool did not even look similar and was packaged in a container in which the item did not fit. I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had several pairs of Tweezerman tweezers and love their quality, so I felt confident ordering this item. It has the Tweezerman name stamped on the side of it, and it&#x27;s stainless steel so it&#x27;s easy to disinfect with alcohol. I was a little surprised at how thick the wire loops are, and how big the holes in the middle of the loops are. I&#x27;ve used a bobby pin for years, to press out blackheads, and I expected that size loop and hole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works ok, and unless I really push too hard it doesn&#x27;t damage my skin. It&#x27;s not going to be my favorite tool but it&#x27;s not bad. 3.5 stars.</li>
    <li> Handy item.nice to have. ..</li>
    <li> Very durable. I&#x27;ve used all kinds of pressure with this thing and have yet to feel any kind of give.  Great look and feel.  One of those items you will most likely never have to buy another one of because of how well it&#x27;s made.  Unless you lose it.</li>
    <li> These are great for helping to get rid of those pesky white heads around your nose and the blackheads on it.  I like that it can be kept clean very easily.</li>
    <li> Got it for my daughter.&lt;br /&gt;It blew her mind.&lt;br /&gt;I was grossed out when she showed me what came out of her pores. ( GAG ).&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a note:&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT bear down hard on your skin with this tool or any skin application.&lt;br /&gt;You will wind up pushing gunk back down into your pores, not to mention that if you press down too hard on the top of your nose, you will have a red nose for a day or so.  Honk Honk  ha ha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the price &amp; packed with care.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of this product but took a chance because I was tired of my hands leaving my face looking worse. I don&#x27;t recommend it for popping zits but it is marvelous at removing blackheads and over time just leaving pores clearer so zits don&#x27;t form in the first place. I&#x27;d been using cleansers and pore strips etc for years and never could seem to get my skin really clear. After using this tool when I got out of the shower I now see why. It gets all the stuff out of your face that you thought you had washed off.  It really gets everything out of your pores and leaves your skin really smooth and does make your pores look smaller over time (I&#x27;ve had it about 2 weeks now). I use it every day on my nose and every other day on the rest of my face, focusing mostly on my T zone and chin. I haven&#x27;t had any new breakout, just waiting for my scars to heal and fade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say it is tremendously important to sterilize the tool before and after use with alcohol; the one time I didn&#x27;t, my skin was really inflamed afterwards. I just dip a cotton ball in isopropyl alcohol and wipe both ends. However I find I use the smaller end a lot more than the bigger end (just seems to work better). It does leave an indentation in your skin after use but it fades within ten minutes. Just remember to move on if you press and nothing comes out. It does feel very strange on certain parts of your face. I wouldn&#x27;t say it hurts (definitely less painful than squeezing with your fingers) but there is a slight pinching sensation sometimes. However I&#x27;m a convert for life, this tool is my favorite beauty tool.</li>
    <li> I have a Masters degree and I couldn&#x27;t get this to work. Granted, my degree isn&#x27;t in blackhead extraction; but it doesn&#x27;t roll or move the blackhead or white head. It leaves a hard spatula-looking groove in your skin next to the blemish. So, I ask you; how is that better?</li>
    <li> Finally an easy way of dealing with this horrible acne problem. They are awesome for those constantly getting pimples, zits, and black heads.</li>
    <li> broke after a few months</li>
    <li> It dose what i had expected it to do. I really like that it is very stiff so when i use it on my nose it dose not bend at all.</li>
    <li> I got this for my son to help him clean his pores. Seems to help him. Shipped quickly and the price was good.</li>
    <li> It is easier than using my fingers and probably cleaner too. I would recommend if you want to get rid of black heads with a fancy tool but other household items will do the job to.</li>
    <li> Bought this about a year ago&lt;br /&gt;Great material that&#x27;s heavy and steady&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean and comes in really handy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: have only been using the bigger hoop&#x27;s side</li>
    <li> This things works great. Got it for the hard to reach yucky stuff. It works easy and cleans up nice. Great for ears.</li>
    <li> WAS FLIMSY AND NOT A GOOD PRODUCT WAS NOT MUCH IN COST SO I AM GLAD .DERMATOLOGIST IS BEST I THINK TO GO TO GET BLACKHEADS OUT.</li>
    <li> Technically, it works, kind of. You have to heat your skin with the heat of 1,000 suns first, then cram this thing into your face as hard as you can. And it won&#x27;t get the really deep stuff. You are left with red dents all over your face, and it hurts a little. Maybe I have weird skin, but I was expecting something that was a little easier to use, with less pain and red marks.</li>
    <li> Good product. My boyfriend has had one for forever and I&#x27;d always borrow his, so I just decided to up and get my own. This tool is really handy for popping blemishes and blackheads in a sanitary way--no fingernails or fingers involved. It works best (in fact, I&#x27;d only suggest doing this at this time) after a hot shower. The steam will open up your pores and the pimples--blackheads especially--come out way easier. You&#x27;ll be amazed! I&#x27;ve read some reviews here stating that this thing leaves marks on your skin or doesn&#x27;t work--I must stress what I said earlier: only use this after a hot and steamy shower, or after placing a hot towel on your face. Your pores need to be open to use this tool. Otherwise you&#x27;re just pushing on skin that&#x27;s not ready to have pressure on it. I love this product. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Works great! Better than other extraction tools I&#x27;ve used!</li>
    <li> Counterfeit product. Definitely not tweezerman. Probably will function but if you&#x27;re buying a brand for quality reasons, this is not your seller.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t receive the correct product that I purchased.</li>
    <li> Ouch! Extremely painful, didn&#x27;t work and left horrid marks on my face. Would not recommend unless you have HUGE pimples right at the surface of your skin.</li>
    <li> The product has a good manufacturing quality. However It&#x27;s not that useful to clean the pores as it&#x27;s described on the web.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife, whom uncontrollably picks at my black heads. And I regret it, cuz she loves this thing way too much. Overall, its nicely made, feels very solid. It pulls out those blackheads real easy.</li>
    <li> I have gone through two of these things thinking the first one must have been defected. But after a couple weeks of use, the loop comes loose from the body of the tool. They hold it in place with some kind of glue which seems about as strong as your typical elmers brand. I would not recommend this to anyone, as it breaks way to easily,</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t even know these existed until a family member told me about them. WOW this thing is awesome. No more infections when popping zits. It leaves a mark on your face for about 30 seconds but it makes the entire process so much cleaner and easier.</li>
    <li> I have never used one of these before.  I was surprised at how well this worked, and how painless it is.  It shouldn&#x27;t work as well as it does, but it does!  Feels like good, professional quality, and shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> This is a cool little tool, but I have yet to master it, even after trying it following a warm shower. Am going for a spa facial soon and plan to ask the beautician how to better use it. Shipping was very fast though!</li>
    <li> Quality product. Shipping was fast. Takes getting used to, but certainly works.</li>
    <li> Hasseled about writing something, so here it is.......</li>
    <li> the wire is too thick and therefore requires a lot of pressure which is really abrasive to the skin, the stainless steel is impeccable quality, though</li>
    <li> Does not work. Fingers work better.</li>
    <li> This tool works really well for removing blackheads and whiteheads. Very easy to clean and a nice small, portable size. Would recommend this for any acne sufferers. Just be sure to clean the area of skin well before and after use, and always clean and disinfect this tool before and after each use.</li>
    <li> The item that was sold to me was no what was in the photo. I previously bought this same item at ulta and ended up giving it away but wanted another one for myself and found it cheaper here on amazon but this is NOT the tweezer man brand... disappointed in my purchase...</li>
    <li> It worked pretty well in terms of removing the blackheads from my nose. However, it left huge red marks on my face and I wasn&#x27;t even applying much pressure. Prom is tomorrow, so I&#x27;m hoping that these red marks go away (it&#x27;s been about 2 hours now). I&#x27;m kind of freaking out!</li>
    <li> This is a precision tool to help with your skin care.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this for my teen grand-kiddos who are very satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are very good. I use them to extract difficult ingrown hairs. Not the sharpest I&#x27;ve ever had but still pretty effective.</li>
    <li> Okay product for when needed.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work that well...</li>
    <li> Works for some I guess. Definitely doesn&#x27;t help me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it works for you, you must have some gigantic pores with dirt oozing out of them.</li>
    <li> Got this to use on my daughter. She can&#x27;t get it to work very well. I can&#x27;t get it to work very well. Wish it worked better. I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> It is too small in hand compared to Revlon one.  Would not purchase again.  Opening on large end is too big.</li>
    <li> My pores seem to be too small to use this product. I did use it on my boyfriend and it worked amazingly. Just be sure to sanitize it after every use.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome tool, really great at removing all types of clogged pores, pimples, white heads, black heads, etc.</li>
    <li> Works great and is a quality tool.</li>
    <li> Cheaper than in the store and works great. It helps to take a hot shower to open your pores before use.</li>
    <li> Not as advertised.  I received a Velfa tool in lieu of Tweezerman.......a brand I trust.  I don&#x27;t think the star ratings apply as I have yet to use it, but i can not post a review without it so I gave it one star.</li>
    <li> Works well to clear clogged pores, but be careful not to overuse and damage your skin.  I suggest googling proper use and care.  The videos/explanations are a bit icky but it is i  your best interest to see how the tool is used properly.</li>
    <li> It did not perform well for me, especially for the price. I&#x27;ve tried it a number of times and could never get it to do what it was supposed to do. I wish I could return it.</li>
    <li> I freaking love this tool... I youtubed how to use it and its great. You need to know how to use it or you wont get the results you want. Finally no more nails!</li>
    <li> This is a tool is true to theTweezerman name. Built to last and just the right curvature on the end loops.</li>
    <li> Great product but I wish there was a gripper on the middle!</li>
    <li> This is great for those hard to reach zits</li>
    <li> Never knew something like this ever existed and works great.</li>
    <li> this is a great tool to remove black and white heads. its easy to use and its stainless steel i think overall its a great product 10/10</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve generally got very clear skin, so when I get a pimple it bothers me a lot.  I&#x27;ve read some of the reviews that aren&#x27;t so thrilled about the product, and many seem to be the result of pressing far too hard on the affected area.  I&#x27;d certainly recommend patience, as it may take a time or two to completely clean out the affected pore, gentleness, because if you&#x27;re hurting yourself, you need to take it easy, and without a doubt, I&#x27;d recommend using some sort of astringent like Melaleuca oil or something like(but more gentle than)rubbing alcohol.  This strategy seems to work well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
    <li> Helps keep my face clear of blemishes.  Makes it safer to get the ick gone.  Works easily, and does its job.</li>
    <li> It arrived today and I tried it immediately.&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love it, at last I can remove my black/whiteheads without damaging my skin! I have very oily skin and thats why I need this item so much. The item feels heavy and I think it will last long enough.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend using it AFTER shower, otherwise you may end up with bruises.</li>
    <li> I really should have done more research on this thing before I bought it. It doesn&#x27;t even remotely work to remove normal blackheads or pimples like it states. Any pimples that would be large enough for this to be effective would be serious and should be taken care of by a dermatologist instead. I was disappointed that I basically paid $12 for a metal stick that does nothing.</li>
    <li> It works great easy to hold i have no problems getting the blackheads out of my husbands back....great buy for doing something gross</li>
    <li> Since I have normal skin, blackheads on the nose are expected. This goodie pushes them up and away. Whiteheads are also lifted without much redness to the forehead so I&#x27;m content with this purchase. User-friendly for my small hands and a breeze to clean. Most of my tools are from Tweezerman (that are stainless steel) and they&#x27;re worth the investment. They&#x27;ll last for years.</li>
    <li> It is rare to find anything this inexpensive that is made so well.  Usually this kind of stuff is really poorly made, maybe even not fully functional.  This is an exception!!!  This is the style of tool recommend by dermatologists for it&#x27;s purpose and very well made, so this is the one to buy.</li>
    <li> I like the idea of this product, but basically you have to have gigantic whiteheads to have it work since the loops are so big. I was hoping it would be useful for getting pores out, but it really isn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit that I really enjoy the grosser side of skin care. And this tool helps fuel that fire. It works really well on blackheads and clogged pores and seems much gentler on my skin than using my fingers/nails. Sturdy, well made. I&#x27;m in love.</li>
    <li> Ends are too big and not useful. Grip is nice, but that&#x27;s all. In the waste bin.</li>
    <li> Be gentle while cleaning the smaller tip -- if you pull outwards on it while cleaning it off, the piece may come out.  After mine fell out, I have to constantly push it back in.  Worked great before that piece started falling out, now it&#x27;s somewhat of a hassle.</li>
    <li> Works well, just have to push it hard into the skin to get the result. Its an okay tool to use and buy for the price.</li>
    <li> Very helpful little tool.  Only negative is that after some period of use, the smaller loop loosens then comes out.  It could be problematic if it came out and caused a slip and cut one&#x27;s face while in use.  That is the only reason I gave it four stars rather than five.  This is my fourth one of these tools.  Remember to sterilize it before using.</li>
    <li> I wish it came with more directions on how to use it. It doesn&#x27;t seem to work very well on my skin.</li>
    <li> I tried this even after reading  some of the reviews about it not working well. because I love the tweezers and this company usually makes quality items.  I found it works if you press in front of a pore instead of around the pore.  It works fine for me.</li>
    <li> This is very comfortable and I believe of the design it keeps the skin from scarring.  Best one out, so just get it!</li>
    <li> Took a star off because the little loop STILL COMES OUT  - I had hoped they had fixed that issue from the Tweezerman tool (supposedly same model, but it&#x27;s not) that I bought years ago.  And, it is no longer magnetic. I use a long bar magnet (made for knives and tools) and I use it for this, barrettes, tweezers, scissors, nail clippers, etc. and this version won&#x27;t stick. It says solid stainless steel, but clearly it&#x27;s the type of steel that is non-magnetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To those honestly and fairly acknowledging that they don&#x27;t know how it works: you&#x27;re smarter than you think  :)  and your reviews are accurate.&lt;br /&gt;There absolutely is a learning curve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those who are complaining rudely and *ignorantly* that it does not work - that&#x27;s just like most things in life: User Error.  Learn how to prep the skin for comedone extraction. Jeez, I&#x27;m no aesthetician, but I do my research and I use common sense.  Learn how to use the tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, of course anything you press onto your face will leave a mark. HOWEVER, you&#x27;re doing it really wrong is those marks take one year to disappear - in fact, I absolutely don&#x27;t believe you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re not a clean person, you will spread the bacteria and yes, you will break out more. LEARN TO USE THE TOOL CORRECTLY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t blame the tool because YOU couldn&#x27;t be bothered to learn about proper skin care or learn to use the tool</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical about this tool, especially when I saw how small it actually is, but it works great! Great for getting black heads with minimal skin irritation and damage. Works for white heads too. I also use it to get the little pores along side my nose. That is a little painful I&#x27;ll admit, and I&#x27;ve given myself a bloody nose from pressing to hard so maybe its not the best tool for that particular area but it works great everywhere else!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to get a good grip on the handle, and the size ended up being perfect. Its big enough for most zits and blemishes and small enough to be discreet if you happen to want to hide it.</li>
    <li> I love that both sides of this tool are usable, I use the larger end 99% of the time but once in a while I&#x27;ll have a whitehead in an awkward spot and the smaller end really comes in handy.</li>
    <li> Doesnt work as well as fingernails but doesn&#x27;t scar your face either.</li>
    <li> Bruised my skin, didn&#x27;t get the blackheads out. Saw this on a YouTube video and decided to give it a try, my sensitive skin didn&#x27;t respond well to it. Made my blackheads irritated and bruised the skin - not for me I guess.</li>
    <li> Despite the product listing and label on the bag it comes in, THIS IS NOT A TWEEZERMAN PRODUCT. The come do tool I received is made by &amp;#34;Velfa,&amp;#34; whom I&#x27;ve never heard of. One of the reasons I love Tweezerman products is their lifetime honing/sharpening guarantee. One of the things I hate most is sellers trading on a great brand name with a shoddy product.</li>
    <li> I couldnt get the hang of it seemed to do more damage than good.</li>
    <li> This is the type of tool that you don&#x27;t even know about but that you need.  It is a perfect skin care tool and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> its okay.  Nicely made, but pricey for what it is.  I think you are paying for the name.</li>
    <li> This little gizmo lets you pop a pimple with a minimum of trauma to the surrounding skin. I&#x27;ve purchased them for my teenagers and my parents. Much less painful than trying to pinch, squeeze, or poke a pimple with your fingers.</li>
    <li> This product is as advertized and may work very well for some people. For me, I found it to be very damaging to my skin and actually cause more irritation and acne.</li>
    <li> Yes, right after you press on your skin to extract, there will be marks from pressure, but for me, they go away quickly. So much better than the alternative method. This really works when used properly and extracts the gunk and doesn&#x27;t leave gross wounds. I definitely recommend watching some instructional videos to learn how to use it correctly. With proper skin preparation and cleansing, this really does work wonders.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother with this cheap knock-off product. It doesn&#x27;t work. It&#x27;s false advertisement as it is a cheap/version of Tweezerman.</li>
    <li> I like this item a lot. It is much more sanitary for your skin. If you know what you&#x27;re doing then it can be very veryeasy to use as well as handy to keep around! Anyone who gets stubborn blackheads/acne that is too deep to just &#x27;go away&#x27;.</li>
    <li> buy a solid one, this one is like 2 wires slipped through a straw</li>
