      <li>These blades acutally work better that the orginal blades.  </li>
      <li>I really wasn&#x27;t expecting these to be as good as the original heads, but, to my surprise, they were JUST as good.  </li>

      <li>Noise is not excessive and cut is great.</li>
      <li>Perfectd replacement part and easy to install.</li>
      <li>IT NOW SHAVES AS GOOD AS NEW.  </li>
      <li>the price they were fine.</li>
      <li>THEY WORK FINE</li>
      <li>and they worked fine, but not these.  </li>
      <li>Told me the hq2 would work and it fits with a scraping sound in use.</li>
      <li>These are not phillips (made in Holland) genuine replacement parts.</li>
      <li>one head didn&#x27;t fit at all</li>
      <li>,it runs freely, it does not engage .or stop spinning.</li>
      <li>They seem to be a great deal because of low price.</li>
      <li>The replacment heads are Fantastic.</li>
      <li>Like many others, I trashed them and went back to my much superior three-year-old heads.</li>
      <li>They are made in China.&lt;br /&gt;They are about 1/2 the price of original norelco parts &amp; seem to work &amp; fit just fine.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t feel as smooth as the original heads.</li>
      <li>These replacement blades appear to be identical in every way to the blades that came with the original razor.  </li>
      <li>but I question the durability since it looks quite flimsy compared to the original Norelco heads.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They seem quieter than the original.</li>
      <li>No where the quality of an original head.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice that I can still find replacement heads for my old Norelco electric shaver.</li>
      <li>Spend the $10 more and buy real Norelco blades.  </li>
      <li>Came quickly &amp; efficiently.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly and they have been doing the job since.</li>
      <li>I got better shave from my 12 yr old heads !!</li>
      <li>Of the 3 new heads sent one makes lot of noise but works OK.</li>
      <li>Much more economical than buying a new one, or using disposable razor blades.</li>
      <li>Think about it:  how much would it cost to set up a production line to make a cheap knock-off?  </li>
      <li>Heads fit well into my Norelco shaver head, and operate very well.</li>
      <li>The old heads do a better job.</li>
      <li>My 2 year old Norelco blades are better</li>
      <li>I have an older Norelco electric shaver that otherwise works fine</li>
      <li>Blades are sharp &amp; givbe a good shave.</li>
      <li>R. Ballard is right on the money.</li>
      <li>But the price was right.</li>
      <li>THE OLD RAZOR IS GOING STRONG AGAIN.  </li>
      <li>So far, they work fine.</li>

      <li>If it can last more than one or two years, I would satisfy.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Heads are sloppy when installed in the razor resulting in a a poor quality shave. The compatibles are just not as good as the original equipment replacement heads.  That being said, the service from the supplier was first rate and I would buy from them again</li>
    <li> wworks good at a good price. Will be getting all my shaver needs here in the future. great price for these heads.</li>
    <li> ordered required set of 3 heads for my Norelco. one head didn&#x27;t fit at all so I returned it and requested the correct blade head. No response.</li>
    <li> Horrible shave-not up to Norelco stds. I got better shave from my 12 yr old heads !!</li>
    <li> R. Ballard is right on the money. These blades are just as good as the originals the razor came with. I could not feel any difference.</li>
    <li> There is bad press on these replacement blades that is likely planted by Norelco.  These replacement blades appear to be identical in every way to the blades that came with the original razor.  Anyone who has ever visited China is aware that factory managers run assembly lines for the manufacturer, and then they continue the factory production on the same equipment with the same workers to make \\&quot;off product\\&quot; quantities that are purchased by the competition.  Think about it:  how much would it cost to set up a production line to make a cheap knock-off?  Millions!  These are no doubt made on the same production line as Norelco uses.  The only difference is the price.  These are sold at a more competitive price because you aren&#x27;t purchasing manufacturer advertising with them.  I detect absolutely no difference in function of these replacement blades.  Buy them, and congratulate yourself for making a wise purchase.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel as smooth as the original heads.</li>
    <li> Norelco HQ5 Compatible Replacement Heads ...easy to change and works very well.</li>
    <li> Good stuff and delivery was on time.</li>
    <li> The new blades were less sharp than the ones I replaced.  Not real deal.  I guess you get what you pay for...no generics next time!</li>
    <li> Tried generic replacement heads and they were terrible. Worse than my year old Norelco heads. Sent them back and ordered the &#x27;real thing&#x27;.</li>
    <li> Of the 3 new heads sent one makes lot of noise but works OK. This is very annoying. But the price was right.</li>
    <li> Talk about a dull blade. Wanted to save some money on basic item. Should have purchased the name brand and not the generic.Very dull blade, pulls and grabs the hair. Spend the extra money and get the factory blades.</li>
    <li> They did not work in my razor.</li>
    <li> Awesome! What more can I say</li>
    <li> seems to work like a new razor!!</li>
    <li> Came quickly &amp; efficiently. Heads do not appear to be as sharp as Original Heads that came with Razor.</li>
    <li> I really wasn&#x27;t expecting these to be as good as the original heads, but, to my surprise, they were JUST as good.  Will buy these again. Recommended.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was very good buy, but it wound up to a useless blade. It was as dull or duller than my old blade. It was very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Took a flyer on this, price was very good and decent reviews. Arrived quickly and they have been doing the job since. Sharp but not too shape. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I PURCHASED THESE COMPATIBLE REPLACEMENT HEADS AND THEY WERE ABSOLUTELY NO GOOD.  I USED THEM ONCE AND THEY DID NOT CUT BUT DID PULL HAIRS ON MY FACE....I TOSSED THEM OUT AND REPLACED IT WITH A NEW RAZOR...</li>
    <li> Although the word Compatible is in the title, that just means it fits. The blades did not spin as freely as actual Norelco blades and they did not shave me. Fortunately I saved the ones I took out which are 5+ years old and they still shaved me closer than the replacement heads. DO NOT BUY COMPATIBLE REPLACEMENT HEADS. They suck!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price. I never knew that you are supposed to replace the heads annually. Hell, I&#x27;ve had mine for more than 10 years!&lt;br /&gt;I can guarantee you that I&#x27;ll keep these for more than one year, too!&lt;br /&gt;They seem quieter than the original. So far, they work fine. Time will tell</li>
    <li> These blades are great !!!  They are a lot cheaper than Norelco ones and work just as good.  Since you are to replace every year, this is a great deal !!!</li>
    <li> I feel they are not sharp enough to give me a close shave. I have to include a secondary shave system to get closer. Maybe, I need to use a pre-shave lotion to stand-up the beard. Can you recomend a pre-shave lotion? Thank you! Andy B.</li>
    <li> The Norelco replacement heads for 5810 model arrived as promised.  However, the heads only cut short enough to produce a &amp;#34;five o&#x27;clock shadow&amp;#34;.  The spinning heads create a very noisy buzz, not like the smooth sound of properly matched equipment. Finally, the label insert on top of the head fell out before I got the heads on my shaver.</li>
    <li> Let the buyer beware: these \\&quot;generic replacement\\&quot; heads are NOT THE SAME as the Norelco heads. How? Look at your norelco heads closely: due to the \\&quot;lift and cut\\&quot; technology, there is a thin piece of metal in front of each blade. THESE GENERIC BLADES DON&#x27;T HAVE THAT! While the blades may be the same, the overall head is NOT! Thus, the advertising is deceptive: they are NOT \\&quot;generic replacements,\\&quot; but rather, \\&quot;generic compatibles.\\&quot; I shaved with them once, and they don&#x27;t cut as close as even the two-year-old norelco heads. In order to notice this essential difference, you have to open the package. Yet after being opened, you can&#x27;t return the product! I called shaveroutlet to try to get my money back, but they maintained that they couldn&#x27;t do it. Disappointed all around.</li>
    <li> very happy to have found this great value item, an inexpensive alternative to the brand name product. prompt service by seller.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. These generic replacement heads are not worth a penny. I ended up going back to my 4-year old original heads, which are getting pretty dull, because these are so bad. In one of the heads, the cutting blade jammed so that the whole unit spun--completely unusable. The other two heads pulled my hair so badly that I threw them away and replaced my originals. Will now pay the extra costs for Phillips replacement heads.</li>
    <li> First time I used the razor after installing the new heads the center cover came off and scratched my face</li>
    <li> THEY WORK FINE NOW I CAN KEEP A SPARE RAZOR FOR MY MOUNTAIN CABIN IN THE YUKON SO I CAN LOOK FOR  THE BEARS WHEN WE MEET THANKS</li>
    <li> Received product quickly but once installed in the Norelco shaver only one head rotated instead of all three. Apparently, the replacement generic heads do not contact as well with the rotators like the Phillip&#x27;s brand heads do.</li>
    <li> Works as well as Norelco blades and a lot cheaper to.Service was fast will recommend this to anyone Thank you</li>
    <li> Not as good as original</li>
    <li> I have an older Norelco electric shaver that otherwise works fine but the shaving heads were dull, resulting in a poor and uncomfortable shave.  These replacement heads were exact OEM replacements and my shaver is like new again.</li>
    <li> I should have read the other reviews before wasting my money. Similar to one of the other reviews, the blade on one of the blades broke through the screen and caused the entire blade and screen to spin.  That was the first time I used the new blades. I ended up reinstalling the old blades. Nothing but junk. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> They work best if you put these new blades in the original holders that came with the razor. For some reason they make a grinding noise in the new holders and try to spin the whole thing. But in the original holders they work smooth or at least they do for me and I&#x27;ve used these before and just tossed the new holders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Revise: This last set of blades lasted for almost 2 years. I just ordered and received a new set and installed them. They still make a noise with the blade holders that they came in but when I put them in the original holders they&#x27;re as smooth as they were when I purchased the razor new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Revised: The last set I order lasted one year and eleven months just like the last set. I continue putting the new blades in the old holders and they work just fine.</li>
    <li> Worked fine in my razr .It was a good product an&lt;br /&gt; exactly what I ordered.I would recommend anyone to buy these heads for there razor.</li>
    <li> No where the quality of an original head. I would not recommend this product, buy original if it is possible</li>
    <li> These are a good fit and well priced. It is obvious they are not made by Norelco because they are lighter. They still work very well.</li>
    <li> New replacement heads arrived in a timely fashion and are working well.I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product as it is too dull to make a nice clean cut.  Pay a few more dollars and stick with the Brand Name !</li>
    <li> This does not have the same design as the original.  This is just a cutter without the lift blade. I will see how it works</li>
    <li> Had the shaver for years, and put up with dull heads for too long. The set I purchased , started cutting like a new razor...Should have done thisearlier...</li>
    <li> Great item and service...thanks!</li>
    <li> These blades are poor quality.  Spend the $10 more and buy real Norelco blades.  The blades are dull and malfunction.</li>
    <li> Compare with the OEM product, it&#x27;s cheaper. and the basic function same. I only doubt how long it can be used. If it can last more than one or two years, I would satisfy.&lt;br /&gt;The order and shiping are perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Andrew,  San Jose, CA</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t seem any sharper than the old one.</li>
    <li> The bladed performed well after, I used thick mineral oil (without alcohol) to lubricate the blades when it appeared to be needed. When lubricated, they cut better or just  as good as the best of them. However, the thin metal disk on top of each blade starting to fall off. The glue was very poor and bad choice for the application. I used a small drop of hot glue for replacing these disk covers on each header. They shave great without any problems for now.</li>
    <li> My husband was surprised when he opened these at Christmas.  They fit perfectly and now the razor shaves as if it was brand new.</li>
    <li> After a few shaves, began pulling whiskers rather than cutting.&lt;br /&gt;Fit into the shaver correctly.</li>
    <li> I think the product is fine but expected a better shave until I realized replacement of other parts might also be required.</li>
    <li> Worked very well on he electric shaver. cut well. Is not having any problems, with the new replacement blades. Pleased</li>
    <li> We received the replacement heads in a very timely manner but the Norelco HQ5 &amp;#34;compatible&amp;#34; replacement heads were not compatible at all and should not be marketed as such, they do not fit the razor.  We ended up just buying a new razor.</li>
    <li> Norelco HQ5 Compatible Replacement Heads.  The replacement heads are half the cost of the Norelco brand and are half the product.  It takes about twice as long to shave with the replacement heads and they don&#x27;t seem to cut as smooth as norelco blades.  And you&#x27;ll notice that five o&#x27;clock shadow showing up sooner with the replacement head.  Stick with the Norelco replacement blades.</li>
    <li> Great replacement head blades,will get them again. For the price you can not go wrong.They last for about a year.</li>
    <li> A little noisier than the old ones but the cut is good. New life  for an old razor.</li>
    <li> This product would have received 5 stars except on the second and third use the metal disk inserts on the outside or the cutter heads came loose and dropped off (never happened with Norelco Heads).  They were easily fixed but still an annoyance.&lt;br /&gt;For the price they were fine.</li>
    <li> I was not sure since they are not Norelco, but they fit perfectly, and i am getting a great shave from them.</li>
    <li> Took seconds to install them...took tools to open them. Expected more of an improvement over my 3-year old heads I was replacing. Maybe there is something to the phrase &amp;#34; NOT GENUINE NORELCO&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> The qulaity isn&#x27;t great and it didn&#x27;t give me a great shave.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.  Stick with the brand name for your Norelco razor.</li>
    <li> I chose 5 stars because in the description it was detailed specific for brand and model and my husband couldnt find these anywhere else and he has had this for over 10 years!!! They work better than the day he bought it! Thanks!</li>
    <li> They are not a good quality . .</li>
    <li> The heads are slightly off, making skipping sounds with the feeling that the razor is broken. They were probable machined slightly off so that they wouldn&#x27;t be an exact copy. I had to use the new blades with the old covers and it now takes longer to shave. Do not buy!</li>
    <li> honorable person to deal with</li>
    <li> THE OLD RAZOR IS GOING STRONG AGAIN.  IT NOW SHAVES AS GOOD AS NEW.  I WILL BUY ANOTHER REPLACEMENT HEAD AGAIN.</li>
    <li> The shaver heads I received are very poor, ill fitting, heads.   Over the years I have replaced the heads twice and they worked fine, but not these.  They pull almost as many whiskers as they trim   These do not fit properly and seem to be poorly made.   I  am making do with these while I shop for replacements.   I haven&#x27;t had a good shave with them yet.   The old heads that I replaced shaved better, but unfortunately I had disposed of them before I tested these.  Keith Melton</li>
    <li> One of the heads is bad (blade will not spin) and could not be used.</li>
    <li> Was a good buy, they work great!  Seems to me somebody selling the regular heads don&#x27;t want anybody buying these!</li>
    <li> Delivery was very rapid. Heads fit well into my Norelco shaver head, and operate very well. Noise is not excessive and cut is great. No problems. A great buy.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let the negative reviews fool you. They were probably written by the manufacturer. These blades are as good as the originals at half the price! No noticable difference. I&#x27;m stocking up before Phillips shuts them down.</li>
    <li> I did not expect to  receive a poor quality made in China  product ! The one blade broke in 3 days Oh well lesson learned</li>
    <li> Replaced shaving heads,work great and were cheaper that buying at store.Received promptly     Will order replacements from them again as I have 3 norelco shavers.</li>
    <li> Wish I had read all the other reviews before buying.  These heads are not generic (which implies &amp;#34;same as&amp;#34;) - - they are useless.  Like many others, I trashed them and went back to my much superior three-year-old heads.</li>
    <li> Glad to find them however, when using the new rotary blades they seem to pull, pinch, and are not as sharp as original  blades</li>
    <li> Norelco HQ5 replacement heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t fit the razor well &amp; they do not give you a good shave. The old heads do a better job. I don&#x27;t mind paying more for a better product.&lt;br /&gt;My final judgment : Never again shall I buy this item.</li>
    <li> one of the three heads recd.,spins in the shaver headi. ,it runs freely, it does not engage .or stop spinning. i checked the rasor with the old  heads,works okay.</li>
    <li> Just the replacements I was looking for</li>
    <li> My 2 year old Norelco blades are better</li>
    <li> No working to good ?..Like used ONE</li>
    <li> the cutting is not as sharp as  I feel it should be ------ I go over several times  but still am not satisfied</li>
    <li> item was as described, I was pleased with the purchase</li>
    <li> why pay norelco or other on line sharks $70.00 or more for these replacement heads.i;ve bought this product from this company twice at rock bottom prices with no hassle.quick efficent shipping at a reasonable price.thank you two thumbs up!.</li>
    <li> good shaver, fit right w/ three heads on shaver, work good with three heads, clean three heads and no problems</li>
    <li> These blades work OK, but they don&#x27;t appear to be of the same quality as the Norelco brand, I have experienced some dulling just in the 2 weeks I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
    <li> If I could give these blades less than 1 star I would. They are terrible, don&#x27;t fit or work properly, pull as many hairs as they cut (if I let me beard grow for a few days, I have to use my old razor), and they don&#x27;t last very long. It looks like a real saving at the price but they are complete junk, Pay for a Norelco brand replacement rather than these. It saves more money and trouble in the long run.</li>
    <li> Great replacement blades and cheap too. My 30 year old razor is shaving like a new one again.</li>
    <li> These blades are as good as the  OEM blades and much less expensive...  change your blades frequently and you will be a happy shaver !!</li>
    <li> The replacment heads are Fantastic. This has to be the closest shave I have ever had. Everybody should get these.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it out yet but I question the durability since it looks quite flimsy compared to the original Norelco heads.</li>
    <li> This product arrived on time and as promised.  I would recommend this to others and will order this product again.  These blades acutally work better that the orginal blades.  It is an excellent value</li>
    <li> Perfect they fit my hubby&#x27;s old razor we keep around for &amp;#34;just in case&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Great price fast delivery</li>
    <li> Norelco recommends HQ5 replacement heads for my model 5801XL shaver.  The ordered non-Norelco replacement heads are barely compatible with my 5801XL.  While my former Norelco-brand HQ5 replacement heads performed similar to the original equipment heads, these non-Norelco replacement heads vibrated, shook, and were very noisey.  The purchase was not a good value.</li>
    <li> With these new heads, I have been able to take my old electric razor out of the drawer--it shaves just like new!</li>
    <li> They seem small, &amp; don&#x27;t work so well.</li>
    <li> My recent order for replacement heads for my Norelco Razor was well worth the cost. A replacement razor would have been many times more expensive, and it now performs like a new razor. Perfectd replacement part and easy to install. Delivery was excellent as well.</li>
    <li> These are not phillips (made in Holland) genuine replacement parts. They are made in China.&lt;br /&gt;They are about 1/2 the price of original norelco parts &amp; seem to work &amp; fit just fine. Blades are sharp &amp; givbe a good shave. They seem to be a great deal because of low price. The big question that I can not answer is how long (how many shaves)  do they stay sharp for a close &amp; comfortable shave. So far I have only shaved about 10 times &amp; they are still like new. Norelco says to replace your heads every 12 months-I usually do about every 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;If the chinese heads stay sharp for a year ( &amp; I hope they do ) they are a great deal.!!</li>
    <li> These should not be sold by Amazon! The protective caps (where is says &#x27;LIFT AND CUT&#x27; on the picture) in the center of the head fell off on the first use. They were attached with glue. Now I risk scratching my face each time I use the razor. They are Norelco compatible but not made by Norelco. It may be the model is too old to find actual Norelco parts.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice that I can still find replacement heads for my old Norelco electric shaver. Much more economical than buying a new one, or using disposable razor blades.</li>
    <li> These heads do not shave as closely as I hoped compared to my old ones which were several years old. I do not think they will ever shave as close as I want without a lot of effort. I am ok with them as I do not think there is anything better out there.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT AND SERVICE</li>
    <li> Average...received as described</li>
    <li> instead of items comming like in the past and like photo. The heads just came in a bag like they were recovered from old damaged packaging</li>
    <li> These replacement heads seem to me to not cut as close as the old ones they replaced.  I am not all that satisfied.</li>
    <li> did not seem to shave as close as i expected, so i purchase a new norelco  complete razor</li>
    <li> perfect fit ,now my razor and I are friends again .  good buy ,fit as stated.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed at a fair price.</li>
    <li> Installed them on an older Norelco and they work perfectly.  Had the battery replaced a couple of years ago ... and have no reason to buy a new razor!</li>
    <li> Very surprised that these heads were as sharp as they were.  Definitely recommend, and will probably buy again in the future.</li>
    <li> So far, the set of discount priced shaving heads has performed just as well as the way more expensive Norelco factory made ones. Delighted.</li>
    <li> Told me the hq2 would work and it fits with a scraping sound in use. too much bother to return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sw</li>
