      <li>i love it going to order more</li>
      <li>I love liquid eyeliner better then pencil</li>
      <li>i haven&#x27;t tried removing it yet, so let&#x27;s hope that isn&#x27;t too terrorizing! &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>LOVE this eyeliner.</li>
      <li>Very easy to use and easy to control.</li>
      <li>It does not smudge, and it lasts all day but is easily removed with eye makeup</li>
      <li>However, I thought the eyeliner wiped off really easily.</li>
      <li>Works fine for my daughter</li>
      <li>I applies so smoothly, and stays on all day.</li>
      <li>Its worth the price :-)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s rich color, and stays until you take it off.</li>
      <li>The eyeliner came today and it spread very well, making it super easy to apply!</li>
      <li>Not bad for price and got delivered on time</li>
      <li>This is my new favorite, I recommend.</li>
      <li>It was just what I was looking for , it stays on for the whole day and soo easy to use.</li>
      <li>I tested it on my fingertip earlier, and I could easily wipe most of the liquid off with one stroke-</li>
      <li>stays right where you put it.</li>
      <li>OMG I love this eyeliner, i have trouble with pencil eyeliner because it smears but this stuff stains on my top eyelid.</li>
      <li>Truly waterproof black eyeliner with a good felt tip.</li>
      <li>One of my all time favorite eyeliner, especially for the price!!</li>
      <li>When I first got it, I drew a flower on my leg and wore it all day like a tattoo under my pants.</li>
      <li>first, I didn&#x27;t receive it in the mail, so I contacted the seller and they shipped me another one immediately.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Im big on black eye liners and this one works great</li>
      <li>I was very disapointed in this product.</li>
      <li>It glides on my eyes really well.</li>
      <li>The package arrived about a month after I purchased it, but it&#x27;s reasonable being that it&#x27;s from China.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast (considering it was shipped from China)</li>
      <li>I really appreciated that.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I would recommend not wiping your eyes often or letting the liquid dry first before doing any touching near your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Nicely pigmented and long lasting, gym approved.</li>
      <li>wow!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is definitely comparable to some of the higher end eye liners but for a much cheaper price.  </li>
      <li>Would have to wait and see how long it actually lasts, but so far its ok.</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>It was an amazing product at first as it went on bold and thick, but after about a week it wouldn&#x27;t even dispense a dark grey pigment.</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and is very dark  </li>
      <li>so when it came in the mall,  I was surprised to see &amp;#34;pencil&amp;#34;written in the side.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s natural reaction</li>
      <li>Soft felt tip that just glides like butter.</li>
      <li>i have naturally greasy skin, and it seems that when i put on make up</li>
      <li>Would actually purchase a few more, would recommend others to buy.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s not messy and stays on for the entire time.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s lasted me a year now and it&#x27;s AMAZING, perfect for winged eyeliner.</li>
    <li> Works really good for dollar eyeliner! The only couple things that I had a problem with is that....&lt;br /&gt;1) Its not waterproof. I placed water on my face to see if it would stay on and it didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;2) When I was applying it on, sometimes it wouldn&#x27;t pour out enough eyeliner so I would have to reapply it several times before it got to be even all around. But what would you expect, its dollar eyeliner! I would recommend this for people who don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money and don&#x27;t mind reapplying their eyeliner a couple times.&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, it took over a month and a half to finally come to my house!</li>
    <li> i have naturally greasy skin, and it seems that when i put on make up it&#x27;s natural reaction is to freak out and get more oily. this one however, seems to stay on even when i rub it! and of course, when you wear make up, you always get itches where you worry it will smear. this one, nope! stays right where you put it. i haven&#x27;t tried removing it yet, so let&#x27;s hope that isn&#x27;t too terrorizing! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Excellent perfect for the price I honestly think I did great I love liquid eyeliner better then pencil this creates a perfect line wow!!</li>
    <li> I bought a lot of these to give out to ppl and I regret it. It gets a star bc you have to give a star to rate it. You can only use it a couple of times n then it stops working. Boo!</li>
    <li> I had never used liquid eyeliner before and decided to give it a try  It was delivered on time and was packaged well  I tried it out and ..... I LOVE IT!  It goes on smooth and is very dark  It looks great  It hasn&#x27;t dried up or leaked or anything  It&#x27;s an awesome eyeliner for the price!</li>
    <li> It was just what I was looking for , it stays on for the whole day and soo easy to use.</li>
    <li> Best eyeliner ever! I do track, cross country, and outdoor track and it stays on every practice and the only way I can take it off is with makeup remover. Very easy to use and easy to control. A great pen for beginers</li>
    <li> This eyeliner does for me what I wanted it to do, and the price is good. Would have to wait and see how long it actually lasts, but so far its ok. I apply it and it&#x27;s not messy and stays on for the entire time. Would actually purchase a few more, would recommend others to buy.</li>
    <li> OMG I love this eyeliner, i have trouble with pencil eyeliner because it smears but this stuff stains on my top eyelid. I put it on in the morning and it doesn&#x27;t smear or fade until I take it off at night. This is my new favorite, I recommend.</li>
    <li> trick to use like and dislike 1 rate for me but i love the design love and hate it bad</li>
    <li> Excellent  product. It took about 3 weeks to arrive. Product last all day. Yes, I recommend.</li>
    <li> This actually works quite well. When I first got it, I drew a flower on my leg and wore it all day like a tattoo under my pants. It stay on all day and even when I took a shower I had to finally use makeup remover to get this off. It is definitely waterproof. It glides on my eyes really well.</li>
    <li> Was completely dried out by the time I got it. I couldn&#x27;t use it at all.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is actually waterproof. ..</li>
    <li> The eyeliner came today and it spread very well, making it super easy to apply! However, I thought the eyeliner wiped off really easily. I tested it on my fingertip earlier, and I could easily wipe most of the liquid off with one stroke- I would recommend not wiping your eyes often or letting the liquid dry first before doing any touching near your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, a great deal!</li>
    <li> Its worth the price :-)</li>
    <li> Its awesome, it stay on all day it was a good price I told all my friends about it Great product</li>
    <li> I wish I had. I was very impressed with this liner. I applies so smoothly, and stays on all day. I actually fell asleep with my makeup on the other night, and I woke with my makeup still intact. Stays on through workout.</li>
    <li> LOVE this eyeliner. Once you put it on dries up in few seconds. Still using it.</li>
    <li> Took forever to get here and was definitely not worth the wait. Its not waterproof at all and doesn&#x27;t go on dark you have to keep going over the line and when you do it flakes off. Horrible.</li>
    <li> It takes quite a bit for it to come in, but it goes on smooth.&lt;br /&gt;At first, I didn&#x27;t receive it in the mail, so I contacted the seller and they shipped me another one immediately.&lt;br /&gt;I really liked how they catered to the customer in a timely manner- I really appreciated that.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the eyeliner for a couple months now and it hasn&#x27;t run out yet, and let me tell you, I use it every day multiple times a day.&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t waterproof like it says, and it comes off if you rub your eyes, but if you don&#x27;t touch it, it stays on the entire day.</li>
    <li> The package arrived about a month after I purchased it, but it&#x27;s reasonable being that it&#x27;s from China. It was an amazing product at first as it went on bold and thick, but after about a week it wouldn&#x27;t even dispense a dark grey pigment. It dried up completely. I was very disapointed in this product.</li>
    <li> Wow! I&#x27;m amazed at the quality of this item, very dark black color. Shipping was fast (considering it was shipped from China) it was here in about two weeks. I will order again, i&#x27;m more than pleased with my purchase thank you!</li>
    <li> Works fine for my daughter</li>
    <li> Amazing! i love it going to order more</li>
    <li> Very good eyeliner. I expected a liquid so when it came in the mall,  I was surprised to see &amp;#34;pencil&amp;#34;written in the side. I used it nevertheless, and I adore it! The only compliant I have it that it doesn&#x27;t go on well over concealer which I use on my eyes. But it NEVER smarts smudges or wipes off! I would definitely recommend buying it! Cheap price, great quality!</li>
    <li> Soft felt tip that just glides like butter. Nicely pigmented and long lasting, gym approved. IT dosent smudge fade or flake. IT is water proof ans also with water it wont smear or drip away. a good buy and will be buying more.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this eye liner!!!&lt;br /&gt;It is definitely comparable to some of the higher end eye liners but for a much cheaper price.  It does not smudge, and it lasts all day but is easily removed with eye makeup remover.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely continue to use this product and I have and will continue to recommend it to my friends and family!!!</li>
    <li> Amazing! Truly waterproof black eyeliner with a good felt tip.</li>
    <li> Really great! Im big on black eye liners and this one works great ive ordered 3. Not bad for price and got delivered on time</li>
    <li> One of my all time favorite eyeliner, especially for the price!! Always buy 2 for when the other runs out. It&#x27;s rich color, and stays until you take it off.</li>
