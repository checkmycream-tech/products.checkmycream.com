      <li>Awesome top coat!</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
      <li>Great top coat!  </li>
      <li>, I&#x27;m very glad</li>
      <li>Love this nail polish!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok!</li>
      <li>*** is magic.</li>
      <li>I love this top coat...</li>
      <li>I bought this from Walgreens yesterday and I LOVE it.</li>
      <li>and I have noticed my manicure lasts much more than before using this product</li>
      <li>The only top coat I Will ever use, it&#x27;s truly a great product!</li>
      <li>Also the shine is much better.</li>
      <li>Sure it dries quickly, but at what cost?!</li>
      <li>Is not gel like so is easy to apply</li>
      <li>Not as strong as polish&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s well worth the price!</li>
      <li>I love this more than my Seche Vite actually.</li>
      <li>Instead of taking 45-60 minutes for polish to dry, with the Good To Go</li>
      <li>especially when paired with the top coat!</li>
      <li>This topcoat really works!!</li>
      <li>Thanks for the quick deliver too...</li>
      <li>as well as leaves nails glossy, I used it on a light pink shade and this top coat made my nails look like acrylics it protects the color as well</li>
      <li>It gives that professional gloss on my nails along with super quick drying.</li>
      <li>Makes my nails very shiney!</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
      <li>Dries nails really fast!</li>
      <li>I knew exactly what I wanted, and I had it within days.  </li>
      <li>Mani seems to last longer with this top coat.</li>
      <li>Waited about 5 minutes after the last coat of polish to put on the top coat.</li>
      <li>It does begin drying VERY quickly (turn off your ceiling fan for best application) but I like to give it the extra few minutes if possible.  </li>
      <li>An extra coat of Good to Go helps my manicure last days longer.</li>
      <li>Top Coat Rapid Dry</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>It REALLY drys fast.</li>
      <li>My only complaint is with Walgreens lol.</li>
      <li>Unlike most of the other  rapid dry top coats, this one by Essie doesn&#x27;t have a harsh odor to it.</li>
      <li>At Walgreens they charged me nearly $9 for ONE bottle of this</li>
      <li>I can even shower shortly after using it and not mess my nails up!</li>
      <li>It really cuts down the time I would have to spend at the nail salon.</li>
      <li>So tired of having to wait over an hour or five for 2 coats of polish and a top coat to dry before I can resume my regular breathing pattern....let alone life!</li>

    <li> Love this nail polish! It really cuts down the time I would have to spend at the nail salon.</li>

    <li> I love this top coat...</li>
    <li> This s*** is magic. I can even shower shortly after using it and not mess my nails up!</li>
    <li> Instead of taking 45-60 minutes for polish to dry, with the Good To Go Top Coat Rapid Dry it takes about 5-15mins (until you can eat, shower, etc).  It does begin drying VERY quickly (turn off your ceiling fan for best application) but I like to give it the extra few minutes if possible.  Mani seems to last longer with this top coat.</li>
    <li> Awesome top coat! So tired of having to wait over an hour or five for 2 coats of polish and a top coat to dry before I can resume my regular breathing pattern....let alone life! This stuff is amazing! Waited about 5 minutes after the last coat of polish to put on the top coat. Within 2 minutes, they are dry! Buy this stuff now!</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a gift for my wife. From her:&lt;br /&gt;1) It REALLY drys fast. Within a minute or so&lt;br /&gt;2) Not as strong as polish&lt;br /&gt;3) Is not gel like so is easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchasing Con: Wish it came via prime!</li>
    <li> Great top coat!  It&#x27;s definitely makes any nail polish last longer. especially when paired with the top coat! Great buy!</li>
    <li> Excellent product and quality!! Great price!!</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with this top coat. Sure it dries quickly, but at what cost?! My manicure looked awful. It caused the polish to shrink away from the tips and cuticles. My manicure looked a week old after only a few hours. I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again.</li>
