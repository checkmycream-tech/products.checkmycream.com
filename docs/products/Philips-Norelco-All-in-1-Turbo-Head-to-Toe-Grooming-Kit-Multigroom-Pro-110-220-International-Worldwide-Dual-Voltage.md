<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> excellent product!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This product works OK... but is so cheap feeling and low quality it won&#x27;t for long. Parts everywhere and no storage or stand, super cheap plastic parts and low quality look and feel. Returning this for something better. Do not recommend unless you want something for a couple of months then throw away. Hard to imagine how this product makes it to market in this form. Sad.</li>
    <li> This could have been a great kit, but some poor design choices hamper its functionality.&lt;br /&gt;I like it OK, certainly not as much as the paid reviewers did for obvious reasons.&lt;br /&gt;As noted by many others, its feels very cheap, I definitely feel like if I drop it one time its done for.&lt;br /&gt;The plastic storage case is near useless, the accessories don&#x27;t fit securely. And the travel pouch is completely useless since its a soft case and the razor does not come with any kind of a blade gaurd for traveling, and forget about putting the foil shaver attachment in that joke of a travel case unless you don&#x27;t care about ever using it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another general flaw is the flexible hair gaurd, you have to be careful not to press on it at all or its teet will flex and cut a little shorter in spots.&lt;br /&gt;The turbo function pretty much has to be used all the time, I&#x27;m of scandinavian descent and even my hair slows it down. I highly suspect the non turbo speed is so marketing can claim an exaggerated run time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, an inherent flaw to all in shower electric trimmers that this one also suffers from is the inability to stand up wet hair. If you try to use this in the shower for trimming body hair or any hair over an eigth of an inch you will get frustrated very quickly.  I love the idea of using it in the shower to keeo the mess in the sink down, but I&#x27;ve found it just doesn&#x27;t work out as well as I&#x27;de hoped. I found the best way for me is to stand in the shoer with out the water running and trim the hair dry, and then shoer. Still keeps the mess down. I do use it with the water running to trim my hair as its pretty short (no.3) and it works ok, but my hair is very fine and it still takes more passes than I&#x27;de like if used with water.&lt;br /&gt;Great that you can just rinse it out though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately this trimmer CANNOT be used while plugged in which is a major bummer as all my other cordless trimmers can be. I&#x27;m sure its insurance legislation for the random knuckle heads old enough to have a beard but not smart enough to know that no you can&#x27;t plug it in and then shave with it under water in the bathtub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to sum up: its handy for keeping the mess down if you can find a process that works for you. It is more time consuming than using a dedicated clipper and isn&#x27;t very powerful in non turbo mode, so you are essentially paying a performance penalty to keep the stubble out of the sink. Its cheaply made, the parts that look like brushed aluminum are actually plastic, and very light weight plastic at that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My final comment is regarding amazon. I was quite annoyed that I pre-ordered this razor and amazon dropped the price 10 dollars on release day and made it prime eligible. So lucky me, I got to pay a 10 dollar premium to boost amazons pre-release sales figures. Thanks guys, I certainly won&#x27;t be pre-ordering anything from them in the future. Pre-ordering is supposed to come with some sort of benefit, discount, bonuses, early ship, something. I got it the same time as the people that waited for its release, but paid an 10 dollar surcharge for zero benefit, lame.random knuckle heads old enough to have a beard but not smart enough to know that no you can&#x27;t plug it in and then shave with it under water in the bathtub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to sum up: its handy for keeping the mess down if you can find a process that works for you.

    <li> The Philips Norelco QG3380 Multigroom Pro trimmer comes with full-size trimmer blade; hair clipper; hair clipper comb; beard and moustache comb; nose, ear, and eyebrow hair trimmer; and storage pouch. One feature that I overlooked was you can use this groomer in the bath or shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a lot better to shave in the shower -- and easier on your skin too. The combination of warm water and steam reduces the force needed to cut the hair. There is just one thing I don&#x27;t understand is the Turbo Power button. The instruction says pressing the button for a fast results. I feel like that should not need a button and should always be set on turbo. Other then that this is a great product, I am happy to have bought it as my first trimmer. I wanted something cheap but good. In my opinion, to get something better than this will cost you at least the twice.</li>
    <li> This unit might be MIA as I did not like the shave I got with it, not even if it were free would I take one.</li>
    <li> Very nice, tons of different attachments. The adjustable guards work really well. Works better than I expected. I use it for beard and stash grooming and it&#x27;s perfect for it.</li>
    <li> I saw this product reviewed in a magazine and they said it was the best ever. They must have paid big bucks for that review because it is anything but user friendly. Changing heads is about the most cumbersome thing I ever used. Not sure who thought up that design but it should have went through some testing first. The unit does the job just fine but overall I&#x27;m already looking for a suitable replacement. I don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this daily for 8 weeks now and it&#x27;s been great. I&#x27;ve only used it as a facial hair trimmer but I&#x27;m very happy with it. There are lots of attachments for grooming different parts of your body. It is somewhat difficult to learn how to use because there are so many attachments and it&#x27;s not obvious what they are supposed to be used for, so you will need to read the manual to figure it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver charges quickly, and is easy to hold. It doesn&#x27;t seem particularly durable and the attachments are made of cheap plastic, but as long as it lasts it works great. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that there is no storage case included, and the \\&quot;deluxe travel pouch\\&quot; is kind of a joke. It&#x27;s just a small flimsy bag and you&#x27;re supposed to throw everything in there - some compartments would have been helpful. The razor and attachments come in a case that looks like it should be a storage case for your bathroom counter, but alas it&#x27;s just for display; the attachments don&#x27;t stay put. Philips could easily have put a little extra effort into the packaging and made it useful for storage.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for over a month now.  Works good on all areas of the body and does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best multi use shaver I have had. It charges rapidly and has enough battery to last me through whatever it is I am shaving or trimming. I can use this all over my body with one tool. I used to have the old body groomer from Norelco. I hated it. The battery is horrible and it didn&#x27;t do nearly as many things as this. It is worth every penny. I am a hairy guy and I like most everything to be trimmed and this works perfectly for that. I love all the different attachments and they are labeled as well to help make sure you are not using the wrong one and avoid cutting yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only con it could be a better build quality.  However, I have not had any issues with that.</li>
    <li> Another wimpy Norelco trimmer that I expect will stop working right after the warranty expires...</li>
    <li> I like this multi groom pro since it is very convinient and sturdy design.  when compared to the benefit, the price is not that bad.</li>
    <li> This is nice on the beard. No tearing or pulling but rather a nice clean cut and feels soft. Not like others I have tried. Does well.</li>
    <li> Great personal groomer.</li>
    <li> The package does not bring the base to put the machine or parts of it.</li>
    <li> I like the product with the attachments that enable one to do anything. The travel bag is also very handy. Right after receiving we took a trip and all I needed fit in the bag perfectly. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price, although the package bag could have been a little better. Thumps up to Philips for this device .</li>
    <li> Seems to work really good been using it for around a month and only recharged it once. It has good battery life as I&#x27;ve used it daily. Very easy to use. It has a lot of options, really a lot of stuff. Its a must have. You can clip your hair, trim your beard and mustache, and get rid of the nose hair.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday. I love the fact that it doesnt have to be oiled everyweek. Very smooth cutting and I have had no pulling whatsoever. Not a huge fan of the cost but it is worth it.</li>
    <li> it does the job nicely. but it does feel cheep due to the material used building it</li>
    <li> 8 attachments, very useful for different parts of the body. Charges very quickly. Easy to clean. Excellent product. 5 stars.</li>
    <li> It just losed a star because it doesn&#x27;t work when is energy plugged. Otherwise would be 5 starts even with the soft case that looks like super cheap, and could be better.</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome! Sharp and effective - exactly what I am looking for. The $5 coupon also helps to save some money.</li>
    <li> Great product overall, good battery life, nice quality, easy to use. Works fine with 220v powerline, but needs adapter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only con for me - no stand, the package plastic can be used for the purpose, but it needs huge amount of space - does not fit behind bath mirror or occupies whole drawer in the nightstand. Also the &amp;#34;Deluxe travel pouch&amp;#34; can be hardly named &amp;#34;deluxe&amp;#34; &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Gift for son.  He is happy with it.</li>
    <li> My husband loved it! He loved how it stayed charged, smooth shave, lots of attachments. Seems to do all it promises. This was rated in the top 25 gifts men want. That is how I found it. Glad I did!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned several norelco trimmers in past and this model seems to be underpowered and not very precise. The blades should cut faster and closer.</li>
    <li> Groomer for the average joe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Compact&lt;br /&gt;Versatile (includes everything you need for body/face and possibly hair&lt;br /&gt;Waterproof&lt;br /&gt;Body groom attachment is fantastic&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Noisy&lt;br /&gt;Needs multiple passes with the attachments to take it down to clean skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turbo is a good feature.  Can&#x27;t beat this for the price</li>
    <li> Perfectly what I needed.</li>
    <li> I received this multigroomer to replace my old Philips Norelco which was several years old and still running strong. However, I like this one because of how easy the attachments change out. Plus the trimmer is angled perfectly so you can trim your mustache or hair line easily without fear of messing it up like older models. I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed and there are many detailed reviews on here about this Norelco...</li>
    <li> Given the number of attachments provided, the ease of swapping them out, and the compact size, this is a great multi-use men&#x27;s grooming tool for travel. Everything you could possibly need on a larger hair/beard cutting implement is provided. Absolutely fantastic- feels sturdy and well weighted. Not cheap feeling at all!</li>
    <li> Works great. Let&#x27;s just say from head to toe, it does it all quite well. Just be aware the attachments level locks don&#x27;t hold too well, so if you apply TOO much pressure they may drop a level. Hence 4 star instead of 5. All in all a solid product however.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I finally purchased this product. I used to have a $20 multi groom kit that was terrible. Didn&#x27;t cut well and didn&#x27;t hold a charge. But this Philips product is sheer power. I used this mainly for body hair and to trip up the sides of my hair, and it exceeded at all of this. All of the attachments allowed me to get great precision and I haven&#x27;t been this well groomed and hairless since I was twelve. It holds it&#x27;s charge so well that I can use it multiple times without having to put it back on the charger, and it still has a lot of power. If you want to have a tool that lets you groom your head, face, and body, then this will be a good investment. No more using a manual razor and getting irritation.</li>
    <li> I had a groomer that was exceptionally loud previous to this one, and while it did its job well, it felt very cheaply made, and was not waterproof. While I don&#x27;t shave often in the shower, this is a nice feature this one has the other did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The number of attachments that are included is impressive, including, but not limited to a nose trimmer! The tray to hold all attachments holds them well, HOWEVER it is very cheap and flimsy plastic. In addition to this, it&#x27;s a massive piece of plastic that takes up entirely way too much space. Ditto for the bag that comes with it, but it would do its job if you needed it to. Honestly I doubt I&#x27;ll ever use it, because I rarely take things like this on trips/travel. IMO these two minor issues do NOT warrant me decreasing stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somebody posted that &amp;#34;I have to use the turbo mode the entire time I use it or it doesn&#x27;t work!&amp;#34; I think that person may have been used to a trimmer similar to MY old one (very loud). This is considerably quieter, but does a VERY good job on the normal setting for all body hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that you absolutely cannot use it plugged in - they&#x27;ve actually included a safety feature that prevents it from turning on AT ALL while plugged in. This is obviously a safety feature for the idiots that would try to use it in-shower while still plugged in, but for the normal intelligent American, this is a semi-annoyance and limits its use when the LiON battery dies in a few years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All said, very good to excellent trimmer that didn&#x27;t cost me $100? I&#x27;d buy again!</li>
    <li> i use it for haircutting mostly.but these caps that i adjust length with seem so weak.they seem very easy to be broken.&lt;br /&gt;i want it sturdy</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s face it--you&#x27;re reading grooming device reviews because you have unwanted hair. You need something that is going to do the job, do it well, and not injure you in the process. Keep reading!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a woman, and I have a close enough relationship with my husband that don&#x27;t mind helping him reduce his body hair by a measurable percentage. Leg hair, arm hair, neck hair... you name it. We&#x27;ve tried a few different grooming devices--not because we use them frequently or have excessive body hair to tame--because most of the ones on the market just don&#x27;t cut it. (See what I did there?... \\&quot;cut it\\&quot;? I digress.) Other makes/models cut some of it, and then end up pinching and pulling on the rest of the hairs to the point that it&#x27;s too uncomfortable to proceed. If we wanted an epilator, that&#x27;s what we would&#x27;ve purchased!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the Philips Norelco Multigroom Pro! This lovely, cordless device effectively trims hair to so many lengths even Cousin It would like it. The best part is, it does it without pain, despite the hair location, hair coarseness, or guard size (or lack thereof). Additionally, it has great battery life. We charge it up only every once in a while because it holds the charge and lasts long enough for multiple sessions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And just because I&#x27;m writing this review and felt it would be unfair if I only wrote based on what the trimming-recipient felt, I tried it myself on my arms. Granted I have thin, blonde hair on my arms, so it wasn&#x27;t a major challenge. Regardless, it was able to catch each and every wispy hair from elbow to wrist, even though I couldn&#x27;t see all of them. For that reason, I gave it 5 stars - it \\&quot;sees\\&quot; the hairs better than I can! I&#x27;m happy to report that we disposed of all the other makes/models of grooming devices in the house, and this one proudly sits tucked away in a drawer, only taking up room on the bathroom counter every once in a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get this one--your significant other (and/or shower drain) will thank you!hank you!</li>
    <li> The product is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;It works so smoothly.No need of buying any extra product. A complete body grooming solution for all</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a versatile, whole-body trimmer.  Battery life is good and the buzzer gives me a shave close to blade-smooth.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> The trimmer does a fine job, but the shaving head does not give a close shave at all. I ended up returning it and going back to shaving with a blade. The plastic holder for the different attachments is very poor quality as well.</li>
    <li> I really likes this trimmer. It has everything I need. I was about to get Philips Norelco BG2040 BodyGroom Pro for body groom but I changed my mind after I read some reviews. if you want to use it for your beard, or body hair specially private areas then this is defiantly your choice. The turbo feature is my favorite. The quick charge is awesome. The only downside is the adjustment of hair comb length. I find that a little bit difficult to adjust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than this boy is monster. glade to have it.</li>
    <li> Hands down better than any Wahl I have ever owned.  I do, however, wish that the storage/cradle was better made, more compact and that it could charge while standing up.  But, for the price, the quality is very good and the battery holds an excellent charge.  Note that the silver parts on this unit are metal but all of the rest is plastic.</li>
    <li> Great cordless trimmer! There&#x27;s an attachment for almost every purpose here. I prefer a rotary trimmer for noses and ears, but the linear version included here isn&#x27;t bad. Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> Good power in either mode though I tend to use it more often with Turbo on. Smooth, pinch-free shaving. Great buy.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that I bought as a gift.  You can never go wrong with a Philips Norelco razor..</li>
    <li> My husband said this Norelco trimmer is the best he&#x27;s ever used, and would recommend it to anyone! It arrived a couple of days earlier than expected, too.</li>
    <li> Best shaver I&#x27;ve used for removing body hair.  Looks like a razor was used.</li>
    <li> The Phillips Norelco Multigroom is a decent product and trims nicely in most cases.  The shaving screen attachment is fairly worthless, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue with the shaver is with the POORLY designed adjustment of the cutting distance attachments.  The numbers are hard to read and there isn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;pointer&amp;#34; or arrow to use to keep track of the distance settings.  (Nail Polish fixed that).  Otherwise the product performs prety much as I would expect it to.</li>
    <li> The small foil works OK for shaving but this set would have been complete if it came with a dual rotary blade attachment</li>
    <li> Versatile design, ideal for portable, very good product, I trust Philips, I recommend it to everyone.fast delivery,quick response,nice price,Try it.</li>
    <li> I have had this shaver for about 3 months now and I really like it.  It has been reliable so far and has not had any issues.  The shaving guards are a little flimsy but I dont plan on taking it out on any rough trips so I dont anticipate having any problems with them breaking.  It is easy to clean and it charges fairly quickly and does not run out of battery super fast.  I am usually able to get by with charging it about once every two weeks and use it about every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course it does not get as close of a shave as an actual razor, but its not like I expected it to for $50.  I mainly use it for trimming and maybe use the foil if I need to get rid of some stubble but dont have time to actually shave.  All in all I think this is a great electric shaver for what it costs.</li>
    <li> I wanted a multi- purpose trimmer that ran for at least a couple weeks before a recharge and was quiet. That&#x27;s what I got. If took a few tries to get the attachments on initially.</li>
    <li> It works really well. The adjustable pieces are awesome and gives you a very close cut. It also holds charge for a long time.</li>
    <li> I want Panasonic machine but found the best there are 8 cut very suitable for personal use.&lt;br /&gt;It is best to use a very easy :)&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> Product arrived as advertised.  Worrks great...I have had no problems with it.  I would recommend to anyone looking for a beard trimmer...</li>
    <li> great for sensitive skin. especially for teenagers who break out a lot. also very convenient for all the different areas to shave</li>
    <li> Switching out attachments is easy. The head of the main blade is smaller than I would have liked. Haven&#x27;t tried it other than dry but like the wet option.</li>
    <li> I liked the trimmer and bodyshaver, I don&#x27;t think the appliances for the beard work very well. The quality, looking and battery are very good.</li>
    <li> This razor is great.  The only issue I have with this razor is that the beard attachment isn&#x27;t great if you don&#x27;t have a full and thick beard.  Otherwise, battery life is great so far and the attachments work great.  I would like to see a smaller and more compact stand to hold all the attachments.</li>
    <li> I was sent a QG3386/45 multigroom pro instead, so customer service was more than gracious to refund me $25.00 for the difference in models.  They are basically the same, just one is newer and the QG3380/42 comes with the stand.</li>
    <li> received groomer in a timely fashion and was packaged very well...all parts included as shown...was pleasantly surprised to find that that the groomer was very solid and had more power then anticipated.</li>
    <li> Great little trimmer does everything you could want. Good battery life. lots of attachments.</li>
    <li> I like it as it cuts the hair very fast and smoothly, also it&#x27;s not very heavy at all, and it has many caps</li>
    <li> It was a good product... It felt kinda cheap. The features were really nice. But mine died after 6 months and about a dozen uses.</li>
    <li> The person i gave it to ,as a gift ,is very hairy thru out his body ,and he loves the outcome of the capabilities of the shaver</li>
    <li> I got tired of using those cheep battery powered $20 trimmers. I did a lot of research and bought this as a replacement hoping it would be quicker and better quality with no pulling. This is a top notch groomer. I am not all that, well, hairy, so I use it mainly for eyebrows and some other delicate &#x27;manscaping&#x27; if you know what I mean... no grabbing or pulling. Lots of attachments. Adjustments on attachments are tight and hold well between uses, and they are incremented so you can get the length you need. Battery lasts for a long time, maybe 6 weeks (again, I don&#x27;t use it daily). I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> This is my third groomer - I had two body groomers that broke down. I also had a trimmer-only model, also by Philips-Norelco, which also broke down unfortunately after taking in water. This one combines a body groom and a beard trimmer. So far it&#x27;s worked well. However it&#x27;s only been two months since I bought this, so consider this review tentative.</li>
    <li> This thing comes fully loaded for the price.  Like most trimmers you get an assortment of heads and specialty trimmers.  seems to make short work of any unwanted hair with no pulling or tugging.  The turbo feature makes the head go a little faster not sure what thats about,  maybe for thicker hair than mine.  I couldn&#x27;t even find this model in the store so im pretty happy with my purchase.  Holds a good charge out of the box,  but like most of these things i feel like it will only last a few years, but we will see!</li>
    <li> excelent your atencion!!! i like the form size its very very good excelent product.........thank you very much&lt;br /&gt;i love you</li>
    <li> My boyfriend was getting frustrated with his hair and mustache. This covered all his bases and more. He raved about it :)</li>
    <li> It does all that I expected and the battery lasts more than enough time. I recommend it to everyone .</li>
    <li> Without question, the BEST hair clipper/beard trimmer/&amp;#34;body groomer&amp;#34; tool I&#x27;ve ever had! It performs EXACTLY how it was described and I couldn&#x27;t be any happier. The battery holds its charge for an amazingly long time, too.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and works as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;The plastic combs for hair clipping feel a bit cheap, but they are holding on nicely for now.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift. He likes it. It is practical. Everything is as described. The only thing that I was surprised about is how light this thing is. It is made of plastic even the part I thought is aluminium (on handle of course, not blade).</li>
    <li> This is a great product for the hairy man.  Can cut hairs everywhere.  Nose, ears, mustache, it can do it all and can wash under the faucet.</li>
    <li> Great Shaver.  Works as advertised.  Comes with multiple attachments for all trimming needs.  It&#x27;s made well and the battery holds its charge.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my husband and he really likes it.  He said it&#x27;s easy to use and looks forward to using the attachments.</li>
    <li> Around two years ago, I bought the Philips Norelco QG3280 Multigroom Pro, which was the best body groomer I ever purchased. Well, for some odd reason, water got into the body of the groomer and destroyed the switch. (I took it apart when the unit would not turn off and found water inside along with corrosion) The only one I found on the net that was available was on Amazon for $399.99. Its good, but not that good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I went on line and did some reading. My first purchase was the Remington PG6250 Wet-tech. It pulled and nicked! The unit had almost no angle on the head making it very difficult to get into hard to reach areas. The outside shell was much like the GQ3280, which was non-slip and had a good feel in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No satisfied, I read more and found the QG3380/42. I purchased it right after. -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The outer shell is plastic and takes time to get used to as it is slippery when wet......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head angle is close to the older GQ3280 which made it much simpler to use in odd areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The QG3380 uses the same head (Body trimmer part) as the GQ3280- which uses the anti-hair pull and nick blades.  This is very very important, even when using the right shave jell/cream, you can still be nicked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure as to why they have a Turbo button which does speed up the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does NOT work when the cord is plugged into the unit charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually cut my son’s hair, on his head, around ¾ of in inch off, and it did not pull once. Actually it cut very well to my surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two things I do not like about it are:&lt;br /&gt;1 Does not use a Lithium Ion battery&lt;br /&gt;2 Does not have a charging stand&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:&lt;br /&gt;I’m Greek; I know and have hair! So it is important that the body shaver I get will be right as I use it often. This body groomer works very well with a long batter run-time and strong cutting blades. This is a good unit.</li>
    <li> Hubby doesn&#x27;t look like a mountain man anymore. Good job Norelco! Very messy but that could be the hubby though...</li>
    <li> fantastic, works as promised, all the options I need, and reasonable prices, and Philips quality</li>
    <li> a perfect grooming product .i rated it 4 stars as one of the accessories didn&#x27;t fit the body. overall a good product</li>
    <li> My single son seemed to really like this when he opened it, and used it while he was here for Christmas. He said that it was a good thing for him and worked well. Spoke with him this month and he tells me that he hasn&#x27;t shaved since the new year. Some trend thing. Hope it wasn&#x27;t this.</li>
    <li> Maybe I received a bad unit, but the battery will not hold a charge and will drain itself after a day.  It does not work on the cord so that means I have to leave it plugged in at all times to get any use out of the device.  Most importantly, the attachment for the beard clogs with my heavy beard and the mechanism simply stops working.  If I take the head off of the trimmer, the motor still spins at full speed, so it is a flaw in the design of the attachment that it cannot stand up to a heavy beard.  I regret buying this and will be looking for something a little more durable for my needs. If you have a light beard and never plan on using it in the shower (wet stubble seems to be even worse at clogging the head), this might work for you.</li>
    <li> Long Version:&lt;br /&gt;I bought this to replace my Norelco hair clippers because one of the guards broke and I cannot find a replacement. So, primarily, this was going to be used for cutting the hair on my head; all of the other attachments were a bonus. Unfortunately, adjusting the length of the hair guard is annoying - the increments are very small, and dare I say difficult to read. I &#x27;fade&#x27; my own hair and frequently switch lengths. I was expecting it to be similar to my previous Norelco except they crammed of all of the lengths into one guard. Add to that the reduced width of the clipper and its usefulness sub-par at best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Short Version:&lt;br /&gt;If trimming hair on your head will be its main function, this is not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In retrospect, this actually deserves 3.5 stars compared to other clippers I have encountered recently.</li>
    <li> Easy and conveniente to use. Charges fast, works for an hour. Bought it few months ago, I hope it will work for a long time.</li>
    <li> Trims well but the guides are cheap plastic, as well as parts of the body. Doesn&#x27;t seem to have a lot of power either.</li>
    <li> Loved this thing. Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do ... very versatile.  BUT after about 6-7 months, the attachments will not stay tight on the shaver anymore. The attachment will twist on like normal, but once the shaver is on, it swivels to the left or right. So you will get an uneven shave (if you use the plastic guides).  After it swivels, the shaver gets even louder.  I&#x27;m a sad panda now ... because I have to look for a new shaver or buy this thing again.</li>
    <li> after purchasing 3 shavers....this one finally fit the bill for my husband.  tons of attachments...a nice little bag to store them in...and nice sleek design.  but most importantly it works...no snags or pulling.</li>
    <li> A really handy tool to have.  Easy to use.  Great price.</li>
    <li> Excellent! Battery life lasts for weeks and the attachments allow for every use case. Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> Really good product... The ship was on time!!</li>
    <li> really good trimmer, for the price it&#x27;s a bargain! works well, doesn&#x27;t pull hair and is easy to use. i may buy more for presents.</li>
    <li> This was a wonderful sale, so I got several--for my husband and sons. They all reported it is an excellent shaver.</li>
    <li> Like the product. Does what it says. Bought a grooming set from this company before.I will continue to buy this brand.</li>
    <li> Received different piece</li>
    <li> It is a really trimmer it has a lot of different attachments and works really well price was really good.</li>
    <li> bloody nice cutter. just a top beard trimmer. maybe a bit expensive but it gets the job done. i really do recommend if you got the cash</li>
    <li> The quickest charging, longest lasting, most versatile body groomer I&#x27;ve had. After going through many a groomer that would run out of battery in less than 30 minutes or took eight hours to charge. The blades and shields change easily. The length guide is perfect to ensure consistent results.</li>
    <li> I have used the Norelco G370 and QG3330, and a Remington PG520B plus another model which had the same problems. I like all of them except the Remingtons. The Remingtons had to many short comings compared to the G370. Hair pulling and beard combs not locking at all. Now the g370 is great did everything i needed of it and then some and for around 20$ i cant complain. The QG3330 is alright same design as this model but doesn&#x27;t come with many of the attachments its liek the very very basics. I like how i can rinse the entire unit off that&#x27;s a huge plus compared to the g370. You could wash the heads on the G370 though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  This pro unit is shower proof i used it in the shower and it saves a lot of time and clean up. I would not submerge it though. I did read it was for shower/ bath use but in the manual it says not to submerge. I don&#x27;t understand why there is a conflict between website and manual. But i know its a beard trimmer/hair grooming tool and not a submarine. but i had water pouring all over it for my entire shower and it is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  If i do run into problems i will update my review. I have only used it a couple of times so far and I&#x27;m am pleased with the quality of the product so far. My buttons do not feel cheap or thin to me. I used the body groomer head and it works well i would use the main trimmer head to chop down long hair first. since it is the pro version i thought the deluxe case would be better but it fell some what short. It is alright does what it needs though and holds all the pieces together. I through away the tray i never keep those trays they are just a hassle/ gimmick to me. I don&#x27;t care if the unit lays on its side i  just leave it in the bathroom on the sink. i would recommend this and i have. My friend bought the plus model and my brother also uses one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  If the unit brakes i have no doubts that the warranty service will be easy . I used it before on a different unit all i did was chat with customer service over the internet on their website and they promptly sent me a replacement and all i had to do was put my old one in the box and drop it off to a FedEx drop off box. You get a 2 year warranty and if you register the unit you get extended 6 months. I am very pleased with Philips Norelcos warranty&#x27;s and customer service and I will continue to use and buy their products. As long as their customer service stays good of course things change over time for now i stand by it.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased to receive this item via the Amazon Vine Program because it is something that I really needed, given that I have a beard and mustache.  This clipper is very powerful, which makes it very easy to trim my mustache in particular; a mustache can be tricky to style unless a clipper does not have to \\&quot;work hard\\&quot; to cut through these coarse hairs easy.  This clipper comes with numerous attachments.  While I have not used all of them, it is fair to say that these give the clipper the ability to pretty much satisfy all of one&#x27;s beard and mustache trimming needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a \\&quot;handy\\&quot; little trimmer to hold and operate.  It is basic but ergonomic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue with this trimmer is the built-in rechargeable battery.  In the past after a couple of years these batteries stop holding a charge, rendering the trimmer defunct.  Obviously I just received this unit and cannot comment on this issue here.  Put simply, I tend to prefer a trimmer that accepts AA batteries simply because eliminates this issue.  I am imagining that the built-in battery entails higher voltage than AA batteries would provide which means more power to the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I received this free through the Vine program, I judge it to be a decent value for the money.  RJB.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to keep this review concise. This Philips Norelco Multigroom Pro gets the job done well and covers an impressive number of bases at a very reasonable price.  Eight attachments along with a handy storage bag.  I personally only use three of the attachments, so its probably less storage required than it sounds.  The unit charges quickly and holds its charge very well.  When fully charged, it provides great power to get the trimming done without a lot of time or irritating pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you probably read, you can use this in the shower which is great and convenient.  Also allows you to easily clean the trimmer when you&#x27;re done.  I really like the ability to change the length settings on these attachments.  It gives you the ability to get closer than some other trimmers I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this four stars instead of five only because of the quality of the attachments.  A couple of them are relatively flimsy plastic.  They will definitely break if you drop this, so you&#x27;ll want to be careful. It certainly should be a consideration for a tool you might be using with wet hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, great trimmer, very pleased with it!</li>
    <li> I wanted to upgrade a shaving tool I purchased a while ago and thought I would give the Philips shaver a try.  Philips is known for making high quality shaving products, so I figured this one couldn&#x27;t miss.  I normally don&#x27;t like extremely close shaves due to razor bumps, and this one looked similar to the one I already own.  I was impressed by the 9 attachments, but less so, once I tried to use them.  I felt like they were more of an afterthought, than attachments specifically made for the device.  They didn&#x27;t work particularly well, and didn&#x27;t add to the shaving or grooming experience at all.  Basically, they are not very user friendly and they have a flimsy feel to them.  They also didn&#x27;t fit the shaver particularly well, either.  The overall shave experience was average, at best.  I didn&#x27;t feel like this shaver did anything to set it apart from the competition, and the attachments were a step back, in my opinion.  I found myself finishing up my shave with my old shaver, so that&#x27;s that.  It&#x27;s a decent enough shaver, but there are cheaper, better ones out there.</li>
    <li> I been using similar Norelco products for a long time and I&#x27;d say this one is the most versatile to date.  This system has enough heads and attachments to shave pretty much anything from head to toe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The facial hair trimmer has several attachments and precision settings, which you can adjust easily in parts of inches.  It also includes a nice ear/nose hair attachment.  You can also keep yourself neat between haircuts with attachments for head&#x27;s hair.  Body-hair attachment are(no surprise) work well, as Norelco been making body shavers for years.  It even includes some attachments that I&#x27;ve never seen before, including a mini-foil shaver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While cleaning is fairly easy, this shaver is not designed to be used in the shower.  There is no \\&quot;stand/base\\&quot; for the shaver, as its a simple plug-in charge system, which I&#x27;m OK with.  A very roomy all-you-can-carry black pouch is a nice finishing touch for a very solid shaver.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a similar WAHL trimmer for probably 5 years... and have replaced it 3 times due to the internal battery crapping out.  But each time I go back to the WAHL because aside from the battery, I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When given the chance to review this one, I thought this might be as good as the WAHL but without battery issues two years from now.  I was wrong.  This Norelco has a goofy head that trims less area and does a worse job.  The blade speed is MUCH slower than the WAHL and it took me longer to trim.  Half way thru my second use of this, I disgustingly threw it in the drawer and went back to my WAHL and I haven&#x27;t touched it since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a good multifunction trimmer with Lithium Ion battery, stick with this WAHL http://www.amazon.com/Wahl-Lithium-Ion-All-Trimmer/dp/B001GQ3GEY</li>
    <li> I have to say I&#x27;m very excited by the Phillips Norelco QG3380 primarily because it legitimately covers all different aspects of men&#x27;s grooming (with some caveats - more later) to the point where I am now comfortable getting rid of three different items the QG3380 replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst aspect of this item is the packaging.  While its compact, its a real pain in the ass to open.  When will hassle free packaging be universal??  Moving on I found the functionality of the shaver quite robust.  It can handle body hair trimming on arms and legs no problem, the foil shaver can handle detailed smooth face shaving, the nose hair trimmer works fine and the hair clipping feature cleans up my sides nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver comes with many guards so it takes a bit of time to figure out what works where.  The build quality is pretty decent but honestly I would pay much more for something with higher quality since for me, this is would be my go to grooming tool.  The case is cheap but it does the job of holding all the parts.  The battery life seems to be very strong and since I don&#x27;t use electronics in the shower, I can&#x27;t speak for the water proof abilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some caveats:  My routine is to keep a a nice short 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.  I don&#x27;t shave my face with a razor and so I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with foil shavers.  From what I gather you need those blades super sharp so I can&#x27;t really speak to whether or not this would replace a dedicated face shaver.  The same goes for the hair clippers.  The metal blade is not super wide and the power seems to be enough for light trimming of my own hair but if you are constantly cutting kids hair (or pets), I&#x27;m not sure I would replace a dedicated trimmer for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summation, this unit allows me to get rid of hair clippers, beard trimmer and nose hair trimmers (and their respective pieces) so I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Just received the trimmer yesterday and found it to be an excellent product. My biggest concern was wanting the tray to hold old the accessories neatly on my cabinet, but was unsure if this did in fact come with a tray. Sure the second picture showed one, but was not in the specs, nor in the owners manual online. I was happy to see the tray in the box was in fact the tray to hold everything. But it was larger that my old trimmer&#x27;s tray, and was too deep to fit on my cabinet. So I just threw everything all the accessories in the bag, and I actually like that better. The trimmer and charger are the only things left out. Nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this to replace my last multi trimmer that stopped taking a charge after 5 years, and am very happy I chose this one. The Ear/Nose attachment has a cutting edge along the side so it is very precise cutting exactly where you put it. Sliding it along my skin, in my ear canal, in my nose all around my nostrils worked awesome. No pain, no pulled hairs, no tickle, no tears. My old trimmer had the round end style that had a piece spinning inside it, that was the worst, always pulling hairs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main clipper with the beard attachment works awesome, there are more height settings than the old one used to have. And also the attachment appears to be stronger that the old one since the plastic goes up and around the front, kind of like making a cage. The old attachments just had each comb going straight out to nothing, and of course over the years a couple of comb lines had broken off. I don&#x27;t think these attachments will break that easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cutting with the main trimmer worked awesome. Used the regular mode, cut my coarse hair with ease, and it is so quiet! A lot of other trimmers, and hair clippers bind up with my coarse hair. So this was the important test, and it passed with flying colors. And also there is the Turbo option if I needed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I am very impressed with the trimmer, I expect it to continue working great for many years.t it to continue working great for many years.</li>
    <li> I was exited waiting for this one to be out, since my BG2030 stopped working and aparently Norelco stopped producing it.. (Too bad, the BG2030 looked and felt amazing and it was by far the best one I ever tried).&lt;br /&gt;By the picture, it looks really great and being the top of the line I was imagining something at least good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One word to decreibe it: CHEAP&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attachments look and feel cheap and flimsy.. You have to attach very carefulky because it feels that it will break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;-Although not as good as the BG 2030 , it does the job&lt;br /&gt;-Lot&#x27;s of attachments&lt;br /&gt;-Battery Charges in one hour&lt;br /&gt;- It comes with a 2 or 21/2 years warranty if you register online ( I&#x27;m sure this is the best thing about it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;- NOT skin friendly as advertised... The metal trimmer is very sharp and it will cut sensitive skin... I got 3 blody ones first time I used and with the body comb attached on 3.&lt;br /&gt;-Feels and look really really Cheap ( the metal looking fromt is made of a cheap plastic as well )&lt;br /&gt;-Noisy, like those $15 sets available&lt;br /&gt;-No stand&lt;br /&gt;- The plastic tray is nothing like the picture, it&#x27;s green and as cheap looking as an egg box.. The attachments won&#x27;t stay put&lt;br /&gt;-The nose trimmer head is very hard to attach&lt;br /&gt;- Everything feels flimsy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s pretty much my first impression, I&#x27;ll update as soon as I need to use the attaxhments</li>
    <li> I own the Phillips BG2040 and its battery had stopped holding a charge. I thought I&#x27;d update to this model thinking it would be an improvement, it is a BIG step down in quality. The BG2040 is made with metal and the unit makes a quiet humming sound while THIS unit is considerably louder, cheaper sounding even and its construction and attachments leave a lot to be desired. I regret buying this unit and will look at other models.</li>
    <li> I probably should have only given this product one star but found some redeeming qualities for the first two months.  Then the hair from cutting my beard got into the machine...not easy to clean when there is lubricating grease all over the inside. The hair trimmers are difficult at best to slide to the proper height as the plastic doesn&#x27;t move very smoothly. Then after six weeks the small plastic trimmer started sounding like a chain saw.  Unfortunately too late to return...almost sixty days... and so I&#x27;ll give it away and start looking all over again.  Very surprise Norelco would manufacture a product like this....</li>
    <li> More then what I expected.  Easy to use and well worth the money.  I would recommend this product to others</li>
    <li> Enjoyed it, thank you</li>
    <li> it does the job, but the batteries die quick.</li>
    <li> Relatively good&lt;br /&gt;But has the body of plastic and crashing quickly</li>
    <li> I purchased this multi-groomer on sale for a very good price to replace the Norelco Vacuum trimmer. Although it initially cut through my rather short beard very well, it seems to be dying after only three short months of use. I&#x27;m not sure if the issue is the battery or the mechanics of the trimmer, but this morning it would barely cut for a minute before dying after being on the charger overnight. Given the lack of vacuum and longevity, I would probably pass on this trimmer and go for the vacuum model. Your beard and your wife will thank you!</li>
    <li> Works really well for my shaving needs!. And the charge holds for a long time too!. I would definitely buy again,.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas (although he picked it out).  He loves it! He says it is a 1000x better than his last electric razor.  He has used this to shave his neck, chest, and face.  He says it gives his chest a really close shave without giving him any razor burn like a normal razor would. I got this when it had a $5 off instant rebate and I think it is an excellent quality at a great price.  I would have been willing to pay more for this because he is so pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I got this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he loves it! His old one used to pull his hair out instead of actually shaving it off, so it&#x27;s a nice upgrade for him. Holds a charge for quite a while and gives a clean cut every time! Very happy with what we got everything is good quality too!</li>
    <li> Very happy with, i like cleaning it with water without any problems!</li>
    <li> My husband still loves his and I purchased it for him Father&#x27;s Day 2013, great producy</li>
    <li> I use it all the time, can say it is durable and made with quality. I use it in the shower and dry, never fails.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for about 3 weeks now. Honestly, i cant recommend it when there are better options (phillips norelco ys524 and panasonic er-gb40 are ones that i&#x27;ve reviewed recently, can recommend, and fit this price range). Here are my observations during my testing period:&lt;br /&gt;(1) the motor is powerful and it does deliver a relatively clean cut but conversely it is LOUD and vibrates alot. and thats without the &#x27;turbo&#x27; mode this device comes with.&lt;br /&gt;(2) cheap plastic comb attachments and horrible implentation (probably the worst i&#x27;ve seen yet). They are hard to attach/remove + add in the cheap quality and i really have no doubt they will break eventually.&lt;br /&gt;(3) the shaving tools themselves are ok though.just a bit of trouble to attach them&lt;br /&gt;(4) they put a huge power button right in the middle which is also relatively sensitive to pressing. during usage my hand occasionally pressed it and closed the machine.</li>
    <li> I received this about 2 weeks ago, plugged it in and charged for the hour specified in the manual. I shaved once with it, for about 10 minutes and everything worked fine, in fact it&#x27;s one of the better shavers I&#x27;ve used. 3 days later, I went to use it again, and it was completely dead. The manual said that battery life on a full charge should be about 50 minutes. So, I charged it again, and it won&#x27;t even turn on. For the price, it&#x27;s ridiculous that the product failed so completely and quickly.</li>
    <li> Lots of attachments and you can pretty much use it all over your body. Easy to clean and you can use it in the shower. Charges fast too.</li>
    <li> This is a deal not to be missed,  I&#x27;ve been looking for a machine like this for awhile now and would recommend it to any do it yourself-er!</li>
    <li> A little smaller than i thought.  I like the ease of use very simple to use.  i would recommend it to my friends</li>
    <li> Works as expected. My husband has very coarse hair and it buzzes thru with no problems. Multiple heads make it easy for him to only need 1 razor (although he does still use a disposable razor for that super smooth shave). We are pleased with this product and feel the price is good (I used a coupon for $5 off). So far so good. I expect this brand to last a long time, and will post an update if the item fails.</li>
    <li> The attachments were easy for me to change out. And it does a good&lt;br /&gt;job trimming my beard. It doesn&#x27;t do such a great job shaving my neck&lt;br /&gt;or my chin under my beard. But is over all good for trimming.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a good body trimmer, this is the one. Trust me and use the &#x27;hair clipper&#x27; for trimming body areas instead of the body trimming clip; it just doesn&#x27;t work as well. Works great as a straight up shaver as well, and decent for your face too.</li>
    <li> The divice covered my expection and I recommend for many people that they want to give like a present for anybody.</li>
    <li> This multigroom pro could easily replace 3-4 different devices: bodygroomer, beard/face trimmer, nose/ear/eyebrow, and hair trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mainly chose this groomer for the first three uses, not trusting myself to cut my own hair trimmer. First, the quick charging ability of this item is a positive upgrade from current groomers that take hours or even overnight to charge. As other reviewers have noted, the plastic tray it comes with is too large and not useful unless you have a lot of space for it. The cloth case is much more practical for storing all of the attachments and guards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the mulitgrooom first on my beard. The guard has a wide range of settings, something that puts it above my current Wahl trimmer. The guard also collects some clippings, which keeps them from getting everywhere, though many also collect inside the removable head as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body groom works well, but no attachments fit it, so it&#x27;s all or nothing for that. The main trimmer works on most of the body if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nose trimmer is acceptable, as is the close face trimmer. I wonder how long some of these various attachments will last before wearing out or becoming dull. As of right now, how to replace one part is unclear. Still, if you need to replace a trimmer or want to make room in your bathroom drawer, this is worthy of your consideration.</li>
    <li> Totally worth the money ! You&#x27;ve got pretty much everything in there, though the adjustable combs and pouch could have been of better quality.</li>
    <li> I used to have one of the older philips multigroom devices and used most of the attachments provided. When my charger got bitten by my dog I decided it might be time to get a new one, so I stumbled upon this model while searching and decided to purchase it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does what it&#x27;s suppose to do, but I feel the attachments are not as friendly to use as the previous ones and they way they&#x27;re designed seems to be lacking as well. I&#x27;d probably look for another model when I purchase my next one</li>
    <li> I use it perhaps once a week to trim the beard.  This is well constructed and reliable and does everything it claims to do.  I particularly like it that the plastic head guards that fit over the trimmer are made of a flexible-yet-durable plastic, and are easy to release when you&#x27;re finished with them.  I also like the separate trimmer head for the body hair as well.  I was a bit leary about using it &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34; but finally did without nicks or punctures.  I&#x27;d like to be able to give myself a haircut with the hair guard, and you can get the top and sides but who knows what it looks like in the back.  So my wife does the back of the head, and she likes this machine, too.  If this one ever wears out, I&#x27;ll get another one, same model and make.</li>
    <li> This unit has served me well over time, am still getting used to its various attachments and their recommended uses. I must admit that I would appreciate if its cutting blade was little sharper for close shaping work on my beard. But other than this I am enjoying the freedom this machine gives me for quick and easy grooming on mornings when am running late.</li>
    <li> The Multigroom when charged is a turbo cutter.  It provides consistent, high-quality shaves and cuts.  I expect to continue using this line of products for many years.</li>
    <li> I recently stopped shaving, it was irritating my skin too much and causing ingrown hairs. So I just use a trimmer like this to get it pretty close. This also happens to be a much faster way to clean myself up. The battery life is ok, it has a turbo mode for I don&#x27;t know what, but its there. Overall very happy and would recommend this over any other option.</li>
    <li> Like the setting feature</li>
    <li> I guess I was sold on the packaging. It looks like a quality product in the box but when I opened everything is very thin plastic. I tried out a few of the attachments and I don&#x27;t think this thing could groom the fuzz on a peach. I can&#x27;t believe there are actually positive reviews on this product. What are you guys shaving? I never write reviews on anything but this shaver real pisses me off.</li>
    <li> This is a product that ACTUALLY works!&lt;br /&gt;A great tool that covers all needs, upstairs and downstairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it a 5-star rating just for the sheer flexibility and ease of use, but in reality it should be a 4,5 score, with a deduction for the poor plastic feel/quality.. The ergonomic feel is fine, but it&#x27;s not a quality product made from grade A materials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, it&#x27;s still a great tool - No nips, no cuts if used correctly - so go buy it!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have a cheap-o groomer that I&#x27;ve had for years. I thought that it had quit working, so I felt the need to order a new one. I ran across this one and it sounded like a good one, so I ordered it. Got it in and put it on the charger, then tried to figure out how to attach one of two of the heads. Didn&#x27;t take me long to figure out that I didn&#x27;t really like it. First thing I noticed, was that while charging, it lights up a &#x27;charging&#x27; light on it. Well, MOST of the time it does.......... I came back in the room later on and noticed the light was out, so I unplugged it and plugged it back to get the light back on. Maybe it goes out when it&#x27;s fully charged, who knows. Seems to me it&#x27;d light up solid or blink or something like that to let you know it was fully charged; Dislike. The next thing was the multitude of heads. I figured out that I really didn&#x27;t need a dozen (figuratively) different heads to groom myself, so it seemed like it&#x27;d be a hassle to keep up with all of them and the box it came in wouldn&#x27;t do a good job of keeping them stashed; Dislike. Lastly, it depends on which head you use as to how it mounts; some of the heads mount one way (like pointing towards the bottom) and some of them mount the other (pointing towards the top), in other words backwards of each other. So in some cases when you mount one the on/off button is where you&#x27;d grab it and you accidentally turn the thing on or off, and it doesn&#x27;t come natural to know which way the head goes on in the first place, so you&#x27;re having to fiddle with to figure it out; Dislike. It might be ok for some people, but not for me. So, bottom line is, I packed it back up and sent it back.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this trimmer. It&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve ever used (not that that&#x27;s a huge sample size, but I&#x27;ve been disappointed by several Remington trimmers). It charges quick, has plenty of power, and I like the end result. I haven&#x27;t had a single issue with it yet and the assortment of attachments is great. One discrepancy though; mine arrived with a detail trimmer attachment instead of the ear/nose hair trimmer. It works out better for me as I find more use for the detail trimmer, but I thought people should know.</li>
    <li> God product at a fair price.&lt;br /&gt;Tons of attachments.&lt;br /&gt;I have always had a Norelco electric razor for those days that I cannot bare another blade so this was a good fit.</li>
    <li> I had been reading reviews and pricing out these groomers for months now.  Some are very expensive and do not seem worth it.  I had a previous Norelco model that was dying slowly (battery took for ever to charge and ran out quickly.  The shields also wouldn&#x27;t stay on during a &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34;).  I found this one on Amazon and thought I would give it a shot due to the ratings and price.  I am very happy that I did.  This one works so much better than my previous ones.  When I am shaving my &amp;#34;areas&amp;#34; I am not worried about accidental cuts or pulling of the hairs.  It is quiet which is key when you are doing your grooming because you don&#x27;t want to be in the bathroom for an extended period of time using something that might sound like some sort of adult toy when you are married with kids.  Desecrate is always a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum it up, this thing does the job very well.  My body is smooth and nick free.  The only minor knock on the product is that most of the changeable heads for it are plastic and i am a little worried about how long it will last.  For now though I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> it looks bit cheap but works well. I have been using it for last month or so and looks durable to me if handle with care.</li>
    <li> This does the job as expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;- Does the job with minimal fuss.&lt;br /&gt;- Comes with a plastic tray that seats the pieces&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;- the attachment mechanism for choosing a length setting is a bit clumsy.&lt;br /&gt;- The different heads feel flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;- Noisy</li>
    <li> I tried MANY types of shavers, trimmers etc.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is very sensitive so I only use electric trimmers. This is the best I&#x27;ve seen because it is waterproof and comes with several accessories for every type of beard you want to do. TOO easy to fit accessories, unlike some reviews I saw here.</li>
    <li> Grandson requested this razor for Christmas.  I picked out several and then let him pick the final features.  He seems to be quite pleased and since he is currently sporting a beard, he is using it to keep a tidy beard.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what i needed. It puts in work on my nose, arms, legs and facial hair. Its good that i dont have to shave off the hair completely. I would recommend. The only problem is that it feels like the heads can break easily while changing them</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews for this product,I decided to give it a try.  And I can say that all the positive reviews were dead on.  It really does work.  I will not go into personal details, as others have already posted them.  But I can tell you that I am completely satisfied and happy with this product.</li>
    <li> This is the first grooming kit I&#x27;ve had where I feel like there&#x27;s too much to play with. Plenty of attachments and options here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used this for my face. I can&#x27;t grow a thick, lustrous beard like some men can, but my sub-par beard does need maintenance when it gets to the annoying stage. I can trim the hair pretty short, and then fine-tune with my razor. I&#x27;d like to compare this to other sets out there, but I simply haven&#x27;t tried many. I feel like a secret agent when I break out this set and begin tinkering with the attachments and whatnot. It&#x27;s cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is supposedly safe to use in the shower, but I&#x27;m not going to try. I never groom in the shower, so I&#x27;m not going to risk any dangers.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a G370 that stopped charging.  I really like the older model, and this one is even better.  Charges quicky and  the battery last well even with the turbo on.  All of the attachments work really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Only minor complaints would be the heads are a little difficult to change and i could see them breaking easy if you forced something.  Once you get used to how they connect it&#x27;s not as big an issue.  The trimming guards are also a little hard to attach and don&#x27;t hold in place that well.  I could see someone accidentally pushing them down and getting a shorter trim than they wanted, although this hasn&#x27;t happened to me.</li>
    <li> Good price for and very good gift.</li>
    <li> I got this gift for my boyfriend for christmas of &#x27;13 and he uses it all of the time! after this I also found out that my roommate had the same exact one, for the Amazon price this shaver is perfect! In store i believe it can sell up too 80$.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only CON i have on this product is that sometimes their is pulling of the hairs or without the perfect angle some spots can be missed, this is with only SOME of the multiple shaver that can be attached. Over all my boyfriend loves this product and so do I!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Asian and not hairy so these kind of products aren&#x27;t purchased often.  I&#x27;m replacing an older Philips grooming kit whose plugin charger just broke apart.  There are many attachments and a convenient carrying case.  There is a turbo button which makes no difference on my body but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll help somebody.  The build quality is solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one gripe is that the unit does not work while charging.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure it ever worked properly.  I have no idea who might use this trimmer successfully.  Maybe it&#x27;s for dolls?  It takes forever to charge and a charge hardly lasted through a trim.  The &#x27;turbo&#x27; button almost brings it up to speed.  Otherwise you might as well pull the hairs out one by one.</li>
    <li> female person here. I&#x27;ve used this for a few months (with the body shave attachment on only) and it&#x27;s amazing; no snagging, pulling, cutting. ladies: don&#x27;t be fooled by &amp;#34;bikini trimmers&amp;#34; marketed to women. get the real deal. this thing is great.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is just mediocre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  It comes with a bunch of attachments that aren&#x27;t intuitive at all.  You have to try to read the microscopic print on users&#x27; manual which is actually a sheet of paper folded up a million ways like some kind of origami experiment.  Said attachments are flimsy and feel crappy and undoubtedly will break quickly.  Since I can&#x27;t figure out how to use most of them, they are just sitting in the nice little chintzy zippered bag included in the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  The charger is not an induction charger like most good trimmers have.  Instead, it&#x27;s a weird little plug-in thing which is very hard to tell which way it plugs in.  Furthermore, there is no stand, so the whole trimmer just lays on it&#x27;s side wherever you decide to plug it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  It trims well enough, but overall build quality feels third-rate to me.  Basically feels like some cheapo made in China but with the Norelco name slapped on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are much better trimmers out there at similar price points.</li>
    <li> For some reason the term \\&quot;all in one\\&quot; resonates as \\&quot;technologically advanced\\&quot; for people. For me unless it&#x27;s a computer or a phone it says \\&quot;not great in any specific area, just good all around\\&quot;. And this is exactly that. Before I got this I had the Bodygroom Pro and a regular beard trimmer with a vacuum feature which was super nice, both are Philips Norelco which I stand by as the best when it comes to these devices. I didn&#x27;t need this but I always like to test out new man grooming gadgets. I found that since it doesn&#x27;t have a specific specialty that all its features are just average. It&#x27;s a cool thing to have, especially for traveling, but in the end your sacrificing quality for versatility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beard trimmer is not that precise but it gets the job done, the body groom is a fixed head, and the length attachments are quite flimsy. The nose trimmer is pretty good, I&#x27;ve never used one before but tested it out and no nicks or cuts. The portability and versatility make this a great all around device, but I much prefer having a dedicated face trimmer and a dedicated body trimmer. The interchangeable attachments are kind of cheap plastic as well. I only let my barber touch my hair so the hair trimming feature didn&#x27;t appeal to me at all. Again, worth it if you&#x27;re a traveler but spend a little more and get devices designed for specific parts of the body.</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco Q3380 really appears to be the Jack of all trades, here. Even getting the box open and getting all the pieces organized took quite a bit more time than I had expected due to the number of accessories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the effort by Philips to label the packaging so you can reattach all the... attachments to it, I&#x27;d say don&#x27;t waste your time. Throw the attachments in your bathroom drawer and be done with it. I don&#x27;t have room to lay out yet another tray on my counter, and I&#x27;ll assume most people out there don&#x27;t, either! (The included case has enough room the shaver, the charger, and all the attachments).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, a recommendation: Keep the manual! It&#x27;s a fold-out affair, with numerous pictures and guidelines. e.g. \\&quot;Do not use the Groomer (one of the attachments) to shave facial or scalp hair. The Groomer should only be used on skin below the neckline.\\&quot; How would you know this without reading the manual, right? Keep it. Throw it in the drawer with all the attachments!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I charged the device up (took just under an hour from empty to full charge, which is really speedy), and this gives you 50 minutes of usable time when full. Also, handily, the charger is a 100-240v part, so you can take this pretty much anywhere in the world without need of a voltage converter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using The Thing:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you get over the shaver being a rather (entirely) plastic affair, the unit feels great in-hand. The attachments that need to be metal are, of course, metal. I immediately used the ear-hair/nose-hair clipper, and it did a tremendous job removing some rogue hairs that were intent on shaming me if I left the house without murdering them. Begone, hair! Success!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for me, I&#x27;m used to my wife clipping my (ever-balding) head. We always use a 1/4 inch blade on a...ahem... dog clipper (hey, it works!). So to make the transition to the Philips Norelco, I used the clipper attachment (on by default), and the head-clipper comb set to 6mm, which is 0.236 inches. Right, you can&#x27;t get exactly 0.25 inches. Not the end of the world. Anyway, with slight trepidation, I had my wife clip my hair to \\&quot;1/4\\&quot; inch today. The manual actually suggests you don&#x27;t do this for your first-time clipping so as to get used to the system. You&#x27;re supposed to be conservative about the length. But I said humbug, and went for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results?:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent! As suspected, my hair came in just a.. uh... hair shorter than with my old trimmer with the 1/4 inch comb, but really - almost unnoticeably so. Very clean lines. My wife said it was super easy to clip my head, and because it was so consistent she didn&#x27;t have to follow up with scissors like she did with the pet clipper. Awesome! For doing the nape of my neck, the comb was removed, and she was easily able to tidy me up. Great results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only real cons I can find to the Philips Norelco QG3380 is that it does tend to feel a tad cheap. Also, there&#x27;s a white grease in every attachment where they meet the main unit, and after switching back and forth between several pieces, the grease is a little all over the place in inside of the attachments. And hair tends to get stuck to it. Hopefully this doesn&#x27;t become an issue the more I use this device. It likely won&#x27;t, but it&#x27;s still worth mentioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a nice all-in-one unit. No longer do you have to reach for multiple devices to manscape yourself. This Philips Norelco does the job, and I can finally retire my pet clipper. Yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars out of 5.t to 6mm, which is 0.236 inches. Right, you can&#x27;t get exactly 0.25 inches. Not the end of the world. Anyway, with slight trepidation, I had my wife clip my hair to \\&quot;1/4\\&quot; inch today.

    <li> I was interested in this product mainly for it&#x27;s body shaving capabilities as a replacement for my [[ASIN:B0037HP9OA Philips Norelco BG2040 BodyGroom Pro]]. I am a triathlete and I shave my legs among other parts of my body :) I am not going to go into a lengthy explanation of why though, since it is hard to completely argue for it. Anyway, I was looking for a body shaver that was fast, gave a close shave and had good battery life, and this product delivered in spades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The full size trimmer is impressive, in areas where the hair was too long to shave initially, this trimmer easily chopped it down in seconds. Also, the new skin friendly design used for the tips of the trimmer make a huge difference and the skin is not irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver was just as good, one pass was enough to completely remove the hair (using it against the grain) and I particularly liked the Turbo feature. It should be said though that the setting with the Turbo is what would be comparable to other shavers, but having the ability of taking the Turbo off for sensitive areas was a big plus. I was worried that the 50 minute of battery life would only be true with the Turbo off but that is not the case. I measured the time it took for the battery to run out with the Turbo on 100% of the time and it was exactly 51 minutes. Talk about accurate advertisement! The fact that it can be charged in only an hour is also a huge plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned, my main focus was on the body grooming capabilities. I did try the precision trimmer, the mini foil shaver and the ear, nose and eyebrow trimmer and all of them removed the hair proficiently. It should be also mentioned that the three combs included provide for great flexibility regarding length you are aiming for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I love the fact that there is no charger, you just plug the cable directly into the groomer and this reduces clutter in my bathroom. The only thing I would have really liked is to be able to use it while it is charging, but that is not an available feature and since none of the others I have tried allow for this, it is not really fair to knock down the rating for not providing this ability.ile it is charging, but that is not an available feature and since none of the others I have tried allow for this, it is not really fair to knock down the rating for not providing this ability.</li>
    <li> works great. bought two years ago and still running great.</li>
    <li> When I first got it, it worked well. After a week of owning it however, I switched attachments, the moving parts inside are horribly setup, and bent in. This caused the device to not turn on at all. The way they lock in is awkward to attach until you get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This actually worried me at first, luckily I figured out it was attachment specific. Unfortunately I no longer can use the large foil shaver and am worried every time I switch accessories. Shouldn&#x27;t have thrown the box out so soon!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy it again. It feels cheap. I used the beard and hair clipping comb and both worked okay. The body groom was really weak. I bought this unit to replace a remington body groom and a wahl beard clipper. I&#x27;m happy with the Norelco in terms of beard clipping but the rest of it is pretty weak. My old remington body groom blow it away. So I&#x27;m disappointed because I wanted to replace two devices and charges with one and don&#x27;t think that will work out. If I were going to do it all over again, I&#x27;d buy something other than this unit. I expected a lot more for the higher cost.</li>
    <li> This is actually my second Norelco in which I&#x27;ve replaced my Remington pg250. The Philips Norelco QG3380/42 Multigroom Pro is an upgrade to my previous one. It&#x27;s a sturdy and powerful little trimmer. It comes with numerous attachments, few of which I will probably use though. Not real happy with the nose trimmer though. It seems a little awkward to use. I also don&#x27;t like the attachment holders. Very user unfriendly. Ziploc works much better. Still happy with it overall.</li>
    <li> -:¦:-A-:¦:-W-:¦:-E-:¦:-S-:¦:-O-:¦:-M-:¦:-E-:¦:-</li>
    <li> Simply stated, this shaver does its job and does it well.  Maybe not without a few minor annoyances that I&#x27;ll get to, but overall my experience with it has been a positive one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just unboxing the thing took a little effort due to its (approximately) 40 billion pieces, half of which want to jump out and make a break for it as soon as you open the plastic cover.  Now, it seems like maybe the plastic tray that everything is set in and its cover might be intended as reusable (there are little icons to help you determine what to put where if you&#x27;d want to put them back in place).  My suggestion: toss it, don&#x27;t even try to get everything back on there.  You&#x27;ll eventually fail and get frustrated and want to set it on fire.  Instead, you can use the \\&quot;deluxe\\&quot; pouch, which is big enough for all attachments, the shaver, and the cord.  It is decidedly not \\&quot;deluxe\\&quot;, however, being only slightly less plasticky and more reusable than a plastic sandwich baggie. Don&#x27;t expect much from that thing.  But it does the trick, it&#x27;s big enough to hold everything, and as yet hasn&#x27;t disintegrated (although the other two shavers in the comparison in the product description have a non-\\&quot;deluxe\\&quot; bag and I have to wonder exactly how you could GET less \\&quot;deluxe\\&quot; than this thing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the shaver itself has proven to be better in just about every regard than the two units it replaces in my drawer: the [[ASIN:B000EG8HLE Philips Norelco Bodygroom]] and the [[ASIN:B0002D5Y92 Panasonic ER421KC Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer]]. Even though I purchased those both in 2009, it&#x27;s still more expensive to buy them together than it would be to just buy this QG3380. And the QG3380 is capable of much more than the other two combined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a body groomer the QG3380 performs admirably, working faster and more consistently than the Bodygroom.  No pulling, always very comfortable.  The nose/ear trimmer is exceptional. That Panasonic was underpowered (single AA battery) and was only slightly better than reaching in and ripping the hair out of your nose. The QG3380 is such a distinct improvement that I have trouble even comparing them.  No pain whatsoever, no pinching, smooth and simple to use.  The beard trimmer is equally a pleasure -- I hardly felt a thing.  The attachments are smooth and solid, and allow you to change the trim size without switching out attachments. You can select the size by clicking a slider into place next to the number (in millimeters) that suits your style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for that alone, with such a great performance, it should be worth 5 stars.  It WOULD be worth 5 stars to me.  But it&#x27;s not all perfection.  At first glance, it looks really nice! Gloss black with that brushed aluminum trim... yeah, sorry.  The entire thing is plastic except for the \\&quot;business\\&quot; parts of the various attachments.  The body, power buttons, and attachments themselves are plastic.  The front face of the whole unit feels somewhat cheap, and to make matters worse, the buttons have that sort of \\&quot;give\\&quot; when pressing them that makes them feel poorly engineered, almost loose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m disappointed in that (and I&#x27;d say it feels overall even less sturdy than the Bodygroom) but whether that will eventually present a problem in the form of breaking parts or just prove to be an unfounded concern, only time will tell. One thing is for sure, I&#x27;ll update as necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One final note, the instruction manual suggests routinely rinsing out the attachments with warm water after use, and in some cases that will be necessary every time.  For example, the full-size trimmer gets hair all over the inside of it.  Every attachment came with a dab of white grease to lubricate where the drive shaft mates with the attachment, but I don&#x27;t see that lasting long; I hope it&#x27;s not important.  After just one use of the trimmer, I ran it under the faucet and found bits of white grease coming out on the teeth.better than reaching in and ripping the hair out of your nose.

    <li> I&#x27;ve used several Norelco grooming kits over the years, so I thought I&#x27;d try this set (as I needed to replace my old one).  The Multigroom Pro features the usual brushes, attachments and guards we&#x27;ve come to expect from these kits -- you can trim your hair, your beard, around a goatee, clean up your neckline hair or your sideburns and trim nasty nostril hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attachments sit within a plastic tray and snap into place, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about the brushes and attachments tumbling out if you move the tray around.  I liked that feature in particular.  I also liked that the trimmers don&#x27;t abrade the skin (a big plus!), the unit is cordless and relatively small, it doesn&#x27;t require any batteries (charges up to one hour of use) and it&#x27;s waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find all of the attachments useful, but I did not like the one for trimming nostril hair.  Because the blades are only on one side of the attachment (you can use it for eyebrow trimming too), it&#x27;s not as easy to manipulate within your nose like trimmers that use rotating blades within a thin nozzle-like attachment.  I&#x27;d have to say that that&#x27;s my one disappointment with this grooming kit, and it&#x27;s why I couldn&#x27;t give it a five-star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I think there are other grooming kits on the market that are cheaper than $69.99 that can give you similar value.  I&#x27;d recommend shopping around for other name brands and even other Norelco products, depending on your grooming needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, though, the Multigroom Pro is a solid, versatile grooming tool.  And because it comes with a soft zip-up pouch, it&#x27;s also a good option for travel.</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco QG3380/42 Multigroom Pro has numerous attachments for trimming, including a foil body shaver and comb, hair clipper, full trimmer, detail trimmer, tube nose trimmer, full metal guard, detail foil shaver, beard and mustache comb and stubble comb. As far as I can determine, only the Remington Complete Grooming System comes close to matching this for the number of functions (it has six attachments, but at about one-third the price).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I have not used any competing multi-grooming products, I will limit this review to the Philips Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the system to trim my mustache and nose hair. It was easy to switch the various attachments in and out. They only fit one way, so there is no possibility for installing them incorrectly. Personally, I prefer my Wahl for trimming my mustache. The Wahl has a smoother action and (with self sharpening solid steel blades) seems never to be dull. The Philips Norelco required considerably more effort to do a clean job of trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nose hair trimmer did not do as good a job as my MANGROOMER Essential Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer. Long, curly and stiff hairs were not removed without excessive effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loaned the system to a friend who reported, \\&quot;As you know, I have a full beard. The adjustable attachments fit easily onto the shaver. I found quickly the proper adjustment for my beard. I removed the attachment for trimming the neck portion of my beard. However, the cutting attachments do not fit easily onto the shaver body. It took some twisting to find the proper angle to attach them. All in all, it worked very well and gave a smooth, clean trim to my beard. I liked it.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, the Philips Norelco gives high versatility with a slight sacrifice of quality. Devising a system to provide so many functions is no small feat, and I give it four stars to acknowledge a good (but not excellent) try.</li>
    <li> I liked this product a lot.  I do not have a lot of hair all over, and I do not like hair all over.  I have used this to shave my arm pits, \\&quot;sensitive area\\&quot; and facial hair.  It works wonderfully.  You get a lot of attachments, so it will work with virtually any hair type.  It charges very quickly and if you are in a rush, a 5 minute charge is more than enough for a quick shave.  It has a turbo button for an extra burst of power but I didn&#x27;t need it for my hair.  It is shower ready, but avoid submerging it in water.  5 stars all the way.</li>
    <li> Ok lets start out by saying I am 1/2 Gorilla. I needed a upgrade from my last trimmer (WAHL) due to its ability to cut me without trying. I read the reviews of the few people who got this item before it went on sale, sent to them for free. I will not give this item the same BS lip service. I bought and paid for mine, therefore I will give you my REAL write up, without the FLUFF. I used the Body trimmer, for obvious reasons, (insert banana joke here) It took MULTIPLE passes over the same area to get the hair off. It did Cut me once, although this is a huge improvment over my last trimmer. As I was using it, I noticed the &amp;#34;TURBO&amp;#34; button and chuckled.. HEH turbo on a trimmer. I pushed it, and suprisingly enough it did help slightly on the trimming. Alot of attachements in this set, and the trimmer was easy to hold and use.( much like my Norelco 3D shaver.) The Nose hair trimmer seemed to work, but I had to spin it  around and around while inside my nose to get it to cut the unwanted hairs, not like the circular ones I have used in the past. It did work, But would another trimmer for MUCH less money give the same result? Probably.</li>
    <li> I purchased the original Philips BodyGroom shortly after it appeared on the market.  I have to say that this product seems to work much better than that one at body grooming.  The motor seems more powerful (it lasts longer per charge, and it just sounds more powerful).  Even when I put a new blade on my BodyGroom, it seemed to snag certain hairs instead of cutting them quickly, causing a bit of discomfort.  I haven&#x27;t had that experience with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also used a dedicated nose hair trimmer (Panasonic brand, but I&#x27;m not sure of the model number).  It did such a poor job and was so uncomfortable that I returned to using a small pair of scissors to trim my nose hair.  This product does a surprisingly good job at nose hair trimming, with no discomfort or nicking of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, this product also has attachments to do various other types of grooming as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why am I giving this product only 4 stars instead of 5:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  The manual is poorly written.  I don&#x27;t have it in front of me as I&#x27;m writing this review so I cannot give specifics, but throughout the manual I noticed that the instructions for using a specific attachment to do a specific type of grooming were presented in a more convoluted way than necessary.  If you need to do A, then B, then C, and then D to accomplish the task, the manual will say do A, do C, do B, do C, and do D.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  More significant than the poorly written manual is the mechanism to exchange attachments.  Maybe this is something I&#x27;ll get used to, but so far it seems far more difficult to change attachments than it should be.  It really should be easy to twist off one, determine how the next one needs to be aligned, and then twist the new one on.  Sadly, the twisting off is easy but determining how to align the next one and then getting it to twist on and lock in place isn&#x27;t always easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d still recommend this product, though, and am happy to finally have a multipurpose groomer that does such a good job.</li>
    <li> In my opinion this is the very best body shaver I&#x27;ve ever used. My last norelco shaver lasted me over 10 years; therefore, if I can expect even half of that with this product I would consider that a plus. The body shaver gets close and never nicked me once. I couldn&#x27;t believe how genital this was even when I wasn&#x27;t. I took the bare blades and used them under my arm pits to see if they would bite, I was pleasantly surprised that they were very smooth. I&#x27;ve recommended these to close friends of mine and I would recommend them to you too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m fairly hirsute and was impressed by the ability of this shaver to get me pool-ready.  I have another Norelco shaver (a dual head model without the ability to swap out heads) and like this one much better.  The downside is that I have to store a bag of accessories rather than just the unit like the dual-head model.</li>
    <li> For $60 at the time of this review, this is a solid performing and versatile groomer. It has attachments for trimming hair off every kind of body part. The only thing we haven&#x27;t used this for so far is a hair cut (head), but based on the performance so far, I think this would perform acceptably for simple boy&#x27;s/ men&#x27;s haircuts as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading. I hope this review was helpful!</li>
    <li> As a man who keeps his beard short and his hair even shorter, I put a lot of demands on a trimmer/shaver, and have gone through many of them. None are perfect. The closest I&#x27;ve ofund before the Norelco QG3380 discused here was the [[ASIN:B004WIUNCG Braun Cruzer 6 Beard &amp; Head Trimmer 1 Count]], which is an excellent value and a very competent groomer. But the Norelco is better. It has multiple heads for great flexibility, though the majority of grooming is done with the main metal guard trimmer. There&#x27;s a turbo boost button that raises the power output, and it works well for thick patches of beard or head hair. Where the Braun would get bogged down, this Norelco keeps going. The various combs work very well, and offer a greater range of adjustments than built-in ones. I&#x27;ve also used the precision trimmer, which is great for maintaining the edge of your beard line, though you wouldn&#x27;t want to use it for a large area. The nose and ear trimmer is likewise effective, and the fact that it can be washed is important for hygiene and \\&quot;ick\\&quot; factor. Battery life is excellent, even with turbo use. It charges up to full in a little over an hour, and maintains charge for as long as I&#x27;ve ever gone between trimmings (2 weeks or so) and probably longer than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what don&#x27;t I like? The aesthetics and usability of the design. Starting with one of the worst packaging atrocities I&#x27;ve ever seen, with the myriad parts displayed in a plastic shell that will surely scatter them all over once you manage to get it open. Then there&#x27;s the matter of graphics: who thought black-on-black markings are appropriate for minute adjustments? The length scale on the combs is virtually impossible to read, so I go by number of clicks. It would have been easy to add a white or red indicator line so you could actually see what you&#x27;re doing, but style (or idiocy) won out here. Ever heard of contrast? No - a fact you&#x27;ll appreciate when you try to find a specific (solid black) attachment in theprovided all-black bag. There&#x27;s nothing to do but dump the contents out and look for the item you want, because absolutely everything is black. Considering how much thought and care went into the engineering of the thing, it&#x27;s truly appalling how little went into design and usability. This is one category where the Braun beats out the Norelco handily, but then Braun has a long history of great industrial design. But still, overall this one&#x27;s a winner. Not perfect, but very, very good.</li>
