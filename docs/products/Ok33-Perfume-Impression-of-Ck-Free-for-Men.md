      <li>I&#x27;ve even tried applying a much heavier amount than I normally would</li>
      <li>But all things considered, at the end of the day, I would rather spend the extra forty dollars on a special extra something for my apartment than on a bottle of cologne that smells pretty much the same if you ask me.</li>
      <li>Keep in mind that you&#x27;re buying an impostor / imitation of CK Free.  </li>
      <li>this product help for complete anything.</li>

    <li> Keep in mind that you&#x27;re buying an impostor / imitation of CK Free.  Given that CK Free costs more by a factor of at least six, up to possibly ten, this is an AMAZING value. It&#x27;s a very similar scent, though not identical, and it is SO inexpensive.  It&#x27;s a pleasant, light, and sweet aroma, not overpowering but not weak either.  My lady says that she can smell it at the end of the day just as she can at the beginning of the day, and you get a healthy amount of it in the bottle.  Additionally, my experience with the seller was very positive. They initially sent me the wrong item, then allowed me to keep that item (which I also liked) and sent me this, the correct item, with very little delay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like CK Free and you don&#x27;t care about an exact replication of it, this product is pretty much ideal for you.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product...can&#x27;t tell it from the original and you can&#x27;t beat the price. I will look for other perfumes to purchase.</li>
    <li> even if its a cheap one, dont hesitate in buying this perfume,nice lasting smell, it was a gift and who received was very pleased, recommended,</li>
    <li> My impression was I gave order for CK, not OK; the fragrance is good but it does not sustain-fades soon, so I am not in favor.</li>
    <li> Scents are a personal matter. I prefer and strong one; however the scent was pleasant. I&#x27;ll use it up, but won&#x27;t re-order.</li>
    <li> This cologne smells as much like the designer brand as you could probably get for the price you pay for it on amazon I will tell you that much for sure. It&#x27;s a great value! Under $10 and free shipping! That&#x27;s not to say that it doesn&#x27;t smell like you paid more than $10 for a knockoff because it really does smell like the ck brand so I guess I could have started off saying that instead. But all things considered, at the end of the day, I would rather spend the extra forty dollars on a special extra something for my apartment than on a bottle of cologne that smells pretty much the same if you ask me.</li>
    <li> thank you for this i tame i like it&lt;br /&gt;it was very nice thank you for every thing  good e time</li>
    <li> IF U LIKE CK 1 U WILL ENJOY THIS AND THE PRICE SAME SMELL! I USE THIS AT A WEDDING THIS WEEKEND AND HAD A LOT OF COMPLIMENTS!</li>
    <li> It smells great, lasts long, and cost me 3.50 at my local Big Lots store. I&#x27;ll have to go back and get more before they run out of these</li>
    <li> Nothing but a great product, totally recommended...do no think twice before buying this product since you will not regret it.</li>
    <li> Hate to receive fake product&lt;br /&gt;will not recommend&lt;br /&gt;will not buy again from this company&lt;br /&gt;Poor package&lt;br /&gt;Did not expect to have fake product</li>
