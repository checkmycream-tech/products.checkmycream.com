<li> Within a few weeks this purse started falling apart, and it distributes weight horribly which causes arm and shoulder pain.</li>
<li> I am very disappointed with the color.</li>
<li> This is the worst purse ever.</li>

    <li> To big and bulky...when you tighten the straps they&#x27;re to long with the tassel and no snaps or other way to close the top.&lt;br /&gt;No likey!</li>
    <li> Within a few weeks this purse started falling apart, and it distributes weight horribly which causes arm and shoulder pain.</li>
    <li> So far so good, I have some concerns about the construction but haven&#x27;t had any issues yet.</li>
    <li> it had a couple of holes in the leather</li>
    <li> Poor quality. I wear it to times and is already ruined.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this purse!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really tiny, and the color is not the same.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a nice sized bag. It&#x27;s big enough to carry my things (water, keys, wallet, phone, phone charger, etc) when I leave the house to hang out with my friends. It&#x27;s cut and absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> I love the size and the overall look of this bag. However, the description states that the bag is brown. It is actually a hideous orange color. There is no way that anyone could ever think that this bag is brown, so the description is very misleading. I am very disappointed with the color.</li>
    <li> do not waist your money.  the heart broke off the first day I had it.  Very cheap,</li>
    <li> This is the worst purse ever. It fell apart right when I took it out.</li>
    <li> Fell apart too easy..</li>
    <li> Love it!!!!!! Supper cute😘</li>
    <li> I use the purse every single day. Its beautiful. The stitching for the inside was undone when i received it and after 2 days one of the pocket&#x27;s stitching came off. Other than that its pretty</li>
    <li> The color stinks, is completely different from picture</li>
