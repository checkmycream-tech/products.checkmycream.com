    <li> Very good wipes and the price is excellent.  I was buying a pack of 80 for $5.00 on sale but these wipes are larger and do just as good of a job cleaning.  They are not too wet so I don&#x27;t worry about having to dry the area before putting on the diaper (for my mom). The scent is almost non existent and my mom hasn&#x27;t had any problems with sensitivity or rash with this product.  I like buying in bulk and there are enough so I can keep some in the car and house.  I will be buying these again.</li>
    <li> Very multi-purpose product.  Good for household cleaning tasks.</li>
    <li> These are large, moist and sturdy, love them! Unfortunately, my sister passed away before being able to use them. This company is wonderful. I am hoping I can return without a hassle.&lt;br /&gt;Debbie</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Met all my needs.</li>
    <li> They meet the purpose and they hold up very well. I used other products but these seem to be much better.</li>
    <li> I purchase these for my parents and they work great. They are not cheap or light weight but good cleansing cloths. Also a very good buy.</li>
    <li> I am in a wheel chair and I have purchased these several times. They work as expected. My only complaint is that it is hard to pull them out one at a time. Most often I get 2 or 3 at a time.  I always get quick delivery from this supplier.</li>
    <li> Large sized wipe good for adult patient care</li>
    <li> These are kind of dry. There&#x27;s no pop-up dispensing so it can be a little difficult to work out the next wipe. It&#x27;s not like I won&#x27;t use them or anything, but am a little disappointed. Good price though.</li>
    <li> A wonderful convenience!  Freshens and cleans the skin.. Fragrance is light but leaves you feeling clean.  I use it for my mom- she has chronic bladder incontinence and also in between showers.  She is not able to shower often due to mobility but she uses these to bathe ibetwen showers and she feels clean and refreshed… skin is not irritated. I even use it for a quick fresh me up.</li>
    <li> Does the job. What can you say about basic items?</li>
    <li> They are good products and the price is reasonable. The shipping is also fast. I am satisfied.</li>
    <li> These are great clothes.  Great size and very sturdy.  The problem I have is that the tab doesn&#x27;t reseal very well, so the clothes can get dried out.  I have to set something on top of it or use some tape to keep it closed.</li>
    <li> I am a paraplegic and need wipes to really clean after going to the bathroom. Especially #2 if you know what I mean. It is not abrasive or too fragrant. Best deal I can find for the amount you receive. It&#x27;s amazing. I couldn&#x27;t live without these or else I&#x27;d be dead broke- no joke! Thanks please keep selling this product. Oh and they are very sturdy and don&#x27;t rip. They are large and do the job better than the leading expensive ones. One great plus is that you receive them within a couple days. I&#x27;ve been a buyer since my accident in 2013 and hopefully will be for many more years.</li>
    <li> Performs as expected.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and works out perfectly when applied in specific body areas</li>
    <li> Soothing and cleans well. Good for anywhere on the body.</li>
    <li> Great Value for the price.</li>
    <li> I just love these. They are large, soft wipes and great for quick clean-up&#x27;s. I keep one in my car just incase of dirty hands, face or something. These wipes are so much better and stronger than baby wipes. Try them! You will be glad you did.</li>
    <li> Good product.  A real problem solver for me.</li>
    <li> I order this on a regular basis for my mother and they are great!</li>
    <li> These wipes are very good.  They are large enough to clean well, are strong, have the right moisture level, the have a nice scent, and are reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> found them to exceed my expectations.</li>
    <li> although not flushable... superior to cottonelle and at same price for bulk</li>
    <li> Love these....just right for my needs.</li>
    <li> Reasonable price..prompt and reliable.</li>
    <li> The cloths are a nice size, but are pretty thin. Other than that, no complaints.</li>
