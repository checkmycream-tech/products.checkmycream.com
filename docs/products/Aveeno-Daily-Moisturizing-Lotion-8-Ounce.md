      <li>These squeeze tubes are great, very easy to squeeze out just the right amount, and while they sit upright on their caps, we are able to get the last drop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s creamy, not greasy, and really makes your skin feel nice.</li>
      <li>I hope this detailed review may help one person on the fence.</li>
      <li>If you enjoy scented lotions, try the Aveeno Stress Relief Moisturizing Lotion.</li>
      <li>lotion absorbs easily, it is smooth, healing and a creamy comforting addition to your day.</li>
      <li>Fragrance free?  </li>
      <li>I also enjoy using the Aveeno Body Wash and Soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My legs used to look like the cracked Mohave desert, but with Aveeno they are silky smooth.  </li>
      <li>It keeps my skin hydrated and smooth.  </li>
      <li>But, as far as having a handy lotion around for anyone to use, it is good for adults and young ones.</li>
      <li>If used as a daily lotion, it is good.</li>
      <li>While I&#x27;m not overly enthusiastic about the scent of this unscented product that is easily remedied by the addition of any essential oil I want to add before slathering this on my skin.</li>
      <li>I am happy to say, this lotion tops any other Aveeno product I have tried.  </li>
      <li>I apply lightly under my makeup (after applying my Roc products...which I recently discovered and are amazing)</li>
      <li>This is a 5 star product, worth every penny.</li>
      <li>, we find that our skin has thinned and is much more sensitive to sun and wind and any applied products.</li>
      <li>It seems to be more effective - and last longer - than most of the other products we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>This is a very effective moisturizer that&#x27;s not too greasy or too heavily scented.</li>
      <li>the price is right.</li>
      <li>Not greasy and absorbs right away.</li>
      <li>Pretty good, but a little waxy feeling to me.</li>
      <li>both of us find that we do better applying it morning and evening, especially in the winter, as we use wood heat.  </li>
      <li>Aveeno doesn&#x27;t irritate our skin, is non greasy and goes on smoothly, leaving our skin velvety and soft.  </li>
      <li>that that&#x27;s out of the way, the reason I rated this product 3 stars is because Aveeno seems to have changed its ingredients around from when I first bought this lotion.</li>
      <li>It comes from the tube nice and thick, doesn&#x27;t run as many of the products do, but applies to our skin smoothly, absorbing immediately.  </li>
      <li>A great product but a complaint about the tube.</li>
      <li>Now it&#x27;s the 7th, and the first ingredient is water, which I think has caused this lotion to be less effective than it used to be for me.</li>
      <li>It is a good lotion in that it is creamy and almost liquid like, so even a small amount lasts a while.</li>
      <li>Easy to use tube to set upside down for a quick release of lotion.  </li>
      <li>Aveeno moisturizes well and is light enough to go on under my face powder.</li>
      <li>and this is very soothing.</li>
      <li>and I love it because I live up North where it is reeeeally dry!</li>
      <li>I like the Aveeno Active Naturals Skin Relief better.</li>
      <li>As I look down the isles at the store, I can see that there are cheaper products to purchase, but folks, you get what you pay for and the quality of this lotion is the top of the line.  </li>
      <li>Such a great moisturizer..i have a dry skin and nothing was working for me in winter until i found this lotion in my make i bought it long time ago from store but didnt use it...</li>
      <li>and I both use this product and as we have gotten older</li>
      <li>It is not subtle AT ALL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The main ingredient seems to be Oat Kernel Flour</li>
      <li>and that is the main reason I buy this</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I have extremely dry skin, especially on my face, so I need a good moisturizer that would not clog pores, or make skin oily, but would also last all day</li>
      <li>It could be a little more moisturizing.</li>
      <li>Nor is it as strong as some other brands</li>
      <li>Glides on and leaves my skin smooth and soft where it was previously dry in places.</li>
      <li>She has problems with cystic acne for years due to Cushing&#x27;s Disease and wasn&#x27;t comfortable using a moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>Aveeno is the gold standard for light duty daily body moisturizing.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>combination dry/somewhat oily T- zone, rosacea, few fine wrinkles.  </li>
      <li>I used Neutrogena facial moisturizer for sensitive skin before this, and while it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin, it also didn&#x27;t seem to moisturize very well.</li>
      <li>This is my go-to lotion because I have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a 53 year old woman....</li>
      <li>(yes, I still do part of my dishes by hand...very therapeutic) and this keeps them looking and feeling soft.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> We have used Aveeno products now for several years and like them all.  I had always bought the hand pump Aveeno to keep in our bathrooms for after shower use but wanted something to keep on our end tables in the living room.  I like to apply lotion to my hands after doing dishes (yes, I still do part of my dishes by hand...very therapeutic) and this keeps them looking and feeling soft. These squeeze tubes are great, very easy to squeeze out just the right amount, and while they sit upright on their caps, we are able to get the last drop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband and I both use this product and as we have gotten older, we find that our skin has thinned and is much more sensitive to sun and wind and any applied products. Aveeno doesn&#x27;t irritate our skin, is non greasy and goes on smoothly, leaving our skin velvety and soft.  As I look down the isles at the store, I can see that there are cheaper products to purchase, but folks, you get what you pay for and the quality of this lotion is the top of the line.  It comes from the tube nice and thick, doesn&#x27;t run as many of the products do, but applies to our skin smoothly, absorbing immediately.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feel as so many of the products out there do, and within a minute or two, I get dressed without leaving most of the lotion on my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions state that it lasts 24 hours but both of us find that we do better applying it morning and evening, especially in the winter, as we use wood heat.  Anyone that has ever used wood heat knows what a penetrating heat it is any how drying it can be.  My legs used to look like the cracked Mohave desert, but with Aveeno they are silky smooth.  Different folks will probably react differently to this product but for us, it&#x27;s a winner.</li>
    <li> My skin is and always has been very dry especially in the winter.  I also use a lot of lotion in the summer because my skin has more exposure and I really don&#x27;t want it to look dry and scaly.    I recently wanted to try Aveeno Lotion because I think all their products are high quality.  I am happy to say, this lotion tops any other Aveeno product I have tried.  I love the way it hydrates my skin and I will be buying it just as a treat for my dry flaky skin.    Anyone who has arrid, crocodile skin like me should give this a try!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion in the tube.  The pump leaves WAY too much behind and is nearly impossible to get it all out.  This lotion really moisturizes without leaving a greasy feeling behind.  I also use it on my face with no problems.</li>
    <li> In just one week my face is clearer from using this specific lotion!!!! I feel moisturized all day and I love it because I live up North where it is reeeeally dry! Love love love!!</li>
    <li> Very nice lotion. I&#x27;ve been using this for 5 years.</li>
    <li> I like keeping a bottle in my car especially in the winter because the cold can be pretty rough of your skin. Wonderful product.</li>
    <li> It works well but washes away easily.</li>
    <li> Such a great moisturizer..i have a dry skin and nothing was working for me in winter until i found this lotion in my make i bought it long time ago from store but didnt use it... ...it did magic.my skin looks younger and soft all dry spots were gone....must have for me and prize is reasonale ..</li>
    <li> Everything has a smell. When Aveeno says that it is fragrance free that means they did not add any external fragrances to the product which can be irritating to some people. This product smells like cooked plain oats when initially applied, but that will go away after it absorbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that that&#x27;s out of the way, the reason I rated this product 3 stars is because Aveeno seems to have changed its ingredients around from when I first bought this lotion. Oat Flour (Avena Sativa) use to be its FIRST(most abundant) ingredient. Now it&#x27;s the 7th, and the first ingredient is water, which I think has caused this lotion to be less effective than it used to be for me.</li>
    <li> This is my go-to lotion because I have sensitive skin. It does not sting my cracked dry hands like other lotions can, has no scent, and does not feel greasy.</li>
    <li> While I&#x27;m not overly enthusiastic about the scent of this unscented product that is easily remedied by the addition of any essential oil I want to add before slathering this on my skin. The main ingredient seems to be Oat Kernel Flour and that is the main reason I buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The skin calming and healing qualities of oatmeal are almost immediately apparent. Within a few days of using this product you will notice a difference in your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion absorbs easily, it is smooth, healing and a creamy comforting addition to your day. If you enjoy scented lotions, try the Aveeno Stress Relief Moisturizing Lotion. I also enjoy using the Aveeno Body Wash and Soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to scent this product, buy some rose oil&lt;br /&gt;and add a few drops. Rose oil helps to balance your emotions&lt;br /&gt;and that in itself will help your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
    <li> My hands get very dry as I wear an arthritis wrist bracelet &amp; this moisturizer does its job.  Easy to use tube to set upside down for a quick release of lotion.  And, best of all, it was from the Amazon Store with free shipping available.&lt;br /&gt;J.L.F.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturiser! Glides on and leaves my skin smooth and soft where it was previously dry in places. Good price too!</li>
    <li> Have very dry skin. This takes away all dryness, flaking and itching. Not greasy and absorbs right away. No odor. Highly recommend. Love it</li>
    <li> Finally a lotion that my sensitive skin can handle.  I have been using this stuff for three months now, and I am able to use it on my body and face without irritation or breakout.  YAY!!!</li>
    <li> I buy Aveeno for my grand nephew who suffer from a bad case of eczema</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry skin, especially on my face, so I need a good moisturizer that would not clog pores, or make skin oily, but would also last all day and I am very happy with Aveeno&#x27;s product, I use it every morning and never have to worry about my skin drying out throughout the day. Also it&#x27;s not crazy expensive and the size and shape of the container is convenient for packing.</li>
    <li> best hand cream there is. Best I&#x27;ve ever tried. It&#x27;s not inexpensive, but if you want the best, this is it. I also buy generic versions of this whenever I can find them to save a couple bucks.</li>
    <li> This is a good lotion, but there are better out there. Pros: It is affordable and available at most stores. It is a good lotion in that it is creamy and almost liquid like, so even a small amount lasts a while. The smell is very mild. I find it locks the moisture in the skin well, as opposed to simply providing a creamy moisturization. Also, it has some beneficial ingredients compared to some lotions, such as the soothing oatmeal complex.&lt;br /&gt;The cons: While it is affordable in general, it is slightly pricey compared with other store brands. It could be a little more moisturizing. If used as a daily lotion, it is good. But if someone is looking for a lotion to help with severely dry skin, they may want to find a product that addresses that particular need. But, as far as having a handy lotion around for anyone to use, it is good for adults and young ones. Aveeno has products specifically for sensitive skin and dry skin as well.</li>
    <li> This is a very effective moisturizer that&#x27;s not too greasy or too heavily scented. It seems to be more effective - and last longer - than most of the other products we&#x27;ve tried. I have a couple of chronically dry spots - like my elbows - and the Aveeno seems to keep the skin moister and smoother than anything else I&#x27;ve tried in the price range.</li>
    <li> This is very nice lotion.  Non-scented. I have very sensitive skin and this is very soothing. Great for all the members of the family.  No conflict with perfume.  Good stuff and worth the price.  I have used this lotion for about a year now and it is on the \\&quot;must have list.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Always have loved this lotion and this is a great price plus you have many back ups.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 53 year old woman....combination dry/somewhat oily T- zone, rosacea, few fine wrinkles.  This lotion is the best for calming your skin....which mine easily blotches after cleansing or in sun.  I apply lightly under my makeup (after applying my Roc products...which I recently discovered and are amazing).....wait a few minutes, dab face and my makeup glides on.  Moisturizing without greasy/look or feel.  I also convinced my 35 year old daughter to try this product, she loves it as well.  She has problems with cystic acne for years due to Cushing&#x27;s Disease and wasn&#x27;t comfortable using a moisturizer.  I explained that very dry skin can cause your body to overproduce oils to compensate....thus more acne.  I hope this detailed review may help one person on the fence.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  My coworker let me use some of hers and I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since.  It&#x27;s creamy, not greasy, and really makes your skin feel nice.</li>
    <li> Fragrance free?  I don&#x27;t think so.  This reaks of oatmeal.  It is not subtle AT ALL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it might have been expired, so I check the crimp, nope, its not expired.  I would avoid this if you have a nose.</li>
    <li> I use this as a daily facial moisturizer. My skin reacts to most moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried. I used Neutrogena facial moisturizer for sensitive skin before this, and while it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin, it also didn&#x27;t seem to moisturize very well. Aveeno moisturizes well and is light enough to go on under my face powder.</li>
    <li> Stuff works, not sticky or greasy. Ends skin that looked like the floor of a desert mudflat.&lt;br /&gt;And the price is right.</li>
    <li> Pretty good, but a little waxy feeling to me. I like the Aveeno Active Naturals Skin Relief better. It feels better on my skin and soaks in nicely.</li>
    <li> This lotion is pricey, but it does the job for a daily moisturizer without being greasy or smelly.  I&#x27;m a guy, so I don&#x27;t want some fruity floral arrangement.  I want it to get it moist and get the job done.  This is a 5 star product, worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Got it for my son who has acne and also dry skin.  Seems like a conflict.  But this worked beautifully for him along with a cleanser I bought.  I&#x27;ll buy this again.</li>
    <li> My wife loves Aveeno.  This tube was a hit with her.</li>
    <li> I have never used this product before now and I am very impressed with it.  It keeps my skin hydrated and smooth.  There is no greasiness and it absorbs nicely.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I liked that this was light and hydrating for my hands. As an artist, I work with a lot of mediums that require me to wash my hands afterward (i.e. paints, oil pastels), so one can imagine that my hands are prone to dryness. However, after two weeks of use, I got an allergic reaction from the lotion in the form of tiny, non-itchy bumps on the backs of my hands. I gave the rest to my friend who does like Aveeno, but I&#x27;ll have to search for another hand lotion.</li>
    <li> Ave eno Daily Mois turizing Lotion , 8 Ounce , , nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice</li>
    <li> My husband gets severely chapped hands during the winter. When our doctor saw his hands, he recommended the Aveeno. We have been very pleased with its effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the better lotions out there.</li>
    <li> A great product but a complaint about the tube. As you use the product and it is, say, less than half full, it becomes harder and harder to squeeze it out of the tube, especially when you have the moisturizer on your hands. The plastic that the tube is made of is too hard to handle and you can&#x27;t fold it up (roll it up) they way you can with toothpaste. Nor is it as strong as some other brands so you can easily squeeze w/o needing to roll it up.</li>
    <li> This is a good lotion/moisturizer. I use it on my face because I have extra sensitive and combination/oily skin. I am proud to say that this lotion does not break me out and it helps to control my oil in a way (even though its not oil free). I recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin but if you have EXTREMELY oily skin I would say this may not be for you because it helps with oil about 85%.</li>
    <li> it mostrizing my skin perfectly i would order it next time and i suggested you to buy it , great result</li>
    <li> Aveeno is the gold standard for light duty daily body moisturizing. There are some store bran imitators out their, but Aveeno is the best!</li>
