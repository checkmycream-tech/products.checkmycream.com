    <li> I was given a prescription for calcium tablets, but I&#x27;m taking these instead because they are more easily absorbed, thanks to a better blend of vitamins and calcium.  They are also much smaller, so you take 4 a day.</li>

    <li> I use this product to prevent the medication called XGEVA which is to stop the spreading of cancer which has settled in my bones. OsteoMatrix works great I know because I take the shot every 21 days, and lab work is done to make sure your calcium levels are good or they will not give me the shot. Thank you Shaklee from Anita</li>
