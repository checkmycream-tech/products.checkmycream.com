      <li>I&#x27;ve read the reviews of the cheap knockoffs.</li>
      <li>I was happy to discover that these brushes work with both toothbrushes although they were not advertised as such.  </li>
      <li>in mind that your GUMS are equally as important as your teeth and are, in fact, the foundation for your teeth.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> very quick service and good price</li>
    <li> Bought these to fit my older model Braun. They fit perfect and clean well.</li>
    <li> Happy with my orders.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with product,price and seller,and Amazon as always does a great job!!! Unable to find at store anymore so found these at Amazon</li>
    <li> Just what I expected.</li>
    <li> They just last longer than the generic brands</li>
    <li> Great bargain!  Good price &amp; delivered promptly.  I&#x27;ll certainly buy them again!</li>
    <li> I had to send these back - even though it wasn&#x27;t noted on the website, these brushes are for sensitive teeth.  Even worse, because this was not under the Amazon Prime, I had to pay shipping to send them back, and I have yet to see my refund.  I purchased the brushes I wanted at another dealer, and will keep doing it this way.  It&#x27;s difficult to see these pictures on a website.</li>
    <li> SPEEDY ARRIVAL AND GREAT PRICE!</li>
    <li> Just the ones I wanted, you haft to be careful what kind of brush heads you use on your electric brush. I always use Braun  heads They seem to last longer than some of the other heads. They shipped them quickly and I am happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Bought the new toothbrush and needed more brushes.  Called the dentist and he said to only use soft brushes.  This is the best price I found.</li>
    <li> love the OEM product. works well and the price was good.&lt;br /&gt;arrived on time and the packaging was in tack.</li>
    <li> Authentic Braun replacement brushes are the real thing. They work just like the real brushes that came with the original electric  tooth brush</li>
    <li> My Braun plug in tooth brush finally became unusable because the rechargeable battery became too weak, so I switched to a Braun toothbrush operated by a AA battery.  Later, I was given another Braun plug in unit which needed a new brush.  That is when I ordered this set of brushes from Amazon.  I was happy to discover that these brushes work with both toothbrushes although they were not advertised as such.  Each of the toothbrushes works very well, and I am glad to be able to use the same model of brushes for each one.</li>
    <li> These brushes are expensive, but are much higher quality and last far longer than generic brushes.  They are well worth the higher price for cleaning your teeth.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s what I use all the time for the last 20 years! A perfect oral health. Tool!</li>
    <li> The Braun Replacement Brushes are the only way to go compared to the shoddy after-market ones I&#x27;ve tried that last about a week.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, at a reasonable price, fast ship, great seller</li>
    <li> The best is the round head.</li>
    <li> I had bought these awhile back and there were 4 in the packet.  THey got lost when we moved and I was happy to find them again but now there are only 3 and no case to keep them.  THey fit perfectly and work well.</li>
    <li> Fits my toothbrush great!  Feels great!  Cleans my teeth well.</li>
    <li> Braun is a great product, and this offer was below retail price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used the first one and it is just as good as rest of Braun products.</li>
    <li> This product meet all my expectations.  It worked great with and I didn&#x27;t have any issues. I would purchase from this company again.</li>
    <li> I ordered a set of three of Braun replacement brushes. It arrived a set of 5 instead. The package says \\&quot;value package\\&quot;. So I guess this is the one of previous promotional packages. The quality is the same as the ones which I had purchased at Costco.So I am very happy with this value package.</li>
    <li> These brushes work well enough, but the heads are noticeably smaller than the ones I buy in the store. They had German written on the packaging. If they are the real thing, they are an older version of the brush heads that have been sitting in a warehouse somewhere.</li>
    <li> Love this tooth brush.  These heads are the perfect size for my mouth.</li>
    <li> Braun soft brushes are hard to find, except on Amazon.  Would not want my supply of them to drop too low as they do need to be tossed when the blue on the bristles lightens to half way down the bristle... or if the bristles spay at the top due to the brushing style.  My last prophylactic dental visit had my dentist amazed that he could barely find plaque on my teeth!</li>
    <li> This product is the perfect fit for my electronic toothbrush. The other ones i had been buying looked like they were fitting but I noticed that when I put the brush against my teeth, they would stop actually vibrating. These ones vibrate all the way and I feel that my teeth are actually clean. I have the Braun Professional Care brush in case anyone is curious. Make sure to check compatibility. It makes a huge difference.</li>
    <li> THESE PRODUCTS WORKED AS NOTED IN THE ADV BLURB. THEY DID A SUPURB JOB AND FUNCTIONED IN THE BRAUN AS THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO FUNCTION.  A FINE PURCHASE.</li>
    <li> A perfect transaction, I rec&#x27;d what I wanted and more. I have an older  (8 or 10 yr) power brush handle. The brushes I bought were exactly the same as original...BUT, the order was filled with packs of five (5) brusches instead of 3 per pack. I bought 2 packs..so my pearly whites will be well taken care of for some time.</li>
    <li> Great brushes. Was buying the cheap ones, and they broke.&lt;br /&gt;Best to spend a little more for the real thing!</li>
    <li> these fit my Braun and work great</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the refill brushes.  Great price as they sell for three times as much at department stores.  Product is exactly like advertised and I received it way earlier then promised.</li>
    <li> Obtaining replacement heads for the Braun toothbrush at a reasonable price is difficult, but these seem to be genuine and very good value for money.  No problems after using them for two weeks.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find these in town at all the local stores. Hated to trash a great toothbrush just because I couldn&#x27;t find any replacement brush heads. The order got here quickly and my smile couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> Braun does not disappoint. Good price for a product that is not easy to find.</li>
    <li> I got these replacement heads for my Braun electric toothbrush.  I got them for a great price!  What a great value.  Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> This was such a good deal on the type of brushes we usually buy that I bought two.  Everything arrived as scheduled and was in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work with my toothbrush....had to return them.  Have already had my&lt;br /&gt;account refunded.  I am very thankful for that.</li>
    <li> I got a much better deal than I thought I would.  We love the toothbrushes.  Thanks!!!!!!  Will order again in a few months..</li>
    <li> Delivery was timely and am satisfied with products.</li>
    <li> These are exact replacements for my Braun Oral-B toothbrush. If you don&#x27;t like the heavy vibration of some electric toothbrushes like me, the Braun is your best choice. These heads fit the handle exactly and are easy to reach hard to access places in your mouth.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. no problem!</li>
    <li> The Braun toothbrushes are excellent they reach into tight places. I would highly recommend this toothbrush. I like the smallness of the head of the toothbrush.</li>
    <li> ...very poorly made.  Save your money and buy Oral B and Braun brushes on Subcribe and Save or add it from that area when you order totals at least $35.00.  I&#x27;ve bought brushes for $6.99 each.</li>
    <li> Had been looking for replacements for my Braun cordless toothbrush.  Hadn&#x27;t realized that Braun and Oral B are compatible.  These were perfect and exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> As with other products, I am often confused by the myriad types of replacement brushes available in stores.  Invariably, there are none that specifically fit my electric toothbrush.  Ordering on line, I found those made for my brush. The shipping was more than I liked, thus the 4 star rating.</li>
    <li> The brushes wear well, but one must buy new ones sometimes.  These were a better buy then in the stores and I appreciate that. Again,  I am happy</li>
    <li> Work as described. They are all holding up well. The bushes clean really well. I would recommend these to all.</li>
    <li> Have purchased before.  Great little tool.</li>
    <li> You just can not beat using the real thing.  Much better price than at my local drug and grocery store.</li>
    <li> They were just what we wanted, and I couldn&#x27;t find these locally. Now we can continue using our great toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t been able to find this item in stores, so glad for Amazon!  Works great on my teeth.  Would recommend these brushes for sure.  Can&#x27;t beat the price too.  Instead of a set of 3, got 5!</li>
    <li> Same Braun quality.  Shipping took a while, but the price was outstanding.  Tried some &amp;#34;knock off&amp;#34; fits Braun brushes from CVS - couldn&#x27;t use the fit was terrible and pinched my mouth.  These work just like the originals.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Price, quality and delivery were very good, thanks.</li>
    <li> The price for these brushes was very comparable to &amp;#34;knock offs&amp;#34;, brand new in the original packaging. I would buy them again.</li>
    <li> These replacements were for my husbands toothbrush and he absolutely loves them. They work every bit as good as the original that came with the toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I would like more if it is on prime</li>
    <li> I received these quickly and they are just like the originals except they have the little color band included which my original did not have.  It sure feels good having a new brush!</li>
    <li> We had previously purchased a different manufacture replacement brushes that did not fit our electric brush. They were loose and fell off during use and may I add more expensive from a local Dept. store. These new ones purchased via the internet fit well, and less expensive. I would recommend these to anyone using the Braun electric tooth brush. We will be purchasing more when needed.</li>
    <li> Great value for the money!  Just what I expected and it came quickly, I will definately purchase again, much better deal than anywhere else I&#x27;ve looked!</li>
    <li> True Braun replacements. Hard to find.</li>
    <li> I was surprised that these replacement tooth brushes seem to  clean better than the original&lt;br /&gt;ones supplied when I bought the electric tooth brush.Was hesitate at first but really like them.</li>
    <li> Just what I ordered,, all three were in fine shape and work on my tooth brush.  I see no reason why the won&#x27;t last a long time.</li>
    <li> Good price for something I use every day.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be back for more one of these days! d</li>
    <li> Hi&lt;br /&gt;When I received the Oral B tooth brushes initial reaction was not good as I thought I got a knock-off. I even wrote to the dealer who was prompt in getting back.&lt;br /&gt;Now, that I&#x27;ve been using for a while, I know by experience its original.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years, and these replacements were top quality. I guess they should be since they are &amp;#34;Braun&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> This was just what I was looking for.  Price was comparable to what I could find locally and saved me a trip.</li>
    <li> If you have a little bunch of heads obvious in the bathroom drawer, maybe, just maybe, you will actually change it more than once a year.  A good thing.</li>
    <li> These replacement brushes may not &#x27;wobble&#x27;, but they are the last thing your gums need! These bristles are supposed to be &#x27;FlexiSoft&#x27;, but they are incredible stiff and extremely harsh and brutal to your gums. These brushes are not good and I am returning them today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that your GUMS are equally as important as your teeth and are, in fact, the foundation for your teeth. You must treat them firmly, but GENTLY because gums  RECEDE with abrasive action, and become less able to support your teeth. I suspect that those who have given these brushes such a good rating are used to ravaging their teeth and gums with overly stiff brush action and assume that if their gums are not bleeding, they are doing a good job and getting their teeth &#x27;clean&#x27; with this overly vigorous action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dentists have ALWAYS recommended a soft bristled brush, so go get the extra soft and do right for your teeth AND GUMS.</li>
    <li> I had looked all over for replacement heads and was so happy to finally find some. I hope they continue to provide these.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.I&#x27;ve been using my Braun for several years.I received my order promptly.&lt;br /&gt;Yes I would recommend this product</li>
    <li> These are the real thing. I have bought knock off brands before, but these are the real thing. Oddly they were on a cut off and stapled cardboard that must have had more on it. But, that doesn&#x27;t bother me, but it may others. The brushes are always way over priced everywhere (just like printer ink) so I have to keep watch on getting them with some value priced. These do that, job done.</li>
    <li> Brushes work well and was a good price when I purchased them..At the time I did receive extra brush with them.</li>
    <li> Just as expected, actually the package I received had 4 brushes so it was an even better value!  Will order again.</li>
    <li> Works great, good price, came on time.</li>
    <li> These really clean my teeth and are long lasting to boot. I have used my first one for about 5 weeks using my own mixture of toothpowder and still no wear.</li>
    <li> The new Braun Vitality toothbrush I just bought has different style brushes. I wonder whether the more solid-blue heads I received are an older style?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s little glamor in toothbrush heads, so it&#x27;s hard to get excited about this product. It is, however, the first time in a long while that I have purchased the brand name instead of the generic type, and I am curious to see how the durability differs.</li>
    <li> No problems.&lt;br /&gt;Shipped quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Came as ordered.&lt;br /&gt;I have nothing more to say although this review requires 16 words or more.</li>
    <li> These fit perfect and are a fraction of the price for the original, they arrived fast and packaging was good, great service.</li>
    <li> The brushes were better than described.  They seen strong and durable.  I will order them again when they wear out.</li>
    <li> I hesitate to give brushes a five. That is the only reason I did not. These brushes seem to work as well as the ones that were much higher priced at the store.</li>
    <li> These brushes are very hard and don&#x27;t fit the Braun toothbrush snug so I am not happy with them.  I guess that&#x27;s why they normally cost around $20.</li>
    <li> The price was good on these and they arrived promptly. They are stiffer than the ones that came with the toothbrush, but for the price difference I can live with it.</li>
    <li> Excellent delivery and product!</li>
    <li> Some say they are hard. They are for the first use, but I tend to like harder bristle brushes. If your gums are extra sensitive, these are for you. They are the only ones I can find for my particular brand. Work great though!</li>
    <li> Perfect, good price and work very well. Have been looking for replacements for a while but drugstores are very expensive.</li>
    <li> works just fine on my toothbrush.  It could fit a little more tightly.  No complaints.  Will order again when needed.</li>
    <li> Brushes are genuine Braun Repl. Brushes. The work well on my Braun tooth brush. The package was a special pack with extre tooth brush.</li>
    <li> Seemed like authentic Braun which makes a huge difference!  Price was fair for authentic, but I wish it was a 4 pack instead of a 3 pack.</li>
    <li> I forgot how bird the name brand ones are, after using generic for a long time. These are great &amp; much cheaper than in stores. I will order again. They came quickly, too. Thanks.</li>
    <li> My order arrived when expected and in excellent condition. They perform as expected.  They are heads for an electric toothbrush that I could not find in stores anywhere in the Kansas City area.  It is nice to be able to get what you want even when local merchants do not carry the item any more.</li>
    <li> was cheaper then walmart. have used this for years and it does a great job with little effort of brushing.</li>
    <li> Genuine Braun toothbrushes are far superior to their cheaper imitators which I have used in the past.  Purchase Braun and leave the rest behind.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read the reviews of the cheap knockoffs. These are the Braun product, and they work just as well as the originals. I&#x27;ve had my Braun electric toothbrush, model &amp;#34;Plaque Remover 3D Action,&amp;#34; for at least a dozen years now, and it is still going strong. So, another superior product from Braun.</li>
    <li> good bristles - doing a good job- (but too soon to judge their longevity), good buy for a more than reasonable price</li>
    <li> It is hard to find replacement brushes for the Oral B that are reasonable pricewise.  These were the least expensive and they are so much better than the generic brushes.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Braun toothbrush for years and these were replacement brushes.  My dentist tells me my home care is&lt;br /&gt;excellent and I believe these implements can take some credit.</li>
    <li> Excellent value for the money, quick shipping and works fine on the tooth brush head. Beats those costly replacement brushes at other stores. They are very expensive!</li>
