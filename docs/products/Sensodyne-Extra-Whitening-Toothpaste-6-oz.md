      <li>but it didn&#x27;t make much difference.</li>

      <li>guess certain people may be reactive to the ingredients to the \\&quot;extra whitening\\&quot; brand.</li>
      <li>As soon as I switched to Sensodyne the sensitivity have disappeared completely.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Sensodyne can be used as a \\&quot;stand-alone\\&quot; toothpaste, since it has fluoride in it, or it can be used just for sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am a dentist who recommends Sensodyne toothpaste for my patients with sensitive teeth.</li>

      <li>It did come back fairly quickly however, not NEAR as severely, but an additional application solved it, and for a longer period, until the Advil kicked in.  </li>
      <li>But it takes a long time with this as the product works very gradually.  </li>
      <li>I had bought Sensodyne about a week earlier and used it like a normal toothpaste</li>
      <li>I did go on a vacation and forgot to bring my toothpaste, so I settled for a more common brand and after a week I felt some of the sensitivity coming back -</li>
      <li>If you brush electric, move the brush head very slowly and it woks much better.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been brushing with it for over a year with very good results - I still don&#x27;t care for ice cream, but cold drinks no longer send chills down my spine</li>
      <li>Tom&#x27;s of Maine Toothpaste, Sensitive, Wintermint, 4 oz]], and that finally relieved my pain and sensitivity.</li>
      <li>I honestly thought there was something really wrong with my teeth-</li>
      <li>/&gt;After just a few days of rubbing this paste on the sensitive tooth, my problem completely disappeared and I have not had any problems since!  </li>

<li> /&gt;After just a few days of rubbing this paste on the sensitive tooth, my problem completely disappeared and I have not had any problems since!  </li>
<li> A few months ago, I awoke one morning with a very sensitive upper front tooth.  </li>
<li> my tooth was about 50% as sensitive as it was before the root canal - so in my opinion not a success.  </li>
<li> My teeth were so sensitive to sour taste I could not eat an apple.</li>

<li> As long as you&#x27;re brushing, you may as well whiten and get rid of those coffee stains!  </li>
<li> sure however, that whatever sensitivity-relieving product you purchase (whether Sensodyne or others) contains the active ingredient Potassium Nitrate (5%), which will fill in the areas in the tooth that are exposed to the cold elements.</li>
<li> Be careful, Sensodyne does come in a gell.  </li>

<li> This one takes away the sensitivity I was noticing with my other whitening toothpaste.  </li>
<li> Hot, cold, hard, soft everything!</li>
<li> /&gt;The active ingredient in any toothpaste that is advertized as a \\&quot;desensitizing toothpaste\\&quot; is potassium nitrate.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve never suffered from tooth sensitivity when eating hot or cold foods</li>
<li> it just needs a little help in that department.  </li>
<li> /&gt;I was puzzled by this, as I had never had trouble with teeth sensitivity before, but on the advice of my Dad (a dentist)</li>
<li> sceptical about something with such cheesy advertising</li>
<li> If the tubules are touched, exposed to sugar, or cold, fluid moves in the tubule and this is perceived as pain.</li>
<li> Just enough to irritate me when eating cold foods.</li>
<li> yeah, I was desperate.  </li>
<li> Before I used Sensodyne, I felt pain when I drank something cold.</li>
<li> Each time a cold substance (even a rush of air) passed over that tooth, it would send a jolt of pain through my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not that it tastes bad -</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The toothpaste is as effective as claimed. My teeth were so sensitive to sour taste I could not eat an apple. As soon as I switched to Sensodyne the sensitivity have disappeared completely.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is the best I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year now. Noticeable difference in whitening after I brush.</li>
    <li> I had a root canal just over a year ago.  The dentist warned me that sometimes they don&#x27;t \\&quot;take\\&quot; and they have to be done again (which is why the insurance company made me go to a specialist instead of my regular dentist).  Well, it didn&#x27;t fully take - meaning, after about a month my tooth was about 50% as sensitive as it was before the root canal - so in my opinion not a success.  The dentist looked at it and said everything is closed up, and he couldn&#x27;t see any signs of infection or swelling, so I figured I&#x27;d give Sensodyne a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for close to a year now and I haven&#x27;t felt any sensitivity to my tooth since.  In fact my whole mouth feels better.  I did go on a vacation and forgot to bring my toothpaste, so I settled for a more common brand and after a week I felt some of the sensitivity coming back - so I KNOW this stuff is the reason why I feel great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one and only negative part of the review is mostly minor....it doesn&#x27;t do a great job at freshening your breath like other toothpastes do.  I really need to use mouthwash before hand, or I&#x27;ll need to take a breath mint in the car on the way to work.  It&#x27;s not that it tastes bad - it tastes good actually - it just needs a little help in that department.  It does NOT take away from the whole point of why someone should use this toothpaste though.  I highly recommend it to everyone who has any sensitivity issues with their teeth and gums.  Give it a week or two and you&#x27;ll notice differences already.</li>
    <li> Recently I realized I have a large cavity in my upper right wisdom tooth and the pain has been almost unbearable. I tried pain pills and even popular OTC&#x27;s that numb tooth pain but none of it worked.     I had bought Sensodyne about a week earlier and used it like a normal toothpaste but it didn&#x27;t make much difference. Out of desperation I tried something different. I took the Sensodyne, placed a little of it on the tip of my tongue, and then directly put it in the cavity on my tooth. Within 30 seconds there was no pain at all!     I&#x27;m so grateful for the pain to be gone that I wrote this review right after it happened. It really is a miracle cure for people in my situation. I&#x27;m still going to get my wisdom tooth pulled in the future but Sensodyne will allow me to live a normal life until then. Thanks to the company that made this awesome product.</li>
    <li> have reviewed several times great stuff</li>
    <li> The dentist suggested that my husband start using.  I kept on with my regular toothpast (Crest).  I used his when I ran out.  Started using his.  Has a great taste.</li>
    <li> I woke up around 4am with SEVERE tooth pain, so I went and bought some Ibuprofen and saw the \\&quot;Sensodyne\\&quot; tooth paste, so I bought it as well, if not as an act of desperation...yeah, I was desperate.  Went home, took the Ibuprofen, and bushed the area specifically that hurt, and the pain disappeared, IMMEDIATELY.  It did come back fairly quickly however, not NEAR as severely, but an additional application solved it, and for a longer period, until the Advil kicked in.  It was a life saver, and I continue to use it with periodic Advil dosages, but only 2 maybe twice a day.  My mouth feels MUCH better.  This stuff actually WORKS.  Really, it&#x27;s quite remarkable.  I expected it to be a mouth numbing experience, but it is NOT.  No numbing, no weird taste, no tingling...no PAIN.</li>
    <li> This is a great whitening toothpaste.  It works for me as well as Rembrandt.  This one takes away the sensitivity I was noticing with my other whitening toothpaste.  It also tastes good.  I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> I am a dentist who recommends Sensodyne toothpaste for my patients with sensitive teeth. I give it 5-stars because it has a proven track-record of many years of effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The active ingredient in any toothpaste that is advertized as a \\&quot;desensitizing toothpaste\\&quot; is potassium nitrate. Potassium nitrate works by plugging the micro dentinal tubules that communicate directly with the pulp (nerve center) of the tooth. Most people have sensitive teeth because of gum recession exposing the root surface, (or thinning enamel) thus exposing the dentinal tubules. If the tubules are touched, exposed to sugar, or cold, fluid moves in the tubule and this is perceived as pain. With repeated exposure, potassium nitrate effectively plugs up the dentinal tubules to lessen or completely eliminate sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothpaste will not work on teeth with cavities, or teeth with abscesses - it only works on teeth with exposed dentinal tubules.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also important to realize that Sensodyne does not work immediately. It takes up to 2-4 weeks of continuous daily exposure for the product to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sensodyne can be used as a \\&quot;stand-alone\\&quot; toothpaste, since it has fluoride in it, or it can be used just for sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the effect of the potassium nitrate will wear off over time, so it is likely one will need to repeat the treatment as sensitivity returns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product for those with sensitive teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Jim Koenig, DDS</li>
    <li> Sensodyne Toothpaste / B000FKHT0E&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have really sensitive teeth. I have to use drinking straws when my drink has ice in it, I shudder when I see someone bit into an ice cream cone. My dentist recommended Sensodyne and I will now never use anything else. I&#x27;ve been brushing with it for over a year with very good results - I still don&#x27;t care for ice cream, but cold drinks no longer send chills down my spine and I don&#x27;t have to go without liquids if the restaurant doesn&#x27;t provide drinking straws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Ana Mardoll</li>
    <li> I like this toothpaste.  It has reduced my tooth sensitivity and it is an actual paste, not a gell.  I do not like those minty gells so many have changed to.  Be careful, Sensodyne does come in a gell.  I have purchased some by mistake.</li>
    <li> Rather than alleviating my sensitivity, Sensodyne severely aggravated it. Before I used Sensodyne, I felt pain when I drank something cold. After I used Sensodyne, I felt pain all the time. It was *excruciating*. I switched to [[ASIN:B0000535RQ Tom&#x27;s of Maine Toothpaste, Sensitive, Wintermint, 4 oz]], and that finally relieved my pain and sensitivity. Not only do the Tom&#x27;s of Maine products work, they are also all cruelty free (no animal testing, ever).</li>
    <li> As long as you&#x27;re brushing, you may as well whiten and get rid of those coffee stains!  But it takes a long time with this as the product works very gradually.  You will be rewarded if you are persistent and consistent.  If you brush electric, move the brush head very slowly and it woks much better.</li>
    <li> I used this for severe bouts of pain lasting about 5-10 minutes- a pain that really had me doubled up. Cause was chewing something the &amp;#34;wrong way&amp;#34; or apple or acidic grapefruit juice.&lt;br /&gt;Was sceptical about something with such cheesy advertising but the relief was very quick. Still getting mild sensitivity symptoms but very pleased that the severe nerve type pain has gone.</li>
    <li> A few months ago, I awoke one morning with a very sensitive upper front tooth.  Each time a cold substance (even a rush of air) passed over that tooth, it would send a jolt of pain through my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was puzzled by this, as I had never had trouble with teeth sensitivity before, but on the advice of my Dad (a dentist) I purchased this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After just a few days of rubbing this paste on the sensitive tooth, my problem completely disappeared and I have not had any problems since!  I now alternate brushing with this product and a better-tasting paste (the chalky taste is the one downside of Sensodyne) and that system seems to prevent any sensitivity from developing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure however, that whatever sensitivity-relieving product you purchase (whether Sensodyne or others) contains the active ingredient Potassium Nitrate (5%), which will fill in the areas in the tooth that are exposed to the cold elements.</li>
    <li> I use to suffer from mild sensitivity. Just enough to irritate me when eating cold foods. So, I switched to Sensodyne in May. Since then my teeth are sensitive to everything! Hot, cold, hard, soft everything! It comes on suddenly and lingers. I don&#x27;t know which ingredient is causing this but it should be removed!</li>
    <li> This is a great toothpaste, I got 3 tubes with my order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and upon using for 1 week, I felt my teeth were stronger, upon using all 3 tubes. I felt my teeth were 10x stronger than normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was great, No longer did I get pain from eating, and on top of it all my teeth actually got alot whiter.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s almost incredible how well this toothpaste works. I had a cavity filled a few months back, and ever since that tooth has been super sensitive. I honestly didn&#x27;t expect this toothpaste to do much, but it worked after about a day. Every now and then I try to switch to a different toothpaste, but the sensitivity comes back almost right away. Another review has said that this won&#x27;t work on cavities--well, placebo effect or not, it works. This is a great product.</li>
    <li> I grind my teeth at night and this has caused some wear on my teeth so in general, the back of my top teeth tends to be really sensitive. This is especially noticeable when I use whitestrips, the back of my top teeth can become unbearable when I use them as directed, whereas the rest of my teeth are fine.  Using this has helped minimize some of that discomfort, I rarely experience sensitivity anymore.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for close to a year, at the recommendation of my dentist because my teeth are not my strongest point, even though I&#x27;ve observed good dental practice during my entire life. My dentist said to wait half an hour after eating, to make sure that the acid in the food doesn&#x27;t get rubbed into the teeth by the brushing. During the time I&#x27;ve used this product, my teeth have become more and more fragile and pieces have started to break off with virtually no provocation. I am considering simply going back to regular toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I love Sensodyne!  I&#x27;ve been using it for six years per the advice of my dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the \\&quot;extra whitening\\&quot; brand caused even more sensitivity.  Once I switched back to their standard brand, my sensitivity almost vanished immediately.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a coincidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess certain people may be reactive to the ingredients to the \\&quot;extra whitening\\&quot; brand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for about 6 weeks now. I&#x27;ve never suffered from tooth sensitivity when eating hot or cold foods but recently I have suffered severe sensitivity. My hygienist recommended that I use Sensodyne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just Google \\&quot;Sensodyne increased sensitivity\\&quot; and see what comes up. I honestly thought there was something really wrong with my teeth- but I brush and floss regularly and use mouthwash. Apparently when you stop using it your sensitivity increases hugely. So I&#x27;m not looking forward to weening myself off this chemical. But today it was honestly sore to breathe through my mouth as the cold air was causing me to wince in pain. I repeat- I never suffered ANY sensitivity before using this toothpaste!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would really recommend that you avoid this toothpaste.</li>
