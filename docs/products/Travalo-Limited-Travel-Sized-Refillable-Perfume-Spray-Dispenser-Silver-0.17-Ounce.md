<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> for travel or just to carry in your purse for freshening up, this is ideal. no need for expensive small sizes of perfume. just fill it with your favorite and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
    <li> I love being able to have my favorite perfume in an easy to carry, easy to travel format. It&#x27;s a quick way to freshen up when I&#x27;m on the go, and not worry about my expensive perfume being confiscated through the airport.</li>
    <li> Unbelievably easy to use - it does what it&#x27;s suppose to do - refill with a snap - cute/stylish mini atomizer.  No leaks, perfect price point.</li>
    <li> So very easy to use. I love it. I will definitely be buying many more of these little guys. I&#x27;ve tried it r many different travel size atomizers. This is by far the best one I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Love the variety of colors!</li>
    <li> I hate trying to find minis of my favorite fragrances.  This thing is perfect and will be a staple in my purse forever!</li>
    <li> Works great, just what I needed for traveling !</li>
    <li> I have had several of these and they always leak in my purse and some have stopped attaching to the perfume bottle to fill after a couple of times.</li>
    <li> item arrived in good shape and was as advertised.</li>
    <li> Love this product that has definitely solved the issue of my traveling with my favorite cologne due to the size of the bottle and TSA regulations for liquids. I would strongly recommend it .</li>
    <li> This is great for bringing perfume with you on the go. It&#x27;s really simple to fill and my perfume never leaks or evaporates, even after being in the travalo for a month. Love it!</li>
    <li> Perfect companion for traveling.  I travel every week for work and this gives me the  opportunity to carry a cologne with me that does not leak or have quantity TSA issues.&lt;br /&gt;I will probably get one or two more for different fragrances.</li>
    <li> Can not change the type of perfume, otherwise you will mingle smell!</li>
    <li> Very comfortable to travel</li>
    <li> Leaks, only loaded a few times successfully, wasted a bunch of expensive perfume.</li>
    <li> I am very excited. I have a small purse and it fits perfect. Helpful for smokers too, to cover the smell.</li>
    <li> Purchased a few to have extras in my cars. No need to carry bottles anymore just throw them in yourbag.</li>
    <li> Novel pocket perfume dispenser. Perfect. Will buy more as gifts.</li>
    <li> so far so good. was very easy to fill after initial fear...will use again.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to get this. I used it for a trip and all was well. After refilling a second time, the atomizer leaks and doesn&#x27;t spray well. I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Love. Love. Love. Have my favorite perfume with me all of the time. Never leaks. This thing is genius.</li>
    <li> The product is supposed to be compatible with other perfume packages, but I have tried it with several different brands and have no luck.</li>
    <li> I bought 2, one for me and one for my mom. It is easy to load your favorite scent in the travalo, nothing leaks, it works perfect! It is always in my purse and when I travel, I take it as well. Easy to use and very functional</li>
    <li> Deducting one star because it doesn&#x27;t fit every nozzle. Most, but not all. Otherwise fine product. Have maybe 5? Will probably get more if there are enough different colors.</li>
    <li> Keep this in my bag or my car so i dont have to carry a large cologne bottle around. Easy to fill with no spilling. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This worked perfectly, and it did not leak in my bag:)  I truly appreciated having it on vacation with me!</li>
    <li> Perfect to carrying liquids while traveling or in the field.  I bought this for carrying lens cleaner for my eyeglasses, camera and cell phone, bought another for aftershave.  Easy to fill from any spray bottle and has not leaked.</li>
    <li> It leaks and vaporize. I did buy 30 pieces and nearly 13 pieces leaks very badly. How disappointed that its very poorly manufactured.</li>
    <li> I love those type of perfume atomizer. so easy to refill. just love it. it&#x27;s beautiful and easy to carry. though I found cheaper price in local stores. still very good product.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully !&lt;br /&gt;Use it all time. Doesn&#x27;t leak and I have my favorite perfume with me in my purse everywhere !!! Recommend it</li>
    <li> The container is very easy to use, and very  easy to fill and  it is very convenient.  Not much more to say</li>
    <li> I am so thankful for this product.  I will purchase again ... great value, works wonderfully and no mess. It was super easy to fill with the included instructions.  Took just a few minutes.  Great product!</li>
    <li> These are always a little bit tedious to fill, but they are so handy! I absolutely love this one because I can just pop this one onto the nozzle, so it&#x27;s faster to fill.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I purchased some expensive cologne and wanted to be able to bring it where I went.  It doesn&#x27;t leak, I&#x27;ve carried it in my pocket to multiple tailgates, a few weekend bar trips, slept with it in my pocket after a long night, no leaks.  The sprays from the unit are lighter than the original bottle, but that simply disperses the scent across the body more, no real effect positive or negative.  It held about 15 FULL sprays from my full size bottle and lasts about 60 sprays from the unit I&#x27;d assume as I&#x27;ve never fully emptied it.  I always carry it full.  It&#x27;s sometimes more economical and practical for me to fill the Travalo and use it as my primary spray as I&#x27;ll maybe spray 3 squirts from the full size bottle on my neck and chest, and touch up my wrists using the Travalo later in the night.  It&#x27;s a pretty quality product, about the size of a Bic lighter.  It wouldn&#x27;t be very noticeable in your pocket unless you have a large set of keys, full size lighter, full pack of smokes etc.  I&#x27;m very impressed overall.  I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.  Many late hour compliments while those other guys smell like the dirty crowd!</li>
    <li> Best invention ever! I don&#x27;t have to travel with my big bottle of perfume anymore, and I can get more than one fragrance if I want.</li>
    <li> No spills, was able to fill it immediately after opening the packaging. No problems filling it and will definitely get one for friends and family. It also sprays out a nice fine mist, so I am happy!</li>
    <li> Really love being able to travel with my favorite perfumes. Had no idea this item existed. Works as described! Will be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> Excellent seller.. Quick delivery, Great product&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> Leaks terribly. Wasted a lot of very expensive cologne.</li>
    <li> It feels real cheap.. its confusing and really really small, doesn&#x27;t hold a lot of perfume. But i do like it for traveling.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t want to travel with perfume bottles, here is your answer. TSA-compliant, small, easy to use. A great system and a wonderful way to make your luggage or handbag that much lighter. I use it even if checking luggage. Also unmarked re: contents, hence less attractive to steal.</li>
    <li> No expectations were met with this item.  I&#x27;m sure it sprays...its 2014, we should be getting THAT right.  However, in my attempt to fill it using its patented new fandangled filling system....it failed on every bottle of cologne and perfume my wife and I have.  It just doesn&#x27;t work....or at least....my bottle didn&#x27;t.  YMMV</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed. I used this on one trip, and it worked fine. Filling it up for my second trip, it only filled halfway, and trying to add any more would cause it to draining the excess from the bottom. Total waste.</li>
    <li> I just love these for travel or in my purse. So far they have lasted well</li>
    <li> Travalos are so easy to use, and they&#x27;re great for travel. I always have one with me in my purse. I love being able to freshen up with a spritz whenever I want.</li>
    <li> I keep this in my 100+ degree vehicle in south TX, and this item doesn&#x27;t leak and still works like new!</li>
    <li> I would never buy a scent and not have a travalo to put in some of it to carry with me. It is a GREAT product! I have several, one for every perfume I wear. Men or woman you need this product! It does not leak it is easy to fill and I can&#x27;t say enough about it.</li>
    <li> Works as expected. Easy to transfer from full-size cologne bottles. I wish bottom had more flat surface for stand up stability</li>
    <li> Great product and good for travel. Fast shipment and easy to install with out any leak. Thank you and will order again :-)</li>
    <li> Excellent product and a great price.&lt;br /&gt;The shape is beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;I bought two and I&#x27;ll buy them again.&lt;br /&gt;Possible provided that gift.</li>
    <li> Been a few weeks and it working great so far. Only time will tell (and I&#x27;ll update if required) if it starts leaking.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s expensive but we&#x27;re able to connect the base to the existing bottles of perfumes and push down about 10 times to fill up this up. My wife loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple, connect the base to this bottle to the top (remove the sprayer first) of the perfume bottle, pump down 10 times and you&#x27;re done.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with this perfect product,  elegant design and easy to refill. Perfect for travel, car, office and you can take it everywhere. I will order another gift for my friends. strongly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The concept is genius, but the inner vial is made of a polypropylene (PP) soft cloudy plastic (think a gallon of milk jug), which absorbs odors/scents over time. This means 2 things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-this type of plastic will absorb your fragrance over time, which means if you fill it with a second fragrance, its scent will be altered. Meaning, you&#x27;ll smell remnants of the first fragrance. Ick.&lt;br /&gt;-because of this, if you have several fragrances, it&#x27;s best to buy one Travalo per fragrance and keep them consistent. Don&#x27;t mix and match.</li>
    <li> I am a HUGE perfume person, and am constantly frustrated that many of my favorite scents do not come in travel sizes, and if they do, they cost almost as much as the full size bottle. I bought this after reading so many good reviews, and it did not disappoint. It was super easy to use, and it does not leak. I not only bought two more for myself, but I bought all the girls in my office department one too. It&#x27;s definitely worth it, especially if you love having portable scents.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I&#x27;m kicking myself for not buying it sooner. No more paying for pricey travel bottles of perfume. Very easy to use and refill with no leaking or mess. Perfectly sized to fit in a purse pocket, suitcase, car, etc. These would be great as gifts for men &amp; women alike. Great buy!</li>
    <li> I use this for cologne and it is awkward carrying something with a girl design on it everyday but other people hardly ever see it. The important thing is that it&#x27;s so easy to use and will never leak. I carry this on me in the sun and everywhere and the cologne scent does not get affected. No leaks to report at all. Still looks awful but as long as I smell great I will live with it.</li>
    <li> Easy to fill and no leaks thus far.  I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now and so far no issues.  This is a great alternative to carrying around entire bottles of cologne, especially when traveling.  I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is one of the most useful cheap things I have purchased online. I was always carrying heavy perfume bottles in my purse. Now I carry this little bottle and once is empty I go and refill it from my bigger perfume bottles.&lt;br /&gt;I bought all different colors for my favorite fragances I own so I don&#x27;t get confused which one I want to put in my purse today</li>
    <li> You are the best always</li>
    <li> Perfect for taking your colognes with you around the world.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before, and I am purchasing it as a gift for my sister.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had my  own Travalo for a couple of years and it is still working well.&lt;br /&gt;I like the product because I bought a very large bottle of my favorite perfume.&lt;br /&gt;Now I can carry this perfume with me because of the convenient size dispenser.</li>
    <li> Conveniently sized, easy to refill, no mess or leaking - perfect for travel! I also appreciate the clear casing to see the amount.</li>
    <li> Recommend the travalo perfume bottles to anyone who wants to have an easy experience of refilling from larger bottles.  The design is classy and available in a variety of colors.</li>
    <li> I ordered two of these travel perfume bottles. I intentionally ordered this model, the newer model, because I liked the clear base. I received two of the old model. They will probably work for my purpose but they were not what I ordered. Not really worth returning for this price. Not really worth the hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware if you want the newer model. You may get the old model which is not pictured and is mostly solid in color.</li>
    <li> This is a great tool to help with your travel needs. I dont always want to lug around a huge bottle of perfume so it&#x27;s great. I also have a bottle of perfume that has a leaky top, so the Travalo is perfect for allowing me to pump the perfume inot a new container and still be able to use the perfume without the leakage!</li>
    <li> it was hard to fill in fact i could not get it full and the little i did get in it leaked out</li>
    <li> You have your favorite cologne when in a short trip,, even a week.&lt;br /&gt;You can have it permanently  in your pocket.</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my Vince Camuto perfume. I read reviews regarding size and it fit perfectly onto my perfume bottle nozzle. Also, there was a little spill of perfume outside of bottle after filling, but since, traveling in purse, I have no leaks. I love this product and being able to have something small to freshen up in the afternoons at work.</li>
    <li> These are great little vials to take perfume on the go! The only problem is, once you put perfume in them, you&#x27;re stuck with that perfume in them until you use the perfume up. Even when you use the perfume up, the inside of the Travalo smells like that, and so you&#x27;ll be mixing your perfumes. If that&#x27;s ok with you, all the more power to you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a great and easy way overall to bring your favorite scent with you for freshening up or for a night out, or day at work.</li>
    <li> This little guy is such a wonderful companion - I keep it with me in my purse and use it as needed. Wish I had bought one years ago!</li>
    <li> Love this item and it works perfectly. Just right for air travel and no more high priced travel size perfumes to have to deal with.</li>
    <li> Work as advertised at a great price.</li>
    <li> I do not want her return&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;please</li>
    <li> With the current and probably long-term 100ml liquid restriction in place for carry-on luggage, this is an excellent product for air travellers. It&#x27;s called the &#x60;Travalo&#x27; and is a small, tough refillable spray container for perfume, aftershave etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturer claims the device has a regulator which adjusts to the variable air pressure during flights (passenger cabins on commercial airliners are usually pressurised to 7,000 ft. elevation or thereabouts). It is leak-proof, robust, convenient and cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s available in different colours so you can carry more than one and easily identify the content of each. You can obviously use it anywhere, not just in-flight. It&#x27;s very convenient and as a design, hard to fault.</li>
    <li> The perfume smell changes with time. I dont know if there is a problem with the way it holds air, but my Issey Miyaki perfume did not smell the same as when it comes out of the bottle. Kind of a waste because that is the main one I wanted to use this one for because I buy large bottles of it. Not the best for more than 1 or 2 day storage. Was hoping to load the travalo atomizer and have the smell of my perfume not change in 4 to 5 days.</li>
    <li> This parfum Spray looks great and is so good idea to carry al the parfum over the day... simply lovely</li>
    <li> I used this atomizer when I am traveling on planes. It holds enough after shave for 10 days.&lt;br /&gt;It can be put in your carry-on with no problem from TSA.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  No leaks at all.  I bought this one for myself and the solid black version for my husband, as we do not check our bags when traveling.  Great product.</li>
    <li> BUY THIS NOW!! No really, just click &amp;#34;add to cart&amp;#34; and buy it. There are other similar and cheaper versions available (that will leak in your luggage -- ask me how I know), but this one actually works as advertised. Now I can take my favorite perfume when traveling and have total confidence that it won&#x27;t leak mid-flight. Only one consideration -- you need to fill it with a pump-action spritzer perfume. So it won&#x27;t work with dab-on dispensers.</li>
    <li> This is the 4th one I have bought.  I keep giving them as gifts.  People see me using it and want one.</li>
    <li> this product works as long as the small rubber grommet on the bottom of the travalo does not fall out. without the rubber grommet on the bottom of the travalo, cologne is not properly injected into the travalo and just dribbles away at the bottom of the travalo. i would have thought they would have glued the rubber grommet in or done something to prevent it from falling out so easily because without it, it is impossible to refill the travalo. even taking your time to make sure that the perfume nozzle is perfectly lined up with the rubber grommet on the bottom of the travalo does not help as the grommet eventually falls out; hopefully somewhere you can see because the grommet is the size of a lentil and clear making it very hard to keep track of. took me about 30 minutes to fill taking time to reseat the rubber grommet on the bottom between each cologne pump and search for the rubber grommet when it did fall out. great idea but very poor execution i would not recommend buying at all until these problems are corrected.</li>
    <li> the product is good looking and works as advertised.  I gave 3 as gifts.  The people were impressed and excited to receive the gifts</li>
    <li> I know several reviews complained about this leaking. I have had it over two months now and have traveled by air and car with it and have not had any leaking problems. I only fill it half way, which is several weeks of once daily perfume application for me. This has been perfect for travel, whether I&#x27;m away for a few weeks or overnight. I love it and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome!  Highly recommend if you want to travel and wear your regular perfume.</li>
    <li> couple of months i ordered the exact same dispenser that came with the lovely decoration on it, and i ordered it again but this time they brought me the cheap looking one with a red thingy from the end that look NOTHING like the one they are advertising. Even the mechanism in this one looks cheap and weak not like the one they are saying they are selling. DISAPPOINTED.</li>
    <li> The item I received is not what is pictured. It is has a silver cap and clear bottle, but does not have the swirls printed on the bottle. I thought the design was cute and that&#x27;s why I bought from this seller. Also the bottom cap is red, not as pictured and definitely does not look as nice as the one pictured.</li>
    <li> Love, Love Love this product! Now I don&#x27;t have to pay excessive prices for my favorite perfume in tiny bottles for travel and double zip lock them and hope they don&#x27;t leak! This amazing product just slips on the stem of any perfume bottle and with a couple of quick pumps it is full and ready for your purse, suitcase, the car, the office...or anywhere else. The clear body let&#x27;s you see when you are getting low and need to refill it.  I even ordered a couple of these for my husband&#x27;s colonge for travel and the office as well as for Christmas gifts for my girlfriends. Thank you Travalo for a wonderful product!  Now could you make a longer one for hairspray for our purse???</li>
    <li> This product leaks... avoid it!</li>
    <li> This is the perfect size for travel and to drop into my evening bag. Very easy to fill - just took the sprayer off my perfume bottle and pressed this on to the sprayer a few times to fill. I&#x27;m ordering a few to use with the rest of my perfumes.</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed!  I wanted to decant some perfume to share and this brand was recommended.  I followed the directions as to how to pump the perfume from the perfume bottle into the Travalo atomizer, but all I succeeded in doing was waste expensive perfume as it dripped down the perfume bottle&#x27;s side or was sprayed at me rather than in the atomizer.  I would not recommend this brand&#x27;s atomizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After trying to get the second of the two Travalos I ordered to work, I finally managed it.  The connection between the perfume nozzle and the Travalo end has to fit exactly into each other.  I still got some excess spray coming from the perfume bottle, but I filled the Travalo.  I changed my review to 3 stars because if you can get the atomizer to fill, it&#x27;s a neat product.  However, it&#x27;s too fiddly for my liking and will be searching for a similar product by a different brand.</li>
    <li> This is not a very versatile product.  I purchased this container so I could travel with a small container of my perfume.&lt;br /&gt;I have now tried to fill the container from 6 of my perfume bottles--none work as the two dispenser tubes are the same size, so&lt;br /&gt;no delivery of product--no ability to pump the perfume from one vial to another&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware...this is not a very versatile product!</li>
    <li> It leaked even though it promised it wouldn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Handy.  Worked well.  Held plenty for perfume for a 2 week trip.</li>
    <li> I thought these are great. Don&#x27;t leak, carry alot, easy to load and use and great for travel or just to carry in your purse if you forgot to do a morning spritz. I previously recommended this to people, but then noticed if you leave the perfume in there, it changes consistency and even though I don&#x27;t think it leaked, where did the perfume go to? Did it evaporate? I used this only a few times and had the dispenser filled to the top. Where did it all go?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve confirmed that mine leaks. Today, when I took the top off I noticed the spray head was wet with a leak coming from the nozzle. I keep it in a messenger bag that gets moved around throughout the day. I had suspected it leaked because the amount of fragrance inside seemed to go down quicker than I was using it. It&#x27;s a shame because the refill system works well. I don&#x27;t know if mine was a lemon or what, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it with any expensive fragrances you wouldn&#x27;t want to waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After contacting Travalo, they offered to exchange my leaky atomizer. The one they sent is a different model (the one that is all black with a window to see the fragrance inside, might be the Classic) and it doesn&#x27;t leak. Perhaps the one I had was defective or a fake, but at least I know now Travalo does make atomizers that do not leak.</li>
    <li> Love this .., now I can take my favorite fragrances with me when I travel without hassles. Easy to use and refill!</li>
    <li> This is so amazing for transporting perfume, especially if you are like me, and purchase perfume in large bottles not suitable for travel.  It is easy to refill.  So far, I am very very pleased.</li>
    <li> Easy to refill. Works great</li>
    <li> I travel all the time and this is a great way to be able to pack perfume.  Also just a great product to keep in your purse, desk or car.  Easy to use and quality product.</li>
    <li> just what you need for taking your favorite perfume on a trip.</li>
    <li> This is my second, one, I need to take my Amouage colognes on airline luggage with me, and neither one leaks, and I like the clear design,  you can see the contents easily, and it fills in a snap, from both sizes of spray heights that they use.  I will purchase more, as needed.</li>
    <li> easy to fill and work great</li>
    <li> I am back to order another - it is great so far no leaking and adorable. Easy to fill. Sprays fine.</li>
    <li> This is the kind of product that makes you say &amp;#34;gosh, why didn&#x27;t they come out with this sooner?&amp;#34;  It&#x27;s a wonderful little gadget that lets me take my perfume with me on planes without having to worry about schlepping a big bottle or having TSA confiscate it.  It doesn&#x27;t leak, it&#x27;s small and I have no complaints!</li>
    <li> Very good quality, easy to use, I like it ^_^</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t get it to load.</li>
    <li> Bought this because it is the only way to bring perfume or cologne on to your flights without being thrown out by TSA Airport Security.  It is easy to refill and fits easily in your bag, pocket, or purse.</li>
    <li> Handy and cute. Leaked just a tiny bit in purse and evaporated before I finished using the perfume. So, good idea, worked well, just don&#x27;t fill it up. Add only a small amount.</li>
    <li> The container leaked after only half a dozen uses. Very poor quality.</li>
    <li> Great product, i put it inside my car</li>
    <li> Love Love Love these handy, dandy travel fragrance vials. With the amount of traveling I do, for work as well as pleasure, these allow me to take along all my favorites. The product line I wear is customizable and designed for layering, so these are the perfect item to bring them together for a long vacation or short business trip. As bonus points, I get to take my favorites with no risk of broken glass, and no significant added luggage weight! Great for cosmetic bag/purse for daily use too!! I have three of them, and I&#x27;m positive I don&#x27;t have enough!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow Up: A potential buyer asked if they were plastic; Yes, they are plastic; there is no smell and no effect to the fragrance. You can use these with great confidence.</li>
    <li> Ok, I don’t actually carry a purse, I carry a book bag at work. Ladies, ever carry that bottle that leaks or spills in your bag? My body spray would do that, and while the book bag smelled nice, it was a waste. The little travel container is easy to fill, and DOES NOT leak…at all. I even ran it though the washer by accident, and still no leak. I’m going to order another one. LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> I liked this product so much I ordered 6 more for my daughter in laws and friends. I ordered them in different colors.</li>
