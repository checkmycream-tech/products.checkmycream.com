<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Heats up fast and stays hot, works really well</li>
    <li> I was really excited to get these rollers because I recently got back into rolling my hair. I know BaByliss is a reputable brand, and I figured the bad reviews were flukes. I received these today (Sunday), and immediately opened them up to try them. Turned on and rolled my entire head, waited 45 minutes and took down. Nothing. Curl was nonexistant. I looked on the heating base and saw there is a standby option and chalked up the first try as user error. I switched the base over to &amp;#34;in use&amp;#34; and waited an hour for the base to heat completely before rolling my hair again. Rolled my hair AGAIN, waited a hour. Took everything down and nothing. Curl disappeared within 5 minutes of being off the rollers. The rollers are plastic with no metal interior post to hold the heat from the base. Returning as soon as UPS opens tomorrow. DO NOT PURCHASE THESE ROLLERS!</li>
    <li> Love the BaByliss curler sets...they get hot (this one has adjustable heat settings which is nice for thinner hair like mine)  Holds the curl great!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife. She used it one morning. By noon, I couldn&#x27;t even tell that she&#x27;d curled her hair. She liked the look and variety of the set. But, it just didn&#x27;t work well.</li>
    <li> Believe me, I researched a long time before purchasing these rollers. They are quite pricey, but I could not find the sizes I needed in any other single set. And the reviews were good. I could not be more pleased. I was previously using a combination of my old, heavy plastic tabbed hot rollers from the 80&#x27;s and a new, light, flocked set in order to get all the correct sizes, but still I was always a couple of rollers short. This set has all the sizes I need (large and jumbo) and more than enough of them, plus extra sizes if I want to alter my &#x27;do some day. And the main advantage is that they combine the best features of both of my previous sets. They are light like the flocked rollers, but have the hard plastic bump style that I find easier to get securely seated. I prefer the wire clips of my old set to the butterfly style that came with this set, so I am using my old clips and ordering a few replacement clips to supplement. The only cons I can come up with for this set are (1)the size -- too large to leave on a small bathroom counter &amp; even usually have to clear off a spot before using them and (2)can&#x27;t figure out the \\&quot;in use\\&quot; vs \\&quot;standby\\&quot; buttons. The instructions don&#x27;t mention the \\&quot;standby\\&quot; option! I think I need to do a little more investigation. Meanwhile, these are definitely being used with awesome effect in my fine, medium length hair. They heat up fast, and I usually start removing them almost immediately after placing the last roller in. This makes them faster than trying to style with a hairdryer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later note: After several months of use, I maybe have some insight into the \\&quot;in use\\&quot; and \\&quot;standby\\&quot; settings. The instructions, though in about 15 languages, were essentially useless, saying basically, don&#x27;t use while in the tub. There was a sticker on the lid that said to keep the lid closed while heating, which is helpful. With the lid on and set at \\&quot;in use\\&quot;, the rollers heat within a couple of minutes. If you wait longer to use the rollers, they will be VERY HOT -- too hot to handle, really. The \\&quot;standby\\&quot; setting seems to heat much more slowly, so if you want to plug the rollers in and wait 20 minutes, you might want to use that setting. Also, if you are taking a while to put the rollers in, you might want to switch from \\&quot;in use\\&quot; to \\&quot;standby\\&quot; to keep them from getting too hot. I mostly just use \\&quot;in use\\&quot;. I plug them in for 2 or 3 minutes, put them in my hair quickly, remove them quickly, and I&#x27;m done. As for placement of rollers, I think symmetry is good (not random placement of various sizes, like someone suggested -- normal hair growth patterns supply their own frustrating randomness!), but a bricklaying pattern rather than columns helps prevent splits, especially around the \\&quot;cowlick\\&quot; areas that I seem to always be fighting.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my long hair - it heats up pretty well - though I must say there are some uneven heat spots. You have to let it heat up at least 15 minutes to ensure max heat.  also a good idea to purchase extra roller holders (clips) separately, so you can put as many rollers in as you want  the set only comes with 12 or something like that...</li>
    <li> These are the best hot rollers. Definitely worth the money. Just wish they would have included more of the hair clips. Other than that, they heat quickly and the curls holds well.</li>
    <li> Sooooo happy with this product, use it almost daily.  Only complaint is same I have seen in other reviews and that is, not enough clips!  Certainly lives up to it&#x27;s reviews. I love the cover that snaps on and stays on.</li>
    <li> I like that this set of rollers has 30 different rollers and in 4 different sizes so you can create many different looks. I do wish there were more clips to hold the rollers in your hair,but they are still high quality and get extremely hot-be careful.I use them often!</li>
    <li> These rollers do NOT get hot enough to curl thick or heavy hair!! Not happy with them at all, can Not use them!</li>
    <li> I recently spent weeks in search of a set of hot rollers with teeth or ribs. All I could find   was the kind with spongey stuff around them. I have been using hot rollers for years and   have long hair and no body. I used the easy Start set for years but have to replace it once or  twice a year but I didn&#x27;t mind because it was the only ribbed set I could find.   I had to wake up an hour early to plug it in to heat it up. I couldn&#x27;t find them either so  I searched the internet and found the Babybliss Pro Hairsetter. I hesitated to order it   because it had so many rollers and seemed a little expensive. I finally gave in as my old rollers   fell apart. I ordered the set for about $45.00 plus shipping. I got it 3 days later and I love it.   It heats up fast and has 4 different sizes of rollers 8 of each including a larger roller that works   great on my long hair. I have been experimenting with the other sizes and having fun with the   tighter curls and fun new looks. Oh by the way the day I received my new curlers I went into the   local store and found about 20 of my old set on an end cap display for $19.95.  Don&#x27;t regret the  money spent on my Babybliss Pro Hairsetter one bit. You get what you pay for. We&#x27;ll see how long   they last hopefully I won&#x27;t need new ones for many years!!  Carla</li>
    <li> They heat up fast. easy to put on.They curl hair in 10-30 mins. depending on hair type.   i like popping them on and letting them sit while i do my makeup and get dressed</li>
    <li> amazing and works wonders</li>
    <li> Ordered from Amazon.com - GREAT PRODUCT, but hate the clips that come with this product.  Roller is not secured well with the deliverd clip.  I ended up using the clips from my old set.</li>
    <li> Loved the variety of sizes. Was shipped very quickly. Was a little disappointed at how long they actually stay hot after rolled in your hair. They cool very quickly (within 6-8 minutes), so if you want your hair to set well, leave them in longer than you planned.</li>
    <li> I love these rollers ! They curl my colored hair in 10 min. This is my third try with electric rollers and these are my favorites !</li>
    <li> Rollers were a birthday gift for my sister, she loves them.</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length, straight hair that&#x27;s limp and flat within 3 hours of shampooing if I don&#x27;t style it (I am really not exaggerating this). I had no problems with these rollers heating up to very hot within 5 minutes and I left them in my hair about 10-15 minutes, depending on how much time I had. My hair looks fantastic with these - more body, more volume, and waves or curls depending on the size I used. I sprayed my hair lightly with hairspray before and after to help out, but that&#x27;s all I really did. Just make sure you have the switch on \\&quot;In use\\&quot; as opposed to \\&quot;standby\\&quot; and heat them up with the lid on. I left them on \\&quot;in use\\&quot; even after I took the lid off and was putting them in my hair and I had no problems. You will have to buy more hair clips - as everyone said already, only 15 clips for 30 rollers is, let&#x27;s face it, retarded. This is the only reason I rated this item 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
    <li> Have had for about a week. Curls last about 4 hours. They are beautiful at first and then hair looks really nappy after 4 hours. Not happy with product. will be returning.</li>
    <li> I bought these rollers a year ago, I do hair and makeup on different people on a regular basis, and thought these would be hot enough and ive heard that ceramic is better. After 4 months of using them i decided i didnt like them at all. First of all you have to keep the plastic cover on while they heat up unless they will not get hot enough. and the min you take it off to get a roller all the heat escapes, so i had to keep taking off the plastic top and putting it back on with each roller, annoying. The ceramic rollers have teeth, or tred on them to grip the hair, which makes sense, but then you get wierd dents in your hair which i am not a fan of. The clips suck and they dont give you enough, they also leave dents in your hair. I used to think the metal pins were bad but compared to theses id rather use them. They are extremely hot and slippery smooth to the touch so you burn your fingers off trying to roll the hair in them, but THEN they  dont hold the heat for long enough to make the style stay for longer than 1-2 hours. mad i bought them for 60.00</li>
    <li> I have had this set for about 6 months and love them.  They heat up quickly and curl my hair.  I have thick hard to curl hair and most sets do not get hot enough to curl my hair.  This set does!!!  At first I thought the clips would not hold up but I was wrong.  The clips work great.  I like them much more that the pin clips that I have had with other sets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:I have had the set 2 years now and they still work great!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so sad that I have to return this product.  I thought it would be the best thing ever but like many of the reviewers said that it takes really long time to heat up and to get it hot enough to use is about 30 mins plus.  So I ended up keeping my old conair that I have for over 7 years.  I do love the different sizes of the rollers and the light weight of them on my head.</li>
    <li> This roller set is perfect!  With other hot roller sets, I&#x27;ve had difficulty keeping the bobby-pin style clips in (I have thick hair).  I tried another set of rollers with a jaw-style clip, but the clips left impressions in my hair. The clips in this set are very easy to use and stay in place.  I like the variety of roller sizes too.  I read a review (on another site) mentioning that the set does not get hot enough.  I had that impression too until I realized I had the switch on the \\&quot;standby\\&quot; setting. Plug the set in, turn the switch to the \\&quot;in use\\&quot; setting, and you&#x27;ll have hot rollers in under 5 minutes.  If you leave the set \\&quot;in use\\&quot; for longer than that, you will have piping hot rollers.  Just switch the set over to \\&quot;standby\\&quot; to cool them off a bit.</li>
    <li> a lot of money but a good product.  too big for my cottage bathroom so i have to keep it in another room</li>
    <li> Rollers are very nice.  Shipping was good.  However, I was not happy with the clips that came with this product.  Did not hold the rollers in place very well.</li>
    <li> the clips are insane.  These rollers heat fast, are kind to hair with their smooth ceramic finish and the curl sets well.  I gave them 3 stars because the clips are not good.  Fortunately I saved the pins from my old hot rollers and I use those.  The fact that there are 30 rollers but only 15 clips is really retarded.  The clips stick out so far that when I reach around the back of my head I run into the clips and dislodge them.  They are awkward and not very user friendly.  I didn&#x27;t like that I had to buy a box of 10 clips to have enough for my hair, either.  That cost the product another star.  Am looking for a set of old style bent heavy wire pins which work much better, but the rollers themselves are great!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the hair roller set.  I have long hair and it saves me time vs using a curling iron.  I had a delivery issue with Fedex and the selle, My Beauty Warehouse, was extremely promt in addressing the issue and sending a replacement.</li>
    <li> The curlers, though there are plenty of each size, do not have any kind of center that holds the heat.  Therefore, the only heat comes from the metal piece sticking up out of the base.  Once you remove the curler the heat dissipates VERY QUICKLY.  Therefore the curl is very lax.  Some may like that, but I wanted a tighter curl.  Also, the clips that fit on the curler don&#x27;t work well for me and again contribute to a very relaxed curl.  I prefer the metal pins.  Or maybe I need a tutorial on how to put the clips on (maybe the obvious way is not the correct way).</li>
    <li> Finally - there are enough rollers to do the job!  Only issue . . . not enough clips so I use the smaller clips from my old Clariol set!  Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied!</li>
    <li> These are the best hot rollers I&#x27;ve ever owned. And there are 30 in the set with 4 sizes... never had a set this big either. They heat up in 4-5 minutes. I have long slightly curly hair, of average thickness. If I want a curlier do, I leave the rollers in until they are completely cool (15-20 minutes - just the right amount of time to get my make-up on and dressed for work) and I have loads of curls. For a straighter style, with lots of volume, I use the large rollers, but only leave them in for a few minutes. These rollers allow for style versatility. And I find them much easier to use than curling irons.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these curlers for several months now and have been very pleased. My hair is 2-3 inches below my shoulders. I have experimented with the different sizes at different parts of my hair. For larger curls, I use pink on the sides, blue on the top/crown, blue &amp; purple on the back. I rarely use the smallest, green curlers. I&#x27;ve found that the curls hold best with a little bit of hairspray before putting in the curlers. I usually let the curlers set for at least 20 minutes, spray with hairspray when I take them out, run my fingers through my hair, spray again, and I&#x27;m ready!</li>
    <li> Love this set.   It is easy to use especially with the clips and gets plenty hot. And there are a lot of rollers - which I need for my long thick hair.</li>
    <li> My hair was getting fried by using a curling iron every day. Plus the iron took too much time in my morning routine since you have to hold the iron on each section of hair. But in the past I&#x27;d tried other hot rollers that just didn&#x27;t curl my hair that well &amp; the style never held up. However, these rollers get nice &amp; hot within about 5-10 min. The clips that came with them are easy to put in &amp; hold the rollers in securely. I leave the rollers in for about 10-15 minutes then remove them &amp; let the hair cool down for another 5-10 minutes before styling. The curls are bouncy &amp; my hair looks healthy &amp; shiny rather than dry, frizzy &amp; dull like it did with the iron. I like the fact that this set includes 30 rollers. My hair stylist gave me a few tips on roller placement etc. I&#x27;m really happy with these hot rollers. They&#x27;ve helped me shave precious time off my morning schedule &amp; my hair looks like I spent a lot of time on it.</li>
    <li> I bought a new set and love the idea of 30 rollers and the variety of sizes. I wasn&#x27;t too thrilled with only being given 15 clips for 30 rollers...(seriously?) but what seemed worse was that the rollers didnt seem to get very hot...after about 20 + mins they didnt get hot enought to curl. I have thick hair and noticed w/out any internal metal they dont really have much to stay hot with either.  One person commented on the &#x27;stand by&#x27; versus &#x27;in use&#x27; setting and by switching it over to &#x27;in use&#x27; they got hotter...does anyone know about that or know where that switch is?     Thanks</li>
    <li> Instant heating as described on the box is not accurate. In my mind instant is right away or maybe within a minute.  With this roller it took about 5 minutes to get warm and longer to get hot. At first I thought the product was defective. However once it got hot the rollers felt hot for a while after it was turned off. Also the curls lasted only 3 hours. Product was returned because it was not to my expectation. The hair roller clamps that came with the set worked very well though I had to order extra since there were less clamps in the set than rollers.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use.  This is the first hot roller set I&#x27;ve had where I&#x27;ve actually had plenty of curlers to roll all my hair at one time.  Love them!</li>
    <li> Love this hot roller set. Heats up quickly! The dif sizes give me style options. Clips hold well. I don&#x27;t use more than 15 rollers at a time, so 15 clips that come with the set are just fine. I recommend.</li>
    <li> I change  the length of my hair frequently.  These rollers are great for short or long hair.  I really like the fact that the rollers will get warm, hot or very hot according to the length of time they are on.  Also, when the temp is just right, you can put them on &amp;#34;Standby&amp;#34; to hold that temp.  I don&#x27;t understand why some of the reviewers stated that they don&#x27;t get hot.  That is just not true.  Also, they are very portable and can be easily carried.</li>
    <li> These rollers get very hot which is good, but left my hair very frizzy.  I didn&#x27;t like the end result.  Ready to give these away.</li>
    <li> I like that they come in different sizes and you get to choose a tighter curl or loose. I love them</li>
    <li> I read good reviews on these rollers but when i tried them they didn&#x27;t curl my hair the way I wanted it to. I don&#x27;t know if the curlers needed to be heated longer but i had them heating for an hour and on the directions doesn&#x27;t even mention how long you should leave them heating for better results. So i will try again and let them heat up longer and see if that works...</li>
    <li> Takes too long to heat up, then too hot to handle. .&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed after I heard so many good things about Babybliss</li>
    <li> BEST ITEM EVER PURCHASED ON AMAZON.&lt;br /&gt;I have thin hair that usually never holds a curl longer than an hour. With this product my&lt;br /&gt;hair is still curly after an 8 hour day and still full of body in the morning after sleeping on it.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use. I also purchase extra  clips when I ordered the roller after reading the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;My guess as to why they only include 15 is you really can only fit about 15 curlers on your head at once but I thought it was stupid too not to have 30 clips with the 30 rollers. What I do love is I curl my hair differently every day by using the different sizes. It takes me maybe 5 mins to roll up my hair and most days I only leave them in for 5 mins when I only want body and 8-10 mins when I want curl. I WILL NEVER US A CURLING IRON AGAIN! I would recommend this product to everyone and I have to my family and friends.</li>
    <li> This is a good set of curlers. In hindsight I wish I had bought only jumbo and large size rods but since I have very fine hair I usually only need the amount of bigger rods provided. I guess there may be a time when I will use the really small ones so I am not really complaining. If you like varied styles then, of course, this is a plus for you. I&#x27;ve noticed that the outer rods don&#x27;t heat up as fast as the rods in the center. Since I don&#x27;t really use the outer rows I don&#x27;t care but if you are in a hurry this might be slightly annoying. The clips are a little hard to handle at first because the hinges are tight but this is a plus for down the road because they will last longer. I think others have said that with time you will get used to rolling up your hair on these (if this is your first time or if you are used to foam cores) but at first beginners may feel that they are juggling a bit. Last thing: I wish that these sets had a high and low setting. Some hair, like mine, does not need super high heat to set. I just put it on standby though and that seems to knock the heat down a touch.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s enough for two head and is very, very large.  As I take mine on trips, this will not do.</li>
    <li> This product is great! Description is just like the product. Instructions don&#x27;t tell what all the buttons (&amp;#34;in use &amp; stand by&amp;#34;) mean. I am a new user to these kind of curlers. Like the variety of sizes of rollers.</li>
    <li> I have wavy unruly long hair. I don&#x27;t wanna blow dry til it&#x27;s thin and straight so i bought this to use on wavy hair, just to kinda help make it look neat. It&#x27;s good.. the only thing i don&#x27;t appreciate is the clips cuz they&#x27;re too large. I wish they made pins to somehow hold the rollers in instead of those large clips.</li>
    <li> I am in love with these curlers. They are the best curlers ever. Even though they don&#x27;t come with enough clips, they are the best curlers for hair that is sometimes unmanageable.</li>
    <li> I ordered these after my stylist suggested that maybe my flat iron was damaging my hair. My hair is long and would be descibed as &amp;#34;coarse&amp;#34; . I started looking for hot rollers and while these were a little more expensive than I had planned I am glad I spent the extra $$.&lt;br /&gt;  First, you get a lot of rollers and  different sizes so you can do lots of different things with your hair. These heat up fast. At first , I thought they were not heating because the rollers were still cool to the touch. Don&#x27;t be fooled. They are hot. Easy to roll up . Even my long hair. And the clips are awesome. They secure the hair very nicely. Go about your business while your hair sets. Depending on how long you leave the rollers in determines the tightness of the curls. Yesterday I left them in for about 45 minutes and the durls were very tight. Today I left them in just  while I was putting on my makeup and had softer curls. Like a soft perm. Very nice.  I am very pleased with this set.</li>
    <li> I love the ceramic instant heat curlers. They are more difficult to roll hair than flocked...but if you are used to hot curlers, you won&#x27;t have problem...just have to get used to. It is so WRONG to get a 30 curler set and have only 15 clips.And this set IS NOT cheap...so the only thing I can figure is because most people don&#x27;t use hot curlers...they don&#x27;t care about those that do. BUT the hair clips they send are a JOKE. If you are putting in one or two curlers they will work....but as for me, and some other baby boomers,who want to roll all our hair...the clips  WILL NOT  hold on the back...they will NOT let you put curlers close to each other. IF you have the metal pins left over from some previous sets of hot rollers, they will work great! I tried contacting manufactor to see if I could purchase some addition large rollers (I have long hair)....it took days for them to get back to me, they told me to contact this other company...I did as instructed...they acted as if I was crazy.  As for the actual curlers. they heat quickly, they do the job...don&#x27;t count on clips to work...and if you need addition rollers....good luck with that!</li>
    <li> Gave this product a couple of tries but it&#x27;s just not for me. First off, it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to create lasting frizz-free curls. If you have thick hair I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to work for you. Also, can someone explain to me why they only include 15 clips in a 30 piece set? I do love the clips so that&#x27;s 1 star. And I like the variety in sizes although I&#x27;d rather have more large rollers than the tiny ones that I would never have any use for. So unfortunately I had to return this set. Will continue on my search for the perfect hot roller set....</li>
    <li> Love the rollers but you do not need to order extra clips they have plenty! Made it sounds as if you needed to order clips!</li>
    <li> These hot rollers are the best!  Heat fast, sizes work well for many styles, and number of rollers is sufficient for long and short hair.  The only bad thing about them is there are only 15 clips and 30 rollers, I do not understand why the manufacturer would not give 30 clips.  Luckily, I have other clips that work with these rollers. The case is large, it has to be for the number of rollers, this will not trave well but I will deal with that to get the curl I want.  I have very fine, limp hair.  I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> The rollers container is VERY LARGE.  The rollers work well but I am disappointed in how large the container for them is.  I want hot rollers that can easily travel as well as not take up my whole counter space.</li>
    <li> I love all the different sized rollers and the heat up&lt;br /&gt;is fast.  There really should be more clips and smaller&lt;br /&gt;ones for the smallest rollers.  Otherwise, it met all&lt;br /&gt;my expectations.</li>
    <li> Very good.  The plastic clips are not working well.  Need to buy extra metal clips.  The rollers are very light.</li>
    <li> Hot rollers are such a time saver over hot irons. Get the u shape electric roller clips for a tighter hold. I use both the U shape clip and the clip that came with this set if I have a place where little pieces of hair don&#x27;t want to hold down on the roller. I got 2 packs of the Spilo professional electric roller clips 8 count and they work perfectly with this hot roller set.</li>
    <li> I LOVE these rollers. I have tried flocked rollers and curling irons and cannot seem to get my hair to keep a curl. I searched for the perfect rollers and I have found them! They are pricy but worth it because they will keep amazing curls for about 8 hours, even with stubborn, long hair like mine. My hair also will not hold the ones with the pins in them, so the butterfly clips are great. Yes, so many women are complaining about the 15 butterfly clips and not 30. I think you should win a prize if you can fit 30 butterfly clips in your hair, ladies. They gave you 15 for a reason. You don&#x27;t need 30 unless you&#x27;re prone to losing them. The clips also come in a great handy bag for travel. Yay! Great rollers.</li>
    <li> I was happy with this hairsetter, and used it for the last two years, then the heating element went out.  I will not be replacing it  with another one, especially since the price has gone up.  I have owned less expensive hairsetters that have lasted longer</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter, she was looking for hot rollers, I did some research and bought this one, she told me they work great she has long and thick hair and had problems finding rollers that would stay on her hair, but these work great!!!</li>
    <li> Best rollers I&#x27;ve used. However, I wish the curls would stay in longer. Other than that, I am in love.</li>
    <li> I looked for sometime before settling on this set. I love it!</li>
    <li> These are great....just wish the clips were different. The claw clips leave an indention.</li>
    <li> These take an inordinate amount of time to heat properly  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> These curlers heat well but so do the ends of the rollers. Even with the standby mode they are too hot to handle. They also cool too fast for longer hair. Consequently the ends of the hair get all the heat and gets frizzy. The old wax core rollers were the best!</li>
    <li> These work great.  The set is a bit larger than I imagined...the only complaint I have is that they don&#x27;t provide an equal amount of clips to rollers.  Other than that..it&#x27;s a great set! :)</li>
    <li> I have thick hair that will normally style anyway; however, this has just sat under my sink since I used it a couple times and wasn&#x27;t happy.  This does not mean it will not work, but it just did not work well for me.  It does curl my hair but they fall out half way through the day, so I will give it three stars for working somewhat.</li>
    <li> I bought these rollers looking for something that had more heat and more rollers than the Remington ones that I had been using and my son broke.  I have very thick coarse hair.  I&#x27;ve tried about every drug store brand out there.  These have to be the worst \\&quot;hot\\&quot; rollers that I have ever tried.  Sure, there are more of them and they are packaged pretty but they did absolutely nothing for my hair.  I even let them heat for over an hour....nothing, no curl, barely any heat.  The rollers themselves are plastic.  They don&#x27;t have any kind of heat conductive core that would retain the heat of the metallic base.  This could be the problem or they are just crap.  Don&#x27;t waste your time on these.  Buy 2 sets of cheap Remingtons instead.</li>
    <li> excellent product, does all it is advertised to do and is well constructed. I wish I could get more small rollers and heating stations for same.</li>
    <li> The 30 Babyliss rollers come in four different sizes. I especially like the small ones because they are so hard to find. The rollers have \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; and grab the hair when you roll the hair around them. The clips hold the rollers perfectly in place. These are the best rollers I have ever used, and since I am a senior citizen that has been many years.</li>
    <li> Does not get hot enough to really curl. Really disappointed</li>
    <li> They work great! I love having a variety of curler sizes to choose from.  Having less clips then rollers is ok for me. I&#x27;ll never have 30 rollers (thus needing 30 clips) in my hair at the same time.  And u can always order more clips seperately.  There is also a lid for this product.  (You can&#x27;t tell from the pics or description)</li>
    <li> A good selection of roller sizes, very effective clips ,heats quickly Curls are beautiful</li>
    <li> Received on time... Packaged properly...&lt;br /&gt;Heats up nicely .... sooo far... only a few months old... they all start out strong.&lt;br /&gt;its how long you get from the purchase...lets see how long product it lasts.&lt;br /&gt;The cover as stated does not stay latched to travel with.. manufacturer issue..&lt;br /&gt;Also the cover is plastic and for some unkown reason to me along the top seam there are&lt;br /&gt;scatch marks forming.. nothing is on it ...???</li>
    <li> I DO NOT recommend because the heating  mechanism in these did not even last for six months.</li>
    <li> I would still be using my 30-year old Clairol set if they weren&#x27;t falling apart. the &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;cogs&amp;#34; on the old roller set are literally crumbling off a little at a time. but even after all these years, they get much hotter than these new babyliss. the Clairol set itself is also much smaller and lighter weight. I also liked the way the Clairol set held the roller on-they would stay tighter to your scalp; the clip situation was much like a cotter pin. the plastic cover on the babyliss set is not hooked up by a hinge situation so I must use both hands to take the top off and put it back on instead of just flipping the Clairol set&#x27;s top up and down.&lt;br /&gt;babyliss set is attractive.</li>
    <li> Really convenient. Heats up in 90 seconds by the time I finish rolling my hair. It is already done! Love it!</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t like the way the rollers are made. The Revlon Rollers hold the heat inside the rollers and these don&#x27;t. They don&#x27;t even give you one clip for each roller. I had really really short hair when I ordered this product and I just wanted to have this on hand so when my hair got long enough I could have something here to use. Boy that was a big mistake. My 30 plus days have went by to send it back as I did not open the box for a couple of months. I won&#x27;t do that again.</li>
    <li> I love that this hot roller set has so many sizes and they get nice and hot so it doesn&#x27;t take long to get your hair rolled and finished with in 20 min. even my client mentioned how she liked the different roller sizes, her hair came out awesome.</li>
    <li> I love these.  They heat up quickly and work wonderfully.  I like having the different sizes to choose from as well.  They work well on my long hair as well as my daughters shorter hair.</li>
    <li> These rollers are well worth the price.My hair is long \\&quot;below shoulders\\&quot; plenty enough rollers to put all my hair up at once.Fast and easy.You will need to purchase extra roller clips if your hair is longer.</li>
    <li> These work really well but there are too many different sizes and not that many of each type. I would prefer to have less variety of sizes and more a particular size. I have to use all the rollers for my hair and because the sizes vary so much it leaves my hair looking a little messy. I would prefer to have just 2 or maybe 3 different sizes.</li>
    <li> They get very hot and are hard to roll in your hair. If I had it to do again I would have gotten rollers that are lined as to not burn your hair.</li>
    <li> Horrible rollers that do not curl hair.</li>
    <li> A very good item- it works well.  If I have any complaint about it , it would be its size.  Takes up too much space in my closet.</li>
    <li> I needed something without the velvet to heat and hold my hair!  These do the job perfectly!  Hot and holds curl!</li>
    <li> There is no metal inside just a hollow plastic curler so the curls don&#x27;t last a long time at all it&#x27;s also way too bulky to take with you anywhere</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my wife and she seems satisfied with it. Since I don&#x27;t use it, can&#x27;t offer any personal experience.</li>
    <li> This is a great set, provides long lasting curls and is easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;However, if you roll them all the way up on medium length hair, they work SO well, you will have banana curls - I find it easier to just roll the ends.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews on these curlers prior to purchasing. There were a few negative remarks but I went ahead and made the purchase. They are wonderful! The curlers are each so light weight I wondered if they would give a good curl. Great, lasting curl. The 15 clips were plenty that came with the set but I purchased additional ones just in case. No disappointment in this purchase!</li>
    <li> This is my second review, the first never published???? Plugged the set in and immediately started smelling a burning odor, then smoke came out of the unit! Defective merchandise, perhaps so, haven&#x27;t read any reviews to state this happened with their order. This is how I make decisions via purchases online, really like the fact there are different size curlers, but regret that the unit most likely is defective. Have left the seller a message, and like I already stated this is my second review, the first never published!  Good or Bad, it&#x27;s incumbent on the seller and Amazon to publish, so customers understand pro&#x27;s/cons. Not sure I will consider purchase again from this company. Will follow up when/if I hear from company regarding issues with unit.</li>
    <li> The variety of sizes, the temperature, it all works!  The best part is that they do not slip out of my hair and they do not burn my scalp.</li>
    <li> Great &#x27;staff&#x27; curlers  stay longer..recomend any one to buy them</li>
    <li> I like them, thank you</li>
    <li> This set doesn&#x27;t get as hot as the older sets of curlers that I am used too. The instructions say to leave the plastic lid on while heating but the sticker on the lid says to remove the lid while in use, so it makes me concerned that the lid will melt. The clips and curlers leave dents in my curls. The curls are also a &amp;#34;frizzier&amp;#34; curl rather than a smooth glossy curl. I have been using curlers almost everyday for over 17 years and this has been one of my least favorite sets that I have owned. I would not purchase these again. The set is also very big and bulky. It takes up a lot of counter space.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got to get used to rolling my hair again. I used to have a set of these and someone stole them. So it&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve rolled my hair with hot rollers. You&#x27;ve just got to be mindful of that HOT HOLE you&#x27;re so tempted to stick your finger in to turn the roller. I&#x27;m used to those blue plastic magnetic rollers and the first couple hot rollers REMINDED me quickly that I was not using those. lol.</li>
    <li> Fits my needs.  Heats up in a decent amount of time.  Only wish they furnished enough clips for all the rollers.</li>
    <li> Works great. Nice case too!</li>
    <li> My hair is baby fine and they did not get hot enough for me, however I sold them to my friend and she loves them.</li>
    <li> Got the hot curlers and they work great. The provided clips are a joke and not enough are provided so be sure to buy a set of clips from another place.</li>
    <li> these came in a very short time, first time  i used them i was a little shock, they give you hair great body lots of shine, they work great</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a hot roller set for almost a year and a half. I was having trouble committing to one because I have very thick curly hair. When I saw that the set had six jumbo rollers I couldn&#x27;t pass it up, I wanted to set my hair to have loose sexy curls! I absolutely love this hot roller set! I did go ahead and buy a box of extra clips, just in case! I have a hair straightener from the same company and it&#x27;s last me for years and I expect the same quality and have not been disappointed by this roller set too!</li>
    <li> I have to say Amazon is great! This product claims it is &amp;#34;instant heat&amp;#34; which it is not. The curlers did not even get hot enough after 10 minutes to hold a curl in my hair! I returned the product within 2 days of receiving it and had no problem with Amazon refunding my money. They didn&#x27;t even charge me to ship the item back! The money was back on my credit card within a day! Amazon has made me one happy customer and it is not their fault that this is a crappy set of rollers to say the least! Do NOT buy these, especially at this price!</li>
    <li> I think that this is an excellent hot roller set.  The curlers heat up quickly and provide strong hold.  I just wish that it had come with 30 clips too.</li>
    <li> nice set but does not heat up as rapidly as my older, vintage sets do and it takes longer for these rollers to curl my hair. I am still thinking about returning it I only tried it once and wasn&#x27;t happy.</li>
    <li> Awesome - quick ship! Perfect!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed.  Larger set perfect.  Enough to do entire head roll instead of too much hair on a single roller.</li>
    <li> I just received these Babyliss hot rollers two days ago and I am thrilled with them already! I love how many roller there are as I have very long and thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;The best part is the clips that hold the rollers in place. They are lightweight, don&#x27;t cause creases and they really grip the rollers well.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this hot roller set. My only complaint is that I would like more clips. There aren&#x27;t enough for every roller.</li>
