### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>That is its best feature.  </li>
      <li>Wonderful product !</li>
      <li>Great protection for my kids.</li>
      <li>Great stuff.  </li>
      <li>Great sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>Great sunscreen.</li>
      <li>I was hoping that Alba Botanicas Mineral Sunscreen would be a good inexpensive choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a good price for this type of sunscreen.</li>
      <li>And then I made the mistake of trying Honest, because they had it at Costco for a good price.</li>
      <li>but it rubs in great and keeps my child burn free all day.</li>
      <li>This rubs and absorbs nicely, would buy again.</li>
      <li>Am not a kid, but am very allergic and it is perfect !</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t clump up goes on smooth and fairly inexpexnsive for the healthier category its in.</li>
      <li>for the price of most products that give you 3 oz.  </li>
      <li>Still I am searching for that elusive cheap, non-whitening, chemical sunscreen!</li>
      <li>but it leaves a much more opaque yellow-white color on the skin either because it has more titanium</li>
      <li>What I dislike is that when I put it on my face, and throughout the day happen to rub my eyes after touching my face it burns like hell.</li>
      <li>Love this sunblock.</li>
      <li>Since it is one of the &amp;#34;healthiest sunscreen&amp;#34; we will suck it up and use.  :)</li>
      <li>Overall Alba is not as good as Neutragena Mineral and may not even be as good a value since I can often find Neutragena on sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Alba is only good for 30 minutes in the water while Neutragena is good for 80.  </li>
      <li>Good product and fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Separates too easy.</li>
      <li>The lotion does rub in just fine</li>
      <li>It spreads fine, no issues with odor or anything.  </li>
      <li>Since I am using them to go out and exercise it is not that important.  </li>
      <li>Goes on smooth, not greasy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s totally possible that this is a great choice for people with no allergies</li>
      <li>It is cheap.  </li>
      <li>so I am more concerned about using sunscreen consistently.  </li>
      <li>Decent product but my kids don&#x27;t love the smell.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t go on your skin as easily as some other Alba products I&#x27;ve used, but is still effective as a sunscreen when used as directed.</li>
      <li>May go back to non-mineral kind, or try another type.</li>
      <li>So this year I bought the mineral kind from a local store.  </li>
      <li>Great for kids who swim ALL DAY LONG in the summer - it&#x27;s the only cheaply priced, non-toxic sunscreen that I&#x27;ve found on EWG that is water-resistant for 6+hours of swimming.</li>
      <li>We used the non-mineral version last year (sp45, very emollient kids sunscreen, purple-ish tube) and really liked it.  </li>
      <li>First tried Badger...</li>
      <li>It is the key ingredient in most broad-spectrum sunscreens and it makes me break out in a rash.  </li>
      <li>I like the fact that this is mineral but is gooey upon first application and smells rather medicinal.</li>
      <li>Neutrogena goes on much easier and is not as shiny</li>
      <li>Have 3 very sunburned kids.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>Bought it on sale at Whole Foods.</li>
      <li>much prefer sunscreens like Vanicream or Elta-MD that have zinc</li>
      <li>or it is a high SPF.  </li>
      <li>Seems to go on easy tho, little smell.</li>
      <li>Next, I will try their 45 spf product which has less Zinc Oxide and more Titanium Dioxide.</li>
      <li>It was hard to put on and left me super white, which is OK,</li>
      <li>It is hard to apply, and it does make you look a paler, but to be honest, while I do care about what I look like on the beach or at the pool, I prefer to be a bit paler than red from sunburn.</li>
      <li>This year I discovered that the non-mineral version has a significantly worse EWG rating than the mineral kind.  </li>
      <li>As someone who does not have any significant allergies or particularly sensitive skin, I was horrified when a day after trying a small amount of this sunscreen on my shoulders I woke up with both arms covered in hives.</li>

<li> Otherwise decent product for little ones</li>
<li> then it goes fairly clear but extremely shiny.  </li>
<li> but I would be extra careful if you have any sensitivities at all and definitely don&#x27;t slather it all over yourself (or your children)</li>
<li> That is fine with me since I don&#x27;t think there is enough research to prove that chemical sunscreens are dangerous.  </li>
<li> but they are not pure mineral sunscreens.  </li>
<li> I tried the sunscreen myself a couple of times and agreed - it makes our skin feel dry, tight, and itchy.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve never been allergic to any sunscreens - physical or chemical - in the past</li>
<li> Guess it&#x27;s so thick it leaves tiny gaps, maybe ?</li>
<li> Because its mineral it is hard to rub in and it does leave a white residue but at least I know where I have put it on.</li>
<li> This is especially difficult when it happens to my son, but I got it because it was rated as safe by the Environmental Working Group.</li>
<li> Too chunky and hard to apply</li>
<li> A bit thick</li>
<li> As compared to Neutrogena Mineral for Baby, it goes on very thick.  </li>
<li> just make it worse.  </li>
<li> but then I noticed I was inexplicably getting burned.</li>
<li> Perspiration during cycling caused incredibly painful eye irritation and vision imparement.</li>
<li> I have a very bad reaction to sunburn and the chemical sun block</li>
<li> This product is highly dangerous!!!!</li>
<li> so this was somewhat shocking.</li>

<ol>
    <li> Too chunky and hard to apply</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find the expiration date on mine? Seems to go on easy tho, little smell.</li>
    <li> We used the non-mineral version last year (sp45, very emollient kids sunscreen, purple-ish tube) and really liked it.  This year I discovered that the non-mineral version has a significantly worse EWG rating than the mineral kind.  So this year I bought the mineral kind from a local store.  It spreads fine, no issues with odor or anything.  It seems to protect skin as promised.  However, my toddler was complaining about his skin.  I tried the sunscreen myself a couple of times and agreed - it makes our skin feel dry, tight, and itchy.  Not &amp;#34;very emollient&amp;#34; at all!  May go back to non-mineral kind, or try another type.</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen.  Covers and protects when I&#x27;m in the pool.  My legs look white, so I know it&#x27;s protecting.</li>
    <li> Great for kids who swim ALL DAY LONG in the summer - it&#x27;s the only cheaply priced, non-toxic sunscreen that I&#x27;ve found on EWG that is water-resistant for 6+hours of swimming. It is hard to apply, and it does make you look a paler, but to be honest, while I do care about what I look like on the beach or at the pool, I prefer to be a bit paler than red from sunburn.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product ! Am not a kid, but am very allergic and it is perfect !</li>
    <li> First tried Badger...I use Sunscreen to play golf, not go into the water.  It was hard to put on and left me super white, which is OK, but then I noticed I was inexplicably getting burned. Guess it&#x27;s so thick it leaves tiny gaps, maybe ? Switched to this and it works like a charm. Next, I will try their 45 spf product which has less Zinc Oxide and more Titanium Dioxide.</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth, not greasy.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that this is mineral but is gooey upon first application and smells rather medicinal. The lotion does rub in just fine but I&#x27;ll likely try another line of Alba products after this one.</li>
    <li> I wanted inexpensive water-resistant sunscreen that did not contain avobenzone. It is the key ingredient in most broad-spectrum sunscreens and it makes me break out in a rash.  Most sunscreens that do not contain avobenzone are expensive.  I was hoping that Alba Botanicas Mineral Sunscreen would be a good inexpensive choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It is cheap.  The container has 4 oz. for the price of most products that give you 3 oz.  That is its best feature.  As compared to Neutrogena Mineral for Baby, it goes on very thick.  I had to rub a lot to get it on then it goes fairly clear but extremely shiny.  Also it does clump a bit. Neutrogena goes on much easier and is not as shiny but it leaves a much more opaque yellow-white color on the skin either because it has more titanium or it is a high SPF.  Alba is SPF 30 compared with Neutragena which is SPF 60.  Alba is only good for 30 minutes in the water while Neutragena is good for 80.  I do not like the way either of them look.  Since I am using them to go out and exercise it is not that important.  Overall Alba is not as good as Neutragena Mineral and may not even be as good a value since I can often find Neutragena on sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I much prefer sunscreens like Vanicream or Elta-MD that have zinc but they are not pure mineral sunscreens.  That is fine with me since I don&#x27;t think there is enough research to prove that chemical sunscreens are dangerous.  I have had several skin cancers removed so I am more concerned about using sunscreen consistently.  Since I don&#x27;t always want to look like a zombie except maybe when I exercise (even then the neighbors give me looks) I prefer sunscreens like the Elta, Cera-Ve AM and Vanicream that contain some chemicals with zinc.  Still I am searching for that elusive cheap, non-whitening, chemical sunscreen!</li>
    <li> Everything you&#x27;d expect for the price.  Doesn&#x27;t clump up goes on smooth and fairly inexpexnsive for the healthier category its in.</li>
    <li> Separates too easy. Otherwise decent product for little ones</li>
    <li> Love this sunblock. Bought it on sale at Whole Foods. Great protection for my kids. And then I made the mistake of trying Honest, because they had it at Costco for a good price. I used it the same way that I use the Alba, and my kids all burnt. I will be switching back to Alba!</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen. A bit thick but it rubs in great and keeps my child burn free all day.</li>
    <li> Decent product but my kids don&#x27;t love the smell.  Since it is one of the &amp;#34;healthiest sunscreen&amp;#34; we will suck it up and use.  :)</li>
    <li> As someone who does not have any significant allergies or particularly sensitive skin, I was horrified when a day after trying a small amount of this sunscreen on my shoulders I woke up with both arms covered in hives. I did a patch test the next day and verified that it was indeed this sunscreen that had caused the reaction. I&#x27;ve never been allergic to any sunscreens - physical or chemical - in the past so this was somewhat shocking. It&#x27;s totally possible that this is a great choice for people with no allergies but I would be extra careful if you have any sensitivities at all and definitely don&#x27;t slather it all over yourself (or your children) before you know how you&#x27;ll react.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t go on your skin as easily as some other Alba products I&#x27;ve used, but is still effective as a sunscreen when used as directed.</li>
    <li> This product is highly dangerous!!!! Applied to face prior to bicycling. Perspiration during cycling caused incredibly painful eye irritation and vision imparement.</li>
    <li> This is a good price for this type of sunscreen. Because its mineral it is hard to rub in and it does leave a white residue but at least I know where I have put it on. What I dislike is that when I put it on my face, and throughout the day happen to rub my eyes after touching my face it burns like hell. This is especially difficult when it happens to my son, but I got it because it was rated as safe by the Environmental Working Group.</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  I have a very bad reaction to sunburn and the chemical sun block just make it worse.  Alba allows me to go out in the sun anytime.</li>
    <li> We used this today and it did not work. Have 3 very sunburned kids.</li>
    <li> This rubs and absorbs nicely, would buy again.</li>
    <li> Good product and fast shipping. Thanks.</li>
