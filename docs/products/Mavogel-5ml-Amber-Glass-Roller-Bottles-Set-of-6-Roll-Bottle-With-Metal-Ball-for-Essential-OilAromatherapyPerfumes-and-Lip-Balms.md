<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Awesome Amber Glass Roller Bottles! I have been searching for good roller bottles for awhile now. I always hesitate because of mixed reviews, but I&#x27;m glad I went ahead and ordered these...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are made of thin amber glass, which is perfect for seeing the contents through the bottle. This way I can clearly tell how much liquid is inside so I don&#x27;t overfill, and so I can tell when to refill the bottle. Very convenient..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The set came with six 5ml amber glass bottles, six roller ball tops, and six screw on lids. the roller balls are super easy to attach and to detach. I admit that I was worried I would push them in and never get them out again, but I can remove them very easily!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lids screw on easily, but don&#x27;t sit just right. They wiggle around a tiny bit, but there have been no issues of leakage so it doesn&#x27;t concern me at all.. I really like using them to store perfumes and essential oil perfume blends! The quality is nice enough, and they definitely suit my purpose well. I would absolutely buy again. (I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.)</li>
    <li> Love these! Perfect size for blends and samples. They&#x27;re easy to fill with oils. Had no trouble reattaching the roller ball. I prefer these to the 10ml size because it&#x27;s tough to fill those without diluting the EOs too much.</li>
    <li> I like that these are glass with a metal ball to preserve essential oils. However, one arrives broken and the kids do not fit well. They don&#x27;t screw on securely and defiantly don&#x27;t sit snug on the ball tip which means I would never travel with these for fear of leaking. At $1 a piece I did not expect perfect but broken and misfit lids I mean I can&#x27;t recommend these.</li>
    <li> these are absolutely adorable!</li>
    <li> One of the bottles was broken in the bag, had to deal with shattered glass, not happy.</li>
    <li> Great size to carry around. Small opening need to use funnel.</li>
    <li> i would order again. like the size</li>
    <li> These are well made and easy to put together. The roller is smooth and even. I am using with fractionated coconut and essentail oils and they work perfectly. Thank you.</li>
    <li> easy to open, easy to close, don&#x27;t leak in hot or cold weather.</li>
    <li> Bottles looked like a good size for gifting samples and great portability, however, they are CHEAP and very thin. These bottles pose a serious danger to the user...  the end broke off!  The bottom of the bottle completely sheared off! Not only is this a waste of $$ for a broken bottle (and the rest that I will have to throw out due to safety concerns) but also a lot of $$ for the essential oils that poured out and saturated my purse after the roller bottle broke open. Now I have to find new bottles AND buy a new purse. Thank goodness the bottle broke for me and not my kids!</li>
    <li> when these bottles arrived, two of them were broken in little pieces. so i thought, okay, bad packaging. but i discovered they are made with very thin glass. none of any other bottles i have ever bought (which is alot, i have a small essential oil co.) have ever been so flimsy. i decided to give them a try anyway, they are cute as a button! but after filling one, i found that the lid did not screw on properly no matter how many ways i tried. !!! it couldnt even keep my blends contained without spilling all over. so i am returning these little worthless cuties. maybe i just got a bad or defective batch? from the other comments people seemed quite satisfied. but for me, these were a waste of time &amp; money.</li>
    <li> These are the perfect size for my essential oil blends. I did have a problem with a few of the roller balls not letting out very much liquid. For the price, they are great!</li>
    <li> Ball top doesn&#x27;t stay in. Didn&#x27;t realize how small the bottles would be. Will not purchase these again.</li>
    <li> Great little bottles for my essential oils.. I love the roller ball top.. One bottle came broken but Amazon replaced the whole order quickly</li>
    <li> They are small, but work really well if you only have a small amount of something you want to give out as a sample.  I like them!</li>
    <li> You get 6, 5 ml aromatherapy glass roll-on bottles for the price here.&lt;br /&gt;The roller balls snap in snugly.&lt;br /&gt;What I like about these is you get a good amount of oil from the roller ball, I have bought others where you struggle to get any product out.&lt;br /&gt;So these would be really great for any thicker preparations you might might, like a lip gloss for example.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using with essential oils you could use less essential oil and more carrier oil because of how easy it comes out, whatever your personal liking is.&lt;br /&gt;The lids fit tightly.&lt;br /&gt;I gave them a good shake to see if it would leak and I could get some out that way, but not easy, so these aren&#x27;t going to leak on you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got these for free in exchange for my honest review, and I honestly love them.</li>
    <li> Love them. Use them for the YL oils, love the size,&lt;br /&gt;everything works fine, love the metal ball, i have drop them a few tiemes and have had no troubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complain is filling them out, i made a mess coz the mouth on this is small (dnt know if its standard, they are the only ones i have tried) but the pump in my carrier oil didnt fit in there.</li>
    <li> Love these rollers so much, however one was broken when I received it. :(</li>
    <li> I bought these for my essential oils. Made the first to recipes. The worked really awesome. All the rest.. NOPE!. These balls will not roll no matter what I do. HUGE DISSAPOINTMENT!!!! Total aggravation!</li>
    <li> They were smaller than I expected because I didn&#x27;t read the description closely enough. At first I was disappointed until I realized they are the perfect size to share my essential oils since I don&#x27;t need to put as much in there. Excellent!  The glass seems thinner than the bigger bottles, so I wouldn&#x27;t put them in your pocket.</li>
    <li> The lids don&#x27;t fit the bottle. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> The roller balls are so tiny- I was expecting a larger ball. I won&#x27;t order these again.</li>
    <li> Love the little roll on bottles!  Perfect when traveling.</li>
    <li> The bottles are good, but one arrived without the roller ball insert.</li>
    <li> Roller ball falls out.</li>
    <li> The bottles were much bigger than I thought. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Bottles arrived with 1 broken. The bottom was completely broken off so oils could spill right out. The other 5 bottles had flimsy caps that do not stay on properly and the metal roller top does not allow enough oil to come out. Overall, waste of time and money. The other reviews giving this product 5-stars seem computerized since they all state they are &amp;#34;unbiased opinions&amp;#34; and are thankful for the &amp;#34;opportunity&amp;#34; to try the product.</li>
    <li> One of the bottles came broken.</li>
    <li> Fast service, exactly as described.</li>
    <li> These bottles are a perfect size for my needs however, immediately I noticed that the caps do not fit securely.  3 out of the 6 have leaked.  1 I had to throw away because the rollerball would not set correctly on the misshapen glass lip and the cover would not screw on at all.  I&#x27;ve used the 2 decently made ones for a couple of months but this morning the metal ball fell out of one of the roller tops.  I have lavender and frankincense in it, and I&#x27;m thinking the oil broke down the cheap plastic top.  Looking for another quality source for my next purchase.</li>
    <li> They are perfect size but I can&#x27;t carry them around because oil I put in the bottle keeps leaking. When I tilt the bottle oil also drips.</li>
    <li> Work great. perfect size</li>
    <li> They leak.  Lids don&#x27;t fit and end up with oil everywhere.</li>
    <li> these are great.... the metal ball is secure and the size is perfect</li>
    <li> Roller balls fall out when using certain essential oils. Otherwise ok.</li>
    <li> One of the bottles leaked. The rest were great.</li>
    <li> While the bottles are great quality, the small metal roller balls fall out when tipped over to apply my essential oils! It&#x27;s a nuisance to make sure the ball doesn&#x27;t fall out.</li>
    <li> ROLLER BALLS WILL NOT IN</li>
    <li> All  rollers were broke on arrival</li>
    <li> As described, no issues with shipping. Perfect for my small business needs.</li>
    <li> These are ok, 3 of the roller balls are loose and one actually fell out...</li>
    <li> It is what I expected. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Love these little 5ml bottles! Perfect size for sharing my favorite essential oil blends with others. High quality Amber glass, metal roller ball that is easy to remove but fits securely. Great product, I am ordering more!</li>
    <li> Going non toxic is the way to live. Love these tinted bottles to keep my products safe and last longer and the stainless steel roller fitment doesn&#x27;t degrade.</li>
    <li> These have worked out great for mixing my essential oil blends.</li>
    <li> Great for mixing up recipes to try!</li>
    <li> Perfect for your purse.</li>
    <li> Cool bottle.  I can&#x27;t wait to fill them.</li>
    <li> too thin too small! received one broken</li>
    <li> no essential oil collection is complete without a few glass roller balls. it&#x27;s one of the best ways to topically apply oil combinations without having to get oil everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;these vials came apart, meaning there were the bottles, the roller balls, and the lids. i didn&#x27;t have to pry them apart, i could just add my oils and go! and they&#x27;re 5ml, so they can be slipped in a bag or a purse very easily.&lt;br /&gt;i like putting a pain relieving blend i got in my vials. it targets the muscles, so i can pull it out, apply it to my legs (i do a lot of walking, and then i&#x27;m on my feet all day), put the cap back on, and continue my day. no splashing oil all over the place, trying to get the right amount. it&#x27;s already done for me. i also keep a bit of peppermint and rosehip in one, in case my head starts hurting from eyestrain, i can apply it to my temples or the back of my neck. bam, headache gone!&lt;br /&gt;i also like using a roller ball to apply lavender to my pillow and eye mask, so a drop doesn&#x27;t soak into one spot and not spread out. it&#x27;s very convenient! and with a six pack of these bottles, you have the option of doing all of these and more! a packet of labels can be gotten for pennies, if you do have multiple scents. and the dark glass of the bottles helps protect your oils! i&#x27;m 100% satisfied with these bottles.&lt;br /&gt;i received these bottles for free for my honest and unbiased review of them. i was not compensated in any way.</li>
    <li> These are very handy for just a little essential oil perfumes.</li>
    <li> loved them.  slight problem with a couple of the roller balls.  The appear they are too loose in the plastic sitting.  Still use the and love them though.</li>
    <li> When these arrived one was broken.  I contacted the seller and they nicely refunded me for the broken one.  I was disappointed though to see that they are very thin glass.  They work well, but you have to be very careful not to break them, as they do break easilly if dropped on a hard surface.&lt;br /&gt;I know because I have broken one myself.  All in all, a nice product if you are very careful with them.</li>
    <li> These are a great size for carrying in your purse or for traveling. They are narrow and not too short. I bought them as a test to see if they would be good for carrying overseas, I love them so much, I&#x27;ll be buying more for our trip. I use larger ones at home, but they are just too big and the 2ml bottles are just too small. These are perfect.</li>
    <li> they looked great but three of them when I filled them up exploded within seconds from the bottom, a little scary, think the glass is too thin</li>
    <li> I love these little roll on bottles!  I am always giving away what ever oil I have in my purse and would prefer to give away a smaller amount just in case someone doesn&#x27;t like the oil or it doesn&#x27;t work for them and these are the perfect size!!</li>
    <li> Have only used a couple times but no leaks or anything so far!</li>
    <li> Better buy than the larger ones. Lids fit well.</li>
    <li> Awesome little bottles for essential oils.</li>
    <li> I like the size of these glass rollers.  They hold just enough oil and fit in my pocket or purse to take with me.  I would purchase them again and they were delivered on time and fast.</li>
    <li> Roller cap doesn&#x27;t stay on</li>
    <li> I had 3 out of the 6 have loose screw tops. They would never close tightly.</li>
    <li> Purchased these to use with essential oils. They work great and there is no leaking! Will purchase again when I need more!</li>
    <li> I was very excited to have a smaller roller for my kids essential oils.  However, the glass is so thin. My 7 year old dropped the bottle on wood floor covered by an area rug and it shattered.  I love the metal roller ball as they are superior but it doesn&#x27;t match the quality of the glass.</li>
    <li> I guess I thought I was getting 10 ml</li>
    <li> Perfect size for giveaways, samples, and for carrying in your purse!</li>
    <li> love them, but make sure this is the size you really want!</li>
    <li> ...they were smaller than I realized. But when they came, I was fine with the smaller size for the essential oils I was using in them. I really liked the metal rollerballs. That is so much better than the plastic ones.</li>
    <li> Very nice bottle set, but one of the roller caps was missing a metal roller ball, making that bottle useless.</li>
    <li> Perfect for essential oils! These are easy to use and perfect for travel.</li>
    <li> One of the bottles was broken, but the others are good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed. First of all the glass is so thin I&#x27;m constantly worried it will break - forget about putting them in a purse. Second the lids don&#x27;t screw on completely. But the worst of all - they leak!  I don&#x27;t know if the ball is too small or what the problem is but my oils constantly spill. If I try to roll them on the skin way too much product comes out and everything gets messy</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of essential oils.I have around 50 bottles of essential oils, I have all kind of oils.I use essential oils for aromatherapy, making my personal deodorant and perfumes,Health benefits, even face oil and body oil.I never settle for one scent, I always keep on try something new.Pros are -&lt;br /&gt;1.These bottles are 5 ml, perfect size to blend different oils without wasting much quantity.Small size makes it so convenient to carry it in my hand bag.&lt;br /&gt;2.They are spill proof even if I accidentally knocked down a close bottle oil won&#x27;t spill.&lt;br /&gt;3.Essential oils have tendency to evaporate so essential oils should be packaged in dark colored glass, since this filters out the suns ultra-violet light.Amber color is literally perfect as it is dark but still you can see the level of oil inside.&lt;br /&gt;4.Having a roller attached is certainly a huge plus because it makes it perfect to store my favorite perfume or deodorant blend of essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s literally a life saver for me, so much convenient. I just make a mixture, write a number on the label and stick the label on the bottle.I keep a record of what quantity I used to make that number mix.I keep it for 24-48 hrs and after that if I like the smell of the particular blend I then make a large batch of it.I got this product for free as promotional sample in exchange of my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> These are great little rollers to make smaller blends with my essential oils.  The metal roller balls are fabulous.  I did receive one bottle with too skinny of a neck, so none of the caps will actually fit on the threads on that particular bottle.  The glass is a little thinner on these bottles than it is on most of the 10ml bottles, but just don&#x27;t be rough with them and it&#x27;s not a problem.  Overall, I would purchase again...</li>
    <li> Product as described and work very well.</li>
    <li> Love the 5mL size. Love the stainless steel roller ball but whats up with the plastic cap?  those of us that use these w/ therapeutic grade essential oils: I use Young Living oils. I make blends for my family and myself and others. There seems to be a cheap plastic that holds  the SS roller ball in place that snaps into the glass bottle. I am a little wary about using any citrus oils in these containers because I fear this plastic is cheap enough to become corroded or start to degrade with use of my oils. I will update my review once I use them for a while.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to blending oils. So I puchased these seemed like good price. For the most part I&#x27;m satisfied but some of the tops don&#x27;t fit right. Slightly off. 4 of bottles were fine but two the top wouldn&#x27;t close or fits off the grooves. No spills. I won&#x27;t buy these again.</li>
    <li> Great for mixing oils.</li>
    <li> All and all great,  but it would be extra helpful if there was a visual comparison of what 5ml is . I would have got a bigger size if I knew. The product was totally what it said it was though and the shipping was fast thank you!</li>
    <li> Really sad these didn&#x27;t hold up.. Balls fall out after a week, and one bottle shattered really easily in my purse... Ughhh</li>
    <li> These bottles are very thin. One was broken when I received the shipment and I have broken another one with very minimal use.</li>
    <li> The rollers do not leak, and are good quality for the two I have used. Work just as described. Nice product.</li>
    <li> I purchased these due to their low price, and I was pleasantly surprised at how much I actually liked them. They are super cute, and no leaks yet. I don&#x27;t mind that the glass is a bit lighter than other amber bottles I have purchased, and I really doubt my customers will either. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> These bottles are the perfect size to keep in your wallet or pocket. The metal rollers are very nice and glide without any hesitation.</li>
    <li> 3 of the bottle exploded while filling them with room temperature oil.  The balls fell out after only a couple usus</li>
    <li> Great product. But missing one lid. Did not receive all of product.</li>
    <li> Perfect size but the caps do not screw on right or tight, this making them leaky. do not recommend.</li>
    <li> These work great! I&#x27;ve tried a couple of different ones from Amazon which had 4+ star reviews and failed miserably - not these. Metal balls work just perfectly!</li>
    <li> These are easy to fill and assemble. They are smaller than I thought they would be but fit great in my pocket or purse. My only complaint is the screw top.. You can&#x27;t tighten too much or it looks like the plastic may break.. It bulges slightly.</li>
    <li> AWESOME TO BE ABLE TO SHARE THE OIL LIFE STYLE!</li>
    <li> Ordered 18 bottles  and it came with only 12 rollers.</li>
    <li> For making essential oil blends I would highly recommend this set.  The oil dispenses evenly, no need to prime the ball.  I have ordered from several sellers &amp; find these to be reliable, sturdy and so far leak-proof.</li>
    <li> Nice bottles and just as expected.</li>
    <li> Perfect for what I needed it for</li>
