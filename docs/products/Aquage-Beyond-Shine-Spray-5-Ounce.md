<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> leaves your hair shinny without making it greasy.  Love this product!</li>
    <li> Fantastic product. It will smooth out your ends of hair without looking greasy.&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t regret buying this.&lt;br /&gt;I spray on and scrunge hair. Or spray it on my fingers then touch hair.</li>
    <li> This suff works soooooo good on my hair while using a flat iron.</li>
    <li> I always aviod shine sprays because I have very fine long hair &amp; they all seam to weigh it down &amp; look greasy, not this brilliant shine, no static &amp; it acually seams to enhance the natural body in my hair. It also brings out my natural highlights! I only wash my hair a few times a week &amp; this is great for restyling. This is the best product, I never want to run out!! I tried this because of all the reveiws I read, Thank you all!!!</li>
    <li> Came just as expected. I love this stuff, makes your hair soft and shiny when you straighten it.</li>
    <li> My stylist used this on me about 4 years ago and I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since. It&#x27;s meant to improve the results of ceramic flat irons, and it really does. I don&#x27;t straighten my hair every day (maybe once a week) so this one bottle lasted for over 4 years. You don&#x27;t need much and it leaves your hair straighter, smoother and shinier than not using it. I love it!</li>
    <li> Nice shine to my white hair.</li>
    <li> I love using aquage while flat ironing my hair - it makes my hair shiny, soft and it feels very light.</li>
    <li> I have naturally wavy hair that is frizzy especially after drying it or any curling product....but not after spraying this product.  I wash hair as usual.  Towel dry.  Add a straightening product.  Dry as usual using a brush to pull hair downward.  Then lightly spray this product wherever frizzy.  Then use curling iron or curlers.  Because of this product people don&#x27;t even know how frizzy my hair is unless extreme extreme southern summer humidity.  Have used for years!</li>
    <li> I love this product so much. It protects my hair from the heat! it does not make it oily. it makes it easier to straighter and it makes your hair SOOOOO soft and shiny ! I HIGHLY recommend. :)</li>
    <li> I wanted to mention that this is a AWESOME product for people with long hair that tends to have a lot of static electricity in the winter. I&#x27;m a super static-y person and this stuff is great for keeping it under control. My hair doesn&#x27;t go crazy when I take a scarf off in cold weather anymore.</li>
    <li> Aquage Beyond Shine Spray was recommended by my stylist who uses it in his salon.  Just a spritz all over after drying my hair provides an incredible shine - this is a \\&quot;keeper\\&quot;!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I have been using it for several years and am not disappointed.  I was afraid when I moved to Tennessee from California, the humidity would effect it somehow but so far so good.</li>
    <li> Hard to spray the right amount on. The bathroom get &#x27;foogy&#x27; with the overspray. Don&#x27;t like the smell. Silicone is silicone. Prefer another product.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!! I use it before I flat iron my hair and it helps to protect it from the heat. I also like that it does not make your hair wet and it&#x27;s smells great! I like the Aquage shampoos and conditioners as well.</li>
    <li> Works wonders on dry hair when using flat irons or curling irons. Makes the hair shine and looks healthy. LOVE IT</li>
    <li> This is a great product that I have used for years.  Delivery was quick.  This is great to use to smooth hair in humid climates.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Great price</li>
    <li> My stylist used this on me and I was astonished by the results. My hair was super silky and shiny! I have very silky hair to begin with so I don&#x27;t usually see a difference with other products but when I use Beyond Shine I see amazing results. It CAN make your hair some what greasy if you use too much.. but I&#x27;m talking TOO much. This can very easily be avoided once you use it a couple times.     I&#x27;m really happy with my purchase and I&#x27;m going to continue to buy more.  :)</li>
    <li> I get a lot of compliments on the shine my hair reflects after using  this product.</li>
    <li> I only spray on the bottom few inches of my hair (roots tend to get oily by the end of the day); this spray makes my dry hair soft and touchable!</li>
    <li> I love this product; it makes your hair soft and silky and give it such a wonderful shine.  I was happy to find it on Amazon because you usually have to purchase it at a salon; the price was fantastic.</li>
    <li> My hair gets damaged extremely easily, even though I only flat iron my hair once or twice a month.  I bought this on a whim because I&#x27;d like to start wearing my hair down more.  I used it for the first time yesterday.  WOW!    It makes my hair sleek and shiny, and helps the flat iron glide over my hair without catching.  I LOVE it!</li>
    <li> I love this product!!! It protects the hair when using heat on the hair. Don&#x27;t spray to much or your hair will be greasy. Other then that it is a great product.</li>
    <li> I have really wavy and somewhat dry hair and I use a flat iron every day.  This stuff works great to keep my hair straight and softer (I do use other product with it when my hair is wet).  Good price, fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Product give my hair a silky shine when used with my flat iron. I love the feel of my hair after using it.</li>
    <li> Quite happy with this product. It adds needed shine to my hair. Just be careful with the amount you apply. I&#x27;ve gotten overzealous at times leaving a greasy look. Shiny good, greasy bad. User error, not a product issue.</li>
    <li> This was given to me by a friend of mine. I had never heard of it, so I thought ok well thanks (thinking I probably wouldn&#x27;t be using it)! I tried it one day, and I fell in love with it!❤️ I have bought many expensive products and have tried many brands, but nothing compares to this! I love the smell and how soft and shiny my hair feels and looks not leaving it greasy! You will love this stuff!😍</li>
    <li> Love this stuff - I use it in conjunction with my curling wand to make my hair super shiny and fabulous.  This stuff is great because it won&#x27;t make your hair look oily even if you use a lot.  Makes my hair appear smooth and frizz-free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minus one star because I have to use more than the recommended amount.  I have a lot of color-treated hair, so that may be the issue.  But it sure is shiny!</li>
    <li> Aquage always makes great hair products and this one is no exception. I use this spray when I flat iron to protect my hair from the heat. Definitely helps my hair look shinier and I know my hair has product to protect it from heat.</li>
    <li> I love it and use it everytime I straighten my hair! I have hard to manage hair, but it gives my hair a good shine and makes it feel silky smooth.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t overspray it, Aquage Beyond Shine is just right.  Light shine and protection before using hot iron.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years now and will continue to us it as long as it&#x27;s available.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  Really does go beyond shine.  After using it, everyone asks me if I&#x27;ve recently colored or highlighted my hair.  Hair looks shiny without looking greasy.</li>
    <li> Works great with heat! calms the frizz and sleeks down hair so it looks shiny.</li>
    <li> Lightweight, not greasy, I love this product!</li>
    <li> My hair has a beautiful shine to it when using Beyond Shine! Great product to use with a flat iron too!</li>
    <li> This spray smells wonderful and is especially useful when straightening out hair with a flat iron. It leaves a great sheen and smell to my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used this before and the first time I used it I used too much and my hair looked oily.  But now I&#x27;m spraying it on sparingly and when my hair is wet.  I let my hair dry naturally and then use a flat iron on it.  My hair looks so much better, smoother and shinier after ironing it with this product in my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years and believe it is the best at putting a shine on your hair either before blow drying - or as I use it after I straighten with my Chi.  I have coarse hair and this product keeps the frizzies down.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Makes my ceramic flat iron faster to use, and keeps my hair bouncy and shiny.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I am 50 yrs old with snow white wavy hair cut into a bob. I use Beyond Shine to prevent frying my fragile white strands prior to using a flat iron. Beyond Shine keeps my hair smooth and silky. The shine is unbelievable! I get many compliments just on the shine alone. Before I use this product my hair looks dry, dull and unmanageable. After washing and drying my hair, I spray Beyond Shine all over my hair as I lift strands to apply underneath. A little goes along way. This product was recommended by a stylist and I have been using it ever since. Not every salon carries this product so I was happy to find it on Amazon.com For me nothing else compares.</li>
    <li> This is the best shine spray and, despite the price, definitely worth it.  I have dry, frizzy hair and it totally transforms it.</li>
    <li> Love the pink packaging. Tried other brands and nothing works as well.&lt;br /&gt;Referred by my stylist who only uses the best.</li>
    <li> This is the best shine spray out there.  I have curly hair and use this after blow drying to get a straight sleek look.</li>
    <li> The best product on the market to use with a flat iron.  Protects my hair and helps to smooth it much quicker. My hair type is pretty course and can frizz with humidity easily. This definitely aids in smoothing and holding the smooth texture for a while....not forever if you live in a humid climate, but definitely helps!!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair shine I have used!  It is very light and doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down at all.  It is also great to use before you use heat on your hair, especially if you flat iron.</li>
    <li> Best product on the market.  I have long extensions and it is perfect in protecting them if heat styled.  Over use makes your hair kind of greasy so a little goes a long way.  In the salons it is $20 so it is pricey but I have tried so many other products and this is truly the best.  So I spend the money.  You can use it for heat styling or just to spray and brush thru your hair in the morning when rushed for time.  It gets out bedhead and makes your hair smooth and soft.  I highly recommend it.  Just wish the bottles were bigger and it was more affordable.  But you do get what you pay for.  It took me a long time and lots of fried extensions to figure out that my stylist was right.  I tried the cheap route and I was wrong. Oh spray more on the middle down to the tips of your hair (to avoid that greasy look at your top and the part that you have for the day).  Use Batiste dry shampoo at your part to fluff up the top and this product for the rest....easy.  Then go about your day.  I also recommend the 2 ounce small size for your purse for mid day touch ups and for travel!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It&#x27;s worth every penny! Shines my dull hair, softens stiff, overprocessed edges.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Got a great price ad great shipping. Very happy with purchase. I even got special Breast Cancer awareness pink canisters.</li>
    <li> Love this shine spray! Just - as with any shine spray - be careful not to put too much on, otherwise your hair will look greasy. Perfect for those days when I&#x27;ve packed on the dry shampoo instead of washing my hair!</li>
    <li> I love this product!! For someone who has very curly hair this product makes it so much easier to straighten!!</li>
    <li> My hair tends to get oily, but this product makes straightening easier and it leaves you with great looking hair.</li>
    <li> I always buy two cans at a time. This absolutely makes a huge difference before you straight iron your hair or use a curling iron. It protects your hair and makes frizzy hair look smooth and lots of shine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several years.  I can&#x27;t ever find it in a store or salon, so I just order it.  I spray it onto a section of hair before curling or straightening.  And then I follow up with hair spray.  Works like a charm, leaving shiny, styled tresses.  I&#x27;ve tried a few other similar products, and they didn&#x27;t compare.  I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been try into find this product for years! I love it! One bottle got me 2 years of amazingly silky straight hair. I used it each time I straighten my hair and it prevents all friziness and helps straighten quicker.</li>
    <li> My old hairdresser turned me on to this, my dry damaged hair would be shiny after even after using straightner.</li>
    <li> After using the uplifting foam to put body in hair, the use of the Shine product seems to weigh down my hair.  So I lose the advantage of putting a volumizer on my hair.</li>
    <li> Love this.  You can comb your hair after spraying and it still keeps the look, just has more shine.</li>
    <li> Awesome product.  I love the shine and hold.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this hair shine spray. My hair doesn&#x27;t need hairspray, gel or anything else to actually keep it in place. It just needs some extra shine. It&#x27;s become dull and dry as I age. I blow dry my hair first, then I spray this on and it looks shiny (but not greasy or fake) and feels soooooo soft. My daughter loves to run her fingers through it :) It&#x27;s so light weight that you wouldn&#x27;t remember you have anything in your hair. I used to use an oil to achieve the shine, but my hair felt oily and heavy. Not so with this. It smells so good too! I can only get it in my salon that is 20 minutes away, so I was very happy to find it here for the same price...without the drive!</li>
    <li> This spray has the consistency of spray deodorant. It comes out like an aerosol powder and gives no shine at all. I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have very fine and thinner hair and was worried this spray would weigh it down, but it does not - it works great.  I spray just a little on it and it reduces all friz and makes my hair shiny.  I&#x27;m very happy I found this product!</li>
    <li> I love the way this product gives your hair a real nice shine after shampoo and style. I have used it for years and it is the best.</li>
    <li> this is an amazing product for the protecting hair from a straightener! I love it and use it every time</li>
    <li> At my age I have tried numerous hair products and this one by far is the best!  I spray a scant amount into each lock of hair before I Chi it, and my hair is amazingly smooth.  My coworkers even noticed the difference in my hair and asked me what I was doing.  The smell is very faint and pleasant, not overpowering at all.  It only takes a little, too much causes oiliness.  My hair is color treated and long.  I chi it almost daily so the ends are really dry but this stuff works perfectly!</li>
    <li> WHEN YOU GO TO RETURN THIS TO THE SELLER, THE HAZARDOUS WASTE WARNING APPEARS!!&lt;br /&gt;OMG THAT ALONE SPEAKS FOR ITSELF!!!!!!! That is the most important. Secondly, the spray goes everywhere so you need to close your eyes because it reaks havoc on them! Thirdly, the smell is very profound and remains on the hair. IF YOU ARE ALLERGIC TO FRAGRANCE, DO NOT USE!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s powerful, and it helps with a flat iron for a silk, shinny finish.  It work really well with haspanic curly hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I was it came in larger sizes and was not so expensive.  I use it every day and so I run out of it quickly.  I do not like the price what so ever.  I have started looking for other products that are not as expensive but this is a good product just over priced.</li>
    <li> I heart this product!  My stylist used it on my long layered curly hair and I have never used anything else!  I wash and dry my hair then spray all over LIGHTLY.  I curl my hair with a large barreled curling iron, then run my fingers through the curls and sometimes respray lightly.  My curls stay for days and look so shiney and healthy.  Don&#x27;t overspray or it will look greasy.  I don&#x27;t even use hairspray anymore.  I little pricey, but sooo worth it.</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing product line ever! Beyond Shine Spray is so light &amp; the shine is teriffic.</li>
    <li> This product works great for those who use a flat iron. It smells great too!</li>
    <li> Unlike Mama&#x27;s old fashion hair spray - sticky  - smells chemical, The &#x27;Aquage Beyond Shine Hair Spray&#x27;  it gives a silky shiny healthy look to my hair.  If i do not have the time to go to the stylist,,,,  this particular Aqua spray can do the job so quick in making my hair looking natural and beautiful. I don&#x27;t spray too much though, just a bit would do the superb job.  also if i want a different style, of course this Aqua Shine would do the job as well, i spray a bit on my hair and i blow dry it by using a brush - - and will have the style that i desire.  I have used it for 13 years on my long hair, and now short hair, I use it proudly and I am very happy and pleased to have found the very best Hair Spray &#x27;Aquage Beyond Shine&#x27;. I believe men can use it, for a natural good looking hair.  Marie.</li>
    <li> LOVE! I use this every time I straighten my hair and curl it and it makes my hair look so shiney.</li>
    <li> I hope Amazon never stops carrying this product!! I have naturally curly hair and this is by far the best product  I have found for use with a flat iron. After drying my hair I section it, then spray a fine mist of the product before using a flat iron. Not only does it leave your hair shiny, it protects your hair from the heat of the flat iron. Not greasy at all</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I first got it from my hair dresser but she stopped carrying it.  I love the smell and it makes my hair which I color very soft and shiney.</li>
    <li> Great product I&#x27;ve used before, but it&#x27;s only sold to the trade.  Love the the scent and the shine it gives.  Plus buying online is such a convenience!</li>
    <li> My first stylist used this on my hair and it makes a world of difference. It always keeps my hair shiny, soft, and straight for up to four days (gross I know)! It&#x27;s a bit pricey but I feel like it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping.  Great product!  Makes my course, frizzy hair smooth and shiny!</li>
    <li> This is my go to for heat styling.  Whenever I flat iron my hair, I spray this first and its shows.  It&#x27;s a lightweight spray that makes your heat styling product more efficient.  Oh yeah,  come to think of it I need more!</li>
    <li> I love this product when I buy it from my salon. The bottle I received from amazon was expired and left my hair looking like I sprayed vaseline on it. I recently read that only professional salons carry prestige products and that when they are sold by any other retailer they are often expired or not the same product at all. Buy at your own risk.</li>
    <li> My hair is curly, coarse and thick. It needs added sheen and definition for the curls to pop. This is one of the few products I&#x27;ve found that gives nice shine, softness AND curl bounce. When you spray it on, just crunch for a few seconds. The shine doesn&#x27;t last forever, but at least a couple of hours. There is no weight to the product, no residue. I just wish it were more accessible and glad I could find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> The best smoother for hair. Doesn&#x27;t feel heavy at ally and smells great. I can&#x27;t go without this product.</li>
    <li> Smooths frizzy ends.  The best I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this!!!</li>
    <li> I love this hair spray as it holds the hair, adds shine but doesn&#x27;t make it greasy or stiff like most hair sprays do.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because of the reviews but honestly I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference after using it.  No shine at all.  I thought I must be imagining.  I sprayed more.  Still no shine.  I do not us a flat iron so I am wondering if it would work better if I did. Hmmmm.</li>
    <li> I love this shine spray, as I spray a little on my hair at the end of styling, and get so many compliments on how my hair looks so shiny and healthy. And, it&#x27;s so much easier to use this Aquage Beyond Shine Spray than using a shine serum product, which can weigh down your hair. I would definitely recommend this product to friends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this in my curly hair and it adds the shine I love.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived on time and securely packaged.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very fine product.</li>
    <li> I asked my hairdresser how he gets my hair so shiny when he does it and he told me he uses Aquage Beyond Shine hairspray.  I tried it and it works!  I love the way it looks and it only takes a very light onceover.  I have straight, silver, shoulder length hair and it looks so healthy and alive.  On Christmas Eve one of my sons complimented my hair and wondered if I had just had it done or something it looked so gorgeous - so it is not just my opinion that this spray really works.  It does not hold the hair stiff, just gives it some control and it has a nice, natural move to it.  I will be buying this from now on.</li>
    <li> Love the shine this spray creates, but not impressed using it with a flat iron.  I suppose it works ok, but I much prefer HSI Professional Argan Oil which allows my flat iron to glide through my hair.</li>
    <li> i absolutely love this stuff! i&#x27;ve been using it for years as a lightweight finishing spray after blow drying that doesn&#x27;t make your hair look greasy. it works great to add a little shine to your ends and keep &amp;#34;fly aways&amp;#34; down or if you don&#x27;t feel like blow drying your hair just spritz a little of this on your wet hair and it will dry without getting frizzy.</li>
    <li> This is the only thing that manages to make my hair shiny without being oily. I use this with my flat iron and I love it.</li>
    <li> Excellent! Best ever had a hard time finding this until now. Does what it is suppose to do I have course hair and it really works!</li>
    <li> I have loved this spray for after i straighten my hair for many years.  It&#x27;s getting more and more difficult to find.  Smells fabulous and leaves shine without weight.</li>
    <li> This product keeps your hair safe from heat and makes it look great. It always make my hair shiny and amazingly soft. After time passes from first spraying this product, hair is still styled. Great product, worth the price!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite products.  I love how it looks on my hair.  I have used this product for several years, and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Living in the south and having naturally wavy, frizzy hair, I&#x27;ve tried my share of products out there to try and tame my doo. This product is the best thing out there to tame fly-aways and keep your hair style in place. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair look oily like some other products I&#x27;ve tried. I spray it on section by section as I flat iron my hair. Then I finish it off with Kenra platinum hair spray no. 26. My hair stays straight and beautiful, even in the worst humidity. Highly recommended! It&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
    <li> Great product. It really makes my hair soft and silky especially since I blow dry and flat iron my hair daily.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It smells fantastic. I discovered that this is the best detangler I have ever used. I spray it on my towel dried hair, and comb through. Plus I get the added benefit of shine. I have thin hair and most shine products make it very flat. I haven&#x27;t found this to be the cast with Aquage.</li>
    <li> great styling product - give one&#x27;s hair so much shine and nice finish ...I use it every day.</li>
    <li> The best for use with flat iron, leaves hair so soft &amp; shiny</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a very long time and have recommended it many time to my friends.  I will order it again,</li>
    <li> Just love this product. I use this product all the time, It smells wonderful. easy to use. leaves your hair looking healthy.</li>
    <li> Love this product, it makes my hair shine.  I&#x27;ve had a lot of compliments on my beautiful hair.</li>
    <li> This spray is great to use before flat ironing your hair.</li>
    <li> This product is great for unruly or frizzy hair. I love it! Don&#x27;t use if you have thin hair, it will make your hair look dirty.</li>
    <li> I straighten my hair almost daily and this product is a great protectant and really helps my iron fuction better.  It&#x27;s not greasey at all and smells amazing.  I get compliments on how good my hair smells regularly after using this product.</li>
    <li> While I adore this for how sleek and soft it makes my hair, it really doesn&#x27;t seem to add anymore shine than my blond locks already has, which was a little disappointing. It does however offer great heat protection and for that I am rating this 4 stars. For shine I would give it more of a 2 star rating.</li>
    <li> I like this spray because it&#x27;s light, not too heavy.  And, it works great at protecting my hair when using a flat iron.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! I have used it many times and have tried other professional products, but I always come back to this one for straightening and shine for my hair.  Love the product!!!</li>
    <li> So awesome I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> This is it! I use the flat iron at least twice a week, and since I started using this, I get compliments on my hair EVERYWHERE, not to mention that my hair looks healthier than ever. This is my second bottle and I know I will continue getting this product for a long time.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser introduced me to this spray and I was awed. Works whether I wear my hair straight or curly. A bit pricey, but worth it.</li>
    <li> Really like this product</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I have used it for years now and have not found anything I like better.  It protects hair from the heat of the flat iron and gives my hair a smooth, sleek shine.  The icing on the cake is that it  has a light fragrance that smells great but doesn&#x27;t clash with my perfume.  I love this product!</li>
    <li> Fabulous hair care.  I am young and have very white hair and this product puts a soft, beautiful shin on my hair, making me look younger and beautiful!  It is worth your weight in gold!  Very hard to find, so thank you AMAZON!</li>
    <li> My hairdresser uses this product on me, and when I saw it on Amazon, I jumped right on it.  It&#x27;s perfect when you want a little shine and natural looking highlight to your hair.  Washes out.  Perfect for an evening out on the town.</li>
    <li> Used one time and someone commented how shiny and beautiful my hair looked! I was surprised. LOVE this product and will continue using. My hair feels much softer as well. Looking forward to trying their other products!</li>
    <li> Loved this for years.  Helps with frizz, provides some shine and smells great.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and love the shine it gives my hair. Aquage has very nice products. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This product really does the trick of controlling my \\&quot;frizzies.\\&quot; My hair is extremely fine, so I have to be careful not to use too much, or my hair ends up looking oily. Great, lightweight, AWESOME-SMELLING, heat protectant. Use it right before my flat iron, and it tames all my flyaways. As long as I use it sparingly, I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> I love this product and have been using it for years.  My hair turned white early and this adds a beautiful natural shine, so much so that some of my friends quit coloring their hair and also went natural.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over five years now and I am so glad I found it on Amazon. Makes my hair shiny and has a great smell to it!</li>
    <li> Weighty, dull and greasy feeling.  I have tried every conceivable way to try this product.  Nothing works.  I get absolutely NO shine at all.  My hair ends up flat and lifeless.  Not something I would recommend.</li>
    <li> It is the only product I can find that adds shine to my hair but is not heavy and weighs down my fine hair.</li>
    <li> Creates shine, smooths fly aways without leaving hair at all oily or greasy and a little does go a long way. Smells heavenly what&#x27;s not to love! I use it as a protectant when flat ironing as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years.  A little goes a long way to add shine to your hair.  I advise to spray your hair in a large room not a small room, because it&#x27;s an aerosol can, you can breath it in. Shipped timely and in good condition.</li>
    <li> I have write hair and this adds that special glisten without making my hair stiff and unmanageable.  I have given as gifts to my friends</li>
    <li> I like this product, even the very strong scent of alchohol is o.k.  It works well, but is sooooo overpriced.</li>
    <li> I love this product on my hair! It makes it shiny without making it look greasy, and even helps me tame my flyaways after I use my straightener. Love it.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not my favorite, but it fades very quickly. Be careful if you spray this in a tiled bathroom... I learned the hard way that when it gets on the bathroom floor, things turn VERY slippery. I am willing to get over that, though, because of how nice my hair looks and feels after using it.</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff - it even makes gray hair shiny! Pricey by my standards, but it works so it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not big on products, but this stuff makes your hair really shiney and smooth. Does not weigh down your hair and does not leave that &amp;#34;Build up- sticky&amp;#34; feeling.</li>
    <li> love this product in my hair! Love the fragrance, too!</li>
    <li> I love this spray. It makes my curly hair so much more manageable to straighten, and leaves it shiny and smelling wonderful. A must have for curly hair. It keeps frizz down all day too! Great price, good purchase. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Loved it.  But the item dissipated in my suitcase.  I think TSA did not like it.</li>
    <li> Aquage Beyond Shine does a great job protecting my hair while using the flat iron. It definitely does leave a healthy looking shine . Great product!&lt;br /&gt;Susan Williams</li>
    <li> Love this product. Makes my hair feel smooth, look shiny, and feels protected against damage from my straightener.</li>
    <li> Great product! Love how it helps make my hair look after using a flat iron.</li>
    <li> I love everything in the aquage line! It smells so wonderful and my hair always feels great! I will continue using this line forever!</li>
    <li> I use it for heat protection when I straighten my hair but I have found that it can build up in my hair if I use too much of it. It smells great though, I always get compliments on how great my hair smells after I&#x27;ve used it, and it makes my hair shiny like when I was a kid (I&#x27;m 32 now and my hair is starting to look a little mousy brown... Not as shiny and bouncy as it used to be). If you use just a little it bounces right back up again. This is a silicone spray so it can weigh your hair down if you use too much, but I haven&#x27;t found another product I like as well as this one for what it is supposed to do, which is make your hair shiny and protect it from the heat. This works well and is salon quality, most professionals I know use it.</li>
    <li> Great smoothing for thick, frizzy hair.  I don&#x27;t feel that it replaces a heat protector, though.  I could be wrong.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I mostly use it prior to straightening my hair, but it&#x27;s good for bringing some life and shine back into dry, damaged hair anytime. It can leave your ends looking greasy if you use too much or spray too close.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by my daughter in law.  I have curly, frizzy color treated hair.  This made it virtually frizz free and very silky and shiny.  I acutally received compliments on my hair.  I had however just had a trim so my hair was healthier.  I went out and bought the whole line, shampoo &amp; conditioner silk thermal line.  Expensive but if it works I don&#x27;t mind paying the price.</li>
    <li> Love these products, wish they weren&#x27;t so costly.</li>
    <li> Works great to keep fly aways and frizz under control.  I used it on wet and dry hair.  For my hair type, naturally curly and fine, it seems to work best when hair is dry, prior to flatiron.</li>
    <li> Aquage Beyond Shine and my flatiron make a spectacular duo in making my hair smooth.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a year, and wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
    <li> I use this product whenever I straighten my hair.  After I blowdry my hair, I separate it into sections and will then spray this to the section I want to get straight and the flat iron does wonders with it.  It does not stick and it smells good too!</li>
    <li> I spray just a small amount in the front of my hair and I can immediately tell a difference.  The hair begins to shine!  No build up</li>
</ol>
