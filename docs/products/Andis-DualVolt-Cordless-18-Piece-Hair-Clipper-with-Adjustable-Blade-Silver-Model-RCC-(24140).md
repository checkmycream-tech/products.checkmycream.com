      <li>and I use this cordless machine mostly in doing the fading!</li>
      <li>love the way this cuts hair!</li>
      <li>its a great product for a super nice price, I would recomend it to everyone that likes good stuff, y</li>
      <li>In the beginning i liked the device because it&#x27;s wireless,</li>

      <li>It all fits in a handy plastic box-durability yet to be determined.</li>

      <li>Own clippers for about a month</li>
      <li>Nice features and attachments.</li>
      <li>no delays and nice</li>
      <li>the positive, it has a really nice case !!</li>
      <li>Cool hair clipper cord/cordless, i am using it at 220 v and it works great.</li>
      <li>It is very easy to use on yourself.</li>
      <li>The plus of this product is a nice clean cut, good battery life between charges.</li>
      <li>She doesn&#x27;t like the feel, and said it&#x27;s too light, couldn&#x27;t get a good control.</li>
      <li>I relied on him for this review and so far what he has told me is that it is THE BEST one they have had yet!</li>
      <li>I received the product, and works great, but it is very, very noisy.</li>
      <li>The cordless feature allowed me to cut my own hair as I can easily manouver the clipper around my hair.</li>
      <li>Maybe the version for horse grooming would work better.</li>
      <li>Took it out of the box, made sure the voltage setting was 110v, plugged it in.</li>
      <li>Love it, but burned-up my 1st one because I forgot to set the correct power when in Europe.</li>
      <li>I have paid more for ones that did not hold a candle to this ones quality.</li>
      <li>I have to run it over many times to get them all.  </li>
      <li>I AM EXTREMELY PLEASED WITH THIS PURCHASE.</li>
      <li>I have had it over a month and was able to use it 3 times to cut my hair on one charge.</li>
      <li>If this Clipper design like Phillip, no need to switch when you go to different country, it will be excellent!</li>
      <li>and  I realy love this product.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t know why people complain about this product I just love</li>
      <li>However, when I travelled overseas and mistakenly tried charging the unit in a 240 volts outlet without switching the transformer appropriately it just stopped charging.</li>
      <li>(Okay 5 or 6.</li>
      <li>If you choose this as an extra clipper, it would be a good choice!!</li>
      <li>Cuts OK but overheats a lot it seems.</li>
      <li>i am satisfied with the purchase.</li>
      <li>I love the fact</li>
      <li>I thought the unit should be more rugged.</li>
      <li>If you partner, the haircut might be even better.</li>
      <li>I read all the specs and was pleased with how these (should have) worked.</li>
      <li>The battery would not hold a charge for more than 15 seconds.</li>
      <li>In reality its more like a backspace then</li>
      <li>Glad I got these, the DVD should help beginners to learn, in just 3 haircuts I will have more than paid for these rather than going to the barber.  </li>
      <li>cordless clipper is balanced OK and fits my hand well.</li>
      <li>way more compact).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But cuts wonderfully and lasts surprisingly long.</li>
      <li>Great product, the quality seems as good or better then other brands.  </li>
      <li>Many people said this thing gets heated up too easy</li>
      <li>Okay, without a guard it works fine, but with the guard I use, 1 inch and 7/8, it cuts nothing.</li>
      <li>Very good clipper especially that its dual voltage.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It is very good.It does not injure my neck during cutting my beard,as othes do.&lt;br /&gt;The only disadvantage it has,is that it cuts the beard no too short,as I expect.</li>
    <li> One of my best purchases on Amazon. I have been using this product for over an year. No complaints, excellent product, battery is great. Have used this to cut my and my sons hairs. All the attachments are of very good quality and fit perfectly. Really happy!</li>
    <li> This clipper is very versatile and can be charged to take outside to trim or cut hair,without leaving a mess inside to clean up. And the hair is good for the grass.</li>
    <li> Took it out of the box, made sure the voltage setting was 110v, plugged it in. Outlet is known good. Nothing happened. Red light didn&#x27;t go on to indicate it was charging. Wall wart didn&#x27;t even get warm after two or three hours. Nothing. Dead On Arrival. Andis needs to work on their quality control.</li>
    <li> I got this clipper because the Wahl I&#x27;ve had for years was taking much to long to cut my hair. Unfortunately the Andis doesn&#x27;t work at all! Okay, without a guard it works fine, but with the guard I use, 1 inch and 7/8, it cuts nothing. Nothing! This thing is junk!!!</li>
    <li> I have been cutting my hair since I can&#x27;t remember, went through a lot of hair clippers, this by far is the worst one I have ever had, motor is very noisy, the clipper guards are very sharp while they are supposed to be radius-ed for comfort, that makes it very uncomfortable to use. used it twice and gave it away. Do not buy it.</li>
    <li> the product is good in use. The best thing i like is the cordless function. once charged it can be used without cord which gives it a tremendous maneuverability. you can trim your back hair on your head too (which i do) and pretty much anywhere. The dual voltage function was the primary reason i purchased this however, i haven&#x27;t been able to use it till now. the cutting is smooth and gives nice outlook.</li>
    <li> This dual voltage hair clipper is one of the best in quality  and  I realy love this product.</li>
    <li> My hair grows fast, and I don&#x27;t wanna grow an afro. I&#x27;ve clipped my own hair with clippers since I was a teen in the 80&#x27;s. This was my first purchase of cordless clippers. I was leery at first, after reading all the reviews of this product. It turned-out to be one of my best purchases to date. I use it to trim my hair and beard weekly, and to cut my mate&#x27;s hair too. It is easy to use, and finally no more cord. Hence, I dub this product, \\&quot;A Man&#x27;s Best Friend\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> This is the first i have used this brand of cutter and was unlucky (so to speak). The cutter ran loud and hot and i have been using cutters for over 20 years and i am telling you this ran hot and loud. It could be that mine was defective but i asked amazon to refund me and not replace the item as i can&#x27;t afford to waste time to encounter the same thing.   the packaging is also misleading. it says it has 18 pieces but it doesn&#x27;t, it has 16 items, not 16 cutting parts. it says it has 8 replaceable teeth and it only has 4. lies lies lies lol.   I have bought other brands that cost way less and were alot quieter and was waaaaaaaaaaay better, i will be heading for one of them brands right now.</li>
    <li> Pros:  - Cordless operation, powerful clippers and good ergonomic design make cutting hair a breeze.  - Wide enough for buzzing hair and accurate enough for cleaning edges and clipping and shaping beards.  - Excellent battery life.  I&#x27;ve cut my hair and trimmed my beard 4 times over a month without recharging.    Cons:  - Make sure you clean and oil blades after each use or the blades will get hot enough to hurt sensitive skin.  - After about 3 months of use, they stopped working, just died, in the middle of use.  I disassembled them and found a wire to the motor had broken at the power switch.  The unit has NO strain relief for the internal wiring and this allows the wires to vibrate enough to eventually break at their solder joints.  Resoldered, applied some silicon goop for strain relief and we were good to go again.</li>
    <li> The kit does include 18 pieces.  Yes, I agree that some of the pieces do not seem to be substantial -- but they do count.  I am sure that Amazon.com will make it right if your kit is missing parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  1 clipper&lt;br /&gt;  1 charger&lt;br /&gt;  1 blade guard&lt;br /&gt;  8 attachment combs&lt;br /&gt;  1 How-to-DVD&lt;br /&gt;  1 scissors&lt;br /&gt;  1 comb&lt;br /&gt;  1 cape&lt;br /&gt;  1 cleaning brush&lt;br /&gt;  1 oil&lt;br /&gt;  1 storage case&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cordless clippers use a DC motor and should not be loud.  Clippers shouldn&#x27;t get more than just warm after several minutes of use or charging.  If they are loud or hot, they are defective and they need to be replaced.  These clippers have a five year manufacturers warranty.  If they are defective when they are received, Amazon.com will replace them, and they pay for shipping both ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea what the 4 vs. 8 replaceable teeth issue is about, I didn&#x27;t see anything like that mentioned in the Amazon.com description or on the manufacturer&#x27;s web site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My problem with these clippers is that they are made in China; the other Andis products that I have bought were American made.</li>
    <li> The battery would not hold a charge for more than 15 seconds. Returned it.</li>
    <li> It really doesn&#x27;t stay charged very long. I always have to recharge it during use.</li>
    <li> First one we tried turned burning hot after 3 min of use. We thought we might have gotten a lemon and exchanged a new unit. the second one had the same issue and also was very loud, too. Also some attachment had crooked teeth. Thanks to Amazon that I could return it! I am very disappointed with Andis and will never buy this brand again.</li>
    <li> Good machine till now. I have used it just once and it worked good over two heads te same day.</li>
    <li> The product worked very well. The cordless feature allowed me to cut my own hair as I can easily manouver the clipper around my hair. However, when I travelled overseas and mistakenly tried charging the unit in a 240 volts outlet without switching the transformer appropriately it just stopped charging. I thought the unit should be more rugged. I have tried everything to get it to continue charging but to no avail. When I checked the power output from the charger, it still reads 7.8 volts, but the red and green light which should come up when you are charging the clipper are not coming up. Does anyone have an idea what i should do?</li>
    <li> Smooth running and I like it because I can use it w/Barbados&#x27; Elec, Cycles which I wasn&#x27;t able to use my other shaver because of the horrible noise.</li>
    <li> Does a great job. Not quite as close of a cut as I had hoped for but a very good product. I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for nearly 20 years, and have been completely satisfied with inexpensive clippers from Whal in the past.  However, I needed a dual-voltage unit as I now work overseas for half the year and I purchased this Andis unit for that reason.  It is completely unusable!  First, as several others have noted it is loud and the cutting head gets hot enough to burn your skin.  In addition, your hairs can get caught between the plastic blade guards and the blades - getting pulled out instead of cut - painful!  Furthermore, the plastic guards are brittle and easily broken plus the points are not properly rounded so you end up stabbing yourself with them. One of these would be a terrible design flaw, but this many in one product?  These clippers should be pulled off the market!</li>
    <li> no base came with the trimmer as shows in the instructions sheet  and the wire barely fits in the charging slot... the light indicators don&#x27;t work well eirher so thought it was charged and couldn&#x27; t use use it again&lt;br /&gt;my kids found the box useful</li>
    <li> My teenage son is learning how to cut his own hair and he&#x27;s likes how they handle...</li>
    <li> The battery has some issues, doesn&#x27;t work when is not connected to electricity</li>
    <li> Great product, the quality seems as good or better then other brands.  I love the fact it comes with a case and no cord</li>
    <li> The power button is smooth.  Which makes it hard to use when you want to turn on or off the cutter, even when the hand is dry.  This needs to be redesigned with groves to provide grip.  I used a file to cut my own groves.  Otherwise the cutter is works fine.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really powerful and convenient. The comb fits well on the clippers for a smooth finish.</li>
    <li> The most annoying thing about this is the enormous and rapid heating&lt;br /&gt;But overall it performs good, sharp and smooth</li>
    <li> I needed a dual voltage, practical beard trimmer for close trimming and this andis does the job. Comb attachments do not work as well. If you are planning to use the trimmer for haircuts, consider investing in more professional products with individual ceramic blade attachments.</li>
    <li> So the item i got was good, it works great its a good hair clipper. My only problem was there was NO CLIPPER OIL OR MINI BRUSH!!! that pissed me off. How do u miss items in your retail box?!?! bogus</li>
    <li> I like this razor a lot.  Finally I can trim my head and beard in the shower instead of making a huge mess in the sink and on the floor!  Great power and does not bog down in wet or dirty hair.  The battery also lasts for many haircuts and will operate plugged in while it is charging if it dies mid trim.  There are a couple of things I don&#x27;t like about it though.  First the guards are very sharp and hurt my skin compared to other brands.  Second there are fewer teeth than other brands meaning that it leaves more stray hairs when buzzing my head.  I have to run it over many times to get them all.  My old cheapo conair clippers had many more teeth and did not leave so many strays.  The multiple runs required with painful guards make using this a rather unpleasant experience sometimes.</li>
    <li> Son likes it a lot and is the one I got it for.</li>
    <li> YOU CANNOT USE IT AS IT GETS HOT IN FEW SECONDS...IT WILL BURN YOUR SKIN. BUT AT LEAST IT RUNS SMOOTH. DO NOT BUY</li>
    <li> It works as described, I have been using it for more than a year now and the only problem I have is that it gets a little noise from time tom time when it gets a little loose.</li>
    <li> A piece of junk.  The battery charge is not enough for a full haircut and the battery pins broke after it was charged a couple of times.  This is a very poor excuse for a hair cutter.</li>
    <li> For the price these clippers are perfect. Just enough to touch up your head from time to time</li>
    <li> cordless is the way to go. no tangled cords to deal with or knots and the cord knocking stuff over in my tiny bathroom. it does take some thinking ahead though, such as charging it ahead of time before you start cutting. it can heat up but that only really matters if you are cutting the hair of multiple people. i am satisfied with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I am very happy the boring wires are removed. It gave me no pain while cutting my hair. It&#x27;s quite a convenient device.</li>
    <li> The plus of this product is a nice clean cut, good battery life between charges. The minus is it&#x27;s very noisy. So loud that it painful to your ears.</li>
    <li> There was a problem with delivery... supervisor from Knickernocker Post Office emailed me that the Church Street Post Office must be saying they attempted delivery and are not even transferriing the items to the local PO for customer pick-up. It was stressful at best and I even recruited a friend of mine that happens to be a Postal Supervisor to no avail.  It is a sad state of the Post Office ... I even called the church street PO and they hung up on me 5 times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just got notification that it was sent back finally to the original sender!</li>
    <li> These are good, just a little heavy and loud. Im use to professional ones but i didnt want to spend the money on professional ones for home use.</li>
    <li> WELL I AM FAMILIAR WITH ANDIS PRODUCTS THAT&#x27;S WHY I JUMP IN AND GOT THIS ONE FOR MY SELF. ANDIS TO HAIR IS LIKE SWISS TO TIME. THEY WHERE MADE FOR USE NOT JUST ANOTHER SHAVER FOR THE DRAWER.</li>
    <li> Great feel!  It has a balanced weight when it&#x27;s in your hands.  The only downside is that the blades get very very hot while in use.  Oiling the blades and using Cool Lube helps a little but it would behoove you to have a second clipper as a backup, just in case!  One full charge of the battery will last through a days of worth of cutting.  If you choose this as an extra clipper, it would be a good choice!!</li>
    <li> It workded here in the U.S,. but when I took it to a foreign country that had 240 voltage, it didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my son so I can&#x27;t really say one way or the other but I haven&#x27;t heard any complaints from him</li>
    <li> good but after its fully charged battery died sooner than expected.</li>
    <li> Love this, charge lasts a long time, cuts close.</li>
    <li> I bought this looking for an all around trimmer, with sharp blades and close quarter capabilities like around the ears or beard trimming, and something that could be cordless for maneuverability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The blades hotter than all hell. Its wasn&#x27;t running for even a minute while knocking back the sideburns and I couldn&#x27;t get it anywhere near my face to trim up the mustache or the neck line. I&#x27;m talking red hot!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The blades don&#x27;t get close enough to the skin, and do a horrible job cleaning up the neck line, around the ears, and a &amp;#34;zero&amp;#34; trim job. It left more than a weeks worth of stubble. I can settle for &amp;#34;5 o&#x27;clock shadow&amp;#34; look , but &amp;#34;hobo&amp;#34; wasn&#x27;t cutting for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.There is no indicator to tell if it&#x27;s fully charged, OR if it&#x27;s almost dead. Yes there are lights on it, RED when you plug it in, RED when using it in the ON position, and RED as it fades out, almost out of nowhere, which brings me to...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. No too sure on actual battery life because I only used it 2 or 3 times in the course of 2 weeks. I can only assume it was fully charged, seeing how I left it plugged in to charge overnight, but it sure didn&#x27;t last long compared to the one it was replacing due to age and missing parts. Nonetheless, after lubing it, and slightly loosening the blade screws to help it slide better, it got a little more RPM out of it (which made more heat) but it went from ON, to slowing, to DEAD, in a matter of seconds. No fade out, no warning, no flashing lights, just DEAD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. It was not very sharp. Not only did it not cut very close, but for being brand new, I expected this thing to cut like a fresh razor, and even aired on the cautious side as not to get bit by it, but I was thoroughly disappointed on how lazily it did cut. took a few passes to clean up even the already short hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Worst blade guide setup I&#x27;ve ever seen. Usually you&#x27;d see a #1, #2, #3 etc all the way through #6 or higher, but this does it by fraction of an inch! 3/16&amp;#34;, 1/4&amp;#34;, 1/8&amp;#34; and so on, but side by side they all look the same!! Nothing like some trial and error, and eventually shaving off the beard to find out that you picked the wrong one because you thought a 1/4&amp;#34; would be sufficient and it turned out to be stubble length. In reality its more like a backspace then a height.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. The sharpest part of the whole kit were the plastic guides!! It was like dragging shredded plastic shards across my face and neck. I actually caught a corner and it broke skin. I don&#x27;t mean to come off as a buffoon, or inept. I am a pretty hairy guy and know my way around a trimmer or 3 (Okay 5 or 6. Shut up.) and I am plenty coordinated, and have been doing my own haircuts for several years. These plastic edges though are like CNC milled to Wolverine adamantium, razor sharp tolerances, and make your face and neck look like you just got in a fight with a stray Tom cat. Not the look I was going for either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Just a side note, TIGHTENING the blade screws only create even MORE heat due to the increased pressure they put on each other to slide back and forth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and buy a GOOD one. Don&#x27;t let the decent reviews fool you. If you want a good trimmer, this aint it. The best part about the whole kit was the little plastic box it came in to keep all the stuff together in storage.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for over a year, still going great.  Nothing but to say all good things about it.</li>
    <li> This is the second pair of this model of Andis clippers that I purchased. The first lasted at least three years until the battery stopped holding a charge. They are very well made. Being cordless makes them very convenient. The blades never got dull and they are very reasonably priced. I would highly recommend them to the do it yourself barber.</li>
    <li> the clipper is quite good and has a good battery life. However the buzz sound and heat on the clipper blade are the cons.</li>
    <li> wouldn&#x27;t even cut the hair on my face , overpriced junk !</li>
    <li> I travel a lot in foreign countries and this is useful for keeping me groomed.  It does not do a good job of lining up but it is not a precision instrument.  I use it to cut my hair and trim my beard but it is a complete failure for use as liner.  But it is difficult to find a dual voltage clipper so I am very grateful for this product.</li>
    <li> THESE SUCK. GETS SKIN BURNING HOT IN 2 MINUTES AND YOU HAVE TO STOP USING THEM. DO NOT BUY NOPE</li>
    <li> Would not recommend these clippers they are extremely loud and annoying to other customers and employees! The charge only seems to last for one haircut before the die out! The silver coating started to wear and peel off after the first haircut! Not happy with this purchase at all!</li>
    <li> The Clipper is good, the battery last for full barbing session if it is fully charged but it doesn&#x27;t give a smooth skin barbing for me. As I usually skin barb leaving no hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for our trip to Ireland two weeks before we traveled, and was excited that I was going to have a trimmer for my facial hair. Charged it up and tried to use it - it did not cut at all! I was so disappointed, because I looked unshaven the entire trip. The pictures we took will always remind me that this clipper was a complete waste of money. And to top it off, we just got back on 7-14-13...one of the first things we did was attempt to process the return on Amazon, and we were ONE DAY past the return time - now we are stuck with this piece of garbage????&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish the reseller would make it right.</li>
    <li> Was a gift for my bf he was happy</li>
    <li> I bought this because of what was said about how it works, and the fact that you can charge it, the only problems it has,&lt;br /&gt;It heats up very fast and you can&#x27;t use it on more than one person. It hard to handle when hot because it burning the skin of the person you are using it on. Using it when it charged does help much it takes a few minutes and the battery goes down.&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t recommend anyone to buy it.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my daughter to use in China.  Shipped  it to her and it started smoking ---- does not work.  A waist of money.  Am not going to pay the expensive shipping fee to see it back.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This worked well enough.  I noticed my plug in looks different than what is shown, but it worked fine.  So no big deal.  I wish the gaurdless option got closer, I&#x27;d really like something like the professionals use in a salon.  This doesn&#x27;t seem to pull and handles great w/o a cord!</li>
    <li> I bought this Andis Duel Volt clipper for my wife. She is a professional hair stylist and she loves it. It cuts wet or dry hair equally well. The charge lasts well beyond anticipation. I read some negative rewiews amd all I can say is \\&quot;They did not read the instructions\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Please note - there is a tiny switch on the black box you plug into the wall!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is tiny and very easy to miss (as I did and blew up the converter). I misunderstood that the clippers would work under both conditions of 120-240V as your charger for your phone or laptop would work. I read all the specs and was pleased with how these (should have) worked. I went to plug it in and POP - I &#x27;let the smoke out&#x27; of the box.  Only when I pulled the plug out of the wall did I notice that there was a little, tiny switch that was not delineated with a sticker or anything, and was even black &amp; flush with the box, which I don&#x27;t believe most people would notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to rate as 1-star because it essentially was a waste of my money unfortunately.&lt;br /&gt;Cannot speak to the quality of the clippers, but can speak to the horrible quality of the electrical planning of the adapter/converter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware &amp; triple-check before plugging in.</li>
    <li> There is a switch on the adapter to switch the different voltage,  but sometime forgot to switch it. If this Clipper design like Phillip, no need to switch when you go to different country, it will be excellent!</li>
    <li> Dropped it once and thats all it took. But cuts wonderfully and lasts surprisingly long. Just dont drop the damned thing cos its made of really cheap plastic. Had to buy another and use the old for parts.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t use it because the electricity sit as110 and I used it in 220</li>
    <li> While this gadget was working it was fine....unfortunately that only lasted a few times and after I took it to Thailand (and used it without any problem), the next time I tried it the red/green lights would not come on when I plugged it in to the wall-- essentially it will not charge even with the cord and it no longer works at all. And too bad I can&#x27;t send it back now as I&#x27;m on the other side of the world!</li>
    <li> the battery life is too short and when it is being charged, the green light is on always since start charging.the green light should be on only when it is fully charged.</li>
    <li> Was hoping I could have gotten a set of sizers for it to cut certain hair lengths. Sizers not mentioned in the description &amp; not offered on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Love it, but burned-up my 1st one because I forgot to set the correct power when in Europe. Power is not automatic &amp; the 220 setting must be manually selected/switched.</li>
    <li> Very good clipper especially that its dual voltage. You can switch between 120v and 220v. The one thing that could be a bit annoying is that the clipper heads are kinda harsh for the skin, a bit too sharp. Other than that its perfect, love its power and sound.</li>
    <li> I bought this primarily for travel because of it&#x27;s dual voltage capability.  While it is indeed dual voltage it has a manual switch on the VERY heavy transformer to switch between 110/220.  The weight of the transformer is disappointing as it the manual switch rather than just adapting to voltage like most modern electronics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case is super cheap and doesn&#x27;t stay latched very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, not great for my travel needs, but as an electric razor it works fine.  The depth guards stay on reasonably well. The battery lasts several days.</li>
    <li> In the beginning i liked the device because it&#x27;s wireless, After few months of use, the power button failed although i&#x27;m my use is not that frequent and i&#x27;m no longer able to use it.</li>
    <li> I AM EXTREMELY PLEASED WITH THIS PURCHASE. IT WORK BETTER THAN A PLUG TYPE I HAD OWNED PREVIOUSLY..</li>
    <li> Glad I got these, the DVD should help beginners to learn, in just 3 haircuts I will have more than paid for these rather than going to the barber.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Quality of this andis is not so good ! I trim only one time my hair and battery its all ready dead ! And its too loud while triming ..</li>
    <li> The first pair I ordered overheated- I picked the clippers up about 4 hours into charging them and they were really hot-almost hot enough to burn a person and noticed that they had split where the silver and black parts meet and even melting a bit- they wouldn&#x27;t even turn on. I went ahead and exchanged them for a second pair. The second pair worked for a few seconds before dying when I turned them on before charging. After charging all night turned they turned on for a few seconds then died. I tried charging again for a few more hours in case they hadn&#x27;t been plugged into the charger correctly, but still they didn&#x27;t hold a charge.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice hair clipper set. It is cordless or you can use with a cord.  I needed one to replace a bed head one that keeps having charging up issues.  This one is very good. Great purchase and good&lt;br /&gt;Price too.</li>
    <li> its a great product for a super nice price, I would recomend it to everyone that likes good stuff, y</li>
    <li> even with oil before got hot during use of only 15 minutes almost burned me - who heard of oiling during the first 15 minutes never had to do this with walh or conair and I&#x27;ve been buzzing my hair since 1985. would never buy this brand again.</li>
    <li> Great clippers love the fact that it&#x27;s cordless and dual voltage I travel frequently and need to be able to charge it when away</li>
    <li> TG someone came up with a cordless hair clippers. And the tell you the real deal as to why clippers stop working, in their instruction manual. Upon using the clippers with a number 1 attachment, I noticed how difficult it was to maneuver it across my scalp!</li>
    <li> Ni-CAD Battery won&#x27;t hold a charge.  Charged it fully once and turned it on to test if it had worked.  A few weeks later, I used it for a haircut and it turned on for 20 seconds before the battery drained...the clipper slowed down til it stopped indicating the battery needs recharging.  I recharged it again.  Same thing.  Battery is defective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suspect that the culprit is the Ni-CAD batteries.  I kick myself for not looking into this in detail.  Who uses Ni-CAD today?  As an avid Ni-CAD RC car enthusiast growing up, the short end of using these technology is that there is a lost in battery memory and quickly degrades if you charge the battery before it fully drains.  However, my unit should never had this issue as I charged it once out of the box after noting that it would not power on (indicating a drained battery).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those looking for a cordless trimmer/clipper, make sure you get one that uses either NiMH or LiON batteries which are superior by comparison (and way more compact).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit does not work when plugged in which would had been a great feature when you run out of juice or when you have a defective unit like mine.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as other Andis models, but it&#x27;s still good in my opinion. Besides, the wireless feature is a total plus for this product.</li>
    <li> It really gets hot and very quickly.  You need to constantly oil the blades and have to use a shield to prevent clipper burn.  I would not recommend it .On the positive, it has a really nice case !!</li>
    <li> I got this  clipper for my friend in Cuba, and I hope she also will like it .....&lt;br /&gt;To me it looks good, thanks.</li>
    <li> I was excited when I got the clippers because they arrived sooner than expected.  But when I plugged them in to use them with the cord, I smelled a burning residue and quickly unplugged the clippers.  I put the power supply (battery) up to my nose and instantly was disappointed to smell that the power supply smelled like it had been fried.  I waited two days and plugged the power supply back into the wall with the clippers and got nothing.  I never even got a chance to use them.  I now have to look at other potential products that I can use while i&#x27;m deployed in Afghanistan and not only wait for them to get here, but hope that they will work once I get them.  It&#x27;s very frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jc</li>
    <li> It is very heavy to carry around while traveling. The most dissapointing thing is you can not return it if you are not happy with it. You are stuck !</li>
    <li> If works well, however it is much louder than any other clippers that I have used in the past .</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s wireless the plus but my wife  (my barber) doesn&#x27;t like it. She doesn&#x27;t like the feel, and said it&#x27;s too light, couldn&#x27;t get a good control.</li>
    <li> Many people said this thing gets heated up too easy but mine works just fine and don&#x27;t get that much hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why people complain about this product I just love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And you don&#x27;t complain about this much of quality if you think about how much you&#x27;ve paid for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product.</li>
    <li> I received the product, and works great, but it is very, very noisy. Not sure if my product is faulty, but...</li>
    <li> Not as strong as clippers that are wired</li>
    <li> In general. Mute, fairly easy to use. Less than Philips work a bit rough, accessories.</li>
    <li> Our base has only one barber/hairdresser. It takes 4-6 weeks to get an appointment to get rather expensive haircut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So long as you are not impatient you can give yourself an acceptable haircut -although the back of the neck is anyone&#x27;s guess. If you partner, the haircut might be even better. Admittedly, our local standards are not overly high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The DVD gives basic instruction but most people can just remember their last few hundred haircuts and do OK even without the DVD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cordless clipper is balanced OK and fits my hand well. The assortment of clipper guards allows you to control how much you take off and avoid a skin head unless that&#x27;s what you intended. The recharger works quickly. It all fits in a handy plastic box-durability yet to be determined. I bought mine after borrowing a friend&#x27;s same model for a trial run.</li>
    <li> The Andis 24140 has met all of my expectations. I use it to trim my hair to a (0) hair length level. The trimmer arrived exactly on time, 3 days I recall. Product was in original box unopened. I charged the trimmer overnight and then used it the next day. Worked just great. Some reviews stated that the trimmer blades got hot. Well... It does get warm, but nowhere near any level of concern. Not quite sure how long the battery will last. I usually charge the trimmer the night before I use it. I know for fact it can be used for two consecutive trims without any problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charger was the only reason I did not give the trimmer a full five stars. It&#x27;s not a big deal, but you have to manually set a slide switch to either 120 or 240VAC power. For guys like me that do a lot of international travel, that could be a problem. Forget to set the thing to 240VAC while in Europe and who knows what will happen (pow !! ??).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I could not be any happier. The vendor promptly notifies me when the product shipped including the FedEx tracking number.</li>
    <li> Cuts OK but overheats a lot it seems. Should have stuck with a Wahl but was tempted by the cordless feature</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a sharp clean cut, the clippers only works well for trimming not for lining.  Maybe they just need to be adjusted</li>
    <li> This hair clipped included everything you need to cut hair, yours or someone else&#x27;s. It is very easy to use on yourself. There are enough attachments to get just the right length of hair cut that you desire. The charge lasts a long  time. The head does get warm, but there are enough warnings, and it does cool down quickly. Great grip.</li>
    <li> love the way this cuts hair! the down side theres not really a varity of attachments, and it doesnt fit universal attachments that i already have so now im on the search for guards.</li>
    <li> The clipper arrived fast and was exactly what I needed here. I have had it over a month and was able to use it 3 times to cut my hair on one charge. The fourth time it still appeared to have more than enough charge to do the job, but I charged it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great, very pleased.</li>
    <li> Cuts good.  Charger has a 120 or 240V switch.  The one purchased battery lasts for 1 heavy head of hair with some reserve or two thinner heads of hair.  The blades get hot; use the guards. Loads of guard sizes. Only thing I think ANDIS needs to do is make it quieter...Please?</li>
    <li> Product was delivered on time and in good condition but quality was all so poor. Looks really cheap from a parts and design stand point. Looks different from the impression created by the display photos. Very noisy and heats up very quickly.</li>
    <li> These are the second pair I have owned, the first fell off the bathroom counter and broke hitting something else.  They work great and stay sharp if you perform the necessary maintenance on them that is required.</li>
    <li> first of all , I would thank the seller for using Aramex for shipping, my order was feb 8 and I recieved it on feb 12.&lt;br /&gt;(notice that, I&#x27;m in Saudi Arabia!.. 4 days only!!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;second, I used the clipper yasterday and it was fantastic , easy to use and fast. it was the fastest shaving I ever did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the cordless clipper gives me the freedom to move and reach some hard place in my head!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you again. I recommed to buy from this seller</li>
    <li> Andis has created a product that works great. Also I dont have to worry about the warranty as it is a 5 year warranty. I&#x27;ve used these while traveling in Europe and the states, compact and holds its charge for a long time.</li>
    <li> I cannot get it to recharge.  It will only work when plugged in.  I thought it would recharge if I drained it completely but even that is no longer working.</li>
    <li> While I know and trust the Andis brand, this has got to be the worst clipper I&#x27;ve run across.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the cordless version Andis due to the pricing, and advertised run time of one hour. I figured that would be plenty of buzz time for me. I followed the initial recommended charge time of 16 hours (not kidding here, really recommends 16 hour initial charge) only to get 10 minutes of run time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For fit and finish, the design, is very comfortable and does feel solid. Good marks on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades needed to be fine tuned to adjust the cutting edge, in itself not a deal breaker. But getting back to the run time, this product seems to only want to deliver about 15% of the cutting time advertised.  Trying another full charge to see if the Andis Dual Voltage can earn a spot in my Clipper Inventory. I so wanted to like this one!! Maybe the version for horse grooming would work better.</li>
    <li> Blades could be a little sharper but can&#x27;t complain for the price. I use it every day to cut my hair and beard and its still going strong two years later! If it broke tomorrow I would buy it again!</li>
    <li> I really like this clipper!  I&#x27;m a professional hairdresser and I use this cordless machine mostly in doing the fading! its worth the money! it does the job! Very light!</li>
    <li> Great product. Works as advertised.  DVD is outdated, but still good for showing the basics.  Everything you need is included</li>
    <li> Exact and fast shipping..no delays and nice</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son who is a Marine and frequently travels all over the world. Most of the time they rely on each other for their haircuts as a barber is not always conveniently located or they are in the field. I relied on him for this review and so far what he has told me is that it is THE BEST one they have had yet! I purchased the Insten Universal World Wide Travel Charger Adapter Plug, to go with it simply because of the variety of plugs they encounter in their travels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s : Dual Voltage, Cordless, Charges Quickly, Exceptional Quality, Very Durable (considering his platoon has two they are constantly using and NEVER had an issue to date.) They liked it so much that they own two and are purchasing a few more so each squad has one.&lt;br /&gt;Charges great even on a generator!&lt;br /&gt;The price is excellent! I have paid more for ones that did not hold a candle to this ones quality. I wont make that mistake again. Marine tested and approved !!!</li>
    <li> Right on time.  Exactly what I needed in order to make the project I was working on work.  Will do it again.</li>
    <li> we replace one we have used for 20 years and this one seems like a dream come true.  Very easy to use and does a great job.</li>
    <li> This item is great to have on a deployment when you need to cut your own hair. Holds a charge for a long time at least 2 hours or more and they&#x27;re adjustable as well. Great product to have on any deployment.</li>
    <li> takes longer to cut hair than I thought, even with short hair to start with, really messy. like the cordless though</li>
    <li> Cool hair clipper cord/cordless, i am using it at 220 v and it works great. Be  careful in switching the voltage key</li>
    <li> Fantastic bargan &amp; definitely a saving instead if the barber shop. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I NEED A REPLACEMENT CORD TO CHARGE THE CLIPPER</li>
    <li> we had to return this since it was bigger than we thought it was, but always happy with Andis products. They work well, hold a charge for a long time and durable.</li>
    <li> Own clippers for about a month and I have no issues except very loud, but cut pretty good...I would recommend clippers to others</li>
    <li> Versatile and easy to hold. Will come in handy on extended international vacations. Nice features and attachments. A good value for the money.</li>
    <li> I was deployed and cut my hair weekly. I even bummed it out to a few friends. It only lasted 6 months which was sad. First the handle on the side broke so I had to glue the bottom part in place, then it stopped moving so halfway through deployment it was dead.</li>
    <li> Too loud and the blades get hot very fast won&#x27;t hold a charge. I do like the sleek design and the power button being on the side</li>
</ol>
