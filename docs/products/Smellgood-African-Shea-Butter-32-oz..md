<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This shea butter is good for moisturizing but it is not processed correctly. I was expecting it to be nice and fluffy but it&#x27;s not, It&#x27;s lumpy and has a stronger oder than the grade A stuff.</li>
    <li> It meets all my needs it is a great product thanks. Again</li>
    <li> Great product. smell good :)</li>
    <li> excellent product!!!!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty grainy.  I prefer a smoother Shea Butter,  won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I buy from this sell every time I need a new batch. The service is amazing, ships right away, and the shea butter is always a smooth consistency.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a loyal customer.</li>
    <li> There isn&#x27;t much to say other than this stuff is great! I made a whipped shea butter for the body and another one for hair and I barely put a dent in it.  It will probably last for well over a year.</li>
    <li> great product for value</li>
    <li> I have been a pure shea butter user for years. I always heard how it can prevent stretch marks while pregnant.I always used it as my moisterizer. I use it at night because it is a little greasy. If I use it during the day after my shower I wipe down my body with a towel then use a scented moisturizer. Well I am 7 months pregnant and use this product religiously. I was 112 lbs now I weigh 160. I have not a one stretch mark yet. I also use Alba kakui nut oil from Amazon while my skin is damp after my shower. My skin does not itch from stretching at all. I love shea butter. I only use raw organic. I love this product. It comes in a yellow color or ivory. I love the ivory color because the yellow shea can get on your clothes. It wont stain them but if you make the mistake I did u will have yellow streaks on your shirt and have to run home to change. Both are excellent but the ivory seems to be more silky as u have to scrape it out of the container. The ivory also has a better scent. I will keep ordering the ivory shea. Thank you Amazon for having this wonderful product delivered to my door and for a great price. I was at Whole foods market and saw raw shea butter ivory scented with oils. For a tiny jar and mean tiny it cost 20.00. You can make your own. I just ordered essential oil package from Amazon and cant wait to.experiment in my kitchen with the scented oils and the ivory shea. I am going to put the shea butter in my mixer and infuse the scented oil into it. Something fun to do as I am on bed rest. Hope this helps. Hooray for organic raw shea.</li>
    <li> Not very satisfied since the plastic box that the product arrived in was already broken . For the shea butter I already did body butter and it came out good but I dont have anything to compare it to.</li>
    <li> I use this Shea Butter product every time I twist my daughter&#x27;s hair and it has definitely kept her hair WELL moisturized and hold the twists a lot longer.</li>
    <li> The best skin care ever.</li>
    <li> I love this brand of Shea Butter and this is the best value for your money. I use this for making my own body butter and hair moisturizer!!!</li>
    <li> Good but I don&#x27;t like how it on your clothes</li>
    <li> Tried using it to make a whipped Shea Butter and my butter came off grainy and its smell overwhelmed the many essential oils I placed in it to make it smell better - to no resolve. I hope that I can find some way to make this LARGE tub usable. It&#x27;s ridiculous. I wish I could find a way to make this worth the price.</li>
    <li> This is a great product with many uses and benefits. It does not smell fantastic but the scent wears off quickly while the moisture remains. It does not conflict with any other product so feel free to smell beautiful with a spritz of body spray,  cologne, or perfume. My skin has definitely improved in the way it looks and feels. I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I would&#x27;ve given 5 stars but my container was cracked open when I received my package in the mail. Luckily I had an old container of my own to transfer the rest in, but other than that everything else is fine.</li>
    <li> Wonderful. Leaves my skin feeling soft and well nourished. I will buy this again. The quality of this product was above my expectations</li>
    <li> African work as I expect it to work. Wonderful product</li>
    <li> Luv this product! I add some jojoba oil to it to thin it out a bit for less thick application</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I use it for skin moisturizer, lip-balm, &amp; scalp conditioner. I&#x27;m African American, it&#x27;s great for beginners going natural hair hairstyles or regimen.. Also it doesn&#x27;t look that big on amazon, but trust its plenty and worth $.</li>
    <li> very good product and was delivered on time.</li>
    <li> Wonderful!  I made many hair treatrments with this one.  Although I will shop elsewhere because they raised the price - not good!</li>
    <li> I am not a shea expert but from what i read and seen its the real deal. I use it for my hair. Being that my hair is natural and i being african american my hair seems to love it. Wayyyyy less ichy after having my braids up. My skin loves it as well.</li>
    <li> Shea Butter has always been a great product for your skin.  The package was delivered in a timely manner and was what I expected..  I highly recommend Shea Butter to all whose skin is rough and dry.  Also, to those whose skin maintains moisture, 100% Shea Butter beats lotion that only has a certain percentage of Shea Butter on it..  Great product!!!</li>
    <li> My Shea butter arrived quickly. It is great for my daughter and I because we both have dry skin. Shea butter is great in the winter.</li>
    <li> I use this every night before bed and my skin has never looked better. Heat it up in the microwave for 20 seconds and it becomes an oil that&#x27;s easily applied to the skin. Will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Newbie to natural hair , using this product with  coconut oil , and rosemary . So far my hair is loving it .</li>
    <li> This tub of Shea Butter is HUGE... should last me awhile.. Only took two days for the product to arrive.. I love this African Shea Butter and all it&#x27;s benefits</li>
    <li> Just love this Shea Butter and my order came really fast I need to order 3 more</li>
    <li> I like this product and even shared it with my hairdresser.  The only problem I had was with packaging.  As stated by another customer, my container came cracked &amp; shea butter was hard.  However, since others on youtube had mentioned this, I also ordered almond, coconut, and peppermint oil to mix with it to make it smooth enough for hair or skin.</li>
    <li> I usually get this or this type of product and I am usually satisfied with the product, but this product when I received it was clumped in batches in a 64 Oz jar, when I specifically ordered a 32 Oz jar.  When I opened the product it seemed stale or old and hard I will order this type of product but not this not worth the price.</li>
    <li> This is NOT 100% Shea Butter, definitely mixed the shea butter with something, Im african and i have using shea butter for a while now; I definitely know the difference. I just wasted my money, dont even know if I should apply this to my skin</li>
    <li> i sometimes wonder the authencity of this shea butter. They talk about the properties that help for skin, hair, burns and so on and forth. i tell you this shea butter only helps dry skin and you have to use it generously all over your body for it to work.  Not buying this again.</li>
    <li> This is okay have not seen much difference between this product and lotion. Not sold by this product just yet!</li>
    <li> Apparently this isn&#x27;t real shea butter...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I regret ordering this and in the future will only be ordering the pure, beige/white shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO when it arrived the lid was cracked and it was a greasy mess that I was disappointed in.</li>
    <li> Every where I have gone I have not got a deal like this for a 32oz of Shea Butter. Love it!</li>
    <li> Very very soft, not as hard as other beauty store ones that i felt were more refined (even though they smelt better) and hard to blend. It blended well with my lotion and other oils.</li>
    <li> Great product,  woorks very well. Worth the money. Shipping was fast and packaged well.</li>
    <li> I thought all 100% shea butters were the same.  This one performed as well as the previous one I purchased, however, this one did not have the same creamy consistency.  There were small lump in the product but they did melt once I rub it between my fingers prior to applying it to my body.</li>
    <li> This stuff is way greasy and do not see any results whatsoever. Total waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;If you are going to try it plan on wearing it at nightime only since you will look like a grease ball!</li>
    <li> I have no idea as I am going to return it. It arrived with a crack in the bottom and the top rim was broken off so that the lid did not fit tightly, and the so called butter inside is as hard as a candle and it does not smell good at all. You must have a review so here it is.</li>
    <li> it was a great yellow, like normal and filled with no hollows. when i ordered it again it was intense yellow and has alot of hollows, blanks that means not filled totally, and the size is smaller than usual but its not obvious on the pic!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great for dry skin, leaves your skin very smooth, I am very happy with the results, I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I really like using shea butter.  With this quantity, I can mix other items with this for my skin and hair.</li>
    <li> Super disappointed to receive a clear plastic deli container of a semi-solid oil that had gone bad. I immediately emailed the seller and in broken engrish he/she replied that &amp;#34;it Is raw unrefined shea, the natural earthly smell ( moldy , cigarettes, ) that&#x27;s it the pure shea , we also sell the filterend and deodorized also listed in our store it also is poured from different batches, each batch has a light to a strong smell we sell good 10000lb month&amp;#34; I&#x27;m pretty sure it should never smell of CIGARETTES OR MOLD!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please do your research. You really do get what you pay for. A bargain is not always worth it in e end. Hint of advise...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ROSE MOINTAIN HERBS!! I&#x27;ve never before advocated or helped advertise for anyone but the differences are stark.</li>
    <li> MY TEENAGER LOVE THIS PRODUCT FOR THEIR HAIR</li>
    <li> This is just like the Shea Butter yu can buy on 125th St in NYC. Lots of product for your buck. Great for skin and super dry, textured hair.</li>
    <li> started using it for the first time and my hair and skin looks and feels wonderful. i highly recomemnd it to anyone that hasn&#x27;t tried it</li>
    <li> I love the stuff for my skin and hair. I always melt it, put any other oils in it, like coconut oil and olive and whip it up to make a cream like substance. For $11, this is  a steal for that much shea butter which will last me quit awhile. Buy ladies and gents. Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> This shea butter is a little grainy in texture; however, it works great for my hair and body creams that I make. I like the fact that the company listens/reads reviews. The packaging has improved significantly and I am no longer concerned about the container breaking prior to it being delivered</li>
    <li> Y&#x27;all I was scared at first to buy this because of some negative reviews but I&#x27;m sooooo glad I took the change not only did it smell nice its creamy and soft and amazing and the price is just right I will be a frequent buyer and will tell others about this product!</li>
    <li> Great for my skin and hair too . I mixed my Shear butter with avocado oil making  it smoother and my friends mixed with olive oil and jojoba  so far I love it and they love it too.</li>
    <li> Bought this after reading a magazine article.  Thought it would be very expensive but found it to be very reasonable.  Read the reviews and most loved it but a few complaints about odor.  I found it to have a nutty smell and not anything unpleasant.  Its affects on skin and hair is fabulous! This stuff works wonders.  No greasy feel but after one use you can feel skin is amazingly softer.  This product is awesome!!!!</li>
    <li> This product was hard as rock, I also noticed it changed the complexion of my skin, I looked much darker.</li>
    <li> Has done wonders for my skin. It&#x27;s much less dry! What else is there to say - just get it!</li>
    <li> I brought this to see if it works on dark spot don&#x27;t know yet</li>
    <li> Fantastic for use as a hand cream or as an ingredient in soap or body butter.  I wish I had understood ahead of time the depth of aroma from the unrefined shea butter.  Its not unpleasant, but it does have its own smell.  If you intend to make something scented, get the refined version.  If you are looking for something more natural, this is excellent.</li>
    <li> My cousin swore by this shea butter but refused to tell me where i could purchase it. So glad i tried Amazon! I have been using it for three days and already my skin is smoother and softer. I definately will be a repeat customer!</li>
    <li> I bought this for cosmetic making purposes but have been using it for my skin. It is doing amazing things for my dry cracked feet!</li>
    <li> This shea butter is not as good as others I&#x27;ve purchased here. I have had to apply it more frequently and there is quite a bit of grit in it. Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love the using product for body but, too strong for my family&#x27;s face (also gives a greasy affect). P.s. great for the rough bodily parts, knees, elbows and even better for feet. Bought bigger tub than usual to share w/best friend. It also lasts for months at a time even w/the smaller tub.</li>
    <li> These containers visually look small online ad.  However  I should have paid closer attention to size of containers.  They are huge:)&lt;br /&gt;I got a lot more than expected but that&#x27;s OK because I love the stuff and will definitely use.  It will probably last for a couple of years but I don&#x27;t think it goes bad so I&#x27;m fine with my Oops!</li>
    <li> It leave my family hair shiny and skin smooth Love it!</li>
    <li> this product is great I love it arrived well packaged and the sheabutter was nice and soft, i didn&#x27;t hato rub all day to get it to melt into to my skin. this is really a ggod product</li>
    <li> I received my order..  But not in the container..  Not as the picture showed</li>
    <li> I use the shea butter all the time and this is a huge tub. I usually melt down the butter, mix in a few essential oils and let it return to about 90% of it&#x27;s original solid form. Then I whip it up into a smoother texture and transfer it to smaller jars. For thicker hair, it&#x27;s a great moisturizer. And after bath and in the warmer months, the smoother texture is great for after bath/shower and all day moisture.</li>
    <li> Shea butter is amazing. The shea butter is completely solid, however as I scraped it from the container, it softens on the palm of my hands. It leaves my skin moist and soft. Overall, this product was worth buying.</li>
    <li> I LOVE USING SHEA BUTTER,THE PRICE WAS REASONABLE FOR DIS OZ N ITS DA REAL DEAL I USE IT EVERYDAY.</li>
    <li> I am a repeat customer. I make soap, lotion, deodorant, you name it I make it. I refuse to use the crap big corporations make. I love shea butter because of it&#x27;s smoothness and sustainability. It lasts and lasts.</li>
    <li> My family and I really enjoy using shea butter. We use it on our hair and body and the results are amazing. Fast shipping, happy and satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered, on time delivery and no problems. Thank you.</li>
    <li> When using this product, it worked okay, but the research that I have done on organic shea butter tells me that this product may not be actual African Shea Butter. This product may be just plain African Butter(kpangnan) that comes from a totally different tree, that grows in a totally different part of Africa, then where  African Shea butter would come from. Like I said in a earlier comment, it worked okay, but if I order African Shea Butter, that is what I expect to get. Future customers, please do your homework on this product, for if you are purchasing African Shea Butter, that is what you should received.</li>
    <li> This product did not meet my expectations.  The shea butter was forwarded in a clear plastic bag in big chunks and not a container.  There was no information about it&#x27;s contents or anything.  I have no idea how much I received in this shipment.  I will not buy from this company again.</li>
    <li> Great product! Great deal. It is awesome and long lasting. I add coconut oil to make it glide better and also for a better scent. This is a great product that should be used to replace every lotion and hair oil. I love this product.</li>
    <li> I have no problem with the product. However, the packaging is misleading. According to picture, one would think product came packaged as shown. To my disappointment, instead of containers shown product arrived in sealed plastic bag. Therefore, I gave it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> I usually buy another brand of shea which is much more expensive than this so I was hesitant. We couldn&#x27;t live without this stuff and use it all the time. The order I received from this seller exceeded my expectations. It was a nice smooth shea butter, not chunky or hard like some reviewers received. Melts quickly in your palm and doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming smell. It smells like shea butter. Will be a return customer.</li>
    <li> Was wonderful and good and service are also excellent and fast</li>
    <li> I use this everyday in my skin, face, hair, everywhere! It&#x27;s so moisturizing and gives my skin a Healthy glow. I recommend it</li>
    <li> I loved the shea butter I have been using on my hair, it does wonders mixed with a few other oils. So I needed another one, and I bought this! I got it, it works fine, smells the same as my other one, everything is the same except when it came in the mail it had these white spots in the shea butter its self (I do not know if it is because it is 10 degrees outside.) Also, the container was cracked. It was not the seller&#x27;s fault, my mailman probably dropped it, so I will not take a star away. Love shea butter but never could find it in any stores with the 32 oz. Overall, This is a good buy!</li>
    <li> this is such a life saver. keeps my skin moisturized all day and slowly evens out my skin tone and clears out stretch marks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve usually pick up the 16oz from my local beauty supply store but my boyfriend and I just moved from the east coast to the west coast and where we live now there aren&#x27;t any beauty supply stores quite like the one back east in close proximity... so I opted to order online and decided to go with a larger batch as my boyfriend uses it as well. We both use it for our skin and hair. I also got the larger batch so that I can make separate skin and hair creams...though the batch I received is very odd it my opinion. The smell isn&#x27;t too off putting but its as if it has a yellow dye in it as you melt it with your hand. If you&#x27;re wearing maybe a white camisole or something it was leave yellow stains...I&#x27;m not sure if the purest has more of a yellow tint that refined shea butter but I don&#x27;t think it sure leave a yellow residue... the batch I had been purchasing originally had been by a different company. Though they have nearly identical labels my other brand had it&#x27;s logo listed on it, RA Cosmetics. Also the other stated on it that is was unrefined shea butter and this one did not...so is it? Also it came in chunks instead of smooth like it&#x27;s described and shown in the pictures. I feel like I got less than the 32oz as there&#x27;s so much space between the large chunks. The consistency of the chunks are also a little weird some parts are super soft and others harder and crumbly. I&#x27;m going to try and make the creams and use it all up but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be ordering this again.</li>
    <li> I ordered this type of yellow african shea after reading reviews of how great it was.  I saw YouTube videos of others that had ordered this and mine came nothing like theirs. I ordered the 32oz as pictured and it came clumped together in rock looking balls that dont feel up the whole container. Because they are in rock/ball shape there are spaces all throughout the container. There is not 32oz worth in the container. I usually order coastal scents shea butter which is NOTHING like what I received. I thought I would try this yellow African shea butter, and ill make the most out of it,  but I will not be ordering this again.</li>
    <li> Its a great source of healing rashes, minior curs and protecting skin</li>
    <li> I use this on my skin, as well as mixing with different oils for use in my 4B curly hair.  My hair loves it!  I like the fact that I could order the two pack and always have it on hand.</li>
    <li> I use this Shea butter for soap making and incorporate it into my soap free facial wash. It has a nice earthy smell and is smooth and creamy.  It&#x27;s a wonderful moisturizer loaded with vitamin A, which helps heal and protect the skin. It also has natural vitamin E. I use this as sunscreen instead of the toxic creams on the market today. I read reviews about larger volumes of Shea butter not smelling all that good. I buy these small tubs and am very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> my hair loves shea butter. as soon as i put it on my scalp, my hair grows so fast. the downside of using shea butter is that my scalp eats it up within a day. i was running low on shea butter and needed more so i found this seller. its hard to find 32oz of shea butter for under $20. i will be ordering from them again.</li>
    <li> This shea butter made my head itch, eyes swell up and nose clog. I&#x27;m not even kidding. I don&#x27;t know what it is but many of these shea butters are not responding well with me all of a sudden. I have been using them for years and now this. I can&#x27;t help but wonder if there is something being added to the shea butters to make them have this affect or if it is legitimately an allergic reaction.</li>
    <li> The container lid was all cracked up.  I don&#x27;t know if they packaged it that way, or it was mishandled during shipping.  The shea worked for my soaps.</li>
    <li> Bought this to make homemade lotion for my granddaughter who has eczema and allergic to 95% of what is on the the market.  Works well</li>
    <li> Shea Butter is the best thing for my skin. Shea Butter is great for dry skin during the harsh winters and it provides a smoothness and shine that makes the skin feel great.</li>
    <li> This shea butter is huge, like a big jar of mayo !  I have had a dry patch on the back of my hand for over 10 years, and after using this twice, it is fading ! It is hard, so I just scrape some off to use it !  It makes your skin so soft. And it will last a very long time.</li>
    <li> I thought this to have been a better product, but it was not smooth as the products in past, sad.</li>
    <li> I know the general opinion is there is not a lot of difference between the off white and yellow. But, and to be honest I&#x27;ve only tired this yellow one against 2 of the off white, the smell alone was something I couldn&#x27;t stand in this yellow one. To me it smelled like rancid shortening. And if you have ever smelled that, you NEVER forget. It is truly only the raw off white for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been ordering this product for over 2 years and I haven&#x27;t used regular body lotion. It leaves my skin so smooth.</li>
    <li> It is a good product and I am happy wit it and I will purchase it again when we need it.</li>
    <li> The seal was cracked upon arrival and the product was hard and dry...very difficult to use. I ended up heating the whole container to get it out...and I only needed 1/2...what a waste.</li>
    <li> The Shea butter was everything I expected... Smooth texture and soothing to my body.  When we received the product, the top on one of the containers was off and both containers were cracked around the top edges. Otherwise, we are very pleased. Thanks.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using african shea butter so I dont have any comparisons but this works great for what I needed it for. If and when I run out, I will buy from here again!</li>
    <li> Most natural products are too musky or too odorous for me but this one works fine. I use this everyday and I even have friends starting to use it.</li>
    <li> I tried this on my face to moisturize and help even out my complexion, it broke me out horribly, so I didn&#x27;t to use it in my hair to moisturize, but when i combed my hair it was so difficult it was as if I had put super glue in my hair , i had to wash it out, just to be able to style my hair. So then I used it on my body for stretch marks, just a little, but the product is so heavy, it felt like the pores on my body was being clogged. So i gave up on it and gave it to my mom, who also ended up breaking out from it and usually nothing breaks her out, because she has perfect skin. This was definitely a waste of money. Oh and the one I ordered was solid, not creamy, but it didn&#x27;t melt very well. Will never purchase again!</li>
    <li> This is the only moisturizer I use for my body.  Love the way my skin feels.  Would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I make lots of products with this from creams to lip balms. It is a great Shea Butter for the price.</li>
    <li> This African Shea Butter has been a great addition to our family.  No more dry skin, achy knees, feet, or joints.</li>
    <li> Connect the product was on time and deal with the seller very sophisticated product is worth the experience&lt;br /&gt;Worth 5 stars</li>
    <li> The shea butter is great, but that packaging was terrible. Anyone who has used Shea butters, knows that it has a low melting point.  It was summer time when I received it and so the Shea butter melted all over the package and was still liquid by the time I received it. Needless to say it was a big mess and I wasn&#x27;t very happy!</li>
    <li> I would have given it a 5 star but the product was in a plastic bag, not the container as shown</li>
    <li> I make homemade lip balm, and this much shea butter at this low of a price and of such good quality saves the day!</li>
    <li> works amazing! not exactly what I expected (was expecting it to be more moist in the container) but that&#x27;s not a big deal at all! all I wanted was it to work and it does! :) I love it and will definitely be buying this product again in the future.</li>
    <li> Pro:s&lt;br /&gt;1. A Little Goes a long way&lt;br /&gt;2. What I expect from 100% shea butter&lt;br /&gt;3. My package was not the same from the picture. It was a shorter wider tub, but I actually preffer it to the one in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;4. The shea was all broken into smaller pieces, with makes it easier to use straight from the jar....but it makes me wonder if I got a full 32 oz. I did not measure but it looks like 2 pounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;None, I would order it again....and again... and agian. lol</li>
    <li> I love shea butter because it moisturizes the skin so well.  Since moving to Nevada, I need to moisturize daily and this is by far the best for my skin.</li>
    <li> This was the most disgusting smelling Shea Butter I have ever smelled. It was almost like a rotten peanut butter smell, and extremely grainy and chalky. I would not recommend, and I should have returned instead of trying to add my expensive essential oils to make it smell better.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and I mix a little of this with my moisturizer and my skin feels soft all day</li>
    <li> More goodies to try to make my own stuff because of all my allergies to chemicals. Have to wait for the results</li>
    <li> I received my shea butter in random chunks in a big plastic bag ....not the plastic containers as shown.  there was no label, no instructions for storing or usage although i already had plans for using it.  i would have have preferred a container. I am assuming it is shea butter cause it&#x27;s what i ordered.  i&#x27;ve never used it before.  it was soft and easy to work with.  i like what i got so far.  i will probably buy from these guys again because of the great price.</li>
    <li> This shea butter comes just right to melt down and use in lotions, deoderants, etc.... The container it comes in is just right for storage.</li>
    <li> Product worked well. I combined it with coconut and jojoba oils for my skin and hair and I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using pure African Shea butter for almost fifteen years now (for both my skin and hair), and this is as good as any other brand I&#x27;ve used. In the past when ordering from this vendor I received the product in a plastic container (as pictured), but this time it was in a big plastic bag in big chucks. I was fine with that though because such packaging isn&#x27;t indicative of quality. However, after melting it down, I was even more pleased. I ended up with closer to 2 1/2 pounds, even though I only paid for 2 pounds! I&#x27;ll continue to use this vendor for future purchases.</li>
    <li> I use for stretch marks and it has worked out pretty well for me. Now I can make creams to keep my skin very soft. The product goes a long way so it&#x27;s worth the price! I just love it and I&#x27;ll surely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have received this shea butter a few weeks ago, and used it to successfully clear an eczema-like rash (undiagnosed) from my son&#x27;s hands.  Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I had purchased the white shea butter and loved it. The yellow has a stronger mineral smell.</li>
    <li> The price was unbelievable and with Amazon Prime, there was no shipping cost. I felt like I won the lottery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it works and I am smooth and soft. I scoop out a few ounces, put it in a glass jar, add olive oil and fragrance, then melt it down and let it set. I usually put some on in the morning. It lasts all day and I don&#x27;t feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I have been ordering shea butter from other places for over 10 years and never had a batch so yellow before, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me now.</li>
    <li> Very good product. My kids use it and it keeps their skin moisturized and smells good too. We did get a container that was cracked one time but product was still useable</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. 32oz will make enough body butter for a year. Mix with coconut oil, jojoba oil and essential oil of your choice. Beware, it doesn&#x27;t soften up unless you whip it in a large Kitchen Aid type mixer.</li>
    <li> This product is very gritty, but it&#x27;s still work at moisturizing my skin and hair. It does take a while to rub in if your hands/hair are wet. I&#x27;m not sure if its 100% all natural.But for the price, you get a fair amount.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shea butter for years to make my soap, lotion bars and sunscreen. The product itself great. Before I used this one, I was using a shea butter from a local Big Box Store and it was a little grainy and the color wasn&#x27;t uniform.  This was a little more expensive, but I feel the product is so much better. It melts easily with the other fats, but stays solid even in the summer. One negative comment...every time I have ordered which has been 4 times so far, the plastic container was broken. One time the container had a huge crack in side with a piece of the container missing. This time the lid was cracked and can&#x27;t be properly sealed. Because the product stays solid and it&#x27;s not being used as food, it&#x27;s not that big of a deal.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what the diff is between this and the less yellow kind. I&#x27;ve heard about 3 or 4 different explanation for the difference from  species of tree to variation in the refinement process. I&#x27;ve tried both and cannot tell a diff between them once applied besides the yellow one having a stronger smell when you first put it on. It isn&#x27;t a lasting smell, nor is it bad. This stuff can be pretty hard so you need to either warm a little up before using in microwave or whatever, have hot hands, or you can prepare a lot of it at a time by melting and then whipping it as it cools to make it much softer. I melt it and mix it with some Vitamin E oil and sometimes some other stuff and then whip it every so often as it cools. This makes it much easier to use getting out of the shower.</li>
    <li> Bigger than it looks, more Shea butter than it looks, and is so darn affordable. Love it! Going to purchase more in a few days. Shea butter needs no critique because if you have used it, you already know its great natural powers of healing. And if you haven&#x27;t ever tried Shea butter then I suggest you try it soon. This one is the real thing for a price that is affordable.</li>
    <li> I used this in my mixture of body butter and I love, love, love the results. I highly recommend !!!</li>
    <li> Be warned: THIS DOESN&amp;#34;T COME IN A CONTAINER AS PICTURED. I was mailed bricks of shea in plastic bags. The shea is good quality, but the photo is misleading as it does not come in a hard plastic container with a top</li>
    <li> I have ordered before with no problem but this batch had a high fishy smell. It was very unpleasant. It works great if you can put up with the smell, but it was unbearable for me. Hopefully it was just one bitch that was bad.</li>
    <li> this is a great product. its a bit hard when you get it but if the container sits in a warm room, it soften up the shea butter.  i would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> these are the best shea butters around. silky, melty, tasty (our 2 year old thinks so), and very nourishing.  Just whip 2C of shea with 2T of lanolin, 2T jojoba and 2tsp of veg. glycerin.  I don&#x27;t like using coconut oil as it makes the mix more stainuous, but it does add protection and shine. If you melt everything, you can also add beeswax.  Then let it set up again and whip.  after a bath or after shaving just get a daub and it goes on like... well like shea butter.</li>
    <li> makes your skin feel great i do see the change in my skin and my family kids love to use it all the time</li>
    <li> I rescind getting this especially for natural because it&#x27;s pretty big and it is very good quality for your money.</li>
    <li> I recieved my shea butter today, and the first thing I noticed was it was cracked. Then I noticed the label wasnt right. So I checked, it doesnt have the original label younsee in the picture or on any of the real containers. I do believe this is either a knock off or a defected one. But It seems like real shea butter. I hope its atleast somewhat of the same quality and will work on my hair the way I plan. But im disappointed I didnt get what I thought I was purchasing. Youd think amazon would keep a closer eye on the prime products, since people are paying for that service. Overall, its orobably a cheaper version of shea. I just wish I didnt buy so much.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome!  I am 48 years old with very dry skin, a pedicure never softened my skin, but this shea butter has softened my skin in less than a week.  I use the product on my entire body, but my feet get special attention.  I use it at night, and on days I am staying home, I apply a thick coat on my feet and put my socks on.  When I take my socks off all I can do is smile and say wow.  I love this product, it smells like cocoa butter, looks like thick mustard, but it works wonders.  Take it from a grandmother of 4 this stuff is the bomb.com!!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutly love this stuff for making skin soft and smooth, I purchased this one for my grandsons delicate skin.</li>
    <li> A lot cheaper than purchasing at store.  Seems to be of a decent quality as it has helped my skin issues.  I melt it in a double cup hot water bath so it is easier to spread.</li>
    <li> pure, great, authentic quality.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really like this as well as I had hoped.  It was a little more strong-smelling than I anticipated, and I didn&#x27;t care for the yellow color.  It worked as expected when I made some lotion bars, but the strong scent still came through in the finished product.  I will likely not order this again.</li>
    <li> Product was what I expected but it was sent wrapped in plastic instead of in a tub. Wasnt expecting that. Half was soft and easy to mix with my other oils. Other half was hard.. dont know why but overall I was satisfies. Love shea butter</li>
    <li> My order arrived quickly and in perfect condition. My container was not compromised, as I&#x27;ve seen complained of, and the shea butter was certainly fresh. It was creamier than stuff I&#x27;ve bought from local retailers, in fact!</li>
    <li> Is amazing for the skin for any reason!  I continue to reorder this item and use for moisturizing and my husband&#x27;s winter rash!</li>
    <li> Good bargain.  last long.</li>
    <li> This stuff is seriously the do all magic product. Initially, I bought it to try on my hair. I&#x27;m caucasian with very curly hair and always look for ways to help tame it.  Just a little combined with another hair cream helps with the frizz . I decided to try it on my skin and I noticed a HUGE difference after day 1! It immediately cleared up problem areas, and leaves my skin looking and feeling amazing. I apply it at night since it does go on a little greasy, but it&#x27;s now the only thing I use for my face and body.  LOVE. IT!!</li>
    <li> This arrived on time and in good condition.  It has a smell to it that other shea butters I have boughten for personal use do not have.  I use it for making lotion bars though and add essential and fragrance oils to them so the smell isn&#x27;t noticeable when it&#x27;s combined with other things.</li>
    <li> This product is good.  I&#x27;m using it with bio oil to and it has reduced the appearance of my stretch mark.</li>
    <li> Purchased for a friend. She mixes it with essential oils and uses on her scalp and hair. She swears that it makes her hair soft and shiny. Looks great to me.</li>
    <li> The shea butter is alright, but it&#x27;s not really shea butter. It&#x27;s yellow and will make light colored clothing yellow. It smells slightly nutty and bad to me so I only use it when I won&#x27;t be around people and it has time to dry and absorb so it can moisturize my skin before I put on nice smelling products. It comes hard and mine didn&#x27;t liquify well. It is slightly grainy but not enough to bother me. I particularity like using it on my face because the weather has been so cold that my skin is extremely dry. My skin can get very oily from most types of lotions but the shea butter hasn&#x27;t caused any increased breaking out like others have. I don&#x27;t like using it at all in the morning because of the smell and the shine and oily feeling it leaves until it absorbs and because it takes so long to absorb. I do like how well it moisturizes but I&#x27;ll be trying other products in search of something better.</li>
    <li> Works almost instantly. After three days of using this product, my skin feels softer than babies skin. I definitely recommend this product, and i always offer it to my friends to try. My friends love it too by the way. The only downside, the container was cracked when i got it, even though it was in packing peanuts. But that wasn&#x27;t even a big deal, tape fixed it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve known about raw shea butter for years. Now, I am wondering why I hadn&#x27;t purchased it years ago. I did have store bought shea butter that took away my booty stretch marks, but never have I had raw shea butter. I have been using it for two days. As farfetched as it sounds, my skin is glowing. I want to throw all my lotions away, and make love to this product. I perused the comments before I purchased this product. The smell is not that bad. It initially smells like kid&#x27;s playdoe(however you spell it), but the smells doesn&#x27;t last. Furthermore, the product is not oily, it immediately absorbs in your skin. I use it all over, even on my face! I have combination skin on my face so I avoid many facial creams, but this stuff right here *Kat Williams voice* is blessed. It can be used from head to toe! Oh how much money I could&#x27;ve saved if I would&#x27;ve known I was going to be pleased!</li>
    <li> Container was cracked at the bottom but there was no product leakage; didn&#x27;t bother me enough to send it back. Great product at a great price. Would order again</li>
    <li> I love my shea butter.  Great price. I am so happy because this is all I use on my skin. Thank you</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. 32oz will make enough body butter for a year. Mix with coconut oil, jojoba oil and essential oil of your choice. Beware, it doesn&#x27;t soften up unless you whip it in a large Kitchen Aid type mixer.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THE SIZE, THE USES, THE FEELING, EVERYTHING! This is amazing stuff! I used it on my sisters sunburn (she has reeealy white skin btw haha) and the pain and burn is already reduced! The texture is just great and it came on time. I use some for my hair, lips, and this burn that I got from a waxing :/ lol. This stuff is awesome. I would buy again :D(which wont be until who knows when because it is such a huge container (bonus!) :)</li>
    <li> The product looks good. But the plastic tub container, upon receiving, had a big crack at the bottom, which extended 1/3 up the side. I hope it&#x27;s not contaminated. I contacted the seller. What a shame.</li>
    <li> Received a rancid batch</li>
    <li> Great price! Fast shipping! Mine is in great condition. This will last a very long time.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I wanted. I would have given this 5 stars except that is took 3 weeks to ship which was very unexpected. This container is packed, which is nice because some local options I&#x27;ve seen haven&#x27;t done that. I certainly recommend this product for anyone who make their own health and beauty products or just wants to use it by itself. I personally use it to make body butter but shea butter is extremely versatile!</li>
    <li> Was very pleased with the quality AND quantity of this product.  Very pure, no odor, Used it to make hand cream and it was wonderful.  Will definitely buy again.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Huge tub of the good stuff! Hair protectant and skin revitalizer. Amazing! And so affordable. Recommend softening a bit in your hands first.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shea to make lotion bars. It works and makes my skin very soft, but the smell is very overpowering and the color made my lotion bars darker than I prefer them to be. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again to make lotion bars. I&#x27;m sure it has other uses that it would be fine for.</li>
    <li> I just love shea butter, it works wonders for my skin. Makes it so smooth and fresh looking. It&#x27;s oily so I use it mostly at night and use a little during day.</li>
    <li> I love the product but this is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered this product and when I received the butter, the container can cracked.</li>
    <li> Shea butter is so much better than cocoa butter, love this.....</li>
    <li> Not like the picture, I wanted a yellow butter but I found it white&lt;br /&gt;Also, very bad packing&lt;br /&gt;I am really disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is a bargain at this price. Great natural skin conditioner.</li>
    <li> Ok listen, this isn&#x27;t what many of us are used to.. But once you scoop a lil up with you finger and let the warmth of your hands rubbing together melt it and you smooth it on and rub it in you will be hooked! Your skin willingly will absorb this product and retain its effect! I love it! I will never go to another skin softener!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have enjoyed several products from this seller! I&#x27;m a buyer for life on this product and the dudu osun line..&lt;br /&gt;The seller was kind and swift in answering questions I had about the product!</li>
    <li> Perfect I love this product it was worth the funds and I wll tell my friends to purchase it also</li>
    <li> This stuff smells really bad.</li>
    <li> This shea butter has a vegetable or root dye added to make it so yellow.  When I rub it in my hands, my hands are yellow and with my olive coloring, I&#x27;m not to happen about looking yellow until this stuff is absorbed.  I&#x27;ve been using raw shea butter for years and this is the first time that I have seen this color yellow in shea butter however it seems to moisturize as well as other raw shea butters I&#x27;ve used.  I do not like the yellow dye at all.  I suspect that other things have been added to this brand of butter also.  It has an oiler feel to it that I have never encountered in all my years of using raw, unrefined shea butter.  Maybe something like olive oil or something has been added to this brand and this is why they can sell it for such a low price.  I won&#x27;t be reordering.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product! I am a massage therapist and use this on clients hands and feet and I mix it with jojoba oil to use on the rest of their body. It&#x27;s rich and nourishing to the skin and perfect glide to massage with.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF :) No more dry skin and it&#x27;s healing my dry cracked feet :)))!!!!! Highly recommended</li>
    <li> I like this shea butter. I use it to make my own thick creams and lotions with cocoa butter, coconut oil, avocado oil, and glycerine. It truly moisturizes my skin and seems to make it healthier. I&#x27;ve given up on store-bought lotions that generally seem too waxy and over scented. The shea scent is okay especially with a lot of cocoa butter added, so I usually leave the cream unscented, but sometimes I add a little lavender oil or other essential oil. I heat the ingredients in the microwave just enough to make them easy to stir, throw them together in a bowl, and mix them with my KitchenAid stand mixer until I get the thickness and fluffiness I want. By varying the portions I can make a very stiff cream that sets up and can be spooned into ice-cube sized molds (I use a heart shape) or a looser lotion that needs a container with lid. 32 ounces of shea butter is a large amount, so it makes a tremendous quantity of cream or lotion. I am happy with this purchase. The shea butter is a very rich yellow-gold color.</li>
    <li> Best thing in the world for moisturizing dry skin in the winter months. I learned that a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I still have She Butter that I purchased from them long ago. It&#x27;s perfect quality and I love using in the products for my business. Knowing it is imported from Ghana to New York to California makes me a happy lady :)</li>
    <li> I use it on my skin and hair. I love it! It is thick until u rub it well on ur hand before application so it can become an oil!</li>
    <li> Great product I use it for my body butter I make.</li>
    <li> Speedy Seller! This is a product I can&#x27;t be without!</li>
    <li> It has been very dry during this dry fall/summer/winter season. LOL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this African Shea butter has kept my skin in good shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus, this was a good buy and I will continue to buy it as long as they have it.</li>
    <li> Came very timely, however, the plastic container was cracked:(&lt;br /&gt;Grateful it was also wrapped in a bag or it could have been a huge mess and waste.</li>
    <li> Came exactly as advertised. Product is a little hard but it is what I needed and wanted!! Shipped in a timely fashion. Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> We found the 32-oz size price to most enticing. Don&#x27;t change it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We like that it is Unrefined and 100 % All Natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My personal sense of things is that relining the triglyceride (fat) which is the Butter takes some of the goodness and power from the shea tree. That power from the shea tree is what we were after. Plus, the refined stuff is considerably more expensive.</li>
    <li> I switched from cocoa butter to shea butter and am happy for it. Has a natural spf to it (so I&#x27;ve read). My only issue is that it smells...different. It&#x27;s not bad or good...just different. It&#x27;s definitely good for the skin!</li>
    <li> Amazing product!&lt;br /&gt;Smells and feels good. Exactly as expected</li>
    <li> Smells good and a great source of lubricant for dry skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using it as  lotion I wish it was a little softer so it would be easier to apply to my skin. I don&#x27;t think it SMELLGOOD,&lt;br /&gt;but it doesn&#x27;t smell bad either. It is not odorless though. Has almost a nutty scent I guess even if that doesn&#x27;t make sense it&#x27;s scent is similiar to the taste of cashews I guess you could say. this and cocoa butter are probably the closest thing you can get to a lotion without creating your own with products. Which is one of the things that I wanted out of it and it works out good just a little hard to apply opposed to a store bought lotion.  I&#x27;d recommend buying it if you looking into that for having your own lotion or making something with. it&#x27;s a good product &amp; I plan on using it as a deep conditioner, too.</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough about Shea Butter.  I may have to write a love song about Shea butter.  This stuff goes on greasy but soaks in and makes the skin so incredibly soft and supple.  It reduces fine lines and wrinkles, spottiness, stretch marks, and that kind of thing.  It goes a  really long way.  If you are not familiar with Shea Butter, it comes from an African gourd and comes out as a cream just as it is without refinement.  Amazing.</li>
    <li> This works well for my homemade whipped shea butter cream that I use on my hair and skin</li>
    <li> Loved the quality of the product and the sellers are the best ever.</li>
    <li> First of all, I love shea butter for moisturizing my skin, especially in the winter time. However, I have yet to receive a container from any supplier that weighs what it&#x27;s supposed to weigh. This seller is no exception. The container was several ounces short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, the shea butter from this source was dry and grainy compared to what I have used in the past. Even the plastic container was brittle and broke away as I scooped the stuff out. It&#x27;s as if the container were sitting in a display window exposed to UV from the sun for a long period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently, shea butter doesn&#x27;t move very fast, especially the large containers. The stuff I&#x27;ve purchased in the smaller containers (from other suppliers) seems to be fresher, so I recommend you try that. Good luck.</li>
    <li> Just as described! It came in a very large container and the quality is great. Shipment was very speedy as well.</li>
    <li> there really is not much you can say about shea butter.  it is great for your skin especially in the winter.  it keeps the skin moist and is good for helping even your skin tone.  I use it daily and it has helped remove acne scars, it has help with skin chaffing,  I have been using shea butter for years and will use nothing else.</li>
    <li> Although the container did have a few cracks, I was pleased to open a box with a container just as pictured. I am thoroughly satisfied with the quality of this product.</li>
    <li> Absolutely great for the skin....</li>
    <li> It is good , I used it 3times and my skin looks so soft&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband who suffers with eczema.  It arrived in just a couple of days and was perfect.  It was nice and creamy and he has seen an improvement in his eczema with daily use.</li>
    <li> Love my African Shea Butter. The only thing that was missing is how to mix to create lotions and cremes.</li>
    <li> Ordered this product and it arrived yesterday. The container itself was cracked open inside the box , and had leaked through the cardboard everywhere&lt;br /&gt;Onto my furniture and porch floor. VERY DISSAPOINTED!!!</li>
    <li> This Shea Butter is very fresh. It melts in your hands or once it makes contact with your skin. It immediately softens the skin packaging was great and it arrived before the deadline. Never knew Shea Butter did so many things so I rubbed it in my sore knee it stopped aching</li>
    <li> Is a great product it really works the way it saids it dose i love it i will definitely will purchase more in the future</li>
    <li> I used it to put on my little one and it worked fine. I have yet to use it on my hair but I am sure it will work fine that is why I gave it a four star.</li>
    <li> Product could have been packaged better. Containers of the product leaked but overall I guess &amp;#34; you get what you pay for&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I use this Shea butter on both my skin and hair and I absolutely love it.  Will definitely buy again</li>
    <li> Awesome product with fast service</li>
    <li> Got what I expected - smooth, normal color and hardness shea butter.  Product was well packaged in a plastic container inside a plastic bag which was a good thing since the container was so full the cover didn&#x27;t quite fit on the container correctly.  No complaints here!</li>
    <li> terrible quality. grainy and dark. Smells diluted. Not worth 2 dollars</li>
    <li> It is weird ok it does great job moisturizing but it is the material itself the middle color was light green while the rest is yellow like the pic and the light green consistency is weird as well</li>
    <li> I love this African Shea butter, I use it on my hair and skin. I have 4b natural hair and I can really tell a difference in my hair. I also put a little on my face after I wash it and I am noticing a difference with my skin also.</li>
    <li> I received it fast. It looks just like the picture. It&#x27;s not hard and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad.&lt;br /&gt;A little crack in the container but it&#x27;s worth it. Will order again</li>
    <li> I received mines today. Can&#x27;t wait to start using it. The container is actually larger than I expected !</li>
    <li> Came solid as rock...in one side it looks like rotten bread,,and a very very strong smell that i can even store it bedroom,,</li>
    <li> My Shea butter came in a cracked container straight across the bottom.. I was not happy about this to say the least!</li>
    <li> i love shea butter. I use it in my homemade body lotion. This product is just the right consistency, not grainy like some I have gotten. Its nice and smooth and has that nice natual aroma that shea butter should have.</li>
    <li> Very good product.  The plastic container was in very good condition and the shea butter was firm and pliable.  If your&#x27;s seems a little hard. melt it in a low heat Hot Cabi or in a sealed container in a tub of hot water to make it a liquid consistency.  Makes an excellent body wrap moisturizer.</li>
    <li> The plastic container that the butter is in is cracked.  The lid does not close.  The butter is as hard as a rock.</li>
    <li> First of all, it was not in a tub as I had expected going by the picture. It was in a clear bag in chunks. It&#x27;s so difficult to mash to apply to the skin and when I finally got it on, my skin was still ashy.</li>
    <li> I was a little nervous at first since this was my first time buying this product. I ended up loving up! The product arrived way faster than the given date. It seemed like I received way more than 32oz lol. I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering from this company again!</li>
    <li> The Shea Butter was a good product, the order was on time. really enjoyed. the Shea butter for my skin and hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an older white woman--55.  My skin is overall in pretty good shape but I&#x27;m vain.  I want it to be better.  So I started using the Dudu-Osun soap about 2 months ago and added the shea butter last week. Directly out of the container it&#x27;s pretty stiff (though still usable) so I put a few tablespoons into a glass container with a lid and let it melt sitting atop my hair curlers.  It tends to go farther in liquid form and I slather it all over but I like the solid stuff on elbows, knees, feet and hands.  It feels a little sticky at first but goes in pretty quickly and the results are great--my hands and feet are softer and smoother than they have been in years. I had a few times where my facial skin reacted to the butter with itchiness but adding a little goats milk lotion has stopped that.  Interestingly, after the shea butter has melted and then cooled again in the glass jar, it has a different consistency (more like solid coconut oil) and a lower melting point than before.  I need only to touch it when it begins to melt.</li>
    <li> Its texture is like dryed out play doh but play doh smells alot better, hard to apply!!!</li>
    <li> good quality, melts well</li>
    <li> It is very good for dry skin</li>
    <li> Product came in a plastic bad in blocks, not in container as shown. Also more gritty then smooth, plan to cooked down to get creamy, smooth constancy.</li>
    <li> Great product for those who have eczema or severely dry skin. Product arrived about a week after I ordered it.</li>
    <li> I have used this in liquid soap and in bar soap and it turns out beutifully every time.  I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Package was broken and the shea butter was everywhere. Was such a mess tht I threw away the entire package. A waste.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this She Butter. I use it to make my shower scrub and it leaves my skin soft without any oily residue.</li>
    <li> Container cracked after the third time. Product was hard and it has a foul odor. I haven&#x27;t had too much of a chance to use it yet so I cannot tell you how good it works. I will try it when I get some gloves to wear so it  doesn&#x27;t stink up  my bedroom. If it works good I will add  another star. Update. It did work pretty good. I did get used to the smell</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Happy I receive my package. Haven&#x27;t even open it as yet but it smell great. I am absolutely disappointed however because they came in plastic bags and not the container as showed in the picture. NO STARS FOR PACKAGE!!!</li>
    <li> I use this for everything. The product is good. Has a slight nutty smell which is expected</li>
    <li> A friend of mine gave me some shea butter that he got from somewhere else.  When I was done with that I purchase this larger container and was pleasantly surprised that the price was less then my friend&#x27;s smaller container.  I love it!  It&#x27;s a little chunky and piecey, but melts quickly on warm skin.  It&#x27;s one of the only things that helps my psoriasis.  I use it as a moisturizer all over my body.  Keep in mind that this is an all natural product so it can be grainy and/or vary in consistency.  I&#x27;ve been using shea butter purchased from other places for a while and I&#x27;ve never encountered it as rock hard as some other people are saying.  On every container that I&#x27;ve ever had I managed to put a slit on the edge of the lid and the consistency has always stayed the same.</li>
    <li> The feel of this on my skin is WONDERFUL - BUT...the odor is so HORRIBLE I can&#x27;t bear to have it near me.  I&#x27;ve tried adding every essential oil I have on hand and nothing will mask the smell of this stuff.</li>
    <li> very good. it does not come in a jar like you see in pic but a big clear baggie. soo yeahhh but what i like about it is you get  a lot</li>
    <li> Smells really nasty,  but it is a great moisturizer:)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this one as much as the chunky tub I bought before.  You have to scrape off the amount you want with a spoon or something similar.  I didn&#x27;t need an extra step to my nighttime routine.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really moisturiizing, but because it&#x27;s so thick if you put it on your legs you can&#x27;t get your jeans on and it&#x27;s very oily, I&#x27;ve been using thins on my face before I go to bed and my skin is glowing. I wash my face, dry it and put a VERY thin layer on my face, you don&#x27;t want it clogging up your pores. I do this before bed because you cnt apply makeup over it.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have ever used...from sunscreen to skin softener...my feet have never looked or felt better...my skin doesn&#x27;t dry out...never will I ever use another product!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!!!  Can be used for anything hair and body!!!  And it smells wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this for everyone!!</li>
    <li> I bought a large container and I mix it with lotions because it&#x27;s so thick and oily.  I do use it plain on my lips, but for the body you must use lotion also to avoid being super oily.  I only used it at night and it is very difficult to use and spread when trying to apply plain, you have to scoop it out of the container and rub it vigoriously between your hands to soften it.  I sometimes put it in the microwave to melt it and then add lotion to thicken it and dilute the oiliness.  Also, it has a pleasant odor that isn&#x27;t offensive at all</li>
    <li> This is great, makes skin look luminous ! I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now, a definite repurchase.</li>
    <li> Great product. Doesn&#x27;t come in packaging shown but works wonders.</li>
    <li> I hav been using this product for years, but was having difficulty finding it locally.  I am pleased to be able order at will. plus in the larger quantity for less money.</li>
    <li> Much better products out there. Do not buy!!!</li>
    <li> I like the raw not refined much better.</li>
    <li> Love Shea Butter good for this aging skin</li>
    <li> Its Shea butter at a great price. What else can I say</li>
    <li> I use it on my face all the time and I love love it 😄</li>
    <li> AMAZING. Best Shea butter ever! I have switched my Clinic, MAC and Chanel customers to non toxic products!!! awesome!</li>
    <li> I met a nutritionist on a beach in Kauai. I was using Vaseline to keep my lips moist. She explained the petroleum products coat the liver, kidney, spleen, etc.. (not good). She recommended this, and I will never go back to petroleum products. Will buy again, however it has been a year and I still have over 2/3 left.</li>
    <li> This item is great and all natural which is very important to me.  I am highly sensitive to chemicals and many products that we put on our bodies harm us.  I use this product instead of lotions which has chemicals in them.  I have no adverse reactions when I use It  and absorbs well and has no greasy residue left on my skin as long has it is rub into the skin well.</li>
    <li> It looks and feels awesome. And i think it cured my allergic reaction on my skin in three days. I have a good feeling about this.</li>
    <li> I like this stuff and this seller.  I strayed to another supplier and was not happy with the quality.  All the shea I received from this seller was fresh, packaged well and had a decent shelf life.  I will be back to purchase more for myself and my family. Regarding shea in general it is a great moisturizer and plays well with other oils.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, but too greasy. After watching reviews on YouTube, I&#x27;m not sure if this is actually a good product.  They say the ivory Shea butter is best.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I deal with you very bad picture shows it raw shea butter yellow and come in a plastic box and this is usual that I used it, I received Beige ugly and bad texture and also in the form of bags very sickening spite of my weight 32 oz&lt;br /&gt;Lost my money on merchandise too bad</li>
    <li> i love it and thinks a lot ....</li>
    <li> Although many people recommended this, I found that it burned my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps it is just an allergy but I cannot use and sadly had to toss it.</li>
    <li> Good product. Not in plastic container as pictured.  But who doesn&#x27;t have a plastic container to put it in.</li>
    <li> IT comes in the huge container pictured. Before first use, I left in the bathroom so the shower steam would soften it a bit. I think it will last me quite a while. Definitely the real deal at a great price. Thanks!</li>
    <li> use this to make lotions. Made the product very runny. And it stayed Yellow. other Shea Butter I have bought always turned white when I finished my product.</li>
    <li> I use shea butter all the time and decided to try this brand. Needless to say it will not be ordered again from this supplier. First the top of the container was busted so I had to plastic bag the container and use a large rubber band to keep it air tight. Second it does not want to elt when you rub it in your hands. The texture is rather like @Play Dough and it feels like you are rubbing a thick paste on your skin. So unhappy. Just proves you get what you pay for and this may be cheap but it&#x27;s a total waste of money.</li>
    <li> this product is so soft and smooth i was surprised, very pleased, will probaly order from this vendor again</li>
    <li> I love the Africa Shea butter ! Works so good with my skin! I have stopped buy lotions now, this stuff I can use on my hair, bites cuts strech mark , u mane it was make for it</li>
    <li> Received my tub of Shea and I could not to start using it.  It was really easy an soft to just slide two fingers across the top to scoop some out. A little bit goes a long ways. I put it on my face and my face stays moist for the whole day. This stuff is amazing!</li>
    <li> the tub was huge and i didnt know i could use shea butter so many ways, sunblock, lotion, hair care, etc.</li>
    <li> On time and high quality</li>
    <li> Works great for making lotions,lip balms,&amp; more! I bought this to make homeade lotions and beauty products and it works great and is a large amount for the price.</li>
    <li> Great product…use it everyday...</li>
    <li> I m very happy to have this product .. Absolutely excellent product ..I use everywhere face hands my hair ..</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE ONLY THING I PUT ON MY SKIN AND HAIR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!SOO0000000000GLAD SOMEONE TOLD ME ABOUT IT!!&lt;br /&gt;USE WITH BLACK SOAP ONLY!!!!</li>
    <li> This is the good Stuff really! Weather you are trying to fade a mark or just wanting a glow this is what you need. Also shea butter has many heathly ingredients  for your skin!</li>
    <li> Very good product. I was satisfied.</li>
    <li> Received package quickly  and unharmed</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Creamier than last brand I ordered, and the price was more reasonable than the last brand also.</li>
    <li> I love it!!  I bought the shea butter to use in a chapstick recipe, and my chapstick stayed silky smooth for over a year after I made it (unlike a friend&#x27;s, who made some using the same recipe).  Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Good Stuff. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because my container appeared soiled.</li>
    <li> The product is a little stiff when dipping your fingers into and trying to scoop it out it but it immediately softens when you rub it in. I made my own little concoction to soften it for daily use however. I melted it and added extra virgin olive oil while it was in its liquid form. Once it cooled, it was softer. I use it for my son who has eczema and dry scalp. It&#x27;s really good for moisture in the winter. I use it for my entire body including my hair. Literally from head to toe. I will certainly keep this in my rotation.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome.  We have replaced lotion and hair conditioner with shea butter.  My family&#x27;s skin is so soft and supple.  Shea butter warms in your hands and glides over your skin and does not leave a greasy residue or smell funny.  Our hair is au naturel and this stuff has kept it conditioned and moisturized the best in years.</li>
    <li> Happy with the amount of shea butter that I got for the price will last me a long time. Downside (minor) container was cracked in a few places when it arrived to me.</li>
    <li> works great. keeps my hands from cracking on these cold winter days we are having. have used this product for 2 years now.</li>
    <li> This Shea butter is great for your entire body. Rashes,dry skin and scalp  It last a long time and the price is GREAT</li>
    <li> I buy this for a friend, so I can&#x27;t really review it. I can tell you he Is very satisfied with it, and I can tell you that the seller was great. Would definitely use again and recommend.</li>
    <li> it arrived on time and was almost exactly what I wanted, just a little put off by the smell</li>
    <li> Love it! And it came fast too</li>
    <li> Product is dark yellow as pictured, but it did not come as pictured in the plastic container, but in a bulk plastic bag.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t live without it</li>
    <li> This shea butter is a excellent deal and it is a good for dry skin and whatever else you so choice.</li>
    <li> This product is soft and goes on smooth.  It moistens very well.  The only downside is that it will leave a yellow residue on your clothing and is hard to get out.  So be careful what you are wearing when you put this product on.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome!  I will continue to buy it</li>
    <li> No more dry skin. I use it everyday all over my body. I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else. It smells natural.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this! It came great and I will buy again. It moisturizes my skin and it&#x27;s perfect. My husband uses it as well.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because it came so fast &amp; it wasn&#x27;t as hard as the Shea butter that u find in stores. It was perfect &amp; I will definitely be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> Use soon after showering/bathing to trap moisture in skin. very protective.&lt;br /&gt;Careful: if you have a latex allergy, this may trigger some irritation on your skin.</li>
    <li> Packaging is very bad games are all broken and Shea amputation is very excellent and Alsaia the packaging and I lost a very explosive corrupted Earton</li>
    <li> wonderful moisturizing product. I plan on using it for my stretch marks while pregnant. Thanks so much! thanks a lot</li>
    <li> I use this on my skin and natural hair for supreme moisturization.  Yes, this product is hard, but once out, is easy to rub in hands and smooth in.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love it I use it on my natural hair I melted down and put it in my body wash lotion anything</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and this is the real deal.  It came in a plastic bag and I just put it in my own container.  Two lbs is a lot of product for the price.  Since I use it primarily on my face and hands it will last me at least a year.</li>
    <li> This product is hard to apply because it&#x27;s solid.  Google &amp;#34;shea body butter&amp;#34;  this makes it a lot easier to apply.  Body butter is basically melting it with a double boiler, add a little bit of carrier oil (I use sweet almond) let it cool but not become solid again (I put mine in the fridge to speed up the process) then whip it the way you&#x27;d make whipped cream.  Google body butter for a more detailed recipe.  This is a good product it makes my feet soooo soft.  Just apply and put on some socks overnight.</li>
    <li> The product is probably good for your skin and hair, but it is PEBBLY meaning it does not immediately dissolve into your skin.  Even when I mix it with coconut oil.  But I am working with it and hopefully it will do what I need it to do.  Buy the whipped Shea if you can!!</li>
    <li> i love love love this stuff! i am addicted to moisturizing (not kidding) and slather this stuff all over my body head to toe. i live in an arctic region and this kept my skin supple during -30 temps with crazy wind chills.</li>
    <li> this is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered this this is a very good product and the price cannot be beat if you want a good quality shea butter this is the one for you I recommend to everyone to try it if you only use as a skin moisturizer although it has hundreds of uses</li>
    <li> I love Shea butter wasn&#x27;t for sure it would meet my expectations but it did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend ordering from this person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mrs. Robinson</li>
    <li> Great quality....used in lotion and will continue to purchase this each time my stock runs low! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting such a large jar but the Shea Butter is good. The smell is a little too strong for me, but I still like the product.</li>
    <li> The container arrived cracked.</li>
    <li> Exactly what is described</li>
    <li> Very good product. Fast shipping I got this way before it was expected to be here. Its solid and smooth and easy to work with.  No strong odor in mine. The only reason it no getting all 5 stars is because it was a little under 2lbs.</li>
    <li> Just as described. Been using shea butter for a couple of years now. A little goes a long way so this was a great buy for the price. Will be buying from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I was looking for African Shea Butter that was like what I&#x27;ve purchased from vendors in NY.  Other than the smell being a little nuttier than usual, the texture was exactly what I was looking for...African Shea Butter is the best moisturizer I have ever used and the only one I will use.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for the creamy, ready to use then this is not for you.  It is raw. I am in awe at the many uses for this product. I mixed it with virgin coconut oil. It softens with a few good stirs, using a little at a time.  I have a lot of pain in my feet and was told that it is good for arthritus. I put some in a tealite warmer and added peppermint oil. It only takes a minute for the mixture to turn to oil. I put it on my feet and legs and the next morning I didn&#x27;t have pain walking like I normally do. It is great for burns and rashes.  A little goes a long way.  It is a great addition to any one that likes to do spa therapy or massage therapy. I recomend adding your favorite essential oil. Shea doesn&#x27;t smell bad but it is better when enhanced with your prefered oil scent.  You get a lot. If I ever run out I will buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> my locks love it. thanks.</li>
    <li> Love this Shea butter!  Arrived on time and packing was secure. I would order this again. Good price for Tue.amount received.  I usually pay twice this amount for half.the product. Itb was a win-win for me.</li>
    <li> It was significantly harder than I thought it would be and did not smell pleasant. Honestly  I&#x27;m used to putting up with the smell of tea tree oil, so the fact that I say this doesn&#x27;t smell good says a lot. That and I developed a bit of ache when using it.</li>
    <li> I love this shea butter. Melts fast and makes your skin feel smooth and moisturize, continuously. It is also good for your hair, face and body.</li>
    <li> Absolutely nothing like quality shea butter. It&#x27;s like rubbing on sand. I wrote this seller and no resolution was solved. Bad product, bad business. I only gave 1 star because I had to enter something. It is definitely a negative 10 stars!</li>
    <li> Sent this product to a relative.  She said the container was cracked and the shea butter was solid as a rock.  I told her to use an ice pick to chop it up.  I feel terrible sending her this product. I have never had shea butter that needed an ice pick!  You take a gamble on the quality of the product when you use this seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: To be fair, I must add this comment to the above statement.  I went to the local health food store and purchased the \\&quot;African Shea Butter,\\&quot; brand which is the exact same brand on Amazon.  You can get the African shea, smooth and hard (like my relative received) or soft and chunky.  I prefer the soft and chunky.  I would like to know what process is used to make the shea butter so hard?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be aware there are two consistencies available: smooth and hard or chunky and soft.</li>
    <li> Purchased the African Shea Butter to mix with other oils for hair care and skin care uses. Mixes very well with Olive Oil, Tea Tree Oil and Jojoba Oil. Product arrived in good condition, very please with this item.</li>
    <li> After reading some of the reviews, I was nervous about this product.  But my concerns were unfounded.  The smell is pleasant, the Shea butter is creamy, not grainy, the container is intact.  The price is good.  I won&#x27;t hesitate to buy this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the butter, straight out of the container as face and body cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warm it in your hands to soften it before using.</li>
    <li> I could literally feel the difference in one use. I would totally recommend this product its just amazing. Buy it!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this to make my lotions for my son who has excema. This product overall had the best reviews. I have tried blending with other oils and still cannot ge rid of the bad smell. I will keep trying with essential oils.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love. Best shea to whip. I am natural and this does not have as many shea nuts in it as others.</li>
    <li> I tried to use this product but the smell is so bad and strong that it makes all my lotions smell horrible</li>
    <li> This gives so much product I haven&#x27;t even gotten through half of it, since a little goes a long way. I actually had to start giving some away because there was so much.</li>
    <li> Hi Recieved my She Butter and its just like the pic-soft, and smooth and melts right in my hand lol. This is all I use when getting out the shower every night especially on the heel of my foot and also all on my feet. The Minnesota winter is bad on the skin and this does the work- no ash no where to be found. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I will need anymore Shea butter for 3 years!!! Thanks Seller for my butter. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve already used this in some homemade recipes and really like it. Mine didn&#x27;t have a funky smell and it looks just like it was pictured. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because the tub was cracked upon arrival. The shea butter is still usable though.</li>
    <li> So I received mine today. I wasn&#x27;t sure what it would feel like, it was cold since its winter when I received it and was more like the consistency of butter. I melted it for 2mins in my microwave, and it was more like a lotion. Love the feel of it. Oh, the smell - it didn&#x27;t smell bad at all. This product is great for skin especially in the winter months.</li>
    <li> Bought this to make homemade beard conditioner and works perfectly for that. Other than that, it&#x27;s as advertised, but it!</li>
    <li> 5 because the product and company are really good...great for skin, face, hands, feet, whole body; don&#x27;t know if i would use it on my hair...but great for skin.</li>
    <li> One of the best deals I&#x27;ve ever gotten! It&#x27;s nice and creamy, my family uses it for our hair and body.</li>
    <li> I make my own hand cream.  This is a very good butter and it smells fresh.</li>
    <li> I was a little worried, in spite of the mostly good reviews, because there was just one single small photo, the seller&#x27;s name seemed generic and unknown, and the price was the best I had been able to find.  It was a winner.  Every chunk was of the same consistency, beautiful and rich, with no foreign specs or impurities.  This is a full 2lbs!  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I used the Shea Butter to make creams, and the quality was fantastic! Friends loved the texture, and scent. Will buy again! :)</li>
    <li> This Shea came in a 32 oz container inside a well packed and supported box. The Shea is fresh, clean, and smells great. It is in solid form but its fine because I will be melting it down anyway.  I rubbed some off with my finger and applied to my skin to check the quality and found it,  to soften easily and absorbed into my skin with very little effort. This item shipped and delivered on time as well.  I will be buying from this seller again and not just for Shea.</li>
    <li> When I opened the box, I found the plastic tub of shea butter had been broken (it came in what looked like a take-out Chinese soup container).  The shea had begun drying out, and the consistency was no longer good.  Luckily, Amazon made it very easy to return!  Too bad, as it was a good price...</li>
    <li> All the complaints are ignorant shea butter is a butter if it&#x27;s hard warm it and make it sat it will soften. This is an awesome product THANKS</li>
    <li> Nice, simple non-allergenic moisture barrier. Warm it in you hand, and a little goes a long way! Pleasant natural fragrance.</li>
    <li> There is so much you can do I with this product ! I like to use to for shaving and it gives such a great and moisturizing  shave !</li>
    <li> I was very very skeptical about ordering this. Smaller sizes of Shea Butter cost $15-$20 plus shipping. This is an excellent deal, get it while you can! The Shea Butter comes in a tub and it was packaged very well in the box. I can&#x27;t wait to start using it on my hair and skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a tip for women who use Shea Butter mainly for their hair. Shea Butter by itself may make your hair dry and brittle. That&#x27;s because it&#x27;s best if you mix it with some oils. Tea tree oil and peppermint oil to heal your scalp. Olive Oil and Coconut Oil will make your hair really soft. There are many other recipes online. Try them out!</li>
    <li> I love that this shea butter is raw and natural and so very affordable.  The only reason I did not rate it a 5 star is that the natural smell is pretty strong.  Im wokring on ways to disguise it with essential oils so it is more pleasant for my massage clients.  It is wonderfully moisturizing for the skin and I love that it works at a cellular level as well to restore tired, dry skin.</li>
    <li> pretty good stuff. It&#x27;s a little thicker/more solid than some of the stuff I&#x27;ve bought from the local health food store. But I melted it, mixed in essential oils, and whipped it, so it turned out okay. But this price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> I read some of the reviews before and I think the ones who gave bad ones probably just don&#x27;t like Shea butter.  The product came as I expected, quicker than I expected.  It worked really well, I liked the consistency, as it was comparable to shea butter I&#x27;ve purchased from other companies.  It was a good quality, and I expected it to be hard.  Sometimes the softer butters have been more processed.  Overall, I&#x27;d give this product 5 stars because it is a good quality shea butter.</li>
    <li> I use this shea butter to make soap, body lotion, and treatment oils. It makes wonderful, skin nourishing products and I am very pleased. I am getting ready to purchase more and will continue to buy from this seller as long as I receive this kind of quality. Very pleased!</li>
    <li> This is very nice shea butter.  I use it for making homemade body butters and other skincare products.  It leaves skin feeling soft and nourished.</li>
    <li> Perfect like picking it in ny</li>
    <li> this shea butter smells like cigarette smoke.  i had to return it and it doesnt come packaged like the picture shows.  it comes it a sealed plastic bag.</li>
    <li> This butter is great, it is a little hard but warm it in a pot of hot water and it will liquefy.  It will be a little softer to get our of the container.  I use it on my hair, skin and sore joints.  It really works, I wear my hair natural and it applies just the right amount of oils to make my hair soft.  I also had some severe burns on my arm and it blended it in perfectly.  I will continue to buy..it really does work@@@</li>
    <li> Product was very wonderful I am I will recommend my friends and was quickly Aluswol Thank you very much Thanks</li>
    <li> This is a great product for my hair.  I use it almost everyday.  It leaves my hair soft and movable.  A must have for any hair regimen.</li>
    <li> i didnt like the packing&lt;br /&gt;it was all in one container&lt;br /&gt;all the boxes was in bad condition&lt;br /&gt;i m claming for wat i got&lt;br /&gt;i diidnt like what i got</li>
    <li> The butter came in a grocery  plastic bag. Very disappointing. I hope it works.</li>
    <li> miracle working for aches and pain, arrives in promised time</li>
    <li> I love Shea butter! I love it in my soaps. The biggest problem with this is how yellow it is.</li>
    <li> I just received my order and I can say I&#x27;m very pleased it didn&#x27;t take long got here sooner then they said. My container wasn&#x27;t cracked and I didn&#x27;t receive it in a plastic Walmart sack like some people said. It smell like natural Shea butter some people said that it stinks i guess they didn&#x27;t see &amp;#34;raw natural&amp;#34;. But it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if some people thought raw Shea butter was naturally fragrant like in the stores. I give it top ratings and will tell everyone about it. Thank you very much</li>
    <li> The container was split open and spilling into the secondary bag. It had a stein odor as well, but it was unrefined and natural and there was A LOT of it!</li>
    <li> The texture is smooth and product is soft.  I also like the sturdy container.  Will be ordering this on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> My magical butter I use everyday has made be take even better care myself.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t hesitate! buy now, its like a whole new body you&#x27;re putting on after just a week!</li>
    <li> Favorite product of mine.</li>
    <li> Awesome. Very smooth and melts easily. I added some raw mango butter, pure sunflower oil and key lime essential oil to make lip balm along with some other stuff. Great product. Will definitely buy more of this product.</li>
    <li> I love the way this makes my skin heal and moisturize.  I also like the added benefits of a sunscreen that isn&#x27;t toxic and it also keeps biting insects at bay longer than the mosquito repellents on the market and no deet to make me sick.  I have found no other product that works as well at this for softening calluses on my feet and the pain relief for both my feet and hands is very good too.  This feels greasy until it absorbs into my skin but it won&#x27;t leave stains on clothing or bedding if you want to put it all over your body for an at home spa treatment.</li>
    <li> Shea butter has basically replaced all my other lotions and even my sunscreen if I won&#x27;t be outside for hours. It hydrates wonderfully, helps dispel minor acne and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy like some lotions and soaps I&#x27;ve tries in the past. As a plus for using it as sunscreen, it also helped keep me warm when I went swimming in a cooler pool.</li>
    <li> It is big wich i like. But it dosen&#x27;t smell good.</li>
    <li> Very good for my hair...</li>
    <li> I had better luck with this same product but it the one labeled &amp;#34;Product of Ghana&amp;#34;.  This label says &amp;#34;Product of West Africa&amp;#34; and is too hard.</li>
    <li> its does not smell good. NO shea butter does.  This one came in just a plastic bag was a bit of a mess.</li>
    <li> used mixed with coconut oil, and essential oils for lip balm.  very hard until melted.</li>
    <li> it is broken but it is ok i can use it</li>
    <li> Excellent! IG: @ijamierule</li>
    <li> Item arrived quickly but was melted tremendously and the wrapping was not intact so a lot of the product wasted in the box</li>
    <li> I love African Shea Butter, however this came in a large bag instead of the container as pictured.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t come as shown in picture, it comes in a bag. It smells like shea butter but because it didn&#x27;t come as expected I am a little nervous about it and that is the reason for 3 stars.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Easy to blend w grape seed oil and add favorite scent!! Great for diaper rash, too. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Great product. Id does have strong nutty smell.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected</li>
    <li> What I got looked nothing like what you show in the add. Looks like something made up in someone&#x27;s kicthen.</li>
    <li> My Shea Butter came in a jar Unlike others that said theirs came in a bag. My plastic jar however was cracked at the bottom. Amazon shipped it. No worries I have duct tape. The smell is how ALL shea butter smells and ive been using she butter for over 3 years. Consistency always seems to be different with every different vendor but mainly crumbly.i love it and use it on my skin and 4c hair.</li>
    <li> If you want the product to work well, you have to warm in the microwave for no long than 1 minute. If you don&#x27;t put it in the microwave then it will be very hard to apply to your skin.</li>
    <li> give a nice sheen to your hair.. its a great moisturizer</li>
    <li> Great product in superduper size it&#x27;s hard to get out because it&#x27;s very thick by taking a little bit of it and putting in a small container in warm water will allow you to use it more easily I am currently using it for dry hands as a result of chemotherapy as well as for facial moisturizing love it</li>
    <li> I started using Shea in body butters because of all the skin benefits. I like this the best because of the large container it comes in, better for storing. When I have ordered raw Shea in the past people have mixed it with other things like olive oil before sending it and I felt cheated, it is definitely not the case with this.  I use this on my tattoos and it helps them heal faster, I use it like a chap stick, a hair mask, and mainly in body butters. Smells great and feels wonderful on the skin!</li>
    <li> I loved the product but it was poorly packaged for delivery.  When it arrived it was seeping out of the box it came and of course onto my floor when I brought it in.  It&#x27;s best to order it by itself just in case you get a poor packaging problem like I had.</li>
    <li> This was my first purchase of Shea Butter.  I like it.  I doesn&#x27;t smell the best but it is tolerable.  I mix it with coconut oil and essential oils for a soft skin lotion.  Adding other ingredients masks any unpleasant shea butter aroma.</li>
    <li> My whole family uses this Shea Butter from head to toe!</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and also marks on my hands. I have had very good results with the shea butter. My daughter is also using it now.</li>
    <li> Smell good has the best texture, unparalleled.</li>
    <li> great buy alot of different uses.</li>
    <li> Just started using the product... keeps my skin moisturized all day but can get a bit greasy... love the softness it it gives to my skin. I typically use it after a shower, this replaces my lotion for the most part. Its great and plus it has a lot of benefits for the skin. Also, it shipped pretty fast as well so that&#x27;s also a plus.. will buy again</li>
    <li> This is not raw from the nut!!! Don&#x27;t like it, cause it smells like cocoa butter!!! And it&#x27;s yellow. Raw is white and chunky.... Still works like a charm if you need it!!</li>
    <li> It was just what I expected, very cheap purchase on amazon and a quality, big size.</li>
    <li> Earlier then expected. Sealed n complete...thank u</li>
    <li> Excellent product have been using Shea butter for years, keeps the skin soft especially in the winter.</li>
    <li> better than any lotion out there</li>
    <li> I knew Shea butter as a multi product for my hair skin</li>
    <li> Okay, but I prefer white shea butter</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Was not packaged as pictured - it was in a zip lock bag not a plastic container. It was a good product.</li>
    <li> ...hair, face, lips, feet, cuticles. Doesn&#x27;t smell all that nice but the smell goes away. Can be really greasy. Used for my very dry cracking wintered lips and they are back to normal. I use every night on my feet and they are no longer dry and callused</li>
    <li> my order is yellow shea butter in tub as picture not ivory shea butter in resealable package.!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Thank you! Definitely worth buying.</li>
