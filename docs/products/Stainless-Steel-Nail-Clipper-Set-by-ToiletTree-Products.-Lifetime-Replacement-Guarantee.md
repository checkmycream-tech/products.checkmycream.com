<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Was a gift. Birthday person liked it. Seemed to be good quality.  Nice case.</li>
    <li> Excellent nail clippers and file in a very nice pouch.  This is the second one I ordered.  My husband used mine and wanted one of his own</li>
    <li> This thing is sharp and sturdy and big enough to handle any nail. I love it. I may never need another nail clipper. Great investment.</li>
    <li> SUPER HIGH QUALITY! VERY HAPPY WITH PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> Small and easy to carry in purse with case but they are NOT even close to being sharp. Had to pull them out to clip my nail after snagging it, just one small little snip! And it took forever to do the job. I wasn&#x27;t expecting perfection here but I certainly didn&#x27;t expect this.</li>
    <li> Love that it&#x27;s on prime and it&#x27;s one of the best clippers around</li>
    <li> These are the best nail clippers/nail file combo I have used! The quality is great! They are sturdy, strong and reliable. We would definately buy this product again in the future. Great product!</li>
    <li> I am enjoying this nail clipper as far as doing my finger nails. However, the opening is not big enough in order to clip my toe nails and this is why I bought the product. Guess I bought the wrong product.</li>
    <li> Nice ergonomic design, agreeably large size, good sharp &amp;#34;snap&amp;#34; and clean cut. However, the opening for the nail is too narrow. It&#x27;s frustrating to have to jockey the thing around to get the nail in place, and nails with curvature just don&#x27;t fit well into the slot. I&#x27;d planned to buy several more of these as stocking-stuffers, but having used mine for a few months now, I&#x27;ve changed my mind.</li>
    <li> Nice quality, case keeps it together, was a gift for my son who just started taking care of his own nails(yeah), he likes the set.</li>
    <li> This is a nice high quality nail clipper and file set. The clipper is very sharp and cuts the nails easily and with precision. The file is made of metal so it should last a long time. These are also good to take with you on a trip since it comes with a convenient leather carry case.  I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> Compact, sturdy, very easy to carry! I always need clippers and a nail file- no matter where I go! These are so compact, I can easily carry it in my purse. That way, if there is a &amp;#34;nail&amp;#34; emergency, I don&#x27;t have to chew at it, and am able to handle it. The tools are very sturdy and the holder is sophisticated enough for a man or woman. It&#x27;s a well put together duo.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THESE SO I COULD DO THE NAILS AT MY PLACE OF WORK, I WORKED AT AN ASSISTED LIVING HOME. THE PRODUCT WAS WONDERFUL. I ALSO GAVE SOME OUT AS GIFTS. PLEASE REMEMBER THEY ARE RAZOR SHARP.</li>
    <li> Its not often you come across a product as simple as a nail clipper that warrants praise. This little sucker is the best nail clipper EVER! You could probably trim big-foot&#x27;s toe nails with it! Perhaps such simple but effective technology could also be applied to cut entitlement programs, taxes, lines at airports and check-out counters -- basically anyplace where people congregate. I guess not... but as a nail clipper, its the best one I&#x27;ve ever used. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and in good condition. Material is strong and durable.</li>
    <li> They feel very nice in the hand, more thought was obviously put into their design than your average clipper. Using the sharpened clipper was very nice and it really sliced through my nails like no other, but it did kind of catch on my nails which made it a little annoying to wiggle it around my fingernails. But when it was in position, it cut right through.</li>
    <li> Husband has been looking for good clippers.  He has only used a couple of times, but seems to like them.</li>
    <li> It was obvious from the start that this clipper was quality! It came in a sturdy little leather case and had the clipper and file enclosed. I used the clippers and they did a fantastic job. I did not have to clip and then re-clip like I have had to do with so many other clippers in the past. This did the job right the first time! What a pleasure! Also, great for travel.</li>
    <li> This is a big pair of nail clippers (I call them toenail clippers) I like the fact that they are a brushed material so they are easier to grip. They cut wonderful and I love the small file that comes with it.  They both fit into a nice case for easy storage.</li>
    <li> I received these a week or so ago and I have to say that I really like them. They come in a nice little pouch so you can carry it in your purse. The clippers are sharp and cut my fingernails with no problem. I didn&#x27;t have to tug and pull my nail off. The nail file is a nice added bonus. It is small but does what you need it to do. I love the convenience of having both together in a pouch and you don&#x27;t have to hunt for them. You have everything you need when you cut your nails then you can file them. I would recommend this. It is well made and worth it. Sample received for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Bought this product to help me quit biting nails. Having nail clippers and nail file on the go help me to just clip/file my nails wen i wld normally have bitten it. The product is small enough and the provided pouch allows you to carry it with you daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clipper and the file are both sturdy and well made. Cuts even the smallest of nails (product of years of biting). Have had this TT product for a week and already see an improvement in my nails :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five stars.</li>
    <li> The nail clipper and file are excellent. They are well-packaged in a leather case.</li>
    <li> I have not found a ToiletTree Product I didn&#x27;t like. And I am very pleased to say I LOVE both the Stainless Steel Nail Clipper with Nail File &amp; Pouch and Slant Tip Stainless Steel Tweezers  The Stainless Steel Nail Clipper with Nail File and Pouch looks very classy. The pouch helps keep the clippers and file all in one place. The nail clippers are of very high quality. They cut my nails nice and smoothly, no snags. They worked very well on both my toe nails and my finger nails.  The Slant Tip Stainless Steel Tweezers are amazing too. Very high quality again and work so smoothly. I love that I am able to pluck my brows without have to tug at the hair or pinch my skin all the time. The shape of the tweezers work very nicely for grabbing the unwanted hair with no problems.  I love that the tweezers actually fit into the pouch for the clippers. That way I can keep them all in one place.  If you&#x27;re looking for something make of high quality material and with a Lifetime Warranty I would highly suggest you check out the \\&quot;Grooming Line\\&quot; by ToiletTree Products.  -----------------  Disclaimer / Disclosure: I received a free sample to facilitate my review.

    <li> If you are looking for a nice nail clipper and nail file, this is it. It came in a really nice case. I mean, really nice! I&#x27;ve used the clippers a couple times now and no complaints here. The clippers seem to be really durable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount for my honest review.</li>
    <li> Works really week with numb fingers. Sharp and holds the nail well. Other hand does not slip. Worth it! It is hard to work with handicapped hands! Good investment.</li>
    <li> Excellent products, efficient delivery.  Cut nails instead of chewing them!  The clippers &amp; the file were well worth the price--also a handy little carrying case is included.</li>
    <li> These clippers are almost straight across with not much of a radius on the cutting edge. They cut ok but are only good for the thumb and big toe nails.</li>
    <li> This clipper has a much better mechanical advantage than other run-of-the-mill nail clippers and the cutting edge is finer and stronger as well.  The cutting slot is rather narrow making it difficult to apply to the curved edge of ones nails.  The file is rather tiny &#x27;though  adequate enough.  A wider blade would make for better control while filing.  I wish the rivet had a hole like most other clippers so it could be mounted on a key chain.  The case is rather bulky; a finer sheath matching the slick style of the cutter would be an improvement.  My 28 year old son tried it and felt the same as I did about its pros and cons.  All in all, the cutter edge and power advantage make this a worthwhile purchase.</li>
    <li> This nail clipper and file are excellent. Good design for easy grip...High quality. They cut thick nails very easy.  I highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> My reason for choosing this clipper was twofold.  First, we needed a clipper that wasn&#x27;t dull &amp; could handle thicker nails.  Second, I was hoping the larger size would help my nine year old son be able to learn to clip his own nails.  He has a tremor so his fine motor skill is sometimes limited.  Great clipper on both counts!!</li>
    <li> nail file way to short! where are these manufactured...China?</li>
    <li> I bought this item to replace a clipper/file combo that I have had for 30 years. I am in a wheelchair, so I occasionally break or split nails, and I need something I can carry with me all the time. This little combo is small enough to be very portable. I suppose it could be better if it was flatter, but then the clippers wouldn&#x27;t work for toes, and that would reduce the marketability, so it&#x27;s understandable the maker would want to keep as wide a market as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The file is small, but it works great, with almost an emery board surface for keeping a very soft finish for nails. The clippers are wide and very sharp, and the entire combination remains small enough to be easily portable in a bag hanging from my armrest. It should fit easily in a purse also, or even a pocket, though it might be a little inconvenient carried that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s a nice product, and very handy. It comes with a guarantee, which is unusual for almost any product these days. This is just what I was looking for...</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift so I haven&#x27;t used it.  However it seems well made.  I received my order promptly and the price was right.</li>
    <li> I train jiu-jitsu and MMA, so I am constantly needing to make sure my nails are trim and not sharp. This kit works well. Easy to store in my gear bag. Seems like good quality material that will last me a while. Just wish it would have been cheaper (but I know sometimes you get what you pay for).</li>
    <li> love these, could have been smaller, but worth the purchase.  Bought two pairs one for me and the other one for spouse.</li>
    <li> The clipper is very sharp.  It takes very little effort to press for a cut.  The handy filer is light and easy to handle as well.  The pair is perfect.  However, I wish that the clipper comes in also petite size since I&#x27;m a small framed person.  The blade is big for my nails and the handle can be shorter for my hand.  A petite size blade will give an easier cutting angle plus a more fit arch for ladies&#x27; nails.  As proportion, a shorter handle is easier for small hand movement/handling. I hope to see such offer in the near future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case is an extra nice to have.  The black color and design look neat and attractive.  I don&#x27;t need to worry about being scratched by the blade if I need to search the clipper randlomly in my cosemtic bag.</li>
    <li> These nail clippers are very high quality and the included nail file and nice case is a nice bonus to keep the clippers stored in. They have stayed very sharp over the past month of using the clippers where as in the past I&#x27;ve always noticed my nail clippers quickly getting tiny nicks in them that dull their ability to clip. These Stainless Steel Nail Clippers haven&#x27;t given me that problem at all! Plus, I really like the matte finish and subtle styling differences that make these clippers definitely high quality and nice clippers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received a Bamboo Towel Rack for free in exchange for a review on my blog A Mom&#x27;s Take. The opinions above are my own and no compensation was received.</li>
    <li> This is the smoothest clipper I have ever used.  Not a harsh snapping clip which flings the nail piece across the room.  Also like the carrying case that it comes in, wish I could take it on a plane when I travel but I don&#x27;t want TSA to confiscate.  For now just using it in the bathroom at home.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my husband.  He said the clippers are huge and do not cut like regular clippers but the nail file is great.</li>
    <li> design is suppose to help but is really a hinderance. the pin holding the lever to the pin won&#x27;t stay in. would not purchase again, or recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is a set designed for a man that likes nice hands and taking care of his nails. The curve on the clippers has less arch and is much better sutied for larger hands. Sharp cutter and it feels hefty. The fle is equally appreciated and well built.</li>
    <li> Quality materials, nicely packaged in a convenient carry pouch.  Purchased two as gifts; the male recipients were very happy with the product as the clipper and file are perfect for their basic nail maintenance needs. I should have gotten one for myself to keep in my pocketbook!!</li>
    <li> Very good. Very sharp. They cut the nail very smoothly. The seem very sturdy.</li>
    <li> What sets these nail clippers apart from the competition (besides the lifetime warranty) is that they are so comfortable to hold. They are heavy and very sturdy without being cumbersome. Not only that, but they clip through the thickest nails with ease while clipping the minutest pieces of nail with precision. These will be the last nail clippers you ever buy! Plus as a bonus they come in their own little case with a very nice nail file, too.</li>
    <li> These clippers are quite good and the file, while small is large enough to be useful.  the only drawback I&#x27;ve found is the size of the case.  It&#x27;s much larger than needed and I&#x27;d prefer a smaller one to drop in a purse or small bag.</li>
    <li> These nail clippers cut cleanly with minimum pressure needed.  The file is high-quality and the pouch is a handy way to keep both tools together.  Recommended!</li>
    <li> I bought 9 of these for stocking stuffers for the men in our family.  I have gotten positive feedback that they work great and are very sharp.  They come in a nice leather pouch for putting in your pocket or drop kit.  Amazon had a great price, too!</li>
    <li> Best clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Somewhere in size between fingernail and toenail clippers but easy to handle and use, and they are very sharp.  The file is understandably small to fit in the pouch, but it&#x27;s also very good.  The pouch is ideal for keeping them together.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I have always had the dull and boring 1.99 drugstore clippers.  So I did a little searching and tried these out. Mainly for 3 reasons&lt;br /&gt;1. Sharpend cutters&lt;br /&gt;2. Price&lt;br /&gt;3. Stainless Steel&lt;br /&gt;I have never used sharpened clippers before, oh wow!  I had to show my wife. (I got the eyebrow raise in surprise) She thought I got them for her.  Well no.  I may have to order another set.  But they clip both my finger and toe nails nicely.  I have STRONG toe nails, these just smooth on through them with no issues.  I do like the little carry case, fits nicely in my shaving kit.  If you are searching and don&#x27;t want to climb up the price scale to far with fingernail clippers, then I highly recommend these.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;They will leave and edge on your nail where the cutting occurerd.  Meaning you will have to use the file abit to round out some of the cutting edges on your nails.&lt;br /&gt;Also, your nails WILL go FLYING!  I cut mine now out on the front deck. Cutting these in your bedroom will definatley piss off your spouse. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a great product.  Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve gone through many a finger nail clippers as a household. They always become dull or misshapen(and cut funny). This clipper however, is by far the nicest we&#x27;ve ever come across and works SO much faster. you can feel how nice it is when you pick it up, and even more so when you use it. the included nail file is fantastic as well. Haven&#x27;t had to use the lifetime replacement guarantee, though it only has been a short time.</li>
    <li> It is hard to get excited about nail clippers but these are the sharpest easiest cutting clippers.  The basic idea is the same as any clipper....you squeeze, it cuts the nail.  But the sharp blades make the cut smooth and easy through thicker nails.  The finish is a dark gray and looks well made.  The file is compact and easy to use for a man who doesn&#x27;t want to carry around a woman&#x27;s nail file.  I like that the file is all metal, and won&#x27;t likely wear down.</li>
    <li> Well made and great quality.  It comes with really nice leather case and good quality file . highly recommended .</li>
    <li> I must have looked at dozens of nail clippers before I decided to just buy something. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with these. As a recovering nail biter, I had little love for clippers I&#x27;ve used in the past, mostly because it seemed easier to just bite them than try to wrangle clippers that seemed to crush more than cut. Not these bad boys. Very sharp, cut clean, don&#x27;t bend/warp the nail while cutting and come with a handy file. Both pieces fit in a carrier that seems cheap, but doesn&#x27;t need to be fancy. Very happy with the purchase and would enthusiastically recommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> Really... just buy these right now. I have searched my whole life for a decent pair of finger nail clippers and they have all sucked.  These are perfect. Guaranteed to change your life.</li>
    <li> My husband is legally blind and has difficulty with cheaper clippers, .  He is able to use this one with no trouble and is excited to again be in control of trimming and cutting his own nails.</li>
    <li> These clippers are good and sharp but I didn&#x27;t like the shape that they cut my nails. Also, a little too big for me.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. I recommend that Nail Clipper!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is comfortable, durable, thin and beautiful protector. I would buy again in the future!</li>
    <li> I usually buy a nail clipper at walmart every 2-3 years . Glad i did not this time.  And don&#x27;t think I will need to replace this on for many years. very nice - works great.</li>
    <li> Nice case to keep the items together. Nice shape and feel to the clipper and nail file. Sturdy and easy to use</li>
    <li> Cutting accuracy is not good for the price. Same quality can be found cheaper at any grocery store.  I was willing to  pay more to see if this tool would be better than normal.  It wasn&#x27;t.  it only cost more.  Save your money..</li>
    <li> The nail clippers are very poor quality and very flimsy.  I was hoping for a good solid pair of sturdy steel nail clippers to put in our back packs-but these were just a disappointment. I am sure after a single use they will break.  Very disappointed in the nail clippers and the case they came in was very flimsy and poor quality as well. Sorry I do not recommend this product at all.</li>
    <li> What can I say? Everything exactly as I wanted. Could not be better. Clipper is very sharp and does not leave burrs.</li>
    <li> Nice quality.  Cuts the nails with ease and then the file works nicely to remove the sharpness of the nails.  Works best after a shower.</li>
    <li> I am a quality nut.  This clipper set is something that i find suits my needs.  It is well made and works as expected.  There are no issues with the teeth missing eachother or dull blades. It&#x27;s a clean simple cut as it should be. The case is ok but not what i need.( i don&#x27;t need it) No problems with any of these items. file is small ( short ).</li>
    <li> This is a very nice nail clipper set that comes in a holder that is so nice for travel!! High quality and has a lifetime warranty!! :))</li>
    <li> it felt different compared to other nail clippers i cut my nails fast and easy and its great for on the go you can store in ur purse or pockets i love the carrying case i can take it with me anywhere even fit it in my purse i also really like how sharp the clipper is. it cuts my nail smoothly with no hassle compared to other nail clippers ive tried before</li>
    <li> not very sharp, to big abd bulky for finger nails.  To big to get into corners of finger nails.  Very easy to leave hang nails.</li>
    <li> These nailclippers are hands down, the best I&#x27;ve ever used! The finish on them leaves them feeling so smooth to the touch! They clip my nails with ease and precision! The nail file is especially handy as it helps me keep my cuticles healthy. I love the pouch it comes with, I&#x27;m always one to lose nail clippers, so it&#x27;s nice having a case to put them in when I&#x27;m done using them! It always helps keep the nail file clean and without nicks and dents. The lifetime quaruntee gives me peace of mind that if something DOES happen, which I doubt, as they are built perfectly, that it will be fixed!</li>
    <li> These are amazing. They are nice and sharp and I love that they have a matte finish on the steel. They are extremely comfortable to hold onto and do a really good job of not leaving your nails with any sharp edges. The nail file is on the smaller side when comparing it to other metal files that I own but it is such a nice quality. I use it to file down my nail wraps and it does the job quickly and efficiently. Cleaning the clippers and the file have been a breeze. I just wipe them down with alcohol wipes. The carrying case holds both the nail clippers and the file and is small enough to fit into my makeup bag. I have no doubts that these will last much longer than my usual $2 drugstore pair.</li>
    <li> Love this combo! Perfect size for my purse, works well and the case keeps me from losing it as well! Nail file is great, and works awesome too! Would highly recommend this product! Plus, it&#x27;s from a company I trust and love!</li>
    <li> These are GREAT!  Nail clippers are somethine we all need, I got tired of my five and dime pairs every 3 mo.  these are well made and easy to use this is my second pair the last ones I bought 7 years ago!  That&#x27;s VALUE!</li>
    <li> I got tired of the quality of nail clippers being sold these days - dull blades causing split nails.  rusting. falling apart.  These babies were a little pricey I thought, and the finish looks/feels great.  My real concern is I don&#x27;t like the curvature of the blade very much - a little too flat and a little too large.  Could double as toenail clippers I suppose.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always looking for good clippers that not only cut but are easy to hold and don&#x27;t fall apart when you use them. These fit the bill. The clippers work great for me - both for finger nails and toe nails. I highly recommend these to anyone who is looking for a reasonably priced set of nail clippers that do what they&#x27;re supposed to do - cut nails!</li>
    <li> Nice and sharp.  Seem a little big for fingernail clipper but not too big and work well on toe nails.  My husband likes them.</li>
    <li> The Fingernail Clipper is a little too wide. I would have liked it better if it were narrower as a result I&#x27;m back to using my old one. I will say the clipper is sharp and the file is fine.</li>
    <li> I had looked for finger nail clippers that cut well.  These do.  Also ordered the toe nail nipper by the same manufacturer.  Both are really helpful and work for me.  The nail file is good also even though it is also steel.</li>
    <li> Pouch and file are great...clipper is NOT so great.&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully I will be able to find a clipper small enough that works great to fit into the pouch.&lt;br /&gt;The clipper opening is too close together. Width is okay but too close to get a curved nail into it.</li>
