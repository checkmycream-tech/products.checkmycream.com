      <li>She liked it.</li>
      <li>Wonderful delicate smell and great purchase!</li>

      <li>The wash smells more ti me like whipped cream, and the lotion for me has a hint of cinnamon to it.</li>
      <li>I was given this gift set, and love the fragrance.</li>
      <li>arrived fast, smells great.  </li>
      <li>My over the counter lotions and shower shampoos are much better.</li>
      <li>but I love the scent.</li>
      <li>Love philosophy.</li>
      <li>She said the scent was very nice, not overpowering and the lather of the body wash was great, a little goes a long way and the lotion was wonderful.</li>
      <li>Love the fresh cream!</li>

      <li>I wear it every single day &amp; get very nice complements.</li>
      <li>Almost like frosted cinnamon roll...wish the lotion was not as sweet.</li>
      <li>Got exactly what we wanted, on time and as shown.</li>
      <li>Arrived really fast, too!</li>
      <li>It barely has a smell at all, and the smell it does have is just, well, really blah and not really that great smelling.</li>
      <li>The lotion and body wash are lightly scented, not strong at all, which many people prefer.</li>
      <li>She has never used Philosophy brand before so this was a real treat for her.</li>
      <li>Other than that, love it.</li>
      <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is the lotion doesn&#x27;t have the same wonderful scent as the shower gel,it has a strange sour smell.</li>

<li> Just something to consider if you have trouble with your grip or lack strength in your hands.</li>
<li> The only reason for not giving 5 stars was she said the containers were very difficult for her to squeeze which makes sense after such and invasive surgery</li>
<li> and the nurse apparently had a difficult time squeezing the bottles as well.</li>

    <li> One of my friends has been like a miracle worker for me, and means the world to me, so I gave her one of these recently. She saw the package and LOVED it. The set was a really nice way to tell someone how much you care about them. The lotion and body wash are lightly scented, not strong at all, which many people prefer. I have used Philosophy products for a long time and was happy to see this one. I would definitely give this gift again.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT!!  MY NIECE LOVES IT!!</li>
    <li> I sent this as a get well gift to my sister in law, she was recovering from a multi level spinal fusion and I thought some special body wash and lotion would make her feel loved and it worked. She said she loved the product. She has never used Philosophy brand before so this was a real treat for her. She said the scent was very nice, not overpowering and the lather of the body wash was great, a little goes a long way and the lotion was wonderful. The only reason for not giving 5 stars was she said the containers were very difficult for her to squeeze which makes sense after such and invasive surgery so she had her visiting nurse assist her and the nurse apparently had a difficult time squeezing the bottles as well. Just something to consider if you have trouble with your grip or lack strength in your hands.</li>
    <li> Love this set! It makes a perfect gift for anyone. The wash smells more ti me like whipped cream, and the lotion for me has a hint of cinnamon to it. Almost like frosted cinnamon roll...wish the lotion was not as sweet. But, with all Philosophy products, both are Luxe , and feel amazing.</li>
    <li> Good product but not as good as the original Philosophy perfume!</li>
    <li> Not as expected. Their has been so much hype with this product and scent, I thought I would give it a try and was very disappointed. My over the counter lotions and shower shampoos are much better.</li>
    <li> Great results with regular use.</li>
    <li> I ordered this from QVC, this formulation smells quite different from the QVC formulation. I&#x27;m not sure why, but I won&#x27;t be ordering again.</li>
    <li> The only problem with this product is that the bottles are difficult to squeeze. Other than that, love it. Would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I really love the shower gel, it smells amazing!!! My favorite shower gel now! The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is the lotion doesn&#x27;t have the same wonderful scent as the shower gel,it has a strange sour smell. I will probably only buy the the gel alone.</li>
    <li> Nice packaging and great price. I will be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> How can you beat :Philosophy at this price?</li>
    <li> My sister loved this gift! Wonderful delicate smell and great purchase!</li>
    <li> The lotion is not as strongly scented as the shower gel but I love the scent.</li>
    <li> What can I say except-I cannot get enough of this fragrance made by Philosophy and sold by Amazon! I wear it every single day &amp; get very nice complements. Very light, fresh fragrance. Arrived really fast, too!</li>
    <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried a Philisophy product, try this one. I bought this for a friend&#x27;s birthdat and she loves it!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get the crazy hype over this product. I had to try it after hearing about it for so long - and I have to say - I&#x27;m colossally underwhelmed! It barely has a smell at all, and the smell it does have is just, well, really blah and not really that great smelling. I expected to be WOWed...and I was not, at all.</li>
    <li> arrived fast, smells great.  good buy.</li>
    <li> Bought as a Christmas gift for my grandmother, who loves Philosophy products. Got exactly what we wanted, on time and as shown.</li>
    <li> I was given this gift set, and love the fragrance. My only dislike is at the bottles are tough to squeeze, especially in the shower. I like this product a lot, and plan to reorder when I run low</li>
    <li> All I can say about this product is that it is just AWFUL. I wasted my money and time I will be never buying this product again. The body wash smells like chemicals and the lotion has no scent to it. It just awful I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Love the fresh cream!</li>
    <li> She liked it. Love philosophy.</li>
