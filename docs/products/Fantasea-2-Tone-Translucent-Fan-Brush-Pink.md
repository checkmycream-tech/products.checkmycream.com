      <li>This brush worked fine for chemical peels.</li>
      <li>The fan brush is cute and works exactly how it says it will!</li>
      <li>This brush is made in cheap nylon material.   </li>

      <li>I do still have it, but if I do not find a reasonable use for it, meaning effective, it goes</li>
      <li>It works and has a nice price tag, but the brush that came didn&#x27;t have the smooth bristles like the picture, it also doesn&#x27;t hold much of the material when using it.  </li>
      <li>The brush is good and soft.</li>

      <li>A brush is a brush, right?</li>

      <li>Pass on this and spend a little more money on a better brush..</li>
      <li>I did like it very much.  </li>
      <li>Good little brush.</li>
      <li>A good brush, but I wish it were a little stiffer.</li>
      <li>Brush has really fine, soft material and if there is one thing I wish I have done differently, then it would have ordered more of these</li>
      <li>The fan turns into fingers with the first use.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d prefer a smaller brush for my face, but for now, this will do :)</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s pretty.</li>
      <li>When it arrived which was exactly 7 days after I ordered it (which is grest because im in Afghanistan).</li>
      <li>I threw it away after first use.</li>
      <li>Works very well with facial peel gel and easily washes clean</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works well. Does what it needs to.</li>
    <li> Love this brush. Shipped to me very fast! This is my 3rd time ordering! I am a licensed aesthetician and swear by this fan brush!</li>
    <li> I like this product the first 4 months. After a while the bristles separated into 3 v-shaped groupings and stayed that way. Had to get rid of it. It worked well for its purpose initially.</li>
    <li> This brush was great for applying masks to my daughter&#x27;s spa party guests! Very soft!</li>
    <li> A good brush, but I wish it were a little stiffer. It is a wide, but thin, soft brush. I use it for at home glycolic peels and have had no problems. It&#x27;s good for larger areas like forehead, cheeks, forearms, chest. Difficult to use in smaller areas like close to eye area.</li>
    <li> Cheap brush, and turns out to be useless.  I bought three, and ended up tossing them all away after one use.</li>
    <li> The bristles separated.</li>
    <li> I received my package yesterday and cannot wait until my peel arrives so that I can begin to use it. Awesome timing!</li>
    <li> My brush separates into 3 different sections &amp; doesn&#x27;t keep it&#x27;s fan shape when I use it to apply an acid peel solution.</li>
    <li> I love the look and feel of this brush, It cleans with ease and does just what it is suppose to do</li>
    <li> Not bought for myself, but my sister loves the product.</li>
    <li> It looks much prettier when you&#x27;re holding it than in the picture and has soft bristles! I&#x27;d definitely buy it again!</li>
    <li> I got this fan brush for adminstering acid peels on myself. It has excellent coverage and is still perfect, no cracks, discoloration, after a year. I also use it for my enzyme peels and my masks...  It&#x27;s so hard to find a pink fan brush so I&#x27;m glad it not only looks cute but works well, too.</li>
    <li> The brush is attractive but when you dip it in a liquid, the bristles separate into clumps and it&#x27;s impossible to spread anything evenly onto the skin.  I couldn&#x27;t use it even once.  Pass on this and spend a little more money on a better brush..</li>
    <li> I thought I could use this for peels or masks, not the case at all.  Maybe for makeup application but I didn&#x27;t need one for that.  I just used 100% cotton round to apply my peel.</li>
    <li> I just used the product this morning. And once it is wet the hairs clump together and do not spread the product evenly on your skin. What a waste of money. I would go with a different brand and pay the extra bucks. Very cheap product. Not happy with it. I guess you get what you pay for. I thought all fan brushes were the same but definitely not!</li>
    <li> This brush is made in cheap nylon material.   When the brush is wet, the bristles seperated into 4 sections. They were no longer a single \\&quot;fan-like\\&quot; brush, which makes it impossible to achieve a uniform application. Definitely not for use with a clear liquid. Cheap brush, and turns out to be useless.   Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed in this product. Having purchased a fan brush a couple of years ago through another company, I was unaware of the striking differences in quality available. A brush is a brush, right? Well, yes and no. This is indeed a lovely two-tone pink brush; however, it is entirely ineffective in spreading my facial products (e.g. masks, peels) evenly as the bristles have a tendency of clumping together....resembling a rake more than a fan. This leads to spotty application and the need to constantly reapply. Not good at all. I would not purchase this brush again.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush a while back and meant to leave a review about it.  I haven&#x27;t changed brushes, purely from laziness, so obviously this brush works adequately - however - the brush itself is quite large and takes some finessing when going around your eye, nose, temple area.  I&#x27;d prefer a smaller brush for my face, but for now, this will do :)</li>
    <li> It works and has a nice price tag, but the brush that came didn&#x27;t have the smooth bristles like the picture, it also doesn&#x27;t hold much of the material when using it.  Might want to look for higher quality for anything other than a project u need a disposable brush for.</li>
    <li> This brush worked fine for chemical peels. The bristles do clump a little bit, but the brush still gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I purhased this fan brush because I needed one to do my at home chemical peels. When it arrived which was exactly 7 days after I ordered it (which is grest because im in Afghanistan). I thought it would be hard but it wasnt. It was very soft and looked exactly like it did in the photo.</li>
    <li> This brush was recommend with the purchase of a skin peel, although the directions for the peel advise using gauze. The brush is nice and soft but not suitable for use with a peel that needs to be rubbed into the skin. This would be better suited for use with a creamy clay mask instead.</li>
    <li> This brush was less expensive and I can see a difference in it from other brushes I purchased, but it is not a bad brush.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush to apply a chemical peel but it was hard to do. This brush separates when used and didn&#x27;t allow for even distribution of product.  I would not buy this brush again - in fact I have to buy another one that actually will work.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchased this brush to apply an acid peel however it doesn&#x27;t spread the product that well but it will do for the price. I also had to file the edge it had a jagged corner near the bristles.</li>
    <li> And it works great for applying my monthly glyco-lac peel. I was looking for a brush to put my peel on more surface faster so it would be easier to time consistently, and this works just fine.</li>
    <li> It was the perfect brush to use to apply the perfect image serum.  It was very easy to clean and dried very quickly.</li>
    <li> This brush came up as a suggestion as a chemical peel applicator brush.  I ordered it, along with another from the same company.  I use this brush for make-up application only.  The bristles are SO soft, they don&#x27;t stand up when wet (I washed my brush before any use).  If you need a great highlight brush, this is the one for you.  Don&#x27;t purchase to use as a chemical peel brush though, you won&#x27;t be satisfied.</li>
    <li> This is a cheaply made brush for a cheap price.  I will not get much use out of it but it is ok when all my other brushes are being cleaned and dryed.  This brush is USELESS when wet.  Do NOT purchase if paning to use it with liquid products.  The brush&#x27;s hairs sread put and clump together in about 6 pieces so it makes appilction very streaky and uneven.  Only buy if plaining to use with powder products.  Shipped fast and was delivered on time.</li>
    <li> This brush needs to be fuller. It fans out as needed but it separates in to think sections making it difficult to use on my face. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> good product. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT &amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;Brush with high quality and soft in addition to the cheap price and I would advise .....Thanks</li>
    <li> I gave it 2 stars as it&#x27;s mega soft however since first used it has separated into three sections....sometimes 4 during use. When I&#x27;m putting something on I have to apply repeatedly due to the gaps caused by the separating. I have tried to fix this problem by washing it and laying it flat to dry and even pressing it dry between two paper towels , but it still happens.</li>
    <li> Great Brush works well, just the products used on the brush were not so great, but this brush works fine.</li>
    <li> We ordered these brushes to use during our facials and they are perfect. The handles are short enough to fit in the disinfectant jar and close the lid. Bristles are very soft.</li>
    <li> Good price exactly what I needed !</li>
    <li> Product arrived in timely manner as promised. Great for application of chemical peels to the skin, and may also be used for application of other products, if so desired. Nice brush, soft.</li>
    <li> ... but I found this when I was purchasing Glycolic Acid for my face and I knew that this brush is what salons use. However, as soon as the brush was wet - the bristles seperated into 4 sections. They were no longer a single \\&quot;fan-like\\&quot; brush. I wish I would have known.</li>
    <li> The brush is good and soft. I try to put on Salicylic Acid Gel Peel by using this brush. Its just not right. All brush hair will sticky together.</li>
    <li> i love the bush ! it does a perrrrfect job of applying the peel i am very pleased - it holds in the acid so its not dripping all over too very very great brush for peeling</li>
    <li> I have been using it to apply masks on my face and it does a pretty good job.  Well-made brush. I did like it very much.  And I do recommend it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t want to invest a bunch of money on a fan brush, so this one was good buy.  Comes with a protective cover when not in use.  Does the job!</li>
    <li> Very cheap...not happy at all with this...should have listened to the reviews...such a flimsy piece of garbage...waste of money....definitely not for applying any peels or mask solutions....</li>
    <li> This is a good brush to use with my skin peel. I gather the bristles together to make it a little easier to put on.</li>
    <li> I like that it was cheap but the synthetic bristles aren&#x27;t of a good quality. I only use it to apply lactic acid but would prefer natural bristles... Worth the $3 overall</li>
    <li> Great product. Prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> I use this for glycolic peel and love the way it applies the acid the brush has held up after many uses so I am pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> washes well, even spray with acholol and is okay. also don&#x27;t use that much, only on home clients such as friends and family that i don&#x27;t charge fo facials</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. Ita not horrible and gets the job done. Its not great though and feels flimsy. For the given price it Works for me as I only use it once a week.</li>
    <li> I bought this for glycolic acid application. Skip it. The fan turns into fingers with the first use. I started using my fingers and they work just fine.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Every time i have mask treatment, i can easily apply the mask onto my face with it. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I ordered two of these brushes for Public Clinic that I have to do for my school.  I only received one but emailed the company and they immediately sent the other one out.  Great Customer Service!</li>
    <li> it served it&#x27;s purpose as a fan brush...it helped apply the skin Obsession Jessner&#x27;s Chemical Peel Kit Anti-aging and Anti-acne Skin</li>
    <li> Works very well with facial peel gel and easily washes clean</li>
    <li> A very light brush that I use for covering uneven skin tone with my foundation.  Works well for blending.</li>
    <li> i like it and i don&#x27;t even like pink--more later</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this product. Feels vey soft on my skin and good quality for the price. I needed this item for my peel and so far I am satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> Once wet, this brush separates into several sections, which makes it almost impossible to achieve a uniform application.  Definitely not for use with a clear liquid.</li>
    <li> I bought this to apply peels on my face and it doesnt work at all it just clumps up :( i never tried to use it for make up though...</li>
    <li> When I use this brush the bristles separate and clump together. I threw it away after first use. It was a cheapo, in this instance I got what I paid for!</li>
    <li> When this product get&#x27;s wet the bristles seperate so it doesn&#x27;t work effeciantly.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very annoying. So it&#x27;s trash.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money. $$$XXX</li>
    <li> Good for powder blushes that are heavily pigmented (such as NARS&#x27; &amp;#34;Exhibit 9&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Orgasm&amp;#34;). However, even after the fan-coating the blush needs blending, so its not for those 5-minute application days when your almost late to work. I am going to use it for peels instead and see if it works like it says. Will update then.</li>
    <li> Perhaps I just got a dud, but the bristles on my particular brush splayed out after just one use. My brush was cleaned and stored properly. Not sure what happened.</li>
    <li> This is a super soft makeup brush! Easy to use,and a great addition to my makeup kit. For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> There is nothing not to like about this brush that I can figure out.  Plus I think its going to last practically 10 years due to the plastic and metal.  No color fading after a peel that was insanely strong.  From New York where the company is probably older and well established.  I usually like stuff from New York companies though of course its from china (manufactured).</li>
    <li> I use this with my ben Nye powder and it works really great. easy grip and fits in my makeup kit.</li>
    <li> Good quality for the price.  Would definently buy again.  Works for what I need it for and has held up well.</li>
    <li> very nice and well made brush and it works well for putting on masks and peels so you dont get your hand dirty</li>
    <li> Use for facial ,ask at home application.  Easy to clean (rinse with cool water and if necessary use cosmetic brush cleaner) and works on variety of masks (hydrating, peel, etc.).  Very pretty and the handle feels comfortable on hand.  Will fit in most brush holders.  Lay flat to dry. Bristles have not come out which was really surprising for the cost.  All in all good quality purchase for price.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed for a chemical peel.</li>
    <li> its a little to soft to be effective. Perhaps its user error.</li>
    <li> I have been getting regual (facial) peel treatments in the spas.  I have decided recently to start doing my own peels at home and for that purpose I needed a good brush.  I came across this brush on Amazon and really liked it because of the the two color design.  I looked attractive (and girlie) and even if someone saw it in my bathroom it would not be offputting.  Brush has really fine, soft material and if there is one thing I wish I have done differently, then it would have ordered more of these so I can have spares on hand.</li>
    <li> this was good for the price</li>
    <li> I use it all the time to apply Salicylic Acid 20% Gel Peel, 30ml  on my face. It woks perfectly.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty big fan brush and it&#x27;s so soft on my face! I love it and I love the colour of it.</li>
    <li> but thats not the fasult of the product i just assumed i would get the size i ordered not a large.</li>
    <li> I love t his brush.  I&#x27;m glad I ordered it with the acid peel and use it for that purpose</li>
    <li> Completely useless. The bristles clump up once wet and are way too soft.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it, it is not good for applied a chemical peeling in your face.</li>
    <li> Great soft face brush. Perfect for masks &amp; easy to clean. Awesome price too!</li>
    <li> Little on the sparse side. I use this brush to apply my peels at home. Find myself dipping more than normal to obtain product...really, Its a brush..It does the job, haven&#x27;t lost any bristles and it&#x27;s pretty. Point blank period!</li>
    <li> Good little brush. It does the job and dries quickly. It is also small and can be packed if traveling.</li>
    <li> Very thin fan, several of the bristles have fallen out... not as expected.</li>
    <li> I use this to brush off little specks that sometimes get on my face when applying eyeshadow.  It sweeps them off without messing up anything else.</li>
    <li> This brush is perfect for applying glycolic (gel), just be careful not to use too much pressure and the bristles are still and will fling glycolic where you least want it... like your eyes :) I have been lucky enough to never have that happen, but upon first use I could see it happening to anyone.</li>
    <li> Okay, Okay... I know. It is cheap, but even at that, it is not worth the shipping. I still have not found it worthwhile. It is actually very rare that you need a fan brush to begin with. I thought it would work with my peels... but not so. I do still have it, but if I do not find a reasonable use for it, meaning effective, it goes bye-bye soon. I&#x27;d say, don&#x27;t waste your time with this, or your money. You probably do not need it at all.</li>
    <li> I think this is less than two dollars and you get your money&#x27;s worth. I used it for two peels and it came apart. Next time I will make more of an investment.</li>
    <li> Not too bad for a cheap brush. I use it to apply Salicily Acid peel.</li>
    <li> The fan brush is cute and works exactly how it says it will!</li>
