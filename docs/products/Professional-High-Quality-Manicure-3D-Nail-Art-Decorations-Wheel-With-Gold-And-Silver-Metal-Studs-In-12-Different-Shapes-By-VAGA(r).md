      <li>Overall great value for the purchase.</li>

      <li>received prior to the date listed great product</li>
      <li>They look nice for the price and if you&#x27;re into doing your own nails you&#x27;ll save big by choosing these over going to the salon</li>
      <li>these little gems are great.my grandaughters do their own nails and love them.they can create their own designs</li>
      <li>These are so cuuute and so worth the wait!</li>
      <li>yes the tray is full and the colors are perfect..just like the picture.</li>
      <li>This is a good product however when i recieved it all the studs were disorganized, mixed together</li>
      <li>I like the simple look and these are quite cute ,and sophisticated.</li>
      <li>Exactly as described!</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
      <li>Totally worth what I paid and</li>
      <li>so i can get the right studs.</li>
      <li>These little charms are really cute &amp; fit really well on the nail I really love them.</li>
      <li>Packaged in cute little case as well. :) .</li>
      <li>Shipping took a little long but great price and love these for my nails</li>
      <li>It looks pretty n makes your nail stand out.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t mind the size all that much either!</li>
      <li>they are pretty like picture of stubs, but amount is incorrect.</li>
      <li>love all the different shapes and sizes.</li>
      <li>They stick well with a top coat but would probably last longer with nail glue.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t get EXACTLY what is shown in the picture though.</li>
      <li>They were exactly what I was looking for, and they are just as described in the pictures.</li>
      <li>This is my first time buying stud nail deco</li>
      <li>I will go for better quiality next time</li>
      <li>Good quality too except after a few days of wearing them on your nails the gold will fade off and they&#x27;ll turn silverish.</li>
      <li>it has a secure little case and the top swivels around</li>
      <li>you really should offer the nail glue with this item</li>
      <li>Better quality than I expected  and even though it said it would take over a month to receive</li>
      <li>Love these little accents.</li>
      <li>The shapes were mixed in mine because the lid didn&#x27;t fit well on the storage wheel, allowing the shapes to slide around into different compartments.  </li>
      <li>The case is exactly like the picture also, and it very tiny.</li>
      <li>Very little and cheap bendable product</li>
      <li>It came a week and half early which was a nice surprise, and they apply with regular topcoat or clear polish, I just put a dot of topcoat where I want the bead to go place the bead down and position it with the back of my tweezers and seal over with topcoat</li>
      <li>they were for my daughter and the big hug that I got was thanks enough for me.</li>
      <li>came pretty fast, 2 and a half weeks!!</li>
      <li>and I only used clear nail polish I had for putting it on.</li>
      <li>A tad bit bigger than other jewels but still small enough  to fit multiple on nail.</li>

<li> I thought this is a gem type of thing that the bottom is flat</li>
<li> The stones dont lay flat on the nail... wouldnt rebuy</li>
<li> I had received this earlier than expected, so that was a big plus!</li>
<li> I do have to say that the wheel is REALLY tiny; waaay smaller than expected.</li>
<li> They came earlier then expected too.</li>
<li> The case was way smaller than I expected</li>
<li> Took a long time to get here</li>
<li> Some gems repeat but in different colors they are silver, gold and one section of black gems.</li>
<li> only thing is there was a little  inconsistency.</li>
<li> I received these 2 weeks before the expected delivery date.</li>
<li> Which makes it harder to place them on the fingers.</li>
<li> exacly as I expected.</li>
<li> Faster shipping than expected, but not very many of each thing in the little case as shown in sale picture.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s less than half the size of my iPhone 6.</li>
<li> Half the size of iPhone 5.</li>
<li> a spill ever happens you won&#x27;t have hundreds of little beads all over the place.</li>
<li> nothing will go to waste</li>
<li> Like, instead of the silver rectangles and gold squares, I got silver teardrops and small silver circles.</li>
<li> Small wheel.  </li>

    <li> The case was way smaller than I expected and it took forever to be delivered but they are very nice and just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> This is my first time buying stud nail deco and I love it. It looks pretty n makes your nail stand out. They stayed on my toe nails for about two weeks and I only used clear nail polish I had for putting it on.</li>
    <li> Love these gems! Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> This is a very good product at a great price, it comes exactly like the picture it has a secure little case and the top swivels around so you don&#x27;t ever take the top off which is good just in case a spill ever happens you won&#x27;t have hundreds of little beads all over the place.

    <li> Extremely satisfied! I received these 2 weeks before the expected delivery date. They are very full and all organized nicely. I haven&#x27;t used them yet tho, I&#x27;m waiting on my fake nails so I can put them in use. :)</li>
    <li> I thought this is a gem type of thing that the bottom is flat but it&#x27;s not. Which makes it harder to place them on the fingers. You only have the outer edge to put a glue/polish on. I guess you get what you pay for. I will go for better quiality next time</li>
    <li> Very little and cheap bendable product</li>
    <li> I CANT WAIT TO TRY THEM OUT. THEY CAME IN A NICE SECURE PACKAGE.</li>
    <li> These are so cuuute and so worth the wait! I didn&#x27;t get EXACTLY what is shown in the picture though. Like, instead of the silver rectangles and gold squares, I got silver teardrops and small silver circles. I don&#x27;t mind at all though!! I do have to say that the wheel is REALLY tiny; waaay smaller than expected. It&#x27;s less than half the size of my iPhone 6. I will be buying again so I don&#x27;t mind the size all that much either!</li>
    <li> This is a good product however when i recieved it all the studs were disorganized, mixed together and it was a pain in the neck to fix so i can get the right studs. But i was still happy with it and i got a ton of compliments on my nails.</li>
    <li> A nice set of metal looking nail embellishments. Better quality than I expected  and even though it said it would take over a month to receive I got it in two weeks. Very glad I purchased these instead of paying triple the money at the beauty supply.</li>

    <li> Great assortment. These are actually perfect size to enhance my handmade cards.</li>
    <li> Totally worth what I paid and then some! I think I&#x27;m going to order another 3 for when I run out of these!</li>
    <li> They were easy-to-use and I love the way they make my nails pop.</li>
    <li> received prior to the date listed great product</li>
    <li> I had received this earlier than expected, so that was a big plus! The gems are cute. Some gems repeat but in different colors they are silver, gold and one section of black gems. However, I didn&#x27;t receive any hearts which was upsetting because that is what I thought I would be getting and was what I wanted. I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll use most of them.</li>
    <li> Nice selection of shapes and sizes, but docked a star because the wheel isn&#x27;t well made and some of the shapes looked worn/dull instead of shiny.  The shapes were mixed in mine because the lid didn&#x27;t fit well on the storage wheel, allowing the shapes to slide around into different compartments.  I know this doesn&#x27;t affect the quality of the studs but it really makes it annoying to use.</li>
    <li> Item was delivered on time. they are pretty like picture of stubs, but amount is incorrect. Small wheel.  Half the size of iPhone 5. About 6 different stud designs, silver and gold color. Nice but i don&#x27;t know if I will re purchase. I though it had a heart shape stub but I didn&#x27;t receive that. It had circles, triangles, rectangles, tear drop, diamond, and star.</li>
    <li> The stones dont lay flat on the nail... wouldnt rebuy</li>
    <li> cant wait to use these on my nails</li>
    <li> Faster shipping than expected, but not very many of each thing in the little case as shown in sale picture.</li>
    <li> for fake nail save your stinkin money bro</li>
    <li> love all the different shapes and sizes.</li>
    <li> Great product for nail art</li>
    <li> Nice! Lots of different shapes. Love em!</li>
    <li> Adds the perfect touch to any manicure/pedicure. Love these little accents.</li>

    <li> came pretty fast, 2 and a half weeks!! yes the tray is full and the colors are perfect..just like the picture. only thing is there was a little  inconsistency. i got no hearts and no squares instead i got ovals and and all circles are the same size. also i got duplicates just in a different color. but for the price im happy with what i have. nothing will go to waste</li>
    <li> I take this with me to the nail shop my hands look very good people always looking at my hands ask me who do that.</li>
