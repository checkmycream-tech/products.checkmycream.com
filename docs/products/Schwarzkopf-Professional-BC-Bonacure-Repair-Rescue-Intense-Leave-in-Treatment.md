<li> The bottle was hard to spray</li>
<li> I had a difficult time pushing the pump with one hand.</li>

    <li> Leaves hair feeling soft without an oily, heavy look.</li>
    <li> Came quickly and makes my hair feel healthier. It smells good too</li>
    <li> I have used it for a couple days and I love the way my hair looks. Very shiny and smooth</li>
    <li> Love it, smells like caramel</li>
    <li> Schwarzkopf makes a great product, you can&#x27;t go very wrong with any of their line. The bottle was hard to spray but I think the product is a bit thicker so it doesn&#x27;t spray easily. I had a difficult time pushing the pump with one hand. Leave on Conditioner/Repair spray. Great on the hair!</li>
    <li> I love this products awesome thank you</li>
    <li> The product it&#x27;s self is great, but it gives the same feeling as using conditioner. If you have a good shampoo and conditioner routine, you make not need this product.</li>

    <li> Love this product. I always buy it. I have bleached hair and after shampoo, I can comb tangle free after a few sprays.</li>
    <li> Saved my damaged hair. A+</li>
    <li> an excellent product ... soft and hydrated hair ... I&#x27;m with renewed hair ... in 2 weeks of use I saw an extraordinary result .... I loved this product line ...</li>
    <li> SCHWARZKOPF BONACURE INTENSE LEAVE-IN TREATMENT  SCHWARZKOPF has always been the Rolls-Royce of hair care.  If you do not wish to wait (5-10 minutes after application on clean, towel-dried hair) for the super-intense jar product in cream form (Repair Rescue Treatment for damaged hair) this product -quick spray - no waiting, is excellent.</li>
    <li> Great product, helped my critically damaged hair. I also have very thin hair and after ruin it even more with lots of chemicals this stuff helped a lot to get it a lit bit better.</li>
    <li> I loooovee the bc bonacure repair rescue treatments! but somehow this product didn&#x27;t do much for my hair. Yo have to be very carefull and spray just a little ammount of product or this will weight down your hair and leave a greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> Live in a very dry climate.  Very helpful to curly hair</li>
    <li> My hairdresser uses this product, and since I have fine hair it is hard to find a product that doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair&lt;br /&gt;This works well as a leave in conditioner also</li>
    <li> My hair resurrected from the ashes of over processing, heating, coloring and styling. Thank god I found this product. And very easy to use too! I just spray it on my hair before I blow dry. Less hair fall from untangling hair tangles after I wash it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product if you need protein in your hair.  It takes out tangles very well.  However, I personally need moisture rather than protein, so it is not optimal for my hair.</li>
    <li> It is a good product if you use a flat iron, because it protects the hair. Just don&#x27;t use too much at once or your hair might get oily.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair so soft &amp; shiny. I LOVE it!! It should last a while too since I only have to use 3-4 pumps at a time. Definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> Great product! Smells amazing, and makes my hair incredibly easy to brush.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel stronger!!! LOVE, LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product from the Schwarzkopf Bonacure really nourishes and detangle my relaxed hair.  I totally recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Good one.. perfect fordry hair..</li>
    <li> Best spray in conditioner for my fine, thin hair.  Not heavy</li>
    <li> Perfect, love this product it smells amazing. As soon as I sprayed it on my hair there was instantaneous results that I could see and feel. I would definitely buy this product again along with other products by Schwarzkopf. It really works and the best part is that there is keratin in it..♡♡</li>
    <li> Great lightweight leave in conditioner!</li>
