      <li>I LOVE this product for my faux hawk.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff, have tried others and there is no comparison even in the paul mitchell line.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this!!!!!</li>
      <li>Gives my short hair great body and makes it very easy to blow dry into a great style!</li>
      <li>this is very good when my hair is short.</li>
      <li>so I was so pleased to find this available online.  </li>
      <li>Love this stuff...especially great for short hair.</li>
      <li>Washes out easily too, which is a huge plus.  </li>
      <li>I have fine hair adn</li>
      <li>and if so, I am going to be super bummed!</li>
      <li>Came in quickly and did its job to my hair!</li>
      <li>This product works very well for people who have fine fly away hair, it really keeps it in place with body.</li>
      <li>will help you smooth  </li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t the exact one that u deferred but its working just fine..</li>
      <li>Quick shipping, product as advertised.</li>
      <li>Super hold.  </li>
      <li>Good product to have..be careful not to order the strictly paste</li>
      <li>even more once the product mixes with the natural oils in my hair.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted and it came quickly too.</li>
      <li>However, I keep my hair very moisturized ( not greasy at all, but I do enjoy my pre-pos and steam treatments) and I don&#x27;t think that works with this product; too much slip.</li>
      <li>Just used it for the first time today.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products over the years and most are either too stiff, leave too much residue, aren&#x27;t manageable, etc...  </li>
      <li>Has a long shelf life and easy to use on any length of hair!</li>
      <li>Hair will stand right up and holds very well.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s really oily</li>
      <li>/&gt;Holds really well but still manageable.  </li>
      <li>Only drawback is it&#x27;s not paraben free.</li>
      <li>Love this product, i am a black female with very kinky hair and this lays my edges down so good.</li>
      <li>Works great on my short coarse hair to help keep it styled and laying down.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>But i highly recommend it to anyone with any hair type.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend if you want to be part of the science experiment with me.</li>
      <li>Not hard &amp; stiff like many products</li>
      <li>I am running low on it right now</li>
      <li>This is the only product I have found that will keep my short and fine hair in the spiky style I like.</li>
      <li>Baby-fine, wimpy hair; these products clean gently, style without weighing my hair down, and</li>
      <li>with the spray I can complete styling and it stays all day!</li>
      <li>If you see white pieces of paste on your hair you&#x27;ve used too much!</li>
      <li>I know tons of people that use it and have only positive things to say about the product.</li>
      <li>However, once in your hair, the smell completely went away.  </li>
      <li>This is the number one product for men with short hair because it allows so much versatility in style.</li>
      <li>I blow dry my hair for a curly or straight look.</li>
      <li>You wouldn&#x27;t want to to apply too much because it will leave a big chunk of white residue.</li>
      <li>but this seems to be a little longer lasting and a little more workable.</li>
      <li>smelled a little too much like chemicals.  </li>
      <li>Does exactly what I want it to do to my hair with very little product.  </li>

    <li> My hair stylist use lab in the salon and I love. It smooths my edges without being tacky stiff or flaky. Ultra never had it so I&#x27;m glad I can purchase it on amazon</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.I have used other similar products over the years but this one tops them all.A little goes a long way. It seems to just know how to handle my coarse hair .It will help you smooth  or you can spike,shape, twist,whatever your heart desires. Your style just seems to last longer without all the gooey build-up I had with other products.try it and you will like it too.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this, me being  african-american i have used all types of styling products to lay my hair down and keep it in place without frizzing up or curling back up after a few hours. This stuff keeps it all in place i absolutely love it. I am running low on it right now and i feel like I&#x27;m going to lose my mind if i don&#x27;t get some more soon. But i highly recommend it to anyone with any hair type.</li>
    <li> Product isn&#x27;t authentic.</li>
    <li> Love this product, i am a black female with very kinky hair and this lays my edges down so good. People think i have a perm and i dont. And it last for days</li>
    <li> Love this stuff...especially great for short hair. Lasts forever...a little goes a long way. Very good value. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years. It is the best one I have found that works well with my thinner hair. I used to use Crew Fiber which is good too but this seems to be a little longer lasting and a little more workable. I heard a rumor that they aren&#x27;t going to make it anymore and if so, I am going to be super bummed!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product for my faux hawk.  I&#x27;ve tried many products over the years and most are either too stiff, leave too much residue, aren&#x27;t manageable, etc...  This is my GO TO product when I&#x27;m rockin the faux hawk!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holds really well but still manageable.  Not hard &amp; stiff like many products</li>
    <li> Baby-fine, wimpy hair; these products clean gently, style without weighing my hair down, and with the spray I can complete styling and it stays all day!</li>
    <li> This product works very well for people who have fine fly away hair, it really keeps it in place with body.</li>
    <li> This is the only hair paste that works for me. Tried many others. Sad that it is discontinued.</li>
    <li> This is the only product I have found that will keep my short and fine hair in the spiky style I like.</li>
    <li> Good stuff... but seal was open causing it to arrive slightly harden...perhaps they should check before sending it out...shall try them out again</li>
    <li> This is a hard to find product in stores so I was so pleased to find this available online.  This is the number one product for men with short hair because it allows so much versatility in style.</li>
    <li> Great product! Gives my short hair great body and makes it very easy to blow dry into a great style!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, have tried others and there is no comparison even in the paul mitchell line.</li>
    <li> Different formula from when I used to purchase it in salons.</li>
    <li> Ordered this after reading the reviews.  Just used it for the first time today.  I&#x27;m very very impressed.  If you are looking for spikes - this it the product.  Hair will stand right up and holds very well.  Washes out easily too, which is a huge plus.  You can&#x27;t go wrong!!  I initially did not like the smell of it before I put it on my hair -- smelled a little too much like chemicals.  However, once in your hair, the smell completely went away.  Highly recommend this!!!!!</li>
    <li> Quick shipping, product as advertised. Works great on my short coarse hair to help keep it styled and laying down. Super hold.  Only drawback is it&#x27;s not paraben free.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair adn this is very good when my hair is short. If my hair is on the long side it weighs it down.</li>
    <li> this is a very good product for fine hair that needs a &amp;#34; boost&amp;#34;- once my morning hair style is completed its good for the day..</li>
    <li> This is the only product I know that makes you hair look like you have no product in it. I love it!</li>
    <li> Does exactly what I want it to do to my hair with very little product.  I may be doing something to my hormones too with the parabens in the ingredients.  I highly recommend if you want to be part of the science experiment with me.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t the exact one that u deferred but its working just fine.. Good product to have..be careful not to order the strictly paste it&#x27;s really oily</li>
    <li> Came in quickly and did its job to my hair! Thank you! I can&#x27;t find this product anywhere.</li>
    <li> i ave thin hair so this gives it body and curl when applied while hair is  damp, small amt rubbed  on hands  till clear and  stroked into short hair. can add nore to spike it up</li>
    <li> This product is okay. I know tons of people that use it and have only positive things to say about the product. I am a black woman, no chemical treatments in my hair, and my hair is naturally curly. I would say my hair type is 3a and all this product does is make my hair curl even more once the product mixes with the natural oils in my hair. You wouldn&#x27;t want to to apply too much because it will leave a big chunk of white residue. Now , what I think would work best is if you put it on dryer hair, for example, freshly blown out hair. However, I keep my hair very moisturized ( not greasy at all, but I do enjoy my pre-pos and steam treatments) and I don&#x27;t think that works with this product; too much slip. Those are my thoughts on this.</li>
    <li> I have very thin hair and this is the only product that adds volume but holds it in place.  Can&#x27;t go a day without it!</li>
    <li> I was turned on to this paste at a hair salon over 10 years ago.  I blow dry my hair for a curly or straight look. After drying rub a small amount on your fingertips then run your fingers underneath your hair for fuller body.  I also use it to style my bangs or top and sides of layered pieces.  It is a gummy paste, just-a-dab&#x27;ll-do-ya!  If you see white pieces of paste on your hair you&#x27;ve used too much! Experiment with it when you have nowhere to go so it can be washed out if you don&#x27;t like the initial results. FYI: I tried adding a drop of oil to the paste to loosen its consistency but was not happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and it came quickly too.</li>
    <li> The very best product I have found for short hair. Little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Great flexibility and hold for a man&#x27;s hair! Has a long shelf life and easy to use on any length of hair!</li>
