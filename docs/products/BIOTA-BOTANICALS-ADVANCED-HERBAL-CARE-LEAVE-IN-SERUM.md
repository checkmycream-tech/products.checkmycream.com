      <li>I was just floored of all the great reviews.</li>
      <li>the shampoo is a GREAT Product.</li>
      <li>which is great.</li>
      <li>I started to use a frizz product which always helped with fly away issue.</li>
      <li>so good luck</li>
      <li>I used to use phytocyane products with good results but the price became prohibitive for me.</li>
      <li>Just add an good moisturizing conditioner.</li>
      <li>Though the serum feels good on my scalp, I have noticed no improvement whatsoever.</li>
      <li>so it was great to see guys talking about you about how good you were and the girls talking about how cute you were.</li>
      <li>I am very satisfied with the re-growth of the areas where I suffered thinning before.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried it yet, but I&#x27;m sure I will be happy with it.</li>
      <li>One day, I went to cvs and bought the shampoo, conditioner and the serum and have been very satisfied with it.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s for sure!</li>
      <li>I am absolutely in love with this product!</li>
      <li>However, I continue to use my own conditioner (Nexxus humectress)</li>
      <li>but I would say they are definitely worth it!!!</li>
      <li>Growing up being one of the more popular kids in the neighborhood, all you heard was compliments from guys or girls.</li>
      <li>Love, love, love it!</li>
      <li>more volume and my hair is growing thicker &#x3D;]</li>
      <li>I have finally found something that will save me from becoming bald!!!!  </li>
      <li>loss more hair with this product</li>
      <li>They are VERY concentrated on making their clients happy.</li>
      <li>which in my opinion makes them even better.</li>
      <li>Truthfully, i didn&#x27;t expect it to, but decided id give it a try anyway, .So</li>
      <li>Once my supply runs out, I will not be using this brand any more.</li>
      <li>, I have seen more hair come out.</li>
      <li>It gets better as you use longer.</li>
      <li>I prayed that I was not breaking and pulling more hair out.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>but I did get most of it.</li>
      <li>I use both the Biota Botanicals shampoo and serum and use them both most every day.</li>
      <li>I had to stop using this product because it just worried me that maybe I was damaging it more.</li>
      <li>I loved this product the first week I used it.</li>
      <li>I recommed this product for people who have damaged hair due to overprocessing it works great!!!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
      <li>But it is easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>This product has also made my hair a little darker but it looks great!</li>
      <li>have read in some places that it takes 6-8 months to see significant hair growth.</li>
      <li>My biggest issue is that it&#x27;s making my hair really dry, frizzy and fly aways everywhere.</li>
      <li>but don&#x27;t clean hair with Biota Shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
      <li>yeah right!</li>
      <li>I feel that my scalp doesn&#x27;t show as much anymore (which is a huge improvement!).</li>
      <li>(Be careful what you wish for, LOL)  </li>
      <li>My hair appears to be in much better condition and it has a much fuller appearance (you can&#x27;t see my scalp now) than every before.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ll know if the claims it makes is true.</li>
      <li>Made it full</li>
      <li>But it was still full.</li>
      <li>but my hair was no longer as full.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to really see if this works or not.  </li>
      <li>I am fifty and have suffered with fine thinning hair most of my adult life.</li>
      <li>Gave me a mild headache when I started using it.</li>
      <li>I have tried everything for my thinning hair, without the success I desired.  </li>
      <li>I began to see condition results right away and thickening results after 3-4 weeks.</li>
      <li>That speaks volumes right there.</li>
      <li>and I can honestly say that this is the first product that actually had visible results.</li>
      <li>I used both the serun and shampoo for 6 months and was nothing but amazed at how my top, crown, and top back head-hair problem areas have mostly filled back in, and I&#x27;m in my 50s.</li>
      <li>I loved the fullness, but pulling the tangles and the brittleness was just not worth it.</li>
      <li>it seems to really work!</li>
      <li>I was glad I found this on-line as I could not find it locally.  </li>
      <li>Also you may have to use a clarifying shampoo for the first shampoo before using the biota shampoo once in awhile.</li>
      <li>After showering, I come my hair back and dab the serum in between parts throughout the top of my hair and comb through.</li>
      <li>Thanks Biota Botanicals!</li>
      <li>used the shampoo first and my hair became dry&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
      <li>BEAUTIFULLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! not frizz, not dull, and soft, soft! So happy with it, my scalp is no longer itching, thats a good thing.</li>
      <li>After a few more weeks of use my concerns about this issue increased as my hair began to feel brittle, look dull and fly away.</li>
      <li>It really didn&#x27;t change anything, I don&#x27;t see a change.  </li>
      <li>Much lower than national chain drugstores</li>
      <li>I was very scared, I thought my hair would never recover.  </li>
      <li>I would have to really give it a year to see progress.....</li>
      <li>cost so much money.</li>
      <li>I really want this to work.....</li>
      <li>I still have lots of bald areas but not as much as before using this product.</li>
      <li>Very stubborn.</li>
      <li>I am not going to say I see much hair growth</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really rate it yet.  </li>
      <li>When rubbing in Shampoo and conditioner, gently massage for 60-90 secs.</li>
      <li>My suggestion, based solely on my own experiences, its yet another waste of money.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and doesn&#x27;t dry out scalp.</li>
      <li>Or it could be my new eating habits, cant really judge.</li>
      <li>Okay have been using Biota shampoo and Serum for a little over 2 weeks now.</li>
      <li>works well with the shampoo especially if you like to use products in the same line - a little tingle at first - but its a good product</li>
      <li>When the product has dried on your hair, your hair does look like it is thicker and has more volume.</li>
      <li>If anything, it made my hair greasier than normal, and gave the appearance that it was thinning even faster.</li>
      <li>I have not seen any new hair growth.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say that I have miraculous new growth</li>
      <li>I do see new growth in the thining areas.</li>
      <li>Very natural serum</li>
      <li>OK, that&#x27;s great, but I already have styling products that achieve the same result, and I don&#x27;t need to spend an HOUR applying them, because of stupid packaging</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> works well with the shampoo especially if you like to use products in the same line - a little tingle at first - but its a good product</li>
    <li> I used to use phytocyane products with good results but the price became prohibitive for me. I came across the B&#x27;iota products on sale at my local pharmacy and figured I would give it a try. I saw immediate results with the shampoo as far as shedding. while I still lose some hair, it has been significantly less. I read a lot of people saying that it makes their hair dry or tangled, while this is true all you need to do is use a little conditioner or detangler after shampooing. I use half a bottle a day of the serum. I have so far used only half the box (6 bottles, just under 2 weeks) and definitely see a difference in my hair, which I hadn&#x27;t expected. I can&#x27;t say that I have miraculous new growth but my hair looks and feels healthier and thicker, and I feel that my scalp doesn&#x27;t show as much anymore (which is a huge improvement!). As far as complaints about smell, product texture, difficult application process and so on....these are all extremely minor things. As a woman who&#x27;s hair has been thinning at an alarming rate for several years I was willing to deal with just about anything to reverse it and have found that these products are simple and easy to use with no adverse side effects so far, and they are natural- which in my opinion makes them even better. I would definitely recommend trying these to others</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference yet. Maybe it&#x27;s too soon to know. However, whatever the results should be in another month there should be a difference and I&#x27;ll know if the claims it makes is true.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely in love with this product! Very natural serum i recommend everyone to try this !! Using the Biota shampoo and this together has definitely made a difference in my hair. more volume and my hair is growing thicker &#x3D;] i recommend using the serum and shampoo together! works great!</li>
    <li> My scalp tingles after using it, was told by a hair care pro that it&#x27;s a sign that it is working.</li>
    <li> My thinning hair problem has gotten worse through the years.&lt;br /&gt;My friend suggested I try Biota Serum after it was recommended to her&lt;br /&gt;during her cancer recovery major hair loss.  My hair stopped falling out&lt;br /&gt;almost immediately and I began getting return growth.  I love this product.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working. My crown is starting to grow new hair.</li>
    <li> I bought all 3 products; shampoo, conditioner and serum.  Was not aware that especially flagged on the serum that it could possibly change hair color.  I haven&#x27;t used it yet because of that but if it doesn&#x27;t change my color I will be happy.  I did not want to try until after easter.</li>
    <li> i see an improvement in my hair texture,yes  i have recommended to a few of my friends.and i will also continue to use it  like it alot.ive tryed  other products this one works the best along w/the shampoo as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this product for 8 months. The result is great! You realize the difference in 2-3 months. It gets better as you use longer. Just follow the instructions.</li>
    <li> A lot less hair on the floor and in the shower. I do see a difference and will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for over a month and have not seen any results. I am still hoping that their claims are legitimate.</li>
    <li> To the one who said it left her hair dry.. Yes your hair after dried will feel drier. Just add an good moisturizing conditioner. Your hair is not being harmed. And I also use an keratin enriched heat protection spray. Also you may have to use a clarifying shampoo for the first shampoo before using the biota shampoo once in awhile.</li>
    <li> I bought this a couple of month&#x27;s ago. It says it takes 6 months to work. I think I see thicker hair already! It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
    <li> I am typing on my girlfriends amazon account. My name is Angelo, I am from Howard Beach, Ny. Growing up being one of the more popular kids in the neighborhood, all you heard was compliments from guys or girls. I was a basketball player so it was great to see guys talking about you about how good you were and the girls talking about how cute you were. Now I am 23 years old and I have suffered some thinning at the corner of my hairline for about 3-4 years. This past year while I was going through a lot of stuff with my parents being divorced and moving out of the comfort of my house, my family, I have seen more hair come out. It kills my confidence, ego and everything else. My gf has been telling me try anything, something. Don&#x27;t just let your hair go without giving it a shot. One day, I went to cvs and bought the shampoo, conditioner and the serum and have been very satisfied with it. I have used it for 1 month. I am not going to say I see much hair growth but I can tell you, I have see little to no shedding of my hair which can only mean good things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the process that I have been using :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Serum (Leave on for 6-8 hr or over the course of a day is fine)&lt;br /&gt;2. Regular shower but don&#x27;t clean hair with Biota Shampoo &amp; conditioner. Use cold/warm water and wash out. Towel dry hair and use Biota Serum again.&lt;br /&gt;3. Use Shampoo and conditioner the day after washing your hair with water so every other day after the Serum. When rubbing in Shampoo and conditioner, gently massage for 60-90 secs. After your done, refer to (Step 1).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read in some places that it takes 6-8 months to see significant hair growth. I am 100% committed to it and will update you guys soon.</li>
    <li> I heard about Biota Botanicals on my local radio news station. Great stuff! I am an African American woman who had been having a long standing problem (years) with my hair falling out and getting incredibly thin, so I figured what did I have to loose?  After years of expensive Dermatology visits and prescription shampoos and topical creams and ointments, and thinking that maybe it was just heredity, I found that after only 3 days of using Biota Botanicals products, my hair literally stopped shedding!!!!! I could actually count the hairs that fell out! Less than 10!!!!!! I was ecstatically impressed!!!!! I have finally found something that will save me from becoming bald!!!!  Thanks Biota Botanicals!</li>
    <li> Used after every shampoo for several months (exclusively used Biota shampoo) and there was NO detectable change whatsoever.  This was a let down.</li>
    <li> Serum does not work, I use in conjunction with shampoo and conditioner for thinning hair and it does not work at all.  My hair is still shedding and thin.  Used about 3wks now.</li>
    <li> Tried taking hair related vitamins with limited success, but this topical definitely worked.  Even my hairdresser asked what I did differently!</li>
    <li> I loved this product the first week I used it. Made it full and I no longer looked like I was loosing my hair. I was initially concerned about how difficult it was to comb my hair out, it was a tangled mess after washing. I prayed that I was not breaking and pulling more hair out. I searched for a conditioner to help with the comb out. But this product did not have one. After a few more weeks of use my concerns about this issue increased as my hair began to feel brittle, look dull and fly away. But it was still full. I started to use a frizz product which always helped with fly away issue. It helped with that but my hair was no longer as full.  I had to stop using this product because it just worried me that maybe I was damaging it more. I loved the fullness, but pulling the tangles and the brittleness was just not worth it. Maybe if you make a conditioner to go along with the shampoo I would come back to using this product.</li>
    <li> Okay have been using Biota shampoo and Serum for a little over 2 weeks now. My biggest issue is that it&#x27;s making my hair really dry, frizzy and fly aways everywhere. My hair is falling out less which is great. Another thing I&#x27;d like t mention is that after washing my hair it makes it extremely difficult to comb my hair out with it being all tangled. I hope the company is working on making some type of conditioner. I will keep using the products until I run out.</li>
    <li> It dried my hair out.  It really didn&#x27;t change anything, I don&#x27;t see a change.  And I can&#x27;t get my money back</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t imagine losing my hair or balding in the crown of my scalp.  When those signs started appearing, I looked for a solution to intercept this process common as you age. I&#x27;ve been natural for 18 years and was not using chemicals to damage my hair.  However, I began to see aggressive thinning and  DHT appearing at my crown.  I heard the radio advertisement of B&#x27;IOTA  Botanicals for thinning &amp; damaged hair.  I have been using it for 10 months and have seen my hair grow faster and thicker! I am very satisfied with the re-growth of the areas where I suffered thinning before.  I also stimulate my scalp with a stern massage to allow the blood flow to promote hair growth as well.  If drying or tangling does occur, I counter with detangler and leave-in conditioners with natural oils to soften my hair.  I will continue to use it due to the results I&#x27;ve seen in the past 10 months.</li>
    <li> I have been trying everything to get my hair back to good condition, I am 38 and have over processed my hair in the last 2 yr which caused my hair to thin out and start breaking. I was very scared, I thought my hair would never recover.  I stated using this product 1 week ago I have used it everyday and have washed my hair every other day. I have not used the BIOTA shampoo but after seeing the results of the serum I think I will go buy it.  My dry lifeless hair is gone!!  The split ends are gone! My hair is fuller and shininer than ever.  I cant wait to see the result in a month of use since this is barely a week.  I recommed this product for people who have damaged hair due to overprocessing it works great!!!!</li>
    <li> Works great with the conditioner and shampoo...!</li>
    <li> I have tried everything for my thinning hair, without the success I desired.  One day, on my way to work, this product was advertised on the radio station I was listening to.  That same evening, I stopped at the CVS and purchased the serum, and What La La!!! after three days of use, my thinning hair was so thick!  I use the product once per day instead of twice per day! (Be careful what you wish for, LOL)  I did not use the shampoo as the product instructed. My hair is African American.  This product really worked for me, and hope it does the same for you too!!!  Love, love, love it!</li>
    <li> Did not see any difference.</li>
    <li> Great price!  Much lower than national chain drugstores</li>
    <li> No results. It&#x27;s watery and runs all over your face and head. Kinda smells and stains your skin yellow. If I could, I would return it.</li>
    <li> Gave me a mild headache when I started using it. Kept using it for a week and headache persisted. Stopped using it and headache went away. Waited 2 weeks to try again. Headache returned. Gave up after 10 days.</li>
    <li> I was glad I found this on-line as I could not find it locally.  I haven&#x27;t tried it yet, but I&#x27;m sure I will be happy with it.</li>
    <li> This really is not working for my hair....I would have to really give it a year to see progress.....regardless what product i use im still going to have hair loss because of my age....There no such thing as preventing hair loss ....hairloss comes with time.  Our Body every day goes through changes just like our hair and also as long as we r exposed to the sun on a daily basic we r damaging our hair and skin....</li>
    <li> Minus 1 star because I did not get all of my hair back in 6 month garrantee, but I did get most of it. I used both the serun and shampoo for 6 months and was nothing but amazed at how my top, crown, and top back head-hair problem areas have mostly filled back in, and I&#x27;m in my 50s. I&#x27;ve definitly been inspired to use these products for another 6 months, then continue using the shampoo.</li>
    <li> loss more hair with this product</li>
    <li> I do see new growth in the thining areas. It does take a while.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and doesn&#x27;t dry out scalp.</li>
    <li> Was very unhappy with product. Did not do what it claims at least not for me. Still have thin hair.</li>
    <li> I use both the Biota Botanicals shampoo and serum and use them both most every day. I use half of a little bottle of serum per day. After showering, I come my hair back and dab the serum in between parts throughout the top of my hair and comb through. I am fifty and have suffered with fine thinning hair most of my adult life. I have tried numerous thickening and growing products over the years and I can honestly say that this is the first product that actually had visible results. My hair appears to be in much better condition and it has a much fuller appearance (you can&#x27;t see my scalp now) than every before. I began to see condition results right away and thickening results after 3-4 weeks. My hair has also begun to grow faster than ever - I am not sure if the Biota has anything to do with this or if it&#x27;s just vitamins or a growth spurt! Biota cost a little more than basic shampoo and the serum is about $30 per month (look for sales on the product) but I would say they are definitely worth it!!!</li>
    <li> I gave Biota 2 stars because frankly, it doesn&#x27;t live up to its claims, at least for me. Truthfully, i didn&#x27;t expect it to, but decided id give it a try anyway, .So why 2 stars? While my hair sadly remains just as before, i am wondering if perhaps its not falling out quite so dramatically. Or it could be my new eating habits, cant really judge. My suggestion, based solely on my own experiences, its yet another waste of money. Also i find it very difficult to get the liquid out of the little bottle. I shake it ,i do all sorts of gymnastics. Very stubborn. Been using it faithfully for about a month now, daily...still waiting for the miracle!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really rate it yet.  Nothing has happened since I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also been using the shampoo.  I thing I&#x27;ve used it for about 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> I have been using Biota Serum for a few months.  It is easy to use, a little goes a long way,on&lt;br /&gt;just your scalp. Push in the bottom of the little bottle and it dispenses the drops on your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;It will take a few more months to see if there is any difference .... It smells great and is not greasy !</li>
    <li> I had thick, lightly wavy Caucasian hair that is graying. Over the past few years my hair has become thin, and stops growing after only a few inches (I used to be able to grow thick, luscious hair that I kept trimmed to waist length). I&#x27;ve been using Biota shampoo and serum to stop by hair loss and started using the conditioner about 3 months ago when it came out because I thought using the entire line would help. There has been no change in my hair growth at all (I&#x27;ve been using Biota for at least 9 months now). Though the serum feels good on my scalp, I have noticed no improvement whatsoever. Also, Biota aggravates my psoriasis. Once my supply runs out, I will not be using this brand any more. Between the shampoo, conditioner, and serum, I like the serum the best.</li>
    <li> Like the fragrance.  I admit it is hard for me to follow the regimen required to see the results promised.</li>
    <li> it seems to really work! It is slow but it was really works. I thought it was going to be a messy process, but it wasn&#x27;t messy at all.</li>
    <li> i have been using it sparingly becuse i color my hair.....I am hoping that sooner I will see progressive results</li>
    <li> Made my hair start to fall out faster within days of using it</li>
    <li> I had used the Biota shampoo and conditioner for about a month prior to purchasing this item. If anything, it made my hair greasier than normal, and gave the appearance that it was thinning even faster. Definitely not going to continue this product!</li>
    <li> since a child, at the age of 3 have suffered bouts with alopecia areta,still suffer from alopecia every couple of years. Last June 2012 I started with the Wen...a great product, BUT! cost so much money. just a gallon of Wen I paid $177.00 plus shipping and taxes. Just about a month ago my scalp started to itch really bad.....which scared me to death, Why!?????? BEACUSE WHEN I start another bout with alopecia areta my scalp itches so bad. I started researching Biota! I was just floored of all the great reviews. have wash my hair 3 times with it, I LOVE IT!!!!! My hair is long, so I take drops at a time and rub it in to my scalp, then wet my entire head and rub the rest in. like one customer said a little goes a long way. yes my hair feels a little harsh, a little stiff after the wash, but what i did is that I applied very little conditioner of Dove, Very little, My hair looks!!!!! Shines!!!!!! BEAUTIFULLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! not frizz, not dull, and soft, soft! So happy with it, my scalp is no longer itching, thats a good thing. will continue to use the shampoo, will try the serum when I have enough money. Hope this review will help someone else that has suffered with alopecia off and on, the way I have. Came back to edit, So sorry I should have wrote on the product of Biota Shampoo,,,I have not tried the serum yet, but I will and plan too. the shampoo is a GREAT Product.</li>
    <li> I tried Biota on a recommendation by my hairdresser.&lt;br /&gt;I used the shampoo first and my hair became dry&lt;br /&gt;and frizzy.  It looked like Brillo.  No shine at all.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is thin and slightly curly and is chin length.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t do a thing with it after washing.  They say&lt;br /&gt;not to use hair products or blow drying......really??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using my regular shampoo - Fructis Fall Fight&lt;br /&gt;and tons of conditioner and my hair is back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;I also bought the viles of Biota and I just started using&lt;br /&gt;them at night and have not noticed any changes yet.&lt;br /&gt;I also use the shampoo again only once every three&lt;br /&gt;times I wash my hair.  I really want this to work.....so&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep trying.</li>
    <li> Tried it. Didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to really see if this works or not.  But it is easy to apply.  Time will tell.</li>
    <li> I have been using the serum about two weeks and the shampoo a week. So far my hair is healthier and shiny but I have yet to see a change in thickness. However, I continue to use my own conditioner (Nexxus humectress) since Biota doesn&#x27;t make one. This product has also made my hair a little darker but it looks great!</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me.  I had to return it.</li>
    <li> I see some minimal hair growth but there is hair growth. I still have lots of bald areas but not as much as before using this product. I&#x27;ve only used it for one month but I plan to continue using it and nothing else. I&#x27;ve tried many products in the past and nothing has worked as well as Biota.</li>
    <li> I have been using the serum for about 1 month and I already see a difference.  My hair looks fuller, and seems to have a different texture.  I will definitely continue using it.</li>
    <li> Did not work - impossible to spot treat your scalp because it is as thin as water, so putting in your hand and then trying to rub into your scalp is impossible.  The little opening at the tip makes you want to shake it onto your thin spots, but that doesn&#x27;t work too well either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money.  Find out what is making your hair fall out - in my case it is a pepcid famodatine side effect and a zinc deficiency.</li>
    <li> I tried to find the Biota Botanicals website so that I could reach out to their customer service directly, but even Google could not locate it.  That speaks volumes right there. I can see from the comments here, that someone from Biota reads these reviews, so Biota, if you&#x27;re listening:  you are losing me as a customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging of the Biota Serum is ridiculous.  The tiny bottles, with their even tinier openings, are nearly impossible to use.  Your directions suggest using 1/2 bottle per day.  It takes me an HOUR to get a half bottle of product on my head, because of your poor packaging design.  I tried to make the opening larger, but that is impossible with the stiff plastic bottle design.  It would take a hammer, and then I would lose the serum contained in the bottle,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why does your product need to be in these tiny containers, anyway?  Why wouldn&#x27;t you just put the 12- ten ml. bottles of serum contained in one box of your product, into one 120 ml. bottle, with an eyedropper applicator that premeasures a 5 ml.application? I am not your only customer who does not have time for this.  Please don&#x27;t tell me that the current packaging, has to do with the degradation of your product - your product has no refrigeration requirement after opening, and no expiration date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who have read this far and are not part of the Biota public relations or marketing department, I have been TRYING to use this product for 2 months (my frustration with the applicator and lack of time to devote to the application, are a deterrent to using it at all).  I have not seen any new hair growth.  The product is applied to the scalp, then massaged in to the scalp by hand.  Of course this process makes your hair messy, so then you need to comb/brush it, after applying the product. When the product has dried on your hair, your hair does look like it is thicker and has more volume. OK, that&#x27;s great, but I already have styling products that achieve the same result, and I don&#x27;t need to spend an HOUR applying them, because of stupid packaging design!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money.  Save your time.  And be wary of any company, whose only Web presence (I went through 10 pages on Google looking for their website), is only from vendors, who are all trying to sell their product!</li>
    <li> I got the worst headache after a couple of uses and the headache continued until I stopped using this product.</li>
    <li> Does not meet even the most limited expectations, hair is dry, dull and the directions say u not suppose to use styling products yeah right! The product claims to make your hair shine, fuller well folks not from what i see. Oh yeah for all of us who like to keep the gray at bay keep in mind they dont recommend using hair dyes so good luck w that, took suggestion bout use henna didnt make a dent .  I c that a rep from the product likes to comment on the review so to them i say what you got say bout that.  Two weeks in hair STILL THIN&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One month update&lt;br /&gt;my opinion of this product has not changed and neither has my thinning hair.  Actually stopped using the shampoo which helped with the drying, dullness problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final update 6 weeks:  have now stopped using this product altogether, it did nothing it promised and actually accentuated the thinning of my hair and then made it dull and difficult to style.  Will not continue to waste my time or money on this product, next time someone promises such results they are gonna have to back that up with a money back guarantee.</li>
    <li> They are VERY concentrated on making their clients happy. They will have my business in the future. That&#x27;s for sure!</li>
    <li> It takes over 1/2 hour to dab the serum onto the scalp and rub it in.  Too long.</li>
    <li> Still waiting for something different to happen.  Haven&#x27;t seen thick hair or more growth.  I&#x27;m trying to be patient.  I use the shampoo, conditioner and the Biota Botanicals Bioxsine Series Serum faithfully but patiently waiting for results.</li>
