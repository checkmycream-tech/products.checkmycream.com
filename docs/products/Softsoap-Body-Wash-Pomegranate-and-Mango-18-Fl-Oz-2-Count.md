      <li>Love the scent.</li>
      <li>and I know I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
      <li>Another reviewer noted that adding water to this makes it dispense more easily from its container, and I too have found this to be the case.</li>
      <li>love this and its the only thing i am not allergic to lol</li>
      <li>Not too strong.</li>
      <li>Great price for this double bottle set.  </li>

      <li>The smell is refreshing and never gets old.</li>
      <li>I was absolutely waiting more from soft soap.</li>
      <li>It is not as lush and lotion-like as others and its actual abilities as a moisturizing body wash are suspect, but it&#x27;s a dynamite product with a delicious fragrance that doesn&#x27;t bother my allergies and doesn&#x27;t leave a film on my skin (which is a huge plus, as our water is VERY hard and finding products that don&#x27;t form precipitates is a never ending quest).</li>
      <li>Here&#x27;s one I go out of my way for, ever since I first bought it in a store several years ago.</li>
      <li>A small dab goes a long way, but I&#x27;m the kind who&#x27;s gotta put a little more on the scrub.</li>
      <li>It lathers well, rinses clean and leaves my skin soft, despite the hard water I have to deal with.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also found that thinning it down a little helps it to build a more bubbly lather.</li>
      <li>When so many other body washes seem to be diluting their mixtures lately, these Soft-soap body washes seem to be keeping to their formula.</li>

    <li> This is thick i mean thick i had to add water to even ot out so OK t last lomger....thats what a bidy wash suppose to be like....smell os reslly nice to</li>
    <li> I was absolutely waiting more from soft soap. I have used this brand in the foam hand soap and they smell amazing and the smells lasts forever. But i can not say the same about this body wash. I regret about buying a pack of two. The smells is not stong.</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s one I go out of my way for, ever since I first bought it in a store several years ago. It is not as lush and lotion-like as others and its actual abilities as a moisturizing body wash are suspect, but it&#x27;s a dynamite product with a delicious fragrance that doesn&#x27;t bother my allergies and doesn&#x27;t leave a film on my skin (which is a huge plus, as our water is VERY hard and finding products that don&#x27;t form precipitates is a never ending quest). Another reviewer noted that adding water to this makes it dispense more easily from its container, and I too have found this to be the case. I&#x27;ve also found that thinning it down a little helps it to build a more bubbly lather. But you can judge that for yourselves when you use this.</li>
    <li> Other Softsoap types smell great, but this particular type smells terrible. I suggest trying another fragrance. Not recommended at all.</li>
    <li> Favorite scent. But wish there were no plastic beads in it</li>
    <li> Because I rent, I have to live with the fact that the water is hard here since my landlord won&#x27;t allow us to put in a water softener. Because of this, a lot of body washes don&#x27;t work, but Softsoap does. Out of all the scents, this is my favorite. It lathers well, rinses clean and leaves my skin soft, despite the hard water I have to deal with.</li>
    <li> Love the scent! Not too strong.</li>
    <li> love the scent and love the lathering, does ok job and cleaning and making you feel clean, does excellent job at scent, I love pomegranate scents and this one is great</li>
    <li> This is SOOOO good...If you ever wished you could smell heaven...this is it.</li>
    <li> love this and its the only thing i am not allergic to lol</li>
    <li> My favorite body soap!! It smells so good!! Love it!!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t even smell like apple. Very disappointed. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend. Try another scent. This smells like nothing.:(</li>
    <li> When so many other body washes seem to be diluting their mixtures lately, these Soft-soap body washes seem to be keeping to their formula. Does a great job foaming and cleaning, and smells great.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this product.  Lathers and cleans well, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  Great price for this double bottle set.  Lasts a long time.  I always like Softsoap products, but this is my favorite.</li>
    <li> This is just great and smells wonderful</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different &#x27;flavors&#x27; of Softsoap Body Wash, and this one is the one I keep coming back to.  Best combination of cleansing and fragrance.</li>
    <li> I have used this body wash for years. Love the scent.</li>
    <li> perfrume is good and quality is good</li>
    <li> Love this body wash! It smells great and I can smell it on my skin for hours, as well as the entire upstairs after I shower.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of this stuff. A small dab goes a long way, but I&#x27;m the kind who&#x27;s gotta put a little more on the scrub. The smell is refreshing and never gets old. You know how some scents can wear on you and you just want to smell something else? Well, this isn&#x27;t one of them. I&#x27;ve got a full bottle waiting for when I&#x27;m done with the one I&#x27;m on and I know I&#x27;ll be buying more. Yeah, it&#x27;s that kinda good.</li>
    <li> Love the scent and great discounted price than purchasing in the stores.</li>
    <li> Great product and shipped quickly</li>
    <li> Smells so good you want to drink it... but you probably shouldn&#x27;t.</li>
