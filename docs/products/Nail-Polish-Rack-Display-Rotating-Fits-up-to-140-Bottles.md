      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Otherwise, a great product at a reasonable price and great service.</li>
      <li>Because I get my nails done every two weeks I decided a while ago to buy my own polish, well as time went on</li>
      <li>She really liked that.  </li>
      <li>shelves are good for much more than nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
      <li>this is one sturdy, nicely made piece.  </li>
      <li>Came in perfect condition and extremely fast.</li>
      <li>The nicest polish rack of any kind that I have ever seen.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice cause</li>
      <li>It was so worth it!!!</li>
      <li>Great buy worth the price very satisfied.</li>
      <li>Make sure you have somewhere you can place it, so that it&#x27;s able to be rotated when wanting to browse all the polishes!</li>
      <li>I chose this one over the newer version that holds 200-something bottles because i felt this one looked sturdier and had a more &amp;#34;sophisticated&amp;#34; look to it.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>It turned out I have more polishes than space and</li>
      <li>I love the spinning feature.  </li>
      <li>love them, they hold a ton of polish</li>
      <li>Might have to force myself to buy more polish.  </li>
      <li>top tear holds 44 10ml bottles.</li>
      <li>I had many many bottles of polish</li>
      <li>I love that it rotates so you can see all your polish.</li>
      <li>The top opens up and you can store stuff on the inside as well.</li>
      <li>I am so pleased</li>
      <li>It is ok</li>
      <li>In fact it is better for 30ml than 10ml bottles.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This was my favorite nail polish rack.  </li>
      <li>and she said it was the best birthday present ever!</li>
      <li>I absolutely love having all of my polishes out and easily accessible!</li>
      <li>all I am happy at the moment.&lt;br /&gt;They are getting four stars because I think the price was too high.</li>
      <li>Most regular sized nail polishes (i.e. OPI, Sally Hansen, Maybelline, Revlon, Loreal) will fit perfectly however</li>
      <li>package came pretty quick(4 or 5 days), and came in good condition.  </li>
      <li>I was able to fit 142 polishes (most are China Glaze, Gelish, and OPI)</li>
      <li>For those I just put them on the top rack and it worked out fine.</li>
      <li>It arrived in great condition in a sturdy box with good protection due to cardboard placers and bubble wrap.  </li>
      <li>Sephora by OPI is too tall but they fit on the top shelf.  </li>
      <li>Not only looks great but revolves very smoothly.</li>
      <li>I recently bought this for my girlfriends birthday, and all i can say was that she absolutely loved it!  </li>
      <li>The customer service was wonderful - they were very quick to respond and extremely helpful.</li>
      <li>It spins really easy and holds A LOT of nail polish bottles.  </li>
      <li>It is well made and spins easily.</li>
      <li>This item ships very quickly and is packaged well.</li>
      <li>It fit my sizable collection neatly and was easy to swivel it around to see what I had.  </li>
      <li>but these fit just fine.  </li>
      <li>I ordered this to hold my huge collection of Sephora OPI nailpolish.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
      <li>Mine arrived damaged,a huge hole in it and a crack on the side.</li>
      <li>Very well made, sturdy and nice looking once filled..</li>
      <li>We picked up a couple a few days ago and received it in excellent condition.</li>
      <li>easily fit.  </li>
      <li>If you have all Orly/OPI-sized nail polish bottles, you can fit</li>
      <li>/&gt;Honestly very satisfied with this and might end up buying another one in the future (she already almost filled it up!)</li>
      <li>The shipping was super fast which I liked a lot</li>
      <li>WELL worth the $70!</li>
      <li>Fits all my nail polishes (most sizes) and it looks really neat.</li>
      <li>I know the description does not state that, but the customer photos and reviews are very misleading as they do indicate the top will come off for storage.</li>
      <li>I guess it depends on the shape and size of the bottles.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a good purchase, I&#x27;ve already purchased a 2nd one.</li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this awesome piece, and i have been let down to the max.</li>
      <li>There was no sign with the nail polish holder, and the top does not come off to be able to use the middle as storage.</li>
      <li>looks super legit, something you would find at a salon.</li>
      <li>The shipping was uber quick and there was no assembly required.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product if you have a lot of nail polish and want to be able to see your collection.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love my new rack. Prompt service! Thumbs up!</li>
    <li> if only it was taller!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves her nail polish rack! It arrived well packaged and it is absolutely perfect for her collection of polishes. Great product!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this! A little expensive, but well worth the price! I love that it rotates so you can see all your polish. More than enough space for my polish. LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this! I was afraid it wouldn&#x27;t fit the taller ones (Nicole OPI, orly, wtd) but they fit Perfectly!! Will definitely need and will be purchasing another one (because I&#x27;m a nail polish hoarder ;)!!) great product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ps the storage space in the middle is genius and even fits my glazer! Box and all!!</li>
    <li> The shipping was super fast which I liked a lot but it came a little damaged. On one side a piece of it was cracked off and I had to super glue that piece back on which worked for now. And another thing is that the nail polish rack in the picture is not the same nail polish rack that I received. The one that they sent me was this one [[ASIN:B0052G15UG Nail Polish Table Rack Display (Hold Up To 144 Bottles) Spinable]] which I was a little disappointed about because I really liked the one in the picture more. And I had also seen it on a video on YouTube which made me decide to buy it in the first place. And to the people who also bought the nail polish rack too, I would really like to know if you actually received the nail polish rack in the picture or got a different one like me?</li>
    <li> I am a nail polish freak!  I was using a caboodle to store my polish but I ran out of room so I got a big tool box to store my polish but then I could not see all the colors to choose which one I wanted to use.  But this display rack fits all 90 of my OPI polishes and I can see each and every one clearly.  There is also a center compartment where I keep my remover, cotton balls, etc.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This item ships very quickly and is packaged well. The top part that covers the rack on the 1st one I received was broken, but it doesn&#x27;t matter to me because I don&#x27;t need to use it anyway (I&#x27;m using this at home, not in a salon).&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t counted so I can&#x27;t vouch for it holding 140 bottles, but it certainly holds a lot - I guess it depends on the shape and size of the bottles.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a good purchase, I&#x27;ve already purchased a 2nd one.</li>
    <li> This thing is AWESOME! The top comes off to reveal storage in the center, so you&#x27;re not wasting empty space. It came packaged extremely well and quick. Also, you can&#x27;t beat the price for the amount of storage. My only issue is that I need to stop buying nail polish because I need another one of these. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This was on her wish list and she said it was the best birthday present ever! Exactly like the picture!~</li>
    <li> Great nail rack.  The rack is sturdy and hold a ton of nail polishes from OPI, Orly, Finger Paints.  Sephora brand nail polish only fits on top rack, too tall for other shelves.  The spinning feature is very smooth when it is loaded, slightly wobbly when no loaded.  Very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I recently bought this for my girlfriends birthday, and all i can say was that she absolutely loved it!  I chose this one over the newer version that holds 200-something bottles because i felt this one looked sturdier and had a more &amp;#34;sophisticated&amp;#34; look to it.  I also read the other one kindof wobbled when it rotated, so I chose this one instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package came pretty quick(4 or 5 days), and came in good condition.  The rack itself rotates pretty smoothly, and is very lightweight.  I decided to add a few customizations of my own to further enhance this rack though.  Since the rack is see through, i got some poster boards i cut to size and glued on some paper designs(my girl likes mustaches) onto the poster boards to make as inserts.  I also made them reversible with the other sides being zebra print.  She really liked that.  But that&#x27;s just a suggestion, the rack makes an awesome gift by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly very satisfied with this and might end up buying another one in the future (she already almost filled it up!)</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Came in perfect condition and extremely fast. Can finally see all my nail polish colors without pulling them out of the plastic container. This unit has so much room that I actually have shelves empty.  Might have to force myself to buy more polish.  People commented on the interior storage area, but an having trouble figuring out how to open it up.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love having all of my polishes out and easily accessible! I used to keep them in a bucket and couldn&#x27;t even see what I had.  This display is perfect.  The top opens up and you can store stuff on the inside as well.</li>
    <li> Works very well, girlfriend seems to like it as a gift. It holds all her bottles of nail polish although she removed the black thing at the top that says nail polish station.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item on August 30th with a response that it would be delivered between September 6th to 11th. When it didn&#x27;t arrive by the 13th I called and spoke with many different people to find out that my order was lost in transit. Then i was told it would be arriving to me within 5 business days. 5 Business days later i still hadn&#x27;t received it, i called again and was told they were going to mail it out that day, and i would receive it in 5 days. When i FINALLY got it, it was damaged, chipped on the top, a whole shelf broken off, and it doesn&#x27;t fit the same description as it says online. There was no sign with the nail polish holder, and the top does not come off to be able to use the middle as storage. So when i finally hear something back from someone, i&#x27;m going to have to send it back, wait for it again, and hope it doesn&#x27;t come out damaged, and that it&#x27;s the right product. I had high hopes for this awesome piece, and i have been let down to the max. The only reason why i gave it 3 stars is because i really like the idea of having it, and the customer service is nice. Other than that i wouldn&#x27;t give them one star.</li>
    <li> This acrylic rotating rack is 12 inches each side and 19-20 inches high. Each side has 5 rows but the shelves are longer on two sides. On the longer side, each row fits about 9 OPI bottles. The shelves are wider enough to hold bigger bottles like Nicole by OPI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acrylic is sturdy, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about my nail polish bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package arrived in time and it was packed well. There is no assembly required.</li>
    <li> This rack is awesome. It does take up a third of my dresser but I can see all my polishes beautifully and it has given me an opportunity to use colors that I had forgotten about. I was able to fit 142 polishes (most are China Glaze, Gelish, and OPI) and I still have room for about ten more China Glaze bottles. I do wish that the large opening in the middle could be utilized with some built in cubbies rather then having the sign, so I may try and create this myself.</li>
    <li> The package came very secure and with not one chip or crack! I am so pleased and I love it!</li>
    <li> My new guilty pleasure has been doing my own nails and I&#x27;ve slowly builty up a nail polish collection to satify my new hobby.  Most regular sized nail polishes (i.e. OPI, Sally Hansen, Maybelline, Revlon, Loreal) will fit perfectly however the nail polishes that I bought from Sephora are a little too tall for this holder. For those I just put them on the top rack and it worked out fine. This rack helps make me feel like i&#x27;m in a nail salon even though I&#x27;m not.</li>
    <li> It came in perfect and quickly.  The only minor issue is the small sign on top reads &amp;#34;nails polish center&amp;#34; which grammatical sounds odd.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS RACK!!!!  It is totally awesome.  It spins really easy and holds A LOT of nail polish bottles.  So far, I have only found one bottle that doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
    <li> Because I get my nails done every two weeks I decided a while ago to buy my own polish, well as time went on I had many many bottles of polish so I decided to order this polish display stand because it said it can hold up to 144 bottles. I am very pleased with this stand it holds all my polish and I don&#x27;t have bottles everywhere, only thing is I didn&#x27;t know I had enough bottles to fill the whole stand. It also has a big space in the middle where you can store more polish. Great buy worth the price very satisfied.</li>
    <li> The customer service was wonderful - they were very quick to respond and extremely helpful. However, please be aware that this revolving nail polish display rack is NOT the one that allows for storage in the center. I know the description does not state that, but the customer photos and reviews are very misleading as they do indicate the top will come off for storage. That was the only thing I was disappointed in. Otherwise, a great product at a reasonable price and great service.</li>
    <li> Love it! So happy with my purchase.. ❤️</li>
    <li> Nice Organization rack for my Opi nail polish and other brands I have. You must have plenty of space for this rack, it&#x27;s big but it displays your nail polish nicely and also rotates so you can check your entire collection.</li>
    <li> The shipping was uber quick and there was no assembly required. It was packaged well and It was ready to use! Fits all my nail polishes (most sizes) and it looks really neat. looks super legit, something you would find at a salon. It was so worth it!!!</li>
    <li> If you have alot of polish and have a hard time seeing what you have, this is for you. This is worth the money. It held all my polish. I like that it does spin and it&#x27;s not big or bulky that it will take up alot of room. It&#x27;s nice cause now I can see all my polishes and organize them by color. Get it, you will not regret it.</li>
    <li> It turned out I have more polishes than space and unless you break the top to get to the empty space in the centre,  I tried, you only have what&#x27;s visible to you. It holds about 120 full sized kleancolor polishes with a little space left over for the old wet n wild bottles</li>
    <li> I was very excited about getting this product, however; it came in the mail broken. Then I sent it back to be shipped again. It was broken even worse then the first! Wouldn&#x27;t recommend getting another if it came broken the first time. Just wasted a lot of time.</li>
    <li> Great product. Keeps all my nail polishes organized.</li>
    <li> I ordered this to hold my huge collection of Sephora OPI nailpolish.&lt;br /&gt;Only the top row is tall enough to hold those bottles.&lt;br /&gt;But this is one sturdy, nicely made piece.  It arrived in perfect shape.  Nothing was broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep it and order a second rack of my taller bottles.</li>
    <li> Mine arrived damaged,a huge hole in it and a crack on the side. however the rack itself is brilliant. Very nice to store polish.</li>
    <li> Good quality. Spins great. The only thing missing is something more creative in the big open center. A little too deep to easily store things.</li>
    <li> It arrived in great condition in a sturdy box with good protection due to cardboard placers and bubble wrap.  It is well made and spins easily. I have 200 + bottles of polish and it holds 160 of my polishes (I&#x27;m going to buy a second one). I was concerned that the shelves wouldn&#x27;t be deep enough to hold the big bottles like Orly and Sally Hansen Complete Salon Manicure but these fit just fine.  The &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; size bottles such as Essie, OPI, L&#x27;Oreal Paris etc. easily fit.  Sephora by OPI is too tall but they fit on the top shelf.  Yes, the &amp;#34;Nail Center&amp;#34; topper is cheesy looking but it is not attached and so you can just leave it off. I highly recommend this product if you have a lot of nail polish and want to be able to see your collection.</li>
    <li> Love it! A piece came broken but I just glued it back on and haven&#x27;t had an issue since.</li>
    <li> For any woman with tons of polish like myself, this is an absolute must have!! Very well made, sturdy and nice looking once filled..the only complaint/issue I&#x27;d have is, make sure you have the space to hold such a thing. If your bedroom is on the smaller size (Like mine is) it will stand out. Make sure you have somewhere you can place it, so that it&#x27;s able to be rotated when wanting to browse all the polishes!</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish rack!!! I was so worried about the rack being broke while being delivered, but it was in perfect shape. I also like that I can remove the top excess to the middle for extra storage.</li>
    <li> Please do not waste your time thinking about buying this item.  BUY IT, BUY IT, BUY IT.....Super fast shipping.  There are no words to describe how happy I am with this purchase.  I love the spinning feature.  It holds alot of nail polish and I love the middle of the display ...it is deep and that is were I store my cotton balls, nail polish remover, etc.  You will kick yourself once you get it and say....hmmm I should have purchase something like this years ago. LOL LOL LOL&lt;br /&gt;Memphis-nail polish lover for life!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This was my favorite nail polish rack.  It fit my sizable collection neatly and was easy to swivel it around to see what I had.  The acrylic is sturdy.  The only complaint I have it that it was hard to squeeze some of the oversized bottles in-some of them just barely fit.  But that is a small quibble.  I would still be using this if my collection hadn&#x27;t outgrown it.</li>
    <li> I am using this as an e-liquid flavoring display.&lt;br /&gt;It holds far more bottles than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;It has 5 tiers and 4 sides.&lt;br /&gt;The top tear holds 44 10ml bottles. 11 on each side. That is 220 bottles per rack&lt;br /&gt;This rack also holds 30ml bottles good. In fact it is better for 30ml than 10ml bottles.&lt;br /&gt;There is a lot of front to back wiggle room with the 10ml bottle. Bottles are not falling because of this.&lt;br /&gt;Since I do not have enough bottles to fill the whole rack up I separated the bottles so that the shelf looked full.&lt;br /&gt;The bottles will fall over from left to right when you bump them; which is very easy.&lt;br /&gt;These shelves are good for much more than nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;Over all I am happy at the moment.&lt;br /&gt;They are getting four stars because I think the price was too high. But I did buy them so I guess it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!!!! This thing rocks! It is beautiful! I just got my 2nd one and I&#x27;m taking it to the salon Monday to fill it up!</li>
    <li> The nicest polish rack of any kind that I have ever seen. Very nice in appearance and function. Not only looks great but revolves very smoothly. Has a classy look to it. I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> We picked up a couple a few days ago and received it in excellent condition. The seller delivered in record time compared to any other non-prime/Amazon vendor. I was a bit hesitant about getting this as the pictures show that little sign (Nails Polish Center) which we didn&#x27;t need. Simply remove it and flip the top cover over and it&#x27;s &amp;#34;plain&amp;#34; as displayed. These will look great in our shop!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to pick up some more.</li>
    <li> love them, they hold a ton of polish</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have enough wall space for a wall rack, so I came across this and read the reviews and decided to go for it! WELL worth the $70! It fits my entire nail polish collection and looks so sleek and professional, and it doesn&#x27;t take up much room. Everyone is so jealous!&lt;br /&gt;I love that I can finally see my entire nail polish collection. It&#x27;s so organized and looks so amazing! There are 4 sides with 5 shelves each, but two sides of the rack that are larger than the other two sides:&lt;br /&gt;The larger side holds up to 10 essie bottles per shelf, and 8 OPI bottles; while the more narrow side holds 8 essie bottles and 6 OPI bottles. So if you have an entire essie-sized bottle collection, you can actually fit up to 180 bottles. If you have all Orly/OPI-sized nail polish bottles, you can fit 140.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I put 4 stars is because it shipped broken. One of the bottom shelves was entirely broken off. I&#x27;m not sure how it broke because the box it shipped in didn&#x27;t seem to be damaged at all. However, the rack was not really wrapped well. It was just loosely covered in styrofoam popcorn. I managed to superglue it temporarily, but it left an ugly scar (see uploaded images). I&#x27;ve contacted the company and they said they would ship a \\&quot;replacement shelf\\&quot; right away, but I&#x27;m not really sure how I&#x27;m supposed to install just one shelf?? I will update once I receive it!</li>
    <li> It is ok but u was very disappointed it did not swivel.</li>
    <li> my girlfriend loved her nail polish rack</li>
    <li> I bought this to organize my nail polish bottles at home. I like its overall appearance as I got the one pictured in the display image. It has a lot of room and it fits my 130+ bottles perfectly. I own a lot of Kleancolor, Essie, Orly, Pure Ice, Sally Hansen Xtreme Wear, China Glaze, and a few stripers. They all fit nicely, but I gave it three stars for the horribly pitiful box it came in, and the broken product. See, although I said all of my polishes fit the rack and it&#x27;s pretty, the whole bottom half of the rack was shattered when I received it. When I say shattered I mean I have many jagged, broken pieces of black and clear plastic that should have made up one side of the rack&#x27;s shelves. If you want to buy this product, be prepared for this. I also work at a professional nail salon, and I recommend you buy a round, metal revolving rack if you really want to organize your polish; they&#x27;re durable and lasting.</li>
