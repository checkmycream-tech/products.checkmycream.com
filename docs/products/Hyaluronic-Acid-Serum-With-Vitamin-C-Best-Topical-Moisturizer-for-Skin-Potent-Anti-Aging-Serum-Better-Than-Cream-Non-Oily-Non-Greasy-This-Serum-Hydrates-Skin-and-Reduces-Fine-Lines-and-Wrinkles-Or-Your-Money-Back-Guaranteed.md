      <li>The fine lines have been reduced, leaving my skin soft and glowing.    </li>
      <li>so at first I was scared to use it.  </li>

      <li>It makes my skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>My face feels soft and smooth -</li>

      <li>With consistent use I feel like I can tell a positive difference in my skin.  </li>
      <li>Because of this I rarely try new products.  </li>
      <li>so well I can actually see a change in fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing.</li>

      <li>Applies very easily and after the first try my skin felt softer and smoother.&lt;br /&gt;Takes very little of the product for complete coverage.  </li>
      <li>My wrinkles are not as defined as they used to be, and the more I use the less</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only used this product for a week and my face is so soft and smooth.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Is very good for mu skin</li>
    <li> I have only used this twice, as it has just arrived. I hope I remember to review when I&#x27;ve given the product satisfactory time to work, one way or another.</li>
    <li> first time ever using any type vitamin c serum, and have used 75% and have not had any good results, I think it has cause me more acne. Fine lines and wrinkles look worse.</li>
    <li> Wonderful stuff..I want more!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing serum. It goes on light with no oily residue like other serums. Very moisturizing. I have used it for a week and love the results.</li>
    <li> I really like this serum. It makes my skin feel soft and smooth. I used this everyday for a week then missed a day and I could really tell a difference. I haven&#x27;t missed a day since. I would definitely recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Wow! I love it. Everyone comments on how smooth my skin looks, and it feels great. Really see less lines and unevenness.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have tried, and for the price, it rocks.  Feels great, applies, wonderfully, love the stopper, covers like a dream, can&#x27;t believe this product for the price, used along with ther derma roller and you willl never use anything else.  Your face is the greeter to the world, this keeps it looking it&#x27;s best.</li>
    <li> I’ve been using this product for about a week and a half and have seen nothing but positive results. My skin is softer and the serum smoothed out the fine lines around my mouth and eyes. I also use it on my neck and under my chin.  As it states on the box, a little really does go a long way. Just a few drops and the serum can be spread over your entire face.  This product is not greasy and does not leave any sort of residue. My favorite thing about this product is the price, can’t beat it! Plus it is always nice to use a skin care product that was not tested on animals!</li>
    <li> Love feeling moisturized without feeling oily or greasy. This serum is fantastic, amazed at how so little will go such a long way. My 42 year old skin looks healthier and younger!!</li>
    <li> This product feels so good on your skin.  Applies very easily and after the first try my skin felt softer and smoother.&lt;br /&gt;Takes very little of the product for complete coverage.  Would highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;Tricia</li>
    <li> I am severely allergic to so many ingredients and when I use products that contain gluten I break out in a rash that stings.  It takes a lot of research to find a product that doesn&#x27;t contain all of the list of allergens or gluten.  Because of this I rarely try new products.  I am so happy that the ingredients used in this product are sensitive enough even for my skin. I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over a month and I&#x27;ve noticed my skin feels smoother, the lines under by eyes are a little less defined and my normally oily skin doesn&#x27;t shine in the middle of the day but doesn&#x27;t feel dry either.  Love the way the product makes my skin look and feel plus you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a month now and I love it.  I have been putting it around my eyes and with no harsh chemicals in it, it does not irritate my eyes.  My skin is softer and seems to be glowing.  I will continue to use this product and will order more when I finish my first bottle.  And yes, a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Wonder moisturizer! I have been using this product for over 2 weeks and found my skin to look younger.  The fine lines have been reduced, leaving my skin soft and glowing.    Friends have even noticed the change and have asked what I have been using.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I must admit I was skeptical even with the rave reviews.  But I can truly say that I am thoroughly impressed with the results from the use of this product.  The lines on my face are starting to smooth out and the skin in those areas seemed to have &amp;#34;plumped&amp;#34; up somewhat.  I can definitely see what everyone is talking about.  I will be buying more very shortly.</li>
    <li> Really great product, you can see and feel the difference in your face, my skin looks radiant.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month and I love the feel and look if my skin! I have oily skin and I no longer get shiny skin in the afternoon but the best part is my skin doesn&#x27;t feel dried out. When I first apply it feels like silk on my skin! I love it!</li>
    <li> The serum makes my skin feel supple and smooth.  I apply it usually only once a day, in the morning, but sometimes at night as well.  It moisturizes nicely and a little goes a long way.  I feel that it acts as a nice primer for makeup, too.  I wear a moisturizer with an SPF over it in the daytime, but that&#x27;s only for the sunscreen.  I have not experienced any breakouts because of the serum.  With consistent use I feel like I can tell a positive difference in my skin.  The serum is not greasy at all and absorbs quickly into the skin - can&#x27;t even tell I have a &amp;#34;moisturizer&amp;#34; on my face, which I love.  I appreciate that it has no fragrance or color added.  I&#x27;m interested to see what continued use can do for my skin!</li>
    <li> I like to use a product for a while before I write a review... I have been using this for over two months now and can most definitely see a difference in my skin. My skin seems fuller.  This helped my skin by hydrating it so well I can actually see a change in fine lines and wrinkles. I am a flight attendant that works in a very dehydrating environment and using this twice a day has truly been wonderful and has made a visible difference. So much so that my friends are asking about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only criticism is that the directions for use were kind of vague. I asked my esthetician how to use it properly and I love the results!!</li>
    <li> I have only been using the serum for a few weeks now, but love it so far!</li>
    <li> Really like this product. The texture of my skin feels smoother already!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Have been using daily for several weeks now, and love that it is absorbed quickly into the skin and leaves a nice finish for applying moisturizer.  Skin feels great and I look forward to seeing additional results in the future.</li>
    <li> This product really works.  I had a stubborn crease near my lips.  The kind that suck off lipstick.  That crease is gone.  Crow&#x27;s feet gone.</li>
    <li> I really love this serum, I also love the fact that it isn&#x27;t greasy or heavy on my skin.  I read that anything with hyaluronic acid &amp; vitamin C is the best way to fight wrinkles so that is why I bought it!</li>
    <li> Good product ... helps diminish fine lines.  My skin looks and feels great.</li>
    <li> I have been using Rejuvier for 1 week and it has made a significant difference in my skin.  It cleared up my acne and my brown spots and freckles are lighter.  I use it twice a day followed by SkinMedical Rejuvenative Moisturizer.  I have tried hundreds of skin products and this is one I definitely would recommend that you try.</li>
    <li> just what i ordered. a great product.</li>
    <li> i love it a little strong at first but sure skin will adjust to it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product for a week and my face is so soft and smooth.  I also use it on my neck and my wrinkles are already disappearing.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Awful.  Never buy this product! It made me breakout horribly on my face.  I look like a monster. Save your money for a product that works.</li>
    <li> I can definitely see the difference and it has made me so much more confident! I&#x27;m so glad I bought this product and will be purchasing more as soon as I run out.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for a month and am really pleased with the way my skin looks and feels.  With other products I noticed that about mid-day, my face would start to feel dry.  I haven&#x27;t had that feeling since I&#x27;ve started using Rejuvier.  It goes on very smooth and is absorbed by my skin quickly.  I have also noticed less fine lines.  I feel that it is also very economical, a little goes a long way. I am really happy with it and plan to continue using it.</li>
    <li> I have been using the moisturizer for about 1 week now - and I really like the way it makes my face feel.  The dropper is a great way to control the amount you use - keeps me from over using the product - and it makes it go further.  My face feels soft and smooth - and I don&#x27;t get the mid day oily feeling that I got with my other moisturizer.  The price is awesome - and I will continue to use this great moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This serum is awesome!  I&#x27;ve seen a difference in my skin in just a few weeks.  I&#x27;ll be a lifetime customer!!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t think of the right word except for what this product really seemed to do, which was &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34; out my skin-tone and texture. From the first day I used it, I found my face to look more supple and fine lines diminished because skin just looked (and felt) hydrated and smooth (that word again). I used on my face, neck and chest (areas commonly exposed to sun) underneath moisturizer, but one afternoon was going somewhere and decided to apply a little as a refresher without moisturizer afterwards, it really did refresh the skin and again, just &amp;#34;smoothed&amp;#34; it out. I like the dropper applicator as I seem to control how much I use much better. The product is instantly absorbed, lightweight and feels good when applying. Cost is great too. I like the product, noticeable results in a short time and I will continue to use it and recommend it.</li>
    <li> Good moisturizer, I expected better  results but does the job.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this product my skin felt tighter.  The bottle says to apply two times per day and I have been getting good results with that. I also used this on the back of my hands and I can tell that they feel smoother and look younger.  I would definitely recommend this product and will buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this serum, the bottle says to apply two times per day but I have been getting good results just using once a day.  I have sensitive skin so at first I was scared to use it.  But I am glad I used it, I thought my face was smooth but this serum made it feel smoother. I would definitely recommend this product and will buy again. And a little bit goes a long way.  My wrinkles are not as defined as they used to be, and the more I use the less I feel them.</li>
    <li> No noticeable improvement at all</li>
    <li> This is the best product i ever use, you will see results on the very first day</li>
    <li> excellent product, keeps your skin hydrated.</li>
    <li> I simply love this product. I&#x27;m amazed everyday how it has changed the appearance of my skin.</li>
