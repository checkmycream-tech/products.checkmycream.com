      <li>of all on the rare occasion when I whip out the heat and go for a straight look my hair is so well nourished that I don&#x27;t have to worry about damage or dryness.</li>
      <li>I would describe it as soapy, in a very positive, clean laundry kind of way, but with just a hint of something botanical to give it a little oomph!)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried some extremely expensive high end brand conditioners, which were phenomenal, but this is the absolute best &#x27;basic&#x27; brand option out there!here!</li>

      <li>I would normally seek out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>When I saw my old red bottles for both shampoo and conditioner, though there seemed to be a name change, it was easy to assume it was the same product</li>
      <li>I love my long hair and I love dying it and styling it and straightening it on a whim, but the fact that it is dry to begin with makes all of that really hard sometimes.</li>
      <li>This conditioner keeps my naturally curly hair moisture, shiny and soft.  </li>
      <li>Bought the big bottle on Amazon for a reasonable price</li>
      <li>I have nearly hip length hair</li>

      <li>This conditioner makes your hair curly and soft.  </li>
      <li>it makes my hair shiny soft and curly</li>
      <li>My mother likes this particular Pantene product line, but didn&#x27;t like the prices in the local stores.  </li>
      <li>I leave a little on after rinsing it out and it makes the curls super springy and defined.</li>
      <li>Now a year later and my hair is back to what it was thanks to Pantene for curly hair products.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Pantene for years, starting when it was a fairly high-end, moderately expensive product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Pantene... you need to bring back your old formula.</li>
      <li>Our whole family uses this with no drawbacks for any of us, but me and my little curly haired man couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
      <li>My hair became so dry and brittle from not getting properly washed and all the medications I was given particularly the blood thinners.</li>
      <li>Last year I had a major illness and was in the hospital for months.</li>

<li> The conditioner is so heavy that my curls have no definition.&lt;br</li>

<li> It sucks.</li>
<li> that \\&quot;red\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean what you&#x27;re used to.  </li>
<li> See, my one son also has thick and curly hair and need sot condition whenever he washes or else there is no way we can get a brush through it!</li>
<li> and there&#x27;s an annoying slime left on the tub, so</li>
<li> There is nothing wrong with the product it just was not for my hair.</li>
<li> /&gt;Only thing that&#x27;s disappointing is this was dropped from subscribe and save</li>
<li> Impossible to find this type Pantene in stores.</li>
<li> I was thinking I&#x27;d just gotten a bad perm...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Sometimes I try something else but I always end up coming back.  It&#x27;s a good product and not over-priced.  Love the pump on this, too.</li>
    <li> My mother likes this particular Pantene product line, but didn&#x27;t like the prices in the local stores.  Bought the big bottle on Amazon for a reasonable price and I think it will last her all year...</li>
    <li> I love Pantene products and this conditioner is no exception.  This conditioner keeps my naturally curly hair moisture, shiny and soft.  I love how easy my hair is to style and looks great all day.  No more dry, frizzy problems.  Definitely a winner.</li>
    <li> I have nearly hip length hair very wavy/curly and this is a washing must have.  This is the only conditioner that (when paired with water, i.e., combed during rinsing) literally makes any tangles slide apart.  There&#x27;s no pulling or tearing.  I even use it to style my hair (done sparingly) My hair has none of the dryness it used to have before.  This bottle is huge but with my hair is just what the doctor ordered :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing that&#x27;s disappointing is this was dropped from subscribe and save so i don&#x27;t have the option to buy it at the low price anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t give Pantene all of the credit for the softness I now enjoy as it&#x27;s been a years long search to find the working combo that I have now. In case you&#x27;re wondering I use also Fructis Triple Nutrition three-minute undo dry reversal treatment for deep conditioning and Herbal Essences long term relationship as a leave-in.  They complement each other and what I end up with is extremely soft wonderful smelling hair that&#x27;s not overly perfumed. I&#x27;m thrilled to add that I use sub &amp; save for both of those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of all on the rare occasion when I whip out the heat and go for a straight look my hair is so well nourished that I don&#x27;t have to worry about damage or dryness.</li>
    <li> My local Target have stopped stocking this so I bought it here. It&#x27;s the best cheap conditioner for my super curly hair. I leave a little on after rinsing it out and it makes the curls super springy and defined. I really hope they&#x27;re not discontinuing it, because even the &amp;#34;specialist&amp;#34; products that cost a bomb don&#x27;t do such a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Might have to stock up...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Pantene for years, starting when it was a fairly high-end, moderately expensive product. I loved the old \\&quot;Hydrating Curls,\\&quot; but I really have no use for this new stuff.  I don&#x27;t like the smell.  My hair doesn&#x27;t shine.  The conditioner is so heavy that my curls have no definition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I notice that they keep dropping the price, but they could give it away and I wouldn&#x27;t use it again.&lt;br /&gt;Bye, Pantene.</li>
    <li> This is my all time fave shampoo and seems to be discontinued.  I have long hair, and this shampoo and conditioner has worked great for me for years.  Can no longer find it in stores, and other formulations don&#x27;t work as well. Will keep ordering from Amazon as long as they carry it.</li>
    <li> This conditioner makes your hair curly and soft.  It&#x27;s huge so it will last for awhile.  This product will leave you with soft, clean, moisturized, good smelling hair.</li>
    <li> My hair has two negatives going for it:&lt;br /&gt;#1 My hair is curly, which by nature is dry&lt;br /&gt;#2 It&#x27;s color treated; specifically, lightened &#x3D;p&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About six months ago I stumbled upon this Pantene Curly conditioner .&lt;br /&gt;OMG, it&#x27;s a miracle.  It leaves my hair in ringlets, with lots of shine.  Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love having curly hair, but it needs special treatment.&lt;br /&gt;A &#x27;curl specialist&#x27; gave me the best way to take care of my curls.&lt;br /&gt;Wet hair, slather a good, hydrating conditioner like Pantene Curly throughout the length of your hair and on the ends.  Then flip your head forward, so your hair hangs down toward the shower floor and wash just your scalp and roots with whatever shampoo you like.  When you&#x27;re done washing your scalp, flip your head back over and rinse everything out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other key to creating curls is using ONLY a microfiber towel on your hair (ANY microfiber towel, you don&#x27;t need a &#x27;hair towel&#x27;, any microfiber towel will do... from the $1 Store.) Microfiber wicks up moisture which causes your curls spring-forth, not being weighted down by water.  Squeeze, don&#x27;t rub your hair.  By now the curls should already be forming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This plan should leave you with well defined curls that are perfectly ready for whatever styling you&#x27;d like to use.</li>
    <li> I love this I had it on my list of subscribe and save.but it&#x27;s been discontinued I will check I  a few months to see if they get it back. it makes my hair shiny soft and curly</li>
    <li> Impossible to find this type Pantene in stores. Was very glad to find the conditioner and shampoo in large quantity bottles at reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Smooth and Shiny is the result that I can only get from using Pantene.  After trying many many different brands, I haven&#x27;t found anything comparable.</li>
    <li> this is the best conditioner that works on my frizzy curly hair....will switch with pantene and other p&amp;g products for my hair</li>
    <li> I have been using Pantene shampoo and conditioner for many years. My hair is very natural curly and prone to becoming dry. Last year I had a major illness and was in the hospital for months. My hair became so dry and brittle from not getting properly washed and all the medications I was given particularly the blood thinners. When I came home the beautician who cuts my hair immediately noticed it had completely changed texture. I went back on my Pantene hair care wash and condition regimen and there was a noticeable change almost immediately. Now a year later and my hair is back to what it was thanks to Pantene for curly hair products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner for years, and now this is the only conditioner I use.  It keeps my curls in place and the frizz down.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this type of conditioner in the local stores and I didn&#x27;t want to pay salon prices. So, therefore, I went on Amazon and searched for this type of conditioner, as I had previously sampled at a salon. This conditioner does not leave my hair oily, nor does it weigh down my natural waves. I am very satisfied with the way it moisturizes my hair without that greasy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I do not have to use much of this conditioner---only the size of a dime rubbed into the strands of my hair. This Pantene conditioner has salon quality without the expensive price and highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Pantene&#x27;s products tend to be color-coded, and red is for curly hair.  When I saw my old red bottles for both shampoo and conditioner, though there seemed to be a name change, it was easy to assume it was the same product renamed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrong.  Sometime around 2011 Pantene did a formula change.  You may have bought (and liked, as I did) the old \\&quot;Dry to Moisturized\\&quot; or \\&quot;Hydrating Curls\\&quot;.  For my hair, these were both very good and curl defining, and kept my hair in good shape despite its being fine and permed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then came \\&quot;Moisture Renewal\\&quot;.  For me, the shine is gone, the curls are gone, no definition... and there&#x27;s an annoying slime left on the tub, so I can only imagine what it&#x27;s doing to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m only catching the formula change now, as I tend to stock up on shampoo and conditioner on sale and I sure do miss the old stuff.  A call to Pantene today confirmed my perception of this change... and their rep didn&#x27;t even try to recommend something more suitable, or offer a coupon or anything in the way of an apology.  Visited Panetene&#x27;s site as well, only to find others posting there as unhappy as me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, just a heads up that \\&quot;red\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean what you&#x27;re used to.  I was thinking I&#x27;d just gotten a bad perm... then I dug out one of the old \\&quot;Hydrating Curls\\&quot; bottles I had, and in 2 days I knew what the issue was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pantene... you need to bring back your old formula.</li>
    <li> This product was just not right for my hair. There is nothing wrong with the product it just was not for my hair. I passed it on to my friend and she loves it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product if you have curly or wavy hair.</li>
    <li> I have really really long, wavy, thick, and somewhat dry hair. It sucks. I love my long hair and I love dying it and styling it and straightening it on a whim, but the fact that it is dry to begin with makes all of that really hard sometimes. I don&#x27;t like using a ton of product, and this conditioner replaces a lot of spray conditioners and other manageability related items I would normally seek out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This truly leaves my hair feeling moisturizes, silky, manageable, and so SO easy to comb through. Which is a huge deal when you have thick long hair! I occasionally will try out other conditioners and shampoos but always find myself coming back to Pantene. I&#x27;ve even had compliments on how my hair smelled after washing it!&lt;br /&gt;This is really a great product and I&#x27;m so thrilled to have found a larger size bottle with a pump! See, my one son also has thick and curly hair and need sot condition whenever he washes or else there is no way we can get a brush through it! This bottle with the pump top is perfect for him! He can pump out just as much as he needs, no more accidental over squeezing and leaving a conditioner-slick in the shower! So thrilled!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also leaves his hair amazingly soft and supple and shiny and just beautiful! Our whole family uses this with no drawbacks for any of us, but me and my little curly haired man couldn&#x27;t live without it. If you are looking for a great regular use product that doesn&#x27;t give a lot of buildup, smells fresh and clean, and really truly leaves your hair more moisturized and so much more manageable, definitely give this a go.&lt;br /&gt;(The scent of this conditioner is a bit floral, but definitely not in n overly feminine way. I would describe it as soapy, in a very positive, clean laundry kind of way, but with just a hint of something botanical to give it a little oomph!)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried some extremely expensive high end brand conditioners, which were phenomenal, but this is the absolute best &#x27;basic&#x27; brand option out there!here!</li>
