### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Sleep, hydrate, and use concealer ( the BEST is made by Cinema Secrets).</li>
      <li>Excellent cream.</li>
      <li>I like this one best!</li>
      <li>I see an improvement after using this one, so I may have found a permanent eye cream, until Avon decides to discontinue it, like they do with their best products.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
      <li>This is a wonderful product that does what it says it will do.  </li>
      <li>Very pleasant to use.</li>
      <li>Great product at a great price.</li>
      <li>I would say this is just as good of a product for 1/3</li>
      <li>This is a good cream; I&#x27;m 24</li>
      <li>Love it , great  for the eyes zone</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with my experience.</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an amazing product</li>
      <li>It was brand new and perfect.  </li>
      <li>Tried this on a whim, hoping futiley for the best results short of cosmetic-eye surgery and was delighted to find it DOES work...</li>
      <li>and I was glad to find it.</li>
      <li>My favorite, does it work..</li>
      <li>What it DID do was make my eyes look more awake</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>This eye cream is outstanding.  </li>
      <li>Always pleased..</li>
      <li>I love this eye cream.</li>
      <li>I have ordered this eye cream from my Avon representative on many occasions.  </li>
      <li>It is nice, but I can&#x27;t really say if it is effective or not.</li>
      <li>More importantly,  I understand that Avon does animal testing in countries in which it&#x27;s required to do so.  </li>
      <li>With one weeks&#x27; use, I can already see my fine lines softened.</li>
      <li>I highly, very highly recommend this product!!!</li>
      <li>It works ok but is really pricey..</li>
      <li>If you have sensitive eyes that tear up from eye creams (like me), you will love this product.</li>
      <li>and the results are worth the price.</li>
      <li>I was hoping for the best,  but alas at best this product merely moisturizes</li>
      <li>No matter how good the moisture (and it did moisturize the under eye area, it just didn&#x27;t improve the wrinkle situation), the price in animal lives is not worth it.  </li>
      <li>I like the product very much.</li>
      <li>Thanks again!</li>
      <li>Though to use it just once isn&#x27;t sufficient as the first application soaks into your lid &amp; surrounding eye-area as it should, then I&#x27;ll apply the rest of my facial moisturizer, then re-apply and smooth around another dollop of eye-cream till the entire eye is smooth and moist with product.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a very high quality eye cream.</li>
      <li>but I also don&#x27;t really have wrinkles yet.</li>
      <li>It provides great moisturizing without irritating my eyes.</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t think I needed to use as much either.  </li>
      <li>I ordered this for more than half off what AVON sells it for.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Avon Genics Eye Treatment, and in a short term I don&#x27;t see evident fast results, maybe in time!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Inititally I was unimpressed but that was due with trying to be cheap about how much I applied</li>
      <li>It really makes my eyes feel young.  </li>
      <li>I work outside in all weather, different parts of my face require different amounts of moisturizers to be effective and so with that knowledge I use as  needed and am very happy with the results, the ultimate compliment coming when least expected of my appearance being no</li>
      <li>I live in the desert and this is a luxurious cream that hydrates without being greasy.</li>
      <li>I usually use what I buy and search for something else better.  </li>
      <li>I use this product daily and it is reasonable and convenient for me to order from you!</li>
      <li>This is the first time I have purchased a second bottle.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 67 years old</li>
      <li>Leaves my skin feeling velvety soft (even by the end of the day), moisturized and resilient.</li>
      <li>so it makes you&#x27;d skin feel soft after you apply it.  </li>
      <li>Maybe my skin Is too sensitive.</li>
      <li>- shame on me for being so miserly, nothing can work if you don&#x27;t allow it to maximise it&#x27;s potential by short-shrifting how much you need to use for yourself.</li>
      <li>My skin has smoothed out and I am now going without foundation frequently.  </li>
      <li>Only other eye cream that I could ever rely on was Clinique All About Eyes Rich.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this for visible smoothing and overall evening out of skin tone.</li>
      <li>I can have a late night out and on barely any sleep and still look fresh as a daisy thanks to this.</li>
      <li>But in general, I like and I recommend Anew.</li>
      <li>Makes my eyes feel moisturized and not dry.  </li>
      <li>I saw the reviews and was really excited to get this because I&#x27;m in my late 30s and am starting to see some pesky wrinkles under my eyes.  </li>
      <li>I used to get these little red dots in the corners where my early crows feet are, probably dry irritated skin - those were gone in the first 24 hours.</li>
      <li>where near my real given age by at least a decade</li>
</ol>

<li> /&gt;It is a thick, luxurious cream.</li>
<li> No more Avon for this girl!</li>
<li> The bonus is it is much less expensive than buying through Avon.  </li>
<li> Thick and pasty it applies and spreads about as smoothly as cold peanut butter.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I can not believe what this cream has done for my face/eye area. I can have a late night out and on barely any sleep and still look fresh as a daisy thanks to this. This has renewed my entire eye area and makes me look 5 years younger! I am still in shock by how well this cream works. I highly, very highly recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> It works ok but is really pricey..</li>
    <li> Received on time. I like the product very much.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product that does what it says it will do.  Helps puffiness around eyes.  The bonus is it is much less expensive than buying through Avon.  I love it!</li>
    <li> This is probably the only eye cream I have used up and bought another jar.  I usually use what I buy and search for something else better.  I see an improvement after using this one, so I may have found a permanent eye cream, until Avon decides to discontinue it, like they do with their best products.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say I look ten years younger, but it helps to think so.</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream. I have tried every OTC line up to $25 and nothing has wowed me. Only other eye cream that I could ever rely on was Clinique All About Eyes Rich. I would say this is just as good of a product for 1/3 the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a thick, luxurious cream. Leaves my skin feeling velvety soft (even by the end of the day), moisturized and resilient. Wears well under makeup, I use it AM and PM. I used to get these little red dots in the corners where my early crows feet are, probably dry irritated skin - those were gone in the first 24 hours. With one weeks&#x27; use, I can already see my fine lines softened. Can&#x27;t wait to see the results with continued use!!!</li>
    <li> I have been ordered this eye crème for a while now.  Seems I am hooked on it.  Makes my eyes feel moisturized and not dry.  Seems to help with my wrinkles.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price. This item has been discontinued by Avon and I was glad to find it.</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive eyes that tear up from eye creams (like me), you will love this product. I&#x27;m in my late thirties, have had oily skin all my life and a tendency to break out with eye creams- this didn&#x27;t cause any break outs. What it DID do was make my eyes look more awake ( other people noticed it, wasn&#x27;t all in my wishful mind) and plumped my crepey eye area with moisture. Won&#x27;t solve dark circles- but no cream can. Sleep, hydrate, and use concealer ( the BEST is made by Cinema Secrets). I hope they never discontinue this, a little product goes a long way- and the results are worth the price.</li>
    <li> This is a very high quality eye cream. I typically go from one eye cream to another.  This is the first time I have purchased a second bottle.  I live in the desert and this is a luxurious cream that hydrates without being greasy.</li>
    <li> I am now using the entire product line. My skin has smoothed out and I am now going without foundation frequently.  I highly recommend this for visible smoothing and overall evening out of skin tone.</li>
    <li> Thick and pasty it applies and spreads about as smoothly as cold peanut butter. Expensive and minimal effects both on firming and de-puffing the eyes. Wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
    <li> Love it , great  for the eyes zone</li>
    <li> Works well.  Like the end results</li>
    <li> Excellent cream. Very pleasant to use.</li>
    <li> My favorite, does it work..It does for me and thats all that matters.  I have always been a BIG Avon fan so that is why I am stickin&#x27; with it..!!</li>
    <li> I have ordered this eye cream from my Avon representative on many occasions.  I needed some and just happened to look on Amazon.  It was 1/2 the price and I received it in a couple of days.  I use this daily so I will be ordering it again.  Soothes the skin under and around the eye.  Helps with wrinkles and puffiness.  Love it.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is thick and creamy so it makes you&#x27;d skin feel soft after you apply it.  The jar is small so there is not a lot of cream but I don&#x27;t think I needed to use as much either.  I may buy this again if I can get it at the reduced rate otherwise it would be out of my budget range</li>
    <li> I ordered this for more than half off what AVON sells it for.  It&#x27;s an amazing product and I recommend it to all ladies.</li>
    <li> Always pleased..I use this product daily and it is reasonable and convenient for me to order from you! Thanks again!</li>
    <li> Been using this for a couple of years.  I&#x27;m 67 years old and I used the platinum eye cream but wanted one just for the eyes and felt this one did the job.</li>
    <li> I use it every morning and every night after I wash my face.  It really makes my eyes feel young.  I have only used it a few days but hope that soon it makes my eyes look as young as they feel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eyecream for 2 years. I love it! It provides great moisturizing without irritating my eyes.</li>
    <li> Big promises. I scrutinize my eye area, hoping for results. Like all the others, Olay, etc, I search in vain.</li>
    <li> This is a good cream; I&#x27;m 24 so I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference, but I also don&#x27;t really have wrinkles yet. It is nice, but I can&#x27;t really say if it is effective or not.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a ton of eye creams. I like this one best!</li>
    <li> This eye cream is outstanding.  It arrived in time, as expected.  It was brand new and perfect.  I am very pleased with my experience.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Avon Genics Eye Treatment, and in a short term I don&#x27;t see evident fast results, maybe in time! But in general, I like and I recommend Anew.</li>
    <li> I saw the reviews and was really excited to get this because I&#x27;m in my late 30s and am starting to see some pesky wrinkles under my eyes.  I was hoping for the best,  but alas at best this product merely moisturizes but I have yet to see any lessening of wrinkles over the past 2 months.  The moisture just hides them a bit.     More importantly,  I understand that Avon does animal testing in countries in which it&#x27;s required to do so.  I&#x27;d prefer to see them lose out on sales than harm animals. At the very least,  a company Avon&#x27;s size is exactly who should be using their clout to persuade foreign governments to abandon their animal testing requirements.    So,  there you have it. It didn&#x27;t work for me and they test on animals.  No matter how good the moisture (and it did moisturize the under eye area, it just didn&#x27;t improve the wrinkle situation), the price in animal lives is not worth it.  No more Avon for this girl!</li>
    <li> It burned my eye area. Maybe my skin Is too sensitive. It was a waste of money for me.</li>
    <li> Tried this on a whim, hoping futiley for the best results short of cosmetic-eye surgery and was delighted to find it DOES work... Though to use it just once isn&#x27;t sufficient as the first application soaks into your lid &amp; surrounding eye-area as it should, then I&#x27;ll apply the rest of my facial moisturizer, then re-apply and smooth around another dollop of eye-cream till the entire eye is smooth and moist with product.&lt;br /&gt;Inititally I was unimpressed but that was due with trying to be cheap about how much I applied - shame on me for being so miserly, nothing can work if you don&#x27;t allow it to maximise it&#x27;s potential by short-shrifting how much you need to use for yourself. I work outside in all weather, different parts of my face require different amounts of moisturizers to be effective and so with that knowledge I use as  needed and am very happy with the results, the ultimate compliment coming when least expected of my appearance being no where near my real given age by at least a decade, yaaaaa! Thank you Avon!!!</li>
