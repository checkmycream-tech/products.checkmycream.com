      <li>Absolutely love this for my oil rinsing.</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t get much better.</li>
      <li>love it</li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>

      <li>In fact, they feel cleaner and better, soothed</li>
      <li>If you are going to use this to add flavor to food... be advised it will take a tablespoon or more.</li>
      <li>If you are using this for more ayurvedic pursuits this is the one for you.</li>
      <li>I mix it with some castor oil for a tad better &#x27;grip&#x27;</li>
      <li>Light oil with mild sesame smell that the body and hair love!</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s great for soft skin</li>
      <li>Sesame is a natural anti-bacterial and is great for swishing between teeth and in the mouth for oil pulling of toxins out.</li>
      <li>Very light and smooth with a light scent that does not linger</li>
      <li>Has a very mild flavor.</li>
      <li>Got this for self-massage but the odor is STRONG.  </li>
      <li>The smell is somewhat strong and it is like slathering tahini on your body.  </li>
      <li>Love, love, love this pure sesame oil.  </li>
      <li>and I believe it would be a fine addition to any cooked dish or salad dressing recipe.</li>
      <li>Upon more research, I found it&#x27;s great for sore muscles, dry, irritated skin....</li>
      <li>If the scent of a product is important to you, as it is for me, this might be quite off-putting.  </li>
      <li>Excellent mouth cleanser, body moisturizer, and great for massage and or making your own custom oils using this as a base.  </li>
      <li>This is wonderful for that dryness that comes over the skin especially in winter for whole body</li>
      <li>(However, I have purchased sesame oil as a cooking ingredient and for making an Asian-inspired salad dressing.)Those who have used or are familiar with Neutrogena&#x27;s light sesame body oil.....</li>
      <li>I found the oil clear, mild tasting, and a good deal.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>It soaks in quickly.</li>
      <li>Yes I was very satisfied with the second shipment.</li>
      <li>Before I tried the light Sesame Oil, I used Coconut Oil for my Oil Pulling, but because I have very sensitive teeth, the Coconut Oil was just too strong for my teeth.</li>
      <li>I use this for daily &amp;#34;oil pulling&amp;#34; and love it!  </li>
      <li>Arrived quickly and the price is right.</li>
      <li>This oil worked great for oil pulls and beauty treatments, but had a little stronger taste than Banyan Botanicals</li>
      <li>After a while, when the oil has been absorbed into the skin, it does make your skin feel moisturized.  </li>
      <li>I got this to oil-pull, which I got about a three months worth from this bottle (shared it with another person for a week before they stopped).</li>
      <li>So far I actually really like the consistency, and the taste is also nice and mellow.</li>
      <li>And while I realize that the manufacturer of this product may not have anticipated this particular use of it and cannot therefore be blamed for the lack of effectiveness in that regard, it is well documented that sesame oil is great for this purpose and I am not having expected results, so I felt one star should be deducted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It seems to be helping, especially with all the pollen we have right now!!!</li>
      <li>This is very gentle on the mouth and gums.</li>
      <li>very fast service</li>
      <li>First off  </li>
      <li>Of course, you can add fragrance like an essential oil to the sesame oil, but because the scent of the sesame oil is quite potent, you might need to add a lot to alter this some.  </li>
      <li>i got this for both but have only use it to treat my hair - and so far the hair is more shiny and more alive.</li>
      <li>this is PURE organic sesame oil and does not have any added fragrance.</li>
      <li>I had never purchased pure sesame oil to use on my body before.</li>
      <li>Hint, take a whiff of a bottle of pure sesame cooking oil...and imagine this scent but stronger....</li>
      <li>She seems happy with it and uses it regularly for her skin, mainly the scalp, with the combination of other oils.</li>
      <li>I really like it</li>
      <li>and do not add until its at the very end of cooking.  </li>
      <li>Use this for Oil Pulling and found it to be very helpful.</li>
      <li>~very</li>
      <li>/&gt;Very highly recommend this!</li>
      <li>I have sensitive teeth, so I cannot use the majority of the whitening products that are currently available to the public.</li>
      <li>I bought this particular oil for the purpose of &#x27;oil pulling&#x27;.</li>
      <li>specially works for my dry</li>
      <li>It has worked well thus far.</li>
      <li>it warms up with soft massage and feels so soothing...</li>
      <li>Keeps my skin feeling soft and supple...even my heels and elbows.</li>
      <li>(But vitamin E has been added as a natural preservative.)  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m using it along with Peppermint oil and mustard oil as a natural toothpaste.</li>
      <li>The price is the only issue because I go through the stuff so fast.</li>
      <li>I have deducted one star, only for the fact that it doesn&#x27;t seem to be whitening my teeth all that much.</li>
      <li>Skin feels invigorated and soft.</li>
      <li>As far as the texture goes, it is very rich and thick.  </li>
      <li>Unfortunately, I am not seeing a whole lot of whitening after using nearly half the bottle.</li>

    <li> Bought it to pull. Works great</li>
    <li> I use this for daily &amp;#34;oil pulling&amp;#34; and love it!  Sesame is a natural anti-bacterial and is great for swishing between teeth and in the mouth for oil pulling of toxins out.</li>
    <li> use it for oil pulling.  glad I got it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this for oil pulling. So far I actually really like the consistency, and the taste is also nice and mellow. Great price for a quality product.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent choice for those trying to stay on the right side of dietary fat.  It&#x27;s been found that sesame oil can lower bad cholesterol and even if that&#x27;s not a problem, it&#x27;s a great oil for frying or as a butter substitute.  By going organic, you may eliminate undesirable elements that threaten health.  .........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................</li>
    <li> I bought this particular oil for the purpose of &#x27;oil pulling&#x27;. Pure sesame oil was recommended for daily swishing in the mouth to whiten teeth, among other things. I have sensitive teeth, so I cannot use the majority of the whitening products that are currently available to the public. This ayurvedic approach seemed to be the most user-friendly alternative to deal with my problem. Unfortunately, I am not seeing a whole lot of whitening after using nearly half the bottle. It DOES help with breath odor... and I noticed that when used before bed, I don&#x27;t have the typical &#x27;morning breath&#x27;, so that is a positive. It does not have an unpleasant taste, so it isn&#x27;t difficult to use for this purpose. I have deducted one star, only for the fact that it doesn&#x27;t seem to be whitening my teeth all that much. And while I realize that the manufacturer of this product may not have anticipated this particular use of it and cannot therefore be blamed for the lack of effectiveness in that regard, it is well documented that sesame oil is great for this purpose and I am not having expected results, so I felt one star should be deducted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for those of you that may plan on using this for cooking, while I have not done that, as I said, it has a very pleasant taste and I believe it would be a fine addition to any cooked dish or salad dressing recipe.</li>
    <li> Got this for self-massage but the odor is STRONG.  Will probably use it for cooking, but I definitely do not want to smell like sesame all day.</li>
    <li> Use this for Oil Pulling and found it to be very helpful. This is very gentle on the mouth and gums. Before I tried the light Sesame Oil, I used Coconut Oil for my Oil Pulling, but because I have very sensitive teeth, the Coconut Oil was just too strong for my teeth. They seemed to hurt and ache for hours after a treatment. (But the Coconut Oil did whiten my teeth however).&lt;br /&gt;With Sesame Oil, my teeth and gums have no problem at all after a treatment. In fact, they feel cleaner and better, soothed really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I will suggest to you is this: If you want to whiten teeth naturally AND Oil Pull at the same time (and do not have sensitive teeth), then you may want to just consider Coconut Oil over the Sesame Oil. However, the downside of Coconut Oil is that when it gets hard,  you have to chew on the Coconut Oil before you swish and Oil Pull which I found a hassle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> Good! It arrived today in the mail. I&#x27;m using it along with Peppermint oil and mustard oil as a natural toothpaste. Plus I&#x27;ll use it for recipes for my Asian cooking.</li>
    <li> Excellent for pulling!!</li>
    <li> Product seals were broken and leaking out.</li>
    <li> THE BEST oil to use on your face and body!</li>
    <li> Good price too. I use it for &#x27;oil pulling&#x27; - works great. The oily feel takes some getting use to though.</li>
    <li> This is ok ,its an oil so its not absorbed into the skin just sits there.....Not sure it has any re leaving effects.</li>
    <li> Slather this on after my shower...love it. No more need for toxic lotions.</li>
    <li> My yoga instructor suggested I get this for sore muscles. Upon more research, I found it&#x27;s great for sore muscles, dry, irritated skin....Goes on everything. Keeps my skin feeling soft and supple...even my heels and elbows. And when I have muscle pain...it warms up with soft massage and feels so soothing...</li>
    <li> I have used Sesame Oil before but read it is helpful for sinus problems.  I use a little each day inside each nostril.  Love it.  It seems to be helping, especially with all the pollen we have right now!!!</li>
    <li> I use this on a massage client who was having some skin irritation with the unfiltered type I bought last time. this one works well. I mix it with some castor oil for a tad better &#x27;grip&#x27;</li>
    <li> smells and tastes great.  use it and onion powder to toss the salads with.</li>
    <li> Great for pulling, feels good on skin, use it on the baby&#x27;s butt. Helps the dog&#x60;s dry skin in the summer too.</li>
    <li> I use this on my skin and can trust it won&#x27;t cause any issues.</li>
    <li> I have been &amp;#34;oil-pulling&amp;#34; with this oild for a month now, and my teeth are noticeably whiter and brighter. Oil pulling is swishing the oil in your mouth and around your teeth for 15 minutes a day. It kills mouth bacteria and whitens teeth.</li>
    <li> Life-Flo claims their product is Organic but they do not have the USDA Certification.  It is very confusing to purchase products that are USDA Certified Organic.  It would be helpful for products that are USDA Certified to be the only ones that can use the word Organic.  When you are making products for sale and desire to use only Organic, it would make searching for products much easier if there was a one stander that only USDA Certified products can claim to be Organic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ana</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s quite expensive. I got this to oil-pull, which I got about a three months worth from this bottle (shared it with another person for a week before they stopped). I don&#x27;t like Coconut so this sesame was the next best thing for pulling (according to articles).&lt;br /&gt;It worked since my gum was growing. It grew about 1-2mm of thin looking gum; however, none of the growth was where there was residing gum (the reason I started pulling)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I can afford to do this, I may trying again since it worked. Maybe I would have better results if I could continue the pulling for more than 3 months.</li>
    <li> My daughter selected this item. She seems happy with it and uses it regularly for her skin, mainly the scalp, with the combination of other oils.</li>
    <li> Very light and smooth with a light scent that does not linger</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this for my oil rinsing.</li>
    <li> I found the oil clear, mild tasting, and a good deal. Unfortunately, the plastic cap is POORLY designed. You press down on the cap to pivot the opening to pour the oil - that&#x27;s when you may notice the cap has two sharp points on the indent. Ouch. I had to grind down the two sharp plastic points with my Dremel.</li>
    <li> Yes I was very satisfied with the second shipment. This time it was sealed.</li>
    <li> This product definitely improves the quality of your life when used to moisten your sinuses through the dry months of winter, etc.</li>
    <li> love it I mix it with almond oil for a body oil 2x per day, it&#x27;s great for soft skin</li>
    <li> very fast service ~very good product~ I will order more~I am an herbalist and I&#x27;m homeopathy practitioner and  a massage therapist and this product is excellent I will order more stuff is great.</li>
    <li> This Oil is great to cook and cosmetic usage ... i got this for both but have only use it to treat my hair - and so far the hair is more shiny and more alive.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly. Has a very mild flavor. If you are going to use this to add flavor to food... be advised it will take a tablespoon or more. and do not add until its at the very end of cooking.  If you are using this for more ayurvedic pursuits this is the one for you. The taste is awesome if you are oil-pulling. Arrived quickly and the price is right.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Wonderful, mild flavor.  Organic and cold pressed.  You can&#x27;t get much better.</li>
    <li> Good assembly oil delivered quickly.</li>
    <li> Works well! I use this oil for pedicures or for hair treatments! I really like it alot! It has a slight smell but nothing offensive.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this every day as her body lotion / moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Makes the genitals nice and slippery, just as intended.</li>
    <li> Good quality and plenty for the money...</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this pure sesame oil.  Excellent mouth cleanser, body moisturizer, and great for massage and or making your own custom oils using this as a base.  A must have in my home at all times.</li>
    <li> This oil worked great for oil pulls and beauty treatments, but had a little stronger taste than Banyan Botanicals so I don&#x27;t plan to reorder it.</li>
    <li> Good quality oil. I used for oil pulling, but switched back to using coconut oil.</li>
    <li> I used this to make a face oil. It has worked well thus far.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT! I dry brush my body before showering and rub this all over my skin.  after shower no lotion needed skin is radiant! also use for oil pulling (swishing around in your mouth).  promotes great gum health and bright teeth!</li>
    <li> This is wonderful for that dryness that comes over the skin especially in winter for whole body re hydration for skin and hair! Light oil with mild sesame smell that the body and hair love!</li>
    <li> This product was purchased as a massage oil for a licensed massage therapist. I have not received any feedback from her at this time.</li>
    <li> Good very nice product</li>
    <li> Love it. I have not negatives or cons about this oil.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Arrived promptly in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected. Awesome. And it shipped faster than it was supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You!</li>
    <li> Good product but I don&#x27;t like the sesame smell.  Will use organic grape seed oil next time.</li>
    <li> I use it on my dry legs. It soaks in quickly.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the recommendations in an Ayurvedic article.  It is supposed to be beneficial as a massage oil and moisturizer.  It also purportedly has therapeutic benefits such as having anti-inflammatory and sun protection properties. I had never purchased pure sesame oil to use on my body before. (However, I have purchased sesame oil as a cooking ingredient and for making an Asian-inspired salad dressing.)Those who have used or are familiar with Neutrogena&#x27;s light sesame body oil.....This is completely different.  First off  this is PURE organic sesame oil and does not have any added fragrance. (But vitamin E has been added as a natural preservative.)  If the scent of a product is important to you, as it is for me, this might be quite off-putting.  The smell is somewhat strong and it is like slathering tahini on your body.  Hint, take a whiff of a bottle of pure sesame cooking oil...and imagine this scent but stronger....Of course, you can add fragrance like an essential oil to the sesame oil, but because the scent of the sesame oil is quite potent, you might need to add a lot to alter this some.  As far as the texture goes, it is very rich and thick.  So when this is applied on your skin it leaves a somewhat \\&quot;tacky\\&quot; feel on the skin as opposed to when you apply something like baby oil which initially leaves a slippery feel.  After a while, when the oil has been absorbed into the skin, it does make your skin feel moisturized.  Because of the scent and texture of this sesame product, and despite its moisturizing affect, I have yet to decide if I will purchase this again.

    <li> Used for after shower protection. Skin feels invigorated and soft. specially works for my dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;Its food grade so I guess you could consume it too.</li>
    <li> First time using heard great things, for use in my hair. Shiny.</li>
    <li> Best quality of sesame oil I&#x27;ve yet to use. Doesn&#x27;t smell burnt like some other sesame oils. The price is the only issue because I go through the stuff so fast.</li>
