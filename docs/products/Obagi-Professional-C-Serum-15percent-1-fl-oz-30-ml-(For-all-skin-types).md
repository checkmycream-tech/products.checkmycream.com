<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> seller is great..product is crap</li>
    <li> best serum ever. i use it everyday. a little greasy first but make skin very smooth after using it. excellent.</li>
    <li> I used many different vitamin C product.  This is the best ever.  I can see the result right away.  Skin get smoother and tighter. It last for long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve added the Obagi Professional C Serum to my Obaji routine and I love it. It makes your skin look brighter.</li>
    <li> Always buy my obaji products from Amazon and am never dissatisfied. They have the best prices on the genuine  product.</li>
    <li> The seller sent the item quickly and provided fair shipping prices to Canada for multiple items.  It is the legitimate product (not a fake) and it has not irritated my normally dry fair sensitive skin.  It did tingle a little for the first few times I applied the product but nothing ie: redness or adverse reaction from the product.  It makes my skin feel very soft and has a nice scent, nothing offensive.  I can&#x27;t say it is doing anything positive and permanent yet as it hasn&#x27;t been long enough, but that being said I like the smell and feel of the product on my skin and use it every day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what this stuff is supposed to do. I don&#x27;t notice a difference. Maybe I didn&#x27;t need it? I don&#x27;t know but if you have pigmentation in your skin I suppose this would be good for that skin type.</li>
    <li> Although the product itself is supposed to be good, this seller is obviously not selling the original product. The two bottles of 15% that I bought were very watery and different from the real one that I have used before. It&#x27;s quite apparent that they have diluted it. I feel like I am putting mineral water on my face. I would not order it from this vendor again. No wonder it&#x27;s nearly half the price.</li>
    <li> This product was sealed and boxed well, very happy about that.  I love my new serum and my skin feels great!  I have dry skin and large pores and noticed a difference immediately. I have used many products &amp; most of them high-end &amp; I am very happy with my new find.  I am 55 and  have had several clients (much younger than I) ask me recently what I use on my face because it looks so firm and soft.  I bought the eye serum as well.  I am hooked!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couole of years and it is indeed one that I prefer not to  live without. What a great antioxidant! It is less expensive on line than in a Dr.&#x27;s office. I  applaud the ones who make it available on line. Most of all, I applaud Obagi.............maker   of this wonderful vitamin c serim among many other superior products.</li>
    <li> I am 54 yars old and nowadays I only use this serum: not greasy, and keeps my skin nourished. Important to maintain the product out of light and well closed to avoid oxidation of the C vitamin.</li>
    <li> Like most anti-aging products, this one promised more than it delivered. I have been using it for about a month and don&#x27;t see any change. The product is somewhat sticky and has a very slight orange smell. I think you would be better off saving your money for a visit to a dermatologist for a deep peel.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product from my spa after receiving the best facial ... but I spent 3x as much! I&#x27;m now addicted to it -- it helped eliminate bumps that were on my forehead. My skin is smooth and more even and basically fresher.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  After using the Obagi system, my skin was always dry looking, but adding this product to the collection made all the difference.  It feels great on my skin and is absorbed wonderfully.  My skin looks and feels fantastic.  I am delighted to discover it is available on Amazon.  My doctor&#x27;s office sells this for $85 a bottle!  I&#x27;ll not be purchasing it there in the future!</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT!  SINKS INTO THE SKIN AND LEAVES IT LUMINOUS!  HAS A DROPPER LIKE A SERUM BUT SO HYDRATING!  TINGLES!  I EVEN USE THIS AROUND THE EYES-MY SKIN GLOWS! THE PRICE IS AWESOME TOO!</li>
    <li> I found an ariticle which addresses how to make your own vitamin c serum.  It mentions that the serum should be a clear liquid.  When it turns yellow is has oxidized and it not as effective.    [...]</li>
    <li> Best  buy. Recommended amazon for any purchase. Obagi is the best product for beauty skin</li>
    <li> Seller provided n writing that product is authentic - hopefully that is a truthful statement.  I am looking forward to trying this product and will purchase again if satisfied.</li>
    <li> This product is not sticky like others I have used in the past.  It absorbs well into the skin and makes my skin feel silky smooth.  My skin has also cleared up and has not irritated it at all--and I have very reactionary sensitive skin!  Worth the money and I will be buying this for a long time.</li>
    <li> I went with this 15% because I have dry skin, but as the years go on, I have developed age spots and my skin is not very smooth.  I am using the product daily and it has helped the tone and smoothness of my skin.  I use is along with the other Obagi skincare products.  Product arrived in a timely manner, sealed and in very nice condition.</li>
    <li> I have used the Obagi nu-derm products for 10 years and my skin looks amazing. The C serum makes your skin look dewy and younger. My skin has hardly aged in 10 years, all my friends want to know my secret: this is it. I am 56 and look 42 because of Obagi.</li>
    <li> I love this product it makes my make up look good, it feels good, smells great and my pores are improving. I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the fastest results. It I would purchase again. I&#x27;d give it 5 stars of the lid stayed on better I spill it everyday!</li>
    <li> Love it.  Very light, absorbs instantly.  My skin loves it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t made up my mind on this product yet.  I don&#x27;t dislike it, I just can&#x27;t decide if it is really doing anything to nourish my face.  I use it daily and will continue to do so until I finish the product.  At that point I will decide whether to continue on with this product or try something different.</li>
    <li> I just ordered all products off Amazon for the first time. I&#x27;ve only been using the products for about 5 days. One thing I noticed it that the Serum DOES NOT have an expiration date. How do i know this product isn&#x27;t old? I don&#x27;t. Fingers crossed that it works!</li>
    <li> This product contains Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, which is very bad for skin and health.  The vitamin C is not ionized, therefore hard to be absorbed by skin.  This product does you more bad than good.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  For Vitamin C facial treatment, I recommend Cellex C Advanced C Serum [[ASIN:B000HX6JRI Cellex-C Advanced-C Serum, Professional Formulation, 30 ml]]M/ref&#x3D;oh_o01_s00_i00_details)  I am still looking for a good collagen serum to use with my ultrasonic facial device. [[ASIN:B001T707XS Ezzi-Peel Ultrasound Portable Cordless Skin Spatula FDA Approved]]</li>
    <li> I am extremely pleased with this product.  Price was great, a lot cheaper than I could have purchased it locally.  Delivery was faster than I expected.</li>
    <li> Love this serum. Makes your face feel wonderful. I have recommended this serum to others. I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> Too good to be true. If you&#x27;ve ever used the real product, you&#x27;ll notice right away that this stuff is NOT it. The bottle is different from the original product. The serum is clear when the original serum is Amber colored. Not to mention it doesn&#x27;t even feel like oil! It feels like thick water. It didn&#x27;t do anything for my face, except make it smell nice. If you have $30 to waste, go ahead and buy this crap. Those 3 other \\&quot;good\\&quot; reviews have got to be phony, because this stuff is fake and a total rip off. What a sad world we live in, where people are now making imposter facial serum. So lame.</li>
    <li> I have been doing some decent research on this product, looked at various sites, compared them all. It is really hard to believe that it only costs around $30. Other sellers are actually charging around $75. Iam not quiet sure if this product is for real. Did read some reviews saying this is a fake product. I dont want to get into the hassle of returns. Also, using a fake product on your face beats the purpose of the extensive research we go through. Can anyone please let me know what you think?</li>
    <li> I use Obagi products on my face and have great skin.  I get lots of positive comments on my skin.</li>
    <li> not 100% sure it was the real deal</li>
    <li> I have been using for about 3 weeks, my skin is softer and looks better. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot.  very pleasant consistency.  Nice non greasy feel.  does not come out of the dropper too fast, which is nice because there will be less waste.</li>
    <li> This product is used with the entire Obagi system. It is great. It moisturizes the skin especially around the eyes.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It makes my skin look brighter and healthier. I was worried in the beginning that my pro acne skin would become worse (it is oil after all) and I would get a lot of pimples but it didn&#x27;t happen. Vise verse the serum seems to help to get rid of them faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing why I gave it 4 stars is that it makes my skin oily. So basically I have to use paper towels to clean my face a little bit after couple minutes of serum on my skin. This is the only way I can prevent my skin from shining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But overall, I am very satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> I love Obagi products.  This came in a very short time and it is the same high quality product I purchased from a plasic surgeon at a much more reasonable price.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I am 37 and have used this for about 6 months.  I was a sun worshiper until about 33 and then started to where sunblock everyonce and a while.  At about age 36 I started doing microderms every 8 -10 weeks.  I have dry skin.  I did not tell the aesthetician that I had started this product and when I went in after about 6 weeks of using it she was like your face has never looked better what are you using?  The sell obagi products but had not really got into the C Serum.  This is wonderful stuff to even out your skin tone and make your face look great.  I started with the 10% and now use the 15% where I plan to stay.  I use it in the a.m. with the Obagi C RX day lotion with a spf 12.  If I know I am going to have alot of sun I use the Obagi C sungard 30 spf.  I love these products.  At night I use the Obagi Nu-derm blender #5 mixed with Tretinoin Cream .025%.  I will move to the .50% of Tretinoin Cream but wanted to take it slow.  My skin is a little sensitive.  What a difference in my face, I got so frustrated messing with the department store creams.  You pay a little more but it is worth the results.  Obagi products are wonderful.  Hope this helps</li>
    <li> I started using this serum on the suggestion of an MD who specializes in laser skin treatments.  She didn&#x27;t push the whole Obaji line on me, she just said that if there was one product I should get it would be this serum.  She was right.  I definitely notice the difference in my skin.  I have large pores and my skin is like I was in my 20&#x27;s again (I&#x27;m 48).  This stuff is great and I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This product is sensational.  I had a brown spot at the top of my eyebrow that I kept covered with makeup.  I even went to an aesthetician for laser treatment and she stated that if she zapped that area my eyebrow might not grow back.  I asked her if she could possibly burn it off with some type of chemical treatment.  She ignored me when I asked that and needless to say I am not returning to her.  BUT, the Obagi serum actually made the spot flake off and eventually disappear.  I literally peeled it off with tweezers one day.</li>
    <li> I first got this product  my dermatologist and paid way more money If you can afford the whole line go for it if not pick and choose the ones you need and this one I will not be with out!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It tightens your skin and exfoliates to remove most issues on your face.  I know it works because I ran out once and was out for a few weeks and I looked older and haggard overnight.  I highly recommend this product.  I am 65 years old.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for over 10 years and was told by the Doctors what a GREAT difference it will make over the years.  They were right, I don&#x27;t have the wrinkles or problem skin most ladies have at my age...66 yrs. Love it...Worth the Money...</li>
    <li> TOO MANY CHEMICAL I gave 2 a friend as to I have asthma, and it effect it so if you have asthma I suggest not to buy, I was born asmatic</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years and absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> This is the best product ever!! The only thing that has worked for me in 25 years and trust me, I have tried everything! My breakouts are under control. My coloring and scarring has improved so much!</li>
    <li> I know many reviews say this is not the real deal but I think it is. I have used this product for a long time and when I found it on amazon I was skeptical to purchase it. If it is a fake it is the best I have ever seen. Even my esthetician said my skin looks very hydrated. I will continue to purchase it from amazon.</li>
    <li> I had heard about vitamin C and skin care. I have been using this product and already see results with the texture of my skin.</li>
    <li> defin. do something good with the texture of the skin, still waiting to see some improvement on my dark acne spot, but&lt;br /&gt;you can&#x27;t always expect wonders; bought as a clear, now it&#x27;s an amber color, but vitamin C as a vitamin is very sensitive by any means, and I think this product really works, will make your skin feel softer, cleaner, brighter...</li>
    <li> Great product..love it</li>
    <li> My mom and I have oily skin and are having to touch up constantly until we started using this product.  Our skin is much more smooth, balanced, and our makeup stays on so much better!</li>
    <li> I called the Obagi company directly. They said the C serum is clear when new. The skin will tighten and pores shrink when it is working. Worked great for me.</li>
    <li> Great Product would order again</li>
    <li> Great vit C sérum for face. If you are just trying it for the first time, try 10% as this one can be too much at first. I use it first thing the morning. Apply sunscreen after using this serum, as it is an exfoliant</li>
    <li> Great product. Arrived on time</li>
    <li> I have ordered this serum from amazon in the past and been very happy with it.  However, the bottle I just received appears old and very outdated.  It did not have a plastic seal on the bottle, and so it may have been opened before I received it.  When new, this serum should be clear and feel smooth when applied,  Over time, if you don&#x27;t use it quickly enough, it will turn a faint yellow color.  Unfortunately, the bottle of serum that I just received is such a dark yellow, that it is practically brown.  It has the consistency of jelly and when I tried some, it felt like I had glue on my face.  It may be authentic Obagi serum, but it is either too old to be sold or it has been contaminated in some way (it really bugs me that the bottle did not have a seal around it).  I am returning it for a refund and am very hesitant to buy this again from amazon (which is a shame, because I also do not want to pay full price for it from a dermatologist - maybe it&#x27;s time to find a different product altogether).</li>
    <li> It honesty surprised me how fast this product shipped. When they say quick, they mean it! This product is amazing and I highly recommend it! My face glows and my skin looks amazing!</li>
    <li> hi folks, im a 62 years old male caucasian with typical sun damaged skin/brown spots etc...&lt;br /&gt;anyways to make a long story short, i had a brown rough spot over my left eyebrow for 2 years and spots on my nose (sores that did not heal well for years) and after my first night using obagi 15% c serum my spot started crumbling like an old scab and on the fourth day completely gone like never there... about my nose sores/spots, well its been close to 10 days now and they are almost non existence...&lt;br /&gt;i spent hundreds if not thousands of dollars at the dermatologist and private skin care center with facials and prescriptions that did little help if any..&lt;br /&gt;i am very satisfied... and now i use just a dab or less of obagi .05 retinoin over just the spots that are disappearing to make sure they dont come back! (kinda like Raid, get rid of the pests) lol&lt;br /&gt;i also purchased obagi Elastisity night cream for my eyes and it seems to help with fine lines etc, so i used it on my forehead cheeks and neck, and guess what? it seemed to make it all look firmer and better.. (funny thing the jar says for eyes only... guess they dont want you to know its good for other areas too!&lt;br /&gt;oh and by the way, i had a little brown spot on my lower left leg for years, and after a week of both c serum and retinoin it seems to be fading... but not crumbling like the one did over my eyebrow!&lt;br /&gt;wow, was i empressed...&lt;br /&gt;i also bought the obagi Blender but wont use it til my face is the level i want it... why? because it seemed to make all my spots on my forehead more black, and not brown like they were...&lt;br /&gt;(i think i will use it just to dab the brown spots with a q-tip only and not spread into my skin)&lt;br /&gt;... ...lol&lt;br /&gt;anyways, hope this helped some of you out there and good luck...&lt;br /&gt;:+) &lt;3</li>
    <li> fabulous on my skin.  i&#x27;ve been using it for about 5 years and my face skin is really soft.  this is after 45+ years of dreadful (and ineffective) topical medicines for acne.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my late 50&#x27;s and this really helps my skin repair and glow. I use it morning and evening...just 4 to 5 drops. Love it!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this vitamin c serum. Your face glows after a day of using it and after a few days you can see the difference it&#x27;s making.</li>
    <li> Sorry, I&#x27;ve never had break outs on my face and this product caused me to break out in rather large bumps (like acne).  I stopped using the product until the problem resolved and tried it again, and the same thing happened, so I&#x27;m not able to use this anymore. Looks like I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> Did not see improvement on my skin. Maybe  a higher concentration could work better to me, but I&#x27; not encouraged to try.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for more than 10 years. The vit C soaks into my skin easily and keeps my skin from becoming dry as I become older. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> it is very good product l love it  . very good product and the service is  good&lt;br /&gt;shipped within  1-2 days</li>
    <li> It seemed like the item was not as thick as it&#x27;s suppose to be.  Like if water was added to it.</li>
    <li> I first used the Obagi Pro-C 10% Serum, then went to the 15% when it ran out.  That way my skin was used to the product and I could bypass any initial irritation.  I use it in the morning under my makeup, for a smooth, shiny surface.  I will be 60 in July and my 40-year-old friends all tell me I have brighter, more even-toned and less wrinkled skin (especially around my eyes) than they do. I will continue to use this product in the years ahead.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for a few weeks, it was recommended (age over 50) by my skin care salon.  So far, I feel it is a good product and will continue to use it</li>
    <li> I was getting the original Pro C 15% serum which is a fairly thick amber color. The last two times I received a clear watery diluted serum. The Obagi website is trying to shut this intermediary site down as there have been many complaints. It is easy to tamper with this particular product. I would NOT ever order beauty products from this site again.</li>
    <li> I love the way it feels on my skin.  It seems to keep my skin soft and glowing.  The price seems to have sky rocketed, though.  Not sure if I&#x27;m going to continue to use this one or find a cheaper product.</li>
    <li> I read the other reviews and was hesitant to order it online rather than purchasing it from a plastic surgeon, but the product seems to be genuine and it is a great base for my other skin care products.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to say that it has &amp;#34;transformed&amp;#34; my skin, but I like it better than the other high end serums I have used (glytone, neocutis).</li>
    <li> This C-Serum is of excellent quality.</li>
    <li> Helps with the dark spots and feel nice, I use on neck and face.  Use at night and morning before sunblock.</li>
    <li> I Love this product!!! It brightens my face and works well with the Obaji Cleanser and C lotion. I get compliments on my face and the clearness of my skin.</li>
    <li> Great product for great price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years but have recently switched to lower cost Vitamin C products listed on Amazon, strictly due to the price. Also, I have increased the percentage to 20% for the face and use the standard 5% solution for around the eyes. I still pay for the Obagi 5% solution because at least it lasts long.  Since the 15% and 20% are for your entire face and neck, it goes quickly and the price is just too prohibitive. I see no difference between it and the less costlier Vitamin C Serums.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It made my husband notice my complexion and say how young I looked. This product is a little &amp;#34;stickier&amp;#34; than the 10% solution but still worth it&#x27;s weight in gold!</li>
    <li> I love love Obagi.  It&#x27;s done amazing things for my skin, I normally pay more money for it and was elated when I found the serum on Amazon. I would give this product 5 stars, but in the past my Obagi Serum has always has an expiration date on bottle.  I couldn&#x27;t find on on this particular one and it makes me concerned about the quality and the age of the product.  So be aware of that when you&#x27;re purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have been using the product for a few months it is definitely not the strength or the quality of previously used Obagi products.  Very disappointed.  Don&#x27;t purchase!</li>
    <li> Expensive, but does what it says it will do. Have been using it for years.  I am 71 years young and have a glowing complexion. It works!!!</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t Obagi Pro-C Serum. This is windex that smells like artificial oranges.. People like this should be in jail</li>
    <li> It really works on my mother&#x27;s skin. It gives her healthy look on her skin and less wrinkles. She&#x27;s always using this as part of her skin regimen.</li>
    <li> Love it and have been using it for 10 yrs I conjunction with the Obagi C-exfoliating day cream.  The very best!!</li>
    <li> Even though the product came in an Obagi box with Obagi label, the serum feels like a dilution and not the same as the original.  The bottle did not have a plastic seal on it.  It makes me think that it has been tampered with. When I bought the C serum from my dermatologist, the bottle has the plastic seal that you tear off prior to using it. I would not buy it from this source again because I am not sure what&#x27;s really in it.</li>
    <li> I have used this for about 2 months or so now 2x a day and have had some really great complements</li>
    <li> Expensive but perfect if you have acne, not severe, but it will reduce inflammation and redness. I have found that it revitalizes your skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a long time.  I always order this product through amazon. I received this item on time and I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I use a lot of different hi-end beauty products...Obagi makes good products.  My skin was a little sensitive to this serum....if you have fair or sensitive skin I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this in a doctor&#x27;s office before and there has always been an expiration date listed. This arrived with no expiration date and the product seemed watery.</li>
    <li> Obagi offers a great skin care line, aways great products.  Very reasonable pricing for Vitamin C serum. It is odorless.</li>
    <li> Purchased it with the Obagi Nu-Derm Exfoderm and the combination of both products has smoothed my skin, evened out the color and my skin looks radiant. A definite Buy again product.</li>
    <li> The serum arrived in a timely fashion and was new, as advertised.  Service and delivery was excellent.This is a product I&#x27;ve used for years and it&#x27;s kept my skin looking great!</li>
    <li> I have tried everything and was never completely satisfied until now. I LOVE this skin care line. Moisture without greasiness.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Obagi products for 2 1/2 yrs now and people are always commenting on what great skin I have.  It takes a few months for your skin to acclimate, but by the time you&#x27;re on the Vitamin C maintenance, your skin has already become accustomed to the skin care line; it lightens age spots, exfoliated skin and gives it a healthy glow.  I highly recommend this and the rest of the Obagi line.</li>
    <li> Perfect love product good price delivered quickly</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and truly like the effect it has on my skin.  I recommend it as part of your skin care routine.</li>
    <li> Love the Obagi Vit C serum.  Have been using for several years.  Keeps skin smooth and supple.  Highly recommend this product and the Vit C for eyes.</li>
    <li> I received itchy skin when I applied this.  When I stopped using this product the itchiness went away.  Guess I am alergic to it.</li>
    <li> A few drops does wonders!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy your vitamin c serum online- they are most likley expired and unstable. It does more harm than good when it&#x27;s bad. You will know if it has a yellow or orange tint to it that it has gone bad.</li>
    <li> I use Obagi after my plastic surgeon suggestion. I had a necklift and Obagi is suppose du help my &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; neck. I don&#x27;t know yet if it works, but I like the product. I am wondering why it is 10$ more expensive than last year. It was 28$ and now 40$. It is a big raise!</li>
