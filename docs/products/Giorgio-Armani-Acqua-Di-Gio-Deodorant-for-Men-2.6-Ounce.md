    <li> Scent is light and did not cause a skin rash.  Delivery was on schedule</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift for a friend who loves it and says it smells amazing.</li>
    <li> The top was busted open and the deodorant is melted. But it smells nice</li>
    <li> Although liked the scent of the deodorant, I noticed that it does not last long. Especially in outdoor activities, where it immediately evaporates, and the swept smell starts! I do not recommend it at all.</li>
    <li> GIO IS A GREAT PRODUCT THAT I USE EVERY DAY ALONG WITH THE AFTER SHAVE!&lt;br /&gt;I WISH THEY HAD A FACE AND BODY WASH!</li>

    <li> OK this is a little embarrassing but I always buy two of these - one for my husband and one for me. I borrowed his once when I ran out of mine, and the scent is very neutral and pleasant.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this deodorant and refuses to wear anything else.  It&#x27;s fresh, clean and very easy to use.  It stays true to the cologne scent.  Goes fast though.</li>
    <li> Very nice, and very good shipping.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> smells good but does not last long. I like the fact that it does not stain cloth.</li>
