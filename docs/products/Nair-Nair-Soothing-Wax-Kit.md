### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I have used plenty of hair removal products and I found that these work great!</li>
      <li>and they work great!!</li>
      <li>I am very happy with the product and the great customer service I got.</li>
      <li>LOL.</li>
      <li>I used to buy these all the time and was happy with them.</li>
      <li>-This is the best waxing product I&#x27;ve found that can be bought at a drug store, and I&#x27;ve tried many.     </li>
      <li>Which was surprising because they claimed to be wax hair removal strips.</li>
      <li>This brand is usually really good.</li>
      <li>I tried this product because it had good reviews with \\&quot;no</li>
      <li>and I loved them</li>
      <li>I had used it before and that was good</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how this product got good reviews.</li>
      <li>The veet waxing strips are too good ..</li>
      <li>I go out of my way to order these online and pay more because of the great results.</li>
      <li>Love them!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gotten is product before and have always liked.</li>
      <li>No matter how warm you get these strips they don&#x27;t pull off well.</li>
      <li>so they stay warm and are easier to work with.</li>
      <li>What I usually do is to warm up a heating pad and place the strips on the pad</li>
      <li>I was enthusiastic about these strips when I read the reviews</li>
      <li>Within the week, I got my full order!!</li>
      <li>Because, yeah, they won&#x27;t work unless they&#x27;re warm and peel apart easily.</li>
      <li>-It isn&#x27;t a sugar or honey wax, so it is meant for more course hair.</li>
      <li>Veet is way better.</li>
      <li>I bought some from Walgreens, but i use Amazon most of the time</li>
      <li>and it gets most of the hair out.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using these mostly for my underarms</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product &amp; seller to others :)</li>
      <li>I love these</li>
      <li>so I can work with them on more parts of my body.</li>
      <li>and I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE them.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if I got defected one or not</li>
      <li>I shudder to think how many kits you&#x27;d have to buy and</li>
      <li>i wasnt able to use it because it didnt serve its purpose.  </li>
      <li>&#x3D;)</li>
      <li>I was happy to find these on Amazon, but it seems like what I received was old or inferior product.</li>
      <li>how many times you&#x27;d have to re-wax each area to get as smooth as the girl on the package and then for it to be worth it</li>
      <li>I even made a midnight run to the 24hr walgreens after these didn&#x27;t work, because hell no was i going into work with more hair than i wanted in certain areas.</li>
      <li>And the large strips weren&#x27;t much better.</li>
      <li>Heed my warning and only get these if you can find a store that stocks them with a good return policy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using these for maybe 5 years now and have never had any major problems with them, I warm them against my thigh, which is warmer than my hands, for about 15 seconds</li>
      <li>tried again, using a heat source since I thought they might not have been warm enough, but it just encouraged the gel to STAY on my leg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am distressed, after seeing all the positive comments I hoped this would be great, but this product is not worth a dime.</li>
      <li>I should&#x27;ve checked them right after I got them.</li>
      <li>I usually use Sally Hansen waxing strips and they work great.</li>
      <li>The directions gave no indication as to how long you need to rub the strips between your hands to warm the wax</li>
      <li>hands might get a bit sticky, but overall the strips are much easier to clean up than microwavable wax that comes in a tub; and they work better.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recomend this product unless you have extremely sparse, fine leg hair and skin that never gets irritated (or if you have a lot of money and just love the feeling of your leg hair being pulled.)   </li>
      <li>At first I could not even get the strips to stick to my legs.</li>
      <li>This is the first time I get it from this seller</li>
      <li>I definitely do not recommend this product at all as i avoid Nair no matter how many sales i see for it now.</li>
      <li>I go and buy more from nair only this time I get the spa clay wax strips.</li>
      <li>&quot; so that was my first hint, since they&#x27;ve been around forever).</li>
      <li>On top of that, I tried it again, got it smoothed down against my leg, quickly pulled it off, -and</li>
      <li>(I warm the strips with my hairdryer on low for a few seconds instead of warming them with my hands, just to make sure).    </li>
      <li>The kit I bought was old and nothing I did to warm the wax even got it to the point where I could try to wax a single hair.</li>
      <li>and they are really great.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
      <li>not too much pain</li>
      <li>Absolutely ineffectual.</li>
      <li>I ordered these about a week ago and didn&#x27;t open them right off the bat, which was probably my first mistake.</li>
      <li>I HIGHLY recommend these strips.</li>
      <li>I used one, as instructed and pulled it off to realize that the strip had actually just absorbed the \\&quot;wax\\&quot;</li>
      <li>so I was kinda worried since this is someone new.</li>
      <li>The conclusion I&#x27;ve come to is that the vendor that stocks these must have some VERY old stock (the package said \\&quot;new\\</li>
      <li>Exact same problem.</li>
      <li>First let me say that I have used them for eyebrows, upper lips, and for the bikini line.</li>
      <li>The wax is dried up, even after you warm it up by rubbing between your palms for a long time (and though my palms are always warm), when you try to separate the 2 strips, the wax chips off and one strip gets all the dried wax and other strip doesn&#x27;t have any wax on it.</li>
      <li>Completely unusable.</li>
      <li>I assume that the product was old.  </li>
      <li>Well I read the reviews saying that the strips seem to be old or out of date or something.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>and I felt like I&#x27;d been completely ripped off.</li>
      <li>This works on shorter hair, removes more, and leaves me with less pain than any other method.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyway, I just tried this Nair Soothing Wax Kit, used the cooling wipes first as directed, warmed up the strips until they felt good and plyable, pulled it apart slowly, -and one half of the wax came completely off one side and stuck to the other!!  </li>
      <li>Complete and utter garbage!  </li>
      <li>The strips were so old that on each park of strips, the wax backing came off totally onto one of the strips so that neither of them worked.</li>
      <li>My guess is that the wax just doesn&#x27;t perform after it gets old enough.</li>
      <li>These work fantastic on thick, course hair, which I have.</li>

<li> strips are WAY too old and dried to be used - I even tried heating them in the microwave.</li>
<li> No Matter how long or hard to rub it between my palm, it didnt get soft but was still very solid.</li>
<li> The other reviews said the wax seemed old/dry, but that didn&#x27;t stop me because the ones I bought from the store was the same way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> (If you have extremely dense, course hair, you may need to wax an area twice, but when that hair grows back it won&#x27;t be as dense).      </li>
<li> Stores keep discontinuing them, which makes me very sad, because they are all I will use any more, and I have to search harder and harder for them.</li>
<li> no matter how carefully I pull the strips apart the\\&quot;wax\\&quot;pulls away from the strip in spots.</li>
<li> and I&#x27;m stuck with a big gob of green goo on my leg.  </li>
<li> I used to buy 2 boxes to do my legs every few months (especially during the summer)</li>
<li> it&#x27;s a total waste ) :</li>
<li> Finally I gave up on trying to rub them to death with my hands and microwaved one of them for a few seconds.</li>
<li> I put it on my leg carefully</li>
<li> , I&#x27;m certainly not buying them anymore.</li>
<li> When applied it only removes hair the first time, leaves hair behind and spots of \\&quot;wax&#x27; are left behind.</li>
<li> A couple of times when the store ran out I had to try other brands of wax strips</li>
<li> I was most disappointed.</li>
<li> The other day was my wedding anniversary and my husband and</li>
<li> ( I wound up having to rub each one for at least 30 seconds), didn&#x27;t get any where near all the hair (left about 40% of it behind), a few times the wax actually came off the strip and stuck to my leg removing no hair at all, even if it had worked (which it DID NOT)</li>
<li> I threw it away, not useful at all.</li>
<li> 2 thumbs down</li>
<li> Half stays all on one side.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> -This is the best waxing product I&#x27;ve found that can be bought at a drug store, and I&#x27;ve tried many.     -It isn&#x27;t a sugar or honey wax, so it is meant for more course hair. (If you have extremely dense, course hair, you may need to wax an area twice, but when that hair grows back it won&#x27;t be as dense).      -If you are planning on waxing your legs, buy two boxes or you might run out of product!    -The reviewers who say the strips don&#x27;t work at all, or say they are like scotch tape, must not be warming up the strips enough before use. Because, yeah, they won&#x27;t work unless they&#x27;re warm and peel apart easily. (I warm the strips with my hairdryer on low for a few seconds instead of warming them with my hands, just to make sure).    -Your hands might get a bit sticky, but overall the strips are much easier to clean up than microwavable wax that comes in a tub; and they work better.</li>
    <li> no matter how carefully I pull the strips apart the\\&quot;wax\\&quot;pulls away from the strip in spots. When applied it only removes hair the first time, leaves hair behind and spots of \\&quot;wax&#x27; are left behind. I have used similar products for over 10 years and have never had this bad if a result. I tried this product because it had good reviews with \\&quot;no mess\\&quot; but since it won&#x27;t do the job, it is worthless.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recomend this product unless you have extremely sparse, fine leg hair and skin that never gets irritated (or if you have a lot of money and just love the feeling of your leg hair being pulled.)   The directions gave no indication as to how long you need to rub the strips between your hands to warm the wax ( I wound up having to rub each one for at least 30 seconds), didn&#x27;t get any where near all the hair (left about 40% of it behind), a few times the wax actually came off the strip and stuck to my leg removing no hair at all, even if it had worked (which it DID NOT) I would have needed at least twice the strips provided. I shudder to think how many kits you&#x27;d have to buy and how many times you&#x27;d have to re-wax each area to get as smooth as the girl on the package and then for it to be worth it the smoothness would have to last long enough for all the irritation to go away.</li>
    <li> Target used to carry these and I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE them. I used to buy 2 boxes to do my legs every few months (especially during the summer) These work fantastic on thick, course hair, which I have. A couple of times when the store ran out I had to try other brands of wax strips and they were all just HORRIBLE and didn&#x27;t work at all! I&#x27;ve been using these for maybe 5 years now and have never had any major problems with them, I warm them against my thigh, which is warmer than my hands, for about 15 seconds and I never get pieces of wax left behind on my legs or problems pulling them apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the sad part, Target just doesn&#x27;t carry these any more, I suspect Nair isn&#x27;t making them anymore or something. So after a while I got desperate and ordered these online and was SO disappointed because they worked just like the inferior brands I&#x27;ve tried before! The wax stuck to my legs and no hair was removed, and the wax strips were difficult to separate. The conclusion I&#x27;ve come to is that the vendor that stocks these must have some VERY old stock (the package said \\&quot;new\\&quot; so that was my first hint, since they&#x27;ve been around forever). My guess is that the wax just doesn&#x27;t perform after it gets old enough. Heed my warning and only get these if you can find a store that stocks them with a good return policy. If the wax comes off all over your legs, return them as a defective product! I wouldn&#x27;t risk buying them online, I&#x27;m certainly not buying them anymore. I now have my sights set on in-home laser hair removal, no more wax for me!</li>
    <li> I ordered these about a week ago and didn&#x27;t open them right off the bat, which was probably my first mistake. I should&#x27;ve checked them right after I got them. The other day was my wedding anniversary and my husband and I were going to go out, and I got the notion to use them. I opened the package and the medium strips were just completely dried out, like they&#x27;d been sitting on a shelf for YEARS. Completely unusable. And the large strips weren&#x27;t much better. It was all cracked and dried out. It upset me and I felt like I&#x27;d been completely ripped off. This brand is usually really good. I&#x27;ve bought the same stuff from Walgreens and I loved them but this product from this seller was just terrible.</li>
    <li> Ineffectual product. Veet is way better.</li>
    <li> I have used this product in the past and found it easier to use than other wax strip kits.  The the kit I purchased online, however, was not satisfactory.  The wax comes off in clumps and does not remove the hair as designed.  I assume that the product was old.  I was most disappointed.</li>
    <li> These require a little experimentation to master, but I can&#x27;t find another product that comes even close. This works on shorter hair, removes more, and leaves me with less pain than any other method. Stores keep discontinuing them, which makes me very sad, because they are all I will use any more, and I have to search harder and harder for them. Amazon, please stock these!</li>
    <li> i wasnt able to use it because it didnt serve its purpose.  The wax was stale.  I threw it away, not useful at all.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work at all.  It should be zero star but I was not able to do so.  No Matter how long or hard to rub it between my palm, it didnt get soft but was still very solid. I wasn&#x27;t sure if I got defected one or not but  It was waste of money and time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these prewaxed strips for about 3 years now. First let me say that I have used them for eyebrows, upper lips, and for the bikini line. I am only on my second package in 3 years. I HIGHLY recommend these strips. What I usually do is to warm up a heating pad and place the strips on the pad so they stay warm and are easier to work with. I also tend to cut them into smaller pieces so I can work with them on more parts of my body. Give it a try if you are sick of paying $15+ for eyebrow waxes!</li>
    <li> I bought this and i am pissed off.. it is pathetic..The veet waxing strips are too good .. i repent not buying them..pls dont waste your money ..go for the veet waxing strips</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotten is product before and have always liked. This is the first time I get it from this seller so I was kinda worried since this is someone new. I did get my product on time but I did get all of my order...I had order 2 of the waxing strips. I e-mailed the seller through Amazon the next day &amp; within 24 hours I got a reply with apologies and with a promise to have it fix. Within the week, I got my full order!! I am very happy with the product and the great customer service I got. I would recommend this product &amp; seller to others :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these mostly for my underarms and they work great!! not too much pain and it gets most of the hair out.  Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t find them at the stores sometimes.</li>
    <li> I used to buy these from Walmart, but they stopped carrying them so I thought I&#x27;d try to find them online. The other reviews said the wax seemed old/dry, but that didn&#x27;t stop me because the ones I bought from the store was the same way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least that&#x27;s what I thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These strips are WAY too old and dried to be used - I even tried heating them in the microwave. No dice. Save your money and just accept that Nair isn&#x27;t making them anymore. It sucks, I know.</li>
    <li> I used to buy these all the time and was happy with them. They haven&#x27;t been stocked at Target for several months, so I thought they just stopped carrying them. I was happy to find these on Amazon, but it seems like what I received was old or inferior product. The wax just stuck to by skin in a big patch and didn&#x27;t stay on the strip. Totally worthless and now in the trash. Try the Sally Hansen version, they are a similar replacement.</li>
    <li> I have used plenty of hair removal products and I found that these work great! I use a blow dryer to heat them, since it takes too long rubbing with hands. I love these and I was so disappointed to find them discontinued in stores. I go out of my way to order these online and pay more because of the great results. I have used almost every Sally Hansen wax, and none of them are even comparable to these Nair strips. Love them!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think amazon should even sell this product from this vendor. The strips were so old that on each park of strips, the wax backing came off totally onto one of the strips so that neither of them worked. After trying three, I threw the lt away. Absolutely ineffectual.</li>
    <li> Men...do not use it. I tried it and it hurts like the hell! I was bleeding. The wax was still on my leg. The way to use it is retarded. Just...just dont do it!</li>
    <li> I was enthusiastic about these strips when I read the reviews but.. they&#x27;re just AWFUL!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No hair was removed at ALL, but you still got the pain.&lt;br /&gt;Then the blue gel on the strips began to come OFF the strips and stuck to my leg, forcing me to pull the gel out painfully.&lt;br /&gt;I tried again, using a heat source since I thought they might not have been warm enough, but it just encouraged the gel to STAY on my leg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am distressed, after seeing all the positive comments I hoped this would be great, but this product is not worth a dime.</li>
    <li> It was dried up when it arrived</li>
    <li> I had the same bad luck as everyone else. The kit I bought was old and nothing I did to warm the wax even got it to the point where I could try to wax a single hair. Whatever is &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; and left out there is likely the same. Don&#x27;t bother</li>
    <li> WORST PRODUCT EVER. I read and reread the directions and followed them thoroughly. At first I could not even get the strips to stick to my legs. It was equivalent to waxing with paper. Finally I gave up on trying to rub them to death with my hands and microwaved one of them for a few seconds. I put it on my leg carefully and once I peeled it off the wax stuck to my leg and is still there as I am writing this. I don&#x27;t know how this product got good reviews. What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> DO NOT buy this product, it&#x27;s a complete waste of money. The wax is dried up, even after you warm it up by rubbing between your palms for a long time (and though my palms are always warm), when you try to separate the 2 strips, the wax chips off and one strip gets all the dried wax and other strip doesn&#x27;t have any wax on it. I can not even return it because the seller says they don&#x27;t accept opened personal care items, but I don&#x27;t understand without opening how would I know about the problem.</li>
    <li> I usually use Sally Hansen waxing strips and they work great. My pharmacy was out so I tried nair. No matter how warm you get these strips they don&#x27;t pull off well. Half stays all on one side. It almost seems like its expired and it dried up. Sooooo  maybe it was past its shelf life. I go and buy more from nair only this time I get the spa clay wax strips. They suck too! Exact same problem. I would give this zero stars if I could. At 11$ a box it&#x27;s a total waste ) :</li>
    <li> Well I read the reviews saying that the strips seem to be old or out of date or something.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had believed them!&lt;br /&gt;The strips are so hard and even though I used my hair dryer to soften them and use them,&lt;br /&gt;they didn&#x27;t remove EVEN one hair !!&lt;br /&gt;This is weird because I have used Nair wax strips before and they are really great.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, DON&#x27;T buy this Item!</li>
    <li> I only bought these because it so closely resembled a product I cannot find anymore, that I knew worked well.  And that was Veet waxing strips.  I can&#x27;t find them anywhere!  I even tried to order them online once, and I never recieved the package.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I just tried this Nair Soothing Wax Kit, used the cooling wipes first as directed, warmed up the strips until they felt good and plyable, pulled it apart slowly, -and one half of the wax came completely off one side and stuck to the other!!  Garbage.  On top of that, I tried it again, got it smoothed down against my leg, quickly pulled it off, -and all the wax came off the friggin paper and stuck to my leg!  Complete and utter garbage!  No hair removal whatsoever, and I&#x27;m stuck with a big gob of green goo on my leg.  I may as well try to wax my legs with Laffy Taffy!  Do not buy this garbage!!</li>
    <li> It was hard and broke when I tried to use it</li>
    <li> These are the WORST wax strips i have ever used. I bought some from Walgreens, but i use Amazon most of the time so i just HAD to write a review. I used one, as instructed and pulled it off to realize that the strip had actually just absorbed the \\&quot;wax\\&quot; and so i felt like i was just pulling a cloth that was on my skin off. It didn&#x27;t take anything off. So of course i thought \\&quot;Oh, I must have done it wrong\\&quot; so i tried it again, same result. I gave up after using 6 strips with NO RESULTS at all. Which was surprising because they claimed to be wax hair removal strips. I have used bad, that are not great but at least they take SOMETHING off. This takes N.O.T.H.I.N.G. I don&#x27;t know why i even bought Nair, i don&#x27;t like them, i have had experiences with them before with bad results stemming from their products. E.G. \\&quot;Painless\\&quot; hair removal couldn&#x27;t feel more painful or just as painful as other wax products. I definitely do not recommend this product at all as i avoid Nair no matter how many sales i see for it now. LOL. I even made a midnight run to the 24hr walgreens after these didn&#x27;t work, because hell no was i going into work with more hair than i wanted in certain areas. So chalking this up to a bad experience, waste of money, waste of time and an overall AVOID sticker all over their products. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Tried it numerous times and still it did not work. Nothing comes off on the strip. Just was not pleased with the product</li>
    <li> The wax was so dry and couldn&#x27;t be used and when I message the seller about this no one ever got back to me. 2 thumbs down</li>
    <li> this product is garbage! I had used it before and that was good but this one didnt even work for one hair! dont waste your money</li>
