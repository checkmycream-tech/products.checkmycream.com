<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this thinking that it would be a great natural mineral and perfume free alternative to the dabur amla oil but um.....it smells exactly the same, same consistency, color, and cause the same build up in my hair. I compared them side by side. Im so pissed because I paid 7.99 for a bottle 5x the size of this one at the local indian store and threw it away ...no I have to throw this away too because the product is not what it claims to be. DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT IF U WANT A PRODUCT THAT IS PARFUME AND MINERAIL OIL FREE.</li>
    <li> It seems to work I am seeing some thickening at the temples it is not really that oily either is seems to absorb quickly...</li>
    <li> Softened my natural  hair and made it easy to comb through...has a mild fragrance...my hair is healthier!</li>
    <li> So far the texture/sheen of my hair looks great after using this as a treatment. But man, the reviewers who talk about this smelling like old lady perfume are not exaggerating, and the scent does not easily wash out. I&#x27;ve taken to mixing it with black castor oil and emu oil and then applying as an overnight treatment to try and alleviate some of the old lady smell. Thankfully, my partner just said &amp;#34;hmm, you smell like soap.&amp;#34; Maybe I need to switch soaps. But back to the hair oil -- I am seeing a mild decrease in hairfall, but it hasn&#x27;t been very long. But even in this short time, I&#x27;ve seen a huge boost in the shine of my hair. It looks healthy, even in winter. If I notice long-term effects, I&#x27;ll be sure to update the review.</li>
    <li> wow the shipping was fast and i love the smell of the product  waiting for the 1st month and see  if it grows my hair</li>
    <li> Hair fall reduced considerably..&lt;br /&gt;ofcourse having a proper diet is necessary.&lt;br /&gt;But this oil does strengthen hair roots..&lt;br /&gt;I am waiting if it help gaining back lost hairs..</li>
    <li> I purchased this item from All India Store and service was FAST! They shipped overnight! I love buying from them because of their service and the high quality products.  I used this item just once now and all I can say is WOW! It is not an overwhelming smell like the Amla oil but kind of sweet smelling oil. It dissipates after a few minutes though. It made my hair so soft and smooth and the shine is to die for! It has the consistency of coconut oil, which I love so much. I massaged it in my scalp and amazingly it did not weigh my hair down! This will become one of my staples in hair care!</li>
    <li> Good but Expensive coz its a small bottle</li>
    <li> I have been using this on my ahir and scalp every other night and I have definitely noticed a difference in the falling of my hair,  no longer see it in the shower and my hair dresser commented on the new growth</li>
    <li> this product i am using from last 5 years and when i came to america i thought i will miss it and wat will happen to my hair but all india store i heartly appreciate you for making it available and i suggest everybody to use it regularly because the herb use in it are compltely natural and trully nutritious to hair and scalp..its immpossible to get this kind of product in whole world so go for it without any single worry..jus give your hair natural breath to survive..!!!</li>
    <li> This is very good product if you are having any hair loss issues. I would recommend it to people having any problems of hair loss and grey hair to use and see the difference. Shipping is fast, so rest assured for great deal.</li>
    <li> I purchased this per its claim of stopping hair loss. I also have this weird condition where the palms of my hands begin itching uncontrollably, until bright red. Very strange and very annoying. I usually stick my hands in ice water, let them cool down, and hope the episode is over. Well, about 10 days ago I began this \\&quot;palm itching ritual\\&quot; and instead of ice water, out of sincere desperation, I applied 2 drops of this oil on my palms and rubbed them together, and the itch stopped INSTANTLY. I mean, instantly. It has been 10 days and no more (so far) itching palms. This is a fantastic product that had performed very well, where even the best of our doctors could not. Just bought 2 more bottles for reserve. I also must add that this seller was fantastic to deal with. 1/1/2012 -  Adding to this review: After using this for some 3 weeks, it does indeed darken the hair color. If you have white hair, this oil will darken it. Reconsider if you don&#x27;t like your hair getting dark.</li>
    <li> I purchased this from a neighborhood Indian grocery store for $4.99. He only had 2 bottles. I bought the one &amp; fell in love with the way it made my hair feel. I have had minimum shedding &amp; went back to the store and purchased the 2nd bottle. I have since used this product every week mixed with some peppermint essential oils as a hot oil treatment as a pre-treatment. The owner was nice enough to order more, so they are fully stocked now for you Houstonians that would like to try it!</li>
    <li> I have very curly thick 4c hair and it can be extremely dry at times. This oil works well with a creamy water based moisturizer (Cantu Shea Butter coconut curling cream) underneath it. Alone it made my hair hard and unmanageable. I also use it when i deep condition.  My hair is much more softer and my curls pop! The smell isnt bad (i actually like it) and it goes away quickly. This oil has helped my hair retain moisture thru out the cold Chicago winter and i find myself not having to reapply this product everyday or even every other day (a lil goes a long way). I have seen some minimal growth and less breakage. Shipping was quick too!</li>
    <li> Best Thing I ever discovered!!! Ok I order this for my sister who recently cut off all her hair to go natural she never really had long hair. So in 3 1/2 month now she has a mini afro. This stuff works really fast. I also used on my daughter her who is 5 years old. She cut a piece of her in  the center abt 2 weeks ago and I recently used it on her this on her hair last Sunday and now there is already hair in that area. This God Sent. Glad I discover this.</li>
    <li> I am someone who has dealt with alopecia areata for years.  My reflexologist recommended this and in a short period of time, I have had tremendous hair regrowth in my bald patches.  I apply every other day at bedtime and it rinses right out in the morning without leaving an oily residue.  It actually gives my hair a nice sheen.  It is a natural and effective treatment. I believe it has also made my hair grow in general at a faster rate.  I am paying it forward.  Try this and I hope you will be as grateful as I am.  I would shout it from the rooftops if I could.  Nothing has been more effective for me.  For anyone with alopecia, I recommend this oil, acupuncture and reflexology.  Lots of luck.</li>
    <li> I purchase this product a week ago and can already see the Amazing difference in my hair. I&#x27;m a product junkie and if is states it will make your hair grow and its all natural then I&#x27;m sold. But everything I buy doesn&#x27;t work, but this does. It is truly Amazing I was so empress that I ordered a second bottle today. Amazing...</li>
    <li> Extremely fast delivery! I am excited to give this product a try for the first time, if I get good results I will order again in the future.</li>
    <li> I really like the way it softens my hair, and help keep it moisturized. I have 4C natural hair and I use it as a (pre-poo), just before I shampoo my hair. Its definitely not an oil to keep in. It has to be washed out. The smell is not so good.  My husband says it stinks, but he doesnt even like pepermint oil! But I have to agree with him on this one.  Overall I love what it does for my hair and would purchase again.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m going to go out on a limb here, and sing praises of this product, after only ONE use. I swear my hair already feels stronger, as in, if I gather it all up and tug, it feels firmly rooted. A little over a month ago, I had my whole head bleached in order to produce a more vivid funky color, done at a salon. My hair wasn&#x27;t fried, but I&#x27;ve had quite a bit of breakage, and I&#x27;m always dealing with hair fall in addition to some dandruff. Again, after just one use, I have noticed A LOT less breakage, and almost NO fall! And dandruff, what dandruff? This is a miraculous product, in my humble opinion. If I remember to, I&#x27;ll post an update in another month&#x27;s time, as far as growth, and new growth (which my scalp could definitely benefit from). The smell is a little overpowering, but I found that to be only from the bottle. I guess I got used to it while I let it sit, after I hung my head upside down and massaged it in, in circular motions like how they advise. Next time I use it, I just may leave it in overnight. I could still smell traces of it the day after I shampooed it out, but that was pleasant. LOVE THIS!!</li>
    <li> Everyone has a different experience with products. Quite frankly, for me, the oil did not live up to it&#x27;s claim. I have thick, wavy dark hair. I&#x27;ve used it for 2 weeks, roughly 4 times and with each application, I lost an incredible amount of hair. Also, I&#x27;m a bit doubtful that the product has listed all it&#x27;s ingredients. I wouldn&#x27;t sideline that it probably has mineral oil in it. Leaving on overnight and combing it the next day resulted is more hair loss than normal for me. When I wash my hair, I&#x27;m gentle with massaging and lathering my shampoo to avoid excessive hair loss. With this oil, I lost a lot of hair even during my washes. I&#x27;m not satisfied with the result, price I paid and the amount of time it takes for delivery.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use for hair loss. I think it helped some, but ultimately, I turned to another product.</li>
    <li> I guess for me, it is too much for my scalp.  I can&#x27;t use it but I hear it is great for some.  What can you do?</li>
    <li> It has all natural and essential oil required for healthy hair. Initially I was concerned about its strong perfume smell and was not sure if its good for hair. Later I got to know that its probably due to Arnica flower which is very good for hair treatment. So I will treat all the good reviews posted by others and will apply this hair oil regularly. Hoping for better results.</li>
    <li> I discovered  this product on my Ayurveda site and read how it can help your hair grow and help with hair loss. I have been using it with the Bhringraj caps for about 6 months. I take the caps twice daily and put the Mahabhringaraj oil on my scalp/hair every other night (sleep with it in). My hair started to show a difference after the first use. It was shinny, had more body and just looked heather. But the surprise was 3 months later when I could see the new growth and my hair dresser saw the new hair all over my head. Second great results is that with coloring your hair you will have roots showing after 5 weeks. My roots have started to change to my natural hair color. Very little gray is left showing. I am averaging almost 1 inch of growth in 5 weeks. My hair dresser measured it last visit to be able to tell other customers that have been suffering with hair loss.</li>
    <li> Twice in a week, I apply it to my scalp and massage head for some time and leave it overnight and wash the hair with IHT9 shampoo next day morning. Now it almost stopped may hair fall , and looks hair healthier.  Apart from this I take spoon of bhringraj powder in cup of vegetable juice. these all combination worked well.</li>
    <li> This oil have many uses. I use it to help me sleep. I mix it with other carrier oils and use it for my hair. My hair is soft, strong, and healthy.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my occasional dandruff. I start having this problem right after I visit my friend&#x27;s house where they have a dog and cats. I use ACV + HP + Borax + Baking soda or Castile + lavender + Tea tree as well. Since I do oil treatment for hair, I wanted the oil to do both; kill whatever I get from animals at friend&#x27;s house as well as shiny healthy growth treatment. This oil does work for the latter purpose, but not the dandruff as they also claim to be.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is thick (I&#x27;m not Indian but hair amount and thickness are like an Indian lady) so I can&#x27;t tell if it stops falling hair or not. What I can tell is my long long hair looks shinier/healthier from roots to the end. So, there are some use but not my purpose of use ... If anyone looks for natural treatment to stop dandruff as well as other benefits all together- purpose oil, this is not just it.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t get passed the smell of it even after I washed it out. The smell just keep lingering! ugh</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for months now, after suffering from hair loss due to stress and side effects from birthcontrol pills. I make a hair mask using brahmi, amla, and neem powder and mix it with this oil. My hair was shoulder length in November of 2014 (this was when I first started using it) and now my hair is longer then the middle of my back and it&#x27;s only the middle of February!!! The only negative thing about this product is its INTENSE FLORAL SCENT. It&#x27;s so strong that my hair will smell like it for days even after washing. So it can be overwhelming for someone with a sensitive nose. Other then that this product is a miracle worker! Not only has my hair grown like a weed but it&#x27;s shinier thicker and stronger! I can&#x27;t even tell U how many compliments I have recieved by close friends and family who have known me when my hair was at its thinnest. This product is a definite MUST HAVE</li>
    <li> I have had issues with my hair and scalp including dry eczema, specially in winter i used to get dry scabs looking as if patches of skin was peeling off of my head/scalp. All these have GONE AWAY once I started massaging the oil to my head. Some hairs have turned back from grey to black, in all it feels my head is getting much needed nutrition after a long time!, thanks MahaBhringraj oil. Great Product.</li>
    <li> my hair grew alot after using this product ,  It is really good stuff i dont use anything else now.</li>
    <li> I am using this product for 3 weeks and i can definitely say it is making my hair soft.It has reduced my hair fall.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure about hair growth though. Think it is too early to tell that.&lt;br /&gt;Smell is not that bad,I actually kind of like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall , i will be buying this again and will be suggesting to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> This deep green oil really works. Yes, the smell is strong, but it does not bother me, because I have enough patience and experience to see the light at the end of the tunnel.  I would rather use this product (nature-made) as opposed to the lab-grown chemicals that most people swear by.  There are no side-effects except healthy hair and a fertile scalp.  My hair is genetically long (has been mid-back for years), but I use this product to preserve my hair for as long as I can.  And, it has grown to my waist in two-months&#x27; time.  I would highly recommend this oil.</li>
    <li> the smell is extremely strong but it makes my hair soft. i would not buy this item again because of the strong odor.</li>
    <li> I use this product for few weeks now and it looks like its helping with dandruff. The medication from dermatologist didn&#x27;t help. So I tried this one. Recommend if you need something from dandruff.</li>
    <li> I read that you can use this for problem, allergic doggies with bad skin and you can. he loves this stuff. it makes him so soft and shiny and his hair does grow faster. we can&#x27;t use it as much as we would like cause of the smell. makes me feel bad cause he&#x27;ll go to get combed and want this oil but if daddies around I have to tell him no:( it almost feels like torture they way he reacts to not getting oil when he asks for it.  I give him a little massage when I apply the oil as well.</li>
    <li> Alright so I bought this oil awhile ago however the smell deterred me from using it. The smell is rather strong and I had to get use to it and acclimate to the overwhelming sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow i am a big believer in not wasting purchases so I have been using this product every other day. I am using the oil just to get rid of it and not hate myself for wasting money. I wash my hair every other day and I incorporated this product into my usual routine. I massage the oil into my scalp at least an hour before i wash my hair. Sometimes I leave it in over night-like once every month. The smell is very distinct and sometimes I smell it after I shower because it is very hard to wash off. In fact I wash my hair two times in order to get rid of the smell.The smell isn&#x27;t that bad but if you want me to describe it I would say it is medicinal, distinct, and smells like an old ladies perfume that&#x27;s expired- just being honest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So lets get to the good part. The oil itself, is awesome, sometimes i leave it in overnight and my hair feels so soft, crazy soft. my hair is so much thicker, healthier, and overall it feels like I just left a spa where they concentrated on my hair. I recommend the oil if you aren&#x27;t sensitive to strong smells. I am sensitive to strong smells however I think the overall benefits surpass the uncomfortable smell. The oil definitely surpassed my expectations and I think it will surpass yours!</li>
    <li> So I just received my bottle and have some of it mixed with a few other oils and the smell is still strong.  I&#x27;m never really bothered my smells but this is the first time that a smell from a hair product has bothered me so much that I needed to write about it.  It is sort of a sickening sweet smell but I&#x27;m not going to give up on it just yet which is why I rated 5 stars so as not to mess up the rating success for this product so far.  So I will do an update in a month or two and adjust my rating accordingly but for now I will just have to wrap my scarf around my a little tighter.  By the way I am AA w/natural 4 a/b hair...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;I had to stop using this product, the smell was so overwhelming for me I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore so I only used it for about 2 weeks and then stopped...</li>
    <li> An excellent hair oil for massaging the scalp with. It has helped a lot with my scalp psoriasis and occasional scalp acne. I rub the oil into my scalp at night and wash my hair the next day. It smells herbal.</li>
    <li> I got this because of the benefits of bhringraj and because this had very good reviews.  Granted, I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see if there are any benefits, but holy mackerel, this stuff REEKS.  When I first opened the bottle, it wasn&#x27;t so bad.  Sort of like a cheap 1970s herbal smell.  I was sure I could handle it.  But after applying to my hair, putting on a plastic cap and wrapping my hair in a towel overnight, the fragrance got to be sickening and overwhelming.  I went to bed smelling like a little old lady, and woke up smelling like an old man.  To say it&#x27;s cloying is being nice.  It&#x27;s just dreadful and I got to where I dreaded doing the application because I hated the smell so much.  And trying to wash the smell out?  Forget about it.  It lingered in my hair for a few subsequent washings. It&#x27;s got good things in it, to be sure.  But I may either find another brand or make my own bhringraj oil.</li>
    <li> I love the way this work&#x27;s.  Smells amazing and different.  I can&#x27;t really describe the smell maybe like strong flowers but not unpleasant.  The smell last for days. My hair has grown about an inch and a half in less than two months.  It leaves my hair soft. I like !</li>
    <li> This product got here in about 2 days. From India to South Florida in Record time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product itself, it stinks but it&#x27;s so worth it. It has a myriad of effects but of course I&#x27;m using it to regrow my hair in thinning spots. It&#x27;s been about a month now and spots where I was damn near bald are starting to regrow hair. My only concern, as it stands with a lot of people,with this product is that there might be mineral oil in it. I even use this product for the patches on my beard, which are now filling in. It&#x27;s truly excellent... I wish it didn&#x27;t stink so much but I&#x27;ll take what I can get. It&#x27;s truly a must have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to add I use this product in conjunction with NOW foods Biotin 5000mcg veggie caps.. which I also purchase on amazon. I&#x27;m going for an inner and outer approach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope everyone considering this products enjoys the results as much as I have.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in between rating this product I had got it thought it was going help make my hair grow and help with dandruff, but all this product so is make my head itch really bad. Others may have different results cause we are not the same but to me this product wasn&#x27;t good at all so I went to another product.</li>
    <li> I love it and my hair loves it too.&lt;br /&gt;But I can&#x27;t leave it on my hair all night cuz the smell is really strong and I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells specialy when I sleep.</li>
    <li> Sometimes when I am stressed, I have this nervous tick where I would scratch the left side of my nape.  Overtime that area has become dry, brittle and actually itchy.  It seems like I caught a case of a fungal scalp, not cool.  And on top of that, my hair is shedding like a sick cat, which reduced the volume of hair noticeably.  For the record, I have very dry, kinky curly hair that is porous that can be brittle.  And also fine, despite its (former) thickness I have.  Well that is not the case anymore.  When I use this as an overnight treatment, it definitely slows down the shedding and my scalp does not itch anymore.  Plus that nape is slowly improving.  I use this once a week because washing my hair and scalp is a chore and my hair doesn&#x27;t get oily unless I use too much oil.  What I like about this oil is that there is a cooling/soothing sensation that calms my nerves.  The price is a bit high for the small bottle but in my opinion it is better than some of the other Indian oils I have tried that cost the same but comes in bigger bottles.  The smell is pervasive, like bergamont and curry, but thankfully it washes out.  I cannot speak on it for hair growth because I read that hair growth is something you must address internally like eating the right foods and getting plenty of water and exercise.  Also the results I have gotten has taken some time so do not expect overnight results.</li>
    <li> my god the smell is potent! it def reduces hair fall. another great product from india! all natural ingredients! im hoping it will make hairs BLACK</li>
    <li> Great product!! I noticed less shedding in as little as three weeks. The smell may be a bit overbearing for some, but I really like it (I am a strange individual and I like unique smells lol). Seriously, this oil is really good for your hair. I must say that I haven&#x27;t noticed any growth just yet. However, the reduction in shedding makes me very happy. It seems to good to be true. The oil also makes my hair really soft and manageable. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. For all of the naturalistas out there, my hair is 4B-ish / 4C-ish....</li>
    <li> I bought this product with high hopes. Last night I massaged it into my hair, giving myself about a 1/2 massage, then put a plastic shower cap over my head and wrapped my head with a towel and went to bed. I noticed that some of the oil was seeping out onto my pillow, even with the towel wrapped over my head, so I additionally had to put another towel over the pillow to protect. Per the product directions I left on over night and then washed out the next day. Once I rinsed the product out I did notice that my hair was extremely soft and moisturized. Another benefit to this product is that it gives you a tingly feeling on your scalp, so hopefully this will aid in blood flow to the scalp. However it is too early to tell. My hair sheds a lot and I was hoping that in the shower I would not notice that much hair, but their still was a great deal of hair on my come when I combed through my conditioner. But then again I haven&#x27;t combed my hair in two days due to illness, so perhaps this is the normal amount of hair you are supposed to lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product has a menthol smell to it, so if you are sensitive to smells and get migrains then this is not the product for you. However, if you have a cold and apply stuff like Vix on your chest to breathe then this will clear your sinuses right up!!!! I do have to admit that last night sleeping with that shower cap on my head was so uncomfortable; I also put some cotton balls in my ears so the oil would not seep in there. I don&#x27;t know how people survived in the 80&#x27;s with Jheri Curls lol. I digress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe my expectations for this product were too high. I think I was expecting a miracle. My edges are very thin and the crown of my head is thin, too. I also have all around diffuse thinning on my scalp. My hopes are that this product will aid in stopping the hair shedding, breakage and grow back the noticably thin areas. I give this product an A+ for a great massage. It feels soooo good. When I massage with castor oil it doesn&#x27;t give that tingly feeling but with this I can feel it working. The fact that it is green is annoying but hey you do what you got to do. This definately is not something that you want to use for a daily hair massage. I would use it as a once weekly pre-poo treatment. I will write back in a few months to update my status. So for A+ for great massage and soft hair.</li>
    <li> Scent is a little strong, but I love it! can&#x27;t wait to see results, my hair sheds too much for me, so I&#x27;ve been massaging my scalp at least 3 times a week faithfully.</li>
    <li> I really dont have anything great or extremely bad to say about tihs product. Its just &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; for me. I also HATE that GOD awful smell...but it seems okay, I mean it does what it says it does is which oil the hair, I havent notice any hair growth that I can contribute to this product alone.  I use this product in my own homemade concotion for my hair.  I will not order this product again.</li>
    <li> I will give a five star to this oil. The week I used I noticed differences in my hair. I had less hair fall and fast grow. Though now it&#x27;s been five weeks so far I have new hair but hair fall seemed not much improved at the end. But this oil surely does its job in hair growth. It also makes hair smooth; at least does for me. I don&#x27;t wanna now run out of it:)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a hair oil that would make my hair grow AND make it healthier. I&#x27;ve been on an Indian beauty product kick, so I thought I&#x27;d try this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it just about two weeks now and have used it four times. Two of those times, I left it on all night as directed. The other two, I left it on about four hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within two weeks, my hair has already started growing. I swear, it&#x27;s longer and feels thicker. I&#x27;ve verified that I&#x27;m not just imagining these results with other people. This is a potent and powerful product for hair growth, and I intend on purchasing another bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I&#x27;ve said, I&#x27;m only two weeks in but I&#x27;ve not noticed any darkening of my hair whatsoever. I have noticed less dandruff and buildup. I never really had a problem with hair loss, so I&#x27;ve not noticed anything in that area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I have to say is that the smell is definitely not the most pleasant. It&#x27;s not horrible and sometimes, I actually like it... But it&#x27;s so strong that it can be smothering. It gives my sister a massive headache and she refuses to be around me when I&#x27;m using it, but that&#x27;s a small price to pay for longer hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always used olive and castor oil on my hair, so I&#x27;ve been mixing those with this to make a really effective potion.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to try it yet because my sinus been acting up its thick castro oil i can&#x27;t wait to use it</li>
    <li> I purchased this for hair growth after a botched bleach job left my long gorgeous locks FRIED and I had a new chin length bob! It has worked so incredibly well, my hair is growing so fast people in my life are starting to ask what my secret is. I am at about 1\\&quot; a month in growth. It leaves my hair exceptionally soft and has helped with damaged areas. The smell is \\&quot;meh\\&quot; but really not bad....if you delve into herbal remedies at all, its prob nothing that would bother you. I use about a dime size amount, people if you are dripping you are using too much! Just work it through. I do wrap a silk scarf turban style to sleep for neatness when using this. I use a few times a week, 2-3 and have noticed that fantastically it helps me sleep gooooood! It is noted that this is common, and wow does it ever! I have a ton of energy, anxiety and lots of trouble catching my zzz&#x27;s, but this gives me peaceful rest. Love love love. As an FYI, 35 F , dark blonde fragile hair that is dyed very light blonde</li>
    <li> This stuff really works for shedding hair. Seriously! NOTHING ELSE has worked for me, I was panicking because I was worried I would end up with bald spots on my wedding day next month because the shedding would just NOT stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now there are some annoying aspects to this oil, the fact that it smells. Not awful, but like very strong cheap perfume (even though it does not say there is perfume in the ingredients...) AND you have to use it religiously. I have to use it every three days, the night before I wash. That means that my poor fiance has to put up with the smell a few nights a week, though he is good and doesn&#x27;t complain much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes my hair so nice and silky, and after the first week I had such a huge reduction in shed hair. I really have to be careful to use it consistently and never miss an oiling. Though I think after I run out of this one I might try to find a brand that doesn&#x27;t stink as much.</li>
    <li> Fast Shipment!!! Works great combine with other products !!!! I would defininely recommend.to friends and family to use for any at home remedies !! Is great in making at hair treatments!!!</li>
    <li> I am wholly pleased with every aspect of this purchase. With regards to the seller, it was securely packaged and was shipped much quicker than I anticipated. As to the oil, as other reviews stated it has an extremely strong scent...reminds me of opening a really old bottle of cheap dime store perfume circa 1975. It can be distracting. That being said, the benefits I have seen in only 2 uses are enough to keep me coming back for more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always had thick hair that is a cross between waves and spirals-depending how I let them lay. I got a bad dye job that left my hair extremely dry and damaged, but I found another product that was helping with that issue...a leave-in treatment. I love that product, but I am not sure that it was truly fixing my hair or just giving the appearance of healthier hair. Also, I have always shed large amounts of hair. Combing, running fingers through, washing...even hairs on the back of my shirt. Utterly aggravating &amp; a wonder I am not bald. Then for some odd reason my scalp just started feeling oogie, like it was never clean. I tried weekly coconut oil treatments and it slightly lowered the shedding, but not much. Did nothing for the way my scalp felt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw this oil and read all the reviews. Even though many complained about the strong scent, I figured I could just wear a shower cap. It just so happens that the day I received the oil was a hair wash day, &amp; I immediately covered my scalp then did the inversion massage. Ran it through to the ends (not completely soaked, but covered ), twisted up, covered with a shower cap &amp; washed 6 hours later. For the record, I can&#x27;t sleep with anything in my hair or on my head. I put the oil in my hair in the early afternoon and washed that night. I wash twice weekly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally, I wash, condition, good leave-in condition...&amp; as I said coconut oil (weekly, no less than 12 hours left in, with essential oils). Never stopped shedding. Slightly less after coconut oil for a day to 1 1/2 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the very first use of this oil, I wanted to see what would happen if I didn&#x27;t use the leave-in. I washed it out, only shampooing once. I didn&#x27;t want to completely strip my hair of the oil, but simply cleanse it out. The scent of my shampoo is pretty strong, so I wasn&#x27;t left with much of the oil scent. Then I conditioned with only a slight amount for three minutes. I finger comb while rinsing &amp; normally shed profusely while doing so-to the tune of a golf ball sized wad if I ball it up. This time I shed a grand total of 6 hairs. 6 HAIRS. I used no leave-in. Went to bed. Awoke the next morning to soft and shiny curls...NOT ONE HAIR ON MY PILLOW. My hair smelled good and my scalp felt amazing! For 3 days I had minimal shedding when I combed or ran my fingers through. Maybe one or two hairs on the back of my shirt during the day...as opposed to 20. Did the oil again, and used less (still no leave-in ) &amp; better results. My hair hasn&#x27;t looked or felt this healthy in years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t comment on growth or the slowing of grays yet, as it is much too soon. However, I will come back and update on that when time has passed. I wholeheartedly recommend this oil, and will keep buying it!y to 1 1/2 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the very first use of this oil, I wanted to see what would happen if I didn&#x27;t use the leave-in.

    <li> I like this hair oil alot. I have curly dark hair and I am trying my best to stay away from styling products even if they claim to be organic, to keep my hair frizz free. i  been sticking to natural organic oils as a moisturizer treatment for my hair and scalp .I use this oil as a styling product for every day use. I dont use alot though, and i use it with some coconut oil and jojoba oil. it keeps my hair soft and healthy and  well mositurized. I of course use it as a oil treatment about 3 times a week. my hair does not shed as much as before and  it keeps my hair in good condition so im pleased with that. I have a lil growth of hair but i think it was from my regular growth cycle. i will keep posted how my hair grows from regular use.</li>
    <li> It came in faster than expected, the smell is harsh but its totally worth it. it leaves my hair very shiny, not the type of shine wear it looks coated, but the type of shine where it beams from the inside out. so that means its a great hair food! I really enjoy this product and i will be continuing. :]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you could easily bypass its strong smell (due to its nature of being pure)&lt;br /&gt;then this will be your hair&#x27;s personal best friend next to water.</li>
    <li> This oil is all natural. No mineral or petroleum! I use on my edges and scalp and my hair shedding has really reduced dramatically. I love the smell. Its green in color like dark green. I will never be without this oil. Its has Amla, Bhrami, Sesame, Olive and another oil in it so it saves money. I can buy this one oil instead of one of each. I LOVE thus stuff!!!!</li>
    <li> I use this gem for part of my hot oil treatment and deep conditioning.  I add this to my conditioners or to other nutritious oils for hot oil treatment.  I then get under the dryer for a short time and love the effects of oil.  I have turned other naturals onto this product and they use it the same and love it just as much and the effects it has on their hair.  This is a wonderful find and I will continue to repurchase this product and use.  A little goes a long way.  I have not used this product to seal in moisture for any twist out or braid out.  I will eventually work up to that.</li>
    <li> Rely good for my hair this and Other ayurvedic products stop my loss hair and regrew strong and healthy again,Brahmi OIL use it alternating in the week several hours before Washing and twice a week using Brahmi power my hair is easy to comb and tangle almost part and leaves almost nothing much less ,clear that  I recomend</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t mind the smell.  I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> very concentrated amounts, don&#x27;t need a lot to go a long way, very smooth on the hair, excellent price as well</li>
    <li> While I&#x27;m sure this works great, I couldn&#x27;t use it long enough to tolerate the strong scent. Even after I washed my hair I could still smell it.</li>
    <li> The smell.... Makes a lot of messes... smell might give you a headache.... wouldn&#x27;t recommend! Very messy too!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS OIL PLEASE I WANT YOU TO ALWAYS HAVE IT AVAILABLE FOR ME AND EVERYONE OUT THERE!!! WILL BE ORDERING MY SECOND BOTTLE VERY SOON!!</li>
    <li> I would say that this product is great, except the scent is too strong. I have been using for about a month, I can see my hair getting shinier and healthier!. I have completely fried my hair over the years with dyes, chemicals, heat stylers and harsh shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;The studies that I read about bhrigaraj say that it took about 5 weeks for hair follicles to switch from telogen to anagen phase. I will post an update after the 5 weeks to let you all know if i see hair growth.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! Some people in their reviews did not like the smell of the oil but I love it! The oil helps with my dry scalp and I am seeing amazing hair growth within the first 2 weeks of using it</li>
    <li> My hair description: I am relaxed and my hair is shoulder length.  My hair color is dark brown.  I do not dye my hair.  This oil makes a fantastic pre-poo treatment.  I typically leave it on overnight and shampoo it out the next day.  I&#x27;ve noticed a significant increase in my thickness and I&#x27;ve had no more gray hairs come in since using this.  I don&#x27;t know if the oil has anything to do with that though as I have changed my diet and I&#x27;m taking vitamins as well.  I also use coconut oil in addition to this oil.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without this Mahabhringraj Oil it is awesome!!!!</li>
    <li> The oil arrived quickly and I read all of the reviews before I purchased. I was hesitant to purchase because most are saying that the scent is strong and lingers. However, I find that the scent is pleasantly somewhat strong. I only applied to my scalp with a cotton ball after parting my hair and the scent was mild. It has an herbal scent and if you use too much it will be over bearing. I think it&#x27;s worth it to try and experiment. I would not recommend adding this to your hair, only your scalp because it can be kind of strong. It&#x27;s also green and I hope that it is not green from food coloring. Hopefully it&#x27;s the plant colors. The bottle only lists plant ingredients and nothing else.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only been a few days but after I got past the smell (you get used to it) I can say this oil has made my hair very soft. I am AA with mostly 4C hair. I can&#x27;t comment on the growth yet but I massage every night and my hair is baby soft. I have very dry hair so every night is good for me. Will update later on growth.  Shipping was within a few days and the product arrived as expected.  Also, the consistency is like water. AND a little goes a long way. I&#x27;m sure this bottle will last a few months.</li>
    <li> Have to wait and see if it works . Never  used it before heard much  about it. strong smell to it.</li>
    <li> Seems to work great for last two months, will update after few more months and when i can confirm that there is a difference in hair. So far it seems to have done something better, hair fall has reduced a lot.</li>
    <li> This is a very nourishing hair oil. The smell is not the best but it fades over time. I mix this oil with mustard oil and it is a very powerful growth oil.I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> This product smells funny, but it realy works to imporve the quality of my hair and asssits with hair growth.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love the way it has decreased my hair fall, however it has done little to nothing for my alopecia spots.  I will give it a little more time.  The smell is strong but OK.</li>
    <li> I use this oil almost every day and my hair looks and feels healthy with a beautiful sheen. Hair fall has decreased dramatically. My only regret is not knowing about it sooner.  :)</li>
    <li> Awesome oil. Almost cured my stubborn seborrhea and hairline looks much fuller in just a few weeks. The smell is strong, but I love how it resembles sandalwood.</li>
    <li> I love this oil . I have thick curly coarse hair &amp; when using this product I notice my curls are tamed &amp; a lustrous shine .</li>
    <li> Great oil to reduce hair fall. Leave it overnight and wash it out in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;Makes hair soft &amp; shiny as well.. the smell is a little strong, but goes away after washing. A little expensive for a tiny bottle, but worth the price if you want a good hair oil which helps reduce your hair fall</li>
