      <li>perfect for my daughter</li>
      <li>Perfect for my toddlers hair styles!</li>
      <li>These are perfect for baby/toddler hair.</li>
      <li>and these are some of the best elastics I&#x27;ve purchased!</li>
      <li>These things are the best for my daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
      <li>They stretch wonderfully without breaking.</li>
      <li>These used to be the good ones!</li>
      <li>Great for baby hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not that good.</li>
      <li>Great customer service and great product for fine baby hair.</li>
      <li>Good product but slip out of my one year olds fine hair, she can pull them out or just rubbing her head on her car seat</li>
      <li>These come in lots of cute colors</li>
      <li>Using one more than once is akin to wrapping a piece of string around my hair.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>These are the more &amp;#34;plasticy&amp;#34; material that I like because my toddler&#x27;s fine hair doesn&#x27;t stick to them the way it does with &amp;#34;rubbery&amp;#34; elastics.</li>
      <li>They do go on easily in her hair except the smallest size.</li>
      <li>THey break way to easy</li>
      <li>Easy to use in my daughter&#x27;s hair with no ouchies😉</li>
      <li>I do like the bright colors as does our almost four year old.</li>
      <li>These slip out of my daughters super fine hair really easily.</li>
      <li>They stretch out, thinning the elastic, and do not return to close their original size.</li>
      <li>and they really do stay in place and yet are super easy (and ouchless!)</li>
      <li>Some reviewers who have straight hair love this product.</li>
      <li>Pretty easy to put on</li>
      <li>The other two sizes work great, and it does slide off the hair pretty easily.</li>
      <li>I am currently using the middle size for my 9-month old&#x27;s fine hair and they are the perfect size</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m breaking so many a week that they will surely be gone in less than a year.</li>
      <li>They work great, but unfortunately are only good for one to two uses.</li>
      <li>Work well fast shipment!</li>
      <li>These are way better than I expected!</li>
      <li>I do not recommend these for hair that is not straight and easy to manage.</li>
      <li>More than half have snapped while in my hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m surprised by any positive reviews.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I bought these because 12 years ago I bought the exact same thing (brand, style, amount, etc) at a store and they lasted me until about 6 months ago.</li>
      <li>they are not like the old rubber bands that came out...</li>
      <li>(so far) today.</li>
      <li>as if the rubber was old.</li>
      <li>I got these for my toddler&#x27;s wild hair.</li>
      <li>but only had one break so far.</li>
      <li>I like the larger size for one large ponytail (I usually use 2 large ones for 1 ponytail).</li>

<li> I got these for my toddler&#x27;s wild hair.</li>

<li> I like the larger size for one large ponytail (I usually use 2 large ones for 1 ponytail).</li>
<li> When my daughter&#x27;s baby hair was just long enough for a half-up ponytail, I used the smallest size.</li>
<li> Not perfect as it rips out fine hairs, but I think that&#x27;s inevitable.  </li>
<li> Now that she&#x27;s a little older, I use the smallest size for her little side braids and the larger sizes for ponytail days.</li>
<li> , they dnt get tangled, if it does only little bit and can untangle her hair; it is if I only leave them in her hair too long Over night.</li>
<li> I usually throw them away after one use because they pull off all twisted up, but at this price I&#x27;m ok with that.</li>
<li> After being used once they get a stretched out, and usually just break apart partway through the second day of use.</li>
<li> I either lost them or stretched them so much they were useless.</li>
<li> The small size is pretty useless, even on a 2 year olds hair.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure who you would use the smallest size on, as it&#x27;s difficult to stretch it out big enough for adults fingers to put it on the hair</li>
<li> Dangerous if you have young children or pets.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
<li> These were nothing like the ones I usually use.  </li>
<li> By breaking all the time, I mean I broke 2 yesterday and 1</li>
<li> My hair is so thin I have bald spots when I wear a ponytail, and my daughter&#x27;s hair is thin as well.</li>
<li> I can count on one hand the times one had broken.</li>
<li> And some have disappeared from my hair having broken while I slept.</li>
<li> They got stuck in my hair and were very uncomfortable.  </li>
<li> They&#x27;re impossible to break and don&#x27;t pull on her hair.  </li>
<li> but they are terrible quality.</li>
<li> These hair bands are of terrible quality.  </li>

    <li> I like using these in my baby&#x27;s hair, they dnt get tangled, if it does only little bit and can untangle her hair; it is if I only leave them in her hair too long Over night.</li>
    <li> perfect for my daughter</li>
    <li> THey break way to easy</li>
    <li> Great for baby hair. Pretty easy to put on and they don&#x27;t hurt their heads.</li>
    <li> I got these for my toddler&#x27;s wild hair. They work great, but unfortunately are only good for one to two uses. After being used once they get a stretched out, and usually just break apart partway through the second day of use.</li>
    <li> Great customer service and great product for fine baby hair. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> These things are the best for my daughter&#x27;s hair.  They&#x27;re impossible to break and don&#x27;t pull on her hair.  Buy these.</li>
    <li> Good product but slip out of my one year olds fine hair, she can pull them out or just rubbing her head on her car seat they come out.</li>
    <li> I do like the bright colors as does our almost four year old. They do go on easily in her hair except the smallest size. I&#x27;m not sure who you would use the smallest size on, as it&#x27;s difficult to stretch it out big enough for adults fingers to put it on the hair That is why I gave it four stars. The other two sizes work great, and it does slide off the hair pretty easily.</li>
    <li> These are way better than I expected! I am currently using the middle size for my 9-month old&#x27;s fine hair and they are the perfect size and they really do stay in place and yet are super easy (and ouchless!) to get out!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this brand before and the bands usually last 3-4 uses but for some reason these medium sized bands keep breaking after 1 use.  The small size is pretty useless, even on a 2 year olds hair. I like the larger size for one large ponytail (I usually use 2 large ones for 1 ponytail).</li>
    <li> Easy to use in my daughter&#x27;s hair with no ouchies😉</li>
    <li> Not perfect as it rips out fine hairs, but I think that&#x27;s inevitable.  I like that these come in a variety of sizes and colors.  We are losing these all the time... but only had one break so far.</li>
    <li> These come in lots of cute colors but they are terrible quality. They break everytime I use them and if they don&#x27;t break they pull clumps of my daughter&#x27;s hair out. I cant stand these things but Im stuck with a million of them.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my toddlers hair styles!</li>
    <li> Wish you could just buy the smallest size!</li>
    <li> These hair bands are of terrible quality.  I&#x27;m surprised by any positive reviews. Did I get a defective pack?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- They stretch out, thinning the elastic, and do not return to close their original size. Using one more than once is akin to wrapping a piece of string around my hair.&lt;br /&gt;- More than half have snapped while in my hair. And some have disappeared from my hair having broken while I slept. Dangerous if you have young children or pets.&lt;br /&gt;- They are not ouchless. They hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- They are plentiful. (That earns them the one requisite star.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I have curly hair. Some reviewers who have straight hair love this product. Perhaps there&#x27;s some property of curly hair that make these bands expand, break, and vanish.</li>
    <li> My daughter has curly hair. These bands pulled hair every time we tried to remove them. I do not recommend these for hair that is not straight and easy to manage.</li>
    <li> These are perfect for baby/toddler hair. They stretch wonderfully without breaking. When my daughter&#x27;s baby hair was just long enough for a half-up ponytail, I used the smallest size. Now that she&#x27;s a little older, I use the smallest size for her little side braids and the larger sizes for ponytail days. I usually throw them away after one use because they pull off all twisted up, but at this price I&#x27;m ok with that.</li>
    <li> I bought these because 12 years ago I bought the exact same thing (brand, style, amount, etc) at a store and they lasted me until about 6 months ago. I either lost them or stretched them so much they were useless. I can count on one hand the times one had broken. These, however, break all the time. I will never buy them again. My hair is so thin I have bald spots when I wear a ponytail, and my daughter&#x27;s hair is thin as well. By breaking all the time, I mean I broke 2 yesterday and 1 (so far) today. I&#x27;m breaking so many a week that they will surely be gone in less than a year. I&#x27;ve tried different hairstyles using the ranging sizes of bands, and all break.</li>
    <li> What happened?! These used to be the good ones! They constantly snap and break off.</li>
    <li> they are not like the old rubber bands that came out...these stretch out...as if the rubber was old.</li>
    <li> I use hair bands all the time.  These were nothing like the ones I usually use.  They got stuck in my hair and were very uncomfortable.  I would not buy them again.</li>
    <li> These are the more &amp;#34;plasticy&amp;#34; material that I like because my toddler&#x27;s fine hair doesn&#x27;t stick to them the way it does with &amp;#34;rubbery&amp;#34; elastics. I know, scientific terms.</li>
    <li> I have four girls and these are some of the best elastics I&#x27;ve purchased!</li>
    <li> Work well fast shipment!</li>
    <li> These slip out of my daughters super fine hair really easily.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not that good. It keeps breaking</li>
