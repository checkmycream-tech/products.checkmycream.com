    <li> Hubby has bad arthritis and this really gets to the pain.  It has almost no smell.  It&#x27;s not a heat generating type of pain relief but rather a topical analgesic.</li>
    <li> I find X-tra Strength Pain-A-Trate works very well. Does not take all the pain away, but makes it bearable. I have had other people try it and they say the same thing. My Arthritis will never go away, but am so glad I found this item. Thanx</li>
