      <li>Lightning Fast Ship, Super Deal, Thank You !!!  </li>
      <li>I was really bummed when B&amp;BW stopped carrying this lotion, but I am so happy I was able to get a few more bottles!</li>
      <li>, it potency is a GOOD thing because you only need two pea-sizes dots for the whole day, which means that this awesome manly-ass smelling lotion 8oz bottle will last me a loooooong time.</li>
      <li>I really like the way this lotion makes me feel and the &amp;#34;oak&amp;#34; scent is my favorite.</li>
      <li>Smells kinda like cologne honestly; gave it four stars cause its not really a scent I want for the summer.</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t go down the drain with the water like most scents do.  </li>
      <li>It should be used to give you a nice accent scent that still is subtle and not as noticeable as splashing cologne</li>
      <li>It also smells pretty dang terrific.</li>
      <li>That said you shouldn&#x27;t use this in large amounts to moisturize dry skin, as your eyes (and everyone around you) will water up.</li>

<li> My husband loves the scent although they don&#x27;t last all day long.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a fragrance that I like, and is subtle enough that someone would have to be very close to smell it.</li>
<li> It is not inexpensive, but a little dab goes a long way.</li>
<li> I decided to try the lotion because it doesn&#x27;t include cucumber melon or any other fruit coconut smell.  </li>
<li> Uses it everyday and the fragrance stays with him all day</li>
<li> I wouldn&#x27;t say that it smells like wood of any sort, but it does smell faintly of cologne.</li>

    <li> My wife bought me the body wash and I like the smell and it doesn&#x27;t go down the drain with the water like most scents do.  I decided to try the lotion because it doesn&#x27;t include cucumber melon or any other fruit coconut smell.  It is a perfect compliment to the wash.  Girls hold onto me longer when I get hugs.  Just saying. ;)</li>
