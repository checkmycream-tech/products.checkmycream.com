      <li>He is so happy about the whole thing.</li>
      <li>I love everything about this holder with the exception of one thing- the bottom is felted.  </li>

      <li>but it looks nice and holds everything just right.</li>
      <li>stand easily accommodates my long-handled (100mm/4inch) Merkur razor with 25mm (1 inch) of height to spare.  </li>
      <li>My husband&#x27;s razor seats well, and the brush fits fine too.</li>

      <li>and it works fine.  </li>
      <li>This holder fits my Tweezerman brush and my Parker safety razor just fine.</li>
      <li>Feels solid, looks great.  </li>
      <li>I purchased a brush that comes with free plastic holder.</li>
      <li>It is a cinch to keep clean and sanitary.  </li>
      <li>matches my razor great, but it scratches easier than expected.</li>
      <li>This stand will last for a good while.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice to have the razor/shave brush off the counter where it can dry better.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s more than 3/4 of a pound - more than enough to do the job.</li>
      <li>It looks good in my bathroom and keeps my razor and brush clean and dry.</li>
      <li>Amazon was quick to replace it and the problem was resolved.  </li>
      <li>but if it does what its spose to do then its worth it.</li>

      <li>I looked around and fund a bunch of these at much higher prices so the lower cost of this enticed me to purchase</li>
      <li>I had an issue with the first stand that arrived.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different recommendations and the stains are better, but they&#x27;re not gone.  </li>
      <li>It holds my razor and brush and looks exactly like it is pictured.  </li>
      <li>Good, study, heavy stand.</li>
      <li>Also, the merkur long handle has two knobs on the bottom of the top portion, and they don&#x27;t allow for the razor to sit level on the arms of the stand.</li>
      <li>When I buy a brush in the future, I&#x27;ll be sure the handle is large enough to fit the Stand.</li>
      <li>Holds the larger size brushes easily.  </li>

      <li>My primary shave brush is a Parker Safety Razor silvertip badger brush with a big knot.  </li>
      <li>its heavy and sturdy enough and my parker 96r razor and shaving brush fit nicely on it.</li>
      <li>It will hold it, but only by placing the brush in the prongs where the bristles meet the handle, the handle itself won&#x27;t fit in the prongs.  </li>
      <li>Thanks.)</li>
      <li>and it is very well built.</li>

      <li>I bought this for the wife for her to store here badger brush and razor since she like mine so much.  </li>
      <li>I use The Art of Shavings badger brush which does fit into the stand however just barely and is a little snug but it does fit!</li>
      <li>The only drawback that I experienced was the fact that the handle on my brush was too small and the Stand wouldn&#x27;t hold it.  </li>
      <li>The only concern at this point is the bottom of the stand has left a blackish stain on the marble counter top.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The brush holder can only hold by the hair not the handle.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the wife for her to store here badger brush and razor since she like mine so much.  Nothing fancy about it but it looks nice and holds everything just right.</li>
    <li> Ended up returning it. The construction and craftsman ship were top notch, but the brush slot was just wayyyyyyy too small for my medium size badger. Unfortunate.</li>
    <li> like others have stated, the stand will stain your bathroom sink. put something under it. guess designer did not think that it would ever get wet. it does work to dry the brush and razor on.</li>
    <li> I love everything about this holder with the exception of one thing- the bottom is felted.  If you&#x27;re anything like me, you like your shaving system to be by the sink &amp; occasionally water can get splashed around, especially as you&#x27;re building lather.  When the stand has gotten wet- even from the brush or razor slightly dripping, the felt can get wet &amp; it actually marked the counter in my old apartment.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to be a problem now, but it would be nice if they considered some rubberized feet impressed into a plastic bottom instead.  Holds both the brush &amp; razor well.  If your brush handle is too thick, try resting it with just the knot of the brush hanging below.  Worked well for me &amp; it usually balances easily without falling.</li>
    <li> Excellent stand-looks elegant. The prong for the razor could be a bit wider to accommodate fusion razors. Overall an excellent product, good value for the price</li>
    <li> Very attractive stand, fits my husband&#x27;s Merkur Razor and Escali Badger Brush well.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, when it gets wet the base leaves a rust stain on the marble countertop of the sink. (Although to be fair the sink gets stains from hard water too, marble really is a nightmare to keep clean!)&lt;br /&gt;So be careful not to get the stand wet if you also have marble sink!&lt;br /&gt;I cut a little base for it out of an old styrofoam plate, I hope it will help prevent it from staining the sink in the future.&lt;br /&gt;But other than that problem, it&#x27;s a nice little stand.</li>
    <li> Good, study, heavy stand. Works fine with my Parker safety razor. It requires very minimal cleaning and you can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because it is a very attractive piece.  It looks good on my sink with my razor and brush.  The only drawback that I experienced was the fact that the handle on my brush was too small and the Stand wouldn&#x27;t hold it.  I slid a rubber tip on my brush handle and it works fine.  It appears to be well constructed.  When I buy a brush in the future, I&#x27;ll be sure the handle is large enough to fit the Stand.</li>
    <li> matches my razor great, but it scratches easier than expected. Also, the merkur long handle has two knobs on the bottom of the top portion, and they don&#x27;t allow for the razor to sit level on the arms of the stand. Otherwise, it&#x27;s working swell.</li>
    <li> Looks great, holds my DE razor and my brush without falling over.  It started to mark my counter (rubber feet on the bottom), so I placed something underneath.  No issues so far.</li>
    <li> The stand is sturdy and well made, the only gripe is that the brush holder prongs are a bit narrow, but as other reviewers have noted it&#x27;s an easy enough task to bend them out slightly if you&#x27;d like to hold your brush nearer the base rather than the &amp;#34;neck&amp;#34; area.  It&#x27;s a great value for the price.</li>
    <li> Started to Rust a Little in the Steam from he Shower. But all in all Pretty Good</li>
    <li> Great product. Feels solid, looks great.  Product was packaged very nicely for shipping.  Holds the larger size brushes easily.  The chrome finish has a nice look.</li>
    <li> This stand does not fit todays new type of razors making it somwhat useless. I just use my soap cup to store my brush. I leave my razor in it&#x27;s initial caddy.</li>
    <li> My fiance loves this razor stand. However it is black felt like material on the bottom, which has stained my sink due to it getting wet with water. other than that I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I got this for my hubby and he loves it. It&#x27;s nice to have the razor/shave brush off the counter where it can dry better. His Parker brush and Merkur Futur Double Edge safety razor that both fit without any problems.</li>
    <li> I gave this Stand 4 stars because I have only had it 2 moths.  In a year i might come back and give it the 5th star. With that said, I am very pleased with the quality of the stand. It is well balanced. It holds either the brush or razor individually with out even looking like it is going to tip over. It is a cinch to keep clean and sanitary.  It looks great too.</li>
    <li> makes my safety razor and brush look very professional and modern. it is solid and heavy enough to get knocked around and not tip.</li>
    <li> I have a Parker 99R razor and a 24&#x27;m brush and this stand is perfect. The quality is comparable to my razor and it&#x27;s very sturdy. The finish is beautiful.</li>
    <li> I love this. It looks good in my bathroom and keeps my razor and brush clean and dry. Recommended whole-heartedly!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem solidly put together (the shaft jiggles on the base, and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be an obvious way to tighten) - but worse is the stains the stand leaves. If the faux-velvet on the bottom of the base gets wet, it leaves black stains and rust - big drawback for an item for use in the bathroom.</li>
    <li> just awesome,  perfect for my razor</li>
    <li> Works great. Fit my art of shaving brush and razor.!!! great stand with a very good price. Looking to save ,excellent route.</li>
    <li> Nice chrome stand and the base is weighted enough to keep your razor and brush without any worry of tipping over.  Only one gripe, the prongs for the brush side aren&#x27;t wide enough to accommodate my current brush which is a Van der Hagen boar brush.  It&#x27;s the basic one that comes with their &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; shave kit.  It will hold it, but only by placing the brush in the prongs where the bristles meet the handle, the handle itself won&#x27;t fit in the prongs.  I&#x27;ve ordered an Edwin Jagger Silvertip Badger brush and will see if that handle fits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still a great item at an excellent price.</li>
    <li> glad I went with this stand instead of the cheaper model I was considering buying. its heavy and sturdy enough and my parker 96r razor and shaving brush fit nicely on it. maybe a little pricey but if it does what its spose to do then its worth it. I would recommend this product, at least for my needs</li>
    <li> I have been using this stand for 6 weeks and find it does the job perfectly. I am very pleased with it and it is very well built.</li>
    <li> Perfectly weighted, balanced, and overall a nice sturdy stand. This stand will last for a good while. I would recommend this item for everybody.</li>
    <li> This brush and razor stand was what I needed and looks great with my Merkur and brush and I recommend this to anyone looking for a stand for these items</li>
    <li> I bought this for my fiancé and he likes it a lot, so in that way, it&#x27;s a success.  The only downfall is that it leaves black circular stains on our bathroom counter that are difficult to remove.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different recommendations and the stains are better, but they&#x27;re not gone.  You might want to invest in something to put under this stand if you purchase it.</li>
    <li> The stand itself is great, but the base has much to be desired.  The \\&quot;felt\\&quot; (or whatever it is) on the bottom of the base will leave a horrible black circle if it gets wet.  Come on, it sets on a sink!  I took this it off and found rust on the base.  I cleaned the rust off of the bottom and then sprayed it with clear lacquer., I replaced the felt, then sprayed that.  Problem solved.    Update 8 months later:  Rust stains are back,  I now have a permanent stain on the white sink top.  Had to place the stand in a small glass coaster.  Down rated the item to 2 stars.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it!!! He is so happy about the whole thing. He likes shaving the old fashioned way than with these blades that are out there that last a much shorter period of time. He loves the stand to be able to put his razor &amp; brush on.</li>
    <li> The bottom leaves black rings on my white sink. Other than that husband likes it. It fits his razor and badgers brush perfectly.</li>
    <li> After 10 months of everyday use it is holding up well.  No issues at all.  Fits my Merkur razor and Parker brush nicely.  It has never tipped over and still looks great after you do the occasion soap scum wipe down.</li>
    <li> Great price. Quality I good. Heavier than I thought it would be which is of course a good thing. Happy customer here.</li>
    <li> I looked around and fund a bunch of these at much higher prices so the lower cost of this enticed me to purchase it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far it seems well worth the cost and I am having trouble comprehending why others are priced as high as they are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only time will tell on the longevity of this product.</li>
    <li> I keep my Edwin Jagger equipment on this and it works wonderfully. Thank you for a wonderful product, I rate it highly.</li>
    <li> Very nice stand. High quality. Looks like the day I bought it several months later.</li>
    <li> Searched far and wide to find one of these at a good price point with decent reviews. Well, this stand works well but... My husband&#x27;s razor seats well, and the brush fits fine too. So far, no pitting of the finish. The only concern at this point is the bottom of the stand has left a blackish stain on the marble counter top. We were able to get most of it off, but I do not suggest leaving the bottom exposed to the counter. I have the stand now sitting on something to help avoid further issues. Hopefully that is the only down side to this stand.</li>
    <li> This holder fits my Tweezerman brush and my Parker safety razor just fine. It has a nice finish and is sturdy. No complaints! It is worth the price.</li>
    <li> This thing is heavier duty than I thought! My razor and brush can hang without falling over like with my old plastic stand. Great product.</li>
    <li> My husband bought three of these for himself and our sons.  It is just what he was looking for when shaving.</li>
    <li> I am extremely happy with this stand, good size and weight, holds my Merkur #180 razor perfectly. I use The Art of Shavings badger brush which does fit into the stand however just barely and is a little snug but it does fit!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s firm and stable. Good material. THe only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the bottom stains the surface where it stands. I haven&#x27;t been able to remove the stain off the counter. It arrived on time.</li>
    <li> My primary shave brush is a Parker Safety Razor silvertip badger brush with a big knot.  I use a lower-end Tweezerman brush for my pre-shave soap.  I was concerned that my big, fluffy Parker brush would not fit on this stand, but I am pleased to report that it fits with room to spare (about 4mm at the base of the knot).  My Parker brush is very \\&quot;wide\\&quot; (ie, the bristles spread out quite a lot - it&#x27;s a fat brush), but only a few (maybe a half dozen) of the outermost bristles come in contact with the stand when hung to dry.  And, of course, my smaller and narrower Tweezerman fits fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised to find that the stand ***PERFECTLY*** matches my Merkur Long Handled Razor #180 in both chrome finish and crosshatch detail.  The crosshatching is IDENTICAL (in pitch, depth, and spacing) to my Merkur razor.  Many (but not all) Merkur razors have this same finish, and would match just as nicely.  Anyone who saw my razor on this stand would surely assume they were both purchased as a kit from the same manufacturer (but, alas, Merkur does not make stands).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand easily accommodates my long-handled (100mm/4inch) Merkur razor with 25mm (1 inch) of height to spare.  It is nice and heavy, being weighted at the bottom - 270g/9.5oz total, according to my postal scale.  That&#x27;s more than 3/4 of a pound - more than enough to do the job. And it looks terrific on my bathroom counter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(If you find my review helpful, please \\&quot;like\\&quot; it. Thanks.)</li>
    <li> Prongs are too wide to hold my brush and made of a cheap material. This seller does not offer returns.</li>
    <li> This holds my [[ASIN:B000NL0T1G Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor]] and [[ASIN:B002RJC1HC Parker Safety Razor 100% Pure Badger Bristle Shaving Brush with Black Deluxe Handle]] perfectly, even though the brush is quite large. As other reviewers have pointed out this stand is quite heavy and is not easy to knock over. I don&#x27;t see any reason to get the more expensive examples available here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> The stand accommodates different size brushes. The finish is very well done and the stand has a good weight to it.</li>
    <li> Good looking stand. Minimalist design. Heavy enough to counterbalance the weight of the razor or the brush. It stays where you put it, which is what you need it to do. Works.</li>
    <li> Stand has a nice finish, holds brush and razor as stated</li>
    <li> Nice weight and good chrome look. The only problem I have is with the brush holder,  it&#x27;s a tad small and my brush doesn&#x27;t fit</li>
    <li> Looks just as shown in the picture and my husband has no complaints about it so far. No chipping or scratches found.</li>
    <li> I had an issue with the first stand that arrived.  Looked like there was a problem with the manufacturing.  Amazon was quick to replace it and the problem was resolved.  No issues with the second one.  It is exactly what I expected.  It holds my razor and brush and looks exactly like it is pictured.  Would recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> This shaving stand fits my Merkur razor and shaving brush perfectly, even the finish on the post matches the handle on the razor.</li>
    <li> I purchased a brush that comes with free plastic holder. But I also purchased this chrome holder. It is very nice quality and looks very cool.</li>
