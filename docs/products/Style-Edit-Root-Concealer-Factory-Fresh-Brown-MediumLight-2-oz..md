### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>and I&#x27;m very happy I chose this.</li>
      <li>This really is an awesome product.</li>
      <li>and it is WONDERFUL!!!  </li>
      <li>this stuff is awesome.  </li>
      <li>Works great on the hair!</li>
      <li>Great fix for in-between colorings.  </li>
      <li>This is great.</li>
      <li>Works great.  </li>
      <li>Great for the In between salon appointments.</li>
      <li>This product is absolutely amazing!</li>
      <li>This product dries quickly, conceals perfectly, and is a great color match.  </li>
      <li>That doesn&#x27;t look good because it creates spots of color.</li>
      <li>I should mention that when I fully color my hair, I use Clairol Perfect 10 By Nice &#x27;N Easy Hair Color 005a Medium Ash Brown.</li>
      <li>I was on the fence whether I should purchase the medium/light brown or the black/dark brown, but I decided to get the medium/light brown, and I&#x27;m very glad I did.</li>
      <li>I love it!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty impressed with this product.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s very easy to wipe or wash off.</li>
      <li>I might even like it better because it gives the allusion of more hair!</li>
      <li>I originally bought this through my hairdresser and loved it.  </li>
      <li>brand is definitely much better than any of those cover sticks or wands.</li>
      <li>One 2 oz container lasts me about  3 months or more.</li>
      <li>I also ordered those and they work better.</li>
      <li>I like the sprays much better than the lipstick looking tubes and mascara looking wands because they are not as sticky or waxy.</li>
      <li>If you do it this way, rubbing it around and combing it through, the coverage is much better and makes it blend nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Just make sure you have a light hand and a pulse spray  not continuos spray.  </li>
      <li>working great so far.</li>
      <li>The shipping was quick and easy!  </li>
      <li>Easy to use.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use.  </li>
      <li>Works great for covering grow-out until my next color appointment.</li>
      <li>If it works, which I doubt, great, if not, I&#x27;m only out $20.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
      <li>I use medium light brown.  </li>
      <li>I moved out of state and didn&#x27;t know where I would find this product, but good old Amazon had it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This stuff is worth its weight in gold!</li>
      <li>It takes a moment to dry and then leaves a pleasant texture, not greasy or sticky at all.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy to finally find a product that really works for grays.</li>
      <li>This color is much more of a flat medium brown than my hair, but it looks okay at the part/hairline.</li>
      <li>Now I finally can because this is an amazing product.</li>
      <li>The claims are right about it not coming out until washing.  </li>
      <li>Have dark brown/black hair and this is a lighter color but blends in real nice to give a natural highlight look</li>
      <li>It blends in with my color almost exactly.</li>
      <li>The spray nozzle is just like Rita Hazin&#x27;s brand long and pointed which is good to direct the spray where needed.</li>
      <li>If I cover my forehead with a wash cloth while I spray the front of my head, so much color is deposited onto my scalp that when I remove the washcloth it leaves an overly straight line, and I end up with the Eddie Munster effect.  </li>
      <li>I got the light to medium Brown since there was only one blonde choice and from others reviews it is probably too light.</li>
      <li>Really like the product.</li>
      <li>You spray it on and it really does blend in.</li>
      <li>So, it&#x27;s fine for the back of my head, or underneath if I want to put my hair up in a high ponytail.  </li>
      <li>The only type of application that avoids the problem of messy hairlines or too much color deposited onto the scalp is using a wand applicator that looks like a large mascara wand, but I haven&#x27;t yet found one that&#x27;s good.  </li>
      <li>It is easy to use, matches really well and actually makes the grey look freshly touched up.  </li>
      <li>Not worth it it dripped onto a favorite shirt.</li>
      <li>I can not tell you enough how much of a fan I am!!  </li>
      <li>As my color grows out, I don&#x27;t have a solid line of grey hair, just many strands in with my brown.</li>
      <li>Most are extremely messy and don&#x27;t stay put, ending up all over my hands if I touch my hair, smearing my skin if I sweat at the gym, or staining my pillow.  </li>
      <li>Holding it a few inches away from your head allows the color to deposit more evenly, but as a result it winds up all over your face if you try to spray around your hairline.  </li>
      <li>Shampoos out easily, takes only a second to apply.  </li>
      <li>(it&#x27;s fine textured and non-greasy) and this lasts nicely to a second or third day.</li>
      <li>I have medium brown hair and my new growth is 100% gray at this point.  </li>
      <li>Be sure to shake well - especially as the container nears empty.</li>
      <li>When you first start spraying, it comes out quick, very forcefully, and localized, meaning that it will shoot out over a small circular area.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s no where near as sticky as wands or sticks.</li>
      <li>I only have grey on the top of my head, so after I style my hair, there is usually grey showing in my part.  </li>
      <li>and I would try and spread my visits to the salon as far as I could.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had no trouble with it rubbing off.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t go far the way this works.</li>
      <li>No messy residue.  </li>
      <li>Get someone else to do it for you and cover the hair you don&#x27;t want colored with an old towel or two.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything else, and nothing looks natural.</li>
      <li>My order came on time, and I really like it for occasional root touch-ups.  </li>
      <li>Good coverage, just hate the feel on my head and cannot wear light colored headbands, color comes off on hair accessories.</li>
      <li>When hair is wet, the spray seems to spread over more hair areas a little easier.</li>
      <li>This color is pretty dark</li>
      <li>It just deposits a ton of color onto my scalp, so it&#x27;s very obvious that I&#x27;m using root concealer if I put it near my hairline.  </li>
      <li>Hard to control the spray...comes out too much and too fast.</li>
      <li>I have medium brown hair, with a red tinge from dying it myself with home dye (I use natural medium brown by Garnier) and am would definitely recommend this color over the dark brown unless you really have black/brown hair.</li>
      <li>I find that it&#x27;s harder and takes much longer doing it on dry hair.</li>
      <li>A couple of quick sprays, no more grey!  </li>

<li> A couple of quick sprays, no more grey!  </li>
<li> I actually have very thick, long hair, so this stuff really does just deposit that much color onto the skin.  </li>
<li> It takes a little getting used to and some finesse to get the spray coming out more slowly so that it can spray over a larger area, but I have that down pretty well after just a few sprays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is it&#x27;s hard to spray just a little because the spray comes out pretty hard so try to have a light trigger finger if possible!</li>
<li> If I see any areas where there&#x27;s too much or too little coverage, I use a wet tissue to spread it on and around those areas.</li>
<li> When I cover my grays, I always do it on wet hair, not dry.</li>
<li> As I mentioned, it does leave a tiny bit of a stickiness on the hair, but it&#x27;s not much.</li>
<li> I do get a tiny bit on my hands and face, but not much</li>
<li> the grey grow line between colorings until finding this product.  </li>
<li> As I mentioned, it does leave a tiny bit of a stickiness on the hair, but it&#x27;s not much.</li>
<li> so I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last, as the can is on the smaller side (only 2 oz), but I think I will continue buying and using this one no matter what.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s and unfortunately get quite a few grey hairs, way too many to just tweeze out along my part and hairline...</li>
<li> After I blow dry and style, I spray this on my part and temple area and voila...</li>
<li> I have colored dark blonde hair with highlights.  </li>
<li> I use it for the middle and back of my head, away from the hairline, because it&#x27;s very messy.  </li>
<li> It is a concealer, though, so it will leave some effects such as a little stickiness, however I did not notice any flaking at all.</li>
<li> /&gt;You have to be careful, though.</li>
<li> when I&#x27;m wet then use a comb</li>
<li> I had been using Rita Hazin dark blonde and since this is also a spray &amp; about $10 less I decided to try it.</li>
<li> Even though it has a narrow nozzle that should help to target a specific area, you have to hold it several inches away from your head because otherwise it will deposit a concentrated blob of color in one small area.</li>
<li> I keep my part messy to make the grey less noticeable and then apply this spray to my part/hairline.</li>
<li> If you&#x27;re a dark blonde/light brown</li>
<li> I think it would be too dark for you.</li>
<li> but I&#x27;ll have to see how long it lasts (small bottle).</li>
<li> Spray often spittles down onto your face, clothes and surfaces.</li>

    <li> Hard to control the spray...comes out too much and too fast. Spray often spittles down onto your face, clothes and surfaces.</li>
    <li> Great fix for in-between colorings.  Easy to use.  I use a Q-tip on the part to avoid spraying the scalp.  Works just as well as the expensive $25 version sold at Nordy&#x27;s et al.  Let&#x27;s me stretch my color for another week or two.  Shampoos out easily, takes only a second to apply.  No messy residue.  Dries instantly.  One 2 oz container lasts me about  3 months or more.</li>
    <li> I wish it was a little less expensive but I&#x27;ll have to see how long it lasts (small bottle). Works great for covering grow-out until my next color appointment.</li>
    <li> Really like the product. Works great on the hair! But it&#x27;s expensive for the amount of product you get!</li>
    <li> I took the advice of another review and&lt;br /&gt;spray when I&#x27;m wet then use a comb&lt;br /&gt;Its working great so far.</li>
    <li> Have dark brown/black hair and this is a lighter color but blends in real nice to give a natural highlight look</li>
    <li> This is a must product!  I can not tell you enough how much of a fan I am!!  This product dries quickly, conceals perfectly, and is a great color match.  The shipping was quick and easy!  I hope they will never quit making this stuff!!</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  Just make sure you have a light hand and a pulse spray  not continuos spray.  Great for the In between salon appointments.</li>
    <li> Not worth it it dripped onto a favorite shirt. I tried to use it on cotton balls after that. Still nit that well so I got my hair highlighted blond to hide the gray longer... Oh 2 oz. don&#x27;t go far the way this works. I would say try the marker or the powder with the brush. I also ordered those and they work better.</li>
    <li> My order came on time, and I really like it for occasional root touch-ups.  This way,  I don&#x27;t have to color my hair as often.</li>
    <li> This is great. Hides all the gray and totally matches my hair color. I just wish it would last longer than when I wash my hair!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty impressed with this product. I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s and unfortunately get quite a few grey hairs, way too many to just tweeze out along my part and hairline... I read the reviews on this spray and also the mascara type cover ups and I&#x27;m very happy I chose this. As my color grows out, I don&#x27;t have a solid line of grey hair, just many strands in with my brown. I keep my part messy to make the grey less noticeable and then apply this spray to my part/hairline. It takes a moment to dry and then leaves a pleasant texture, not greasy or sticky at all. I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day (it&#x27;s fine textured and non-greasy) and this lasts nicely to a second or third day. I have medium brown hair, with a red tinge from dying it myself with home dye (I use natural medium brown by Garnier) and am would definitely recommend this color over the dark brown unless you really have black/brown hair. This color is much more of a flat medium brown than my hair, but it looks okay at the part/hairline. If you&#x27;re a dark blonde/light brown I think it would be too dark for you.</li>
    <li> I had been using Rita Hazin dark blonde and since this is also a spray &amp; about $10 less I decided to try it. I like the sprays much better than the lipstick looking tubes and mascara looking wands because they are not as sticky or waxy. I got the light to medium Brown since there was only one blonde choice and from others reviews it is probably too light. I have colored dark blonde hair with highlights.  This color is pretty dark but if I brush it through it actually works. I might even like it better because it gives the allusion of more hair! I&#x27;ve had no trouble with it rubbing off. The spray nozzle is just like Rita Hazin&#x27;s brand long and pointed which is good to direct the spray where needed. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is it&#x27;s hard to spray just a little because the spray comes out pretty hard so try to have a light trigger finger if possible! It takes some practice! I will buy again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy to finally find a product that really works for grays. You spray it on and it really does blend in. I used to hate going to work with roots showing and I would try and spread my visits to the salon as far as I could. Now I finally can because this is an amazing product. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Works great.  Be sure to shake well - especially as the container nears empty.</li>
    <li> I have medium brown hair that&#x27;s a little on the darker side. I was on the fence whether I should purchase the medium/light brown or the black/dark brown, but I decided to get the medium/light brown, and I&#x27;m very glad I did. It blends in with my color almost exactly. I should mention that when I fully color my hair, I use Clairol Perfect 10 By Nice &#x27;N Easy Hair Color 005a Medium Ash Brown. So this concealer blends in well with this hair color to cover greys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to be careful, though. When you first start spraying, it comes out quick, very forcefully, and localized, meaning that it will shoot out over a small circular area. That doesn&#x27;t look good because it creates spots of color. It takes a little getting used to and some finesse to get the spray coming out more slowly so that it can spray over a larger area, but I have that down pretty well after just a few sprays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brand is definitely much better than any of those cover sticks or wands.

When I cover my grays, I always do it on wet hair, not dry. I find that it&#x27;s harder and takes much longer doing it on dry hair. When hair is wet, the spray seems to spread over more hair areas a little easier. When done spraying, I comb through my hair. If I see any areas where there&#x27;s too much or too little coverage, I use a wet tissue to spread it on and around those areas. I do get a tiny bit on my hands and face, but not much and it&#x27;s very easy to wipe or wash off. If you do it this way, rubbing it around and combing it through, the coverage is much better and makes it blend nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just bought this so I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last, as the can is on the smaller side (only 2 oz), but I think I will continue buying and using this one no matter what. If there were 1/2 stars to give, I would give it a 4 1/2 instead of a 4. As I mentioned, it does leave a tiny bit of a stickiness on the hair, but it&#x27;s not much. If it left none at all, I would have given it a 5.instead of a 4. As I mentioned, it does leave a tiny bit of a stickiness on the hair, but it&#x27;s not much. If it left none at all, I would have given it a 5.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely amazing! I have dealt with the grey grow line between colorings until finding this product.  A friend mentioned it to me and I thought for under $20 I&#x27;ll try it.  If it works, which I doubt, great, if not, I&#x27;m only out $20.&lt;br /&gt;Well this stuff is awesome.  It is easy to use, matches really well and actually makes the grey look freshly touched up.  The claims are right about it not coming out until washing.  I have sweat, brushed, tousled, and nothing comes out.  This really is an awesome product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been dealing with gray hairs for over a decade now because I have suffered from premature graying since I was a 19-year-old sophomore in college.  I feel like I&#x27;ve tried everything.  This stuff isn&#x27;t bad.  It &amp;#34;stays put&amp;#34; once it dries and does not get all over my hands or pillow.  Also, unlike the powder compact, this spray actually covers the gray instead of just painting your scalp.  I use it for the middle and back of my head, away from the hairline, because it&#x27;s very messy.  Even though it has a narrow nozzle that should help to target a specific area, you have to hold it several inches away from your head because otherwise it will deposit a concentrated blob of color in one small area. Holding it a few inches away from your head allows the color to deposit more evenly, but as a result it winds up all over your face if you try to spray around your hairline.  It ends up looking very messy.  If I cover my forehead with a wash cloth while I spray the front of my head, so much color is deposited onto my scalp that when I remove the washcloth it leaves an overly straight line, and I end up with the Eddie Munster effect.  It just deposits a ton of color onto my scalp, so it&#x27;s very obvious that I&#x27;m using root concealer if I put it near my hairline.  For reference, I don&#x27;t thave thin hair that allows a lot of my scalp to be visible.  I actually have very thick, long hair, so this stuff really does just deposit that much color onto the skin.  So, it&#x27;s fine for the back of my head, or underneath if I want to put my hair up in a high ponytail.  I absolutely never use it on the front of my head near the hairline.  The only type of application that avoids the problem of messy hairlines or too much color deposited onto the scalp is using a wand applicator that looks like a large mascara wand, but I haven&#x27;t yet found one that&#x27;s good.  Most are extremely messy and don&#x27;t stay put, ending up all over my hands if I touch my hair, smearing my skin if I sweat at the gym, or staining my pillow.  I&#x27;ve sort of given up.  Instead, I touch up grays around my hairline with a semi-permenant dye at home in between salon appointments.  I&#x27;ve tried everything else, and nothing looks natural.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this through my hairdresser and loved it.  (She charged me $25.00 for 1 can).  I moved out of state and didn&#x27;t know where I would find this product, but good old Amazon had it!&lt;br /&gt;I can go 8-9 weeks between getting my roots touched up, saving me big bucks!  I only have grey on the top of my head, so after I style my hair, there is usually grey showing in my part.  A couple of quick sprays, no more grey!  Lasts until you shampoo it out, doesn&#x27;t do any damage to hair.  I&#x27;ve been using it about a year or less.</li>
    <li> Good coverage, just hate the feel on my head and cannot wear light colored headbands, color comes off on hair accessories.</li>
    <li> It covers the grays but doesn&#x27;t last til the next wash.</li>
    <li> I have my hair professionaly colored every 4-6 weeks. I have medium brown hair and my new growth is 100% gray at this point.  After 3.5 to 4 weeks, I get what I call my \\&quot;skunk line\\&quot; down my side part.  It&#x27;s ugly and definitely adds years to my appearance.  I&#x27;ve tried those stupid hair color crayons and the stuff in a tube like mascara with no success at all.  My stylist introducted me to Style Edit the last time I was in and it is WONDERFUL!!!  After I blow dry and style, I spray this on my part and temple area and voila...no gray!!  This stuff is worth its weight in gold!</li>
    <li> The five-star rating is for the medium/light shade.  I have used this product for over a year now.  I love it!  It allows me to go another two weeks between colorings..  Here&#x27;s some tips, though.  Get someone else to do it for you and cover the hair you don&#x27;t want colored with an old towel or two.  Don&#x27;t do it over carpet- it sometimes leaks.  I use medium light brown.  I have blonde highlights so I got the blonde color once and it is so ugly!  It&#x27;s a sickly shade of yellow that I don&#x27;t think would work for anyone.  Your part looks awful with this shade.  I would give the blonde shade a zero if I could.</li>
