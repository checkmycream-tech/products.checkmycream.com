### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>These socks work great!  </li>
      <li>These work great.  </li>
      <li>I put these on and they keep my toes feeling great.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They work good</li>
      <li>Too lightweight to be any good.</li>
      <li>Good luck</li>
      <li>Not as effective as toe socks.</li>
      <li>Band aids would work better.</li>
      <li>They keep my toes from touching.</li>
      <li>Junk.&lt;br /&gt;I was able to use it for one time.</li>
      <li>Unravelled a bit after washing but love them.</li>
      <li>But had toe socks not existed, this might have been thought a better product.</li>
      <li>They are easy to wear, and keep your feet comfortable.</li>
      <li>i am wearing them at night to keep the toes of my feet comfortably secure while I sleep.</li>
      <li>They are also comfortable in bed and don&#x27;t come off.</li>
      <li>What happened what the toe separators made my feet even wider to fit into shoes, that is why it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
      <li>if it happens to fit your foot?</li>
      <li>my toes tend to cramp, and this keeps them warm without the heaviness of a full sock, especially in summer</li>
      <li>Feel really good, but I am forever loosing them due to their smallness.</li>
      <li>I was having issues after surgery and looking for something better than medical tape...</li>
      <li>6-Pack (6 Solid Colors) was a better purchase for us.</li>
      <li>If you have  two or more toes rubbing together, you can cut the separator apart to  separate only the troublesome toes.</li>
      <li>They can be used over and over as they wash readily, either by hand or in a washing machine.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see any real value in it at all.  </li>
      <li>Product would not stay in position very long......would not buy again</li>
      <li>Found other products that worked better for me.</li>
      <li>The service was fast and the packaging was appropriate, but the item is not not worth it.</li>
      <li>Effective toe spacer but very hard to correctly install and harder to remove and clean.</li>
      <li>I have a couple of favorite shoes that have stretched out a little to much.</li>
      <li>Waste of money cheap quality and do not stay on........</li>
      <li>This is cheaply made, hard to put on and when you wash it (as it says you can)</li>
      <li>Okay if I wear socks over it but wish they were a little longer down the foot.</li>
      <li>So small they have to be stretched to fit and bounce off your foot.</li>

    <li> Product would not stay in position very long......would not buy again</li>
    <li> Have a little trouble staying on the foot, especially on the pinky toe end.  Okay if I wear socks over it but wish they were a little longer down the foot.</li>
    <li> Did not fit. (to small). not very well made. Went to the trash.</li>
    <li> I have a couple of favorite shoes that have stretched out a little to much. I put these on and they keep my toes feeling great.</li>
    <li> They are a little small for my feet, but I noticed that they had a soothing effect in keeping my toes seperated &#x27; They are also comfortable in bed and don&#x27;t come off.</li>
    <li> Unravelled a bit after washing but love them.</li>
    <li> Not for me, they are too petit!</li>
    <li> This is cheaply made, hard to put on and when you wash it (as it says you can) it comes apart.</li>
    <li> Feel really good, but I am forever loosing them due to their smallness.</li>
    <li> This appliance (and that is what this is) Does what it should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used to separate and straighten &amp;#34;twisty toes&amp;#34; while sleeping.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay in place and is difficult to get your toes into it. Moves around in your shoes a lot</li>
    <li> this product keeps sliding off of my toes and this is useless because if its separating from my toes it can not separate my toes.</li>
    <li> The toe separator is too short to begin with and then bunches up.  The result being the toes are not separated.  I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Poorly made.  Does not do what they  say they do.</li>
    <li> The product is made of a flimsy material that lacks the strength to keep the toes separated.  On the plus side it can be worn with footwear.  NO at all what I expected.</li>
    <li> I had to give a 4.&lt;br /&gt;They work good so I like them, My dislike is that longer up my foot, 3/4 to 1. in would be better.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend them.</li>
    <li> These work great.  They stay in place.</li>
    <li> my toes tend to cramp, and this keeps them warm without the heaviness of a full sock, especially in summer</li>
    <li> Thought it was thicker</li>
    <li> Junk.&lt;br /&gt;I was able to use it for one time. Can not recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;How could the company produce such poor quality product and have enough conscious to sell it?</li>
    <li> Not as effective as toe socks. RSG Hosiery Men&#x27;s &amp; Women&#x27;s Toe Socks 6-Pack (6 Solid Colors) was a better purchase for us. But had toe socks not existed, this might have been thought a better product. My son wished they were either shorter (before the ball of the foot) or longer (covered the ball of the foot), or maybe just 3 or 4 holes to separate the toes without encasing both sides (since he wears them with socks anyway).</li>
    <li> I had to return this because it didn&#x27;t do what i expected it to do. I have wide feet, and i get blisters between my toes, so i was hoping that with this product i would get some separation between my toes. What happened what the toe separators made my feet even wider to fit into shoes, that is why it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Waste of money cheap quality and do not stay on........</li>
    <li> I have hammer toes really bad and they bugged me at night while I was trying to sleep.  These socks work great!  They keep my toes from touching.</li>
    <li> Same thing with these socks way to small for people that have big feet like myself.</li>
    <li> Serves no purpose.Band aids would work better.</li>
    <li> If your toes rub together, these toe separator socks can prevent mutual rubbing.  And once put on, they don&#x27;t slip off, as do some other designed to separate toes.  They can be used over and over as they wash readily, either by hand or in a washing machine.  If there is any fault with them, it is that they are a little difficult to put on, to slip on each toe. If you have  two or more toes rubbing together, you can cut the separator apart to  separate only the troublesome toes. The difficulty in putting on all five of them in why they don&#x27;t merit five stars.</li>
    <li> Too lightweight to be any good. So small they have to be stretched to fit and bounce off your foot. Very thin. Like the toe part of a doll stocking.</li>
    <li> I thought these would work well but when I received them I was not impressed with the quality - and they were to big for my foot.  Jesus&#x27; Blessings and Peace</li>
    <li> Not sure what this actually is, but it is not any sort of separator.  I was having issues after surgery and looking for something better than medical tape...I will keep looking.  This is not even as thick as sock material.  I don&#x27;t see any real value in it at all.  The service was fast and the packaging was appropriate, but the item is not not worth it.</li>
    <li> Shows when wearing shoes and difficult to get all toes through the slips.</li>
    <li> THIS WAS THE POOREST QUALITY OF ANYTHING I HAVE EVER SEEN.  COST $3.00 FOR SHIPPING - SHOULD HAVE BEEN 49 CENTS.  SENT IT BACK TO AMAZON.I WOULD NOT TRUST ANYTHING FROM MILES KIMBAL AGAIN.</li>
    <li> I like the thin aspect of the sock, but the elastic is beginning to roll and this defeats the purpose. Still will try to wear them because they separate my toes enough at night where they were hurting since they were so close together.</li>
    <li> The Toe socks keeps my toes from running together when walking.  For my needs they work; but they are very thin.</li>
    <li> They are easy to wear, and keep your feet comfortable. i am wearing them at night to keep the toes of my feet comfortably secure while I sleep.</li>
    <li> I did not like this product at all . . . it never stayed on my feet. Good luck if it happens to fit your foot? Very thin, flimsy material, and didn&#x27;t cover enough to stay on.</li>
    <li> Effective toe spacer but very hard to correctly install and harder to remove and clean. Found other products that worked better for me.</li>
