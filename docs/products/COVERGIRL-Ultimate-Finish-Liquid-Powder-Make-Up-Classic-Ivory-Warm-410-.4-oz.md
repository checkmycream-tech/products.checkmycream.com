    <li> This is a great color. I am somewhat pale with pink undertones, but this color works really well for me and doesn&#x27;t make me look washed out.

But now that I have tried Aqua Smooth, I do notice a little difference.</li>
    <li> Color looks perfect to my fair complexion skin tone but when I put it on the color became too light that I looked like a ghost.  So I returned it and ordered Buff Beige.</li>
    <li> works really well and of course so easy to apply.  Mess free.</li>
    <li> I have worn this product for years and anytime I have ventured away, it did not take long for me to return to it. So easy to apply, dries almost immediately and has good coverage without looking heavy. It is definitely my favorite.</li>
    <li> Purchase for my wife ,pleased with product and would purchase again</li>
    <li> I loved this! It&#x27;s not easy to take it out of the compact and I like that because it lasts longer than the other versions of this. I use a powder after applying this and my face is flawless! The liquid powder lasts longer that just a powder by its self and my freckles and my wrinkles are almost unnoticeable. I will be buying this again and again!</li>

    <li> This is my favorite light cover up for smoothing out facial skin color.  I only use a little and it lasts a long time.  No one can tell I&#x27;m wearing makeup.  I do use a slight blush over it, and I&#x27;m done and looking good.  I&#x27;m 75 yrs. old and people compliment me on my complexion all the time, and I know that Cover Girl gets part of the credit for this - that and good genes!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I can&#x27;t seem to find it in local stores anymore.  Good coverage. Doesn&#x27;t cake or feel heavy.</li>
    <li> Must be a closeout. Worked just fine</li>
    <li> My everyday makeup and very affordable.</li>
    <li> I have used this color in this brand in all different forms - cream to powder, mousse, liquid, etc. and I like them all.  Will continue to use it - I don&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> I love this product and wish I could find it locally.  I think it&#x27;s being discontinued.</li>
    <li> Only issue was it was darker then expected.  Great for the vaule</li>
    <li> This is a product that I have used for a year or more but had not been able to find the color I needed locally.  It is easy to apply comes&lt;br /&gt;in enough shades or colors to match any skin tone.</li>
