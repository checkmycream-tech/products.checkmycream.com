      <li>Has a lot of colors, good pigments.</li>
      <li>The eyeshadows are fairly pigmented and the blushes and bronzer are nice.  </li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>LOVE e.l.f.!</li>
      <li>The makeup palette itself is nice.  </li>
      <li>Oo my God this is cute and of a good quality.</li>
      <li>The shape it arrived in, not so nice.  </li>
      <li>fair or light skin and auburn hair and these colors give me a summery, sun kissed look.</li>
      <li>Good color payoff and smooth application.</li>
      <li>though I&#x27;ve gotten more utility out of the bottom tray than I thought I would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love the eyeshadow selections and the blushes.</li>
      <li>I love  the bronzer and the blushes.</li>
      <li>The colors went as pigmented as I had hoped and many are neutrals.</li>
      <li>what else a woman want :)</li>
      <li>I love the eyeshadows and the blush but the lup gloss and face shimmer</li>
      <li>The shipping box looked fine.  </li>
      <li>This would be great for a younger person</li>
      <li>cheap made.</li>
      <li>Its really worth it, cute travel makeup...</li>
      <li>(white powder on the right) is VERY bright and shimmery, so apply with caution.</li>
      <li>and I am not disappointed.</li>
      <li>I originally rated this a 4 but after using it for a couple of months, I give it a 5.  </li>
      <li>It is perfect for travel, the only things its missing truly are just your foundation routine eyeliner and mascara, and better lip stuff if you like better color.</li>
      <li>good for  gifts to put on goody-bag, i would personally not use on my skin tho..</li>
      <li>I love this, the colors are shockingly very pigmented.</li>
      <li>E.L.F&#x27;s eyebrow products have good reviews online, and they&#x27;re probably the same stuff.</li>
      <li>Bought this for my teenage daughter (a make-up guru) - she was very pleased.  </li>
      <li>This is a great little compact.</li>
      <li>i don&#x27;t  really use but overall good product</li>
      <li>It was worth the $15 I paid.</li>
      <li>I use it everyday and loving having so many options all in one case.</li>
      <li>Case itself is nice, arrived in tact, nothing cracked or broken and is a good travel size.  </li>
      <li>The compact looks fairly matte in the photos, but most of them are shimmery-- not overwhelmingly so, again, very practical.</li>
      <li>The price is right too.</li>
      <li>Too many dark colors but color stays on after many hours.  </li>
      <li>are completely not as shown in photo which show soft rose, peach, pinks, but mine is super bright pink, nothing like photo.</li>
      <li>Most likely would not purchase again.</li>
      <li>I was going to give this five stars on principle, as I only purchased it for the eyeshadows-- which are absolutely great, and totally worth the minimal investment.</li>
      <li>Also, shadow color of top left which looks frosty white is not there and is more nude color.</li>
      <li>Fun first makeup kit for my 10 year old</li>
      <li>Not to mention, the component is very simple and easy to use.</li>
      <li>I really like it.</li>
      <li>I really like it.  </li>
      <li>But for people who purchased it for the whole kit and caboodle, I guess it leaves something to be</li>
      <li>Very pigmented and blendable.</li>
      <li>Are really just glosses or balms.</li>
      <li>Still, the blues and greens are really brought and those are very pigmented.</li>
      <li>The colors arevery sheer, and you&#x27;d have to apply a BUNCH of them to get any significant pigment.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Eyeshadows: Vibrant (lots of concentrated pigment), and very wearable.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little more &amp;#34;pink&amp;#34; than I would typically use for my skin tone, but applied with a very light hand, it&#x27;s pretty wearable.</li>
      <li>I buy ELF products because they don&#x27;t test on animals and the quality is high.  </li>
      <li>Bottom row, far right and 2nd to far right) Couldn&#x27;t tell you anything about these, I haven&#x27;t worn them.</li>
      <li>Eyelipsface.com has this same clutch for $10.00 right now.</li>
      <li>The 2nd to the right however, is NOT sheer.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re somewhere in the medium brunette range, they&#x27;re likely decent, though.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s not bad for everyday use.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s actually TOO sheer to be of real use, you have to pile on quite a bit for it to be visible.</li>
      <li>, it looked WAY too dark for my face (like dirt on top of my typically &amp;#34;porcelain&amp;#34; shade), so I thought it would sit untouched.</li>
      <li>I like the face shimmee, but it doesnt lie it is very shimmery and shiny, so use carefully.</li>
      <li>I like using the bright middle-column shades as a liner, with the very wearable/neutral shimmer shades (left side columns) as a base.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t imagine I&#x27;ll use it much, and if I do, it would be UNDER my typical foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lip colors:</li>

<li> It&#x27;s really pigmented, a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> My final test was that you can use them wet to enhance the pigment tone and work them like liquid eyeliner-- some eyeshadows get really hard and unusable after you get them wet (looking at you, Clinique!), but these are fine.</li>
<li> This is a quite a bit larger than I expected....</li>
<li> Am disappointed by the size of this..much smaller than I thought it would be, more like a &amp;#34;sample&amp;#34; pack..size of lipsticks are really tiny and with use, will not last long..also have very little color pigment, nothing like color shown..almost like a clear gloss....colors of blush and one shadow</li>

<li> I use more expensive makeup as a base for this and that made a big difference in how much it lasted.  </li>
<li> But it&#x27;s actually really sheer, so I&#x27;ve used it a few times!</li>
<li> So, wearable, but not useful if you want color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Also the contouring color is pretty orange and the highlighter is a cream which I found a bit awkward to apply.</li>

    <li> Was not what I expected. Ended up giving it away.</li>
    <li> The makeup palette itself is nice.  The shape it arrived in, not so nice.  The shipping box looked fine.  The inner box that this palette was in was all broken and misshapen.  As such, there was a broken eye shadow and it was all over the place.  This is a gift so, I am disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love the eyeshadows and the blush but the lup gloss and face shimmer i don&#x27;t  really use but overall good product</li>
    <li> This is a great little compact. It is perfect for travel, the only things its missing truly are just your foundation routine eyeliner and mascara, and better lip stuff if you like better color. the eyeshadows ar great, i do reccomend wearing a primer or foundation on your eyelids though, to prevent some fallout. But otherwise these are great! Very pigmented and blendable. I love  the bronzer and the blushes. The eyebrow powder and cream are great too. I like the face shimmee, but it doesnt lie it is very shimmery and shiny, so use carefully. the lip glosses do add some color to your lips nnd some shine. I hope this helps!</li>
    <li> Eyelipsface.com has this same clutch for $10.00 right now. Great buy!</li>
    <li> Christmas gift for my niece arrived unbroken or damaged. Plenty of colors in this palette to choose from and all kept together!</li>
    <li> Great colors. I have fair or light skin and auburn hair and these colors give me a summery, sun kissed look. Good color payoff and smooth application. I bought this while shopping for a makeup palette to take with me while traveling so that everything would be together and I am not disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is very good! I use it all the time! This is a MUST BUY item. It&#x27;s really awesome and color is great. You can&#x27;t beat the price! Not to mention, the component is very simple and easy to use. LOVE e.l.f.!</li>
    <li> The colors went as pigmented as I had hoped and many are neutrals. Also the contouring color is pretty orange and the highlighter is a cream which I found a bit awkward to apply. Still, the blues and greens are really brought and those are very pigmented. I would buy again.</li>

But it&#x27;s actually really sheer, so I&#x27;ve used it a few times! Buildable and subtle. The 2nd left shade is a blush, I think? It&#x27;s actually TOO sheer to be of real use, you have to pile on quite a bit for it to be visible. The 2nd to the right however, is NOT sheer. It&#x27;s really pigmented, a little goes a long way.

They look medium-to-dark-brown, and I have flaming red hair, so I don&#x27;t think it would have ended well. If you&#x27;re somewhere in the medium brunette range, they&#x27;re likely decent, though. E.L.F&#x27;s eyebrow products have good reviews online, and they&#x27;re probably the same stuff.</li>
    <li> Its really worth it, cute travel makeup...what else a woman want :)</li>
    <li> Great item for the price</li>

    <li> Too many dark colors but color stays on after many hours.  Difficult to figure out to open the first time.</li>
    <li> I like it.    The eyeshadows are fairly pigmented and the blushes and bronzer are nice.  I&#x27;m not sure what the face shimmer is for (I figured out that I can use it for contouring on my cheekbones which I only use at evening or night) or the two strange creams, meant for my eyebrows.  This would be great for a younger person but it&#x27;s not bad for everyday use.  I use more expensive makeup as a base for this and that made a big difference in how much it lasted.  I teach and my eyeshadow is still on by the end of the day.  I originally rated this a 4 but after using it for a couple of months, I give it a 5.  I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s but I don&#x27;t mind using cheaper eyeshadows and lip glosses that can be layered over more expensive products.  It was worth the $15 I paid.</li>
    <li> I love this, the colors are shockingly very pigmented. The bronzer for me is perfect to contour. I will repurchase this. It fits perfectly in my purse and has everything I need in it.</li>
    <li> This is a quite a bit larger than I expected....wanted to use it in my makeup case in my carry on but decided against it.</li>
    <li> Oo my God this is cute and of a good quality.I really like it.</li>
    <li> excellent seller, item as described</li>
    <li> good for  gifts to put on goody-bag, i would personally not use on my skin tho..cheap made.</li>
    <li> I really like it.  The colors are great for most everyone and it is so great for traveling.  I use it everyday and loving having so many options all in one case. Love it!</li>
    <li> Fun first makeup kit for my 10 year old</li>
    <li> Bought this for my teenage daughter (a make-up guru) - she was very pleased.  I buy ELF products because they don&#x27;t test on animals and the quality is high.  The price is right too.</li>
