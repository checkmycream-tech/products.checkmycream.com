      <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t seem to be as effective as just Miconazole, which is a component of this product.  </li>
      <li>But that is just me it may be effective for others</li>

      <li>Large bottle and great price.</li>
      <li>What more can I say.  </li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t make the problem (which was coming form the inside) go away, but it make the burning, cracked skin, and itching much more tolerable.</li>

      <li>Been using this for a couple of years and always been satisfied with it.</li>
      <li>Better than the RX product per doctor.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I purchased this to treat my Tinea Versicolor.  The product is scentless (unlike many other products for my condition) and doesn&#x27;t need rinsed off.  After only a few uses I am seeing my patches fade.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Good product for incontinent men subject to frequent urinary tract infections. It is way to use. It is easy to clean up.</li>
    <li> Quick arrival &amp; as advertized.</li>
    <li> Shipped promptly and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  What more can I say.  Been using this for a couple of years and always been satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> If you have need for this product, it works. I guess I don&#x27;t understand the purpose of reviewing the product I purchased.</li>
    <li> Best product for redness and irritation of genital/anal area, ie yeast infection, in elderly who must wear depends or similar product. It offers protection from wetness and treatment of yeast infection. Have used this product for more than 20 years, it was our go-to skin care product when I worked in home care, and never been disappointed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great antifungal moisture barrier cream to heal skin and to keep it from having problems in the first place.</li>
    <li> Came timely. Just as I expected.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I didn&#x27;t really notice a strong odor at all. It is very thick though. Doesn&#x27;t really absorb well in to the skin like a lotion. The instructions do say apply a small amount.</li>
    <li> My perineal rash is something really evil that widely available OTC topical anti-fungals including Baza (miconazole nitrate) can&#x27;t touch. In fact, something in Baza seems to aggravate it. Zinc Oxide ointment USP, which is similar to Baza but dead-simple in formulation with no antifungal ingredients, gave me some relief, but Baza made things worse.  After much creativity and thought and an incredible number of experiments, what I finally worked for me is internal anti-fungal treatment (evidently I have a systemic problem) consisting of large doses of oregano oil and goldenseal. Oregano oil also helped externally but was incredibly harsh on the perineum, where its use is actually a no-no.   update 2015: after writing the above I found out what was wrong with me: inverse psoriasis, which is essentially diaper rash in adults and results from Candida albicans running amok for some reason. Topical treatments do not work for this problem, but oral fluconazole sure does!</li>
    <li> Baza cream is the best I have tried.  My 93 year old mother is wheelchair bound and also incontinent.  Many times  she will start to develop bed sores and other sores from wearing disposable pants.  I use the Baza cream and it clears it up right away while providing a barrier against having wet pants.</li>
    <li> Worked perfectly as described and for the money you get a large supple. Can be drying so monitor that, but this product was as everyone has described.</li>
    <li> There are so many of these types of products, it&#x27;s hard to choose which one to buy !!?? I&#x27;m glad I bought this one !! Although, it&#x27;s probably more than I&#x27;ll ever need !! Works good and smells nice. I would not hesitate to buy it again.</li>
    <li> If you have any place where skin touches skin, you need this product.  I had a heat rash, used different powders and creams and then ordeed Baza.  It goes on as a cream and places a barrier between the skin to skin allowing your skin to heal.  Mostly use it at night but have been putting some on in the a.m. when I know the day is going to be hot and humid.</li>
    <li> This cleared up my 7 month old baby&#x27;s yeast diaper rash in 2 1/2 days. I was using something else and it worked but it was super expensive. When I saw that this had the same ingredients and I could get more of it at a cheaper price I figured I would try it. I&#x27;m so glad I did. I&#x27;ll be using this from now on.</li>
    <li> Tried 10 other products - this one actually worked and doesn&#x27;t have that nasty medical smell - actually smells good.</li>
    <li> Since I exercise every day, I occasionally get jock itch. With this cream I can effectively treat it and keep it under control. It is not a cure, but it keeps it in check.</li>
    <li> I am giving the cream some time to see how effective it is.</li>
    <li> If you need zinc oxide with miconazole nitrate added to cure or prevent fungal infections --- then this is the product for you.  Because its a creme, this product is not as opaque as Desitin Zinc Oxide Ointment that is easily found and commonly used on babies to prevent babies diaper rash.  This is Zinc Oxide with 2% Miconazole Nitrate added  --- Very hard or impossible to find, in local pharmacies, it&#x27;s nice to have it available here on Amazon.  Very good product to protect the skin from moisture and fungal rash and can be used on babies, teenagers, or adults. Excellent Value. Fast Shipping.</li>
    <li> I had some type of black fungus on my nipples due to sweat and moist. It was very painful and irritating. I was desperate about finding the solution. I couldn&#x27;t afford to go to a doctor office because I didn&#x27;t have health insurance. I read some article online and they suggested to put on some anti-fungal cream. I purchased this product because of its high ratings and it didn&#x27;t let me down. The first two or three trials didn&#x27;t seem to work that well, but after a week of continuously trying, the result eventually showed up. The cream helped to prevent the growth of the fungus because it blocked out the unnecessary moist. Also, it loosened the previous dots and made them easy to wash out during showers. Now, my breast is healing and there is no sign of coming back symptoms. The bottle is very big and sufficient so you can use it in various other occasions with associated fungus infections. I don&#x27;t like to write reviews but couldn&#x27;t help to say good things about this product. Love it. If you have the same problem like I do, this is worth a try.</li>
    <li> Maybe it is because it was warm the few days I used it, but it kept my skin damp even though I made sure my skin was dry after bathing before I put it on.  By the third day my skin had broken  out so I went back to using powder/cornstarch.</li>
    <li> This cream does just exactly what it says.  A neighbor is a nurse and works at a nursing home, she recommended this cream, they use it at the home.  It&#x27;s great for summer rash and other little private itches and such, and smells really fresh.  I would recommend this cream.</li>
    <li> Best stuff ever!  I have had an ongoing issue with darkness and chafing under breasts - I had no idea that it was a fungus.  My doctor had told me because it is perpetually moist under breasts there is nothing that could be done.  I tried powders and diaper rash ointments hoping to keep the moisture at bay but it did not help.  I used Baza antifungul cream and after the 2nd use noticed a huge difference.  Within a month the darkness is hardly noticeable - for the first time in 10 years, itching, chafing and dark skin gone.</li>
    <li> I have finally found the answer to my problem of chafing from sweating. This works great in the areas I needed it. I will buy more as needed.</li>
    <li> I became very ill a few years ago after a medication suppressed my immune system a bit too much. I&#x27;d been occasionally having a fungal infection on the side of my neck. It didn&#x27;t bother me and it came and went, but stayed about the size of a quarter, and wasn&#x27;t noticeable nor did it itch. Unfortunately, it ended up spreading down my neck, to my underarms, and across my chest. As it spread, it drove me crazy with itching. Due to a number of problems on top of the chronic diseases I already had, the new issues such as sepsis, UTIs, etc. caused me to end up hospitalized, unable to walk, and living with incontinence. Needless to say, my skin was also broke out because of the briefs, but since I had the fungal rash, it was thought that it had spread. A combination of fungal infections of the skin plus heat rash is not comfortable when you are bed-bound. I&#x27;d been transferred to a nursing home and the one I was in took it seriously to try to get that rash cleared up.  Between fever and hot flashes I seemed to be constantly broke out. We later found out I was also having a reaction to a certain brand of briefs, go figure. That shocked many people since, as the rep from the brief company told me, \\&quot;We use only hypo-allergenic products.\\&quot; Well, I can&#x27;t help it that I have an immune system that is messed up because of medications but their hypo-allergenic briefs caused me a lot of pain! Once we switched to a different brand of brief, the problem was much better. I still had the fungal problems on my skin and had to watch for heat rash but those are normal for someone in my situation. It took a combination of Baza Moisture Barrier with Anti-fungal Cream combined with a prescription anti-fungal cream and/or powder (we found at times I healed faster with powder and others the cream was better). We also confirmed that part of the trouble was the irritation from a specific brand of brief once the fungal rash cleared up. We tried the brand of brief I&#x27;d reacted to before to make sure it really was a reaction. Within 2hrs my skin felt like it was on fire and the nurse confirmed the presence of a major rash where there had not been one before. I had large hive-like splotches that were raised up, not to mention the burning and itching that occurred.  It took 2 weeks to clear that up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite progressing enough to return home, I still must use briefs. Since I couldn&#x27;t find Baza locally, I figured I&#x27;d just use some brand of diaper rash cream. It was less expensive, easier to just get it at the store etc. But, I have decided lately, after the heat of the summer really set off some discomfort that I didn&#x27;t care if it was more expensive, I was going to order the Baza because I know it worked so well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not having much success with this curing and controlling jock itch. It has a pleasant aroma and applies more like a hand lotion than an ointment. The active ingredient is 2% Miconazole Nitrate. I have had great success with Ting, active ingredient Tolnaftate 1%. I tried this because I was looking for something a little more economical with a soothing feel. But the Baza cream gets good reviews from others, so I&#x27;m thinking this is a cream/ointment that does work, just not for me.</li>
    <li> Great foot cream, but a bit messy...I would probably purchase a foot powder next time. However, it did help to get read of the fungus for my son and there for I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> One use and I can feel a difference already. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product to yeast problems. It is better than the prescriptions I have been given. It is odorless and very convenient to use. A must have...</li>
    <li> I have issues with getting rashes-this made it much worse.  Lotriman for her is the only thing that works for me.  I just use it for a few days when my rash appears.</li>
    <li> 2nd Review. I bought this for my Tinea Versicolar and I woke up the next day with a big difference and since then i&#x27;ve seen a dramatic change....NOW, I&#x27;m loving this product because I accidently found that it has cleared up blimeshes and discolorations from pimples on my face and chest...it stopped my face from being super oily ( so I no longer have to continue to retouch my make-up) my skin tone is almost even and I couldn&#x27; t be happier. Repeat purchaser, right here.</li>
    <li> ABSOLUTELY the cure for a bacterial breast rash or a rash due to workout clothes irritating the skin.  This stuff is amazing.  Cleared up a rash within a week that had been reoccurring for 2+ months.  Love this stuff.  I have been telling everyone I know how great it is.</li>
    <li> Leaving 4 stars because I just got the cream on time today. Will come back in 4-6 weeks to let you guys know if it has been effective or not. If it is effective, will leave 5 stars instead of 4.</li>
    <li> Everything done as they promise.</li>
    <li> Very happy to find this product online! I checked several local pharmacies, and none of them carried it. The price seemed a little high, but I bought it anyways since it was my only option.</li>
    <li> This product was used at the hospital and worked well so ordered more to use at home I even reordered when I ran out.</li>
    <li> Since it has 7 months old, my daughter suffered from fungi in the diaper area. I took her to the pediatrician and he prescribed a mixture of Nystatin, Aquaphor and Desitin. It worked for a while and then was returning the fungus. In addition to this mixture cost me over a hundred dollars, did not work at all. I decided to buy this cream and it was a miracle. Besides the work immediately, the fungus has not returned and cost me less than $ 15. I still have more than half of the cream because I had to use was minimal. From the best products I have purchased in my life.</li>
    <li> THIS WORKS WELL TO PREVENT A RASH IN HOT WEATHER WHERE SKIN FOLDS EXIST.  I CAN HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I;ve tried other products of this type.  For the price this works.  It&#x27;s a very thick, I just cover the area instead of completely rubbing into my skin.  Will be buying again.</li>
    <li> Not very effective for me the active ingredient seemed to be in too less concentration to be effective. But that is just me it may be effective for others</li>
    <li> this is a two for one product. it prevents irritation caused by sweat or urine seepage and fights any yeast that may be in the area at the same.  as a diabetic I appreciate killing two birds with one effective product</li>
    <li> If any of you have ever had children this product feels and smells alot like desitin.  Slap in a little antifungal and bam you have a great product!  I have used all of the products I can find and this one is one of the best.  It is long lasting and effective.  If you have dry cracked skin or have scratched a bit too much it may burn a little upon application but that is to be expected I suppose.  It comes in a much larger volume than most competitors which is nice.  I would recommend this product to anyone trying to find a solution to that itch, but make sure you try them all to find the one that works for you!</li>
    <li> I had a mysterious rash on my Rear (crack) for atleast 6 months. It felt like athletes foot; it looked like a diaper rash; one doctor thought it was 5 different skin conditions and test cultures came back with 7 different mysterious results (no diseases)...which lead me to a fortune of prescriptions . Another doctor had his own opinion and recommended more prescription meds &amp; treatments. I researched every rash on the internet and tested out as many over-the-counter treatments as I could find (soaps, creams, everything!). Additionally, I changed my diet and tried natural remedies too. I suspected, through all my research, that I get a skin rash called Intertrigo.&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eventually, I came across this product on Amazon. Already, many dollars in debt and my booty still hurting, I purchased \\&quot;PediFix-TeaTree Ultimates-FungaSoap\\&quot; &amp; \\&quot;Baza-Moiture Barrier Antifungal Cream.\\&quot; Whatever the reason this has happened to me, sweating during exercise, chaffing panties, hormonal imbalances..I&#x27;m prone to this skin condition. THE ONLY PRODUCTS THAT NOT ONLY HELPED, THEY CLEARED UP MY RASH were \\&quot;PediFix-TeaTree Ultimates-FungaSoap\\&quot; &amp; \\&quot;Baza-Moiture Barrier Antifungal Cream.\\&quot; I HONESTLY &amp; HIGHLY recommend these 2 products!!! I use both as preventative treatments now. I also read that \\&quot;Zeasorb AF powder\\&quot; works great for this so I&#x27;ll be buying that too.&lt;br /&gt;Burrows solution did not work and the Domburro powder I ordered never arrived (don&#x27;t waste time there!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The doctors didn&#x27;t help me. I had to be my own advocate and research my own symptoms and cure. These 2 products are the only treatments that helped me!</li>
    <li> The cream works fine I guess but the best thing I found is a spray anti-fungal.  Really does the job!</li>
    <li> Exactly what was needed.</li>
    <li> My mother had a stroke and frequently has rashes, skin irritations from being wheelchair bound.  This cream is the perfect antidote for those areas.  Does not irritate, easy to clean and doesn&#x27;t stain.  Excellent solution in more ways than one.</li>
    <li> We use this faithfully to prevent bedsores on a bedridden patient who is incontinent.  The barrier cream really protects the skin from breaking down!</li>
    <li> Excellent product - no stain as in the original yellow one.  Fast delivery. I am ordering more.    thanks,  brian</li>
    <li> For someone else but worked great</li>
    <li> I was bedridden for a few months and developed a rash under one of my breasts. After talking to my mom, who cared for my grandmother after a surgery, she told me about this product. A few weeks of consistent use/keeping the area dry made the rash go away. (I had seen the rash before, but ignored it). I had to spend a weekend in the hospital a few weeks ago and it immediately came back because I was sweating profusely, not bathing regularly, and not wearing the proper undergarments.&lt;br /&gt;So, I came home and began using this again. I couldn&#x27;t be happier. It saved me a visit to the doctor and got rid of the uncomfortable and embarrassing rash.</li>
    <li> I tried this and it worked as promised so I reordered and will continue as needed.  Not much more to say.</li>
    <li> I was dissappointed in this product. It had the same ingredients as products that cost much less. The only advantage is that this cream is silkier and is easier to apply and wash from your hands afterwards.</li>
    <li> This is the only cream that will work for my husband. Works so well that we have ordered it twice!</li>
    <li> HI, I have tinea versicular and this stuff does exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to do. It works faster than anything else I have used and I&#x27;ve used prescription stuff from the doctor and even made my own lotion out of coconut oil, lavender, and tea tree oils. If you have a fungal problem I suggest giving this a try.</li>
    <li> I have tried a number of products on jock itch. I do not believe there is any such thing as a &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34;. I showered thoroughly, dried completely, as per  the instructions, and applied a layer of this Baza.  It did provide some comfort but did not remove all of the itch. So far I have found powder to be the better product than cream to provide better itch relief. The only down side to powder is that it is a tad messier than cream. My search for the perfect solution continues but until I find the ultimate product  I will continue to use this Baza which serves me well if not perfectly.</li>
    <li> I tried every baby cream I could get my hands on to clear up my 7 month old daughter&#x27;s rash. Nothing worked. I came to Amazon praying they had something that *might* work (I was doubtful and desperate). This took care of it in less than 3 days!!! I&#x27;m so excited! She feels better, I can stop worrying and it was QUICK. One tube will last me forever with how little I had to use. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Works very well.  I got immediate results after the very first use!  I plan to continue to use it daily.</li>
    <li> I have used this product in the past and for its intended purpose it is great and I will continue to use but what is the difference between the green top tube and the blue top tube..?  Are they the same or are they used for different purposes?</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way with this product.  It&#x27;s very thick, and a little medicinal smelling.  But man...this has changed my world!  I live in a hot place, and year-long I have skin irritations pretty much anywhere I bend :) (TMI?)  But this in conjunction with PediFix FungaSoap Cleansing Wash got rid of everything in 2 weeks...something prescription meds, steroid ointments and lots of other stuff wasn&#x27;t able to do.  Now I&#x27;m in maintenance mode, and hope things never go back the way they were.</li>
    <li> I have battled intertrigo on and off for many years (more than a decade). So much so, that my skin had turned a permanent darker color in that area (or so I thought). I generaly prefer more natural treatments and have tried just about every treatment (natural or not) out there including prescription creams from the doctor. Some would help but nothing cured the issue. Until I tried this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it continually for a month and the discoloration that I had thought was permanent went away! The redness, pain, itching and swelling and yeasty smell (ewww, I know, but I am putting myself out there in hopes this will help someone else) ~ GONE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because this is an issue of skin touching skin, in a hot/moist area, I have had a reoccurance but this cream Cured it again. The thing is to use the cream and then you must keep the area dry in order to stop the rash from returning at a later date after stopping use. Good luck! I hope it helps you as well as it has helped me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(as a side note, a diet lower in carbs will help stop it from returning as well)</li>
    <li> wonderful product - use daily in folds after swimming. No more rash, itching and smell. always will some on hand</li>
    <li> I used this to help with rash and irritation in genital area and it worked! Another plus the generous size of the product and the ease of using it.</li>
    <li> This works great especially if you have an area of skin that is more sensitive (under breast irritation). It cools down, stops itchyness, redness, &amp; prevents fungal growth.</li>
    <li> 2% Miconazole Nitrate is not listed as an active ingredient on the package that I received which looks different from what is shown.</li>
    <li> I use this product quite a bit.  I am female and prone to vaginal fungus situations.  I do not use daily of course - but after one yeast infection I have not had a recurrence.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t last very long so frequent application is required</li>
    <li> This cream was a miracle for me. Had a light fungal infection on my chest and this cleared it up overnight!</li>
    <li> Smell is not horrible and it applies nicely (be sure to wear gloves), BUT, it does not last as long as some others.  Also will be hard to get out of your clothes, so be aware.  It does the trick, though for only a short time.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> I was amazed at how quickly this relieves irritation.  It is a thick cream and stays put, so you don&#x27;t have to reapply continually.  Love to find an OTC product that works this quickly.</li>
    <li> So I had this weird red patch of skin about 1 inch in diameter in a not so flattering place...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t do anything about it for a long time because it didn&#x27;t really cause me any physical distress, other than the sight of it. Well I recently started dating someone and decided I needed to take care of this before I did the no pants dance This stuff cleared it up in a little over a week. I still use it occasionally, but not everyday. The smell isn&#x27;t bad at all and a little goes a long way. If you&#x27;re wondering, my dance went off without a hitch.</li>
    <li> It is almost too soon to give a proper review, but I do use this in combination with the Lady Anti-Monkey Butt powder to keep dry under breast area and cleavage as well as upper thigh crease area.  The combination seems to work, just waiting to see what the long-term benefits are.  Has a very nice smell.</li>
    <li> This is excellent product and is not easy to find in stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is the best product for yeast problem under breast folds I have ever found</li>
    <li> Our hospice nurse recommended this when my father had to wear diapers.  It worked better than any other product. We are very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> No effect. Waste of money !</li>
    <li> I use this to prevent bedsores on her bony tailbone area for my bedridden mother. It helps a lot, applied very thick, almost like a cushion. The only downside is that over a period of time it seems to dry the skin and some time off from it is needed.</li>
    <li> Helped treat a yeast/fungus infection on a male in the (you know where) place which developed due to excessive sugars in the urine from diabetic medications I was using  Also helped with Angular cheilitis outbreak. Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> this stuff is great....i am very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> Out of all the anti fungal creams and lotions I&#x27;ve tried, this one is my least favorite to apply.&lt;br /&gt;It really is a diaper rash cream so it goes on thick and greasy and stays there. However I have tinea versicolor in my breast area and it&#x27;s already too warm and itchy. So when I apply this cream it feels like it&#x27;s holding in all the heat, sweat and itchiness. So when I need some quick relief from itchiness, the Baza cream does not give it. Also I have to let the cream air out  to dry a lot longer (compared to a lotion) before I can put on my clothing,&lt;br /&gt;Also, I haven&#x27;t really seen it have an effect on the versicolor as well.&lt;br /&gt;But it doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin anymore, after a while it seems to help decrease the itchiness and it feels like a high quality diaper rash cream. It just isn&#x27;t the best skin feel product for a use that it hasn&#x27;t been designed for.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and could not find it locally.  It is very good for dealing with yeast rashes.</li>
    <li> This cream works fine. Thanks for making a good product.</li>
    <li> I never tried this before, so I took the chance. This is great stuff!! My fungus cleared up, and is would purchase BAZA again!!! Hope I won&#x27;t have to tho!! It works.</li>
    <li> Nothing can compare to this.  My son was extremely ill and we were constantly fighting with some type of skin problems... This stuff was the solution to them all.</li>
    <li> perfect for the application it was purchased for.</li>
    <li> THis product is awesome...works great and I would recommend this to anyone with under the breast sweat issues! Give this one an A+</li>
    <li> I was glad to buy this product as it was difficult to locate locally. The price was reasonable also.</li>
    <li> My son had a g-tube for years, but a few years ago we were able to permanently remove it. However, since his site has still not completely closed up, he requires daily &amp;#34;wound&amp;#34; care of the site. Baza antifungal has been invaluable to us during this process, and has been the only thing that helps keep his site healthy looking. Works wonders!</li>
    <li> This product has been a lifesaver in our home. Use it for yeasty diaper rash. It has the general antifungal ingredient and zinc oxide which is exactly what desitin is.</li>
    <li> This cream is amazing.  I had a prescription from the Doctor, not only was it expensive , it didn&#x27;t do the job.  This cream got rid of my rash in one to two applications.&lt;br /&gt;I tell all my friends how marvelous this cream is and inexpensive too !</li>
    <li> This really is good. My husband is who it was ordered for. Orders come quickly.</li>
    <li> DOES NOT WORK ON TINEA VERSICOLOR AND THE SMELL IS NASEUATING SAVE YOUR $$$</li>
    <li> I guess it does what it is supposed to do...it is a bit thicker than I expected, so it does not spread like a lotion.</li>
    <li> Loved this product , I am allergic to the formaldehyde that toilet paper contains as well as the bleach in sanitary pads. I used to be in immense pain until I found this product. At this , the irritation was so bad that I could barely walk. This stuff works !  I love it and will be a lifelong customer. No more irritation ! Yay</li>
    <li> I like this product.  Be sure that you need the Antifungal cream as they also make a barrier cream only.  My husband is almost bed ridden and it helps prevent bed sores.</li>
    <li> If you have been battling jock itch like I have, you must get this cream.  My jock itch comes and goes, but I feel is made worse from sweat.  This cream really helps to keep your areas dry and fungal free.  This actually works than any prescription medicine I have received from my doctor.</li>
    <li> It was a answer to my.prayers.  works miricals!!!</li>
    <li> IT IS A GREAT WOUND HEALER THIS  IS MY SEVENTH BUY I RECOMEND IT</li>
    <li> Great results after only two weeks. Better than prescription creams and more gentle on th skin. Im still using it.</li>
    <li> works great for fungal infections, diaper rashes and even athlete&#x27;s foot...was recommended to me by an ostomy doctor and have used it ever since</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this procuct. I am a 65 year old over weight woman and I get cracks and serious stinging in the fold of my absdomen, what some people refer to as the apron of fat. This cream was recommended by a nurse for my elderly mother and I tried it and bought it for myself. I also bought it for my daughter. It works and keeps me comfortable especially in the summer months!</li>
    <li> Does its job.  Has been very good for skin care.  I will be ordering more in the future.  So glad I found this product.</li>
    <li> Worked when Lotrimin failed. Worked when Lamasil failed. Large bottle and great price. Can not understand why I ever bothered with the others.</li>
    <li> finally I found something that works to keep the skin dry.  I lost over 100 pounds and have to keep my skin dry and I came across this product that works great.  I skin healed quickly and stayed dry.</li>
    <li> So I have these splotches all over my neck, arms and chest that were peeling and people thought it was dandruff that kept leaving skin all over my shirts.  A dermatologist told me it was a fungus and I can just ignore it, but it got itchy and kept spreading so screw that guy and his useless tip.  I got this because of it&#x27;s excellent reviews and I live in Florida so I assumed the anti-moisture would help with it.  Long story short, yeah for the most part the splotches went away, for some reason the ones on my arms ignored it altogether, then again they are a different shade of splotch than the other ones.  The marks have faded a lot but are still slightly visible after 2 weeks of application.  I&#x27;ll say it&#x27;s definitely making an improvement, but I don&#x27;t know if it can eradicate it altogether.  I recommend buying it, from the reviews it&#x27;ll probably cure any number of illnesses it&#x27;s not labeled for.</li>
    <li> Did not work for my particular fungus</li>
    <li> No more red, itchy, sore and embarrassing fungal areas that I have been dealing with for far too long.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The caregivers for mother in law have used this for a couple years to control fungus for her.  Personally&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t use it, but buy it for them to use on her at their request.</li>
    <li> This stuff works wonders. Great for athletes foot, rash under the breasts of my Grandmother. It does what it says and is very fairly priced.</li>
    <li> Better than the RX product per doctor.</li>
    <li> My Mother had yeast on her skin from taking too many infections after a staph infection. We tried other creams, but the skin was still red and not healing. One of our caregivers brought in a partial tube of this. In one treatment we saw a difference. Her skin is clear of any fungus or yeast. No more redness!!! Since, I am an RN I am thrilled to recommend this product.</li>
    <li> If you have been looking for something to stop the feminine itching or fungal rash, buy this.....it is the ONLY thing that works !!!!</li>
    <li> Works great and arrived quickly</li>
    <li> Consistency is very thick providing ample coverage and protection.  Wish the AF component was more potent for quicker healing but still worth purchasing.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live with out it! I am a big germ freak so I rub this on me so I wont catch nasty jock itch from a guy. Really keep the germs n cooties away! Lol</li>
    <li> Excellent cream for any fungal pr0oblem---especially feet care--using it whenever feet get problems--am glad this is on market and can be reordered .</li>
    <li> Whenever you are taking care of a person who is bedridden pressure sores are a constant concern. This does exactly as it states and puts a layer over the skin that acts as a shield blocking wetness and other offenders from causing tissue deterioration. This also works for people who have irritated skin folds and/or saggy skin (elderly). It has a pleasing scent but does not stain clothing and it works better than others advertised for the same thing. I will definitely purchase this product again! Just wish that it was in local stores.</li>
    <li> My mom liked it &amp; has made me bought it a couple of times.</li>
    <li> this product is EXCELLENT for protecting skin and healing a fungal rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;with a lowered immune system and bad lungs that require clearing, urinary stress incontinence is an occasional occurence. the regular anti-fungal creams never worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;apart from the prescribed tablets (fluconazole), this has been the only thing that&#x27;s worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;d recommend it to anyone looking. since it&#x27;s a barrier cream as well as an anti-fungal, it makes perfect sense!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve recommended it at my cystic fibrosis clinic to other patients with stress incontinence.</li>
    <li> This cream is not available in my area so I checked Amazon and this was recommended.  I am very happy with the results; my order was filled promptly and I an extremely satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product for personal hygiene issues. It works.</li>
    <li> made my rash 4x worse after one day, and it stinks.</li>
    <li> Would absolutely purchase again! Highly recommended. We are very happy with our purchase. The product is high quality and the customer service was as well. AAA+++ Thank you... We will be back for more!</li>
    <li> I had skin fungus between my breasts due to excessive moisture...this stuff cleared it away in about 3 weeks and has kept it off since. I would use some powder after it to also help prevent moisture. LOVE IT</li>
    <li> Because of an experience with a bad antibiotic, I ended up with a HORRID systemic candida problem. It lasted for months no matter what I did. This cream was a godsend. It didn&#x27;t make the problem (which was coming form the inside) go away, but it make the burning, cracked skin, and itching much more tolerable. I hope I never have to deal with something so awful again, but if I do, this is the stuff that soothed me.</li>
    <li> My little daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin is prone to bad diaper rashes, and I find that an anti-fungal cream is necessary sometimes to get rid of the rash.  I tried this cream as a substitute for the product Triple Paste AF, which also has 2% miconazole nitrate and works very well.  I was trying to save money because Baza is about one third the price of Triple Paste AF.  However, I do not recommend this Baza product for baby diaper rash.  The Baza cream has alcohol in it.  It also has fragrance added.  The alcohol content of this Baza product made my daughter scream in pain when I used it on her red, irritated skin.  This product exacerbated the pain, instead of relieving it.  Also, this Baza cream does not have the same blend of zinc oxide and petroleum jelly that works so well for ordinary diaper rash.  If you&#x27;re looking for a cheaper alternative to Triple Paste AF for diaper rash, just spend the money for Triple Paste AF and spare your child the pain of using this product.</li>
    <li> This cream is very mild and gentle on the skin and promotes healing really quickly. I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Perfect cream, I tried a lot of things in the market, a lot!! But this was the only good product I found, I bought it &#x27;cause of the reviews, and it was cheap... I had my skin all red, and nothing worked and with this cream was about 3 or 4 days and boom, gone!&lt;br /&gt;and please, never share bathroom with people you don&#x27;t know!!!</li>
    <li> I am a woman with Multiple Sclerosis who has to catheterize herself and deals with bits of urinary incontinence despite treatments with Botox to treat it.  It seems that I am always dealing with a moist environment on my bottom and I have tried lots of different creams and ointments such as [[ASIN:B004NYMQ88 A&amp;D Ointment, 4-Ounce (Pack of 2)]] and [[ASIN:B001VG1WOA Neosporin + Plus Pain Relief, Cream, 1.0-Ounce Tube]] ... I&#x27;ve also tried [[ASIN:B002CVV1HQ Cortizone-10 Max Strength Cortizone-10 Crme, 2oz Boxes (Pack of 2)]] for itching and pain.  I&#x27;ve dealt with sores for the past 18 months or so and it seems that after just a few days using this barrier cream with an antifungal component that I am beginning to get things under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells good (like a handcream) and less like medicine or cod liver oil like so many of the other diaper rash creams smell like and it is thick enough to provide a good barrier between my skin and irritants.  It&#x27;s a fact of life that I have had to deal with and at times it is extremely uncomfortable.  I think that I have begun to see a difference (although I have only used the Baza MB for about 4 days so far).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, so good.  Maintenance will have to be the solution.  I was happy to find this cream after seeing something similar used on my friend who was in a Rehabilitation facility with Stage 2 bedsores.  I am hoping this continues to work.</li>
    <li> stuff works awesome and smells really good. i used it with the tinea versicolor natural ointment and it wprked like a charm and a little bit goes a long way so it is deffinately worth the money</li>
    <li> Works great! Very fast delivery.</li>
    <li> After reading other reviews last year for this product used in conjunction with the Pedifixx tea tree oil soap, I bought both for my mother.  The improvement was immediate!  She had tried a prescription medicine, gold bond powder, and another cream with no results..  This product combination cleared up her skin problem completely within two weeks and continues to keep her skin smooth and free of the fungus/rash.  It also smells wonderful.  She doesn&#x27;t miss a day using these.  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Purchased this cream for my 90 year old mother who had developed a bad rash under the elastic of her bra.  She used this cream  before she was able to see a dermatologist who said to continue using it as it had the same ingredients as the medicine she would prescribe by prescription.  The rash has cleared up beautifully.  Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this cream! It is being used in place of a prescription I once had for desonide cream. I have a lot of sweating in the usual spots and this cream cuts down on the itchy rash that it quite often turns into. I was at first use concerned because it has a scent, but it works very well, I have no complaints. This is my second tube, it lasts really long, the tube is very big!</li>
    <li> Much like Desitin...alittle thinner. But it does help in those private creases that get hot at times. I didn&#x27;t know they made an adult version of Desitin...this would be it.</li>
    <li> Finally able to get relief and healing from heat rash under bra after starting to use this product.  Read other lengthy reviews when deciding to make this purchase.</li>
    <li> This very thick cream is very helpful in avoiding fungal infections in immobile or bed-bound individuals. It is kind of difficult to remove -- definitely use a wet washcloth with very warm water placed over the area to soften residual before attempting to remove excess or it can be a little hurtful... it stays where you put it and doesn&#x27;t rub in or rub off, for sure. We&#x27;ve used in connection with a perineal care program to avoid having to use meds to control fungal outbreaks. Our pharmacist says that many women with heavy or large breasts will use this in the crease underneath, particular when the weather is warm and sweating is more likely, and it can be a big help with fungal infection for women who could develop irritations in that area as well.</li>
    <li> Seems to be keeping the problems at bay- not necessarily improving the redness, but not getting any worse.</li>
    <li> Purchased this as a last ditch effort to treat my 7 month olds&#x27; diaper rash. She had been experiencing a mild blistering rash for a couple of weeks that was not helped by Desitin, Triple paste, Dr Smiths or Burts Bees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rash didn&#x27;t seem to bother her, so I kept looking for ways to treat at home without calling the ped. After doing some reading I thought it could be fungal or yeast (because of the blistering) so I thought I&#x27;d try this. Sure enough, after 2 days it&#x27;s just about clear.</li>
    <li> Nice cream and helpful with skin fungal rashes.  Would prefer clear cream to white, but still a good and useful product.</li>
    <li> This is very light and basically very little smelling.</li>
    <li> Good but have used better products like Calmoseptine.  I like this provides a anti-fungal but wish it offered a mentha ingredient to offer a cooling effect to the affected areas for my mom who is aging.  Tried this but will alternate with calmoseptine which is just to darned expensive.  Actually they both are...also wish they both came in a 4 to 6 oz jar size as the tube is great but when you get down to the last little bit you lose a great deal of the topical which is a waste.</li>
    <li> Baza Antifungal Cream cleared my wife&#x27;s persistent dermatological yeast infection when other over the counter and prescription remedies failed.  Worth twice the price.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a few years and I swear by it. It&#x27;s Great, effective and get&#x27;s the job done.</li>
    <li> This cream does work, you need to give it some time. It&#x27;s great for rash and other little private areas and such. I would recommend this cream.</li>
    <li> Came highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This cream (yes, you will still have to be clean and washed off) does the trick in a couple of applications.  Don&#x27;t take my word for it, give it a try and see if it works as well for you.  The trick is getting it off of your hands when done.  Warm water and soap and a little patience works best.</li>
    <li> This is a product I used years ago and could not find it locally. Then came Amazon.  I respond well to the active ingredient without an allergic reaction. The moisture barrier aspect of Baza is just a plus.</li>
    <li> Came earlier than promised. Easy to apply.</li>
    <li> I was trying to find anything that would help my co-worker.  She has a miserable rash after her cancer treatments.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for treatment of Jock Itch. My thoughts was If it could reduce the moisture, this would help reduce the fungal growth.  I am not sure exactly what the &amp;#34;Moisture Barrier&amp;#34; is supposed to do; but it doesn&#x27;t reduce the moisture, it actually seamed to be more moist with the product.  It didn&#x27;t seem to be as effective as just Miconazole, which is a component of this product.  It may be possible that with the combination of Miconazole, and the Moisture Barrier it actually dilutes the amount of Miconazole you are applying, this is only my thinking; in any case it didn&#x27;t do as well as the just Miconazole for me.</li>
    <li> My daughter had a diaper rash that prescription nystatin would not take away.  The doctor recommended &amp;#34;triple paste&amp;#34; which I couldn&#x27;t find anywhere.  I purchased this product because of the same active ingredients and it cleared up her diaper rash in a couple days.  Now I use this product the first time I see a rash starting to form and we have no problems.</li>
    <li> Got a question: how it looked like when you got yours? I open the lid and saw the cream directly without any cover.</li>
    <li> great stuff. Odorless</li>
    <li> this creme is a miracle.  I have had an itchy red bumpy rash under my breasts, after 1 application it started to feel better, after 2 days it is practically gone.</li>
    <li> Did not work as expected, however may not have been applicable to my condition, so may work well for others.</li>
    <li> This works very well only need a dab and problem solve . I use it right after shaving to prevent issues like razor burn/rash. did not sting .Come out of the tube a little thick but rubs in fair enough to and not greasy so easy to wash residue off your hands . We use it on toes or anywhere a rash is likely to pop up due to soaps,  hot weather or other causes so we  have not had any problems since using the product.  I did not purchase for all the above but we were out of our other first aid supply&#x27;s and discovered it works well for us for other things too .</li>
    <li> great product! recommended. good quality and design.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay for what I use it for.  I think it will last a long, long time.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised with how well this cream works.  I haven&#x27;t found anything at any other price that is comparable.</li>
    <li> I am glad we ordered this product for a family member, this cured the itching he had for a long time in about 4 weeks.</li>
    <li> I found it wasn&#x27;t any better then other products out there! Will use it until its gone, will not reorder.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised! Comforting</li>
