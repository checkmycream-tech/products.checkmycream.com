### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>you feeling great</li>
      <li>Great body wash leaves</li>
      <li>Great.  </li>
      <li>I used to get this from Target/Walmart but the 6 pack from amazon is comparable in price and keeps me smelling good.</li>
      <li>Works a good lather too.</li>
      <li>Price is good on line and in bulk.</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t think that it smells that good</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know about you, but I&#x27;d rather smell good all day</li>
      <li>so I was delighted to be able to find it for my son in law!</li>
      <li>I love a good man smell (coming from the wife of the man using it) and this is a nice and refreshing smell - not too musky, but definitely a good man smell to it!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s nice and everything</li>
      <li>This is by far the best scent of all the brands we have sampled.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ll probably order more soon.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this body wash.</li>
      <li>Not sure why they stopped selling this in stores; the best scent and a good value</li>
      <li>then be gauranteed 3 times clean!</li>
      <li>My favorite body wash since it has the right smell!  </li>
      <li>I like the scent on this because it gives you that nice clean straight out of the shower smell.</li>
      <li>This has quickly become my body wash of choice.</li>
      <li>Amazingly, we can no longer find it in our local stores.</li>
      <li>It leaves a light, fresh scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering like many similar products.</li>
      <li>Not to strong but not subtle either.  </li>
      <li>The others smell cheap, but this one is high quality.  </li>
      <li>I was leary at first, but just went with it -</li>
      <li>Personally, I&#x27;ve always liked Old Spice products.  </li>
      <li>Anyways, I have used all sort of body washes from various manufacturers and I always come back to the great scents of Old Spice.</li>
      <li>Got it really fast.</li>
      <li>My wife, who has a very keen sense of smell, compliments me on my aroma after using this product.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend Old Spice Body Wash!!!</li>
      <li>Even though the price of this item is great and it arrived on time, the seal on one of the bottles was broken, so the whole box and other bottles were covered in the body wash.</li>
      <li>Its the first time I could do that as I am an ex-smoker and cannot smell any of the other bar soaps after the shower.</li>
      <li>The only Old Spice scent that doesn&#x27;t stink.</li>

<li> I like the other old spice products though.</li>
<li> I discovered that walmart sells their old spice body wash for almost a dollar cheaper per bottle, i could have saved around 6 dollars by just buying in the store :/</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m used to buying this product at Target 2 for $8.88 after comparing prices I found not only this to be cheaper in price, but I wouldn&#x27;t have to pay for shipping. I highly recommend Old Spice Body Wash!!!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best scent of all the brands we have sampled.  The others smell cheap, but this one is high quality.  Amazingly, we can no longer find it in our local stores.</li>
    <li> I could actually smell it on me after the shower. Its the first time I could do that as I am an ex-smoker and cannot smell any of the other bar soaps after the shower. A++++</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this body wash. Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t last more than a few hours, very dissapointed. What ever happened to their \\&quot;8 hour scent technology\\&quot;. I don&#x27;t know about you, but I&#x27;d rather smell good all day then be gauranteed 3 times clean! Anyways, I have used all sort of body washes from various manufacturers and I always come back to the great scents of Old Spice.</li>

    <li> Personally, I&#x27;ve always liked Old Spice products.  This works well as a body wash.  My wife, who has a very keen sense of smell, compliments me on my aroma after using this product.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s nice and everything but I don&#x27;t think that it smells that good, I think it smells like laundry detergent... I like the other old spice products though.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find these in stores anymore.</li>
    <li> Been using it for years, guy I know let me use his and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since.  Price is good on line and in bulk.</li>
    <li> Great.  Got it really fast.</li>

    <li> My favorite body wash since it has the right smell!  Not to strong but not subtle either.  Works a good lather too.</li>
    <li> THis product isn&#x27;t carried in stores anymore so I was delighted to be able to find it for my son in law!</li>

    <li> Even though the price of this item is great and it arrived on time, the seal on one of the bottles was broken, so the whole box and other bottles were covered in the body wash. My complain is only about that part of the purchase.</li>

    <li> Great body wash leaves you feeling great</li>
