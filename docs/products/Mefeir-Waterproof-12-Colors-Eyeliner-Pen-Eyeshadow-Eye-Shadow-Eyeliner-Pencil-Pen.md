    <li> Great value for these eyeliner pencisl</li>
    <li> Colors are cute and go on smoothly. I would recommend primer though.</li>

    <li> Very mushy and it smears all over. Good variety of colors, but it just doesn&#x27;t stay put.</li>
    <li> So Awesome! Arrived earlier than said and go on really easy</li>
    <li> Good product and coming earlier</li>
    <li> very dry when putting on, I had to press down on the sensitive eyelid area and the color only lasted about 3 hours then smudged</li>
    <li> I have been using these off and on. They aren&#x27;t the best eyeliners but they do their job. I expected the colors to be more pigmented. I don&#x27;t really like how they aren&#x27;t very creamy. Although, my favorite quality about them is the variety of colors.</li>
    <li> Very good eyeliner pencils especially for the price. The only thing is that with my eyes, I have a very deep crease were my eyelid and the skin below my eyebrow touch so it smudges a lot with it. Either ways very good colors especially the blue, red, gold, and black.</li>
    <li> I like that I only have to apply these once. I just need a bigger variety of colors.</li>
    <li> Sorry, these are not waterproof. Nice colors but they spread around even if you sweat. But the colors are pretty.</li>
    <li> These eyeliners are waterproof but not smudge proof. I cupped water in my hand and tossed it on my face and nothing happened to the liner, it stayed the same! However if you rub it with a wet finger it will smudge. I was very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> colors are not as vibrant and they do not slide onto skin.</li>

    <li> this really feels good as an eyelinber. the color is just too good!</li>
    <li> This is for Juanita Alfaro. Mame. You said you have a deep crease in you eye socket. Be sure to prime the lip and use a show base to make color  vivid.  After you use the pen in your crease blend it up and out reapply till  the colored desired then set it with powder</li>
    <li> I was so surprised that the quality is so good for such a cheap price. The colors are really bold and bright and pretty. Obviously it&#x27;s best to use a primer before applying any eye makeup or it&#x27;ll probably smudge. Would buy these again and recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great Eyeliners! love the colors and stayed on all day. Great for the price.</li>
