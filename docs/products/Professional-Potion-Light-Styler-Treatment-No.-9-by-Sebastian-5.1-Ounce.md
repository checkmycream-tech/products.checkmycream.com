      <li>I have baby fine hair and this product makes the curling iron work magic.</li>
      <li>this might be fine for you.</li>
      <li>This is a good treatment to leave in, my hair shines o lot when I use this product and it is very soft.</li>
      <li>These fit the bill for what I needed.  </li>
      <li>Fantastic.</li>
      <li>yet full.  </li>
      <li>Makes hair shiney and make sure to stray all over, even ur ends, but not to much.</li>
      <li>The spray isn&#x27;t as good as the regular No. 9 product, but it still works for me.  </li>
      <li>Gave it beautiful shine down to the ends.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair feel soft and it complements the shampoo and conditioner very well and smells good too.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not enough on my damp hair to keep it from getting frizzy and it makes dry hair sticky, so I haven&#x27;t figured out how best to use it up.</li>
      <li>I have not been able to use because I don&#x60;t read Spanish</li>
      <li>I love Potion 9 and actually bought this by mistake, not realizing it&#x27;s a spray.</li>
      <li>While my hair is still damp, I lightly spritz on the Light Styler Treatment and blow dry with my round brush for a wonderful style that is soft to the touch and can be curled, straight, or styled in a bit of an unkept look which works well for weekend down time.  </li>
      <li>It is great on wet hair or dry hair!</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t use too much or you will look &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I really like this product.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping by Amazon.</li>
      <li>If you have straight hair or non-frizzy curls</li>
      <li>If  I spray on too much product though, it tends to make my hair feel almost sticky.</li>
      <li>Will absolutely order again.</li>
      <li>This product offers me just the right amount of frizz control as my colored hair is unruly.  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really love this, made my hair a bit greasy and really weighted it down.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not bad but it is not as moisturizing as the regular thicker version.</li>
      <li>Most hair conditioners weight it down and make it even straighter.</li>
      <li>I stumbled upon the Professional Potion Light Styler Treatment by accident when I thought I was purchasing the regular formula of Sebastian Potion.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Would highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>This leave on product can be used on wet or dry hair and provides excellent results without making my hair look limp.</li>
      <li>I should have researced this product a little bit better.</li>
      <li>Wow!!</li>
      <li>This product works really well and not heavy at all.</li>
      <li>I may spray this on first and then scrunch regular Potion 9 or another leave-in into my hair as well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.</li>
      <li>This is the only leave-in conditioner that I have found that really makes my hair soft.  </li>
      <li>tossel my son&#x27;s hair with my finger&#x27;s once his hair dries naturally.</li>
      <li>This product makes my hair soft and takes away my frizzies</li>
      <li>Never heavy in my hair and adds shine, resiliency, and protection.  </li>
      <li>This product helps with that along with making my hair feel soft.</li>
      <li>I bought this thinking that it would be like the regular No. 9 treatment that I really like.  </li>
      <li>No heavy coating or greasy feel and gives my hair</li>
      <li>I spray in my hair wet &amp; let it air dry - leaves my hair super curly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d prefer the other product for quality, but the spray is really convenient in the mornings when I&#x27;m pressed for time.</li>
