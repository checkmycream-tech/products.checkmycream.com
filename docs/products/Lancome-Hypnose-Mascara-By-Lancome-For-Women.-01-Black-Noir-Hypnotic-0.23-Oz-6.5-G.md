      <li>Although i saved money the actual mascara wasnt the best.</li>
      <li>The brush is nice, separates lashes for a clean look but you just can&#x27;t see the difference.  </li>
      <li>It is a great deal as far as price</li>
      <li>I should have kept buying Extreme one which was the best one I ever used.</li>
      <li>While the price is more costly than the ones in the make-up isle, personally it is worth it because it leaves my lashes looking longer than ever.</li>

      <li>I get free two day</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for several years and super happy with the product.</li>
      <li>Buy fresh!</li>
      <li>mascara is a nice thickening mascara with a soft brush.  </li>
      <li>Honestly, it looks like it was an old makeup counter&#x27;s demo mascara...</li>
      <li>It did lengthen and separate my lashes in a very nice black color it didnt thicken or curl them at all.</li>
      <li>Really puts in on smooth and stays that way.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
      <li>I like my lashes a lot more since I started using it and find it is well worth the difference in price between it and Maybelline, my old standby.  </li>
      <li>And not like when he leaves an excess in cilia, but not always.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to people who want to have powerful eyes.</li>
      <li>Amazing how much cheaper it was only because of a package defect.</li>
      <li>The brush is very gentle on the eyelashes.  </li>
      <li>Initially, it went on very smoothly, but after about a week, it began to clump like you wouldn&#x27;t believe.</li>
      <li>I used this one for years, though I have since switched to Lancome Hypnose Drama because it has a higher impact look.</li>
      <li>First, Lancome Hypnose Mascara covers my lashes well.  </li>
      <li>For years, I wished I could afford higher quality make-up.</li>
      <li>I do not recommend it..is better to buy them from the actual Lancôme counter at the Mall.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t last as long as Maybelline Great Lash, however.</li>
      <li>I have never bought a mascara that adds more volume or makes my lashes look so long, than this mascara.</li>
      <li>This mascara is the real deal and it really is a Lancôme product!</li>
      <li>But, the formula is even smoother, the wand is really nice (a little smaller) and the waterproof formula just feels more gentle.</li>
      <li>smart, and have been finding things like this mascara in Amazon, with Prime</li>
      <li>I like this product because it leaves lashes lengthened with a certain volume.</li>
      <li>Now the sample stuff really worked</li>
      <li>I really like this mascara.</li>
      <li>/&gt;BG-Great, but almost identical to Voluminous, which is much cheaper</li>
      <li>Dries so fast that by the time you grab your lash comb, you can&#x27;t run it through any lashes stuck together.</li>
      <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;pros-Black was rich, dried super fast (good if you curl), washed off easily (not waterproof),</li>
      <li>I have tried maybelline, covergirl, neutrogena, loreal, revlon, dior, clinique, YSL, benefit, estee lauder and many other brands.</li>
      <li>sure after I read some of the other reviews,</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m not so sure what the difference is other than the applicator.</li>
      <li>I have short, straight, fine eyelashes naturally.</li>
      <li>I love this mascara - but will not buy online again as it was old and somewhat dry.</li>
      <li>My lashes are extremely long and it doesnt leave the smudge mark near my brow and its so easy to get off.</li>
      <li>-Goes on smooth and clump free, Separates and lengthens, you can build thicker lashes with minimal clumping if you let dry between applications.</li>
      <li>It makes your eyelashes seem as though they are naturally so full of volume and long.</li>
      <li>But no one beats the Hypnose Black! :)</li>
      <li>In my life I used tons of mascaras from all the models and competitors, I&#x27;m always trying new ones.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s thick and black, goes on smoothly, and the brush separates lashes nicely.</li>
      <li>I have tried numerous mascaras, many of which more expensive than Lancome hypnose.</li>
      <li>Less flaking than TR, but still a tiny bit.&lt;br /&gt;Cons- Wand is huge!</li>
      <li>I would scrape as much as I could back into the bottle, but even then, I needed a tissue to wipe off the excess mascara.</li>
      <li>This product is not the same as teh real Lancome Hypnose.  </li>
      <li>It takes several coats to show and who wants to layer on mascara (?).  </li>
      <li>do yourself a favor and order directly from Lancome or a trusted retailer.</li>
      <li>After 5 mins I did a gentle eye rub test, and all those tiny clumps fell off onto my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>gives a fake lash look in a good way</li>
      <li>Dries less quickly</li>
      <li>The mascara goes on smoothly with very little clumping.  </li>

<li> The box had fallen apart due to old age.</li>
<li> which true Lancome, the brush is thin.  </li>
<li> I had high hopes for this mascara, but its clumps after 2 coats and it takes forever to dry, so I wasted my money.</li>
<li> It isnt clumpy and it doesn&#x27;t dry out, but it wish it made them look a little more dramatic.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t make your eye lashes 100% longer, but mascara stays in place all day long.</li>
<li> I feel like using this stuff will be gentler on my lashes in the long run.</li>
<li> This mascara was old and all dried out.</li>
<li> The only thing I can complain is that Its somewhat hard to apply as far as it grabbing each lash.</li>
<li> I finally broke down and purchased this mascara.</li>
<li> Received this product very dry, will never buy stuff like this..</li>
<li> I&#x27;d love to review the product itself, but sadly, I received a tube of mascara that had been HEAVILY used (dried mascara all over the rim and wand).</li>
<li> I received completele different maskara (it wasn&#x27;t hypnose, that I ordered), and it was dry, so I hardly could use it.</li>
<li> It is a little expensive but it is worth every penny.</li>
<li> /&gt;Lancôme-I wanted to hate it, but I love it.</li>
<li> /&gt;TR-I didn&#x27;t hate it, but I didn&#x27;t love</li>
<li> But also one that does that without weighing the lashes down and preferably gives a curl.</li>
<li> $20+ down the drain.</li>
<li> like I just wiped black glue onto them.</li>
<li> It looked like glue coming out of the bottle, made my lashes stick together, and just turned into a mess.</li>
<li> It gives me long, thick, separated, flirty eyelashes.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t like the spidery look of the lengthening mascaras, nor the little flakes that fall into my cheeks.  </li>
<li> I bought at Ulta, and I noticed a few reviews that bought from Amazon may have ended up with old or fake tubes.</li>
<li> I might use this alongside another mascara just so i dont waste it by throwing it out.</li>
<li> Please, don&#x27;t waste your time or money...</li>
<li> Not sure, but mine was great.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> This is no better than the stuff you get at the store.</li>
<li> The brush to apply was very thick...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> In my life I used tons of mascaras from all the models and competitors, I&#x27;m always trying new ones. But no one beats the Hypnose Black! :)</li>
    <li> Best mascara I have worn! My sister recommended it and now I see why!  Really puts in on smooth and stays that way.</li>
    <li> I have used Lancome mascara about more than 10 years. This one is the worst. It&#x27;s just basic mascara. I should have kept buying Extreme one which was the best one I ever used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d love to review the product itself, but sadly, I received a tube of mascara that had been HEAVILY used (dried mascara all over the rim and wand). Honestly, it looks like it was an old makeup counter&#x27;s demo mascara... and I don&#x27;t know where that thing has been! I immediately threw it away after seeing the seller&#x27;s return policy. $20+ down the drain. Please, don&#x27;t waste your time or money... do yourself a favor and order directly from Lancome or a trusted retailer.</li>
    <li> I really like this mascara. I wsn&#x27;t sure after I read some of the other reviews, but I found it to be what I was looking for. My order came the next day, too!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for several years and super happy with the product. It doesn&#x27;t make your eye lashes 100% longer, but mascara stays in place all day long.</li>
    <li> The mascara goes on smoothly with very little clumping.  It does a good job separating my lashes and comes off easily with a good eye make up remover.  I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> This mascara was old and all dried out. The box had fallen apart due to old age. It was to be a gift.</li>
    <li> For years, I wished I could afford higher quality make-up. I finally broke down and purchased this mascara. Initially, it went on very smoothly, but after about a week, it began to clump like you wouldn&#x27;t believe. It looked like glue coming out of the bottle, made my lashes stick together, and just turned into a mess. I would scrape as much as I could back into the bottle, but even then, I needed a tissue to wipe off the excess mascara. Even then, it clumped and made my lashes stick together like I just wiped black glue onto them. I am very disappointed. Thankfully, it cured my desire for overpriced make-up. I would pay more for a bottle of Maybelline than this garbage.</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara I have ever used!!!! I have tried maybelline, covergirl, neutrogena, loreal, revlon, dior, clinique, YSL, benefit, estee lauder and many other brands. However, lancome hypnose tops them all for me. It opens your eyes up and doesn&#x27;t clump. The brush is very gentle on the eyelashes.  I have gotten so many compliments about my eyelashes while wearing this mascara. Just one stroke is enough to work wonders on your eyelashes. It makes your eyelashes seem as though they are naturally so full of volume and long. It is a little expensive but it is worth every penny. A must buy!</li>
    <li> All of Lancome&#x27;s mascaras are wonderful! I used this one for years, though I have since switched to Lancome Hypnose Drama because it has a higher impact look. Still, all Lancome mascaras are good stuff. Lancome makes some of the best mascara in the industry.  [...] Another review can be found here. All in all, you can&#x27;t go wrong with Lancome - for mascara anyways.</li>
    <li> I received completele different maskara (it wasn&#x27;t hypnose, that I ordered), and it was dry, so I hardly could use it. I would not recommend this seller at all.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it leaves lashes lengthened with a certain volume. And not like when he leaves an excess in cilia, but not always.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to people who want to have powerful eyes.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s thick and black, goes on smoothly, and the brush separates lashes nicely. It doesn&#x27;t last as long as Maybelline Great Lash, however.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very particular about my mascara and this is the best!  I&#x27;ve tried others but keep going back to the Hypnose.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara! My lashes are extremely long and it doesnt leave the smudge mark near my brow and its so easy to get off. The only thing I can complain is that Its somewhat hard to apply as far as it grabbing each lash. It isnt clumpy and it doesn&#x27;t dry out, but it wish it made them look a little more dramatic. Works way better than any dior mascara!</li>
    <li> Although i saved money the actual mascara wasnt the best. It did lengthen and separate my lashes in a very nice black color it didnt thicken or curl them at all. It also flaked with a light rubbing of the eye during the day and smudged. I might use this alongside another mascara just so i dont waste it by throwing it out.</li>
    <li> I chose it because it&#x27;s always worked for me, and doesn&#x27;t damage my eye lashes. I totally rely in it.</li>
    <li> This mascara is the real deal and it really is a Lancôme product! Amazing how much cheaper it was only because of a package defect. It lasts a lot longer than the drug store mascaras and if you like Kim Kardashian&#x27;s eyelashes then you will definitely love this mascara. I have never bought a mascara that adds more volume or makes my lashes look so long, than this mascara.</li>
    <li> I have short, straight, fine eyelashes naturally.I therefore need a mascara that not only gives plenty of volume and thickness. But also one that does that without weighing the lashes down and preferably gives a curl. The Lancome hypnose mascara does all that! I have tried numerous mascaras, many of which more expensive than Lancome hypnose. However, this is the one for me. It gives me long, thick, separated, flirty eyelashes. For once a mascara that lives up to the expectations</li>
    <li> I bought at Ulta, and I noticed a few reviews that bought from Amazon may have ended up with old or fake tubes. Not sure, but mine was great.&lt;br /&gt;I have thin med-long brown lashes and was looking for something to bring out the length and separate for fullness. I tried They&#x27;re Real, BAD Gal (both Benefit), Loreal Voluminous Waterproof, and Lancôme Hypnose waterproof. Hopefully the range of products is helpful :)&lt;br /&gt;TR-I didn&#x27;t hate it, but I didn&#x27;t love it.&lt;br /&gt;pros-Black was rich, dried super fast (good if you curl), washed off easily (not waterproof), gives a fake lash look in a good way (thick)&lt;br /&gt;cons-Clumpy, but that&#x27;s what makes it thickening. These are tiny chunks left on the lashes that some chicks won&#x27;t mind, but I prefer totally smooth/separated. Dries so fast that by the time you grab your lash comb, you can&#x27;t run it through any lashes stuck together. After 5 mins I did a gentle eye rub test, and all those tiny clumps fell off onto my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BG-Great, but almost identical to Voluminous, which is much cheaper, so consider this a review for both.&lt;br /&gt;Pros-Goes on smooth and clump free, Separates and lengthens, you can build thicker lashes with minimal clumping if you let dry between applications. Less flaking than TR, but still a tiny bit.&lt;br /&gt;Cons- Wand is huge! I preferred Voluminous&#x27; wand. Dries less quickly (only con if you set curls). Save your money and get Voluminous, especially for a waterproof formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lancôme-I wanted to hate it, but I love it. It actually goes on and produces very similar results to the Voluminous, so if you are on a budget, stick with V and you&#x27;ll be happy. But, the formula is even smoother, the wand is really nice (a little smaller) and the waterproof formula just feels more gentle. I feel like using this stuff will be gentler on my lashes in the long run. No flaking!&lt;br /&gt;Cons-price. I never thought I&#x27;d spend over $20 on a mascara, but I&#x27;m having a midlife crisis and it&#x27;s cheaper than a corvette.</li>
    <li> While the price is more costly than the ones in the make-up isle, personally it is worth it because it leaves my lashes looking longer than ever. People comment that my lashes look fake. It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
    <li> Received this product very dry, will never buy stuff like this.. I do not recommend it..is better to buy them from the actual Lancôme counter at the Mall.</li>
    <li> Product horrible.  I have been using Lancome for over 30 years and the product I received was not the same.  The brush to apply was very thick...which true Lancome, the brush is thin.  By the end of the day, it looked at though I had no mascara on at all.  I would not buy from the seller again.</li>
    <li> This is the only mascara i use!  It does what it says it does.  I have used this since it came on the market.</li>
    <li> I had a Hypnose sample before I bought this mascara and it must be totally different. This is no better than the stuff you get at the store. Now the sample stuff really worked so I&#x27;m not so sure what the difference is other than the applicator.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara - but will not buy online again as it was old and somewhat dry. I considered returning - but had already opened and used. Buy fresh!</li>
    <li> This product is not the same as teh real Lancome Hypnose.  It is a great deal as far as price but you get what you pay for.  Clumps.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this mascara, but its clumps after 2 coats and it takes forever to dry, so I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> I am big fan of Lancome and did my research, looking for the perfect mascara.  I am disappointed in Hypnose.  It takes several coats to show and who wants to layer on mascara (?).  The brush is nice, separates lashes for a clean look but you just can&#x27;t see the difference.  Wanted a product to make the eyes &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; a bit, this is not the one.  Sorry Lancome, I still love you but this product is not one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shopping on Amazon a lot.  At over four dollars a gallon, I think twice about driving to the mall twenty minutes from home.  I never used to realize that it ads to the cost of the one product I was driving the to buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got smart, and have been finding things like this mascara in Amazon, with Prime I get free two day shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HYPNOSE mascara is a nice thickening mascara with a soft brush.  I don&#x27;t like the spidery look of the lengthening mascaras, nor the little flakes that fall into my cheeks.  There&#x27;s none of that with HYPNOSE from Lancôme.  I like my lashes a lot more since I started using it and find it is well worth the difference in price between it and Maybelline, my old standby.  A+ for color, quality, thickening, removability, and ease of use.</li>
    <li> First, Lancome Hypnose Mascara covers my lashes well.  I get longer, thicker looking lashes without clumping. It stays on all day and night.  I use a mascara remover to remove it at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I had tried several mascara brands and had allergic reactions.  Lancome mascara does not give me an allergic reaction.</li>
