<li> Long shipping time though.</li>
<li> These work just &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34; but I prefer the other toe separators.  </li>
<li> Due to rheumatoid Arto.</li>
<li> The strap on the big toe is hard to keep from twisting.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t use these to straighten my toes but rather to prevent blisters from forming between toes that press against each other too tightly.  </li>
<li> They were quite large, which wouldn&#x27;t have been that bad, but the quality was also terrible.</li>
<li> uncomfortable to wear all day inside a shoe.</li>
<li> too awkward</li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>
<li> This stuff has a nasty chemical smell, and gives me contact dermatitis if used.  </li>

    <li> Works perfectly, will reorder</li>
    <li> Too soft to keep a space between my toes. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> uncomfortable to wear all day inside a shoe. too awkward</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my feet a lot for my line of work. This has brought much comfort to my feet. I love how soft the gel is.</li>
    <li> These work just &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34; but I prefer the other toe separators.  Sometimes, these make my toes cramp because they&#x27;re connected.  Not bad but a little constraining,.</li>
    <li> I have a hammed toe and a bunion and i use these to wear at night in bed to keep my toes in line.</li>
    <li> These toe separators are very comfortable and help my feet a lot, now I can be 10 to 12 hours in my feet and my bunion doesn&#x27;t hurt anymore</li>
    <li> Outstanding. Have been looking at surgery for a long time because of my big toe joint where it meets the foot. Due to rheumatoid Arto. Could not have the down time for surgery so these little guys have been fantastic.</li>
    <li> All of us problem feet people want that one miracle item that will work.  These can help but they turn.  Everything is worth a try, you never know when you find that one thing that works for you.  As for me, they help but I will keep looking.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me--too flexible</li>
    <li> Helps and stays in place</li>
    <li> works fine - better than the other gel separators.</li>
    <li> Nice product works great! Thanks.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Long shipping time though.</li>
    <li> These work perfect for my tender little toes.  Very soft almost skin like.  Eliminates pain when walking. Great find.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable, I forget I have it on.  The strap on the big toe is hard to keep from twisting.  A sock does keep it in place.</li>
    <li> They were quite large, which wouldn&#x27;t have been that bad, but the quality was also terrible. They were so stretchy, I don&#x27;t know how they could work for anyone&#x27;s feet! You&#x27;re better off with a rubber band!</li>
    <li> Ok but a little hard to put shoes on overthis</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use these to straighten my toes but rather to prevent blisters from forming between toes that press against each other too tightly.  It works perfectly.</li>
    <li> NOT SILICONE.  There must be hundreds of sellers on Amazon now describing their products as &amp;#34;silicone&amp;#34; when they are NOT.  These are made of some smelly, flimsy material -- probably TPE or one of the newer synthetic formulas.  A lot of people seem to think that everything flexible that&#x27;s clear or white is silicone!  Silicone is very durable, odorless, usually transparent, and is inert so it can&#x27;t cause any skin allergies or other reactions from the human body.  This stuff has a nasty chemical smell, and gives me contact dermatitis if used.  It&#x27;s flimsy and tears easily.</li>
    <li> As described! It is easy to clean and use. I have been using it for couple of weeks and it&#x27;s helping me with my bunion problem. These Cerkos Gel Toe Separators are worth it!</li>
