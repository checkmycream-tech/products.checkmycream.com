<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s the  only threaded floss I use.</li>
    <li> Geat floss but on line price is no bargin.</li>
    <li> Literally does not fit between my teeth. I have used other floss of this style that fits bewteen my teeth, but this one when I try to put it in between my lower inciscors, the tip of the floss just bends/gets soft. I think the floss is too THICK. thickness does not equal rigidness. I bought a pack of 5 unfortunately so now I am stuck with a bunch of floss I can&#x27;t use.</li>
    <li> Much better than those dopey flossers that tend to be clumsy. I also think it&#x27;s &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34; this way. You use it and toss it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had trouble finding these in retail stores, so I was glad to be able to get a large supply on line.</li>
    <li> This floss frays too easily leaving little strands of itself between your teeth, which is more than a little annoying. I would just buy the threaders you can use with regular floss if you need to get between braces.</li>
    <li> If this is the super floss replacement, it is much much worst than the original. Super floss had a sponge on the thread that helps to remove the plaque, the glide threader dont. It is basically a common thread with a hard tip for braces.</li>
    <li> If you get the right type of dental picks--wide thread--they are far more useful than this lousy floss. Save your money.</li>
    <li> I have 2 dental bridges. I hate to even take the time to floss, much less load a threader and then try to feel around for the place between my teeth to insert it. I tried some other threading floss, but it was just as hard to use as the threader. This product, Crest Glide Threader Floss, works quickly, comfortably and easily! It almost finds the space and inserts itself! It&#x27;s one of those rare products that totally lives up to its claims. There&#x27;s only one negative: the price. But hey, sometimes you have to pay for quality (although I&#x27;m so cheap that I wash off a strand and reuse it 2 or 3 times).</li>
    <li> Great product.  I take these to work with me and when I travel.  Saves time and my teeth!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had braces for about 5 weeks now. These floss threaders work awesome. I have some very tight teeth, and have always appreciated the Glide products. These threaders are the best solution for those with braces. The stiff threader end is plenty long enough and I can easily get it under my braces wire. I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> My daughter used these while she had braces and now that she has permanent retainers.  She refuses to use any other type of floss product.  Only wish they were cheaper, but hey, she&#x27;s doing a great job flossing and has beautiful teeth!</li>
    <li> Been using these for at least 10 years. Love them!!!</li>
    <li> Good product. Always arrives in a timely fashion.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, and I&#x27;m happy with the product sent. However, it is not the same as the one found in stores. Individual threaders have flimsier packaging, and the floss itself is even thinner. For the price, I&#x27;d rather just purchase this at a local pharmacy.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, great product. Used for ppl with retainers or bridges that can&#x27;t accomodate regular style floss</li>
    <li> Recently, this product (dental floss with dental pic on one end) was used at my dentist&#x27;s office.  Whomever invented this neat product should be commended.  It is a time saver and does a great job of cleaning between one&#x27;s teeth as well as going under a bridge, etc.  So happy to have found on Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> Anyone who has a dental bridge needs these. The 4-pack here is a better buy than at the drug store.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Love the way it works under bridges.</li>
    <li> Each piece of this floss has one end that&#x27;s folded over and bonded to itelf to stiffen it enough to be threaded under bridges.  Each piece of floss is plenty long enough to not only clean under my bridge but to also clean between all of my other teeth.  As far as I can tell it&#x27;s non-shredding.  Other floss I&#x27;ve used shreds or gets caught between two particular teeth in my mouth, but not this floss.    I&#x27;m very pleased with this floss and I&#x27;ll order more when I run out.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve seen for easing the work of cleaning my extensive dental work (two bridges and two implants).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The threader portion makes it a breeze to get the floss under the bridge while the Glide floss is extremely strong and shred resistant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each piece has enough length to allow several wraps around your fingers to reach the back teeth and get between the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I subscribe to this product and receive an additional 10% discount.  Love that!</li>
    <li> Works well on teeth; Dentist recommended product.</li>
    <li> Not much to say other than it does what it is made to do.  Very easy to glide through my braces and floss!</li>
    <li> Excellent for flossing</li>
    <li> This item has made flossing under my connected-crown teeth almost effortless.  I noticed that when my dental hygienist flossed under my crowns, my gums would bleed a lot.  She recommended the Glide Threader Floss, and now I cannot imagine being without it.  My gums are no longer bleeding and my mouth feels really clean at last!</li>
    <li> Good to have supply on hand as they go quickly.</li>
    <li> I got these to use when I got my bridge.  The stiff end threads under the bridge with no problem and the floss is fairly sturdy.  They say no fray but I have some sharp edges so I have had some fraying, but it&#x27;s very minor.  The fact that these are individually wrapped was a plus for me, they are easy to toss into your travel kit when on the road or have a few in your desk at work.</li>
    <li> ... but makes it easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes the economical way makes things harder...in this case instead of a multi-step process of messing around with a bridge threader plus floss, there is a simple one step--tear open the package.  Ridiculous and a first world issue, finding that opening two containers and putting the floss and the threader together together was &#x27;difficult&#x27;, but the reality is that when fatigued before bed it was too easy to skip the flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have definitely improved my flossing habits by using these.  Pathetic on my part, but true nonetheless.  I just keep an eye out for sales and deals (and add-ons to other shipping) to make them slightly more economical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JTG</li>
    <li> If I hear one more comment from a dentist or dental hygenist that I need to clean better between my teeth where my permanent retainer sits, I am going to scream!  I have tried everything.  The little floss threaders.  Another kind like this but the floss was fuzzy (like a pipecleaner) and kept getting stuck on the metal.  These work so well!  I use this every single night, and it has yet to fail me.  Even though it seems to be stuck in the tiniest pile in the bottom of the package.  These are not cheap, but you get a better deal from Amazon than the local grocery/drugstore, and besides, these are not the easiest to find in my area.  Last cleaning, the hygenist did not yell at me.  That says a lot.</li>
    <li> I use these everyday with my front teeth that have individually glued permanent retainers. I just wish there were more in a box. :)</li>
    <li> Great for tight spaces and permanent retainers.</li>
    <li> Pro&#x27;s:  stiff end threads easily through bridgework; very fine floss fits easily between tight teeth; doesn&#x27;t shred from friction or snagging; hygenic single use packages&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s:  very fine floss digs into fingers during flossing</li>
    <li> Prefer the Oral B Product.  Thinner less waxy. However tip more positive.  Does the job. Thread seems to be stronger.</li>
    <li> Great product if you have dental work and you need a flosser.  Unfortunately, it&#x27;s a bit expensive (everywhere not just amazon); however, it is without a doubt the best product of it&#x27;s kind.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and less expensive.</li>
    <li> This a good item if you have some bridge or appareil on your mouth. It is soft and, because the tip, it is ease to pass through your teeth.</li>
    <li> My orthodontist gave me a little pack of Eez Thru threader things that I was supposed to use with regular dental floss--WORST EVER.  It was always coming unthreaded while I was flossing.  (What a pain!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I found these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE these!  It&#x27;s so nice that they&#x27;re individually wrapped, because that makes it really easy to keep a couple in my purse for times when I eat away from home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought maybe the threader end would get bent or not be reinforced enough to get the job done.  Nope, it&#x27;s just perfect.  The only thing I don&#x27;t love is that the dental floss piece seems kind of long, and it&#x27;s a lot of floss to have to pull through after I&#x27;ve flossed a particular spot.  But, that&#x27;s not really a big deal, and some people probably like it that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these for anyone with braces or a permanent retainer.</li>
    <li> This is the only product I have found that cleans under my bridge.  Unlike regular floss the ends are coated and stiff so they can easily slide under a bridge.  I prefer them individually wrapped so they don&#x27;t get all tangled.</li>
    <li> This is the only floss I really like because of the threader feature which makes the task easier.And since a family member has braces this is considerably easier for them to use also.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted. No longer can find n stores.</li>
    <li> These are long pieces of floss, each individually packaged.  The first few inches are a stiff plastic like portion, making it easy to thread between teeth.  The next section is like typical wide floss and the last section is a thicker spongy material. Does not shred.  These are indispensible  for those with braces or extensive dental work.  The fact that they individually packages means you can throw a few in your purse and they do not get disgusting.</li>
    <li> If you need to get between your teeth and hate the floss loops, these are the ticket. Works great for braces too.</li>
    <li> Both my kids tried different flosses while having their braces, and both thought this one is the best.&lt;br /&gt;I now use the amaon subscription feature to get regular shipments of this, and never have to go without it, as in the drug store they sometimes run out.</li>
    <li> Amazon is the best way to buy this increasingly expensive product.  It performs so much better than other brands for everyone in the family</li>
    <li> As the other reviewers have mentioned, these are great for any kind of dental or orthodontic appliance. They are particularly effective for permanent retainers! I always dreaded flossing, but these make it quick and easy. Definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> My orthodontist never mentioned this kind of floss. Instead she gave me a threader, which is just like a needle threader except it has a bigger hole. Total pain! It takes long enough to floss between each brace, much less flossing the string each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hygentist used this when I went in for a routine cleaning. Yes! It has a two inch stiff/hard section that is super easy to stick under the wire, but in between the brackets. Then you pull it through and floss as usual. The stiff section is long enough to reach my molars in the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being an adult with braces, due to TMJ rather than cosmetic reasons, I find it to be a pain (literally and figurativel) to care for the braces. I cannot imagine a kid honestly taking the time to floss. I dread it each night as it makes my nightly teeth cleaning take that much longer. Regardless, this stuff makes it SO much easier and makes me much less likely to skip a night of flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On another note, I also purchased a water pik. You still need to floss. The pick is great for around the brackets, but the floss is needed to scrape the sides of your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, one last thing, these are packaged in little individual envelopes so they are super easy to carry with you. That is a must with braces! They&#x27;ve actually come in handy with my family when we&#x27;ve been out and about and someone had something in their teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome product!</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed when I got braces (round 2, wear your retainers kids) was my usual ritual of hitting up the Glide Pro-Health floss was totally out. I think Glide makes the best floss, on the opposite end of the spectrum of that stuff you can buy at gas stations which is about as good as a thread from a dirty shirt. At first I tried what I was given, to loop or tie it on those fishing line threaders. That&#x27;s like running hard, pokey plastic through your teeth before each pull, and accidentally biting down is like getting a small piece of bone, almost enough to break a tooth I swear. You would be forgiven for thinking those were the only solution looking in stores or from what the orthodontist says, it&#x27;s only thanks to Amazon I ever heard of these. This integrates a bit of rigid line in the end of the floss, unimpeded by annoying bumps or knots (unless you make one, which will be as gentle as doing that with Glide normally). I did have to deduct a star because it is possible to pull the threader back and have it peel open. The thread does not shred in a low quality fashion, it&#x27;s just it may slowly peel back starting at the base of the threader, revealing a bit of hard line that not only could poke you with extra hard leverage, but perhaps contains a slightly odd, although not orally unsafe adhesive. Really I&#x27;ve only done this a few times, and I probably shouldn&#x27;t be pulling the threader backwards even though I like to. Plus it&#x27;s that internal hint of firm, waxy gel that really gives this its bend and push and makes it work so well. I&#x27;m just happy I can keep using Glide like nothing&#x27;s changed, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll keep these on hand even when I&#x27;m done with braces.</li>
    <li> Great product for bridgework</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001RU4DF0 Crest Glide Floss Picks 30 Count 4 Packs]]  Recommended by my dentist.  It is designed for those with bridge work, braces, or implants. The one-piece floss with built-in threader tip inserts easily under appliances.  I found the product easy to use and very convenient.  I highly recommend the flosser.  It comes with a 60 day manufacturer&#x27;s guarantee if not satisfied.</li>
    <li> I got these since my front teeth are bonded in the back and these work perfectly to get around that issue. Easy to get the plastic part in between the gum and the tooth, the strand doesn&#x27;t get tangled or knotted, and the length is generous. Will be buying again.</li>
    <li> We have been buying Oral B SuperFloss for years.  Oral B has apparently dropped this line and the supplier, Thornton.  Crest is also selling this new item with their logo.  The price of both new products is much higher and the quality is not near as good. The quantity per box is less, also.  Some vendors still have the better, older product in stock.  The new item works, just not as well; harder to thread.  We found the exact same older product still being sold by many other vendors under the name of the original supplier, Thornton.  Amazon sells some of Thornton&#x27;s products and hopefully, will sell the Superfloss soon under the new name.</li>
    <li> this product is excellent!  It goes great under my bridge work and works well on the rest of my teeth.  It&#x27;s all done with one  strip.  Also they are packaged individually which makes it much more sanitary.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by the dentist for kids with braces.  It works beautifully.  Packaged nicely.  This four-pack is also a far better value than is otherwise available in the local drug store.</li>
    <li> This product is always overpriced and I constantly watch for the best I can get.</li>
    <li> I had braces so now I have wires behind teeth. This is the perfect floss. Does not break and easy to use. I highly recommend it for people who have or had orthodontics treatments.</li>
    <li> I use these to floss under the wire on my bottom teeth. They work perfectly and are much easier and more convenient than anything else I have tried.</li>
    <li> This is a good product each one is individually wrapped and is like a little bag.  They are very easy to travel with and perfect for flossing around braces or retainers.</li>
    <li> The best you can get for braces. Subscribe and save very convenient. One son is already done, and this floss helped.</li>
    <li> Discovering these Glide threader single use floss packets was a treat for me.  No more losing or struggling with a plastic threader. These are easy to take with you and they make flossing a snap!</li>
    <li> Used well like my dentist would.</li>
    <li> These work very well, although they are a bit pricy.  I would recommend these to anyone who needs to use a threader for cleaning.</li>
    <li> This is a great product I have used for years. Much better than the plastic versions I have tried because they cost less. Also I don&#x27;t like plastic in my mouth. These are soft under bridges and floss end side works well on all your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I however found the cost of these going up &amp; up at local discount stores, often they were out of stock or only had one box, frustration. That being said I found these at Amazon in a pack of 4 boxes of 30. A much better price than I have seen even when I first started using many years ago. Once again&lt;br /&gt;Not having to go out shopping, having it delivered to my door, with much better prices what more could I ask for.&lt;br /&gt;This is a product I am happy using &amp; can highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I tried other devices for cleaning my bridge, but was not satisfied.  My dental hygienist recommended this, but I could not find it in local pharmacies.  Found it on Amazon and have been ordering it here ever since.  My hygienist complimented me on the condition of my teeth and gums.  Thank you Glide and Amazon!</li>
    <li> I have very close places in-between my teeth. This is the only thing that works for me and my bridge.</li>
    <li> This product does what it states with efficiency. The material does not shred and glides between tight spaces... The best of its kind!!</li>
    <li> I love this floss especially because i can not use the other ones for bridges.I am not sure why it is so expensive.No competition?</li>
    <li> I have good luck threading this floss through my bottom front teeth where I have a band to keep the teeth in place after having had braces.</li>
    <li> came on time with no problems.</li>
    <li> No problems...it is just like the excellent product sold in drugstores</li>
    <li> Great product because it gets the job done. I have used this product for several years now because it is easy to clean my teeth.</li>
    <li> I buy 5 packages at a time. This is hard to find in my local stores (Walmart &amp; CVS), so I stock up. It makes flossing under bridgework a simple process.</li>
    <li> A dental floss for between your teeth -- how unique.    What is unique about these dental threaders, is that they work!</li>
    <li> I am so happy that this product does what it says it will!  I had braces as a teenager and just got them put on again (wear your retainers!) and don&#x27;t remember finding a floss that difficult.  Using a threader and my favorite floss is so time consuming and clumsy it would take at least 20 minutes.  I tried the Platypus flossers and while it worked for the front teeth, it was next to impossible in the back, not to mention the poor quality of floss that shredds.  I also tried Super Floss which was an improvement, but it was so thick it would get stuck and made my gums bleed sometmes.  Finally, I found this Glide Floss and I&#x27;m so happy.  I wish they offered mint flavor, but who&#x27;s complaining.  I just love that this product does what it says!</li>
    <li> Bought for my two sons with braces and both regular dentist and orthodontist say they get an A+ in cleaning.  Kids like them and say they work great.</li>
    <li> I just couldn&#x27;t get the hang of those blue loops (what does that say about me?) but these are perfect. Some how I can&#x27;t seem to find them around my neck in the woods.  These give me no excuse for not flossing.</li>
    <li> My husband has used this product for several years.  Does a much better job than the regular floss. Cheaper on Amazon.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve had a bridge or some kind of adhesive laid across you teeth such that regular floss (entering from the top of the teeth) cannot work, then this floss may be the perfect solution--- stiff on one end (and very narrow) for pushing in between the teeth below the bridge or adhesive bridge but then usable like a piece of regular floss.  It can then also be used just like regular floss on the rest of the teeth.</li>
    <li> Not a huge fan as these are VERY difficult to use for teeth further back if you have a bridge.  They are not firm enough to be pushed very hard and get under tight gaps.</li>
    <li> The only threaders I use. I have a bridge on my top front teeth and these work great . I have used them for about ten years and started buying them in bulk. They are up to nine dollars per pack in stores</li>
    <li> I have a permanent retainer behind my front teeth, top and bottom.  These work great for flossing around the retainer.</li>
    <li> These are great for flossing under any kind of orthodontic bar you may have that prevents normal flossing. Much better than a seperate threader because you don&#x27;t have to put the same string of floss back into the threader for each tooth. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have two bridges and two implants and this product allows me to floss those hard to get to places.</li>
    <li> Only slightly better than the non-glide variety by Oral B. The leading tip still bends every which way when trying to thread it under my implanted denture. Someone needs to come up with a better mouse-trap for oral implant cleaning. It works great &amp;#34;IF&amp;#34; you can thread it under your implanted denture. I&#x27;m so frustrated!</li>
    <li> Everything did exactly what I wanted and I feel as if my teeth are cleaner than I ever felt with anything Else</li>
    <li> The product was exactly what I ordered and it came exactly on the time it was promised? I really like this stuff for cleaning my bridge. It is getting hard to find in my city. I am glad I have a place to order it!</li>
    <li> I have a permanent retainer and I haven&#x27;t flossed for literally years because it is such a pain to floss and I eventually ended up with gum disease. After just flossing my teeth two days in a row once a day I have already seen significant improvement in my gums. These make the process of flossing a whole lot less of a pain.</li>
    <li> An excellent manual floss for those difficult places to get between.  Perfect to carry with you as each is individually wrapped.  One end enables you to thread between teeth in those tight spots.</li>
    <li> These are really good for flossing with braces. I used Superfloss before and then Thornton 3 in 1 Floss but the thread was not waxed (I suppose) so it kept messing with the edges of brackets and the wires. I don&#x27;t have to pick floss threads with tweezers anymore. The needle type edge makes is really easy to use, I can floss much faster now. Love it.</li>
    <li> excellent for the wallet</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a huge fan of Glide floss every since it released by W.L. Gore (of Gore-Tex fame) many years ago.  (It&#x27;s probably still made by Gore, but distributed by P&amp;G.)  My teeth are so crowded that ordinary waxed floss simply would not fit; I routinely cut and shredded floss, and even when I got it through, it would \\&quot;slam\\&quot; into my gums because of the force needed.  Glide was what enabled me to be able to floss at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to get braces (again!) recently and was not looking forward to the Floss Threaders I remember from my youth (and failed to use because they were such a pain!)  While I see that the floss threaders are still sold (and my orthodontist even gave me a bunch), I&#x27;m relieved to see this product available.  I knew from experience that nothing other than Glide was going to work, so I&#x27;m happy that it exists in a version with these threaders pre-fixed to the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s expensive at twenty cents a strand, but you gotta do what you gotta do.  Proper care for your gums is simply not an option when you are in braces, especially as an adult.</li>
    <li> This is the only floss that will clean under my dental implant bridge. I would buy this product again. I like how you can slip this in your purse for on the go cleanings.</li>
    <li> I have used the product before; very happy with it, and it arrived in good condition.</li>
    <li> just what I ordered.  Perfect.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> If you have braces, you need these. Life is too short to try and thread regular floss under your braces</li>
    <li> been using these for years for my bridge an teeth</li>
    <li> Does a good job for those with bridges.</li>
    <li> If you have trouble threading floss through teeth that are too close together or due to a bridge, this is a must have. The added bonus is each one is individually wrapped so taking them on-the-go is a cinch.</li>
    <li> I have a permanent retainer behind my six front teeth on the bottom.  It has always been really hard to floss below it.  The threaders work, but this product essentially has the threader built in.  One end is rigid and can easily be threaded under the retainer.  Also my jaw is narrow and my teeth are tight.  I&#x27;ve had trouble with other similar products being too thick and getting stuck.  This product is the perfect thickness and the wax keeps it moving smoothly.</li>
    <li> These are most convenient for me (with bridges that I must go under).</li>
    <li> Not easy to find in stores, glad I know I can get the same good product that I use all the time here!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re a bridge wearer let me simply say &amp;#34;on the eighth day God created glide threader floss&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Ordered this because I could no longer find it in the drugstore.  I don&#x27;t know what they have done to it, but it now shreds and can get stuck in your teeth, totally negating the purpose of it.</li>
    <li> My once-favorite-floss is being returned.  Sigh.  I first noticed that the box was different and then saw stamped clearly on the bottom:  Made In China.  Our environmental regulations are lax enough, China&#x27;s are worse.  I don&#x27;t want to put something made in China into my mouth everyday.</li>
    <li> Only floss I will use due to a bridge, wish they weren&#x27;t so pricey but have used for years and always does the job.</li>
    <li> These are easy to thread under my bridge for cleaning there. The plastic tips are stiff enough so that I can get thread it under there my first or second try, unlike the ones i got from the dentist whose stiff end collapsed too easily.</li>
    <li> The only threader floss to use with a bridge and then be able to use as regular floss without breaking or tearing.</li>
    <li> Strong threader end. Easy to use with each strand having it&#x27;s own threader. I also think that is is thinner and easier on the gums than the double strand floss threader.</li>
    <li> Kid (9-yr-old) likes it better than regular floss, and she can thread it through the gap between the brace wire and the gum without any trouble.</li>
    <li> Inhave been using this floss for a long time. It is great if you have any partials or implants.  Very easy to use</li>
    <li> This floss works great for my braces.  It is less time consuming than the one you have to thread the regular floss through.  I would hightly recommend it.</li>
    <li> They work fine, if you get them to go through the opening, on the first try.  Otherwise they are tough to get through.  The tips could be a bit more firm, for ease of use.  All in all, a good item.</li>
    <li> These work very well for cleaning under bridges.  Much more convenient than using regular floss and having to put it through a threader.  I used to only floss under my bridge once or twice a week since it was such a hassle.  I still don&#x27;t like to do it, but I floss every night since it is easier.</li>
    <li> This simple thing solves my problem of getting the floss where it needs to go. Instead of fiddling deep inside my mouth, I can now poke the firm end of the floss thread where it needs to be, pull it through and presto.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had known about this years ago!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B003C6BS2S Oral B Super Floss Mint Strips Size: 50]]of this overpriced junk. You can get it at CVS for 1/3 of this price. The stiff end isn&#x27;t stiff enough to thread through a bridge or retainer, and once you do get it through, it&#x27;s just regular floss. The superFloss has a pipe-cleaner-like spongy material that really gets in there and fills out the fragile gap you are flossing and is much more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is way overpriced, especially for the quality. Get the Superfloss http://www.amazon.com/Oral-Super-Floss-Mint-Strips/dp/B003C6BS2S/ref&#x3D;sr_1_3?s&#x3D;hpc&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1341597941&amp;sr&#x3D;1-3&amp;keywords&#x3D;super+floss</li>
    <li> New adult braces wearer here, and boy should you be thankful if you aren&#x27;t wearing braces because flossing can be a real pain in the &amp;#I$)....if you know what I&#x27;m saying.  So, it has been a week and I got two packs of threaders to tie to my regular floss to floss between my braces and it is taking somewhere in the range of 9 years (give or take) to floss my teeth now (remind me when I can floss regularly again that I have nothing to complain about!).  Anyway, hubby got these for me and I love them.  The floss is already connected to the threader and the floss goes in between my tight teeth rather nicely.  No more tying the floss to a threader~ Yeah!  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it is still a major endeavor, but this takes a little bit of the hassle out of it and glide makes great floss that lasts through the whole flossing without fraying or breaking.  Thanks for making such an awesome product!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Expensive but worth it if you have braces. Very convenient packaging for single use on-the-go.</li>
    <li> Nice to buy it in bulk, although not a great savings in $$ a great savings in convenience.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a dentist and I purchased these for my mother to clean under her bridgework.  This product is similar to superfloss which I can no longer find on the market.  She doesn&#x27;t take the time to used floss threaders.  This product is great for her and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> My son started using these while he had the brace.  You can thread this in between the braces easily.  Now he is out of braces but still prefers this.</li>
    <li> Came fast and it works. Ideal for braces it&#x27;s easy to slip behind them and get inbetween the teeth. Love it</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended these to me a few years ago for my bridge. In the past I had to use those threaders with regular floss and I always hated to floss. These handy flossers make it so easy and with less mess. I&#x27;ve used the Oral B super floss that other reviewers mention here and I liked that as well. These fill the need and I&#x27;ll use as long as necessary to keep my teeth healthy.</li>
    <li> Each box contains 30 packets with one piece of floss each.  I have two crowns welded together and a bridge-like implant that need to be flossed.  The Glide threader floss had a stiff end that allows me to insert the floss between the welded crowns and into the bridge-like implant.  Regular floss threaders are not as stiff and sometimes they are flimsy and don&#x27;t do the job.  I discovered these because my dentist puts a couple of packets in a &amp;#34;goody&amp;#34; bag when I leave.</li>
    <li> This has become a regular item in my bathroom closet. the quality of the product is really good. I will order this regularly.</li>
    <li> This product is great.  It makes cleaning under dental appliances/bridges very easy.  Much easier than cutting off a piece of floss and putting it into a threader and then putting the threader under the appliance.  This is all one piece, including the floss, all ready to be used right out of the package.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Great product. Better than similar products I have tried because it is thinner. Item arrived promptly.</li>
    <li> Good for dental flossing for implants, it&#x27;s strong and is a very good bargain at 30 per box for daily flossing.</li>
    <li> These are great for flossing if you have a permanent bridge. My dentist gave me some little plastic threaders to use with normal floss, but they&#x27;re expensive to buy more of. With these, you have floss and a little stiff end that you can slide under your bridge so you can floss under there. The bonus is that they come in little individual envelopes, so you can carry one in your wallet and have floss with you on the go!</li>
    <li> This is the best product for flossing under your partials. It is very convenient and helps motivate me to floss daily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Glide Threader Floss since I&#x27;ve needed it, and it has always helped me in getting good news when I go in to the dentist for cleaning.  It is easy to use and with brushing makes my mouth feel fresh and clean.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands and methods, but always come back to this one.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Really handy, especially if you have a bridge or partial you need to get under.</li>
    <li> I have been using Glide threader floss for a couple of years but it is hard to find in the stores.  I was lucky to find it on Amazon!  If you have bridge work or teeth that are so close together that your floss breaks...give this a try.  Each piece is packaged separately so you can carry them conveniently in your purse or pocket.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Good threader for bridge. Better the other one with puffy surface and also it&#x27;s individual pack so good for travel.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.  They don&#x27;t work at all.  Just by the GUM brand threaders - they are fine.</li>
    <li> Gets in between my implants and never looked back since. I use them everyday because the best dental visits are prepared dental visits. Great.</li>
    <li> these are helpful for your child with orthodontic wires, etc to work around&lt;br /&gt;expensive, but worth it to keep those teeth flossed</li>
    <li> This stuff makes flossing so much easier when you&#x27;re trying to get around any type of dental appliance, be it bridges, braces or permanent retainers.</li>
    <li> This floss was recommended by my hygienist.  It is so convenient buying it in large quantities, at a savings, than buying individual boxes in drugstores, or supermarkets.  Only kind I use.</li>
    <li> This is very convenient and easily to slide. They are individually pack so it is pretty easy to carry them in my small purse. love it.</li>
    <li> Product is what I was looking for to use for flossing under my permanent bridge(crown/implant/crown) that my DDS had recommended. Now that I know you carry it, will order larger quantity to get volume discount. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Great for folks with braces, permanent retainers or if you just plain can&#x27;t get floss between your teeth.  Sooo much more convenient and easier to use than the little blue plastic loops.</li>
    <li> This is the easiest floss threader I have ever used, far and away, but a bit pricey on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Best price here, easy to use under bridges, and around implants, and really do a thorough job.</li>
    <li> I have two bridges in the front of my mouth, I use to use the threaders with floss and all that, but these things, they are gold! They are the best things I have ever found! They slide between my bridges and my gums comfortably and glide with ease.</li>
    <li> These were orthodontist recommended.  We tried them but also tried another brand.  Really were not happy with the other brand. There is a reason your orthodontist recommends these (we found out the hard way).  These are the best.  Teenager actually remembers to floss and never has a problem with the floss fraying or getting stuck. This is the best floss for braces, by far.  5 thumbs up.</li>
    <li> This product combines a threader with a comfortably thin floss to reach difficult areas between teeth.Fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;Saves money and fuss.</li>
    <li> These are so handy with braces. The little threaders work, but they take forever to use and it already takes too much time to deal with braces. These are easy-peasy, the built in stiff end slips through and fairly easy to grab again. They seem to be the perfect length too. Very good things to have.</li>
    <li> I have used these for years.  They are great</li>
    <li> This glide threader floss works great. I got a sample from my dentist and decided to use it regularly for getting under a permanent wire that I have. My only complaint is that this floss is a bit pricey.</li>
    <li> I use this product several times a day and have used it for several years.  I have many crowns and find that this product helps to keep my gums healthy.</li>
    <li> I have several teeth as well as implants that require a threader. Glide, in my opinion, makes a superior product and I highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> The end of the floss is made more rigid where it is double back on itself and joined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a permanent fixed retainer, and these make getting between the teeth and under the retainer very simple. My teeth are close together, but these fit effortless between my teeth without bending.&lt;br /&gt;For those of us with fixed retainers, it is not uncommon to have dental floss snag on the retainer and shred. I&#x27;ve found this floss much less likely to shred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste is refreshing mint, not overpowering, just enough to make the experience pleasant.</li>
    <li> Great product. Occasionally it can splinter. It splinters about 8% of the time. Otherwise, the concept of the product is great and it fullfills it&#x27;s basic needs requirements.</li>
    <li> I am totally satisfied  thank you</li>
    <li> An easy way to floss your teeth without using threaders.</li>
    <li> Works better than the super floss - the threader is more reliable whereas the super floss doesn&#x27;t work some times.</li>
    <li> I have used threader floss in the past, but I would only use it for the permanent retainer I have as it was too thick and would get stuck between my teeth near the back of my mouth. This floss is more rubber-like than thread-like so I am able to use it through my entire mouth without any breakage, the downside is that the floss is so smooth that I dont think it cleans quite as well as the thread-like floss I was using previously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The individual use packets are nice as they stop my box of floss from looking like an Guinness record attempt at biggest floss ball.</li>
    <li> Wife didn&#x27;t like them...said they didn&#x27;t work on her bridge</li>
    <li> I have been using the Glide Threader Floss for many years and have found this to be very efficient in keeping the teeth behind my retainers clean. However, with my last order, the coating on the floss is breaking down in pieces and I&#x27;m finding myself having to pick the white coating pieces out of my gums. So before I use the threader floss, I rub it between my fingers to smooth out the coating pieces so as to not get in my teeth. I will be checking into other flossing products if this continues to be a problem. This is disappointing, as I really like this floss.</li>
    <li> This product is great for going under bridges but if frays too easily.  Our dentist suggested a more substantial Oral-B product.</li>
    <li> I like these better than normal floss.  Makes it easy to get in there when the gap isn&#x27;t that wide.</li>
    <li> As an adult with first braces and now a permanent retainer, I love this floss. It makes flossing very easy. They are not always available in local stores and the price via Amazon is cheaper than buying locally. My gums are happy.</li>
    <li> These individual packets are great for travel or for keeping in your purse. However, because the floss is waxed, it seems pretty slippery for regular flossing. The threader feature works great.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by my dentist. It works well removing plaque in between teeth, crowns and implants.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an adult with braces, and I&#x27;ve tried other types of threader floss, including Oral-B.  They all get stuck in the brackets and shred, except this one.  The Glide floss holds up well while flossing with my braces.  This is the only floss I can use.</li>
