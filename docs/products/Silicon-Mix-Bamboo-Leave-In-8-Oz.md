<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My hairdresser introduced me to this product. A sales rep suggested that he try it and because my hair is very thick black hair he called me to come in to give it a test run. It is amazing how soft my hair feels when I use it. I use it after a wash and use of a rinse out conditioner of the same brand. And to top it off, it smells so wonderful. I integrate it with jojoba oil and another leave in conditioner on wet hair and then twist. My hair is soft and silky</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  I have coarse, thick, dry hair. This leave-in conditioner makes it so soft and it smells wonderful.  I also used the other Silicon Mix Leave-In conditioner and that one is even better for my hair.  It gives my hair slip and softness.  The Silicon Bamboo Leave-In smells better than the original Silicon Mix Leave-In.  I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> Does what&#x27;s it says and leaves hair very soft</li>
    <li> My hair stylist recommended me this product. I am very happy with the conditioner and also with the service provided by Healthlink: very professional, great assistance and advantageous prices!</li>

    <li> I have been using this product for awhile now. I originally got it where I get my hair cut. It leaves your hair really soft and holds the style in place without feeling stiff or sticky. Not to mention the great Amazon price and convenience</li>
    <li> A great leave-in.  Very moisturizing. I am natural with 3b/3 hair.  This is now the only leave - in I use.</li>
    <li> Works great on curly hair keeps it&#x27;s smooth and clean feeling, love this product. I found it through my hair stylest. Makes her manageable.</li>
    <li> I use this on my kids hair, which is curly and unruly, and it&#x27;s amazing. The products smooths hair and leaves a great smell.</li>
    <li> great scent, very light</li>
    <li> I tried this on my mothers hair and she loved it. It made her hair feel so soft. I&#x27;m glad I tried something new. Great product!</li>
    <li> Ok! I tried this once and it left my hair heavy. It&#x27;s works good.  But I may have used too much or something. This product is good tho.</li>
    <li> my hair died of  thirst</li>
    <li> Silicon Mix Bamboo Leave-In is one of the best leave-in I tried in a long time. I have tried many!! All the Silicon Mix leave-in are fantastic. If your have unmanageable hair, hair that is dry and hard to comb through, this is the perfect leave-in for you. It makes the hair moisturized and adds strength to your hair. It helps when blow drying. I use the entire Silicon Mix Bamboo line. The shampoo,treatment,leave-in. Its one of the best from the Silicon Mix lines. I give the entire Silicon Mix Bamboo line out as xmas gifts. People luv it.</li>
    <li> I liked this product better than any other I have used in the past. Just a little goes a long way. Doesn&#x27;t leave hair oilly.</li>
    <li> Ok so I&#x27;ve been using the cantu shea butter leave-in conditioner for a while but I ran out recently. I was without a leave-in conditioner for a while and then I finally decided on this one. OMG I love this moisturizer!! My hair is so silky soft and NOT GREASY!! I can&#x27;t get enough of it. I like it much better than the cantu. The cantu leave it was alright it did it&#x27;s job but I felt as though it kinda make my hair a bit stiff. Anyway I so love this conditioner I just wish that I there was a bigger bottle.</li>
    <li> So far I like the silicon products and planning to buy more. The bamboo added is a plus.  I have gray frizzy hair and between the kanechom  and silicon products I&#x27;m traveling in the right direction.</li>
    <li> I love the repairing conditioner from the same company and so I bought the leave in conditioner thinking that it would be just as good...all I can say is &amp;#34;eh&amp;#34;.  It tends to leave my hair looking really greasy but at the same time it&#x27;s really sticky.  I say don&#x27;t waste your money here, just buy the repairing conditioner.</li>
    <li> This leave-in conditioner did nothing for my hair.  So I stopped using it.  It didnt make my hair soft or stronger, etc.  There are better things on the market.</li>
    <li> I live in Hawaii and am at the beach several times a week. Before I bought this product, my hair would get dried out and stiff after swimming in the ocean. Now, I rub the conditioner into my hair before I get in the water, and when I come out my hair is still silky and smooth. This is a must-have protection from harsh salt water.</li>
    <li> Its not like a conditioner and smells great and makes my hair so SOFT and not so fly away!!  I will buy this product again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s in this leave-in that seems to make it better than the ones in a drugstore but it works better. We have 90+ degree days in the summer and it helps keep my hair manageable without the buildup.</li>
    <li> Great Product/Great Price!</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a second thought because my main purpose was to get the silicon mix hair treatment.  Unlike the other, I am still using this.  This product consistently makes my hair smooth, shiny, and more manageable.  I will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Best product for moisture and shine while still keeping hair lightweight. Will def buy more</li>
    <li> Smells great and it gives my hair a bit of texture.</li>
    <li> Need me a case of this hair crack just wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey</li>
    <li> fast delivery, great buy</li>
    <li> I use to use Kinky Girl Hair leave-in conditioner, but this is clearly better.  You will notice the differnce immediately.</li>
    <li> Great product, Ive been using it for 3 years and my hair loves it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product about three times now, and I have not seen any difference in the feel or moisture of my hair.</li>
