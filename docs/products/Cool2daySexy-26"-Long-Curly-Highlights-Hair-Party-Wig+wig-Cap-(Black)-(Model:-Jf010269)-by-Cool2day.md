<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Bad and sheds everywhere like an animal. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t look like the picture, And is very thin. U get what u pay for. If your African-American this wig will not fit you.</li>
    <li> Just got this wig in the mail.  I figured for the price, it was going to be something I would only wear once for a costume party and then throw away.  What a surprise.  Beautiful, natural looking wig.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I was very unsatisfied with the product. When I received it i tried it on , tried to run my fingers through that was a fail. Then I tried to play around with it lightly brush through it and it still wasnt right. I do not recomnend anywho to purchase this item.</li>
    <li> first of all it took about 45 days for me to recieve,then itwas the wrong color.then they contavted me to resolve the matter, but gave me the run around. they wanted me to send the wig back and send them the sku of the right one which i sent the sku 3 times threw email. they said once they recieve the one i have back they would send me the right one, which would take two months which was about the same time i recieved the product it self.in the end i just gave up and kept the product, which was nice but not the color i asked for.</li>
    <li> meh. on the 3rd day my wig got tangled and couldnt use it anymore. Looks pretty synthetic in real life. It was just meant to compliment my costume anyways and it did just that so its all good.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love wearing my hair differently, so I definitely knew I&#x27;d purchase this wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received it, I was very excited! I was going to use it for an interview I had because I didn&#x27;t want to do my own hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looked good for about 30 minutes and then it started to tangle. It feels plastic (because it is), but the length is amazing. I like it for play but I wouldn&#x27;t wear it everyday or every other day.</li>
    <li> I like it very much . it is super natural looking wig.curly and so soft and abundant hair . Iam very pleased with my purchase</li>
    <li> Not good quality at all!!!</li>
    <li> Used for a party not for everyday. Quality  is not that good but fair for what you paid and fast shipping</li>
    <li> Everyone thought it was my hair. I received a lot of complements and I plan to wear again. Excellent for the price.</li>
    <li> This wig was horrible it literally tangled as I took it out of the package and applied it to my head. It is indeed a synthetic wig but I have MANY synthetic wigs that are of better quality than this. This wig seemed to be made of pure plastic and thread. If you&#x27;re looking for a wig to wear for a party then this is it. For any other use surely not. It was so horrible I actually threw it away -_- But you do get what you pay for so hey. But it will not look all nice like the model it&#x27;s VERY tangly and unruly. Just don&#x27;t buy this. Save yourself he change.</li>
    <li> very easy to order. the wig is very nice. the fibers look very natural. the cut is beautiful. i would definatly order from them again!</li>
    <li> This wig is beautiful, its long, silky to the touch, i really recommend you buying this, its just exactly what i wanted and it came with a free wig cap which is really cute (: PLEASE DONT HESITATE TO BUY THIS! or any of their other products</li>
    <li> This by far was the worst wig I have ever saw. It smelled bad. I was scared to even place it on my head. Looked gray/black. Had a waxy feel to it. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this at all. Ever!</li>
    <li> THIS WAS MY FIRST WIG I BOUGHT AND I WAS UPSET CAUSE IT WAS NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE AND IT FELT DIRTY, AND AND I WASHED IT WITH COLD WATER AND STILL FELT BAD. AND IT HAD A VERY SHINNY TO IT WHERE IT LOOK SO FAKE, I WAS UPSET THAT I WAS THAT MONEY, BUT I FOUND A BETTER PLACE TO BY WIG. AND IT BY GIRLHAIRDO.COM AND SHE HAD BETTER WIG, LITTLE MORE PRICEY BUT I RATHER SPEND A LITTLE MORE TO GET BETTER WIG</li>
    <li> Love how long and thick this wig is, I am impressed with the fast delivery and the fullness of the wig. I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
    <li> Wig needs frequent brushings. Seems like even the wind blowing will make it tangle, so be sure to invest in a proper wig brush.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS WIG!!! Its a great fit on me &amp; everyone who has seen it on me has had nothing but positive comments about it. I have a feeling this one will be the first of many to come...especially since I&#x27;ve already started on my hunt for more &amp; not just for myself, for my friends as well. I had planned on adding a customer picture to the product&#x27;s ad. However, I don&#x27;t see where I can do that at.</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because I have a long torso (nope), but the length of the wig isn&#x27;t as long as I like it to be. Base on the the photo, it should be waist long. Oh well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, the quality of the wig is very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery of this product was on time. Perhaps next time I&#x27;ll ask for the length.</li>
    <li> Love this wig! This was my first wig and I&#x27;m glad I got this one. I definitely recommend it. Little to no shedding too.</li>
    <li> This wig has become my favorite and with good reason. It is incredibly soft and real looking. It&#x27;s fairly long too which is nice. The wig doesn&#x27;t shed too bad so that&#x27;s always a plus. The bangs were just a touch too long so I put them to the side and it still looked great. The shipping was fast and the wig came in perfect condition and virtually untangled when pulled out. The wig also has a nice wavy/ curl to it but after combing it, it&#x27;s curls were nice and subtle which was what I wanted. Overall im very satisfied and would buy more . I&#x27;d recommend it</li>
    <li> This hair is so soft, so smooth and so easily tangled! The cap itself didn&#x27;t fit, it was like I had a small cap sitting on my head, so I was afraid to be around people or close to objects that it migh hook up on and get pulled off. *Sigh* And its such a lovely wig! Oh well.</li>
    <li> I am a bit of a hair addict &amp; I own many wigs but, this is my new \\&quot;Go To\\&quot; wig! When nothing else looks right, this is always the one I end up wearing! I trimmed the bangs but, outside of that, it needed no fussing! Because of the length, it will shed strands but, it really doesn&#x27;t tangle badly. I have been able to style it &amp; even wear it in updo styles without any telltale signs that its not really my hair. I love it!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite wigs. It get tangled very easily but it looks realistic and the length is perfect. I&#x27;m short so it reaches my hips</li>
    <li> I just recieved my wig yesterday and it really was true to the one-two day shipping. I was very pleased. I certainly wasnt disapointted with the outcome. No tangles for me really and the length is great. Works well with heat as well. Id recommend this seller.</li>
    <li> Yes, I really love this wig. It came much sooner than expected and was everything I hoped for...soft, sleek, sexy. Minor shedding when I brushed it out, but not too bad. It looks great on, fits well, lovely black color, pretty wavy curls, and flows nicely. I&#x27;m very excited to wear it at my next photoshoot...and even out to play! Great wig and I definitely would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Color was great, excatly what I thought it would be. Good for daily wear or for a night out, fun</li>
    <li> This wig is really thick! The bangs are perfect and the waves are super cute! It is really long too! The length is about to my waist down the back! As always, Cool2Day&#x27;s wigs are super soft! The fibers are thin, so I would recommend getting a med-wide tooth plastic comb and a detangler. I use Herbal essences Curl Silkening Detangler (the purple one). If you want thick bangs on a wig, go with Cool2Day&#x27;s party series! I have ordered several of Cool2Day&#x27;s wigs, and the party series is by far the best! Good luck, and happy shopping.</li>
    <li> I like this wig but the bangs are just to thick an a little short . But other then that it&#x27;s fun to wear . Great price . Came early upon delivery . I like this wig for going out .</li>
    <li> I received my item on-time, but it wasn&#x27;t what I had expected...I thought that I was getting a wig w/bangs as the picture showed, but when I received it and tried it on there were no bands. I just need to be a little more careful when I order items online to read the details more closely.</li>
    <li> The hair feels natural and I buy wig A LOT so... I felt like posting a picture and writing a review would help people make this decision... I had to see actual photos in order to buy one... its nice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had short fine curly hair. Now i can rock long hair. Seriously love it. Minor shedding yes, it can tangle a bit when fooling around in it but am using a wide toothed comb so its fine. OOO i got bangs.</li>
    <li> It was perfect. I loved the length. This is the first hair piece that was really full which made it seem more natural. I was very pleased.</li>
    <li> So my wig came today. Not much to say about it other than the fact that shedding is minimum. Starting to tangle and it&#x27;s getting kinky at the bottom. All in all nice wig for the money. Its sewn on a wig cap which works. Looks like the picture, so I can&#x27;t complain. But bangs are entirely too long. It&#x27;s annoying. Comes to my waist so I don&#x27;t have to worry about the length. Will I order from this seller again maybe. Hopefully it lasts til December.</li>
    <li> The Bad: So when it finally arrived, which took forever (no shipping info either). It was not exactly what you&#x27;d expect.&lt;br /&gt;The bangs are WAY too long to be worn as shown in the picture, the hair is probably 4 inches shorter than it is supposed to be, and it isn&#x27;t really a skin cap like it&#x27;s supposed to be.&lt;br /&gt;The hair is sooooo thin, like I&#x27;ve been buying wigs for years and this is like 25% the weight of any other wig.&lt;br /&gt;It looks really fake, so you should powder it with corn starch and brush it thoroughly to make it look less plastic.&lt;br /&gt;It is really small, like made for a child&#x27;s head, it&#x27;s manageable but uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good: The thin material is actually okay if you have problems with wigs tangling, because it is easy to comb through.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s too long to wear as bangs but it makes a nice side fringe if you style it.&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t thick like normal wigs, so it&#x27;s easy to put into a bun or pony tail.&lt;br /&gt;The price is okay, although amazon has some much better wigs for much less money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you want a natural looking wig; don&#x27;t buy it&lt;br /&gt;if you want a long wig; don&#x27;t buy it&lt;br /&gt;if you want bangs; don&#x27;t buy it.&lt;br /&gt;If you want a cheap, good enough dress up wig; buy it&lt;br /&gt;if you want really thin hair; buy it.</li>
    <li> Bangs are long but the wig is quite nice.</li>
    <li> Super Cute and SOFT! I love this wig. Its a very dark black and shiny. Thickness is great! Not super curly but curly,</li>
    <li> Great hair and love the way it looks. It&#x27;s really priced low to be such a great wig.  My favorite wig!!!</li>
    <li> I read so many mixed reviews regarding this wig...However I tried it anyways. For the price I&#x27;d day you get what you pay for.  Pros: thick but NOT too thick, curly pattern is nice, color is nice natural looking. Cons: VERY easily tangled, bangs aren&#x27;t cut very well, wig cap is small, hair feels like plastic. Overall I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for anything other than a costume.</li>
    <li> When i bought this product i thought wow this is so gorgeous but when it finally came i was really disappointed because it was definitely eay shorter than what the picture  shows and it sheds like crazy..  It also bothers me because it always got tangles in my earrings..  This wig made me feel really insecure..  So i do not recommend this wig to anyone..  It barely fit on my head and the bangs were too short for me. It looks really  fake to.  So if i could give it a zero star a would.</li>
    <li> Its ok. Just sheds a little and tangles very easy. Otherwise i hust use a large comb on it. the bangs are abit too long though can be annoying at times.</li>
    <li> This wig I purchased is just beautiful. It&#x27;s long and soft. I have no complaints. It arrived the expected date even though we had a snow storm. Will order order again soon.</li>
    <li> I love the look but the thing is. I thought the wig would have been a lot more full it&#x27;s ok for going out and stuff but I&#x27;m kinda disappointed. I&#x27;m black and I have been wearing wigs since I was in high school and I&#x27;m 23 now so I know what I&#x27;m talking about. Oh well better luck next time I hope.I think we&#x27;re bugs me the most is that the tracks in the back him out and I&#x27;ve always had to wake brothers should have been extremely gentle with my way which is why it takes me forever to brush them out just wish it would have lasted longer</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly. Shed a lot and tangled no matter how many times I combed or brushed. Matted up in the back. Overall looks good initially for the price but a lot of upkeep to keep it looking nice after the first few days. Would purchase another for a temporary look but cannot use this long term</li>
    <li> Sucked! The bangs are too flat, it tangles after 1st wear, the ends are terrible &amp; it sheds tooo much...i turned this into a around the house wig. This will soon make it to the garbage.</li>
    <li> When I ordered this wig, it looked the one the in the picture, but the one I got was torn and full of tangles already, like it had been roughly handled before packaged. The quality of the hair really isn&#x27;t that great either.</li>
    <li> It is not the same wig as advertised. It&#x27;s much thinner, shorter, and the bang is not deep.&lt;br /&gt;The cap is fit so a small childs head not for an average circumference adults crown.</li>
    <li> this wig has a lot of track view in the bag but it easy to get on and looks gorgeous</li>
    <li> This wig was one of my first wigs I bought a couple of years ago, and have bought this wig two other times because I really like it. It&#x27;s affordable and if you take care of it really well it can last you at least a month. It wasn&#x27;t a perfect fit for me because I&#x27;ve come to realize I have a big head, but the wig is full and long, so as long as it isn&#x27;t too windy it&#x27;s fine for me. I even can wear a beanie over it and i won&#x27;t have to worry about it falling off or showing the wig cap. It does shed quite a bit, but I don&#x27;t find it a big deal. It will eventually get very tangly and frizzy at the bottom, so cutting it would be best or you can braid the wig in two pigtails and wear it like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My initial reason for buying this wig was for an anime convention, but eventually fell in love with the wig and started wearing it out on regular days. It doesn&#x27;t look obviously fake, and I had countless times where people would comment on how beautiful my hair was, and when I told them it was a wig they were amazed, and they wanted to buy one too just from seeing mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always received this wig very fast, about 2-3 days, and am always happy with the product I get. The wig is obviously not a long lasting wig, but for the price I think it&#x27;s pretty damn awesome. ^_^</li>
    <li> When I opened the plastic packaging, I was happy to note that it came with a mesh wig cap, and I wouldn&#x27;t have to be buying one. The wig is encased in a thin netting so it holds shape and doesn&#x27;t tangle in shipping/storage process. after removing it, the curls and wig tumbled out virtually UNTANGLED. The wig has a VERY realistic look and the texture and feel are extremely high quality for the price. It isn&#x27;t super shiny and friberous looking like most synthetics. It is a full and thick wig and looks almost identical to the picture. After putting on the wig cap and securing the wig on my head it fit snugly but not overly so. The strap to help it stay on is great. I am about 5&#x27;4&amp;#34; and the longest parts fall to just above my belly button. The wigs is cute, you can&#x27;t see the seams. The ONLY problem I really have with the item is that the bangs are very long and thick (which I like) but sort of have a &amp;#34;bowl cut&amp;#34; feel to them. So I will probably end up thinning them out and making them look less like a wig. Overall though, for 8$ and free shipping as an add on I would definitely buy from Cool2day again!</li>
    <li> Great quality and true to the image!</li>
    <li> Ok I just got this hair and I love it, I was not expecting it to come so soon it is coming from oversea, it so soft to the touch and you can&#x27;t beat the price love it</li>
    <li> this is a very good quality wig and i wear it all the time!!!&lt;br /&gt;i will purchase again great party wig!!</li>
    <li> Im really mad its been more then a month since i placed my order for 2 off there wigs with Cool2day and i havent got anything in the mail i placed my order in June 24 and its already August 14 and i havent recieved nothing im never going to purchase anything with this seller its all Bullshit and they just steal ur money.!!!</li>
    <li> i thought this wig was going to b the best wig ever and i was so wrong this pic the wig has a bang i got this wig and there wasnt a bang it was all together i had to cut the wig it was crazy i cant even cut good</li>
    <li> Look really bad on me. Very cheap but my friend liked it and I gave it to her. Not a total waste like my other wig purchase.</li>
    <li> This wig is ok, I wish it looked better on me but it really doesnt fit my face, its really no big deal though it didnt cost a lot so I will just say that the wig is soft and the wig does look like real hair</li>
    <li> Very cheaply made wig</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. But hey u get what u pay for. I read the reviews and I should a listened. Got tangled and was hard to untangle. Lasted maybe 3 days tops. I don&#x27;t recommend it unless u want fast and only plan on wearing once or twice</li>
    <li> I was all excited about this wig..timing wasnt bad..package was really neat but to be honest i wasnt too thrilled..It got tangled jusy to try it on..all in all it wasnt a bad wig..I catch it to the side with a nice clip and got lots of compliments..Also wish i could ave gotten a longer wear from it but jst ciuldnt be bother with all the tangle :-)</li>
    <li> Better quality than I thought it would be. On time and no damage.</li>
    <li> Cute! Worked perfect with my Kagome cosplay!</li>
    <li> The wig that I recv&#x27;d was not thick at all. I guess I didn&#x27;t really expect much for a wig under $10. I&#x27;d say if you want to keep it around for a while, spend the extra money and get a better quality, thicker wig. I can see the cap through on the top and the shedding is too much, resulting in even more cap showing.</li>
    <li> For the price it was great value.  I wanted it for Halloween and it will work fine.&lt;br /&gt;Looks like good quality for the price.&lt;br /&gt;GREAT PURCHASE....thanks</li>
    <li> Used this as a vampire wig for my daughter&#x27;s costume, she needs an adult sized wig as she has extremely thick hair to cover. This wig fit securely and did not fall off through an entire day at school as well as a second round during trick or treating. Has an ok sheen to it, some people thought it looked really natural on her but I thought it looked a little bit more costume-y.</li>
    <li> VERY EASY TO WEAR. DID RECEIVED ALOT OF COMPLIMENTS. WILL DEFINITELY BUY ANOTHER ONE. ITS ALSO EASY TO CURL. IM USING SPONGE ROLLERS</li>
    <li> I was really excited to receive this wig! It was so promising online, but when i got it i was a bit disappointed. The bangs are super flat, but the length is amazing, and it is really full. The fit is nice, but the whole reason for buying it was the full looking bangs. Probally would not reccommend this specific one to a friend.</li>
    <li> I got this wig to try out having black hair. The hair is soft and really feels like natural hair! The bangs were waaay to long and very uneven, and I had to trim them, but now it looks good- just like in the picture. It&#x27;s easy to comb through, and I suggest that you do that regularly, with a wide-tooth comb or a wig brush, otherwise, you will have a tangled mess on your head! The length is exactly as pictured. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;6\\&quot;, and it goes down almost to my waist. For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it! You can wear it for cosplay, or even out on the street. It does look that real!</li>
    <li> Ok in a few short word black wigs don&#x27;t look good on me they tangle in minutes after putting it on a horrible chop job on the wig all in all hated it it&#x27;s only $6.00 dollars get cheap but cheap never again now all my wigs come from the US</li>
    <li> Bought it for my best friend and it was shipped to her. She absolutely loves it! I would buy it again for her.</li>
    <li> this wig makes me look good it was worth buying and I use it from time to time whatever mood i&#x27;m in</li>
    <li> I just ordered 2 of these units&lt;br /&gt;I can not wait to get them&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again for a great unit!</li>
    <li> this one wass my favorite ,looked reallly cute on me and once it tangled i was able to flat iron it and it still looked good.i would do this one again and everyone loved it!</li>
    <li> Guess I should not have had high hopes for the price...wanted it for new years wore it once and it tangled up real bad. It does not even look natural what so ever looks no where as good as the picture...for petes sake it came in a bag rolled up! Does not deserve any stars actually,</li>
    <li> Very cute wig they didn&#x27;t send me the right color but other then that&lt;br /&gt;I was very happy with it.</li>
    <li> i really like this wig, it is nice wig and its affordable, they also gave me an accessory and a wig cap as a gift, would definatley order more.</li>
    <li> the wig is ok, good material, but it really looks more curly than it looks on image</li>
    <li> Its cheap so you get what you pay for. I order it in jet black it came in a light brown. Not happy with it... I&#x27;ll leave it at that!</li>
    <li> The wig isn&#x27;t really that much so it is worth the price. It took me awhile to play with it to get it how I wanted it. I didn&#x27;t cut it or anything, but I love it. I thought it would have been thicker, but it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> For the price it&#x27;s a great wig it&#x27;s kinda thin but guess most wigs can&#x27;t be like thick hair hah but all in all a good wig</li>
    <li> The actual wig is much, much curlier than in the picture! It is also shorter and has very thin bangs!</li>
    <li> This is like a costume wig shiny and sheds a ton like unwearable unless you want to be shedding everywhere</li>
    <li> i wish I would have listened to all the negative review.The bangs is so limp and just taking it out of the bag tangled it up and it started shedding. I want to know how I can get this back to you (seller/PDA) and get my money back. I mean seriously its like wearing a shiny thick black mop.</li>
    <li> This was a great hair piece.  I will definitely buy another one and will be recommending to my friends.... ok</li>
    <li> Hardly tangles. Great for the price.. feels like real hair! Better than any Halloween wig by far! Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Really awesome wig, its great quality, exactly like the picture, and well priced. I would really recommend buying this wig~!</li>
    <li> Sexy mama, that&#x27;s how I feel when I wear this wig.</li>
    <li> The fibers are soft, the bangs come unstyled, and it doesn&#x27;t shed all that much. It isn&#x27;t too shiny or anything. I wore it the first day I got my new glasses and nobody immediately recognized me, which was very fun. Overall I love this wig and wearing it was a blast,</li>
    <li> This wig was good for the price. It held up for the event it was needed for. It tangled all bit but it was manageable.</li>
    <li> I do not like this wig get tangled quick too shiny and look very fake instead of natural I would not buy this again</li>
    <li> I love it it comes with a cool hair net and the wig looks real not like a s***ty halloween wig good price and cute wig!!</li>
    <li> This was certainly worth the price. The product arrived looking exactly as it does in the picture. The fibers are extremely soft and do not fall out of the wig. The wig is a tad bit thin for my preferences, so if you prefer thick wigs, this might not be the product for you. Like most new wigs, this wig has the \\&quot;new wig shine\\&quot;. Give it a little time and it will appear more natural.</li>
    <li> I got the wig alot sooner then I thought I would:)But it is not as thick as I thought it would be. But the bangs are perfect! The hair is soooo soft it&#x27;s very pretty! The only reason it is not a 5 is because the picture had me to believe it&#x27;d be a little thicker.But I&#x27;ll live. I would but it again and love wearing it out</li>
    <li> Okay,well when I ordered this wig I already knew that for the price I would have to be extra gentle with it,due to the low quality.When I received my wig in the mail in just a few days after ordering it,I was pleased.At the time that I opened the box,I was hoping that it wasn&#x27;t too short,since I&#x27;ve had that issue with wigs in the past.My hair is in the process from growing out,but due to the fact that I must improve my diet,along with vitamins &amp; supplements that I&#x27;m open to trying like Biotin &amp; MSM,this wig is needed.So far,I would have to say that if you are not a person with a less then average sized head (smaller then 22-23 in) then this wig will NOT fit you,When I put it on,even if I had no hair at all,this wig would NOT fit on me all the way.It took all of the pulling in the world in order for me to get this thing to where no one would laugh at me.This thing was obviously made for girls who have naturally smaller heads,since it came from China.If you have any sort of job or activity that involves a lot of movement or strenuous activity,buy another wig.Also,this wig will tangle more then any other wig I&#x27;ve ever bought.They must have used the cheapest fibers that they possibly could in order to create this wig.I&#x27;m quite disappointed with the quality of this wig,but I purchased it with the expectation that it wasn&#x27;t the best.I&#x27;m not sure if I can even wear this wig outside,unless I pull the hair into a ponytail,its so thin.The thickness of the fibers of this wig are average at best,so I wouldn&#x27;t swing the hair around too much.When I tried to detangle the fibers of the wig,they were stuck together like glue,so I had to be very careful.The bangs are not flat across as in the picture,they are more so off to the side so you can hardly see them.Personally,unless you have a very large budget,I would stay away from human hair wigs,&amp; just stick with properly made synthetic wigs.Note that the length of the wig was exactly what I was looking for,&amp; the color was correct.I wouldn&#x27;t suggest keeping this as your only wig unless you can&#x27;t buy another one,since its so cheap.There are better brands out there,but for the price that I paid for this wig,I wish I had saved the money.</li>
    <li> this item shed like crazy and it look so fake with a funny smell to it.  it tangle very easily and look nothing like the model wearing it.  will not buy cheap wig again!</li>
    <li> i absolutely love this wig, it is great for dressing in drag and helps make the outfit even more convincing but it does tangle easily.</li>
    <li> I waited a long time for this to ship from China, but I was surprised at the quality when I received it. I bought it for a costume. It&#x27;s actually really nice and for those folks who do wear real wigs, you could probably pass this one off as an expensive wig. Very nice.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite wigs I wore this past Christmas time and I had a lot of fun wearing it.  I gave me a super sexy look in a very professiona. way.</li>
    <li> This wig wasnt for me I wore it once and couldnt stand it I wish it would have worked out but it didnt.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I try a wig, just for fun. I choose this one because it match what I want, long curly black one and the price is nice. The fringe is too long for me, so I trim it a little bit. After that I take a lot of pictures, quite fun. But seems like it&#x27;s easy to knot, and I feel itch on my neck after that. In a word, it‘s worth but not perfect.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s O.K.,not as good as others i&#x27;ve got but allright..I wouldn&#x27;t buy another.I don&#x27;t love the way the  bangs fall.</li>
    <li> The package arrived and it looked knotted and ruined. When I finally got the wig to an almost preferred style, I tried it on and it didn&#x27;t fit! It won&#x27;t even fit my 8 year old niece, I guess that&#x27;s why they&#x27;re so cheap. I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews prior to me purchasing this wig.  So i got what I paid for if you will. Great for halloween party for children/family.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for a cousin that wanted to know how she would look with bangs in long black hair.  This did the job and will be used for fun.  It is a bit shinny but with a bit of powder it may look more natural.</li>
    <li> This wig was awesome.This wig was well made and very full. Minimal shedding which I can&#x27;t say for other wigs i purchased from Amazon. I will be ordering from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> shed Shed Shed......it tanlgles....but I love the bangs there HOT... I always pin the back up and rock the bangs its still cute. Just cant where it down.</li>
    <li> If you were looking for a wig that looked exactly like the one on the picture, you will be disappointed. This wig is not worth it. After wearing it the first time, the hair tangled so much that I had to chop the bottom part of the wig off to control the mess. Not only does it tangle really easily, it also sheds like crazy, this is no joke the shedding is beyond explanation, at this speed there won&#x27;t be any hair left and the wig is already thin to begin with. It looks nothing like on the picture, it&#x27;s super thin and the fringe looks nothing like on the picture. I&#x27;m beginning to think that the model&#x27;s wig on the picture is her real hair and that the wig is a very bad imitation of her real hair. Save your money, don&#x27;t bother.</li>
    <li> This wig is pretty long, and the package got here a lot earlier than I had though it would which was nice. Although the wig was tangled, the packaging was very nice, and the seller was very pleasant as well. Given, the wig certainly does look like a wig, but with the given price, that is to be expected. Over all I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Love it! so soft! look real! came so fast too :]</li>
    <li> Good product. Looks like pic, easy to comb, and good price!&lt;br /&gt;I liked it very much, and would def wear for cosplay and other fun events :D&lt;br /&gt;Oh and very silky.</li>
    <li> I guess I shouldn&#x27;t have expected much but sheesh this was a horrible cheap wig and lasted only 2 or 3 wears before it was tangled and useless. Don&#x27;t buy</li>
    <li> I bought this wig for Halloween. It was perfect the first day I wore it, but soon after, it kept shedding. Like, nearly handfuls of it. Also, it knots terribly. I can&#x27;t finger untangle it at all, or even use a wig brush. On top of that, it&#x27;s not natural looking. It makes me looks like I put 10 pounds of hairspray to get it as shiny as it is.</li>
    <li> I bought this wig after reading the reviews and decided that it was only $10.99, so I might as well go for it. With that being said here are some of my comments with the wig:&lt;br /&gt;1. I ordered a brown wig and received black&lt;br /&gt;2. The hair was really really really long, maybe 30 inches so I ended cutting quite a bit off.&lt;br /&gt;3. It did have curls, but I would not categorize it as &amp;#34;curly&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;4. The Bangs are great, full and appropriate length,&lt;br /&gt;5. The hair on the wig itself is really thin, so be prepared to backcomb and teeze.&lt;br /&gt;6. It is synthetic so it looks fake.&lt;br /&gt;7. The cap is big with adjustable straps&lt;br /&gt;I ended up cutting about 10inches off and pulling it into a ponytail, it was cute but it was not fooling anyone. I am satisfied with the product for the price. It is makes any difference to you I am an African-American female with natural hair.</li>
    <li> I receive this wig the material its horrible it tangles with in 10 minutes. I will stick to my Outre wigs</li>
    <li> I absolutely /adore/ this wig! I asked for it for a Christmas gift so I could use it for cosplay (Jade from Homestuck specifically) and it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted. It&#x27;s long, it&#x27;s curly, and easy to comb out. I&#x27;ve been wearing it all day and it&#x27;s still perfect and nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A problem could be having to adjust the bangs as they&#x27;re not super even, but they do pass as very pretty bangs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s soft, easy to comb and style, and a very, very nice fit!</li>
    <li> CAP IS TOO SMALL IT SHEDS LIKE A CAT IT LOOKS NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE I HAVE A REVIEW FOR IT ON YOUTUBE UNDER COOL2DAY WIG OR TYPE IN ROKINDATTHANG ITS ONE OF THE TWO VIDS NEVER BUYING FROM THEM AGAIN NOOOOOOOO</li>
    <li> would buy a second one once my old one is done for. I bought it for a costume party but kept it for when I just wanna look cute. great price came on time.</li>
    <li> The wig is made out of high quality material, looks almost like real hair. I would recommend buying this item.</li>
    <li> When I ordered this product I was in a pinch for time to find a wig for an event. The shipping was super quick and I received it within 3 days. Amazing! When I tried it on it looked great at first, but in a few minutes it tangled up a lot and there was a lot of strands falling out. There was hair over the floor. I have to be very careful with this wig and I don&#x27;t expect to get too many uses out of it, but for the price and for what I needed it for it was a good purchase.</li>
    <li> I received this today in the mail and i could not be happier with how soft it was and the bangs were perfect. I was kind of nervous about getting this wig when I read other reviews but I got it anyway and I am more then happy. If you want a wig thats silky and soft with nice bangs, you should buy this wig.. Even though it took a couple of week to get here. It actually came a week before its expected date that was stated online, but this wig is soooo beautiful, it was worth the wait..</li>
