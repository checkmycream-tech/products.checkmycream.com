<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Wonderful product!  I receive it promptly and the cream works.</li>
    <li> Love the retinol, 2% , well I had no problem with sensitivity. I love the whole packaging, very high end and the product seems to do what it says. and no high end brand names to be bought,what&#x27;s not to love about supporting a small business and getting a great American product?</li>
    <li> This is the best face cream!!!  One of my relatives who is a physician recommended it to me. Everyone wants to know what I use on my face and I have had so many people buy this after I told them about it. I really look good for my age and I owe it to this skin cream.</li>
    <li> This cream is great! Doesn&#x27;t burn, it&#x27;s very gentle and I have sensitive skin. It does take a few weeks to see results, but the results are amazing! No more little acne breakouts. It has gotten rid of my old acne scars. And the small lines that had started appearing near my eyes are gone. I strongly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I only rated as a three star due to packaging. I love the actual prodcut. I use it on my face, scars, back of my legs, etc.  The problem is that the container doesnt allow you to see what is left and what you have used.  I end up running out without warning.  I wish they would put it in a tube or a simpler container form.  Hope they read reviews. They should also offer a bigger size.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice texture to apply.  The packaging is VERY nice; it keeps the contents airtight.  I don&#x27;t see much change in the age spots.  The overall appearance of my skin is smoother.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a month and still using  on my face and would say this is a mild cream. I haven&#x27;t seen any redness, irritations or any harsh reactions on my skin.  Probably, as it is retinol, I should give this product a longer time to use on skin to see its renewal</li>
    <li> My wife loves it; swears there is none better . . .</li>
    <li> I really like this cream, it also feels good on my face.</li>
    <li> Im 63 and this product helped give me a baby face.</li>
    <li> this is a a great product for me I really like the results. that is all  i have to say</li>
    <li> I am not one to write reviews, but cream really made a difference with my skin. I am a 27 years old, some say a bit young to be using Retinol cream, but I read somewhere that it doesn&#x27;t hurt to start using it in your late 20&#x27;s. I have always been pron to break outs and with combination skin I was nervous to try this product. The first week or so I did have an increase in breakout, but after about a month of continued use my skin has become more smooth, softer, and the break outs are gone. I would highly recommend this product to any women who have moderate to light acne. Plus what better way to fight the wrinkles then by starting treatment before they emerge.</li>
    <li> used this for over a month, fine lines still there. it wasn&#x27;t until I tried a vitamin E serum that my fine lines started to go. this stuff didn&#x27;t work at all. it did make my face dry and irritated though and fixed big pores issue. wrinkles tho man stayed.</li>
    <li> but I honestly am not sure what if anything it does to diminish my wrinkles. it is however a great product to wear under your make up , however as it is a night crème with retinoid and has no sun screen, you must add sunscreen&lt;br /&gt;it did not irritate my eyes, which that is a BIG plus and has an amazing texture&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con is that you have no clue when to re order , as nice as the dispenser is this makes it less effective&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pro it has no smell, great for sensitive areas like your eyes, great under make up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall though I am not sure as after 6 weeks I saw no improvement in my wrinkles even diminishing , it is quite pricey.</li>
    <li> I am in my mid 40&#x27;s. This product feels great and my skin condition is improved. I developed some acne before I started alternating using it with Glyderm Face Lotion Lite every other night. Great product...I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased many face and eye creams but this has exceeded my expectations. I&#x27;ll soon be 56 and I have only used this for a week but I have noticed diminishing smile lines on my cheeks. What has really impressed me is the fine lines and crepiness under my eyes is gone. My eyes look younger and it doen&#x27;t burn or irritate. I will want to have this great product at all times. Thanks Babyface!</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference after the second night of using this cream.  I am an older woman and wanted a heavier night cream.  This cream didn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thrilled that I have found a night cream.</li>
    <li> good product and low cost</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product every night for about a month now.  It goes on smooth, absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.  My skin feels extra soft and I think it&#x27;s even helped with fine lines!!!  I am definitely going to continue to use this night cream!</li>
    <li> Great product, so happy I bought this..</li>
    <li> Th 2% claim is misleading when you look at amount per. It&#x27;s a decent cream but if you are wanting the true effects of Retinol, you may want to try something stronger and do your comparisons.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really see the difference from any other cream. The way the container dispenses the cream, I have no idea how much is left.</li>
    <li> Good product like the strength without paying the price of the big cosmetic companies.  I have so far seen a change in my skin texture for the better.  Do follow instructions: use only at night, follow up in the morning with sun protection after washing your face. When you use this product always use sun protection in the day. That means EVERYDAY!</li>
    <li> Use sunscreen during the day and use this at night.  It will protect and rejuvenate your skin.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a nice night cream that wouldn&#x27;t break me out. So far so good. It has no smell because i&#x27;m very particular about how anything smells before I put it on my face. Anything to perfumey..I can&#x27;t take a chance of it causing acne. I&#x27;m 45 so I&#x27;ve had a lot of experience with unruly skin. Baby face is fast absorbing. Smooth...And i do more than just one pump because it feels really good going on. I like the fact i can use it  around my eyes..eliminates the use for an eye cream. I&#x27;ll buy it again...price is better than most I&#x27;ve bought at Shopper Drug Mart (Canadian Drug Store). :) I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> I am not sure that it is worth the price. A more inexpensive product may work as good as this one does.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my mom through my amazon account. I have no interest in this product. That being said, my mother said she thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone interested in it.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t help with acne or wrinkles and not the bottle shown in pic</li>
    <li> Product is nice for a night cream. However, as far as exfoliating, it does not. I read a lot of reviews about this product before I purchased it. The reviews were mostly positive except for those who did not like the peeling that is supposed to take place when using a retinol. That sold me even more! I want the peeling... It is the whole purpose of a retinoid cream. I did not peel. I started slow as suggested. Only using the cream every third night. I did this with three applications, with no peeling. So I bumped it up to every night for 4 nights in a row and still... No peeling! I put it on a clean face as instructed. I didn&#x27;t use anything else with it. I don&#x27;t get it. Maybe other people are sensitive to the type of retinol used in this. In my opinion it must be the mildest form. I usually have semi sensitive skin. So I am surprised that after using it four nights in a row that it didn&#x27;t exfoliate at all.&lt;br /&gt;However I will say that I also used it on my neck which is a super sensitive area on me and all I see is red splotchiness. Not peeling but more like an allergic reaction. I must say that my face does feels hydrated. In conclusion: doesn&#x27;t exfoliate, does hydrate, nice moisturizer. There are three types of retinol: I wonder that the retinol contained in this product is the mild type of retin A. Probably won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> This worked really well at giving my face a cleaner look but it disappeared so fast! I don&#x27;t think that its affordable for me so will not order again.</li>
    <li> I have used prescription retinol products and this works just as good.  I like that it is not so strong that I get irritated. Previously I would get red around my high cheekbones after being in the sun. this has enough moisturizer that it works great and my face does not feel starved of moisture while still getting the benefits of a retinoid.  I have use it for a few weeks and my skin is fresher looking.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 47 and was a baby oil and tanning bed user for years back in the 80&#x27;s so there&#x27;s no doubt I have damaged my skin. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year off and on.  Off, only because I run out and then get too busy to re-order. After about 2 weeks I started noticing a difference. Unlike some other posters who have tried prescription Retin-A, I never had. To be honest, the thought of peeling skin wasn&#x27;t appealing to me. I have never experienced peeling with this product but I have noticed a huge difference in the texture of my skin (pore size) and dark spots.  There might be some improvement in the lines at the outside corners of my eyes, but those are still there. About week two I starting noticing my dark spots getting darker. At first this worried me, but then I realized that the top dead layers of skin were coming off and as the sun damage got closer to the surface, they got darker. After another week or so, they were gone.  I make sure to use a SPF30 for my face during the day, but I use this product only at night before bed.  I haven&#x27;t noticed by pillow cases get bleached which is also nice.  I get compliments on my skin almost every day.  I really wish Babyface would make a larger size that could be used on my whole body!</li>
    <li> Ladies, this a great cream.  I am R&amp;D chemist and develop of products. This product is awesome, it works really to even out the tone of you skin too,</li>
    <li> Two weeks of usage, no rash, even I had a sensitive skin. Smooth on your skin.  LIKE A SAID IS NOT MAGIC, still waiting to disappear some dark spots around my eye area.</li>
    <li> As someone who has constantly suffered from acne I was doubtful this would be a great moisturizer. Boy, was I proven wrong! With my first use I could feel the cream working its magic. My skin looks good now and I&#x27;m grateful for it.</li>
    <li> It was ok but I&#x27;m trying other ones.</li>
    <li> I thought a product called &amp;#34;Babyface&amp;#34; would give me nice soft healthy skin. Instead I ended up with un-happy, dry and older looking skin. I went back to my old product. Grassroots Triple Mushroom Intensive Anti Wrinkle Cream. As soon as I went back to my old cream my face started to look young again. I will not by this product again, Babyface didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I was using a much more expensive Retina A product from a boutique supplier. I switched to Babyface Night Renewal and have seen the same results as that fancy product that cost 3x as much. I&#x27;m impressed and will continue to purchase this product. It has decreased my adult acne to almost nothing!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have a bad reaction but I found something with less ingredients that is a little cheaper. It&#x27;s called Botanic Choice Spa Retinol Gel.&lt;br /&gt;It was 8.90 with free shipping.</li>
    <li> When I use it, my skin looks radiant, my pores seem to shrink up and the texture of my skin is significantly smoother. Don&#x27;t use a lot at a time, very little goes a long way. I have 35 year old skin, not bad for my age, but have been distressed by my ever fading glow, growing pores and patchy rough texture. I was so happy with the results that I sent one to my sister. However, the awesome effects don&#x27;t seem to be ever lasting, when I don&#x27;t use it, my skin starts to go back to it&#x27;s old self in a day or two. I have not used the product continuously for long periods of time. I often do a 1-3 days on 1-3 days off or bast results every other day on/ off. it&#x27;s pricey for my blood, but well worth the money. So I try to space it out a little longer. I will definitely keep this one. I looked up the ingredients and tried to find a cheaper ones, I did find another product that was similar, but the texture was way off and the results though good were like playing in different ballparks.</li>
    <li> On my second jar of this cream.  Prevents my breakouts.  My skin texture has improved with this cream as well.  I just wish there was a way for me to tell I&#x27;m almost out before the last pump.  At least with prime shipping I only run out for a couple of days.</li>
    <li> I bought this product as I read it can be good for acne.  I have never had more acne in my life after using this product for a week!  Not sure if it works on wrinkles, but not good for acne.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Tried a few things and this is the cream I will continue to use.  I see improvements in my skin--wrinkles and general health.  And I&#x27;m not dousing myself in toxins when I use it.</li>
    <li> I have used the product 4 days and can see a difference in the fine wrinkles.  My skin is more radiant.</li>
    <li> Loved it. Would buy it again and will recommend it to friends and family. The product helps those fine lines disappear.</li>
    <li> This cream is great! I have gone through two jars so far. It has great ingredients and you can see it working in just a short time. It does not irritate your skin, it is very gentle but effective. The retinol is gentle but works.  I love this product and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I am 33 and just started using this product in the past week.  I have what my husband calls a &#x27;piss wrinkle&#x27;. It is the wrinkle that is located on my forehead between my brows and only comes out when I am pissy! Needless to say, I have never tried a Retinol creme and after reading the reviews I ordered it.  I have been so skeptical on buying things for wrinkles but after the first use I can definitely tell my &#x27;piss wrinkle&#x27; is starting to fade.  I am truly amazed to see the results after the recommended 12 weeks if I am seeing progress after the first few days.  I use the Eminence product line as well and feel like my skin in my 30s will be so much better looking than in my 20s! (how sad!)</li>
    <li> this is my second jar now, and will reorder this. Can&#x27;t beat the price, and I have noticed a difference in my skin. Discolorations are clearing up, and my pores look smaller. Also put it on the back of my hands, and the sunspots do lighten there too.</li>
    <li> This cream is very smooth and works well. It&#x27;s not too heavy on my skin and it also doesn&#x27;t dry up my skin, like most retinol products would. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the smell but it&#x27;s certainly tolerable. I&#x27;ve found that this a good, low-strength product to use in rotation with Retin A to get good results and a solid routine going. It&#x27;s almost impossible to use Retin A every day at first and this would be an excellent substitute.</li>
    <li> I have already finished one jar and have reordered. Great cream. My skin is softer, more even and dark spots are reduced. Not sure about the wrinkles yet, but then again I look in the mirror everyday, so changes may not be so noticeable to me.</li>
    <li> The product was good but i did not like the pot, i feel there would have been a lot more content i could not get to</li>
    <li> I agree with others that have given this cream great reviews.  What a difference in how my skin looks and feels!!!</li>
    <li> I had never used a retinol treatment before so I was looking for a mild product to start off with. I&#x27;m only 25 but already have fine lines on my forehead and nasolabial folds as well as dark spots. I used this cream everyday until I finished the treatment and was disappointed with the poor results.  I figured I would wait to give it a review until I tried another retinol product so that I could make a comparison. I started using AffirmX2 couple weeks ago and already noticed a considerable improvement in my skin. Fine lines are less noticeable, tone is more even, spots are fading and texture is smoother.  Either Babyface has no retinol or their formula is very weak. There is no way I could used Affirm every day, is not aggresive but it peels my skin slightly so  I have to wait at least a week between use.  It is an ok moisturizer but I do not recommend if you are looking for the real thing.</li>
    <li> I get asked constantly about what I use on my face.  This product is wonderful and I swear by it now!</li>
    <li> I would have given this 5 stars but I need to use it longer before I can do that. I really like the container it comes in too.  I use it every night all over my face and neck and so far it is way better than any creams I used before that I spent 100&#x27;s of dollars on. I will definitly be buying Babyface again once this one is gone. I wake up and my skin is super soft and smooth looking. I had a dry patch forever that would not go away with anything I used and it is now gone so I&#x27;m really happy about that. Great product, great price so far I&#x27;m super happy.</li>
    <li> Would have liked to try this product.  Never heard of this company but wanted to give it a try since the Eternity peel pads couldn&#x27;t be delivered for some reason.</li>
    <li> I just purchased this item it came quickly but as far as how well it works I won&#x27;t know for several weeks</li>
    <li> I can see and feel the difference on my face and neck. I will definitely purchase this product again very good result.</li>
    <li> bought this item to help with discoloration and acne scars, but haven&#x27;t really seen any changes.  probably won&#x27;t try this product again.</li>
    <li> Does what it is supposed to. I am seriously loving me some babyface! I will reorder again and again. Shipped on time.</li>
    <li> For my older, or should I say, mature skin this product is fabulous !  I will continue to use since my results lie about my true age of 60 plus. I also bought the eye cream and serum and recommend them also.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using retinol creams for ten years. This product is moderately priced and helps with fine lines and brown spot fading on my face. No prescription required!</li>
    <li> I used this to help resurface my skin on my stomach where I had very bad stretch marks along with there mask and tightening cream now you can&#x27;t see my stretch marks it&#x27;s only been a month I will continue to buy from babyface.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s helping with wrinkles, even after finishing the jar. I do like how it goes on my face and it has a nice neutral smell. Not sure if I&#x27;ll buy again... always in search of that perfect product that helps us 40-somethings.</li>
    <li> After extensive research on retinol products, that could be used on sensitive skin, I chose this one. I&#x27;m dealing with hyper-pigmentation, acne-prone, menopausal skin, and I&#x27;m also African-American. There are so many retinol products on the market, it is confusing, trying to find one, that will work for your particular skin type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works, for me. It is not oily, greasy or makes my skin break out. I am starting to see visible lightening of my dark spots. However, it works gradually, so do not expect miracle results in one day. And, this product may not work for you, because everyone&#x27;s skin is different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy this product again? Maybe, if I can not find another product, that would give me the same results.</li>
    <li> This cream has a nice feel going on and leaves face feeling smoothe. It did not see any significant difference in the tone or fine lines on my skin. I gave it three stars because it is too pricey for the results. I get better results with Olay products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for 1 week. My skin is a bit dry, so I use this as a daily moisturizer, on top of a 20% vitamin C serum.&lt;br /&gt;Did not see any peeling. The skin absorbs it very well and it feels very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the dispenser though. It works well but you cannot see how much is inside.&lt;br /&gt;At least, the jar could be transparent!</li>
    <li> Goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel.  My skin looks better and I haven&#x27;t had as many breakouts.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> I got this product as a gift for my mom. She spends so much at the dermatologist office for this so I wanted to be helpful. After reading all the reviews, I ordered. I gave it to her the other day when I was passing by from work. She called me yesterday and said she likes the packaging allot. It has a push-down thing that enables her to only take what she&#x27;s using without exposing the rest to air. She also said she likes the texture and that it disappears nicely into her skin. I will update again after she&#x27;s used it for at least a month.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this! Especially if you have oily skin, this is the most awesome cream I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t really rate it high haven&#x27;t used it long enough yet</li>
    <li> I was looking for a potent retinol over the counter cream and was ready to order until I noticed the heavy oils and creams in it.  I&#x27;m a licensed beauty professinol and have to say the cream looks great unless you have problematic skin.  Jojoba oil and shea butter have definitely been too heavy for my face in the past.  Hope I find something lighter with the same retinol percentage!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really say anything awful about this face cream because it did make my skin feel soft. But I saw no reduction in my fine lines around my eyes nor on my forehead. So yet again I&#x27;m going to try something else.If you just want your face to be soft this will be perfect for you.</li>
    <li> This product feels good on the face and does produce a light exfoliation. I use it to her three times per week and it does produce a light flakiness the next day. In general I prefer the micro dermabrasion cream to exfoliate some not sure if I would order this product again.</li>
    <li> The jar was broken already when I opened it, and the amount of cream was a joke if not enough for one months , the cream feels good but if that has retinal I am from Japan, no irritation , not sensation or nothing. Not good quality</li>
    <li> I love this product .</li>
    <li> Here is what I found out,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;The anti-ageing industry has been thrown into turmoil after advertising watchdogs rejected claims made for face creams containing the &#x27;wonder ingredient&#x27; retinol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Claims that this ingredient could turn back the clock by removing fine lines do not stand up to scrutiny, according to the Advertising Standards Authority.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what many women don&#x27;t realise is that retinol is another name for vitamin A. This is just one of a number of vitamins and oils found in the foods we eat that can protect against ageing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So with the jury out on certain wrinkle creams, we look at ten alternative ways to keep your skin looking young.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can read more about it here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this cream.  I have only been using it for a couple of weeks so I haven&#x27;t really noticed any results yet.  It&#x27;s a nice cream and makes my face feel smooth at first.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any other results yet like smoother wrinkles.  My fingers are crossed though :)</li>
    <li> I use this product as a night cream, also use in the morning under my makeup.  Of course I let I let my skin absorb product before applying makeup.</li>
    <li> Excellent product when used as directed</li>
    <li> Very nice indeed.  Has not hurt my sensitive skin one bit and is slowly working as they said it would.  Plan to keep on buying</li>
    <li> The item says its 2% and well i have been using if for a week and not seeing anything. I have 1% rentinol cream and it makes my skin peel in 3 days. So not sure whats up with the product.</li>
    <li> This product works really well. It smoothed out my skin and didn&#x27;t irritate it. The smell is fine and the dispenser is great because it protects the product and is more sanitary than a tub where you repeatedly put dirty hands in. The less bacteria on your skin the better. This also helped my blackheads and pimples. Used as a routine should help maintain a nice glowy face.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I took a chance. I have combination skin and it does leave a bit greasy but I can tolerate it. I use it at night and day with sunscreen. I feel that it works magically with make up making my face poreless and flawless just like a primer. No smell, non irritating, easy to use. I have been using for about 4 months and i can see a difference especially when i wake up with it. This is one of my favorite skin cream.</li>
    <li> One of the very few facial products that does exactly what it says. I&#x27;ve tried really high end night renewal creams and this is far better. I can really, really see and feel a difference after a few short weeks. I&#x27;m so glad I found it. I even gave away the high end night renewal cream to my sister and went back to this product.</li>
    <li> Nice but so far no results</li>
    <li> It did not make any difference to my skin.  It serves as a good daily moisturizer, if you do not already use one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the acne claims...I think you&#x27;d be better off using salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide topical creams.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product. I use it religiously and will repurchase.</li>
    <li> This is a good product, good value. I am a skincare junkie and have tried many brands. SkinCeuticals line is my favorite overall but pricey; I have found Babyface has some excellent products for the money. I love the way it makes my face feel. The only annoyance is the jar design which makes it difficult to get all the product out so the jar goes fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I will order again. In fact, I logged on to Amazon to re-order this and supplements to help my concentration but got distracted.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for 2 months now, although  it takes 3 months to see maxium results.  I have some acne scarring and lines on forehead ,and thought I would try it since it is suppose to promote collagen.  So far I notice their is no irritation after applying cream at night time. And there is no peeling like Retin A usually does, I thought the peeling is a good sign of renewal of skin.  I make sure I use a 30 SPF on face in daytime and before applying makeup. I got this cream to see if it would improve acne scarring and lines on forehead. And so far I notice a little improvement in my skin being that it is more smooth. Although I notice the lines and scarring are still there they are smoother in appearance so skin looks better than before.  So overall maybe it will improve more once I use longer for the recommended 3 months.  I will continue to use and will update further results after a full 3 months of use.  And may I add when using this cream only use a pea size to apply on face. And I had put on face in daytime and will never do that again, my face was burning and itching and turned red.  But use only at night and no problem what so ever.</li>
    <li> Once I turned 40 and my skin  loosened around the jaw, w/some dark spots, laugh lines, and uneven tone. I started using this cream along with Arbonne RE9 anti aging products (smoothing facial cleanser, and night repair cr&amp;egrave;me) and the result is much more even tone, less breakouts, and slightly tighter skin. It definitely works because I recently ran out and tried just using the Arbonne products and after 1 week my skin is back to looking more saggy and my &amp;#34;lines&amp;#34; are much more prominent. Anxiously awaiting my order of this new bottle!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m trying this out.  My daughter uses it and recommended it to me.  Time will tell.</li>
    <li> i dont think it really did anything</li>
    <li> The product arrived way before scheduled date.  It goes on smooth without being greasy and absorbs quickly into skin.  My skin along with exfoliating looks shinier, smoother. It doesnt sting or irritate.  I will definitely buy this product again or other products from the seller. Im very happy with my purchase. A product that delivers.  I do wear sunscreen over it to protect my skin. That way you won&#x27;t undue the good the product has done on your skin.</li>
    <li> The packaging looks nice but the application is not a good idea.  The top needs to be pressed down to get product - after 24 hours the product is firm approximately 1/4 inch into the jar.  I do not notice any difference after using this on my face for 4 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;53 years old - female</li>
    <li> used it last night...woke this morning with my face burning, itchy and red, my skin is dried out to the point it looks and feels like leather. Its now 3pm and my face still hurts.It stings like it was burned. I do have sensetive skin, but no product has ever done this to my face! Maybe its too strong...you may try mixing it with a moisturizer. I&#x27;m to scared to use it ever again.</li>
    <li> Non-greasy, and has really made a difference in the appearance of my facial skin! I like this skin care line alot.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this four stars right now till I see how much this product works on my skin.  I mainly got this for rejuvenation. This is the only OTC product that I&#x27;ve seen active peeling with. I am very happy because this means that the retinol is working...if you don&#x27;t see peeling it could be working too for you .... but this has let me visually see it working. I&#x27;ve seen very light peeling on my chest. I will rate this again after I&#x27;ve used it longer and see how much it improves my skin. Happy so far.</li>
    <li> WANTED TO FIND A HIGH DOSAGE RETINOL CREAM OVER THE COUNTER WITHOUT GOING TO DERMATOLIGIST THIS MAKES MY SKIN VERY SMOOTH LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I liked this product.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice retinol product. I appreciate the hygienic design of the pump top.</li>
    <li> I have loved all my Babyface products.  This night cream is wonderful.  I particularly like the way it is packaged..delivering a measured amount and keeping the rest of the cream from air contact.  I have noticed a big difference in my skin since starting this night cream.  I ordered it for its retinol content to remove top skin layer from summer in the sun, and it has effectively done that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my early 20s and due to lots of stress and bad diet my skin looked...old, with lines around my eyes and forehead wrinkles. Clearly just a daily moisturizer wasn&#x27;t doing enough so I started looking for a Retinol cream without parabens or fragrance(I did my research). I have been using this product one month now and it has worked very well. The wrinkles on my forehead are almost gone, the lines around my eyes are nearly gone, and I have soft, healthy-looking skin in the morning. I&#x27;m excited to see the full effects over the next two months. I love this cream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;edit: I used the cream every day for the full 3 months(one container lasted the whole time, and I have more left), the best results happened in the first month. I wouldn&#x27;t say every tiny line has disappeared entirely, but there is a HUGE improvement. Now I use it in the morning just on my forehead and around my eyes and it smooths out those areas for the rest of the day. I just love this cream.</li>
    <li> I think this is an excellent product, but it did not last a week of use. That makes it expensive since this routine (using Retinol) takes 12 weeks to peel dead skin and replenish your cells. So I&#x27;m more disappointed with the actual cost vs the contents.</li>
    <li> I am almost 30 and my skin was looking dull and I was noticing fine lines here and there. I got this last week and the results are instant and amazing. My skin has NEVER looked better. Not only is my skin glowing peaches and cream, the fine lines seem to have disappeared over night. My skin is moisturized and even. It has taken care of any acne I had including blackheads and whiteheads. I feel like my skin is PERFECT right now. I use bare minerals make-up but have stopped wearing it everyday bc I don&#x27;t need makeup on my face now! I will mention that I also use Desert Essence tea tree oil facial cleanser with sephoras small circular brush every evening, warm water only in the morning. I also use Philosophy Microdelivery Peel once a week (that has really improved my skin too!) Babyface Night Renewal cream is perfect for lines and younger people who still get acne. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Love This product. I have really dry skin on my body and face ,skin health and appearance are a big deal for me especially because I am a flight attendant, and for most of us who still care about how we look on the job,lol this is something that I would highly recommend .Ive&#x27; been flying for 6 years and am only 27, but 6 years is long enough to do a lot of damage to the skin because of the dehydrated cabin atmosphere , lack of sleep and poor dieting on the road/sky. Almost look like a newhire again!! lol Seriously this is something that I&#x27;ll be using for a while , Thanks baby face!</li>
    <li> I hate the container! What happens when the container is empty! You can&#x27;t even get into the container to get the residue that cannot be pumped out. Will not order again!</li>
    <li> No change in hydration.or..diminished wrinkles...not sure when I will learn never to purchase beauty products Online.  I have never been satisfied with the creams/beauty products.</li>
    <li> This cream is amazing.  I&#x27;ve been a sucker my whole life and spent thousands of money I don&#x27;t have on creams to help even out my acne scars and blotchy skin.  Nothing has ever worked except my dermatologist prescription. To top it off, I&#x27;m 34 and have loads of wrinkles and sun damage and age spots.  This cream makes my prescription cream work even better as I use them together.  Sometimes I just use this cream.... and it makes my skin better, smoother, more even toned and more youthful than it has in ages.  I mean not by some crazy amount, but really noticeable to the point that even my boyfriend said he can tell that my skin looks much better so thats saying something from a guy who doesn&#x27;t notice all that much.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been useing babyface now for  a month and my face is soft and dimished wrinkles,  going to keep useing!</li>
    <li> I am just trying out this ovely night cream. And how handy it is to be able to order this product online.</li>
    <li> I knew the risk before buying, but being a middle aged woman I&#x27;m willing to try.  In the end, after using the entire jug, there is no change to my skin.</li>
    <li> This product performs as described and I love how soft my skin feels.  It also seems to be reducing spots and evening out skin tone, with no irritation.  I have sensitive skin and cautious about trying new products.  Will purchase this again and will be checking out the other products in the Baby Face line.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen the dramatic results I expected for something with 2% Retinal cream. It&#x27;s a good moisturizer though. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for the price or for corrective use.</li>
    <li> Worst waste of money ever. Used it for couple of month now, no change what so ever. Dont buy it.&lt;br /&gt;I will never buy anything from this company again.</li>
    <li> Being licensed in skin I&#x27;m very cautious what products ill try... This product felt nice on skin but I did not notice any changes that this cream claims to correct... Also not much cream is in it.</li>
    <li> I bought this from Babyface, along with a hair care care product. This product was so drying to my skin, and I have used retinol products before. I understand some products work for some and not others, so the most important thing I&#x27;ll tell you is this: This company does not accept returns on products that have been opened. This shocks me, considering that even drug stores will take back opened beauty products if you&#x27;re not satisfied with them. I guess I should have inquired about the return policy before I purchased these products. I wanted to pass this information on to other consumers so you don&#x27;t make the same mistake. My mistake cost me almost $100. If you are willing to take the gamble, go ahead and try it, but 4 out of 4 of their products didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> The first time I put this cream on my face felt so amazing.  However, my face just kept breaking out.  I thought it couldn&#x27;t possibly be my babyface because retinol is suppose to help prevent acne.  But it was :( Perhaps it is because it is a night cream and really thick.  It didn&#x27;t seem to do much to help with my fine lines either, but it does make your face soft and the dispensing system is really nice.  I have stopped using it and changed to another retinol product and no more pimples.  I really wanted to love this but I guess it was just not for me.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see anything to set this apart from any other face cream.....  Have used it daily for over a month now.</li>
    <li> Use this cream for over three weeks see no improvement.&lt;br /&gt;maybe this is not for me waste of time&lt;br /&gt;and money</li>
    <li> after one night of use, my skin felt smoother and softer.  i have been using it for a week now and love the results</li>
    <li> Good moisturizer.  Skin doesn&#x27;t feel oily</li>
    <li> I like this lotion.  I actually use it under my make-up.  I will purchase again</li>
    <li> Great product, prompt service. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I think this is a great cream!  Wonderful purchase for the price. I intend to re order to have more.</li>
    <li> I have used it for a month along with a Retinol 2%.  It makes my face smooth and hydrated next morning.  I like how it makes my face feel.  I will definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Been using three months, don&#x27;t see a difference!</li>
    <li> Love it... Goes on so smooth...... I do see an improvement in skin texture.</li>
    <li> Ordered this from Babyface directly along with some other of their  skin care products.Poor product,  no improvements noticed even after three months of use. Got taken in by the hype. Disappointing.</li>
    <li> This cream didn&#x27;t fulfil my expectations but I also haven&#x27;t used the entire bottle yet. I have to avoid using it under my eyes as it really irritates the skin - peeling, redness, deep lines. So now I completely avoid the eye area. The cream isn&#x27;t too bad so far but I can&#x27;t really critique the product as of this moment. I did break out in some areas but I believe it&#x27;s because the cream may have dried my skin and my skin may have overreacted by producing more oil. I&#x27;ll have to make another post in a month or so to let you know the full results.</li>
    <li> for the miracle to happen....have always used Retin A....will give it some more time......and then review again because I have not used it long enough  to be fair.</li>
    <li> The product has a high percentage of retinol, the best age-defying cream, and the price was excellent.&lt;br /&gt;I like the way the cream applies and the result seem to be good.</li>
    <li> I will recommend this to everyone. It has great clean ingredients, not harsh on the skin and leaves my skin so soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> This cream took some time to get to me.  It smells nice, but Im not sure if its really working yet.  The second lid screws on the exact opposite of normal lids, and sometimes the way they open up, the cream gets all over.  Otherwise I will have to wait to see on the results.</li>
    <li> Love this cream with Retinol-- no burn, no peel and can already see a difference in my poors and lines. I was very pleased with the packaging too. It stays fresh and you don&#x27;t have to dip into the jar, which is a plus. Would recommend this to my friends.</li>
    <li> Worth every penny, I only wish I started using it years ago. Dermatologists want too much for theirs with many other useless chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;Have skin cancer, so must be cautious about what I use.</li>
    <li> Not strong enough first time users would be great!  This is just an awesome product.  It is well built and does exactly what it is supposed to do!  Great buy fast shipper!</li>
    <li> There appears to be a lot of deceptive product labeling out there; it&#x27;s hard to be sure that the product you are buying really contains Retinol and not something similar (various permutations of Vitamin A).  So I tried this product based on representation that is has 2% Retinol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know whether it is the Real Deal, but the product worked very well for me.  I&#x27;m a 56 y-o male, started using the product every morning after shaving.  My skin looks a lot better after about 6-8 weeks:  smoother, generally healthier appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to try a less-expensive Neutragena product with Retinol to see whether there is any difference (there is no Retinol percentage indicated on the Neutragena product, but I&#x27;ve had good luck with the brand in the past and trust that if it says Retinol on the label, then there is at least some real Retinol in the tube).  If the results are not as good I will probably purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, and you can&#x27;t beat it for the price.  Noticed a big difference in my overall skin tone after just a week.  I also have some acne, especially around that time of the month.  This helped out with that as well.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> This cream is amazing and I can already see diminishing lines.  It feels great on the skin and not too heavy.</li>
    <li> A dermatologist friend recommended I try retinoids as a preventative against aging, and to help stop early fine lines that are starting to develop.  I have incredibly sensitive skin, so he suggested starting slowly with an over the counter product and working up to prescription level retinol.  I was really impressed with this stuff.  The airtight container preserves the product and is easy to use.  I had no irritation at all, though I started with every other night and increased to nightly use after two weeks.  It&#x27;s moisturizes nicely, heavy enough for a cold climate but not so much that it clogs pores.  The results?  Improved skin elasticity, improved luminosity, and long term benefits of a retinoid.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s comfortable ,not  like other retinol products . I need use more time for changing my skin (pore). I will keep it！</li>
    <li> I like the product - I also use Renova, but this is much less drying so I use it in combination.  I could not open the top, and I know I did not get to use the last drop!</li>
    <li> This product is very good. Let my face totally beautiful. It is tremendous anti aging. This is my second bottle and i will use for long time.</li>
    <li> I am almost 50 years old. Most people think I am in my thirties. Some think early forties. I have used retinol for years. This product is a stronger version and works great.</li>
    <li> I used this product for 6 weeks, based on recommendations by the company and reviews from 2 magazines. I did see smoother eye lines, and lightened up 2 darkly-scarred areas not on my face, but the dark under-eye circles did not improve. I do recommend as a gentle anti-aging wrinkle product, but not for dark circles</li>
    <li> This is expensive for its size. if you want the actual retin-a you can buy it from [...] for only a few dollars more and it works 8 weeks faster (this says it will take 12 weeks to see a difference).  The packaging was good as far as protecting breakage but when it arrives the bottle is already ready for use when received (there is nothing to actually open). I didn&#x27;t like that because it could have become contaminated while in the process of packing and shipping. The company should at least put a seal over the hole where the product comes out. Also, you should not try to twist off the top, you will break the jar since it does not twist off. The product itself, goes on well; it is not oily or too thick. It takes two full pumps to cover face and neck evenly. my face became itchy a little while after applying the product (but I&#x27;m using something else so it may have been that, I&#x27;ll update you). Since I have just used this recently for the first time, I haven&#x27;t seen a change in the appearance of my skin yet, but I will let you know if/when I do (or any other changes).</li>
    <li> It is a very nice face cream.  I also like the Babyface eye cream.  You will not be disappointed with both products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m hitting an age where I battle blemishes and dry/aging of my very sensitive, fair skin.  I wanted to use a retinol cream for anti-aging purposes, and all other brands were far too harsh.  Admittedly, I broke out into a slight rash when I first started using this, but it faded, and the results were wonderful.  The product also helped clear up my occasional break-outs.</li>
    <li> HAVEN&#x27;T SEEN A DIFFERENCE YET.  I THINK ITS FINE SO FAR  BEEN OVER A MONTH. I WILL NOT TRY THIS PRODUCT AGAINL.&lt;br /&gt;BABYFACE HAS GOOD MINERAL MAKE UP, THAT&#x27;S GOOD STUFF</li>
    <li> Best bang for your buck. Smoother, brighter, velvety skin that needs less foundation with each day. Cream is not greasy, very clever delivery method - no dipping fingers into the jar and breeding bacteria in the rest of the product. Smooths the lines, delivers results fast - I saw a big difference in under a week. No irritation, peeling or stinging. I use this as night cream. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I don’t know if it does better then a less expensive cream, but I thought $26.00 was inexpensive for a night cream with 2% Retinal A.  I have only been using it for a week, and can already see a difference in my skin. Nothing major yet and I am also using the Proactive during the day. I don’t have acne, but I am 55, and  was out in the sun a lot. My wrinkles are not gone, however I am definitely noticing a difference. Oh and it also gives you the amount you need to use, therefore you can&#x27;t over use it …</li>
    <li> Instantly changes quality of skin to the betterment. In a week wrinkles were gone. My complexion is smooth and brighter and starting to become flawless. One best solution for great skin. Definitely would recommend.</li>
    <li> makes facial skin feel nice and soft. don&#x27;t know yet if it reverses any aging of my already aged skin.</li>
    <li> I am 58 and I have been using this product for a year.  I get compliments every day on my skin. It reversed all of my fine lines and age spots. I use it on my face neck and chest in the morning and at night. I am older than my sisters but look years younger now.. Love it!!!!</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t do ANYTHING for me.</li>
    <li> It does not require much cream to cover the face.  I like it so far.  Haven&#x27;t used it that much as yet,.</li>
    <li> I bought this twice and I am going for round three. I love this product so much. I feel like it renews my skin everytime I sleep with it on. It has a clear finish so it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on the skin and it doesn&#x27;t break me out. It has helped with my hyperpigmentation and I can tell there&#x27;s a difference in my skin texture. Thank you Babyface :)</li>
    <li> Baby Face products are by far the best.  I have been buying these now for several years, they have rapid results.  I am a permanent customer.</li>
    <li> At least for me, the results are really visible, fits my skin type 100% though it&#x27;s very sensitive and even very expensive creams are not always as good as I need</li>
    <li> i have used obagi skin products for the past year and half. the cost runs from $150 to $250 for the kit. i ordered this product after reading the reviews and i absolutely love it! in less than a week my face was so soft and smooth. i am a few months shy of 50 and most people think i am 10 to 15 yrs younger. i will use this product for as long as i can get it!</li>
    <li> have not used long enough honest opinion about the product--positive  will let know when I can really give an honest opinion</li>
    <li> I am a 24 y/o woman, and I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and it is just awesome, I am using it for my acne problem that I got since I arrived to America (bout a year and a half), in the first week i saw changes in my skin, it was softer and relaxed, and my breakouts are totally gone, I have one or another tiny one SOMETIMES and it will not last more than to days. I can not wait to see more results, bc I read that you will start to see some changes within 12 weeks, well I did it already. Good luck and your money will worth it.</li>
    <li> I really like this cream.....received as a gift from hubby for Christmas &amp; he done good lol! I&#x27;ve only used this for a few weeks but it has visibly reduced some crows feet &amp; smoothed out some dry patches. I gave it 4 stars because I did break out a little bit the first week but stuck with it &amp; glad I did, no more break outs ! It has a fresh scent, goes on light &amp; absorbs quickly, love it!</li>
    <li> I usually use Aveeno Nightt cream, but I saw this online and decided to try it. The price was inexpensive and I liked the fact that it had 2% Retinol in it. I like the way it makes my skin feel soft and moisturized after using it in the evening. I would recommend this product if you don&#x27;t want to spend big bucks on a product that works quite well. I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes in my skin but it is non-greasy and absorbs well into my skin. I would recommend it as a good night cream.</li>
    <li> This has preserved my youthful look. It&#x27;s hard to find a retinol with more than 1% in it. This delivers 2% and has a pleasant smell that is not overbearing</li>
    <li> It is nice enough, creamy and moisturizes, but doesn&#x27;t last long, and isn&#x27;t anything special.</li>
    <li> I am 59 and I cant expect to have the face of a baby.  However, I like this product very much, I think it delivers and I will keep it handy. A good buy for sure.</li>
    <li> An excellent product which produces a noticeable difference to skin texture. I&#x27;ve been using it for several years.</li>
    <li> i read all the review before i ordered. i have been using for 3 weeks so far and i didnot see any different on my face.</li>
    <li> Great cream. Non irritated goes on nice not greasy. Too soon to see if it&#x27;s working yet.</li>
    <li> This truly is non-irritating for me, and I usually have a real hard time with retinols.&lt;br /&gt;However, I think I would rather get the real Retina-A - to use every other night.&lt;br /&gt;I think it would yield better results than this alone.</li>
    <li> It works for me, I bought it for skin issues, so going organic is not cracked up as they would like you think all the oil caused me a massive break out.  I bought this for damage control and to clear up my break out</li>
    <li> This is a nice feeling moisturizer.  I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> This wonderful creme is what I was looking for and have ordered 3 more....my skin feels very smooth and makes my skin feel and look terrific!!!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see the exfoliation everyone went on about. I would suspect it&#x27;s because my skin is more like hide! I&#x27;ll stick with my exfoliating tools.</li>
    <li> I use this cream both day and night and my skin just drinks it in.  I have been using it for two weeks now and am completely sold on this cream.  I have wasted so much money on all the other creams out there.  I hope Babyface starts a renewal program as I will sign up quickly.  This cream is amazing.  I love the applicator and how you never touch the product with your hands but rather push down and the cream comes up to the surface thus protecting the integrity of the cream.  I wish I had a vat of it...LOL</li>
    <li> This is probably the best cream I have tried [so far]. I have an uneven complexion that also is marred with blackheads. And not just on my face, either. My chest is, or rather, WAS plagued by them. OK, about 4 days into the nightly application I noticed a much smoother texture of the skin on my face. About a week after starting the regimen, my complexion started evening out. About two weeks into the application, my decolletage looks like what it used to look when I was 15, pre-blackheads and all. I often catch myself running my finger along the skin patch between breasts and neck in complete disbelief at how smooth and silky it is. I did read that you need a full 4 months of application to get the full effect. But if what I am seeing now is any indication of what the final effect might be, I am definitely stocking up on more of this miracle cream. Babyface, where have you been all my life?</li>
    <li> I am 48 and my skin is GLOWING with this product. I have only been using it for 2 weeks, but already a noticeable improvement in skin texture,sun spots are starting to fade, and wrinkles less noticeable! My skin is so soft! I use it night and day along with the eye cream that Babyface offers! Also, I am not new to retiniods...this, by far is the best I&#x27;ve personally come across and the price is a deal!&lt;br /&gt;In two short weeks people have noticed my younger looking, glowing skin. This product works slowly they say, I can&#x27;t wait until it reaches is optimal effect! Can&#x27;t say enough! LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m allergic to vitamin A, this product works well and not so sensitized, I see improvement of my skin, it works! I also am using Glycolic 30%, total effect is good. I will use it!</li>
    <li> Nothing has ever been able to make my skin clear. This cream did in just a couple of months. Less wrinkles, along with firmer and softer skin were added bonuses.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I am 60 and had had problems with hydration during the night with numerous other skin creams. I can not only feel the difference in my skin in the morning but I can see it. I have already placed a second order.</li>
    <li> Does not absorb well into the skin but on the positive it did not clog my pores as most creams do causing breakouts.  Also, I don&#x27;t like the way it dispenses, unsanitary and leaves possibility for bacteria growth.</li>
    <li> hated this.  dried out my skin.  is in the bin</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product.  I notice a difference if I do not use it--so I am a frequent reorderer.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin super soft after applying in the evening , not irritating at all</li>
    <li> The cream is good. It rejuvenate my skin and my scared is lighten.</li>
    <li> as it is descripted, great product.  recommended 100%. Shippement was really fast.</li>
    <li> Love the Face Cream..At my age, People always say I look Younger..</li>
    <li> my order originally somehow got lost in the mail, i sent an e-mail to the seller who quickly responded, asked if i would like a refund or to have it re-sent. I was so impressed by the politeness and options, i decided OK, resend it which they did at no cost to me. GREAT CUSTOMER service :) my order arrived within 2 days...and if that wasn&#x27;t enough...I loved this product the first night!!!! as soon as i applied it i could feel how smooth it was and how great it made my skin feel. This is now part of my personal beauty regime. My mother came by and chose to try it herself when she asked how my face was looking better (btw im 30, and do to many changes began to break out, i found what helped but needed something to help me moisturize and revers some of the old blemishes, pores, and scaring) Its working, no i didn&#x27;t get all those results over night, but with time it has definitely improved. not only will i be purchasing this again but many friends and family who have witnessed my results will be picking this up :) i couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> I like the way my skin feels. My skin feels smoother too. I think it is a little pricey though.</li>
    <li> This cream is very mild, I bought it to help with acne and it has not done anything. I would not recommend it for acne, but it may be useful for anti-aging.</li>
    <li> My skin feels smoother, and I&#x27;m noticing some reduction in fine wrinkles. I use it on my neck and chest as well, and notice greater smoothness in these areas.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I was excited to get this cream.&lt;br /&gt;To my great disappointment this cream not only doesn&#x27;t have any effect on my skin (I am 41) but worst it smells so bad I had to hold my breath while applying it.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> the cream is okay but not for my type of skin. I have sensitive skin it dry and irritate my face..</li>
    <li> This retinol treatment is a great deal because it works just as well as others that cost a whole lot more. I decided to try it because I really like the way the previous cream I used made my skin smoother, evened my skin tone, and made my pores look smaller. This one works just as well, if not better. I liked the look of the packaging, which does not generally influence my decision making, but I figured it was a plus. It was delivered very quickly and I saw results almost immediately. My skin is super sensitive so sometimes I can feel just a slight tingle when I put it on at night. But that makes me feel like it&#x27;s working and I have never seen any irritation, only better looking skin. I have not finished the product yet but I do intend to buy it again.</li>
    <li> I thought this might be a bit harsh for my sensitive skin.  I had a bit of redness at first but that passed and I love the results.</li>
    <li> I have been trying out face creams recently and glad I found this. I wash with a glycolic acid wash then spot treat big wrinkles with neutrogena deep wrinkle repair then slather this on all over my face. When I wake up my face feels great! Complexion is evening out! Some nights I put alpha hydroxide cream in the this on top. (not sure you are supposed to mix). Either way, I love this and will buy again and again!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Wonderful deep hydration without feeling &amp;#34;masked&amp;#34; or grease packed!</li>
    <li> Fast service,and packaging.nice product,without perfume smells, for us with allergies.like the 2 per cent retinal, just a little more than most OTC brands without needing an Rx.</li>
    <li> Really expensive and I suspect it&#x27;s comedogenic (clogs pores) because it caused my skin to break out really badly. I&#x27;m using Paula&#x27;s Choice retinol which is unfortunately even more expensive, but doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out.</li>
    <li> Nice product.  Dispenses one dose at a time, so product stays fresh. Shipped and received in record time. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Amazing product!!! Has helped lessen deep scars on face over 6 + months of am and pm use and by following the directions on bottle.  People notice the difference but it does take commitment in using it and time to work.</li>
    <li> I use this nightly and I&#x27;ve liked it. It seems to do the trick in just tightening the appearance of my facial skin. I&#x27;ll stick with this brand forever.</li>
    <li> This products contains pore clogging ingredients. As a result, it wipes out all the acne clearing benefits of retinol. This cream made my face break out very badly. I found a better retinol product. If you have acne or suffer from breakouts, choose a different product. It is important for acne sufferers to choose products that don&#x27;t have pore clogging ingredients.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 48 year old woman with age spots and wrinkles.  Other crèmes are ok for moisture, but for my skin I need a good retinol crème.  This one had the most retinol allowed over the counter.  It&#x27;s no miracle, but I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> After using this product for a week and a half, I already saw a difference - my skin was smoother and softer!</li>
    <li> has not been everything I hoped it would be, but  hope it will start working better in the near future</li>
    <li> I have replaced my OBAGI ZO with many of the BabyFace products after doing much research.  I just could not afford the Obagi any longer.  I chose this product which has twice the Retinol of the Obagi, and I love it.  I was thinking I could just use this for a while and then switch back to Obagi one day...But I&#x27;m sticking with this!  LOVE IT!  The Complete Eye Cream from BabyFace is also a great product!</li>
    <li> Love. Love. Love this night cream.  I have noticed a marked difference in fine lines on my face and the texture has improved significantly in a months period of time. It&#x27;s not drying and leaves my skin feeling smooth. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I was a sucker for the beautiful product dispensing/packaging and jar display. (I admit it. You got me.) And I noticed its on sale at Amazon for 62% off. What a surprise!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a regular moisturizing facial cream for sensitive skin, I would give it 1 out of 5 stars. There are plenty of facial creams out there that do the same for less, even at 62% off. As a facial cream claiming to have the rich benefits of essential retinol, a well deserved zero. I have used this product for the recommended months (4+) with no visual improvements. However, within 2 weeks of using &#x27;Good n Natural&#x27; brand retinol cream, my dark olive tone skin is brighter and more even toned, softer but firm, and clear. Their packaging is not elaborate but the product works for me.</li>
    <li> For a retinol produce, it is actually a precursor, a detail which wasn&#x27;t in the information on line.  The fine print indicates that it takes much longer, 12 weeks to show results.  Moreover, for a product originally for acne, why does it have so much oil?</li>
    <li> Love this cream! Leaves my face not feeling greasy or dry.. It&#x27;s the perfect combination! I also haven&#x27;t had the occasional acne with this and my pores have been more refined.</li>
    <li> If you want this product you might as well go to the grocery store and pick up a container of yogurt and spread it all over your face you would have the same exact results. It horrible and smells just like yogurt. Their customer service is very rude and nasty. Beware!!!!</li>
    <li> I do like this.  Nice and creamy, smooth, and fast absorbing.  I would probably go back and buy this product again.</li>
</ol>
