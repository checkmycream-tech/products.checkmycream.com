      <li>These are the best I&#x27;ve ever used!  </li>
      <li>They work just GREAT!</li>
      <li>Just the best Scissor that I have purchased.</li>
      <li>The pattern/ridges are not in the best location for fingers.  </li>
      <li>but, I&#x27;m happy!</li>
      <li>Great scissors!</li>
      <li>The cut is very good and does not pull hair as it cuts.</li>
      <li>They hold a good edge and give an excellent cut.  </li>
      <li>great shears</li>
      <li>Nothing great.  </li>
      <li>AMAZING!  </li>
      <li>Oh and the case is a nice touch!  </li>
      <li>Arrived in good time.  </li>
      <li>im very glad i got these for her.</li>
      <li>Amazon refunded my money for the shears and sent ups to pick them up, everything went very smooth with my return and refund!</li>

      <li>i do hair professionally  and these cut wonderfully.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love these scissors.</li>
      <li>They may work better for longer hair, but for the price, I could not recommend them.</li>
      <li>I purchased these shears to cut my husband&#x27;s hair after reading the mostly favorable reviews.</li>
      <li>These are designed to be held loosely with the tip of the finger and thumb and have perfect balance when used correctly.  </li>
      <li>They do not compare to the 150-200 dollar pairs of shears but for a back up or a quick replacement they are amazing !!!!!</li>
      <li>also the other wonderful thing is I can line my customer around the edges and get just as neat as the clippers.</li>
      <li>This makes it easy to keep the correct tension.  </li>
      <li>, I really can&#x27;t complain about the shears, they cut like butter, my client&#x27;s cut was very smooth and neat!</li>
      <li>they fit her JUST FINE.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll have to send them to get them sharpened before I feel comfortable ever using them.  </li>
      <li>i hope this reviews helps anyone looking at these but think they are too cheap or</li>
      <li>I did have to remove the thumb insert to fit my thumb, but it was no problem to remove.</li>
      <li>found these to be extremely easy to use and they cut like a hot knife through butter - with no effort at all!</li>
      <li>im glad i went with this vs her normal paul mitchell ones.</li>
      <li>i was looking at higher priced ones but for the price i really couldnt have hoped for any better.</li>
      <li>When I cut I didnt really hear the loud crunching sound and my cut was very precise...</li>
      <li>Worth the price.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love these scissors they cut great on wet and dry hair price is great will buy from this seller again and as a proffesional stylist will recommend to any other proffesionals!</li>
      <li>I have used these scissors only once so far, but they are a very nice pair of scissors.</li>
      <li>First of all the carrying case pictured is not what you get...</li>
      <li>And the &#x27;razor&#x27; edge grabs the hair and makes the cut exactly where you want it.  </li>
      <li>My only problem is understanding who the inserts were made for; the only people they could fit are children, who shouldn&#x27;t be using these shears, anyway!!  </li>
      <li>These shears are very high quality.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been cutting my own and my husband&#x27;s hair for many, many years and gone through several haircutting scissors.  </li>
      <li>These are very well made.  </li>
      <li>They look as good (if not better) as in the photos!  </li>
      <li>The scissors work great though the finger holes are definitely on the small side.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>i would highly recommand these to any hair stylist.</li>
      <li>In fairness, the size is not the products fault, although it would have been very helpful to know that the measurement does not include the pinkie rest as with other available shears on the site.</li>
      <li>I was very sceptical when purchasing these shears, When I recieved them I did not expect them to be used, I could tell the shears were kinda old and used before</li>
      <li>These shears are very sharp and easy to use.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m ready for my next set!</li>
      <li>wife has small fingers and actually prefers to use them with the included inserts, since they provide better grip.</li>
      <li>It makes it kind of difficult when you can only use the tips of your fingers.</li>
      <li>After properly tightening these, I was unable to use my fingers to pry apart the tips, yet they still open and close very smoothly.  </li>

<li> my seem like a lot of money to pay for a pair of scissors, but if you are serious about cutting hair at home for the long term, these are actually a very good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I have been looking for this type scissor for a long time</li>
<li> I will keep these shears for a very long time!</li>
<li> Second, the blades do not seem very sharp at all - I could have gotten a $12 pair of Tweezerman scissors that are sharper,</li>
<li> Worked as well as I expected.</li>
<li> The only downside is that the holes for the fingers are somewhat small.  </li>
<li> The blades are sharp enough but the rounded design moves the hair too much for precision cutting, in my opinion.</li>
<li> The small finger grips take a little getting used to if you&#x27;re used to using regular shears.  </li>
<li> They are very sharp and durable, they cut hair evenly and haven&#x27;t dulled at all.</li>
<li> Oh by the way, watch your fingers, very sharp</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this item.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> i cant really even think of any bad things to say about these shears.</li>
<li> After 4 month they are already dull..  </li>
<li> I wanted to replace my 10-year-old 4.5&amp;#34; ICE shears and feel, in comparison, that these are too big and clunky for cutting men&#x27;s hair.</li>
<li> AT ALL, I WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF CUTTING MY CUSTOMER AND</li>
<li> They cut my husband&#x27;s course, thick hair like paper.  </li>
<li> I should have listened to the negative reviews on this one!!</li>
<li> you get a very thin triangular sheath to slide the scissors into.  </li>
<li> BUT THE SHEARS ARE USELESS, I CANT EVEN CUT PAPER WITH THEM!!!!</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own and my husband&#x27;s hair for many, many years and gone through several haircutting scissors.  These are the best I&#x27;ve ever used!  They cut my husband&#x27;s course, thick hair like paper.  And the &#x27;razor&#x27; edge grabs the hair and makes the cut exactly where you want it.  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I have used these scissors only once so far, but they are a very nice pair of scissors. The cut is very good and does not pull hair as it cuts. I did have to remove the thumb insert to fit my thumb, but it was no problem to remove.</li>
    <li> After 4 month they are already dull..  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this item.&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Arrived in good time.  The pattern/ridges are not in the best location for fingers.  The sharpness is nothing to brag about.  They work - that&#x27;s about it.  Nothing great.  My school scissors work just as well.</li>
    <li> I ordered these for my mom whos been a hair stylist for about 40 years now and she use to use paul mitchell shears/scissors what ever you&#x27;d like to call them and she says this cut smoother even her clients have noticed that theres a big difference they hear/feel the difference they say its alot smoother and a nicer cut. i would highly recommand these to any hair stylist. over all my moms very happy with them im very glad i got these for her. i was looking at higher priced ones but for the price i really couldnt have hoped for any better. im glad i went with this vs her normal paul mitchell ones. i hope this reviews helps anyone looking at these but think they are too cheap or w/e the reason might be. i cant really even think of any bad things to say about these shears. My moms very happy with them.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these scissors they cut great on wet and dry hair price is great will buy from this seller again and as a proffesional stylist will recommend to any other proffesionals!</li>
    <li> cut my husbands hair with these and my bangs...love it.....great shears</li>
    <li> They look as good (if not better) as in the photos!  It&#x27;s nice to have an adjustment nut.  This makes it easy to keep the correct tension.  My only problem is understanding who the inserts were made for; the only people they could fit are children, who shouldn&#x27;t be using these shears, anyway!!  They hold a good edge and give an excellent cut.  Oh and the case is a nice touch!  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great scissors! They are very sharp and durable, they cut hair evenly and haven&#x27;t dulled at all. I absolutely love these scissors.</li>
    <li> These shears are very sharp and easy to use.  The small finger grips take a little getting used to if you&#x27;re used to using regular shears.  These are designed to be held loosely with the tip of the finger and thumb and have perfect balance when used correctly.  The tension screw allows you to adjust the amount of presser it takes to move the handle and I like the short blade length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found these to be extremely easy to use and they cut like a hot knife through butter - with no effort at all!</li>
    <li> The scissors work great though the finger holes are definitely on the small side.  My wife sqys they fit her JUST FINE.</li>

When I cut I didnt really hear the loud crunching sound and my cut was very precise...also the other wonderful thing is I can line my customer around the edges and get just as neat as the clippers. Now I must say the clippers still give a cleaner finish when it comes to tapering.  I&#x27;m impressed and suprised with my results. I will keep these shears for a very long time! I&#x27;m ready for my next set! Oh by the way, watch your fingers, very sharp blades!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE!!!! THIS IS ONE WEEK FOLLOWING MY PURCHASE!!!&lt;br /&gt;ITS BEEN ONE WEEK LATER AND THE SHEARS DONT CUT AT ALL, I WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF CUTTING MY CUSTOMER AND THE SHEARS DID NOT DO ANYTHING BUT FOLD HER HAIR, I DON&#x27;T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED BUT THE SHEARS ARE USELESS, I CANT EVEN CUT PAPER WITH THEM!!!! IM SOOOO DISAPPOINTED!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 8/10/11 Amazon refunded my money for the shears and sent ups to pick them up, everything went very smooth with my return and refund!</li>
    <li> Just the best Scissor that I have purchased. I have been looking for this type scissor for a long time and I did a lot of research before I purchase this pair. I am very happy that I did. I use them to trim my beard. They work just GREAT!</li>
    <li> Worked as well as I expected. Worth the price. Nothing else to say but, I&#x27;m happy! And that is all to me.</li>
    <li> First of all the carrying case pictured is not what you get... you get a very thin triangular sheath to slide the scissors into.  Second, the blades do not seem very sharp at all - I could have gotten a $12 pair of Tweezerman scissors that are sharper, I used to have a pair that were!  Third, the the steel is spotted like it&#x27;s about to rust or pit.  I&#x27;ll have to send them to get them sharpened before I feel comfortable ever using them.  I should have listened to the negative reviews on this one!!</li>
    <li> AMAZING!  i do hair professionally  and these cut wonderfully.  They do not compare to the 150-200 dollar pairs of shears but for a back up or a quick replacement they are amazing !!!!!</li>
