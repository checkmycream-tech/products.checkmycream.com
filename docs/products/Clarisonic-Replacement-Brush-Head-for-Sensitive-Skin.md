<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE the clarisonic. Just purchased the bigger model with handle for cleaning back. It really isn&#x27;t much bigger than the small one.</li>
    <li> Since I started using Clariisonic products my skin feels much better and this brush is just perfect fit for my mixed (oily and dry skin). Recommended.</li>
    <li> This brush fit perfectly on my Clarisonic.  As before, it works great to clear up skin, remove dead skin cells and the brushes and bristles are soft, yet work well.  It did not irritate my sensitive skin.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> For an item that is used on your face I would expect more professional or original packaging.  A brush wrapped in bubble wrap and tissue paper doesn&#x27;t make me warm and fuzzy, especially considering I have sensitive skin (hence my order).  I&#x27;ve written the seller and requested to return the item.</li>
    <li> This replacemnt head works just great! I find the sensitive skin head works better for me than the normal head. If you have sensitive skin or dry skin this is the brush head for you!</li>
    <li> My wife uses the Clarisonic Mia. She needed a new head so I did some comparison shopping and Amazon&#x27;s were the cheapest. Fit right onto the Mia.</li>
    <li> This item is perfect for what I was looking for. Definitely worth the price that I paid for. Great product!</li>
    <li> love my clarisonic machine</li>
    <li> The best gift I could give to all the women I know.  I bought all of them the Clarisonic a few years ago and felt responsible to get replacement brushes.  And had them all delivered separately.</li>
    <li> I would never give up my clarisonic so I have to replace my brushes. I LOVE the sensitive they are perfect for my skin.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement head for my Clarisonic machine.</li>
    <li> love gets my face very clean</li>
    <li> The relacement brush was defective.  Everytime i use it,the brush seperates from the handle.  The great price was because it was defective and would not have been sold in stores.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a Clairsonic brand brush.  I will spend the money and buy the real thing.  It&#x27;s worth it in the long run.</li>
    <li> I did not like this product... I kept using it thinking it would \\&quot;wear\\&quot; down. But it never did. I went back to my original Clarisonic (same) brush and it was not as rough. This was like sand blaster. It was horrible. Rough, like a sand paper over and over on my face! In addition it came in a not protected paper post office package that must have been smooshed in delivery and the case they have protecting the brush was crushed on to it. It took some prying to get the brush off the case.&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy brushes off the internet again. I will go to the retail store from now on!</li>
    <li> I was surprised to see that it was off brand and not a Clarisonic brush. It worked fine at first but the bristles seem to have gotten a little hard. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll purchase off brand brushes again. Think I&#x27;ll stick to the Clarisonic brand.</li>
    <li> Great value!! In fact, the best price I could find during my internet shopping. Easy to attach and detach. Loving my Clarisonic.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed it did not come in a clairsonic box like the ones I have ordered in the past.  It was in a sealed plastic bag, but I wondered if it had been returned or was not an original clarisonic product.  I may be returning this item, just have not decided yet.</li>
    <li> Something was not right with this brush head. It irritated my skin despite it being a sensitive brush head. I&#x27;ll stick with commercial retailers.</li>
    <li> this did not feel like an &amp;#34;authentic&amp;#34; or original clarisonic brush head. it was hard to use and actually hurt my skin. I stopped using immediately.</li>
    <li> I like this a lot better than the brush head that came with my Clarisonic.  I have very sensitive skin, so this one works very well for me.  Super soft.</li>
    <li> I just Love cleansing with my Clarisonic. I prefer using the sensitive brush head. If you are looking for Good facial cleansing products.....I recommend Clarisonic.</li>
    <li> I like that I can purchase a single replacement head for the Clarisonic at discounted price.&lt;br /&gt;Shipped quickly. Would order again.</li>
    <li> The product is just okay but not as sturdy as the original brush head.  Arrived in a timely fashion and well wrapped.</li>
    <li> this is first time that i wrote review of product.  i was always satisfied with products that i ordered at amazon&lt;br /&gt; before i ordered product i read reviews and then placed orders. but this time i didn&#x27;t . because i never expected&lt;br /&gt;there were fake product. OMG! but qulity was terrible.  terrible noise.  it didn&#x27;t work properly  i throw away it after&lt;br /&gt;i used only twice. i think this was fake one.  is it okay to sell fake in US?&lt;br /&gt;if you want to buy it, go to other department store or other not here.</li>
    <li> Difficult fit, hard to install  use cover cap, but remains difficult for me, is this a name brand or cheap immitation??</li>
    <li> All Clarisonic brush heads are good and it&#x27;s nice to have a change of different brushes during the different times of the year</li>
