      <li>but it&#x27;s own special size which we were unable to fit after an entire day of back and forth to lowes.</li>
      <li>I plan to purchase more in the future and switch a few more sinks over.</li>
      <li>The only thing is the piece that holds faucet to the sink on the bottom could be bigger to make it easier to secure the faucet to the sink.</li>
      <li>Works like a charm for three weeks so far.</li>
      <li>As stated in other posts very hard to connect  I am very handy</li>

    <li> This is an European fixture that doesn&#x27;t fit most American (plumbing) standard fixtures. If you purchase this fixture, be prepared to change out your nozzle spray.</li>
    <li> Worked like a charm. Very happy with the purchase.</li>

    <li> I ordered two faucets and after using one of them a few times the tube busted and sprayed water all over my stylist and her client. They did replace it when I called them.</li>
    <li> Found the proper fittings finally and got it finally installed but works great. Check the full discription before you order on all fitting size.</li>
    <li> We needed to change the connections as some users suggested but pretty easily done and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> Bought this shampoo faucet to replace original that had leak from braided hose and connection at head. Works like a charm for three weeks so far.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t not fit our sink. It is neither 3/4 or 7/8 but it&#x27;s own special size which we were unable to fit after an entire day of back and forth to lowes.</li>
    <li> Fits just like the original.  Works perfectly. The only thing is the piece that holds faucet to the sink on the bottom could be bigger to make it easier to secure the faucet to the sink. All in all a great product.</li>

    <li> I am extremely happy with my faucet, I have used the traditional one for my salon and it only lasted 3 months.  This faucet is much easier, I am going to order another one.  The seller sent it immediately, I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I have been in business for the past 30 years in a salon.  I would recommend this opposed to the traditional round handles!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much for making my life at work easier.&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
    <li> Very nice faucet.  I did need to go get parts to hook up. It would be nice if sizes were posted so could have been ready to go when I got the faucet. But is working great.</li>
    <li> After going to 4 hardware stores none of the stores carried anything related to shampoo bowls. Thanks to amazon. It fit perfect for my shampoo bowl. And reasonable price. Very easy to install</li>
    <li> It works great, fit perfect. Is a bit loud when trying for warm water. Not loud at all on cold or hot.</li>
    <li> I should have listened to the other reviews.  The faucet is well constructed but my plumber and I could not find an adapter for the hose connection.  We went to every home improvement store and specialty hardware store only to find a connector that did not match the thread pattern.  The hose connector is very odd and not standard in anyway.  The water connections worked fine.  I had to purchase another faucet.</li>
    <li> Plumbing parts were not size stated and leaked. had to redo all of it.</li>
    <li> Very good for the price</li>
    <li> The Shampoo Faucet fit perfectly and it was easy to install.  The price was great and again it&lt;br /&gt;was delivered quickly.</li>
    <li> Thanks for the great deal and the fast shipping. It was an easy install with no fuss. Top Quality unit!</li>
    <li> The two items do not match each other. The fittings are different.  The fitting on the sprayer does not fit the faucet.  Hardware store does not have the correct fitting to make this match work right.  I have a leak where these two parts fit together.  The correct fitting should have been made into the parts or an adapter should have been included.</li>
    <li> Before you remove the old faucet, MAKE sure you have the right fittings. If you have 3/8&amp;#34; compression fitting shut off vales which most faucets have. you need to buy the following, two 3/8&amp;#34; to 1/2&amp;#34; supply tubes and two 1/2&amp;#34; NPT nipples.</li>
    <li> Fits the shampoo bowl but the hot and cold water host are too short.</li>
    <li> It fit and works welk</li>
    <li> We ended up spending more money to replace different parts to work. It didn&#x27;t fit the shampoo bowl. The part you screw on was to big. But it&#x27;s working perfect now</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with them Lowest price and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Exactly as I expected</li>
    <li> It fits and it was not bad installing this..  To whoever buy shampoo bowl faucets;  Make sure you get a sprayer that has the same measurement as the water outlet.</li>
    <li> As stated in other posts very hard to connect  I am very handy so I decided to buy it . It cost me more for fittings and trips to home depo and the plumbing supply store the supply hose too short  then out line is pipe fitting had to reduce to 3/8 compression</li>
