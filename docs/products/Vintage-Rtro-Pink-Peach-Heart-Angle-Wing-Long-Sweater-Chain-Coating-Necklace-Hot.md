    <li> Beautiful! I love it. I can wear it with my casual clothes or even when I dress up. Two thumbs up for this necklace.</li>
    <li> A good item for the price but smaller than I expected. it&#x27;s Just as pretty as in the picture though</li>
    <li> I really like it but I expected it to be a little bigger. It is beautiful and cute none the less.</li>
    <li> I would have given this items as than 1/2 a star but device is not set to accept such low rating. Word not have been expected such low quality or picture misperception from a 1950+ Cracker Jack box. Pendant smaller than chain. Looks  awarded.</li>
    <li> So Im the kinda girl that likes pink and heart and I wear them like every single day that I can. so this was a perfect fit for me and it was so cute!!!</li>
    <li> I love this necklace! It is just so cute. I love the way it looks and how it fits. It&#x27;s perfect. I can&#x27;t wait to wear it and see what people say.</li>
    <li> Now, I did not read the dimensions before I ordered this so I really have no right to talk but I was thinking it would be much bigger! The picture is pretty deceiving (welcome to online shopping though). However, I would purchase again. It&#x27;s totally adorable and the small size does make it pretty charming.</li>
    <li> This necklace looks cheap. What else would you expect for such a low price? I was a bit dissapointed. The beads looked like they were glued on by a 5 year old.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in this one. It looks really cheap. I realize that it was unexpensive however it was just below standards.</li>
    <li> I thought it was kinda big but it was tiny n the pink bean fell off when I got it but I mean that&#x27;s what u get with the cheap price</li>
    <li> the bronze chain stinks</li>
    <li> The quality is great. The chain is nice and sturdy, and the pendant doesn&#x27;t feel cheap at all. Pendant is a bit smaller than I thought, but the chain is great length. Still cute though. Great price also.</li>
    <li> This is pretty. I wear it with a few longer necklaces since it is right about at the chest line. Looks nice with other similar colored pieces.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit smaller than what it looks like in the picture but it&#x27;s so beautiful still. I bought 2 one for me and one for my best friend and we both love it! It&#x27;s absolutely beautiful!  it&#x27;s very vintage and stunning!</li>
    <li> What can I say, well its simple but cute. I wore it like two times already and people tell me how cute it is. again its kind of simple thought.</li>
    <li> super cute....LOVE it...thank you!!!</li>
    <li> Kinda cheap looking especially the pink plastic beads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AWMBX1Q/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_6&lt;br /&gt;You should buy this mini clock. It was 3 bucks now its 5 but the quality is really good and it has a functional clock and is super cool.</li>
    <li> What I got is not quite the same as the picture but its darn close, I was thinking this would be a bit bigger but that&#x27;s ok as well the beads are closer together than in the picture but once again, that&#x27;s ok.. I cant wait to wear this with some cute shirts :)</li>
