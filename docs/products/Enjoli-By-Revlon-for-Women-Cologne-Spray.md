      <li>I have purchased through this seller before and they continue to provide EXCELLENT service and so long as they do, I will continually buy from them.  </li>
      <li>so I was pleased with how easy and convenient it was.</li>
      <li>Shopping on Amazon was easy and I purchased my favorite perfume for a fraction of the cost I was paying for it.</li>
      <li>so I was extremely excited to be able to purchase this for her on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I appreciate amazon having my cologne available.  </li>
      <li>I would love to find more, I would order as much as I could afford.</li>
      <li>Great perfume but not worth the price at all.</li>
      <li>I HAVE USED THIS SINCE I WAS 16 YEARS OLD; I LOVE THIS COLOGNE,</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s still available because I&#x27;ve been using the same perfume for 20 years.</li>
      <li>It still has the right fragrance...</li>
      <li>I love this perfume, the fragrance is so pretty and soft.  </li>
      <li>And you certainly can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
      <li>exactly what i wanted for my wife.</li>
      <li>I have worn this perfume for over 25 years and when I first tried this bottle it gave me a headache.</li>
      <li>I always order cases of products I find perfect for me because without fail, the manufacturers eventually discontinue them.  </li>
      <li>Thanks so much!</li>
      <li>Very feminine fragrance, not overpowering, like alot of brands on the market today.</li>
      <li>Also it was displayed very well.    </li>

      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s long lasting and fantastic fragrance!!</li>
      <li>The box and the bottles with covers look authentic, but the sprayers are cheaper and the scent is different, harsh, and cheap smelling.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s no longer available, even from other countries.</li>
      <li>Live an learn.</li>
      <li>My wife tried an old gold capped bottle for Christmas.</li>
      <li>Lovely, long lasting fragrance, usually sold in local drug stores at reasonable prices ($19.95 - $25.00).  </li>
      <li>I purchased a few bottles when I found that Enjoli was being discontinued and now that I have opened one, it is obvious that it is a knock-off and not an original.</li>
      <li>i used to by enjoli for only 18 to 20 bucks you guys suck at how much you charge not worth buying from you at all</li>

<li> My mother has worn this perfume for as long as I can remember, I bought her two bottles last April for $8.97 for a 2.5oz bottle.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not a frequent online shopper</li>
<li> Their excuse?  </li>
<li> She&#x27;s worn it for as long as I can remember.</li>
<li> I have used this perfume for many years and it has become impossible to find it in the stores.  </li>
<li> From reading the previous reviews, I was unaware that stores no longer carried this product.  </li>
<li> and I received the product in only a few days.</li>
<li> I cannot find in local stores no more</li>
<li> I then opened the other bottles to find the same cheap sprayer and the same awful scent......</li>
<li> It&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve smelled a fragrance that stinks.</li>
<li> It was also less than what I usually pay in the store</li>
<li> As usual, I will order a couple of cases.  </li>
<li> Thought I was getting 3 bottles for $100...however only received 1....totally too expensive.  </li>
<li> I have been using this product for at least 27 years and will go with nothing else.  </li>
<li> Prices on Amazon are ridiculous, i.e., over $200 for a cologne I used to pay approximately $20 for?  </li>
<li> too late to do anything about it!</li>
<li> THIS PRODUCT IS VERY HARD TO FIND AT ANY RETAIL STORE.</li>
<li> buy it at RIDICULOUS PRICES here or ebay!  </li>
<li> This is a ridiculous situation!  </li>
<li> This same item is now selling for $75 a bottle that is just completely outrageous!  </li>
<li> A lot of the other scents on the market smell like insect repellent to me.</li>
<li> bad</li>
<li> Wife is disappointed.</li>
<li> I was disappointed when it took 5 days to arrive, the day after Mothers Day.</li>
<li> Very disappointed that it took them 9 days to discover that the item was \\&quot;out of stock.\\&quot;  </li>

    <li> my perfume arrived in a very timely way, and was in perfect condition..very good service!</li>
    <li> I gave this perfume as a gift to a co-worker for her birthday two bottles. Cause, she likes all kinds of perfumes and scents.</li>
    <li> The product was as ordered and arrived in good condition, however I thought I was paying for expidited 2 day shipping and as the item was shipped on the tuesday before Mothers Day and as it was a gift for Mothers Day I was disappointed when it took 5 days to arrive, the day after Mothers Day.</li>
    <li> I appreciate amazon having my cologne available.  I cannot find in local stores no more and it is the only  cologne I like.  Thank you  Shirley Lukasik</li>
    <li> i love this perfume!! i love its smell and get a lot of compliments whenever i wear it! i would totally recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have used this perfume for many years and it has become impossible to find it in the stores.  I have purchased through this seller before and they continue to provide EXCELLENT service and so long as they do, I will continually buy from them.  The price is right and the perfume is excellent.  Thanks</li>
    <li> From reading the previous reviews, I was unaware that stores no longer carried this product.  I have been using this product for at least 27 years and will go with nothing else.  As usual, I will order a couple of cases.  I always order cases of products I find perfect for me because without fail, the manufacturers eventually discontinue them.  For example, my lipstick.  At any rate, this is a wonderful cologne and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item when it was $28+ a bottle.  Ordered two for a friend.  Later that afternoon, the price shot up to $70+ a bottle.  My order didn&#x27;t ship.  And then it didn&#x27;t ship.  And then it didn&#x27;t ship again.  Amazon still shows my order getting ready to be shipped, but NetRush cancelled via email this afternoon.    Their excuse?  \\&quot;Out of stock.\\&quot;  Hmmmmmmmmm........  Very disappointed that it took them 9 days to discover that the item was \\&quot;out of stock.\\&quot;  Or is it?  Would be nice if they informed Amazon so I could get this \\&quot;purchase\\&quot; (ha!)off my history.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t find in stores. I was happy with the service and delivery. I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s still available because I&#x27;ve been using the same perfume for 20 years. I love this product!!!!</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find my Mom&#x27;s favorite perfume on Amazon.  I can&#x27;t find Enjoli in stores any more so I was extremely excited to be able to purchase this for her on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Item was purchased as a give, quality product, excellent services, will purchase from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Only cologne I buy!! It&#x27;s long lasting and fantastic fragrance!! Will buy over &amp; over again!!</li>
    <li> I had this in college...always liked it. Very feminine fragrance, not overpowering, like alot of brands on the market today. And you certainly can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> I purchased a few bottles when I found that Enjoli was being discontinued and now that I have opened one, it is obvious that it is a knock-off and not an original. The box and the bottles with covers look authentic, but the sprayers are cheaper and the scent is different, harsh, and cheap smelling. I have worn this perfume for over 25 years and when I first tried this bottle it gave me a headache. I then opened the other bottles to find the same cheap sprayer and the same awful scent......too late to do anything about it! Ripped Off! Don&#x27;t buy!</li>
    <li> exactly what i wanted for my wife. this will make her christmas. ordering was simple and delivery was prompt. thank you. i will purchase from seller again.</li>
    <li> I have been using and enjoying Enjoli for many, many years.  Had I known Revlon was going to discontinue it, I would have stocked up.  Prices on Amazon are ridiculous, i.e., over $200 for a cologne I used to pay approximately $20 for?  At that price I will reluctantly look for another fragrance after my one remaining bottle is gone.  Would love for Revlon to reconsider.  A lot of the other scents on the market smell like insect repellent to me.</li>
    <li> My wife tried an old gold capped bottle for Christmas. It&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve smelled a fragrance that stinks. She&#x27;s worn Enjoli for the 20 years I&#x27;ve known her so I know what it should smell like. Caveat Emptor. Awaiting the sellers response for a return.</li>
    <li> My wife just loves this cologne and used it for years, but this item has disappeared from the stores that use to carry it.  I was very glad to see that I could get it through Amazon.com. The service was just great and also the price. Also it was displayed very well.    Thanx  Amazon.com</li>
    <li> I love this perfume, the fragrance is so pretty and soft.  I had been buying it at my favorite store however they do not carry it any longer so I had to search for it. Shopping on Amazon was easy and I purchased my favorite perfume for a fraction of the cost I was paying for it.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is very nice.  I have used it for years and love it.</li>
    <li> Several of the stores I shop at have quit carrying Enjoli so I had to turn to shopping online for the product. I&#x27;m not a frequent online shopper so I was pleased with how easy and convenient it was. It was also less than what I usually pay in the store and I received the product in only a few days. I will shop here again.</li>
    <li> My mother has worn this perfume for as long as I can remember, I bought her two bottles last April for $8.97 for a 2.5oz bottle.  This same item is now selling for $75 a bottle that is just completely outrageous!  Great perfume but not worth the price at all.</li>
    <li> i used to by enjoli for only 18 to 20 bucks you guys suck at how much you charge not worth buying from you at all</li>
    <li> Love, love, love it!  This is my mom&#x27;s favorite fragrance.  I would love to find more, I would order as much as I could afford.</li>
    <li> Product was as advertised but company does not have a good inventory control.  My order was cancelled by them and credit issued as no stock.  However merchandise was delivered and I had to contact them to re-bill me.</li>
    <li> Wish I could still buy this cologne for my Mom! She&#x27;s worn it for as long as I can remember.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;ENJOLI\\&quot; is a product used by scores of women for many, many years. Lovely, long lasting fragrance, usually sold in local drug stores at reasonable prices ($19.95 - $25.00).  All of a sudden Enjoli has disappeared from all stores and can only  be found on Amazon or Ebay for OUTLANDISH, out of the ball park prices!!!! Why??  What happened? If it&#x27;s been discontinued from Revlon - what happened to all/any bottles that were left over?  NONE in the stores...and for those of us who are ardent fans...we&#x27;re left with ONLY ONE alternative...buy it at RIDICULOUS PRICES here or ebay!  Who profits?  People who have bottles \\&quot;left over\\&quot;?  What&#x27;s Up????  Is this Revoln&#x27;s way of forcing us to buy another product??  This is a ridiculous situation!  SHAME ON YOU REVLON! AND for those of you who do have bottles to sell - $99 + and up is OUTLANDISH! SHAME ON YOU TOO!</li>
    <li> Thought I was getting 3 bottles for $100...however only received 1....totally too expensive.  Live an learn. It still has the right fragrance...Think the product was a left over from the Orient.</li>
    <li> My mother&#x27;s favorite scent; so incredibly pleased to find it online!  Mom was thrilled!  Birthday was salvaged!  Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> Well my wife loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad it&#x27;s no longer available, even from other countries. a discontinued perfume, with no remaining inventory. Wife is disappointed.</li>
    <li> Bought for wifey ... she loves the 80&#x27;s scene :)</li>
    <li> I HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR FOUR YEARS FOR THIS. I HAVE USED THIS SINCE I WAS 16 YEARS OLD; I LOVE THIS COLOGNE,</li>
