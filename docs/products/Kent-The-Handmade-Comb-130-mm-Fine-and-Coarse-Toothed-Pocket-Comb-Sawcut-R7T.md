<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> No seriously best comb ever! Big bearded bear here, I use it several times a day.  In fact, I now have 4!</li>
    <li> I was hoping this would be my go to pocket comb... but.... This comb is... eh. Too fine/short for my coarse/curly beard and too small to restyle my hair properly throughout the day (I use Anchor&#x27;s Teddy Boy Original pomade). My goodness, the teeth are so short! For someone that likes to style med/tall pompadours and have big beards this comb just simply won&#x27;t do. For the beards up to 2 inches and shorter hair styles this is a good comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super smooth and doesn&#x27;t scratch the scalp. I might have to look into the 12T or 7T, or a bigger coarse/fine comb.  I&#x27;m a big guy (about 6&#x27;2&amp;#34;), so I need a comb thats a bit bigger. This seller advertises it as 130mm, it&#x27;s actually 133mm, and Kent advertises it as 143mm. So be sure to do your homework on the sizing. I hope I don&#x27;t have to waste money on the whole line of combs to figure the best one for me, haha.</li>
    <li> My sense of scale failed me, so the comb was a little smaller than I was expecting, but that was my fault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comb itself is great. Looks great and doesn&#x27;t scratch your head (though if that&#x27;s your goal, it will be satisfying and no cuts will be had).</li>
    <li> I bought 3 of these Kent Hand-Made combs along with 1 Mason Pierson comb.  The Kent combs are less expensive than the Mason Pierson comb and do a good enough job.  They are definitely better than the regular combs that are out there, but they are not as good as the Mason Pierson combs.</li>
    <li> Superior comb. High quality. Arrived very quickly</li>
    <li> It is really amazing. I love the product. It is very soft ang prevents hair falls. It arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know why this is so awesome. But it is. My husband loves it.</li>
    <li> Fine quality. Much better than the cheap plastic combs available. Well worth the price which isn&#x27;t all that much.</li>
    <li> Use this comb for my beard. The coarse/fine is perfect. Will buy a second one. Keep one at home and one in the car.</li>
    <li> This comb is said to be forged in the fires of mordor by the dark lord sauron himself and only when it is thrown back into the fire from whence it came can it be destroyed  and it&#x27;s darkness will be stamped out from the land</li>
    <li> Perfect little comb that has yet to fall apart like other cheap plastic ones.</li>
    <li> Expensive for a pocket comb. I guess the Kent name (with the Royal Warrant) justifies the high price. I&#x27;ve bought men&#x27;s pocket combs for $1.00 which work as well as this one.</li>
    <li> The best and last comb you will ever buy(unless you lose it).  Get this now you won&#x27;t regret it at all.</li>
    <li> I do like the comb for EDC.&lt;br /&gt;Did research the actual length of the comb, but was still relatively surprised that it was so small when I received it.&lt;br /&gt;4/5 stars because it seems a bit overpriced...even though that comes with the Kent name.&lt;br /&gt;Can get same quality at a lower price point.</li>
    <li> Great comb, but a bit pricey.  I should have ordered one with longer teeth.</li>
    <li> Kent makes great combs. I like this better than their folding pocket comb. Works well and slips in your pocket nicely. I use this mostly for beard grooming. Fine side for mustache,  coarse side for beard.</li>
    <li> You would not think it would be so difficult to find something so simple as a quality comb, but here it finally is.</li>
    <li> This is a great quality comb unlike some of the other ones you can find here (I had bought another one of lesser quality and the teeth kept falling off, I can tell it won&#x27;t happen with this one). It does a great job.</li>
    <li> Unlike virtually all other combs, which are molded from plastic, Kent combs are handmade. The manufacturing process begins with a blank piece of high grade plastic from which craftsmen hand cut each comb with a saw, which is then polished to a smooth finish. The resulting comb has a quality feel, pulls smoothly through your hair/beard, and the teeth feel comfortable rubbing against your scalp. In my opinion, the Kent R7T 143mm comb is the best all around pocket comb that Kent offers with both coarse and fine teeth. If you are looking for a similar pocket comb with only fine teeth, I recommend the Kent 7T (link: [[ASIN:B000YB3OQ2 Kent Hand-Made 143mm All Fine Pocket Comb -7T]]). The company (G B Kent &amp; Sons Ltd) has been manufacturers of brushes since the eighteenth century and is one of the oldest established companies in Great Britain. It has royal warrants as \\&quot;Best British Brushes\\&quot; from every British monarch going back to George III. Considering its quality and heritage, this comb is an exceptional value. Treat yourself to the best!</li>
    <li> The teeth are polished so they feel soft and nice on your scalp.  This is not a comb one can buy at CVS, Walgreens or WalMart.  This brand has the best combs....and so worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> This Kent Handmade Comb is wonderful; does not break the ends of your hair; would buy them again; A+ A+</li>
    <li> Great little comb.  I knew this comb was going to be small but I wish I&#x27;d taken out a ruler first to verify size.  It&#x27;s a little smaller than I wanted but that&#x27;s my own fault.  The comb itself is of very nice quality.  It&#x27;s very sturdy and feels like it will hold up to years of use!  The teeth are smooth and I can easily comb hair with this comb.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Very nice comb, it the tips of the teeth are rounded (unlike the sharp points on ACE combs). It&#x27;s pretty thick, very nice looking. I carry mine in my pocket. It&#x27;s definitely the nicest comb I&#x27;ve ever owned. I actually wish I&#x27;d bought two so I could stick one in my shave kit.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband and he loves it! It arrived quickly and was in great shape. He takes it everywhere now and says it feels great on his beard. It&#x27;s just thick enough to comb his beard but not too rough that is scratches or irritates him. It&#x27;s perfect!</li>
    <li> I never thought I would actually spend money on a comb, but am glad I did.  The only problem I have is keeping track of it!  It likes to follow my wallet out of my pocket.  I am already planning on other Kent products!</li>
    <li> This is a great pocket comb. Does the job and I haven&#x27;t had any issues. Those complaining about the size being in mm&#x27;s need to stop being lazy and grab a 12 in ruler (most contain metric) or learn some simple math. I seriously question the reviews where the main issue is the size of the comb when its obviously shown.</li>
    <li> A comb is not a comb.  I have very fine long hair, and find average \\&quot;Ace\\&quot; type molded plastic combs a pain, constantly getting caught and knotting.  Years back I found one of these Kent combs in the local indie pharmacy, and I haven&#x27;t used anything different since.  The difference in quality is noticeable as soon as you handle it, and in my experience it works much better, gliding through the hair without catching or tangling.  If you carry around a pocket comb for impromptu grooming, this is a really good one.      (These days, I actually carry the folding version, also available from Amazon.  It&#x27;s even pricier--$20--but protects the comb&#x27;s teeth, making it much more robust for back-pocket carry.)</li>
    <li> Nice comb it does the job.</li>
    <li> These combs are very very well made and smooth to use.  I have managed to lose my longest one already.  I was using Ace pocket combs for years, but after moving production to China, they are pretty poor now.  When I keep them in my back pocket, after a while some of the teeth break off and I even had one Ace comb break in half.  I don&#x27;t carry the Kent comb, I just keep it out in the bathroom to use after I shower and wash my hair.  I&#x27;m really impressed with them.  I don&#x27;t think Amazon carries them anymore though.</li>
    <li> You may not notice any real difference between this comb and the drug store cheapies, in functionality, but this one will always look cooler on your vanity. It has a good solid feel and heft. I plan to use these for life.</li>
    <li> I got this to replace my Kent pocket comb that was looking a bit shabby after at least 20 years. This one seems to be the same quality. I love that the comb stays smooth and doesn&#x27;t tear the hair. Definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> Solid made comb that doesn&#x27;t scratch the scalp. You can really tell it is hand made. Hope it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I had used Ace and other cheap combs in the past and I cannot believe I never bought a Kent comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comb is top quality and will last you a long time. You don&#x27;t have to worry about the teeth breaking or bending or accidentally scratching your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Fantastic comb, easily the best I&#x27;ve ever owned. No sharp teeth at all, fits well in the hand. I&#x27;m going to buy a bigger size also.  This will last years.</li>
    <li> Ordered one based off the reviews.  Pretty disappointed with the performance overall.  The black plastic ones are actually better, because they flex a little bit so you can feel and adjust the pressure with your hand.  Also, this comb is way too short.  You often have to recomb your hair because the bristles are so close together.  This i&#x27;m only going keep it in my travel bag as a backup, but otherwise would throw it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only positive I can think of is that it is really thick.  But for the reasons I mentioned above, that is not a positive when styling your hair.</li>
    <li> I usually have my hair quite short.  My long term girlfriend finally convinced me to let it grow and get it professional cut compared to a clean, but simple buzz cut from her or friends.  As a result, I needed a comb for the first time.  After reading several reviews, Kent&#x27;s seemed to be the right choice at a reasonable price $8.  I was correct, well made combs.  This size, the 130mm if perfect for a pocket but I wouldn&#x27;t buy one much larger if you anticipate needing it while out and are keeping it in your pocket.  I would expect these to last many years.  100% satisfied.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always hated combs but needed one for facial hair - this comb is fantastic! Handles my coarse, thick hair comfortably. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Received the folding comb twice when attempting to order this comb. Inventory is not correct for this item.</li>
    <li> Comb is thick and the teeth do not comb as well as cheap plastic pocket combs from the drug store. I get more control and manageability from a cheap pocket comb, able to shape my  hair. This Kent comb is like using my fingers to comb my hair, doesn&#x27;t leave fine straight lines like a cheap pocket comb does. I started using my cheap pocket comb again instead. I regret this buy.</li>
    <li> I use to use combs from the dollar store and conair combs too but this comb is way better than any comb ive ever used no doubt. I could really tell the difference between this comb and the dollar combs. If goes through the hair really softly it doesnt tug or pull hair out. It slides really smothly. This comb is not molded it is clearly hand made. It is awesome i really recomend it!!! :)</li>
    <li> This comb is gorgeous! It was very sturdy and combs very well. Also, fits in the pocket perfectly without breaking</li>
    <li> Ladies and gents, this is an artisinally-made pocket comb. It will not bend like those cheap, mass-produced pieces of s*** combs at your local CVS/Walgreens. Feel empowered and pair it with Suavecito to get that greaser look you&#x27;ve always wanted to get but were too much of a pussy to do.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on other reviews.  Is a very marginal comb.  A little small and not better than I could have bought at a drug store for much less.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;d think that all combs are the same. But for whatever reason this one has some magic built in that makes it go smoothly over the hair and will make you look better all around.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t think I would ever be so impressed by a mere comb.. I used Ace combs for years, but it was time for a replacement recently, and wow.. switching to this one was light night and day.  Super smooth, no snags - try it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a decent comb, it is durable and is just the right size.  However, its just a comb.</li>
    <li> my husband&#x27;s comb always breaks, we were excited when we found this one. he really likes using it already. thank you for a well made product</li>
    <li> This is a much better comb than the cheap plastic ones I&#x27;ve been using. The rounded teeth are also much less abrasive on my scalp. Great quality for a great price!</li>
    <li> Bought this comb to replace the $1 ace comb I bought at Walmart. The comb is smaller than I thought it would be but, that&#x27;s mainly because I didn&#x27;t bother to read the description. If I had read the description and realized that this comb is basically only 5.5 inches, I probably would have gone with something with only the fine bristles. Oh well, should have done the metric to inches conversion before I bought it. The comb itself is absolutely wonderful. It&#x27;s stylish and the perfect size to throw in a pocket. I will never return to the plastic ace comb which I used to carry.</li>
    <li> This is a handsome pocket comb for guys who still comb their hair.  Love them and hope these combs will still be available after I have worn out my dozen.</li>
    <li> These combs make drug store types obsolete. They&#x27;re made to last and no roughness. Everyone should have them if possible.</li>
    <li> This comb has a wonderful feel to it in your hand and in your hair.</li>
    <li> This comb is great.  Great quality and good looks.  I use it to comb my thick beard hair.  Much nicer experience than the dollar store combs.  Goes through hair nicely and feels very sturdy.</li>
    <li> This handmade comb is of high quality. I recommend its purchase.</li>
    <li> Wonderful comb. Runs through my hair more smoothly and with less irritation than cheap plastic combs without any snagging, twisting or painful scraping from sharpened teeth points. I like the extra weight it has as I have very thick hair and I enjoy the feeling of a substantial comb going through my hair nice and straight rather than bending like so many other plastic combs do. Now I need to get a larger size.</li>
    <li> Excellent comb, very high quality, fast service.</li>
    <li> When I use to work in England I bought the same combs made by Kent.  They are rugged and high quality.  The fit nicely within my back pocket and they do not break!  I was really happy to be able to purchase this comb back here in the USA!</li>
    <li> A big difference! This comb is like zen. Simple, elegant, substantial and beautiful. Hard to believe how much better this works than its cheap counterparts. Bought 1 then 4 more.</li>
    <li> Kent combs are simply the best. This works well as an every day comb. Shapes hair easily and has a solid build quality.</li>
    <li> I have fairly coarse hair and usually use both a brush and a comb after showering to keep things neat. For the longest time I&#x27;d been using cheap drugstore combs, but decided to &amp;#34;splurge&amp;#34; on this $8 item while getting some other grooming products from Amazon. I was genuinely surprised by the result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have thought that making a comb was a solved problem in this day and age, and that one comb would be just as good as another. This Kent comb, however, is sturdy. The plastic is thick and rigid, but smooth, and the tips of the teeth are so smooth and polished that they feel soft against your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This *particular* comb was a bit shorter than I expected (should have used a ruler to estimate 143mm, my bad), but that too turned out to be a benefit as it&#x27;s easy to pocket and stick in my travel kit. I&#x27;ve recommended this comb to several people by now (I&#x27;ve had mine for about 3 years or so), and all have been surprised (in a good way).</li>
    <li> Wife bought this comb and she said she really enjoyed using it. So I decided to give it a try and I didn&#x27;t think combs mattered this much, but damn this comb is really well made and does a great job.</li>
    <li> Great high quality comb that is perfect for bringing along in my pocket.</li>
    <li> This comb is the same size as your standard Ace pocket comb that you can find in any drugstore. However, it&#x27;s a Kent comb, so you won&#x27;t need to buy another one ever again. These things are built tough. This comb is very thick and very sturdy, but it still fits perfectly in my pocket. If you&#x27;re looking for a pocket comb then this is it.</li>
    <li> Best comb I&#x27;ve owned. I use it with Suavecito Pomade to make my hair stay down and not stick up. This comb does the job that a brush cannot. Leaves nice closed lines on your hair. I also use the thin side to comb my beard with beard oil. 2-in-1 for me. Great quality. Buy it!</li>
    <li> Very nice quality comb at a affordable price</li>
    <li> You will never go back to buying ACE combs at drug stores.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sad,  I lost this comb,  It was wonderful while I had it.  I&#x27;ll order another identical Kent Comb.  I don&#x27;t want to go back to the cheap black ones.</li>
    <li> Seems most combs a man finds are cheap second thought items, Kent makes a solid comb that will last, not a model car molded plastic.</li>
    <li> bought as a gift and he loves it. threw his old dollarstore plastic comb away.</li>
    <li> This is very durable and well made comb. You really do get what you pay for. Would recommend buying this to anyone who is tired of cheap flimsy combs.</li>
    <li> I like its look and feel.</li>
    <li> I recently grew my hair out and started styling it like a gentleman. I never realized how terrible a lot of those other combs were. This comb does such a great job getting my hair into place without tugging on it. It is well built, the teeth are uniform and it feels so sturdy. Been using it about a month, wouldn&#x27;t use another. The stamps have started wearing off though.</li>
    <li> Its more expensive than most but also more &amp;#34;substantial&amp;#34;  Great comb to throw in your pocket as you head out the door</li>
    <li> After a lifetime of using cheap plastic combs, I finally got tired of them snapping in half on me, and a little quick research turned up this \\&quot;unbreakable\\&quot; Kent comb. It&#x27;s a little pricey at ~$10 (vs $1), but worth it: It looks good; I haven&#x27;t been able to break it in the past 6 months, and its flat smooth prongs don&#x27;t scratch your scalp like the cheapies usually do. A Great stocking-stuffer gift.</li>
    <li> I love this comb for beard &amp; mustache care.  While working on my &amp;#34;yeard&amp;#34; I have tried several different products to tame the beast, and this is by far the best comb I&#x27;ve run across.  I never get pulling, or cut hairs, like with an extruded plastic comb, and the spacing on the tines is much better than my stainless steel comb.  Having the option of fine, or course tines allows you to manage your beard and mustache with a single comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still recommend having a companion boar&#x27;s hair brush for distribution of beard oil/balm, but for general maintenance and taming the furry face beast, nothing beats a Kent comb.</li>
    <li> combs last a LONG time, will purchase again IF needed, excellent product</li>
    <li> Best comb I&#x27;ve ever seen or used, very sturdy and it doesn&#x27;t have the usual ridges and sharp corners like the drugstore injection mold type. Carry it every day.</li>
    <li> I think every man should have a Kent comb....and no other comb, at that. It&#x27;s small, handy, combs super well and is very easy to clean. Also, it&#x27;s so sturdy. I&#x27;ve had mine for 5 years already, I think.</li>
    <li> These Kent combs are definitely a big step up in quality, performance, and durability from drugstore plastic combs, but is it worth 10 times the price? I suppose they are still cheap enough for you to buy one and find out for yourself. Note that the length is not the advertised 143mm. The one I bought from Amazon is only 130mm long.</li>
    <li> So well made.  Durable and smooth.  I&#x27;ve only had to buy one which is a relief because the cheap Ace Combs that I get at WalMart had to be replaced every two or three weeks.</li>
    <li> This comb is legit. it is thick and sturdy and you can tell it is handmade. Not that you need a heavy duty comb, but it is cool knowing that this was crafted not just molded in some mega factory. classic look too</li>
    <li> Bomb comb. &#x27;Nuff said.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s my Forever comb.  Never had anything like this in 60 years.  It should be part of Obamacare give away.</li>
    <li> I like this comb, I dont really use combs now but im very familiar with them and this ones solid, not to pointy tongs, nicely spaced, support french handmade i believe, and seems to be good all around.  I like the strength although my hair isnt thick.  The wider end works nicely to touch up.  Ergonomic.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d write a review for a comb, but oh my, this is one fantastic comb. Fits in my back pocket, handmade thick and sturdy. Small enough I hardly notice when I sit. Classic tortoise-shell look, feel really &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; when I take out this comb to pass it through my hair. The gold letterings on the comb wear off after awhile, which may be a pro/con depending on how you like branding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, please note the size of the teeth in line with what your preferred hair style is. If you&#x27;re into the &amp;#34;fingers through hair&amp;#34; wavy look, this is too fine of a comb to pull that off. I&#x27;d suggest looking for something a little larger or with spacier teeth.</li>
    <li> the standard for combs for men. trust me guys you can never use a POS plastic ever again. this will last a life time.</li>
    <li> Excellent comb, it is very well made and does not scrap the scalp. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great quality and durable. Small enough to be place in the pocket.</li>
    <li> I thought maybe the reviews were hype but no doubt this is a great comb in every way. I just wonder why it is a bit overpriced....just for a comb. I&#x27;m not seeing it. At any rate this really is a GREAT comb, you really won&#x27;t want to use any other comb after this one.</li>
    <li> Quality comb, works great, looks good, easier to find than black combs.  Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> The Kent combs cost too much.  This is an expensive comb.  However, they are much better than the Mason Pearson combs, thicker, stronger, longer lasting and not as expensive as M P combs.  The Kent combs are smooth, well manufactured and the cost is what it is.  I bought cheaper combs and returned to the Kent.  Pricey, yes, worth it, yes.&lt;br /&gt;I have several choices buying the combs, but my choice of vendor is R S out of England.  They have  the best customer service  and as good or better pricing.&lt;br /&gt;The combs are not unbreakable, they will crack from time to time..  That is why the vendor is so important.</li>
    <li> Hands down best comb, worth the money. Perfect for beard!</li>
    <li> This comb is really, really nice.  I love the way it feels going through my hair.  I never much thought about combs before, but after owning this one, I&#x27;ll never buy a cheap comb again (not that this one is expensive either!).</li>
    <li> Great comb.  You can see the difference in quality as soon as you hold it.  I&#x27;ll never use a cheap plastic one again.</li>
    <li> This comb is probably better than it has to be. It&#x27;s a little smaller than my last pocket comb, but it works well and is of very good quality. I&#x27;ve noticed no static in dry hair if that&#x27;s important to you. They don&#x27;t really claim it&#x27;s unbreakable, but the material feels very solid. Seems more solid than my last unbreakable comb which broke.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair which can be torn apart by combs with rough edges.  All edges on these combs have been finished so  none of them are rough.  These combs are gentle on the hair and on the eye.  I think they&#x27;re pretty as well as functional.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used ACE combs for years but recently their quality seems to have taken a downturn.  They seem to be using cheaper plastic and less of it so that the tips now drag and scratch your scalp. So I searched Amazon and found these combs. It took several tries and many purchases to find the perfect length.  This is it. It&#x27;s not too small. the 110 mm ones were too small and easy to lose. Not too big so as to stick out your back. And the fine quality of the material prevents it from scratching your scalp. This is in short the perfect pocket comb.</li>
    <li> 20 years ago I bought a Mason Pearson brush - it was recommended - good quality and expensive.  Then 5 years ago when I was in England I asked for another MP brush and they suggested I try Kent.  I did and I liked it then and like the combs even more.  To compare the combs - I have both MP and Kent - the MP is thinner and flexes more than the Kent.  The Kent feels more substantial in my hand.  Really like them...</li>
    <li> Breaks easily.  While I have had combs break in my pocket before, it has not happened since I was in high school in the 60s.&lt;br /&gt;My pocket combs typically last 4 or more years until I lose them.&lt;br /&gt;Seller &amp;#34;Day Dream&amp;#34; offered me no recourse since item was not &amp;#34;NEW products in original box&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I was really startled and disappointed to find this broken Kent comb in my pocket as otherwise I really liked this comb.&lt;br /&gt;For pocket use, I suggest you buy another brand of comb.</li>
    <li> By far the best comb I have ever used. I used to just get the cheap black combs, but the teeth would always break off, so I got this in the hopes that wouldn&#x27;t be a problem. So far it isn&#x27;t, and based on the feel of it, I don&#x27;t think it ever will be. In any case it is of far superior quality than the cheap black combs.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s face it. How many of us truly give much thought to the qualities a good comb should have? Not many. Kent makes exceptionally good combs, including this model. They are very solid and very comfortable when combing across your scalp. Compare this with an Ace comb, for example, and your scalp will get pretty scratched up. Kent polishes the ends of the teeth so they&#x27;re nothing but smooth. Buy this.</li>
    <li> If you are searching for this brand you probably already know about the high quality. This is not a cheap plastic pocket comb. These are made with precision and built to last. You might pay a little extra but it is well worth it.</li>
    <li> Not only does it fit any pocket well, it also combs any type of hair well! I have had mine for years and I wouldn&#x27;t have it exchanged with any, more expensive combs out there. Even my GF loves it. She addicted to &amp;#34;stealing&amp;#34; it from me from time to time. It makes the hair look silky smooth after a couple of strokes because the teeth are very fine. It&#x27;s very easy to clean too and of course, yes, it&#x27;s very handy!</li>
    <li> Great product,very durable,great size and great price,well worth it. Recommend A++</li>
    <li> This is by far the best comb I have ever owned.  Look, if you are on the fence about whether or not to buy this comb, you are foolishly wasting time. It is an absolute delight. Buy it now.</li>
    <li> This is the best small comb I have ever had!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reasonably price, this comb is well-made.  The high quality is obvious as soon as you run it through your hair.</li>
    <li> Solid comb, fits in your pocket nice and easy like.</li>
    <li> These are somewhat hard to find but are some of the best on the market. Definitely worth the slightly extra cost!</li>
    <li> I purchased this comb as a gift, it is much smaller in the real life</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice comb. Period.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t get a better comb for the price!!</li>
    <li> Nice and smooth, durable as well. The letters printed on it wore off after a day or two but who cares.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why I paid this much for a comb. It works like any other comb I could find from a local dollar store but I was being lazy.</li>
    <li> A fine quality comb I use for my large beard and mustache.</li>
    <li> Very well made. Very pleased</li>
    <li> Very well made comb. Does not feel cheap or flimsy at all. Love the color as well.</li>
    <li> I got this comb for my Beard. And its like a hot knife through butter. I never thought to myself that I would buy a comb more then a couple of dollars. Well I can now say I would never buy a cheap comb again. No snags, or anything. Just a nice quality comb.</li>
    <li> High quality, wont break in your pocket. Handmade comb. The variation in between the teeth are convenient for longer hair.</li>
    <li> Beautiful quality, nice size, shape. Gave as a gift, was appreciated!</li>
    <li> Due to hedonistic adaptation, I convinced myself that I needed a fine gentlemen&#x27;s comb. Problem #1 was that this comb is for my medicine cabinet so no one ever sees it or cares. Problem #2 is that I have some thick hair and the bristles just feel too thick and not long enough. Probably good on the go if you like to pull out a sexy looking comb and slick back your hair in front of the ladies. I have the Ace comb http://www.amazon.com/Ace-Classic-Dressing-Comb-Inches/dp/B0065JC4PE/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1416195767&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;ace+comb and I prefer it to this one.</li>
    <li> This comb feels like a quality product. In fact, it feels and looks like the finest comb I have ever used. I have a Swiss-made Baxter of California comb, too, and this feels/looks ten times better.</li>
    <li> These are well made combs.  In the past, I used the generic ACE combs which were really abrasive on my scalp since the teeth are sharp.  At times, my ACE combs teeth broke as well.  So far, this Kent comb hasn&#x27;t failed me yet.  Its teeth is comfortable against my scalp and it&#x27;s thick which in my observations so far won&#x27;t be as easy to break since I carry it in my pocket when I&#x27;m out and about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is pretty steep for a simple comb, but knowing that I&#x27;ve spent about $12 on a comb, I won&#x27;t be more inclined to accidentally lose it.</li>
    <li> Best and nicest comb I have ever used.  MUST HAVE, I repeat, must have if you have a beard!</li>
</ol>
