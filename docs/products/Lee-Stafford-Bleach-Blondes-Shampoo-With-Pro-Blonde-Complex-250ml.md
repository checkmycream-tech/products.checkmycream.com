      <li>that I know this product is so good &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>Makes my hair feel very soft and it looks and feels wonderful.</li>
      <li>I love the smell, which is spicy, earthy, and warm.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m deducting a star because I&#x27;ve had shampoos that would lather more nicely and easily than this one</li>
      <li>and I love the fragrance as well!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
      <li>love the fragrance - my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>i can tell my hair is so much more blonder when i use it and the conditoiner.</li>
      <li>and NOW I know why :)</li>
      <li>It smells very nice and lathers up very well.</li>
      <li>- it could use more moisture (even though I used the Lee Stafford Bleach Blondes Conditioner after shampooing), but it&#x27;s also still pretty good</li>
      <li>I have color-treated hair, but I have also seen natural blond(e)s use this with great results.</li>
      <li>shampoo itself is a very dark indigo color - great sign!</li>
      <li>I do not like harsh chemical fragrances, so this fragrance is perfect for me.</li>
      <li>: Works amazing, best purple shampoo out there, leave in for a night; turns hair purple and silver (which fades of course) , almost liquidy consistency, i use everyday and alternate once a week to eliminate purple shampoo build up</li>
      <li>Let me start by appreciating the super speedy delivery of this item.</li>
      <li>I have tried many different brands of purple shampoo and this is my favorite.</li>
      <li>It is also extremely reasonably priced which is an added bonus!!</li>
      <li>and the results are definitely worth it.</li>
      <li>I use it every other day and each time I use it my results get better and better.</li>
      <li>Before this one my hair was turning really brassy and in one use this product toned my color down to the perfect cool shade of blonde that I wanted.</li>
      <li>I conditioned with a deep conditioner after (just to be safe) and my hair feels so soft and healthy</li>
      <li>Works pretty well for the price.  </li>
      <li>Does exactly what it should.</li>
      <li>, DON&#x27;T HESITATE!&lt;br /&gt;NO MORE BRASSY BLONDE</li>
      <li>The product produces exactly the results I am looking for.</li>
      <li>I am going to give other products a try too, but I will return to this happily if I cannot find stuff locally.</li>
      <li>just make sure not too leave it in too long</li>
      <li>With the smell aside, it really brightens yellow hair into a cool platinum color, but if used too often by itself, my hair turns lavender!</li>
      <li>It was more pink that purple</li>
      <li>Thanks so much</li>
      <li>I also appreciate how carefully the product (+ two more I ordered from this seller) was packaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I also use the conditioner with this as well which I would highly recommend!</li>
      <li>It is more sharp and decadent.</li>
      <li>/&gt;-does not turn neutral nail polish purple (this is a downside for me because it tells me the product actually has color to correct the tone)&lt;br /&gt;-not on PETAs list of animal friendly products</li>
      <li>I actually find the purplish hue quite cool and don&#x27;t mind it</li>
      <li>especially those weakened and damaged strands on top of my head that don&#x27;t have much color left in them...</li>
      <li>but it did a decent job.</li>
      <li>Have had no negative reactions thus far!</li>
      <li>/&gt;- the packaging is practical, although it&#x27;s just a plastic tube - nothing extra special; but I&#x27;ve had enough troubles with shampoo bottles in my life to be able to appreciate something &#x27;normal&#x27; that I can easily open even with wet hands</li>
      <li>Some brassy locks looked near platinum!</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was expecting / needing - I will definitely be purchasing this again!&lt;br</li>
      <li>If I use this more than once a week, my blonde hair gets a little pinkish.</li>
      <li>on the other hand, those are the same stains you&#x27;d make while using any shampoo except this time you can see them... and don&#x27;t worry, they rinse out easily</li>
      <li>I highlight my platinum hair with lavender highlights, and this does double-duty: eliminates the brassiness completely and accentuates the lavender cast to my hair.</li>
      <li>IT SMELLS LIKE OLD SPICE.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;- works at early signs of brassines&lt;</li>
      <li>- so don&#x27;t be surprised if you never used any purple shampoo</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be switching back as soon as my new bottle arrives.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall not a great product, but better than John Frieda&#x27;s comparable one.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m not super extra excited by the quality of my hair after it&#x27;s dried</li>

<li> As such, it&#x27;s naturally dry and prone to brassiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> the shampoo itself is dark purple colored - about the same color as the tube</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair as much as other purple shampoos.  </li>
<li> so really, BE CAREFUL</li>
<li> After placing my order I received a confirmation e-mail stating that the expected delivery date would be in about a month.</li>
<li> /&gt;- now, BE CAREFUL and DO observe the instructions saying you shouldn&#x27;t use this shampoo too often or leave it on for too long: the thing DOES tone your hair and after just 1 (ONE) use I ended up with slightly purplish strands -</li>
<li> blonde.&lt;br /&gt;I find it little stiff for my hair, it feels dry</li>
<li> Does this work for dark black hair ?</li>
<li> price ( less than 1/2 of Fudge comparable</li>
<li> I use this once a week or less.</li>
<li> one got one half off for this product.</li>
<li> As some of the other reviews mentions, it will turn your hair a slight shade of lavender if you use it excessively and the smell is a bit &#x27;musty/manly&#x27; but my conditioner covers that</li>
<li> I have used other purple shampoos in the past.</li>
<li> its a little too aromatherapy...</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not drying or harsh.  </li>
<li> This product really helps to prevent that ugly brassy color.</li>

<li> usually s</li>
<li> /&gt;After using this shampoo, I noticed an immediate and dramatic change.</li>
<li> I was really tired of bleaching my hair and it turning an awful yellow color</li>
<li> I would definatly recommend this to anyone looking for something to get that awful yellow or brassy look out.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Neutralized my brassy tones instantly. I recommend to ALL bottle jobs.</li>
    <li> Great product. I love the smell, which is spicy, earthy, and warm. I do not like harsh chemical fragrances, so this fragrance is perfect for me. I use this once a week or less. If I use this more than once a week, my blonde hair gets a little pinkish. The product produces exactly the results I am looking for. It keeps my color from getting brassy. I have color-treated hair, but I have also seen natural blond(e)s use this with great results. This product really helps to prevent that ugly brassy color.</li>
    <li> Good product, but pricey.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is amazing. I highlight my platinum hair with lavender highlights, and this does double-duty: eliminates the brassiness completely and accentuates the lavender cast to my hair. Plus, it cleans well and smells great!</li>
    <li> Does this work for dark black hair ?</li>
    <li> No waiting for results with this purple shampoo!  The brassiness was noticably lessened after 1 use.  I plan to use this 1-2 weekly.  I conditioned with a deep conditioner after (just to be safe) and my hair feels so soft and healthy I don&#x27;t think the deep conditioner is necessary .. regular conditioner would do.  It&#x27;s not drying or harsh.  Works great and is a really good product.  I found mine at ULTA for 10 bucks.  I would order if I couldn&#x27;t find it locally though.</li>
    <li> Only used once but it is all that the reviews said it is.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it should. It has balanced my colour perfectly and I love the fragrance as well!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to order the conditioner now that I know this product is so good &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaged well so it wouldn&#x27;t leak and arrived earlier than expected.</li>
    <li> I have used other purple shampoos in the past. This one works but I have to leave it on for a substantial amount of time - the smell is not gross but it&#x27;s not to my personal liking either, its a little too aromatherapy... I probably will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> This has a rich, velvety, flowery smell without having the suffocating &amp;#34;old-lady perfume&amp;#34; smell to it. It is more sharp and decadent. With the smell aside, it really brightens yellow hair into a cool platinum color, but if used too often by itself, my hair turns lavender! I use this 1-2 times a week, mixed with other shampoos. I am going to give other products a try too, but I will return to this happily if I cannot find stuff locally.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- price ( less than 1/2 of Fudge comparable product)&lt;br /&gt;- Not tested on animals (per lee stafford&#x27;s web site)&lt;br /&gt;- works at early signs of brassines&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- does not lather well&lt;br /&gt;- takes a few uses to get rid of really brassy color&lt;br /&gt;-does not turn neutral nail polish purple (this is a downside for me because it tells me the product actually has color to correct the tone)&lt;br /&gt;-not on PETAs list of animal friendly products&lt;br /&gt;- and biggest of all IT SMELLS LIKE OLD SPICE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall not a great product, but better than John Frieda&#x27;s comparable one.  I&#x27;d recommend in investing in Fudge if you want one that has it all though.  I&#x27;ll be switching back as soon as my new bottle arrives.</li>
    <li> Let me start by appreciating the super speedy delivery of this item. After placing my order I received a confirmation e-mail stating that the expected delivery date would be in about a month. That disappointed me a bit but I thought I could take it since they&#x27;re shipping from overseas. Well, in just 5 days the package landed in my mailbox! I also appreciate how carefully the product (+ two more I ordered from this seller) was packaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now about the product itself:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- the packaging is practical, although it&#x27;s just a plastic tube - nothing extra special; but I&#x27;ve had enough troubles with shampoo bottles in my life to be able to appreciate something &#x27;normal&#x27; that I can easily open even with wet hands&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- the shampoo itself is dark purple colored - about the same color as the tube - so don&#x27;t be surprised if you never used any purple shampoo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- it also means it may stain your bathtub - on the other hand, those are the same stains you&#x27;d make while using any shampoo except this time you can see them... and don&#x27;t worry, they rinse out easily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- now, BE CAREFUL and DO observe the instructions saying you shouldn&#x27;t use this shampoo too often or leave it on for too long: the thing DOES tone your hair and after just 1 (ONE) use I ended up with slightly purplish strands - especially those weakened and damaged strands on top of my head that don&#x27;t have much color left in them... I actually find the purplish hue quite cool and don&#x27;t mind it but I&#x27;m not sure this is everybody else&#x27;s case... so really, BE CAREFUL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I&#x27;m deducting a star because I&#x27;ve had shampoos that would lather more nicely and easily than this one (but it&#x27;s still good) and I&#x27;m not super extra excited by the quality of my hair after it&#x27;s dried - it could use more moisture (even though I used the Lee Stafford Bleach Blondes Conditioner after shampooing), but it&#x27;s also still pretty good</li>
    <li> This has been perfect for my hair. I have tried many different brands of purple shampoo and this is my favorite. Before this one my hair was turning really brassy and in one use this product toned my color down to the perfect cool shade of blonde that I wanted. It is also extremely reasonably priced which is an added bonus!! Who doesn&#x27;t want an awesome product at a great price!!</li>
    <li> It was more pink that purple but it did a decent job. just make sure not too leave it in too long or it will tint your hair.</li>
    <li> Smells great! Works pretty well for the price.  Doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair as much as other purple shampoos.  Doesn&#x27;t stain your hands.</li>
    <li> love the color and the smell! i can tell my hair is so much more blonder when i use it and the conditoiner. and it doesnt dry out my hair which i like.</li>
    <li> Let me make this quick:&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Works amazing, best purple shampoo out there, leave in for a night; turns hair purple and silver (which fades of course) , almost liquidy consistency, i use everyday and alternate once a week to eliminate purple shampoo build up but everyone is different. You wont regret it smells wonderful not like shimmer lights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Cheaper at Ulta, they usually have the buy one got one half off for this product.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was expecting / needing - I will definitely be purchasing this again!&lt;br /&gt;If you have any doubts about buying this, DON&#x27;T HESITATE!&lt;br /&gt;NO MORE BRASSY BLONDE</li>
    <li> I am on a quest for the best purple shampoo and by jove, I think I found it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have shoulder length curly blond hair which I process monthly. As such, it&#x27;s naturally dry and prone to brassiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo itself is a very dark indigo color - great sign! It smells very nice and lathers up very well. I&#x27;ll need to check the label and update - usually s good lather means SLS in the ingredients which is drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this shampoo, I noticed an immediate and dramatic change. Some brassy locks looked near platinum! Horrah!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Such a great price and a great product. A must have for your platinum &amp; silver hair.</li>
    <li> I like how this shampoo keeps my blonde hair blonde.&lt;br /&gt;I find it little stiff for my hair, it feels dry but I only use it once in a while.&lt;br /&gt;I love the fragrance - my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I can complain about is that the cap leaks so I have the bottle standing on a face cloth in my shower.  The purple color will otherwise stain my shelf.</li>
    <li> I guess I needed bleach blonde hair to see results. I based my rating on how well it cleansed my hair and the fact that I did not experience dryness or buildup.</li>
    <li> Works amazingly well, reduces the brassiness in my hair. As some of the other reviews mentions, it will turn your hair a slight shade of lavender if you use it excessively and the smell is a bit &#x27;musty/manly&#x27; but my conditioner covers that and the results are definitely worth it. Plus, the price is great.</li>
    <li> I was really tired of bleaching my hair and it turning an awful yellow color so I researched this product and I now love it! I use it every other day and each time I use it my results get better and better. I would definatly recommend this to anyone looking for something to get that awful yellow or brassy look out.&lt;br /&gt;Very Speedy Delivery as well which I was very pleased with! I also use the conditioner with this as well which I would highly recommend! Makes my hair feel very soft and it looks and feels wonderful. The smell is also very nice!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is the reason I haven&#x27;t given up on my blonde hair. No yellows! I was searching for this and actually found it by doing a google search &amp;#34; what is the BEST shampoo for blonde hair?&amp;#34; and this was #1 rated best! and NOW I know why :) Thanks so much</li>
    <li> Smells great, leaves my hair feeling great. Have had no negative reactions thus far!</li>
