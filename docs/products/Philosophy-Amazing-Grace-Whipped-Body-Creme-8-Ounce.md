<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> she loved it,and i love the scent of her entire body which i ravaged with extreme passion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m absolutely in LOVE with Philosophy&#x27;s Whipped Body Creme, and I wanted to try the Amazing Grace. It does what it says, applies to the skin beautifully, making the skin soft. What I love most is the feel of this lotion; it&#x27;s like whipped egg whites! The scent wasn&#x27;t my favorite, but it&#x27;s not deterring me to not use it! I love this lotion! The product was received quickly and undamaged. I recommend purchasing from this seller. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best body creme ever..it smells yummy and works on..the entire body.&lt;br /&gt;I am almost 69 yrs old.This makes my skin feel pampered!!</li>
    <li> I had smelled this scent a few years ago, and loved it.  Had forgotten about it though until I saw it on Philosophy&#x27;s site.  Didn&#x27;t have a lot to spend, and I needed a body moisturizer so thought I&#x27;d try it.  I opened it and was very disappointed by the near lack of scent.  I do really like the texture of the cream, it&#x27;s thick and leaves skin feeling silky, so it wasn&#x27;t a total bust.</li>
    <li> Love this scent. I thought it would be a old lady perfumey smell but its heaven to put on and the smell is very pleasant.</li>
    <li> feels very good on and get many compliments on the scent.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my mother for her birthday. She loves it! My sister borrowed some from my mom and is now buying some for herself.</li>
    <li> i was given this by a friend for my birthday. my daughter loved it so much she wanted some also. So, i ordered it for her birthday. she was very pleased..Thank you for this item..</li>
    <li> My new \\&quot;signature\\&quot; fragrance.  Truly a \\&quot;whipped\\&quot; creamy lotion ~ the feel on my skin is delicate, moisturizing and beautifully fragrant. LOVE!</li>
    <li> Feels luscious but scent doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
    <li> Love it...So rich and creamy !</li>
    <li> I love this crème, I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> replacement. However I did use some of it, and did not realize it to the second day I had it.  I would recommend that product to anyone, because it is diffenitely , high quality creme. It goes on so smooth and cremey.  I wish that I could of used it as a gift to give to my neice. But because it is cracked, I decided to use it myself;&lt;br /&gt;Thank  You  God Bless  You  e-mail &amp;#34; yvonnerw60@aol.com</li>
    <li> This is a nice moisturizing cream, but the smell quickly fades.  I cannot believe that Philosophy cannot find a vehicle that will both moisturize and hold a scent.  Due to this fact, I would not purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Nice light scent.  Absorbs quickly.  Doesn&#x27;t feel super moisturizing, but it is great for a daily out of the shower lotion for body.  I am pretty sensitive to scents on my own body - and this doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this as a gift for three wonderful ladies. My mother, my Auntie, (twin sisters)at 90 years old,  and a wonderful friend in Long Island that recently turned 92. Mom and my Auntie love it and tell me that it really makes their skin feel soft and smooth. It truly is an amazing graceful quality product from what I&#x27;ve so far heard.</li>
    <li> It was nice to find a source that provides a product that I use at a more reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;I will use Amazon again for such products.</li>
    <li> Nice creme and pleasant subtle fragrance.  I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> Moisturizes well, but it doesn&#x27;t have quite the same fabulous fragrance as before.</li>
    <li> This creme has a wonderful fragrance that lasts all day, even if you wash your hands several times..&lt;br /&gt;I bought one for myself and one for my daughter as a gift.</li>
    <li> I love the richness of this creme and the Amazing Grace fragrance so this is a perfect combo.  I previously purchased this creme when it was in a tube but it now comes in a tub which is better because you can get it all.  While the price was the same on Amazon as it is at Sephora, I didn&#x27;t have to pay tax and it was shipped via 2-day free because I have Prime.  I also didn&#x27;t have to go to the mall.</li>
    <li> Smells so clean and fresh.  Love this fragrance, and others comment on how pleasant it smells.</li>
    <li> The best body  cream ever! The fragrance last all day!</li>
    <li> This is definitely different than the body butter! This one is smoother, creamier and I&#x27;m beyond thrilled that I found it! I used it this morning, partnering it with the spray mist and now I&#x27;m wallowing in the scent of Amazing Grace! If the Philosophy products weren&#x27;t so expensive, I&#x27;d purchase them more often. This, however, I just COULD NOT pass up! I DO see myself purchasing this again, though - it&#x27;s just too scrumptious and this scent is one of my all-time favorites! I also ordered the Pure Grace Whipped Body Cream because I already have that body mist, also, so I can&#x27;t wait for that to arrive (probably tomorrow) and wallow in THAT scent! Amazing Grace and Pure Grace really ARE my favorite scents!</li>
    <li> My wife love this cream.  She says it&#x27;s has a buttery whipped consistency and dries clean, with no greasy residue.  Her favorite so far.</li>
    <li> Brings me peace just smelling it.  I love all these products.  Most especially all the Graces.  Happy with purchase. Love</li>
    <li> I love this body cream.  It&#x27;s light as air and smells different at different points of the day.  If you sweat, it smells amazing, yet it smells amazing when your body is cool as well.  Love this product.</li>
    <li> It compliments the perfume and makes the skin feel soft.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because I LOVE the amazing grace scent. This has absolutely no scent that I can detect. Very disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it three stars because the creme itself goes on smooth as silk and helps my skin stay soft all day. However - the price is outrageous considering there isn&#x27;t any scent.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this product but greatly disappointed when I opened it.  There is no fragrance!  Amazing Grace has such a clean and refreshing smell but this creme had nothing.  The creme was waxy on my skin too and I didn&#x27;t like that.  Wonderful name but misused in this product.  It should be Philosophy Creme.  Very unhappy with this purchase but Amazon made my return easy.</li>
    <li> My husband ordered this cream for Christmas for me. He had read previous reviews. This is my new favorite cream! It&#x27;s thick enough for wintry-dry skin and the smell is not overpowering, but very delightful! I will order this cream again for my lizard dry skin!</li>
    <li> Love this cream.  I&#x27;ve turned some friends onto it too.</li>
    <li> I like the cream but the smell doesn&#x27;t last as long as the emulsion cream. The next time I order, I will go with the emulsion cream.</li>
    <li> I love my amazing grace body creme. It is my favorite philosophy scent and I will continue to purchase this product. The price was alot more reasonable than purchasing it at a store.</li>
    <li> I  have used this product before and it is exactly as advertised and much more for my skin. I recommend everyone to try this product</li>
    <li> Love the Philosophy Amazing Grace Whipped Body Crème, 8  Philosophy, Inc. It smells wonderful. My skin looks better than it ever did.&lt;br /&gt;The service was excellent !!&lt;br /&gt;ML</li>
    <li> not as whipped as i hoped but still philosophy always has excellent products. smell is soft and clean and it does absorb nicely leaving you feel smooth and silky.</li>
    <li> I love this creme.....my hands feel so good when I use it.</li>
    <li> I Love it!  Clean and fresh!  I feel fresh all day.  No sticky feeling as I did with other products.  I purchased it for the first time at a department store after trying a sample.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years.  I dearly love it.  I do not buy any other perfumes or body lotions.  It&#x27;s as if is was made for me.  It has a light fresh scent and I get compliments all the time.  I have told so many people about this.  I get stopped in stores, my doctor&#x27;s office, churlch and many more places asking what I was wearing.  I can&#x27;t really smell it when I am wearing it, but I promise you everyone else does.  In fact I have  3 sister who love it too!  I promise , if you buy it, you will love it, and you wont regret it..  Also,  Amazon had the best price on the whipped body creme.  It also makes wonderful birthday and Christmas presents or a just because present!!!!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite Philosophy product, but just bought the face wash, so it could be when I first use it! Love all Philosophy products that I&#x27;ve used. Love the scent...it really is heavenly...you want to eat it! Beautiful product in every way. And although it may seem expensive, actually lasts over a month using every day, on my legs, arms, neck, feet. It&#x27;s worth it anyway. Buy it, you&#x27;ll love how it absorbs with no greasy feel, and smells, without overwhelming the senses.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I love, love, this product.  The scent is marvelous and it feels so good.  People always ask what I&#x27;m wearing and when I tell them they are always surprised it is not perfume. I continually buy it.</li>
    <li> LOVE the scent and body creme absorbs instantly.</li>
    <li> Sakura 38176 10-Piece Gelly Roll Assorted Colors Blister Card Moonlight Gel...&lt;br /&gt;Sakura of America&lt;br /&gt;Click the stars to rate it</li>
    <li> I had never tried Philosophy products before as I thought them too expensive. I first learned about them on QVC T.V.. Philosophy puts together special pricing deals for QVC, however the bundles are too expensive for me. I decided to look on Amazon &amp; was pleasantly surprised to find single products at reasonable prices &amp; sizes. After trying Amazing Grace I fell in love with it. The fragrance stays on your body for about five to six hours...I was so surprised. I will purchase my Philosophy products from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have recently found the Philosophy brand of creams, lotions &amp; body wash. Amazing Grace has a nice feminine scent and the body cream makes your skin feel soft (not at all greasy).</li>
    <li> A special treat for my daughter. She loves it.</li>
    <li> I really like the smell of Amazing Grace, and after getting the 2 in 1 shower gel and this whipped body cr&amp;egrave;me for Christmas, I have found this is what I turn to when I want to relax and feel calm and peaceful. This whipped cr&amp;egrave;me  leaves my legs and body feeling silky smooth and softly scented. I like to use it  before bedtime with the shower gel, to layer the scent and help it to last a bit longer. This is what I had brought to the hospital to use when I had my last baby.I have even used this body cr&amp;egrave;me and the matching shower gel on my baby with no skin irritations, and he smells wonderful. The reason for just 4 stars is that (to me, at least) its kind of an older woman smell. Something my mother or grandmother would like. I guess that&#x27;s what makes it so comforting. I will defiantly purchase this again as well as other Philosophy products.</li>
    <li> Thick emollient touched with my favorite Amazing Grace fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;I mix a bit in my hand with my usual Cetophil an apply after a shower.&lt;br /&gt;No need for extra perfume.</li>
    <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried it you need too. Philosophy makes a great product......Nice and clean smell and it works!</li>
    <li> I will enjoy the product thank you</li>
    <li> A Little different fragrance  but in the same family.....subtle.</li>
    <li> Fragrance and consistency not of original product, not satisfied, will continue to  purchase from QVC .</li>
    <li> This product is the greatest. The smell lasts forever. I wish they had candles in the Amazing Grace scent. I bought this as a birthday gift and they loved it.</li>
    <li> If you love Amazing Grace, or even if you don&#x27;t use it, you will love this whipped butter! Non greasy, it&#x27;s pure comfort and luxury with the wonderfully clean scent of Amazing Grace. I love it</li>
    <li> this cream is lightly scented and not overbearing...will be great for summer....goes on so smoothly and makes your skin very soft.</li>
    <li> This body creme is the best moisturizer ever.  It is the perfect consistency for applying to your body and your skin is still hydrated at the end of the day.  Could not ask for more.</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING!</li>
    <li> I love this body creme. It feels great and smells wonderful on the skin. Amazing Grace is my statement scent and this one is a keeper.</li>
    <li> I love this product and use it often, however, I received the Amazing Grace Body Butter instead of the Whipped Body Creme.  Thought I was getting a bargain, since ordering from Amazon was less expensive, but I will get it elsewhere in order to get the right product and not have to wait so long.</li>
    <li> Love Philosophy&#x27;s Amazing Grace products!  This is a great body crème and has a very nice, light fragrance.</li>
    <li> This is the best. It smell great and does a great job of moisturizing the skin. I use most of Philosophy products and my favorite scent is Amazing Grace.</li>
    <li> Smells so good and clean</li>
    <li> Absolutely love Amazing Grace! Always wanted a moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy, sticky feeling but yet does its job. Amazing Grace definitely did. It moisturizes and leaves ur skin smooth without that greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> Yummy, creamy and heavenly stuff.</li>
    <li> Best clean scent ever</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite ways to enjoy the Amazing Fragrance.  Feels great after a shower or just before bed.  Softens arms and legs and leaves a lingering fresh scent.</li>
    <li> i love this. the scent is GREAT it goes on so smooth and dissolves into the skin quickly.  DEFINITELY A KEEPER AND  i will purchase it again.  THANK YOU.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best body creme I have ever purchased. I have already bought it for my mom and my daughter. they love it also!</li>
    <li> so creamy and great scent love!</li>
    <li> I love this and use it everyday!!!</li>
    <li> Good they come today.  Smell ok.</li>
    <li> I L.OV.E Amazing Grace! This was sooooo much bigger than what I&#x27;ve seen in department stores. Please don&#x27;t ever run out I will be order more!</li>
    <li> I have always loved Philosophy&#x27;s Amazing Grace scent.  I was wanting a lightweight lotion and decided to try this, I&#x27;ve been very pleased.  It&#x27;s very light and absorbs nicely.</li>
    <li> delivered on time and the fragrance was good.  Not like Pure Grace.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is not the same as the lotion.</li>
    <li> The Philosophy Amazing Grace Whipped Body Creme was excellent. It met my expectations.</li>
    <li> Amazing Grace is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; cream and fragrance.  I love its delicate, feminine scent.  It is long-lasting, especially if you layer it -- shower gel, body creme, and spray.  I cannot count the times I&#x27;ve had strangers come up to me and tell me how good I smell.  My man will often pull me close just so he can inhale and sniff me!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a birthday gift for my mother, and I thought it smelled heavenly!  My mother also loved it!  The texture is very rich and creamy, comes in a nice elegant jar.  It smells amazingly clean, and the scent just gets nicer on your skin as the day goes on.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with the entire philosophy line so it should come as no surprise that I love this body cream. You only need a little and it smells sooooo good!!</li>
    <li> Love the scent...Doesn&#x27;t last very long even with layering the cream and parfum.  I love it tho.</li>
    <li> I love Philosophy and this creme really softens my skin better than the pump lotion.  It leaves my skin smooth and it smells wonderful without overpowering.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and really softens skin.</li>
    <li> i think the body creme is much better than lotion to use in winter.  this is nicely scented.</li>
    <li> Beautiful scent-feels lovely on your skin.  Great product.</li>
    <li> This was an original gift and I was impressed so, I purchased the body crème for myself.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this fragrance!! I will order again.</li>
    <li> Nothing smells better :)</li>
    <li> I love my amazing grace cream it&#x27;s just that amazing</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer, thick, but spreads easily with a great fragrance..very light and not over powering..would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Good scent but a little heavy (Thick) for my liking.</li>
    <li> My husband band HATED the fragrance and couldn&#x27;t return it. Money wasted.</li>
    <li> i chose this rating cause its an okay cream,, don&#x27;t really recommend it. the smell doesn&#x27;t stay it fades away fast.</li>
    <li> The whipped body creme feels silky and smooth.  I do wish the scent was stronger, so will purchase the perfume.</li>
    <li> Great product. Will order again.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my grandma, who is very picky regarding cosmetic products etc. She really loves it, says it has a light fragrance, and is not too heavy on the skin - as some lotions/ moisturizers can be.</li>
    <li> Love this body creme!  Feels and smells very nice.  Had to order more  after a friend gave me one for Christmas. Seller was right on the money with delivery, too.</li>
