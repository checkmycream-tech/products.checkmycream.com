      <li>The product, when &#x27;authentic&#x27; gets a million stars from me.</li>
      <li>How can you trust that an item is an authentic Kerastase product if it is unsealed.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is a great product and I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Kerastase is just the best product for long color treated hair.  </li>
      <li>(it is awesome for my very long hair)</li>
      <li>I have been using this product as conditioner for years, my hair has gotten so smooth, silky.</li>
      <li>masque (in general) was good or not, and since it shipped with amazon</li>

      <li>So yes, I need a good deep conditioner.  </li>
      <li>It is the only product that makes my hair look healthy.</li>
      <li>This time I decided to purchase a larger container hoping to get a better deal and savings but this item came without a box.</li>
      <li>I am a long time user of Kerastase oleo-relax which often it is a great product for dry or frizzy hair.</li>
      <li>Besides myself both of my daughter tried it to see if the result on their hair would be any different instead we were left with incredible frizzy and dried hair, confirming the fact that we were not dealing with the original Kerastase.</li>
      <li>So never having seen the large size Masque in any stores before, I jumped at the chance to purchase it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>any case, now having gone through the whole container.</li>
      <li>and I use so much of it.  </li>
      <li>Note that I bought the 500ml one from Amazon and am comparing it to the 200ml ones from department stores, which are much thicker and the product comes sealed.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s the real deal if it comes sealed.</li>

      <li>I finally decided I was going to have to go get it cut significantly shorter because it was so unmanageable and had lost a of of shine and was frizzy.</li>
      <li>From the VERY FIRST WASH I IMMEDIATELY noticed a change in my hair back to how it used to be (when using &#x27;real&#x27; product).  </li>
      <li>This large container makes it easy to put your fingers in and gather enough product to work a section of hair without getting it outside the container.</li>

      <li>Due to the watery nature of the 500ml one from Amazon, it required using more of the product to have any of the results I&#x27;ve come to expect from the typical Oleo Relax</li>
      <li>I guess in hindsight, since Amazon was shipping it, that also seemed to give a certain sense of security overall in the back of my mind as a purchase in general (like having a big name you trust).  </li>
      <li>I can say that whether it&#x27;s real or not, the 500ml one from Amazon only lasted just as long as the 200ml one from stores.</li>
      <li>The additional seal that comes with the usual Kerastase was missing.&lt;br /&gt;The product does not smell similar to the original Kerastase oleo-relax.</li>
      <li>I recently bought the smaller size directly from Kerastase and found the quality to be what I am use to.</li>
      <li>I remembered my little nagging concerns about the product when I had first gotten it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been a user of Oleo Relax for years. Recently I have been buying the 16.7 oz. This size is a different product then the smaller container. I have bought from several venders and consistantly found that product is watery. I recently bought the smaller size directly from Kerastase and found the quality to be what I am use to. I would no recommend the larger size.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product as conditioner for years, my hair has gotten so smooth, silky. This bottle lasts for a year, great value for the money I paid.</li>
    <li> This is a great conditioner! This large container makes it easy to put your fingers in and gather enough product to work a section of hair without getting it outside the container. Price and delivery are great.</li>
    <li> Great for dry curly hair</li>
    <li> It is difficult to find this product in the large size.  I have very thick, coarse, naturally blonde hair, and live in a  high humidity city.  It is the only product that makes my hair look healthy.</li>
    <li> It was not like the one I brought from  France,</li>
    <li> The product, when &#x27;authentic&#x27; gets a million stars from me. It has literally transformed my hair and enabled me to grow it past my waist by keeping the frizz down and maintaining moisture/conditioning in the ends for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review however is one star because my two jar purchase was not good product.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased two of the large jars (16.9) in November of 2013 as I use this product daily (it is awesome for my very long hair) and so it is costly to purchase full price the small jars as I use so much.  As I already knew the product works wonders on my hair I didn&#x27;t even bother to read the reviews on the product as I assumed they would just be reviews as to whether kerastase oleo relax masque (in general) was good or not, and since it shipped with amazon I didn&#x27;t worry about looking for reviews with regards to shipping issues. I guess in hindsight, since Amazon was shipping it, that also seemed to give a certain sense of security overall in the back of my mind as a purchase in general (like having a big name you trust).  As I read the reviews now after the fact I now see that others have had similar non-authentic issues as I did.&lt;br /&gt;When the product arrived, the product jar looked normal down to every small letter and symbol. The product itself (consistency, etc) appeared similar to the usual product, although the color may have been very slightly off (which I would have not really noticed or would just have attributed to different batches).  I did notice right away upon opening that the perfumed SCENT was very (flowery) strong and definitely not the usual scent (this was actually what prompted me to check the jar markings side by side with the jar that I was finishing up and already knew worked because of the difference it makes in my hair - I HAVE to use this product every time or wash or my hair doesn&#x27;t do well).  I then immediately opened the second jar and the perfumed scent was again not the usual scent, and was even a different scent even from the first (what ended up being &#x27;fake&#x27;)  jar I had just opened.  In my mind at the time I did wonder why, but decided since all of them were different, it must just be different batches, or perhaps a change in scent formulation since the packages looked the same and the consistency etc was the same as usual.&lt;br /&gt;I then forgot in my mind about the noticeable scent issues and the nag in the back of my mind that something didn&#x27;t seem right.  I went to using the new product jar when what I already had ran out. Gradually my hair was getting worse and worse and not doing well.  I couldn&#x27;t figure out what was going on with my hair.  This went on for WEEKS.  I finally decided I was going to have to go get it cut significantly shorter because it was so unmanageable and had lost a of of shine and was frizzy. :(&lt;br /&gt;Then one day it hit me.  I remembered my little nagging concerns about the product when I had first gotten it. The first thing I did was I changed to/began using the second jar that I had purchased at the same time as the first (that had also smelled different from the authentic product I had before purchasing these jars, but had also smelled different from the first jar of bad product [so I was hoping maybe the first one was just one bad expired jar or something]).  I noticed no difference/improvement with the second jar, so I decided to invest in one last ditch experiment before I hacked my hair off because I was incredibly sad that I was going to have to do that. I took a trip to one of the &#x27;authorized&#x27; kerastase salons (I got the place off the kerastase website) and purchased the &#x27;small&#x27; (&#x27;normal&#x27;) sized container of the product.  I began to use it the next day.  From the VERY FIRST WASH I IMMEDIATELY noticed a change in my hair back to how it used to be (when using &#x27;real&#x27; product).  Immediate. It was a miracle. With continued use my hair continued to improve and I am so incredibly happy to say I didn&#x27;t end up having to cut it!! :)  I am absolutely without asingle doubt in my mind positive that the two 16.9 oz jars I had purchased were fake or expired (I put my money on fake).  This is upsetting to me because this product is so expensive and I use so much of it.  Right now I am about to start my second small jar from the &#x27;authorized&#x27; salon. I am not sure what I am going to do purchasing wise in the future.  I am afraid right now to purchase from an &#x27;unauthorized&#x27; dealer now because of my experience but I am hoping that I can find another source with good reviews that I can work up the courage to try. I believe based on other reviews I will likely (if I try &#x27;nonauthorized&#x27; in the future) stick with the smaller jars which come in sealed packages.&lt;br /&gt;I will say also that my friend (who originally turned me on to this product) also purchased the large jar from amazon from same seller.  When I FYIed her about what had transpired, she texted me later saying that she had gone back and read reviews and that some reviewers had concerns about fake product. She said she had noticed her hair didn&#x27;t do as well with the product (she only uses it very occasionally after surfing) and so she decided to go to an authorized salon (she went to a different one) and purchase a small jar and she said she had a noticeable difference when she used the &#x27;authorized retailer&#x27; one so she also reports hers was fake/expired.&lt;br /&gt;So to sum up ... three 16.9 oz jars, two people. Three bad jars (all of them the 16.9 ounce). :(single doubt in my mind positive that the two 16.9 oz jars I had purchased were fake or expired (I put my money on fake).

    <li> I am a long time user of Kerastase oleo-relax which often it is a great product for dry or frizzy hair. It is an expensive item but it is worth due to the great result. This time I decided to purchase a larger container hoping to get a better deal and savings but this item came without a box. It was wrapped in plastic wrap instead of a manufacturer wrapping. The additional seal that comes with the usual Kerastase was missing.&lt;br /&gt;The product does not smell similar to the original Kerastase oleo-relax. It did not have the same texture and furthermore it did provide the same result that Kerastase product always deliver. Besides myself both of my daughter tried it to see if the result on their hair would be any different instead we were left with incredible frizzy and dried hair, confirming the fact that we were not dealing with the original Kerastase. I am disappointed and furious to have trusted this distributor and to have been taken advantage of.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff for my curly hair!  Been using it for years now and swear by it.</li>
    <li> So never having seen the large size Masque in any stores before, I jumped at the chance to purchase it on Amazon. Like other reviewers have mentioned, the item was not sealed as Loreal products usually are. And the consistency of the masque was much more watery than I&#x27;ve found in the past with the regular 200ml size ones from stores. Note that I bought the 500ml one from Amazon and am comparing it to the 200ml ones from department stores, which are much thicker and the product comes sealed. So it&#x27;s possible that the 200ml one from Amazon is the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, now having gone through the whole container. I can say that whether it&#x27;s real or not, the 500ml one from Amazon only lasted just as long as the 200ml one from stores. Due to the watery nature of the 500ml one from Amazon, it required using more of the product to have any of the results I&#x27;ve come to expect from the typical Oleo Relax Masque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a great product and I highly recommend it. My only caveat is to AVOID the 500ml one like the plague and instead buy the 200ml one and even then only trust it&#x27;s the real deal if it comes sealed.</li>
    <li> Kerastase is just the best product for long color treated hair.  I live at the beach and have highlights, and use a blowdryer and a straightener.  So yes, I need a good deep conditioner.  I recently tried less expensive products and the Morrocan Oil line.  Then I came back to Kerastase Nutritive Oleo Relax line.  Ahhhhhh.  Such a difference.  Spend the money - you will see what I am talking about.  Softer hair, less frizz.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying that i have extremely thick hair , very voluminous... So i was looking for a conditioner that wouldn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, make it greasy and knotty! This tames my frizziness and also acts as a detangler. This is a staple in my hair care regimen!</li>
    <li> This mask leaves my hair soft and manageable ! The mask and the shampoo make my hair look gorgeous.</li>
    <li> Great product, love the way my hair feels !!</li>
    <li> The product arrived in a timely fashion however; the lid was wrapped with tape and it di not have the white cover under the lid as usual.  The product doesn&#x27;t feel as thick as usual.</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner kerastase makes. I recommend this product!!! This is great for curly or frizzy hair. expensive but worth the cost.</li>
    <li> This product, Nutritive Oleo Relax Masque Unisex Hair Mask by Kerastase, 16.7 Ounce, do not good for my hair, I usually  use  Kerastase Nutritive Oleo-Relax Smoothing Mask ( Dry &amp; Rebellious Hair ) - Kerastase - Nutritive - 500ml/16.7oz</li>
    <li> I use this mask as my everyday conditioner because it makes my hair so soft and shiny.  It&#x27;s expensive, but it works.</li>
    <li> This item was shipped unsealed. How can you trust that an item is an authentic Kerastase product if it is unsealed.</li>
