<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I am happy with this purchase, it works as well as the brand that is sold with the MIA and I don&#x27;t see any difference.  I will definitely purchase same in the future and have already told my friends about this brand.  It is very gentle yet cleanses very well, my skin is very sensitive  and I get no irritation using this brand.  Shipping was very fast.</li>
    <li> So far, so good. It fits my clarasonic and it works.</li>
    <li> Never buying the expensive heads again, these are perfect</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t work as well as I would have hoped. They pop off from my clarisonic.</li>
    <li> As a value shopper,  I really wanted these to be good.  I tried using this brush head for several months.  Every time I try to turn it on, the head does not operate.  If I try to turn it on repeated, occasionally it will turn on the third time.  If it doesn&#x27;t, then I need to remove the head and try to reseat it. There must be something about the design that is slightly off the OEM heads as when I put the old OEM head back on it turns on the first try.  More recently the head developed a moldy/bacteria type smell.  I had to use hydrogen peroxide to disinfect .  I never had that problem with the OEM head.  As they say, &amp;#34;you get what you pay for.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I never knew you could buy generic Mia2 heads! I am so happy I found these and the brushes fit perfectly on a Clarsonic Mia2. I am never going back to name-brand brushes again!</li>
    <li> Great quality, awesome price, and I will be a lifetime customer. These replacement brushes fit perfectly in my MIA 1.</li>
    <li> Excellent brushes, the price point allows our family of 4 clarisonics to have refreshed clean brushes on schedule.  We have found no difference in the quality or performance.</li>
    <li> Work great! And such a good price.</li>
    <li> Great replacement brush,  exactly the same as the more expensive &amp;#34;name&amp;#34; brand.</li>
    <li> I tried the Deep Pore option from this line in the hopes that it would replace my expensive clarisonic refills in the deep pore option. These are fantastic! They are incredibly soft and do a fantastic job of cleaning my skin :) They fit my clarisonic perfectly and I could not be more pleased! These will be my go to from now on!!! I highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> No different than the original brush head. I&#x27;ll always reorder.</li>
    <li> Did NOT fit my Mia 2. Not compatible. Waste of time/money.</li>
    <li> Product arrived very quickly and works as well as the name brand brushes on my device, will purchase again</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> One of them didn&#x27;t spin when put onto my Clarsonic.</li>
    <li> Great brushes At a great price!</li>
    <li> I received the product when promised, but have not yet put the replacement heads on my Mia 2.............Dont need to replace it yet, but the new heads are ready and waiting.  I will update when I have actually used the product.</li>
    <li> Great product for half the price as a Clarisonic. Fits perfectly and works as expected.</li>
    <li> My order for the replacement heads for my  Mia works great.  I will surely reorder from you for these replacement heads.</li>
    <li> These fit perfectly on my clarisonic.  They seem to work just as well as the brand name ones, and are waaaay cheaper.  I will definitely buy them again.</li>
    <li> These brush heads are awesome! Do NOT pay full price for original manufacturer heads. The bristles feel just like the original, fit perfectly, and are very soft.  I highly recommend these heads and this company.</li>
    <li> These are a perfect fit on my clarisonic mia. The price can&#x27;t be beat and they work just as good as the clarisonic brush heads.</li>
    <li> stick with the brand name the generics are nothing like the original</li>
    <li> used these last night when they arrived. They fit right into my Mia and the brush is so much better than the original. I&#x27;m glad i bought these and not the expensive ones that aren&#x27;t generic. Much better deal and my face feels really clean again.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had any issues and saved a lot of money!</li>
    <li> These were terrific brush heads and worked perfectly.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great - they fit my Clarisonic Mia 2 just like the original Clarisonic brushes, but at a fraction of the cost.  Would definitey purchase again.</li>
    <li> great!! The brushes are a value compared to the originals! Fast delivery too.</li>
    <li> Fit my Clarisonic Mia perfectly and I use them every day.</li>
    <li> Excellent value. Brush heads are soft and great for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Fits on my Mia 2 and works great. Will definitely get these again instead of very expensive manufacturer&#x27;s brush heads.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with the brushes and shipping time . I would highly recommend the purchase of these brushes from this company.</li>
    <li> From as far as I can tell these are no different than the clairsonic brand. I have ordered the more expensive clairsonic brand far the past couple years. This is my first off-label purchase. I received them and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> Fast service, great price. Pretty happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a great affordable alternative to the name brand clarisonic brush heads. They are not an exact dupe since I find these are softer than the name brand and more gentle on the skin which is great for those with sensitive skin. Mine fits perfect and I haven&#x27;t noticed any shedding. I have the one for acne prone skin and am considering the deep pore one for something a little more abrasive. But I still love the softness of mine for everyday use</li>
    <li> I have used the clarisonic brush heads for awhile and I ordered these out of curiosity. Well... What a great surprise!  Works great for Mia and feels great too.  Will reorder</li>
    <li> Very impressed with the quality and could not tell a difference from the Clarisonic brush heads. I had been dreading buying replacements but am glad I have found a much cheaper alternative that works just like the real thing!</li>
    <li> As advertised, the brushes are softer than the original. However, my face actually appreciated the extra softness and my acne has started to clear up! win, win.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m confused by the reviews on these.  I didn&#x27;t think that these worked at all.  I put them in my clarisonic and they didn&#x27;t even vibrate.  It would be like if I just took a brush and rubbed it against my face instead of letting the machine do the work.  Now, I only buy the clarisonic heads because I&#x27;m scared to try a generic brand again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not compatible with Clarisonic. The middle part of the brush head doesn&#x27;t move. Waste of money and time!!!</li>
    <li> Let me just say these are pretty much the exact same as the clarisonic brush heads if not better. They fit perfectly also, can&#x27;t tel the difference. I was so happy when I heard about these, because who doesn&#x27;t want to save money and have an awesome product. You definitely won&#x27;t regret it if you by them.!!</li>
