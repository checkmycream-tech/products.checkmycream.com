      <li>VERY PLEASED-WORKS GREAT</li>
      <li>Perfect for my short hair and taking care of my scalp.</li>
      <li>/&gt;People have knocked on the bathroom door asking if I was okay, because I was moaning in the bathtub while using this.</li>
      <li>Easy to use, fits comfortably over the hand.</li>
      <li>This little item works wonderfully!</li>
      <li>Free scalp massage is a bonus.</li>
      <li>But I would still recommend it to anyone that wants to wash their hair and give it a nice message without using your fingers.</li>
      <li>Quality material, it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
      <li>far superior to anything from the drug store</li>
      <li>Quick and easy washing and conditioning.</li>
      <li>My scalp feels really clean afterwards and it</li>
      <li>, quickly tried it, seems to do the job efficiently.</li>
      <li>It made my scalp feel like it was really clean and clear, thanks!!</li>
      <li>As someone who consistently had dandruff problems for over a decade, this was a game-changer.</li>
      <li>Only issue is the handle, I think it could have been made to be more smooth or soft (somehow).</li>
      <li>So I typed into amazon and there were so many different ones.</li>
      <li>It works up a luxurious lather and just plain feels good.</li>
      <li>I have natural hair and have been natural for 6 years, and this is the first time my scalp has been squeaky clean!</li>
      <li>I decided to go with the Denman be-bop message brush simply because I was familiar with the brand and Denman usually makes good stuff.</li>
      <li>I can really feel the blood flow circulating to the surfaces when I use this.</li>
      <li>and I massage my whole head.</li>
      <li>Really exfoliates and massaged my scalp.</li>
      <li>Gentle on the skin and leaves no scratches or breaks.</li>
      <li>My husband finds his to be very relaxing as well.</li>
      <li>Much quicker delivery than estimated.  </li>
      <li>I was so excited to find these since my daughter has regular build-up on her scalp from hair products.  </li>
      <li>Does not tangle my long fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
      <li>Now I&#x27;m able to cut down on my shampoo time using this brush.</li>
      <li>good palm brush  wish it was a little bigger</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different types of anti-dandruff shampoos but they won&#x27;t work effectively if there&#x27;s no good way to massage them directly into the scalp.</li>
      <li>, it glides easily on your hair and the plastic material is fantastic, not too soft not too hard</li>
      <li>But for normal use all I can say is &amp;#34;Ahhhhhhhh&amp;#34;,</li>
      <li>bit small but works fine!</li>
      <li>it would have been nice to say that I keep the grey one in the shower and the black in my hair styling bag.</li>
      <li>So far since getting it I have used it a few times and I must say it actually feels nice on the scalp.</li>
      <li>The only area I massage somewhat gently is the temples as it feels sensitive there.</li>
      <li>I like the soft bristles that invigorate and massage the scalp.  </li>
      <li>It really works my curl cleanser in and get my scalp squeaky clean and removes all buildup and flakey skin without my hands and arms getting tired from doing all the work.</li>
      <li>Only problem was the brush is a tad small for my big fingers to fit in, but I made it work.</li>
      <li>Part of the problem seemed to be that I have really thick hair and never felt like I was getting my scalp properly clean.</li>
      <li>I use it to brush my curls every few days too, and it works even better than my tangle teaser with less damage and discomfort!</li>
      <li>The bristles are not long enough.</li>
      <li>For those with short and long hair, and thin or thick hair because bristles aren&#x27;t short and also not too soft or hard, just perfect in my opinion.</li>

<li> Heavy duty brush.</li>
<li> What else do you want for a few bucks?</li>
<li> My only disappointment was that I though that I would be sent a black and a grey one as shown in the picture</li>
<li> No more dropping my brush, comb or tangle teezer and 1000 times.  </li>
<li> hard plastic</li>
<li> Hard to find these shampoo brushes.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using the Denman shampoo brush for at least 25 years.  </li>

    <li> Heavy duty brush. Does what it supposed to do.</li>
    <li> I have natural hair and have been natural for 6 years, and this is the first time my scalp has been squeaky clean! I&#x27;ve always had to scrub hard with my fingers because my hair is so thick and coarse (I have type 4c natural hair), and I wouldn&#x27;t be able to fully clean my scalp because my arms would be tired. Now I&#x27;m able to cut down on my shampoo time using this brush.</li>
    <li> Hard to find these shampoo brushes.  Really great for scalp massage in shower to decrease dandruff.</li>
    <li> I love this brush!  I use it for both shampooing and styling my hair in a pony tail.  It smothers the hair nicely. The bristles feels so good on the scalp.  When used to style my hair instead of using a comb or tangle teezer brush I use this and I&#x27;m able to finish doing my hair in no time, one of the reasons is that you have a perfect grip of the brush. No more dropping my brush, comb or tangle teezer and 1000 times.  My only disappointment was that I though that I would be sent a black and a grey one as shown in the picture but I got two black ones.  it would have been nice to say that I keep the grey one in the shower and the black in my hair styling bag. Anyhow it not a big deal.  I would but it again.</li>
    <li> Very nice and sturdy. Really exfoliates and massaged my scalp. I love it! I can really feel the blood flow circulating to the surfaces when I use this. My husband finds his to be very relaxing as well.</li>
    <li> My family, friends and I love this brush!!!!!</li>
    <li> My mom scrubbed the heck out of my scalp when I was a kid, and I hated it! But 60 years later I was longing fir the stimulation and means to get rid of any oily build-up on my scalp. This little item works wonderfully! It wouldn&#x27;t take a ton of pressure or the handle would possibly detach. But for normal use all I can say is &amp;#34;Ahhhhhhhh&amp;#34;,</li>
    <li> bit small but works fine!</li>
    <li> Perfect for scalp massage, shampooing and conditioning for all family members. Does not tangle my long fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;You can even use one for your pet.</li>
    <li> Love it, just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> far superior to anything from the drug store</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It made my scalp feel like it was really clean and clear, thanks!! Only problem was the brush is a tad small for my big fingers to fit in, but I made it work.</li>
    <li> This brush is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use one for my 2yo daughter and one for myself. With curly hair, I get a lot of product buildup. This brush scrubs the scalp and removes all of that.</li>
    <li> Massager for itchy scalp and skin. Easy to use, fits comfortably over the hand. Durable, tines don&#x27;t bend or beak. Gentle on the skin and leaves no scratches or breaks. Have purchased 4-5 to always have one handy.</li>
    <li> Best comb out there in the market right now, it glides easily on your hair and the plastic material is fantastic, not too soft not too hard</li>
    <li> saves my nails.  feels good on my scalp</li>
    <li> Good product, quick delivery</li>
    <li> Great amazing cant shampoo without these!! These are more durable and bristles are longer than competitors</li>
    <li> Love this brush! My husband has been looking for thses for years and I&#x27;m so happy i was able to locate them.  He said that these brushes are the best he has ever used.</li>
    <li> good palm brush  wish it was a little bigger</li>
    <li> Quick and easy washing and conditioning. Free scalp massage is a bonus. What else do you want for a few bucks?</li>
    <li> I have really thick hair, and my scalp is... finicky? It gets scaly and I have a tendency to pick at it- very bad nervous habit- which just keeps it in an endless cycle to irritation and discomfort. Part of the problem seemed to be that I have really thick hair and never felt like I was getting my scalp properly clean. This works so well. It really works my curl cleanser in and get my scalp squeaky clean and removes all buildup and flakey skin without my hands and arms getting tired from doing all the work. It also works my oil treatment into the scalp nicely. I use it to brush my curls every few days too, and it works even better than my tangle teaser with less damage and discomfort!</li>
    <li> VERY PLEASED-WORKS GREAT</li>
    <li> if you have long hair it will catch on the handle</li>
    <li> Honestly, I purchased these items to avoid paying shipping.  But when I used them, I could feel residual scalp tingling for almost 15 minutes after use.  I&#x27;m hopeful that they will simulate my scalp and yield results.</li>
    <li> Awesome massaging brushes!&lt;br /&gt;Great for the whole family! For those with short and long hair, and thin or thick hair because bristles aren&#x27;t short and also not too soft or hard, just perfect in my opinion. Thank you Denman!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to find these since my daughter has regular build-up on her scalp from hair products.  (She is bi-racial and has very thick curly hair.)  She loved the feel of these bristles while shampooing, and it did the job.....until the handle broke the second time we used it!</li>
    <li> replaced and existing one that failed after decades of use.  Was happy to be able to find a replacement and this supplier had by far the best price.</li>
    <li> The bristles are not long enough.</li>
    <li> the brushes are about the size of our palms, the handle gives you a perfect grip and full control of the brush. it&#x27;s sturdy, strong and is perfect for getting to your scalp. Great quality and well worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Denman shampoo brush for at least 25 years.  Over time I&#x27;ve lost them, leaving them behind at hotels (always check the shower) and friend&#x27;s  homes, and have needed replacements.  It works up a luxurious lather and just plain feels good.</li>
    <li> Faster than expected delivery (1.5 weeks). The bristles are the perfect stiffness for most of my head. The only area I massage somewhat gently is the temples as it feels sensitive there. I use it everytime I shower and I honestly thought it was going to pull out my hair or make it fall out but after a while of using it, I feel like less hair is falling out when I shampoo. Only issue is the handle, I think it could have been made to be more smooth or soft (somehow). My two fingers start to hurt a little when slipped in the handle and I massage my whole head. Otherwise, this is a great and well-made brush.</li>
    <li> Great brush. I keep one in my locker at work and when I travel. Good product</li>
    <li> I like the soft bristles that invigorate and massage the scalp.  I have not had a problem with the handle as previously noted on the ratings.</li>
    <li> Arrive soon. Brush is in proper hardness so that I don&#x27;t feel pain in my scalp. I use it every time with shampoo.</li>
    <li> hard plastic - I expected there to be some give in the prongs.  I can&#x27;t use it on my long hair.  I guess it would feel nice on a guys head</li>
    <li> Hair does not feel the same without this!</li>
    <li> Just arrived, quickly tried it, seems to do the job efficiently.</li>
    <li> &amp;#60;3 these! Perfect for my short hair and taking care of my scalp.</li>
    <li> As someone who consistently had dandruff problems for over a decade, this was a game-changer. I&#x27;ve tried many different types of anti-dandruff shampoos but they won&#x27;t work effectively if there&#x27;s no good way to massage them directly into the scalp. Enter this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People have knocked on the bathroom door asking if I was okay, because I was moaning in the bathtub while using this.</li>
    <li> I was watching a video on youtube and I heard a person talking about message brushes and how they are good for your hair and scalp etc. So I decided to watch other videos and listen to other persons opinions about the product. So after I thought I had obtained enough information as possible I decide to buy one. So I typed into amazon and there were so many different ones. I decided to go with the Denman be-bop message brush simply because I was familiar with the brand and Denman usually makes good stuff. So far since getting it I have used it a few times and I must say it actually feels nice on the scalp. When I am shampooing my hair i use it to message the product into my scalp. My scalp feels really clean afterwards and it like I said before you get a nice feeling on your scalp. I wouldn&#x27;t say to anyone that this item is a must have. But I would still recommend it to anyone that wants to wash their hair and give it a nice message without using your fingers.</li>
    <li> Good:  Quality material, it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap. I use one in the shower to scrub my scalp, and the other, as a brush when getting my GQ on.    Bad:  None to date.    Recommended?  Yes.</li>
    <li> Much quicker delivery than estimated.  Good size and seems well built.</li>
    <li> I KEPT ONE AND GAVE ONE AWAY</li>
