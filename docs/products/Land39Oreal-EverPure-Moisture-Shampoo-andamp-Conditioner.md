      <li>It had great reviews, for the most part.</li>

      <li>my hair has never looked better!</li>
      <li>I LOVE this stuff!</li>
      <li>The conditioner is amazing as well...</li>
      <li>The scent of the shampoo is nice too and lingers in your hair after your shower.</li>
      <li>It made my hair so soft and wonderful</li>
      <li>This is by far the best I&#x27;ve seen for my money.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t even know if I needed it, since I could tell that my hair was doing wonderfully just with the regular conditioner alone.</li>
      <li>but I find it incredibly refreshing.</li>
      <li>Ok, I&#x27;ve been dying my hair since I was 15...</li>
      <li>I happen to love this shampoo and conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This has become a pet peeve of mine with most health and beauty products.  </li>
      <li>cause I&#x27;m always touching my hair after I use it.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
      <li>&#x27;s why I love these products:&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many things to help my dyed hair...</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
      <li>I expect more durable packaging.</li>
      <li>The manufacturers can do better.</li>
      <li>I love the product for my color treated hair.  </li>
      <li>, I love it.  </li>
      <li>Sure they worked, but so does L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
      <li>my husband and I love the smell .</li>
      <li>I am in love with these products.</li>
      <li>Color is holding up better, longer and my scalp feels better.  </li>
      <li>In fact, I fell in love with the minty/rosemary/juniper smell, but then I love those scents.</li>
      <li>I too am bothered by alot of scents, but this one is ok for me.</li>
      <li>It is not heavy and the conditioner works great.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t have a sensitive nose, and aren&#x27;t prone to migraines, this is a great buy.</li>
      <li>Not to mention smells so strong it receives complaints....</li>
      <li>However while using it the smell was so strong it tingled my nose.</li>
      <li>The price for a good quality, high performance product is unbeatable.</li>
      <li>They are gentle on my color-treated hair and leave it silky and shiny; very elegant and pleasing to use.</li>
      <li>My hair and scalp feel clean, and my hair smells great and is soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>Since I have fine hair, I don&#x27;t use the conditioner every time I shampoo, but about once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have lots of fine color-treated hair, and like the performance of sulfate free products, but not the price.  </li>
      <li>The light scent stays on my hair all day.  </li>
      <li>The conditioner leaves my hair so smooth and silky.  </li>
      <li>I decided to switch to a sulfate free shampoo.</li>
      <li>The biggest plus is it absolutely extends the length of your hair color!!!</li>
      <li>I was excited to try this.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a trade-off between preserving one&#x27;s hair color and having one&#x27;s hair squeaky clean.</li>
      <li>nothing terribly special, but they do the job.</li>
      <li>Sulfate free and specializing in moisture, which is exactly what I was looking for!</li>
      <li>I actually love the smell, it reminds me in scent and intensity of Aveda rosemary-mint product line - personally, it&#x27;s one of my favorite things about the product, but if you like fragrance free products, it may not be for you.  </li>
      <li>My hair is highlighted and it stays looking good for several months if I use this shampoo.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love it so much, in fact, that I think I&#x27;ll pick up the EverPure leave-in conditioner</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;ll get its full results.</li>
      <li>As far as shampoos and conditioners go, these are nice products...</li>
      <li>It does however have a very strong smell, but it leaves my hair feeling soft and nourished.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with this product overall.</li>
      <li>The first thing I did was hopped online and started looking up the best shampoos and conditioners for African American, type 4a hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very thick but doesn&#x27;t leave any impressive shine or softness.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried the Fructis oil shampoo, tresemme smooth and silky, Aussie Hair repair, Philosophy hair repair conditioner... about a million things within a reasonable price range.  </li>
      <li>My boyfriend makes fun of me</li>
      <li>Completely aside from the sulfate-free issue, I love this shampoo/conditioner.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not easy to find sulfate-free products, so I was really happy when I heard about these.</li>
      <li>When I first smelled the bottle I liked it, a little too flowery for my taste (I prefer fruity smells) but not terrible.</li>
      <li>This is is just right and</li>
      <li>I think they should use a better natural scent that leaves the hair smelling pretty.</li>
      <li>This shampoo and conditioner feels great on the hair, but I&#x27;d have to agree with the previous review about the smell being a bit much.</li>
      <li>It was so strong, I was debating washing my hair again with my old shampoo &amp; conditioner right after I got out of the shower.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve decided to start maintaining my hair on my own, and visiting my stylist for trims any other necessary maintenance that I can&#x27;t do on my own.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair nice &amp; soft, but it smells strongly of old lady perfume.</li>
      <li>This combo keeps my easily weighed down hair shiny, healthy and bouncy.  </li>
      <li>plan to keep using this stuff, really like it!</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think much of it at first.</li>
      <li>I have normal to fine hair and most moisturizing products are too heavy.  </li>
      <li>I had two different co-workers try and figure out what the strong perfume-like chemical smell was</li>
      <li>There have been a lot of comments on the strong smell, but I like the smell, so it is a personal preference.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only been using the shampoo and conditioner for a week or so, but I already notice a huge difference in my hair.</li>
      <li>it really does moisturize, and I don&#x27;t have to use a lot of it to spread it amongst my hair.</li>
      <li>My hair had so much shine, and bounce.</li>
      <li>I will buy again, but really wish they would change the scent - or make it unscented.  </li>
      <li>, I tried this whole line, every bit of it.</li>
      <li>Phosphate-free shampoos are very pricey in a salon -</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really know if it works well or not because I won&#x27;t be using it again.</li>
      <li>to mention how much cheaper it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different products for dyed hair, and this one is by far my favorite.</li>
      <li>Ranging from Pantene to Aveda, none of them have ever left my hair feeling and looking as soft and healthy as this product.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love the product for my color treated hair.  However, I hate the packaging.  Once you get down to the end of it,you can tell there is quite a bit of product left, but impossible to get out with cutting open the tube.  This has become a pet peeve of mine with most health and beauty products.  The manufacturers can do better.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair nice &amp; soft, but it smells strongly of old lady perfume. It was so strong, I was debating washing my hair again with my old shampoo &amp; conditioner right after I got out of the shower.</li>
    <li> I think this shampoo&amp; conditioner smells great, it&#x27;s not strong,and it smells nice on your hair afterwards. Still had flyaways though. Mrs. Wm Mitchell.</li>
    <li> I received the shampoo and conditioner as a sample. I have hard water and often the color care shampoos don&#x27;t lather. This product did, and my hair felt soft while wet, not tangled. I am a migraineur myself, but didn&#x27;t find the scent overpowering. In fact, I fell in love with the minty/rosemary/juniper smell, but then I love those scents. I think if you rinse your hair well, the scent may not be as overpowering afterward. I highly recommend these products. My hair and scalp feel clean, and my hair smells great and is soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> As advertised...no problem.</li>
    <li> Completely aside from the sulfate-free issue, I love this shampoo/conditioner. They are gentle on my color-treated hair and leave it silky and shiny; very elegant and pleasing to use. Unlike the first reviewer, I did not find the scent overpowering at all - they are much less scented than your average perfume-y shampoo, either salon or over-the-counter. The natural botanical scents of the rosemary and mint are very soothing.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not easy to find sulfate-free products, so I was really happy when I heard about these. As far as shampoos and conditioners go, these are nice products... nothing terribly special, but they do the job. The one thing you really need to know about these is that they are heavily scented. And I mean HEAVILY scented. The shampoo is rosemary juniper and the conditioner is rosemary mint. I like these scents, but sheesh, they are so overpowering. Once you rinse them out you can breathe again. If you are really sensitive to these scents, then you probably should stay away from these products.</li>
    <li> I had a hair stylist recommend this shampoo to me after I had my hair colored. It really does help the color last longer than shampoos that contain sulfate. I&#x27;m not sure how it works with other shades, but with the red and auburn shades I&#x27;ve had for the past few years the shampoo and conditioner work great. The scent of the shampoo is nice too and lingers in your hair after your shower. Just remember to leave the conditioner in a your hair for a few minutes and you&#x27;ll get its full results.</li>
    <li> I am in love with these products. I&#x27;ve only used these twice and have noticed an instant improvement in the texture of my hair. Naturally I have  thick, dry, coarse, curly hair that I blow dry, flat iron, and color. I&#x27;ve damaged the heck out of it. So I&#x27;m not used to running my fingers through silky soft strands but this system totally gave me that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell might be a tad masculine to some but I find it incredibly refreshing. It is strongly scented when your hair is wet but the scent fades gradually when air dried or blown straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish the bottles were bigger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the quality of the products, I definitely think the price is reasonable. Normally I&#x27;d have to spend thirty or forty dollars on a system that had the same effect. Think: Pureology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product to anyone with dry, color treated hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many things to help my dyed hair... its so dry, and frizzy!  I&#x27;ve tried the Fructis oil shampoo, tresemme smooth and silky, Aussie Hair repair, Philosophy hair repair conditioner... about a million things within a reasonable price range.  This is by far the best I&#x27;ve seen for my money.  It made my hair so soft and wonderful, I love it.  The scent is amazing as well!  Its all around a great product.</li>
    <li> Good shampoo.  Phosphate-free shampoos are very pricey in a salon - so the under $10.00 each price is terrific.  If you get a Brazilian Blowout or Keratin Complex treatment on you hair you need a no phosphate shampoo regimen afterwords.&lt;br /&gt;L&#x27;Oreal has the right product with a great scent and works great!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the shampoo and conditioner for a week or so, but I already notice a huge difference in my hair. My hair is very damaged from coloring over the years and it feel much less stressed. I also have been using the deep conditioning mask which has been very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to keep using this stuff, really like it!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner.  I like the smell and it does not weigh down my hair.  I have normal to fine hair and most moisturizing products are too heavy.  This is is just right and the price is great.  I usually use salon products that cost a fortune...no need any more.[[ASIN:B001P1ZELS L&#x27;Oreal Paris EverPure Moisture Shampoo, 8.5-Fluid Ounce]]</li>
    <li> Ok, I&#x27;ve been dying my hair since I was 15...and now I&#x27;m 27 so my hair has been over processed just a bit. I am a big fan of garnier fructis produts and that is what I had been using. I was at Walmart and saw these at $5.97 per tube and I was like oh well, it can&#x27;t hurt to try something different. Well, I&#x27;m glad I did!! my hair has never looked better! It flows and feels bouncy and vibrant. Love, love, love these products!!! :D</li>
    <li> I have used countless hair products on my hair extensions over the years. Ranging from Pantene to Aveda, none of them have ever left my hair feeling and looking as soft and healthy as this product.  Hair extensions naturally become dry over time but this product keeps the hair shiny and healthy. Would recommend to anyone with or without extensions!</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner feels great on the hair, but I&#x27;d have to agree with the previous review about the smell being a bit much. If you don&#x27;t have a sensitive nose, and aren&#x27;t prone to migraines, this is a great buy.</li>
    <li> I have color treated hair and use a flat iron daily.  My hair was dry and damaged.  After two weeks using this product my hairdresser asked me what I had done - my hair looked and felt so much better!  Great product - four stars because I do not like the manly smell.  Not one for perfume likes smells either-would rather just a neutral \\&quot;clean\\&quot; smell.  I will buy again, but really wish they would change the scent - or make it unscented.  Other than the scent this is a great product, and worked wonders on my hair. Used the shampoo and conditioner, considering the masque also.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair for years, and I am always on the look out for products to help keep my color longer. I was excited to try this. When I first smelled the bottle I liked it, a little too flowery for my taste (I prefer fruity smells) but not terrible. However while using it the smell was so strong it tingled my nose. It was stronger a smell than the dye itself was. I didn&#x27;t think much of it at first. I have long upper back length thick hair, and its wavy and prone to drying out. This left my hair dry and not very moisturized (ironic based on the name....) I also noticed discolored water after using it as if it was taking my dye out... which was weird (and didn&#x27;t show any signs of extra fading or anything so I&#x27;ll write this off)&lt;br /&gt;The big problem was I received complaints at work. I had two different co-workers try and figure out what the strong perfume-like chemical smell was and then we finally figured out it was my shampoo. (I hadn&#x27;t dyed my hair for nearly a month so no, it wasn&#x27;t my dye)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A shampoo that was more expensive than my usual, didn&#x27;t moisturize my hair and didn&#x27;t show any improvement for the lasting and quality of my color. Not to mention smells so strong it receives complaints....&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll Pass&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I tried this whole line, every bit of it. Still didn&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually on a recommendation of a friend tried Sauve&#x27;s new professional naturals (the ones in the green bottles) I use the one for colored hair and normal hair.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my hair so ridiculously soft it isn&#x27;t funny. My boyfriend makes fun of me cause I&#x27;m always touching my hair after I use it.&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention how much cheaper it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to write this line (the everpure one) off as expensive gimmick in a pretty bottle.</li>
    <li> So after reading what sulfates in shampoos are, and what they do to the hair. I decided to switch to a sulfate free shampoo. I usually buy salon brand shampoo/conditioner but I decided to give this a try, which for $6 a bottle is a steal! Compared to what I usually pay. I am very pleased with this product overall. It does however have a very strong smell, but it leaves my hair feeling soft and nourished. I only wash my hair about twice a week(fyi it doesn&#x27;t need to be washed anymore) Added with my Moroccan oil before styling, and macadamia oil overnight before washing,  this is the perfect hair care system.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff! I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different products for dyed hair, and this one is by far my favorite. It&#x27;s soft, and lathers easily, unlike a lot of other shampoos I&#x27;ve tried. The conditioner is amazing as well...it really does moisturize, and I don&#x27;t have to use a lot of it to spread it amongst my hair. I love it so much, in fact, that I think I&#x27;ll pick up the EverPure leave-in conditioner too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY recommend this product for anyone looking for an inexpensive, dye-friendly shampoo. I have always been very impressed with the good quality of L&#x27;Oreal products, and this one is no exception.</li>
    <li> I have lots of fine color-treated hair, and like the performance of sulfate free products, but not the price.  This combo keeps my easily weighed down hair shiny, healthy and bouncy.  Color is holding up better, longer and my scalp feels better.  I actually love the smell, it reminds me in scent and intensity of Aveda rosemary-mint product line - personally, it&#x27;s one of my favorite things about the product, but if you like fragrance free products, it may not be for you.  The price for a good quality, high performance product is unbeatable.</li>
    <li> This is the worst smelling shampoo &amp; conditioner I have ever used.  It smells like 409 cleaner!  I don&#x27;t really know if it works well or not because I won&#x27;t be using it again.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that the product helps maintain any existing keratin treatments you have had done, however, I dislike the scent. It has a strong minty/menthol smell that lasts a long time. I think they should use a better natural scent that leaves the hair smelling pretty.</li>
    <li> All I can say is WOW! So here&#x27;s my story. I&#x27;ve decided to start maintaining my hair on my own, and visiting my stylist for trims any other necessary maintenance that I can&#x27;t do on my own. The first thing I did was hopped online and started looking up the best shampoos and conditioners for African American, type 4a hair. I came across Mane N&#x27; Tail, purchased it from my local Sally&#x27;s, and returned it the next day. HORRIBLE! I then stumbled across L&#x27;oreal Ever....products on amazon.com. My local stores didn&#x27;t have the L&#x27;oreal Evercreme line which is what I was initially looking for, so I decided to purchase L&#x27;oreal Everpure Shampoo, Conditioner, and the Deep Restorative Masque.It had great reviews, for the most part. Sulfate free and specializing in moisture, which is exactly what I was looking for! After I washed my hair with the shampoo, I could instantly tell a difference. My hair was so soft and slick, and I didn&#x27;t even need a lot. A little goes a long way with this stuff. I then applied the conditioner and let it sit for about ten minutes. Wow Wow Wow! Even softer! I then applied the Deep Restorative Masque. I don&#x27;t even know if I needed it, since I could tell that my hair was doing wonderfully just with the regular conditioner alone. I let that sit for about an hour. After washing that out, I looked at my hair in the mirror, and it looked and felt like a different head of hair. I have natural hair and right now I am wearing my hair straight, but when I start back to my wash and go looks, I KNOW these products will leave my curls looking defined and moisturized. I applied a dime-sized amount of Moroccan Oil to my hair, concentrating on my ends, blow dryed, and flat ironed, and Wow Wow Wow! My hair had so much shine, and bounce. When using the Mane N&#x27; Tail my hair felt dry, and the ends were rough and tangled, something I&#x27;ve never experienced before. And did I mention the smell?? I&#x27;m sittin here getting whiffs of my hair as I&#x27;m typing this. It will leave your hairsmelling SO GOOD! All three products cost less than $6 a piece at your local Walmart. What a great investment!!</li>
    <li> The smell is terrible.  I&#x27;m not sure if i&#x27;d describe it as medicinal or chemical or what, but i can&#x27;t stand it.  I am not at all impressed by the performance.  The shampoo lathers well but it leaves my hair feeling like a bird&#x27;s nest until i can work the conditioner through.  The conditioner isn&#x27;t great either.  It&#x27;s very thick but doesn&#x27;t leave any impressive shine or softness.  All that said, I WOULD have continued to use the products until i finished the bottles IF both tubes didn&#x27;t split up the sides and leak out.  During the second use of the shampoo, the bottle split in my hand (along the side seam).  A few weeks later, my husband knocked the conditioner over in the shower and that one split up the side and leaked out too.  Okay, so he knocked it over, but they are thin, tubes and not exactly super stable.  I expect more durable packaging.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to try the shampoo and conditioner because I have had horrible results with the loreal color lines. Because sulfate free seems so hard to find, I thought I would give it a try and..... I absolutely love this product!! It is not heavy and the conditioner works great. I have very thick hair that tangles all the time and this went right through it with no problem. There have been a lot of comments on the strong smell, but I like the smell, so it is a personal preference. I too am bothered by alot of scents, but this one is ok for me. The biggest plus is it absolutely extends the length of your hair color!!! Not the roots of course, but I get my hair done every 6 weeks due to stubborn greys.. but it has been almost a year since I have had to have my stylist run the color through to the ends. I just love this product!!</li>
    <li> Hair products can be such an individual thing.  Everyone&#x27;s hair is different.  I happen to love this shampoo and conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s why I love these products:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The pleasant smell.  The light scent stays on my hair all day.  I especially like the rosemary smell of the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It preserves my color.  My hair is highlighted and it stays looking good for several months if I use this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It is just as effective as the expensive salon products.  I&#x27;ll admit it; I&#x27;ve fallen prey to buying the $50.00 salon products.  Sure they worked, but so does L&#x27;Oreal. And L&#x27;Oreal is almost 1/5 the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The conditioner leaves my hair so smooth and silky.  Since I have fine hair, I don&#x27;t use the conditioner every time I shampoo, but about once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one small downside is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to clean my hair as thoroughly as sulfate-based shampoos.  This isn&#x27;t just a L&#x27;Oreal thing though; I&#x27;ve found this to be the case with any sulfate-free shampoo.  It&#x27;s a trade-off between preserving one&#x27;s hair color and having one&#x27;s hair squeaky clean.</li>
