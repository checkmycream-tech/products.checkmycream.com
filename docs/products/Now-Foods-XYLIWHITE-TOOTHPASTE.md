      <li>Best tasting toothpaste definitely buying more.</li>
      <li>We will be ordering more soon.&lt;br</li>
      <li>No nasty chemicals to harm my family or me!</li>
      <li>Especially good if you have crooked teeth like mine :)</li>
      <li>so I love that it has xylitol.</li>
      <li>Zylitol is a natural antibacterial and this is a great product.</li>
      <li>I love that it&#x27;s paraben, sls, and fluoride free.</li>
      <li>The flavor is very mild</li>
      <li>so I needed a toothpaste that wasn&#x27;t too strong a mint flavor that the boys would use.</li>
      <li>It is refreshing and delicately sweet, but doesn&#x27;t taste like candy.</li>
      <li>Nice fresh mint taste without being super strong.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this product in my continuing search for a fluoride free alternative to &amp;#34;big</li>
      <li>Cinnamon is fantastic too if you like the taste.</li>
      <li>it is fluoride free toothpaste that does prevent tooth decay.  </li>
      <li>Fluoride free</li>
      <li>Worth it!</li>
      <li>Taste great and leaves the teeth white and breath fresh.</li>
      <li>Leaves your mouth clean and fresh.  </li>
      <li>it is mild and not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have been looking for a more natural and chemical free toothpaste for my family.</li>
      <li>Comsuming flouride is most commonly from water, and is good for teeth to about the age of 18.</li>
      <li>The whole family liked it and for me the ingredients are natural and no flouride</li>
      <li>If you enjoy fillings and root canal therapy and extractions for you or your kids, and like more health expenses, avoid fluoride, flossing daily, and dentists.</li>
      <li>Have tried many different natural, fluoride free toothpastes, and this is our favorite.  </li>
      <li>Has an odd taste, and not in a good way.</li>
      <li>Fluoride has never been a communist plot nor poisoneous like many suppliments; in the right concentrations, nor like toxins similar to Botox.</li>
      <li>I feel toothpaste is more benifical with some fluoride ions (a natural ion found in most drinking water, from the earth, and in tea and many vegatables in very small quantities).</li>
      <li>Great product, and hard to find in person.</li>
      <li>This is my first non-fluoride toothpaste</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>In the right concentration it is very beneficial to developing teeth, and helps reduce bone fractures.</li>
      <li>I raved about it so much to my husband that he started using it, and he switched over to it too.  </li>
      <li>personal favorite overall is CloSys toothpaste, then this and Tom&#x27;s Gentle.enjoy fillings and root canal therapy and extractions for you or your kids, and like more health expenses, avoid fluoride, flossing daily, and dentists.</li>
      <li>Xylitol seems to really work for harmful bacteria control around teeth.  </li>
      <li>What a shame that we don&#x27;t really know much about what we put into our bodies.</li>
      <li>I enjoy all their flavors and use several of their supplements</li>
      <li>I absolutely cannot recommend this product to anyone.</li>
      <li>Not only does it clean and whiten my teeth, it keeps me from getting cavities.</li>
      <li>And oddly enough, despite the fact that you&#x27;d think that if you scrub your teeth with paste, they&#x27;ll feel clean.</li>
      <li>My personal favorite overall is CloSys toothpaste, then this and Tom&#x27;s Gentle.</li>
      <li>There are better options for less.</li>
      <li>Water that passes the teeth goes to develpoing-teeth (kids) and bones of people with osteoporosis (over 40yo and mainly women but in men also).</li>
      <li>would highly recommend this toothpaste to anyone.</li>
      <li>By the labeling, it looks natural, too, but I suppose I don&#x27;t know much about all the ingredients.</li>
      <li>Love this toothpaste, haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see any change, but do recommend...</li>
      <li>I only buy the \\&quot;Refreshmint\\&quot; flavor as the mint flavor seems too strong and the younger ones don&#x27;t like it.</li>
      <li>Save your money and go with another natural brand.</li>
      <li>Unlike Stevia and the other sweeteners found in toothpaste, this has xyloitol ONLY, which is the only sweetener which actually is healthy for your teeth.</li>
      <li>; I chose this over my usual choice (from Tom&#x27;s) and it was a huge bust.</li>
      <li>love how it&#x27;s not a strong, stinging or burning sensation like you would get from other toothpastes.</li>
      <li>The mint flavor is barely discernible.</li>
      <li>The mint doesn&#x27;t last as long as a normal toothpaste either</li>
      <li>The paste doesn&#x27;t really have any flavor which I like and its not super foamy.</li>
      <li>so it gets a little old having to have two different types of toothpaste in stock because they can&#x27;t have the normal crest or Colgate.</li>

<li> Now I have tubes of the most tasteless toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever tasted.</li>
<li> haven&#x27;t had a single cavity since i started using this.</li>
<li> I brushed for 2 minutes with my badass Sonic brush, and my teeth felt grimy, not clean.</li>
<li> The Fl- ions harden the outer layer of teeth to resist acids from common oral bacteria (streptocococcus mutans) mixing with natural sugar and other things when we let it touch our teeth</li>
<li> i choose this flavor over any other flavor.</li>
<li> Your teeth perceive all the other sweeteners just like sugar and begin making plaque with them.</li>
<li> It acts different than armor-coating teeth with a hard layer through fluoride ion exchange.</li>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s only been a couple of days I can notice the difference and my mouth feels cleaner! Will keep ordering!</li>
    <li> This has a great taste, no toxins and makes your teeth feel extremely clean. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a more natural and chemical free toothpaste for my family. I have two toddlers so it gets a little old having to have two different types of toothpaste in stock because they can&#x27;t have the normal crest or Colgate. Having this one type that is good for all ages is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I love how it&#x27;s not a strong, stinging or burning sensation like you would get from other toothpastes. The flavor is very mild so it doesn&#x27;t taste bad. The mint doesn&#x27;t last as long as a normal toothpaste either so I don&#x27;t feel like cool breathing or bad tastes when I eat food soon after. I love that it&#x27;s paraben, sls, and fluoride free. 4 packs will last a while too. Worth it! And will be purchasing again in the future.</li>
    <li> Zylitol is a natural antibacterial and this is a great product. Cinnamon is fantastic too if you like the taste. No junk in here and most important, no fluoride!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great alternative mainstream brands but it lacks minty flavor.</li>
    <li> I have my husband, son and extented family using this product because of it&#x27;s xylitol content and lack of questionable ingredients.  A dentist of ours had recommended xylitol in the past, although we already knew about it.  We chew gum containing xylitol also.  I only buy the \\&quot;Refreshmint\\&quot; flavor as the mint flavor seems too strong and the younger ones don&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> Great product. Great price. Delivered promptly.</li>
    <li> I enjoy all their flavors and use several of their supplements</li>
    <li> Tastes great, came in a four pack.  I bought this at a health food store a few weeks ago, and I could see a difference in just a few days.&lt;br /&gt;Price was great and I will buy more.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> This is the best toothpaste I have ever used. Not only does it clean and whiten my teeth, it keeps me from getting cavities. I don&#x27;t know about you but I don&#x27;t like going to the dentist. So anything that helps with that is great in my book.</li>
    <li> Have tried many different natural, fluoride free toothpastes, and this is our favorite.  Nice fresh mint taste without being super strong.  Leaves your mouth clean and fresh.  Definitely recommend.  Their strawberry kids toothpaste is also wonderful - our kids love it.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and works great! No nasty chemicals to harm my family or me!</li>
    <li> Wow I&#x27;m not really a review person but I had to say that both myself and my husband had a fairly acute allergic reaction to this product!  We both became itchy and congested after using it!  It took a few days to realize this was what it was from but now that we know obviously won&#x27;t be using it anymore!</li>
    <li> I like to buy it this way.  I have used it for years.  No fluoride to worry about.  Good taste.</li>
    <li> Excellent transaction, excellent product!</li>
    <li> This toothpaste has a great taste. It is refreshing and delicately sweet, but doesn&#x27;t taste like candy. By the labeling, it looks natural, too, but I suppose I don&#x27;t know much about all the ingredients. Who does? What a shame that we don&#x27;t really know much about what we put into our bodies.</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste without all the chemicals found in many toothpaste. Taste great and leaves the teeth white and breath fresh.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is amazing it is fluoride free toothpaste that does prevent tooth decay.  The taste is also great as well it is mild and not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Fluoride free&lt;br /&gt;- Seems to prevent tooth decay for me&lt;br /&gt;- Taste is balanced&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- A little pricey</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is very good, has no things most people do not like, tastes good and does not induce gagging. I feel toothpaste is more benifical with some fluoride ions (a natural ion found in most drinking water, from the earth, and in tea and many vegatables in very small quantities). The warning about swallowing toothpaste is due to the soap (SLS) not the very small amount of fluoride. The Fl- ions harden the outer layer of teeth to resist acids from common oral bacteria (streptocococcus mutans) mixing with natural sugar and other things when we let it touch our teeth i.e citric acid (oranges), lemon (ade), malic acid (tart candy), vinegar (and oil), tomato&#x27;s (and juices), coffee, Gatoraid type drinks, phosphoric acid (a flavor enhancer in diet and non-diet sodas). I recommending rinsing with Act daily, after brushing with this toothpaste, or other fluoride product to reduce the risk of cavities, which is the most common disease in humans (dental caries) and/or use a fluoridated toopaste with mint flavored Listerine (green or blue).&lt;br /&gt;This toothpaste contains no soap that causes many oral afflictions (SLS, or Sodium Lauryl, or lauryth, Succionate/Sulfate) that creates foam (it is in hand and laundry detergents). SLS can cause sensitivity to cold and canker sores (apthous ulcers) as can tarter control toothpastes.&lt;br /&gt;The Xylitol sweetner helps reduce caries also. It is a good sugar substitute. It acts different than armor-coating teeth with a hard layer through fluoride ion exchange. Comsuming flouride is most commonly from water, and is good for teeth to about the age of 18. Water that passes the teeth goes to develpoing-teeth (kids) and bones of people with osteoporosis (over 40yo and mainly women but in men also). In the right concentration it is very beneficial to developing teeth, and helps reduce bone fractures. Fluoride has never been a communist plot nor poisoneous like many suppliments; in the right concentrations, nor like toxins similar to Botox. If you enjoy fillings and root canal therapy and extractions for you or your kids, and like more health expenses, avoid fluoride, flossing daily, and dentists. Similar to religion and politics, one cannot sway people with their beliefs. Enough!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this toothpaste, will buy again but suppliment with fluoride (&#x27;Prevident&#x27;), and I hope this helps someone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My personal favorite overall is CloSys toothpaste, then this and Tom&#x27;s Gentle.enjoy fillings and root canal therapy and extractions for you or your kids, and like more health expenses, avoid fluoride, flossing daily, and dentists.

    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find this toothpaste. I was very glad to find it on Amazon. No flouride. Nice taste and xylitol. Just what the dentist ordered!</li>
    <li> Unlike Stevia and the other sweeteners found in toothpaste, this has xyloitol ONLY, which is the only sweetener which actually is healthy for your teeth. Your teeth perceive all the other sweeteners just like sugar and begin making plaque with them. Not so with Xylotoil. Great product, and hard to find in person.</li>
    <li> Has an odd taste, and not in a good way. Kind of makes me think of fish when ever i start to brush my teeth.</li>
    <li> My sons doctors says no more flouride so I needed a toothpaste that wasn&#x27;t too strong a mint flavor that the boys would use. We use xylitol instead of sugar and my one son has gone from multiple cavities (due to poor health) to only one small one so I love that it has xylitol.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product in my continuing search for a fluoride free alternative to &amp;#34;big toothpaste.&amp;#34; I chose this over my usual choice (from Tom&#x27;s) and it was a huge bust. Now I have tubes of the most tasteless toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever tasted. The mint flavor is barely discernible. And oddly enough, despite the fact that you&#x27;d think that if you scrub your teeth with paste, they&#x27;ll feel clean. Not true with this product. I brushed for 2 minutes with my badass Sonic brush, and my teeth felt grimy, not clean. I absolutely cannot recommend this product to anyone. Save your money and go with another natural brand. There are better options for less.</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste. Works well and great taste.  Will order again as I have before.</li>
    <li> I only use this toothpaste now. i probably will for the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste, haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see any change, but do recommend...</li>
    <li> best toothpaste ever! haven&#x27;t had a single cavity since i started using this. it fits the description. i choose this flavor over any other flavor. very refreshing. prompt delivery. perfect in every way. recommended for everyone!</li>
    <li> Good texture and taste.  Xylitol seems to really work for harmful bacteria control around teeth.  Especially good if you have crooked teeth like mine :)</li>
    <li> What everyone said.  This is the best toothpaste ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Teeth stays cleaner longer, easy to rinse (doesn&#x27;t have SLS, so you don&#x27;t have to rinse forever trying to get that stuff off), just perfect.</li>
    <li> Best tasting toothpaste definitely buying more.</li>
    <li> I really love this toothpaste!  This is my first non-fluoride toothpaste and I think I chose well (after looking over all the reviews).  This toothpaste tastes pleasant, and is very light and foamy when you start brushing.  I don&#x27;t miss the slight salty and artificial taste of the fluoride at all.  My teeth are whiter and my gums look healthier.  I raved about it so much to my husband that he started using it, and he switched over to it too.  We will be ordering more soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this toothpaste to anyone.</li>
    <li> Does its job without fluoride, unfortunately my tap water isn&#x27;t treated to remove it yet. The paste doesn&#x27;t really have any flavor which I like and its not super foamy.</li>
    <li> The whole family liked it and for me the ingredients are natural and no flouride so win-win!</li>
    <li> Excellent. Flavor takes some getting used to, but this is a great alternative to chemical toothpastes</li>
    <li> Happy with this if you want a non fluoride paste</li>
