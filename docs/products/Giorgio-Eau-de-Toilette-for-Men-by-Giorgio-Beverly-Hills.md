      <li>I love it, women always ask what cologne is that.</li>
      <li>A classic I loved many years ago.</li>
      <li>Amazon has a great price and convenient free delivery on orders over #25, not hard to get there with all the bargains available&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended</li>
      <li>It is not as strong as it once was.</li>
      <li>but I did not like it as the smell is just too strong and overpowering in my opinion.</li>
      <li>,it is strong, spicy and durable</li>
      <li>The comments I&#x27;ve read address the Longevity and Sillage, and that both of these are not as good or rated as high now that it is made in the U.S. America?</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been a happy customer with this cologne since the early 1980&#x27;s, when it was originally made in Italy.</li>
      <li>The refreshing smell is not too strong but just right.</li>
      <li>They used to sell an even stronger version (it may still be available) that is the strongest cologne I have every owned (I had to give it away).</li>
      <li>Georgio .. surprising for its beautiful packaging on yellow stripes, makes up an air of nobility to men of modern detaque that surprises with its extraordinary capacity creation in a modern color.</li>
      <li>I have an original bottle from the 80&#x27;s and this product is not even close to the original production.</li>
      <li>This company has to stop advertising this product under the original name.  </li>
      <li>There have been comments made on FRAGRANTICA.COM about the quality of this product, since it was originally made in Italy.</li>
      <li>A true gem.</li>
      <li>one of my favorite colognes, very inexpensive.</li>
      <li>about 6-8 hours which is unusual for most scents.</li>
      <li>people liken to Givenchy Gentleman, but that would be an insult to that masterpiece by Givenchy, is sweet, warm and the composition is similar, but for some reason are not accurate, I prefer Givenchy, but for this price is excellent.</li>
      <li>Brings back good memories.</li>
      <li>it is fantastic, i used it in 1990s in the first time and til</li>
      <li>Giorgio is a classic &amp; amazing men&#x27;s cologne having been on the market for near 30 years.</li>
      <li>And I did not put very much of it on.</li>
      <li>I really enjoyed this scent when I was younger.  </li>
      <li>This is my first review in all my purchases in amazon and I</li>
      <li>i must admit he will not be the only one enjoying this gift</li>
      <li>There are some things that the French just do better than anyone.</li>
      <li>Pretty &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;, it can be used day or night, very &amp;#34;classy&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still not sure whether it&#x27;s just as good though...  </li>
      <li>Just a classic men&#x27;s scent that last longer than most....</li>
      <li>Better than I expected.  </li>
      <li>My dad absolutely loves this stuff.</li>
      <li>but it was still too much for me.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;felt compelled to be so honest in my critical and personal opinion.</li>
      <li>I have always liked this cologne, I should say though the scent of this new batch is not as intense as previous ones</li>
      <li>The previous version was made in France and was a little more potent, but this one works well enough and is reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>This is a new addition to my collection...</li>
      <li>Depending on how much you use, this bottle will last for a couple years.</li>
      <li>You won&#x27;t go wrong with this - it has a beautiful scent that lasts a long time.  </li>
      <li>It has overtones of more traditional and alluring essences like sandalwood, patchouli, amber and vanilla (to name but a few).</li>
      <li>Subtle, but sexy.</li>
      <li>The new USA made Giorgio is extremely similar to the older French made formulation that I remember so well.  </li>
      <li>I was very happy to have this cologne return after having to pay outrageous prices on Ebay for older bottles.  </li>

    <li> Giorgio is a classic &amp; amazing men&#x27;s cologne having been on the market for near 30 years. It compliments those who wear it and intrigues those who encounter them. Though it did have a larger audience in days past, it still tops my list of one of the &amp;#34;Best Men&#x27;s Colognes of All Time&amp;#34;. Giorgio for Men is a very complex scent with a woody Asian base. It has overtones of more traditional and alluring essences like sandalwood, patchouli, amber and vanilla (to name but a few). It is a &#x27;must have scent&#x27; to add to your repertoire &amp; the go to place to purchase it is Amazon.com - A definite FIVE STAR RATING for an ALL-STAR ITEM from a long time user.</li>
    <li> Love this cologne is my favorite scent made have been looking for it for quite awhile could only find it at sears years ago. Have been a loyal customer of this cologne for many years!!</li>
    <li> I get complements every where I go</li>
    <li> This is a  cologne I wore years ago and someone on an  elevator told me how wonderful I smelled! So, I wore it for years but somehow fell off the wagon ( think the store where I made the purchase stopped carrying it) until I spotted it recently when I was looking  for another cologne. Smells just as it did years ago!</li>
    <li> Very nice, good price.  Not exactly the Giorgio I remember but it is extremely close.  I really enjoyed this scent when I was younger.  Brings back good memories.</li>
    <li> Better than I expected.  Just like 1988 all over again</li>
    <li> it is fantastic, i used it in 1990s in the first time and til now i find it great ,it is strong, spicy and durable</li>
    <li> A classic I loved many years ago. Although I&#x27;m no expert, it seems a mix of wood and plants aroma. Pretty &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;, it can be used day or night, very &amp;#34;classy&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Arrived in great packaging and the price is great too. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> The new USA made Giorgio is extremely similar to the older French made formulation that I remember so well.  You won&#x27;t go wrong with this - it has a beautiful scent that lasts a long time.  I&#x27;m still not sure whether it&#x27;s just as good though...  There are some things that the French just do better than anyone.</li>
    <li> I believe that Giorgio has changed its formula over the years. It is not as strong as it once was. They used to sell an even stronger version (it may still be available) that is the strongest cologne I have every owned (I had to give it away). This product is among the classiest on the market. Try it!</li>
    <li> Longevity: 9/10&lt;br /&gt;Projection: 9/10&lt;br /&gt;Fragance: 7/10&lt;br /&gt;Many people liken to Givenchy Gentleman, but that would be an insult to that masterpiece by Givenchy, is sweet, warm and the composition is similar, but for some reason are not accurate, I prefer Givenchy, but for this price is excellent.</li>
    <li> I was very happy to have this cologne return after having to pay outrageous prices on Ebay for older bottles.  The previous version was made in France and was a little more potent, but this one works well enough and is reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Tried this fragrance but I did not like it as the smell is just too strong and overpowering in my opinion. And I did not put very much of it on. I just put on a tad of it but it was still too much for me.</li>
    <li> Excellent I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Just a classic men&#x27;s scent that last longer than most....about 6-8 hours which is unusual for most scents.</li>
    <li> My husband had been looking for some Giorgio so when I saw this it made a great stocking stuffer.  It has a very nice scent that doesn&#x27;t bother my sinuses like some scents do.</li>
    <li> I have always liked this cologne, I should say though the scent of this new batch is not as intense as previous ones</li>
    <li> It has a great smell, and size of the item is what I wanted, and the price is very good, and the packing was great.</li>
    <li> My husband put it on and un-knowingly, I kept thinking that I smelled bug spray.  I finally mentioned my confusion as we don&#x27;t have a need for such on the inside and he admitted, he had put on the Giorgio.  After a good laugh, I have put the bottle in the garage.  Almost spring in Tennessee, so sure we can use it there.  Not worth the postage to return........</li>
    <li> Smells close to what I remember from the 80&#x27;s but has a cologne mixed with perfume smell.</li>
    <li> This is the worse fragrance that I ever had the pleasure to smell&lt;br /&gt;for all of you that gave it five stars you have the  poorest taste in&lt;br /&gt;mens cologne.This is my first review in all my purchases in amazon and I&lt;br /&gt;felt compelled to be so honest in my critical and personal opinion.</li>
    <li> This is a Great Value. There have been comments made on FRAGRANTICA.COM about the quality of this product, since it was originally made in Italy. The comments I&#x27;ve read address the Longevity and Sillage, and that both of these are not as good or rated as high now that it is made in the U.S. America? I decided to find out for myself and ordered some this August 2012. I&#x27;ve been a happy customer with this cologne since the early 1980&#x27;s, when it was originally made in Italy. When I received the product; Giorgio Beverly Hills By Georgio Beverly Hills for Men, I was Amazed!!! I found that the Longevity and Sillage of this colonge are every bit as good as it was when it was first made in Italy!!! This cologne smells great and is very unique and I&#x27;ve had some good complements on it. If thats what you&#x27;re looking for than this is a Good selection and an Excellent value. Definitions - (Longevity) The length or duration of life: (Sillage) -(pronounced as see-yazh) is a term used to describe a scented trail left by the fragrance wearer.</li>
    <li> Georgio .. surprising for its beautiful packaging on yellow stripes, makes up an air of nobility to men of modern detaque that surprises with its extraordinary capacity creation in a modern color. Buy recommend men force of creation</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of this cologne. My wife and other women are always commenting.</li>
    <li> my friend uses this product so i bought it for him on his birthday, when he saw his gift he was so happy.  he is one of those guys who always smell soooo good.  i must admit he will not be the only one enjoying this gift</li>
    <li> My dad absolutely loves this stuff. And this seems to be the only place I can find it anymore. Good price, too.</li>
    <li> This is a new addition to my collection... It is woody and sunny-warm... Lasts for 8+ hr... I like it...</li>
    <li> Great product. Great price!</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance of course coz I have been using it since it came out but not happy with shipping (very slow)</li>
    <li> This company has to stop advertising this product under the original name.  I have an original bottle from the 80&#x27;s and this product is not even close to the original production. It is not returnable, so I am putting this one in the trash because it does not even smell good!</li>
    <li> Rich and beautiful. A wonderful scent for men. Thank you amazon.  A captivating scent comprised of honey, earthiness and musk.  A true gem.</li>
    <li> I have used this cologne for years and it&#x27;s still may favorite. I was thankful to find it on Amazon for a very good price. Depending on how much you use, this bottle will last for a couple years. My wife LOVES this, so I can&#x27;t argue with that!</li>
    <li> everything was in perfect order, ... I would gladly use this company again, anytime, first rate, all around. one of my favorite colognes, very inexpensive.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok but it does not seem to last. Smells nice I&#x27;m told while it does.</li>
