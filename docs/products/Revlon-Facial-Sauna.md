<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like this product, it really helps to open my pores and i feel that after using it I can clean my face better/ more thoroughly, it is also very helpful if you have dry skin. My only complaints are that it gets very hot and you have to move your head around in order to get your chin and forehead. Maybe I just have a big head ;)</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for 2 days and it definitely does the job for my sinuses/postnasal drip. I haven&#x27;t been hacking and spitting as much and the facial cone makes my pores open with softer skin. You do have to breathe deeply; in through your nose, out through your mouth to make the steam work evenly. FYI: It does get very hot, so at times I have to pull away from the cone.</li>
    <li> I use this twice a week after cleaning. adding few drops of tea tree oil in the water really helps with pimples.&lt;br /&gt;It helps to open the pores on face, so face lotions can be absorbed better by skin.</li>
    <li> 5 Stars are well deserved! It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to clean! It actually gets pretty HOT too! It will really open up those pores which will allow you to throughly clean your skin! Great product for a great price!</li>
    <li> It works great for how I use it, maybe once a weeks. Although it would be nice if it had a timer on it, and some other indicator of when it was ready to use.</li>
    <li> It took a while to heat up and just overall didn&#x27;t seem to work that great. I don&#x27;t use it and wish that I never bought it.</li>
    <li> So my daughter and I have both been wanting to get a steamer.  Heating water over the stove works, but it&#x27;s a pain, and it&#x27;s hard to make sure the steam doesn&#x27;t get too hot.  After reading customer reviews for several steamers on Amazon, i decided to go with this one.  I&#x27;ve used it several times now and find it very effective and easy to use.  It comes with a measuring cup with 2 lines, one for about 5-10 minutes of steam and one for about 10-15 minutes of steam.  I use the larger amount of water.  I put it in the steamer reservoir before getting in the shower; I also like to put a few drops of an essential oil in with the water.  The instructions don&#x27;t say whether you can do this, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the steamer using the oil, so far.  You do want to be careful how you inhale over the steamer and keep your eyes closed, though, because the heat does enhance the effects of the oil.  I&#x27;ve been using ravintsara oil and fennel oil, but another good one is lavender.  I turn the steamer on when I get out of the shower, and it&#x27;s ready to use by the time I get dried off and pull my hair back out of the way.  If you put a towel over your head and neck when you steam, it really maximizes the steaming effect.  The cone keeps the steam around your face and also provides a nice way to make sure you&#x27;re not getting too close to the steam because the steam can get pretty warm.  The steamer keeps the steam at a pretty consistent rate and temperature.  When done, I wipe off and dry the surfaces of the steamer prior to putting it away.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.  The only kind of odd thing about the product is that the \\&quot;nose cone\\&quot; (which I haven&#x27;t used yet) kinda looks like something that came from an xxx website - LOL eek!!</li>
    <li> The product is made out of bad plastic, the steam is feeble and not strong. The cup does not stay in place i would not recommend purchasing this product</li>
    <li> You are better off with a pot of boiling water</li>
    <li> The Revlon Facial Sauna takes as long to heat up as it would to boil water on stove.Its not strong enough to blow steam on face and you can,t put enough water in it to last very long..I suppose they have made it weaker because of a lawsuit!(Like the woman that spilled hot coffee in her lap and sued the fast food place)No one takes responsibility for their own actions.</li>
    <li> iT WORKS BUT I WISH IT WAS MORE ADVANCE ITS TOO SIMPLE</li>
    <li> Great value!!! Easy to use. I Love it!!!</li>
    <li> it take a while to blow steam I don&#x27;t like the cone where the face is place but it des the job</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this product a 5 out of 5 because it does exactly what it says it does.  It will bubble up with tons of steam, and you can get a nice hot facial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I&#x27;m not sure about is whether this actually helps your skin.  I&#x27;ve been using the product for a few weeks now, and haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOLLOW UP: I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month now, and I guess it does work! My skin looks great!! People have even commented on it, saying I have a glow. So, I&#x27;m going to go ahead and say that steam is awesome!</li>
    <li> This is a great inexpensive product. And if you have allegy problems, it is wonderful!</li>
    <li> After trying two other steam inhalers, I bought this one and it works great.</li>
    <li> I just love my facial sauna! I received it a couple of weeks ago and it works great.... I see a big difference in my skin already. I purchased this product from Acme Trading ....they are the best! They are very reliable and their customer service is great I recommend this product from this seller to anyone.</li>
    <li> I got this product to use for the spa function, but also to use when sick as a vaporizer.  It works really well and is cheaper than the other personal humidifiers I looked at.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m disappointed with this purchase. Takes forever to heat up and doesn&#x27;t provide enough steam.</li>
    <li> Does not put out as much steam as I was expecting ,in fact ,there is a small chamber for water and it lasts for approx 30 mins</li>
    <li> I purchased this to do at-home facials between appointments. I am pretty lazy so this hasn&#x27;t gotten that much use but I do like it. I think it&#x27;s a great product for the price and it definitely does a great job steaming. I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Good but for the price listed</li>
    <li> Not impressed!  Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough, can&#x27;t add any salt to water to help pores get added benefits.  Its more like a child&#x27;s toy to play spa.</li>
    <li> Worth it.  Gentle steam.  I only use the facial cone. It is beautiful. I can feel my pore is opened by the vapor.</li>
    <li> Function-wise the item works well. The steam is generated quickly and lasts for a good while. But the huge problem is that a terrible strong odor is generated alongside the steam whether or not I use the attached cones. It smells like burning plastic and renders it pretty much unusuable. I thought it would go away after a few uses but it didn&#x27;t, so it became a desk accessory. I can&#x27;t tell whether or not it&#x27;s improved my skin because I can&#x27;t even use it.  Recently, several weeks after buying the unit, I decided to try it again and the odor is much weaker now, though still noticeable, so I&#x27;m upgrading it from one star to three. However, I think it&#x27;s unacceptable that I&#x27;ve had to let the product sit so long before I can actually start using it. No one else seems to have this problem though, so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just my unit that&#x27;s defective.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never owned a facial steamer before, but this one seems too flimsy and the output of steam seemed pretty useless. I had to stick my face all the way in to really feel anything. I&#x27;d be better off with a pot of freshly heated water from the stove onto my kitchen table (cooling it down a few minutes after I take it off the burner, of course!) I just didn&#x27;t feel that it was really getting into my pores and opening them up. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again, it seemed to be a waste of money and time.  I&#x27;m stuck with it since I don&#x27;t think it is worth paying to send it back.</li>
    <li> It is a good product for the price.Heaths up in few minutes,comes with a measuring cup,easy to use,lightweight.I&#x27;ve used it 5 times so far,satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> First time trying this type of product and I like it.  It gets very hot, but it works.</li>
    <li> This is a classic purchase for anyone who is a regular at home facials, especially for cleaning out pores and smoothing skin tone.</li>
    <li> My only complaint is that the steam gets almost too hot where I can&#x27;t keep my face too close without it feeling like it&#x27;s burning me. I have to keep a distance between the machine and I when I use it.</li>
    <li> I am using the nasal inhaler for my cough and sore throat this winter, and it is really helping me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been stuggling with my face ever since i got pregnant three years ago. None of my favorite products worked anymore and I couldn&#x27;t find anyting new that worked right. I bought this about 3 weeks ago and LOVE it. My pores are smaller, my face is less oily, my acne is going away. You name it, this product is doing it. The steam is just the right temp, the face cone is the right shape, and the nasal cone works great for the dry nose. It is a little awkward bending over it for 15 minutes, but I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> This is a great home steamer. it heats up fairly fast and steamed my face nicely. I put a light towel over the back of my head to keep the steam in and around my face, i had to move my head a little to target my chin area but nothing too major. I noticed a little bit of a plastic-y smell but i think that will eventually go away. I put a drop of essential oil in the water and it pretty much covered that plastic smell up.</li>
    <li> no steam, I thought I would get a nice steam to do facial by myself. I waited and waited and there was only a little steam.</li>
    <li> This item was terrible! I took it out filled with distilled water and waited 30 minutes for just a trickle of steam!I then stuck my entire face in it which they tell you not to do and waited,it heated my face but hardly any steam so i lifted it off the base and noticed a tiny bit of slightly boiling water and within 2 minutes the water was gone!The nasal cone was hard plastic and you really have to hover over it as well as the facial part!You are better off boiling a pot of water on the stove!Don&#x27;t waste your money!I gave it 1 Star!I give Amazon 5 Stars for rapid shipping and rapid Return!</li>
    <li> When I do my homey mask I steem my face for 5minutes and just let the honey slide off in the steam then when I&#x27;m done I rinse my face with worm water then pat dry. When I&#x27;m done my face is soo beautiful and glowing. I definitely recommend this product</li>
    <li> It works great and is a great price.</li>
    <li> it stopped working right after a month!!!!! waste of money and i can&#x27;t return it now because it says this item is no longer eligible for return!!!</li>
    <li> I plugged it in and it wouldn&#x27;t heat up. Never bothered to complain, just bought a better one in Bed, Bath, and Beyond.</li>
    <li> I like this sauna it works well and it&#x27;s easy to use . The only thing is that u have to use it for at least 20-30 min to see your full pores open but my neck hurts just bending over . But if u have patients get it. I don&#x27;t mind the wait because it does work and the price is great. You just have to be patient with this product. The steam comes out in few seconds so that&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> After reading and reading reviews, I spent the $20 and then bought one for my mom. This little facial steamer is warm and wonderful. During the first few uses, there is an icky plastic smell, so I recommend running it a couple times to lessen that before sticking your head in there. No review warned me about that, so I wanted to let you know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the full face cone and the nasal cone. I have also added (thought the directions say to add NOTHING) a few drops of Olba&#x27;s Oil to the water to help open sinuses (must keep eyes closed!). I wash the base and cones carefully and thoroughly after each use and have had no problem with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a pain leaning over the thing for 10-15 minutes, esp if you have a bad back or sore neck, so PRACTICE before you fill it with water so you know what position (standing, sitting, etc.) will be most comfortable for your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mom used it during her last head and chest cold and loved it - said it really helped her. I have a blown-hot air house (read DRY) and this little device is helping me through the winter very nicely. Use it a couple times a week for maximum impact.</li>
    <li> The sauna is uneven, and the heat is too hot sometimes</li>
    <li> Nice size and lightweight. The facial cone/guard is also a very nice size for steam to come through and face to fit into. I did have a couple of incidences where the cone/guard came undone from the base as it has a little notch and channel where it &amp;#34;unlocks&amp;#34; from the base, however, I guess because I am aware of it now I am more careful so it hasn&#x27;t come undone since. Heats up fast and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;spit&amp;#34; steam so you get burned. All-in-all, I am happy with it. Have used it about five times so far.  I have not used the Inhaler Cone yet, so can&#x27;t review.</li>
    <li> a great product does the job I want on my skin,the nasal clearer a bonus and great too and speedy delivery</li>
    <li> I have to hold the button to keep it running. Was hoping it was a fluke from other reviewers, but mine arrived the same way. It&#x27;s a good little steamer, but it&#x27;s a PITA to have to keep my finger on the switch &amp;#34;just so&amp;#34; to keep it running for 10-20mins.</li>
    <li> Good product, works well and produces lots of steam.</li>
    <li> Does what it says it will do.</li>
    <li> It only holds a tiny bit of water, there&#x27;s no place to rest your face, its no better than holding your face over a pot on the stove.</li>
    <li> This a great facial steamer!  I have always just boiled water and put my face over the pot with a towel over my head to give it a steam feeling.  I was sick of waiting for the water to boil and carrying the hot pot into my bathroom so I purchased this off of a recommendation from a friend.  I put the water in, 2 drops of Tea Tree Oil and let my face steam for 5-10 minutes.  I love it and highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> my wife likes it but she&#x27;s strarted putting wet face cloths in the microwave instead...Honey. why did you buy this if your not going to use it!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this thing it&#x27;s oerfect for what I bought it for. It get hot enough . I would recommend putting a towel over your head to lock in a ll the steam. Only problem I have is where to sit when I&#x27;m doing it. The bathroom counter seems the most feasible without tiring out my bneck muscles lol.</li>
    <li> Just what I ordered and needed.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This facial sauna is very easy to use. I have not yet to encounter any problem with it, and I think I have brought it over a year ago. I feel great every time after using it. It&#x27;s really soothing for the face. I would recommend this product to anyone who would like to hydrate their facial skin.</li>
    <li> It does not give much steam, but if you are patient, you will get what you are looking for.  Holding your head over a pot with a towel over your head would work better.  However, if you are trying to get a child to use the nose feature for colds, this would work like a charm.</li>
    <li> Great buy. I love using this on Saturday mornings. I would recommend buying this product. Would make as a nice gift for someone also.</li>
    <li> Worth every penny and much cheaper than going to a salon. Easy set up and lots of steam when it heats up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product a couple times now, to which it steamed my face very nicely. Relaxing, hydrating, and everything I had hoped it would be.&lt;br /&gt;However, I tried turning it on tonight to no avail. I&#x27;ve tried different sockets throughout the house, but no such luck. Might anyone be able to tell me what is wrong?&lt;br /&gt;Other than this hiccup, I&#x27;m very pleased with it! I have yet to see any results, but that&#x27;s probably because I&#x27;ve only used it for three days thus far.</li>
    <li> nice, cheap steamer to open up your pores for cleansing. with that said, it is not as good as a salon/spa quality steamer, and doesnt appear to be nearly as powerful. but for the price, it does the job well.</li>
    <li> Yes this little steamer does get the job done. It produces steam for my at home facials, doesn&#x27;t take too long to start steaming and I don&#x27;t have to keep refilling the little \\&quot;pot\\&quot; where you put the water to heat up. I am happy with this purchase and glad I finally brought it.</li>
    <li> This is  VERY basic and small.  I have not yet used this item.  However I did fill it up and let it run dry.  There was no leaking or sputtering of&lt;br /&gt;water.</li>
    <li> This was absolutely the best thing I have ever done for my skin, until it lit on fire and started flinging sparks across my room. I had only owned it for about a month when this happened.</li>
    <li> It is a good quality, and easy to handle, not complicated at all to operate, steams good and price represents the quality</li>
    <li> kind of bulky to use and keep on counter</li>
    <li> Works really good. I have awful sinus problems. Helps me relax too. Easy to clean and care for. Lots of good steam.</li>
    <li> Not steam enough. It looks more like a kid toy.</li>
    <li> This one was somewhat funny. I&#x27;m not sure where did I get the notion that this sauna was supposed to be close to scald your face or something. I remember doing a few of these while I was a child (because was nosy that way lol) and even though is hard to remember I dont&#x27; remember being as hot as I was expecting. Anyway, when i first used it I wasn&#x27;t pleased w. the fact that it wasn&#x27;t a burning heat but rather a comfortable heat that was still working on my face (I know, weird.) I thought that the vapor wasn&#x27;t hot enough lol but... the fact that it wasn&#x27;t hot was a good thing I use this sauna 3 times a week prior to use my derma roller and my face loves it</li>
    <li> this works great! it actually gets a little bit too hot though so I have to lift my face out of it here and there. the part that is for your sinuses also works amazingly! its helped my daughter ALOT with her allergy congestion</li>
    <li> Great for the lungs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this to help my lungs when they get tight from colds, etc.  It works just great.  There was NO odor.  The pieces are small enough to be easily stored and are soft plastic, not brittle that breaks.  It heats quickly and I keep an extra container of water handy in case I want more steam.  Works just great.</li>
    <li> Great for the price. I&#x27;ve been using it every other day and it has held up well. Gets hot quick and produces a good amount of steam.</li>
    <li> I have rosecea and combined with a good cleansing system it helps keep my acne under control. Definitely put it on a low table or desk and get a comfortable chair. I also put a towel over my head to cover to &amp;#34;spread&amp;#34; out the steam.</li>
    <li> I have to say for the price I really like this sauna. To enhance it I put a towel over the front of my head and it&#x27;s salon approved ;-). For my African American (like myself)women with anything but your natural hair the towel trick will 1. Loosen any gel or holding spray 2. Unlax (I know it&#x27;s not a word) your tex/lax 3. Make your texturized roots wavy and you get the point. Also right after I use it I use my \\&quot;tool\\&quot; to extract any blackheads and it works wonderfully! I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s works on pimples as well. It&#x27;s definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> Biggest piece of garbage, buy another brand!  This one worked ONCE.  Then stopped when I had a horrible sinus infection and it quit after one use!  Take it back to who?  I bought it 2 months ago, didn&#x27;t need it till now so no receipts left.  I bought it here, but no idea from who.  SAVE YOUR PACKAGING or just buy at a local store, easier to return.  For $20, this is a waste o my time more than money.  It&#x27;s irritating as hell to take the time to order this online, waiting for it to be delivered and then it doesn&#x27;t work?  No, I&#x27;ll be replacing this from a store, and NOT REVLON, ANYTHING.  CONAIR MADE A GOOD ONE...Going to find that one.  It lasted me 6 years!  Same price too.</li>
    <li> The first one did not turn on. The second one worked for about two weeks. The third one would not turn on. When it worked, it was quite nice, but I am tired of schlepping to the UPS store to ship it back.</li>
    <li> Okay, I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s wrong with me.  All I wanted was an easy, fast operating facial steamer, but instead of ordering this, with one large reservoir, I ordered the Conair mister two tiny little reservoirs to complicate my process.  I returned the Conair, unused, and replaced it with the Revlon Facial Sauna  - which I love.  Very easy to use, and takes up virtually no shelf space.</li>
    <li> cute and handy little home-steamer. Probably never gonna use the breathing cup but whatever, still nice to have. Steam gets really hot and really works to open pores, but its really lightweight and easy to tip over. The plastic feels kind of cheap so i hope it lasts! For the money, not many complaints at all!</li>
    <li> It works! Although it is kind of awkward positioning it does the trick for the price. Be sure to use distilled water though!</li>
    <li> The steam seem a little TOO hot to actually keep face still for more than 3-5 seconds which defeats the purpose. I &#x27;m going to stick to a hot wash cloth pressed on the face</li>
    <li> Works great.  Very pleasant on skin.  I only use until face sweats (couple of minutes) and then use a toner and then a moisturizer.  Recommend heating up water before washing face...then machine ready to use.  Great price for product that does exactly what I hoped for.  Very light weight, very simple.  I think it is perfect for home facial.</li>
    <li> Well, this can be use as advertise or sinus inhaler. it&#x27;s work great which can easily help to remove black head and deep clean.</li>
    <li> I expected it will really steam the face very quick, but you need to heat it up like for 10-15 minutes, than to sit like 15 minutes to start your face steaming a bit.  And after all of that time spend I, like a person who does many things for my skin, can say that I get better results just staying under the hot shower for 5 minutes. The steam flow is sooo gentle that this peace of plastic can not be called &amp;#34;sauna&amp;#34; at all.</li>
    <li> My nose was stuffy for quite sometime because my workplace has been doing some reconstruction. All the dust and pollen has been irritating my nose like crazy! Luckily I received the Revlon Sauna in time, my nose is stuff-free hahaha. Also,it works great as a facial sauna. I love to use it at night, and then use a green tea scrub following.</li>
    <li> It is just this side of perfect! Nice compact size (place face above it and not in it), not heavy, long cord, and the sinus attachment is a clever extra that both my husband and I use in our dry climate. Another use I discovered is sterilizing metal tools by placing them in the cone for about 10 minutes. Tweezers, files, extractors, clippers, you name it. And I do like that pink color!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big believer in &amp;#34;less is more&amp;#34;.  When my sinuses  started acting up during the past hellish winter, I looked for mechanical relief, and found the Revlon Facial Sauna.  It&#x27;s one of the best things I&#x27;ve ever purchased!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very low tech--there!s a small water reservoir heated by the sauna.  You stick your face in a cone over the reservoir and reap the benefits.  Skin and breathing passages work a lot better after a session, and when I added some rosemary mint essential oil  to the reservoir, oh my!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing us small.  I found a place to put it in the world&amp;#34;s smallest bathroom, but if I had to leave it  out all the time, I would.  Get this!  You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> It had problems turning on right out of the box. It also had the strong plastic/chemical-y smell others described, and when it did eventually work, the steam produced was really just kinda laughable. Certainly not enough for a good facial. I can do better, no I HAVE done better with a small pot of boiled water and a towel. For $20 I pretty much got what I deserved, lol.</li>
    <li> Easy to set up and use. Steam gets quite hot, more than I expected it would, so that was a nice surprise. Great for at home facials and for clearing up congestion due to illness!</li>
    <li> This is a waste of a product. Dont bother. Its just bulky and annoying. You&#x27;re better off just taking a steamy shower or running the shower hot and sitting in the bathroom. Same benefits. Only thing I could see this being very good at is clearing sinuses with the nose attachment when you have a cold or the flu.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about anyone else,  the steam is not hot enough for me</li>
    <li> Helps face and sinus.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item because steaming helps with my blemishes and I was tired of boiling water on the stove.  This item gets hot enough to effectively steam your face.  I think it is a good purchase for a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> This little machine works wonders! Just be faithful to a routine usage and you will be amazed by the difference in your skins appearance.</li>
    <li> Arrived in poor condition!&lt;br /&gt;Unit doesn&#x27;t even work! Every time i try to turn it on, the flickers on and off.</li>
    <li> Nice machine not really powerful</li>
    <li> So amazing and healthy for my skin! I love using this once a week to cleanse my skin from the extremities of living in a city!</li>
    <li> Love the vaporizer! Very good and softens the skin of the entire face. I absolutely recommend it! God Bless you</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly, produces lots of steam, and my skin looks great after.  My mother and sister also use this product and we have all noticed a difference in our skin with just four weeks of use.</li>
    <li> SUPER QUICK SHIPPING!!!  My husband and I both have horrible allergies and always steam bathroom and use that to help, this should save water and timte!  Thumbs UP</li>
    <li> Very good product.  I use it for softening fine lines and it does do the job. I Use twice a day.</li>
    <li> I have issues with acne/overly oily face. At the end of the day, with makeup, and just from being out, my face feels really really gross. It feels good to take a hot shower and I feel like my pores can really open up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a fabric steamer which ran out too fast for clothing but was actually great for quickly producing lots of thick steam really, really fast. However, since it&#x27;s a fabric steamer, I always was nervous that it would bubble up and scald my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t really call this a facial steamer. I guess they call it a &amp;#34;sauna&amp;#34;. Probably it&#x27;s not very strong for the exact reason I mentioned - if it can scald someone, they&#x27;re going to get sued, have recalls, etc. This honestly produces the same amount of steam as you would get holding your face over a bowl of very hot water - perhaps even less. The only way to get a lot of steam is to completely block everything with your face, and that&#x27;s still just not enough. I thought the face shape would help but honestly when I was using the fabric steamer I liked being able to target greasy feeling areas. I felt like the edges of my face didn&#x27;t get enough steam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get a fabric steamer, if you&#x27;re brave :)</li>
    <li> I use this for sinus problems. works great</li>
    <li> I love my facial sauna!  I am sure this will also work for the allergies/flu, etc. symptom relief. It does not leak, does not get too hot, gets the job done. I always use only distiller water so there is no mineral build up.</li>
    <li> Works great! It is very relaxing and my face feels so clean after I use it. I use it to clean out my sinus too:)</li>
    <li> Love to steam my face when it feels extra yucky, this does the job great. I get a towl and drap it over my head to keep the steam in, for 10 to 15 min and then wash my face with the Clarisonic deep pore brush.. works wonders!!</li>
    <li> It makes me feel relax and soften my skin, but the temperature may be too high sometimes.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mother and was there while she used it a few times. I&#x27;ve been told by her that it does a good job of cleaning her pores other than that I can&#x27;t vouch for its effectiveness but I can comment on its quality, etc...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, when we pulled it out of the box, one of the rubber feet had fallen off, after some searching to find it we simply re-attached it with a dab of super glue. Other than that build \\&quot;malfunction\\&quot; the device seems entirely sound, it heats of water quickly and so far, safely. The two included accessories make this very easy to use, and the device is so simple (1 button) that anyone could use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose to get my mother this facial sauna because other reviewers commented on another one that it had \\&quot;exploded\\&quot; and burned their users, I was weary of even purchasing this one but no reviews of that sort made us decide it was ok. So far, after probably 20 or so uses, its worked fine with no negative consequences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to some other options on the market, this is very small (which is what she wanted), something that could be easily stored under a sink or without taking up much room in the closet. It&#x27;s perfect for apartments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a final note, this facial sauna (as I&#x27;m sure others do as well) says that it needs distilled water, it has no moving parts though so it really should effect anything other than keeping it super \\&quot;clean\\&quot;, but to clean it from using non-distilled water just use some vinegar concoction that works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a great facial sauna. Don&#x27;t be deterred by the cheap price, it&#x27;s certainly simple but sometimes simpler is better.</li>
    <li> Waste of money u gotta stick ur face inside .&lt;br /&gt;U get steam on ur face by warm shower better</li>
    <li> it is Better than other options available at this price. Does both job well. Quality is also good. i will recommend this.</li>
    <li> This works perfect for my needs and it is very easy to use. Yeah the top is pretty small and doesn&#x27;t fit your entire face so you have to move your face alot to get the steam to the different parts of your face. It also gets very hot so youd have to take plenty of breathers haha. I was looking at really expensive ones and thought meh, if this doesn&#x27;t work, ill get the other one but NOPE, this definitely does the job. My face feels so clean after using this.</li>
    <li> good, wish it tilted but other wise a good unit.</li>
    <li> Love my order am very please and will order from you in the future if you have something that I can use. Thank you very much</li>
    <li> expectations were surely higher than what I received...even still, can&#x27;t see this doing anything close to what it boasts. Even with a towel over the back of my head while leaning over product it was pathetic! Will be returning ASAP</li>
    <li> Disappointed this arrived in a non-working condition.  Never heated up.  Motor blown?  no clue.  Also plastic parts are of cheapest made-in-China quality.  If this thing did start up, I cannot imagine it would have lasted more than a year.  RETURNING</li>
    <li> I love this little machine.  I give myself a facial sauna once a week now, followed by a facial mask.  My skin feels much healthier.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once but it does what it says! Clears my nose and makes my skin feel moisturized. Gets a little hot so don&#x27;t put your face right in the face mask, I usually keep my face about an inch away from the edges</li>
    <li> This facial sauna is great. Works nicely for the primary reason of cosmetic use for pore steaming but also is a life saver if you suffer from severe allergies and tend to have a lot of congestion. It really helps to loosen up congestion.</li>
    <li> Sure helps with a bad case of sinuses.</li>
    <li> I found the revlon facial sauna very easy to use. It made my face feel very refreshed. I have a great facial any time I want and the first time I used the sauna, it paid for itself. What an excellent value and price!</li>
    <li> This product works great. I use to use the pot on the stove to steam my face but that was too harsh. This provides a great steam especially if you put a towel over your head while your using it. My skin has never been better!</li>
    <li> I am happy with this purchase.  It&#x27;s easy to use and I do feel it helps with opening my pores for deep cleaning.</li>
    <li> I wanted this for Christmas and got it. I used it right away and its amazing. the steam not only is so healthy for your skin, it helps sore throats, stuffy noses, the works! My face feels so clean and healthy. Im going to be telling a lot of people about this &#x3D;D</li>
    <li> I was afraid this wouldn&#x27;t get hot enough but after reading all the reviews, I decided to give it a shot.  It works just as described and I&#x27;m very pleased!  After a few minutes my face started sweating so I think it should really do the trick for cleaning pores.</li>
    <li> I use this after I was my face 3 times a week and apply moisturizer before and after using it because  I have severely dry skin. It helps tremendously.</li>
    <li> The first one I received was broken - the thing would only stay on if I pressed the button down continuously. I sent it back and was given a new one at no cost, and it seems to work just fine. It doesn&#x27;t give off as much steam as I expected, but it still seems to be enough for me. If I want more steam I just put a towel over my head like I would if I made my own steam. Overall, once it worked, it was quite nice.</li>
    <li> I have notcied a difference in my skin immediately. I have really oily skin and using the facial sauna has helped with that.</li>
    <li> The steam isn&#x27;t hot enough at all, barely warm.</li>
    <li> Like many other people on here, I received a product that didnt work. I was really disappointed, but I contacted amazon and they sent me a new one which works great.  I don&#x27;t know why they don&#x27;t test these things if everyone has problems.  One thing I wish I could change is the one bigger attachment doesnt lock into position or anything, it moves around, so be careful.</li>
    <li> I would absolutely recommend this for anyone looking for a great steamer at home use.&lt;br /&gt;A very good price too.</li>
    <li> The steam is OK and it probably take it three to four minutes to heat. The steam can last like 20 to 25 minutes. not sure it will do anything good to my skin so I just use them like once a week. I usually put on masks aftewards. So far so good. But the machine smells bad when heated, like cheap plastic.</li>
    <li> Instead of going the boiling water in pan route, I decided I wanted an actual facial steamer. This one was a fair price and the reviews were fairly good so I went for it. Of course there are smells since it&#x27;s plastic, and it bothered me a lot during my first use but has gotten less apparent with each use. I use distilled water, as recommended. The steamer gets hot in about a minute or two, and gets pretty hot, which I really like of course. It&#x27;s a very simple product, but does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> It came in flawless condition, I opened it up, read the directions, and started it up.  It took a minute or two to heat up, but when it did, it was amazing. After ONE use, my skin is smoother and looks amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is small and lightweight. At first, I thought to myself &amp;#34;Wow, this is a piece of junk&amp;#34; because of the lack of weight to the base, and the fact that one of the stoppers on the bottom came off as soon as I took the base out of the box, but it&#x27;s not junk at all and the stopper popped right back in. It works excellently. Makes skin beautiful. Ladies, if you are thinking about getting this product and your just not sure, I&#x27;m telling you, get it. It does wonders. You will not regret this purchase!</li>
    <li> Works great!  The steam it produces is great.  No too loud and at this point the steam is very consistent.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product, It take a while to get hot. You can barely see the steam. Cheap product that doesn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> This dual purpose sauna met all my expectations. It heats very well, with both the facial and the nasal guides. I am particularly pleased with the small size, making it easy to store. Good value for the money.</li>
    <li> I live in cold windy Wisconsin and find the facial sauna just the thing to hydrate my skin after a days abuse in this weather. It also has a side benefit for sinus relief.  The unit is easy to use, easy to clean and is just the right temperature.  My skin feels refreshed and looks great after every use.</li>
    <li> This facial steamer is really a good product and that too at a good price. I was surprised to see that the face steamer also has a steam regulator to adjust with your needs. The nose inhaler also work miracles in case of blocked nose.</li>
    <li> I AM SUPER PISSED.  I paid more in shipping than I did for this item (because I live in Alaska) and it won&#x27;t turn on. I wanted to return the item, but Amazon will only pay up to $5.48 for return shipping.  I wanted it right now to hopefully help with my cold, which is why I paid for faster shipping. Now I have a defective POS that does me no good at all and I&#x27;m out $50.  THANKS AMAZON.</li>
    <li> Arrived and didn&#x27;t even turn on. No steam, not heat, NOTHING.  This piece of junk is going back. Don&#x27;t bother buying this.</li>
    <li> I could easily sit away another half hour,just relaxing and enjoying it. I would recommend this Product to friends and Family. My face loves It and it really works!!!!&lt;br /&gt;PS: it great for my nose also.</li>
    <li> This product works great the heat is just right. I use it for both facial and nasal due to my allergies and it helps me.</li>
    <li> works just fine- easy to operate, well constructed, appreciate its simplicity.  using distilled water is a good idea and keeps it clean.</li>
    <li> The very first time I went to use this it wouldn&#x27;t even come on. There is loose wiring in it. The box it was shipped in was not damaged at all and neither were the other products that were shipped in the same box, which tells me it was broken when they sent it to me. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> It worked fine for me for first use and i loved it. turned off, cleaned it and put it on side. next time when i tried to use it, it wouldn&#x27;t even turn on. the switch button is not working properly. since i purchased it few months back, I can&#x27;t return it. i will try to see if I can ship it to manufacture as it has one year m.warranty.. will let u know. how it turns out.</li>
    <li> I love this. Lasted 3yrs and works very well. It is compact too so good for storage. Highly recommended and good price!</li>
    <li> Perhaps my expectations are higher, but this produced VERY little steam to me, even less than you&#x27;d get heating a pot on the stove with medium heat. The face cone also doesn&#x27;t lock into place...if you hit it by accident it&#x27;ll fall off. Sent mine back, bought a Conair.</li>
    <li> This is great! It&#x27;s inexpensive,  arrived on time,  lightweight and works great! I love using it and noticed a difference right away.</li>
    <li> Use it regularly with my weekly deep-cleansing. Its&#x27; definitely value for money.&lt;br /&gt;Although they have a lid covering the water, I&#x27;m always worried it will leak out and drop on my face lol</li>
    <li> Worked well for my sinus problem</li>
    <li> This was just ok. There was not a lot of steam that came from it and the top came off easy. It worked for cleaning my pores but I think I would possibly research this more and see what else there is to offer me.</li>
    <li> Works well for at home spa treatments</li>
    <li> I received this a few weeks. I tried to use it the first night I got it in the mail. Absolutely No power at all. It does not work.</li>
    <li> Sure, I could have just heated up water in a large bowl and wrapped a towel over my head and saved money. This is just another gadget to take up space tis why I only gave it a 4 star rating. I&#x27;ll use it but not often. It heats up pretty fast and I can&#x27;t take the heat!</li>
    <li> Works good so far it&#x27;s made with the finest materials but is proportioned to the price, so in the end is pretty good.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money...just spend some $$$ and but a good one.  I had to return!</li>
    <li> I had a salon facial and the only part I really loved was the steamer.  I use this after washing before applying a mask, and then after rinsing off the mask.  Finish with a splash of cold water to close pores and this hydrates and refreshes!  Easy to use but I would be sure to use distilled water so no minerals build up on the heating element.</li>
    <li> it is a good item.&lt;br /&gt;If you have acne, you can use it.&lt;br /&gt;After i use it , i feel dirty stuffs in my nose come out !</li>
    <li> I should have heeded the warnings - mine was broken. I would go with another make and model if I were you.</li>
    <li> well made and fast to heat up</li>
    <li> so many uses: cleaning pores to opening stuffed noses</li>
    <li> Used it last night and my face feels so soft and supple just after one use. Complexion seems brighter as well, I searched forever for a good facial sauna and I think I&#x27;ve found it. Pretty basic design, pour the water to the reservoir line with the cup and turn the machine on, took about 3-5 minutes for it to fully heat up, so not that long. The reservoir doesn&#x27;t hold much water, but you can get about 10 minutes of steam out of it, for that such a small amount. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I was good  thank you.</li>
    <li> I am a licensed esthetician and I love this! it&#x27;s a great way to get a spa quality facial at home. It heats up quickly and I use it for about 10-15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the small size because it&#x27;s easy to store underneath the bathroom sink. I prefer to use the smaller adapter because it gives concentrated steam to certain problem areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest using this steamer with your favorite cleanser, mask, toner, and moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This steamer gets hot enough to really steam your face. It feels great on a dry day and helps to open your pores for applying masks or treatments such as micro deramabrasion or peels. Helps me extract blackheads better also. The only problem I have is keeping the button on. Even in the on position the red light will go out light like there is something loose inside. If the button is on but the light isn&#x27;t then it&#x27;s not on. Not heat at all comes out of it. It can be a little touchy at times. I don&#x27;t see the need to return it if it still works, it just needs a little babying. I wonder is anyone else has had this problem too?</li>
    <li> I bought this because i wanted to see if it would help me take better care of my skin.  It is similar to the old kind that were out in the 80&#x27;s, but for some reason I remember the older ones giving off more steam than this seems too.  My daughter used and said its plenty hot, and it does work well to help deep clean the skin but i like a little more steam in my facials.  On the other hand, it was very affordable and if I really wanted more steam i should have bought the kind the aesthiticians use on a stand that shoots steam out of a wand.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom. She said she wanted to do facials at home. I hate the plastic top, it feel like it will break anytime soon. Overalls you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This has been a life saver for my sinuses. I did not buy it for that purpose but, it came in handy when I got sick. I use it before I put on a mask to open my pores too. It heats up in about 5 minutes and I use distilled water. You should always use distilled water with these machines...I don&#x27;t understand the people who use tap water...</li>
    <li> Bought item as gift for my wife, She likes it and enjoy the product whenever she gets time to use it</li>
    <li> It is a good product and does it&#x27;s job exactly as advertised. Two things I would mention to the new buyers - it takes a while to start the steam. If you are not in absolute hurry then it is not an issue. I primarily use it for sinus treatment. I wish the volume of the steam could have been little more. But the current amount of steam will be workable for most of the people.</li>
    <li> I wont give this steamer five stars because I do wish it would give out more steam but for the price it will do for now. It takes a few minutes to heat up and the steam isn&#x27;t a lot but enough. This steamer is fine if you are looking for something affordable that works. I struggle with acne and a steamer was the missing link to my skin care routine. For a long time I was using the PCA line which worked great however, due the the high price I was in search for something more affordable. By asking and through research I found the Tea tree oil line from The body shop (not super cheap but they have great online sales all the time) and OMG their products plus the steamer work like magic. I haven&#x27;t broke out in months and my face is completely clear. A steamer is a must if you have acne.</li>
    <li> I did not purchase this item for cosmetic purposes.&lt;br /&gt;Frequently, I have traceitis (inflammation of the windpipe)&lt;br /&gt;&amp; doctors at the Cleveland Clinic advised me to inhale steam&lt;br /&gt;three times a day for 15 minutes when I have an attack.&lt;br /&gt;The Revlon item does not work as well as the DeVilbis Sinusizer&lt;br /&gt;I had used for forty years. That item is no longer available,&lt;br /&gt;so I had to search for a replacement.</li>
    <li> Great item. Would definitely buy again</li>
    <li> The facial sauna is a great product and works very well. It opens the pores and makes you skin feel super clean.</li>
    <li> Sauna works well, makes a lot of steam and cleared sinuses. I would recommend to others looking for a good facial sauna.</li>
    <li> It takes a LONG time to heat up, which makes no sense as there is very little water that can be added to the heater &amp;#34;pad&amp;#34;.  Also the pink parts come off so easily and if bumped slightly by your face- there it goes!  But on the pro side, it does end up heating up, and it works long enough to get a good steam in, both for facial cleansing and when I&#x27;m feeling sick.</li>
    <li> I had a larger facial sauna that I used for cheering up my head when I had a cold. After no so many years, it failed...just plain quit.  So, thinking that all of these plug-in saunas were wretched little bits of electronic tinkering, I bought this one simply because it was the cheapest. Well, it has lasted and lasted.  And better yet, it doesn&#x27;t require a square foot of the kitchen table.  It heats up really quickly, and the cup holds the same amount of water that the larger facial saunas do.  So....such a deal.  I like it a lot</li>
    <li> Had been looking for a facial steamer to replace the Kaz unit I had used for years until it finally played out.  The Kaz produced voluminous amounts of very warm steam but apparently is no longer in production.  This unit is just &#x27;okay&#x27;.  The steam production is light but it does a fairly decent job.  It is compact and easy to clean and store.</li>
    <li> This is perfect to use for a stopped up nose, plus you get a great facial at the same time.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t get the miracle benefits from face steaming like many other commenters have gotten, which is a bummer after diligent use. But it&#x27;s more convenient than hanging your head over a pot of water when you have a cold, so even if it isn&#x27;t a miracle skin cure for you, it does have a nice backup purpose. I personally add some essential oils when I&#x27;m sick and steaming my face.</li>
    <li> I use the facial steam sauna several times a week.  It steams my whole face, or just my sinuses as needed.  It is really easy to use.  It is also inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Using it almost everyday and it is giving warm enough vapor (which I didnt find in many other facial machines). Recommend it without any reservation.</li>
    <li> I just started cleaning my face via the Oil Cleansing Method and this facial steamer has really made a world of difference in my skin and the cleansing method.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really sure if I had gotten a defective product but it barely created any steam and the plastic it was made of seemed really cheap. I&#x27;d return it but I threw away the box, stick with boiling water over a stove.</li>
    <li> it does not get hot enough to make a good steam ,it  barely  makes any steam&lt;br /&gt;wish I had not bought this product</li>
    <li> Revlon RVSP3503B1 Hot Facial Sauna did not work as well as I hoped.  Boiling water in a pot provided faster and more steaming action than this item.  I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> Produces a nice amt of steam. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> The reviews are mixed on this. I&#x27;m not sure why. If you put water in it, turn it on, and put your face over it, you&#x27;ll get water dripping down your face after a little while. It&#x27;s not like a sauna, it couldn&#x27;t be or people would burn their face. This is great, my face has already cleared up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 6-21-2015: I&#x27;ve changed my mind and going from 5 star to 3 star. It worked on my lower face and chin, but never reached my forehead. It is too small, granted I have a really big face lol. But unless you have a very small face, this will not steam the whole thing at once. I&#x27;ve gone back to putting my face over a bowl of hot water with a towel over my head.</li>
    <li> Great when you have a cold and need to breath steam to clear your head.</li>
    <li> I owned my previous facial steamer for over 20 years and finally had to replace it, and did so with this model. I have owned this model for about 3 months and have been very happy with it so far. I do hold a small towel around my face in order to get a good steam. I think the price was very good. I&#x27;d say &amp;#34;go for it!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Ordered this item for our daughter. She has problems with sinus that gives her bad headaches.&lt;br /&gt;This helps clear the sinus. She really loves it.</li>
    <li> I purchased mostly for the use of sinus problems. I find using the larger face mask is actually wonderful and works better for my needs than the smaller one. It puts out a lot of steam. I am able to actually rest my face into the cup, I don&#x27;t find it too hot. It is very lightweight, just holds a little fresh water in the tiny cup at the bottom. I can sit with it and watch TV; so it&#x27;s very convenient. Definitely worth the price thus far.</li>
    <li> Not exactly what I expected.  Works okay, but not the key to the foutain of youth as some of the reviews predicted.</li>
    <li> BLACKHEADS. STEAM WENT EVERYWHERE  EASY TO DO BUT NOT WORTH RETURNING.WILL TRY FOR FACIALS NEXT.DID NOT LOSE ALOT OF MONEY OVER IT.</li>
    <li> Not only is it good for hot facial sauna but also works great as a steam inhaler. I have sinus and it works great for me.</li>
    <li> Trying to get my teens to use this more and less of the chemical stuff to keep their skin healthy.  Steams pretty quickly and is very easy to set up.  You just need to make sure you have some place o store this thing, it takes up a good amount of space.  great steam though...heck of a lot better than using a kitchen pot and a towel.</li>
    <li> The nasal attachment was uncomfortable and i was burned several times. While facial attachment performed as advertised but the steam was often light &amp; I found myself turning my face often to catch the steam. Its okay for the price.</li>
    <li> Put a towel over your head and enjoy. I feel so much better after I use this- I can actually see the changes in my skin!</li>
    <li> I love this steamer!  Have definitely noticed an improvement in my skin since using over the past 3 months or so.  It is relaxing and leaves my skin feeling soft and clean.  I tend to follow it up with a skin clearing mask (Queen Helene Mint Julep).  I use the sauna usually once a week for approximately 15 minutes.  It is a nice treat!</li>
    <li> Great price and works great! Produces a good amount of steam and easy to disassemble for cleaning. I Definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love my facial sauna. It heats up promptly and it gets HOT! I use this on my face about twice a week - sometimes more if I&#x27;m feeling stressed. But it has done wonders for my face. I&#x27;m in my late twenties so my goal is to keep my skin looking young and fresh and this helps me achieve that look. I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Is helping with steaming my face primarily for opening pores to remove blackheads. Alot of steam and holds a good amount of quantity of water, for a longer steam session. I use it once a week consistently.</li>
    <li> Worthless product! Just received it, added water, plugged it in, turn it on and waited 30 minutes and nothing! I am returning this product.</li>
    <li> Seems to work fine.  Have used it thrice with no problems.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had a chance to use product, but once I do, I&#x27;ll be happy to send in review. I used one of these years ago and at the time was happy with the results</li>
    <li> While in Sedona, AZ this summer on vacation (at the Hilton resort) my esthetician recommend I use steam daily to clear away the oils from my clogged pores.  I hate steaming my face over a hot pan of water so I never do it.  Once I got home, I decided to try out one of these facial sauna&#x27;s.  I&#x27;ve only used it once to be honest but the experience was nice.  Not so hot that it hurt but warm enough to make me sweat and open my pores.  It felt really nice too.  All in all, this is something I plan on using on the weekends or on days I have extra time before bed.</li>
    <li> I wish I had read all the reviews before buying. It seems I am not the only who bought this steamer only to have it not even turn on.&lt;br /&gt;Very dissapointed. Also, no packing slip included in the box. I can only hope they take it back.</li>
    <li> I love this thing! I feel like the steam really gets down in my pores and just purges everything out. I also had my boyfriend use it when his nose was all stuffed up and it really cleared him. Great product for the price!</li>
    <li> Great product for this cold dry winter. Makes skin smooth</li>
    <li> I am plagued with Bronchitis during each cold spell that we get and this facial sauna is just the thing to use when I have Bronchitis. I put a few drops of Eucalyptos Oil into the water and breathe in the scented steam. It sure helps me a lot.</li>
    <li> This does the job for my weekly facial! I love the price and I&#x27;ve had it for over a year now and no complaints.</li>
