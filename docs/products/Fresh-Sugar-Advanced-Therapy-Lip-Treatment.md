      <li>It&#x27;s more like vaseline, very slick and doesn&#x27;t stay on overnight.  </li>

<ol>
    <li> Best defense for lips. Feels great, very smooth.</li>
    <li> This is one of my must have products.  It is the only thing that feels like it penetrates my chapped skin.</li>
    <li> For me, a complete waste of money. This product did absolutely nothing that was claimed. It is like a greasier, lighter form of your basic chap stick.</li>
    <li> I have really dry lips, lines and I bite my lips a lot. I have to keep my lips moisturized. This product is no better then good old fashioned Vaseline. It has a nice vanilla scent and is smooth. You have to keep reapplying it throughout the day. Not worth the money at all.</li>
    <li> Love it! Last longs and isn&#x27;t sticky.</li>
    <li> Delicious and doesnt need to be reapplied very often. Makes my lips moist and happy. Will buy this again in future.</li>
    <li> this product melts in your pocket or melts when you leave it out in the car, but other than that I like the product. It moisturizes your lips without feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> It is one of the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> This lip chap/gloss/protectant is AWESOME.  I&#x27;m spoiled for other brands now. It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but I use it every day and it lasts a long time. They&#x27;re coming out with several colors as well and they&#x27;re pretty. This clear one is great if you&#x27;re using another lipstick.</li>
    <li> Bought this based on product description to hopefully help make lips soft and help reduce wrinkles.  Used it for two weeks and found that my lips were becoming more and more chapped!  It&#x27;s more like vaseline, very slick and doesn&#x27;t stay on overnight.  Back to using my $2 Chapstick brand.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on Fresh Sugar Lip Therapy!!!</li>
    <li> I bought the travel size and it has lasted a long time, even using twice a day. Lips showed a small improvement.</li>
    <li> The VERY BEST lip treatment EVER! My lips are silky smooth now, and my husband is even using it, as it&#x27;s not a gender-related item. This product is so rich and moist, goes on so easily, and immediately my lips feel brand new. It has staying power too, as my lips feel wonderful for hours after I use it. I do tend to use it more frequently than I have to because it just glides on making lips feel wonderful. I use it over lipstick, under lipstick, it doesn&#x27;t matter, it just feels absolutely wonderful, and best of all.... IT WORKS!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Quite possibly the BEST lip treatment I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Awesome, wish it was bigger, great for travel though.</li>
    <li> Way too expensive, but a great product</li>
    <li> Over priced. And I thought I was getting the full size version of the product that I&#x27;d initially gotten at sephora. not the mini size. What a waste of packaging.</li>
    <li> This product feels very greasy to me any time I attempt to use it.  IMO it is not for day use unless you are one of those blessed girls that require no lip color!  Plus, one hour in my jean pocket made the stick a goopy mess.</li>
    <li> False advertising. Sent sample sizes of completely different product by Fresh. These are free samples given by Fresh, do not pay for these!</li>
    <li> Bought this because of another review saying that it healed peeling lips....it didn&#x27;t work for me. Seemed not to last long either.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  I&#x27;ve an awful habit of biting my lips when nervous/anxious and as such, the last few weeks have been stressful so my lips are a mess.  I bought this product for that reason and after arriving and using only a couple of days, my lips are repaired and softer than ever.  Would definitely recommend this lip therapy!</li>
    <li> Seems to be working.  Only used a week but I can see a difference</li>
    <li> I love the product but have not received my order yet!</li>
