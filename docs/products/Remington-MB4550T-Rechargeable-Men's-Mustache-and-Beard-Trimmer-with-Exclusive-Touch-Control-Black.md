      <li>Very pleased with this item.</li>
      <li>/&gt;With so many great $15-20 trimmers on the market, I&#x27;d recommend staying away from this Remington offering.</li>
      <li>And make sure you lock the touch controls while you&#x27;re shaving!</li>
      <li>Easy to operate and a great result.</li>
      <li>great product.. easy to use/</li>
      <li>very nice .. easy to operate and</li>
      <li>The USB charger is a huge plus, especially in light of this limitation.  </li>
      <li>No one will ever care about that kind of precision, except your occasion OCD person or someone who&#x27;s going to try to shave some gradient into their head (or wherever).</li>
      <li>This is Remington beard trimmer works nicely but the battery does not hold a charge.  </li>
      <li>Mine slipped off onto the floor and I took a nice swath of hair off my chin.</li>
      <li>it is a nice looking unit.</li>
      <li>But when it&#x27;s fully charged, it does produce nice results.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t buy this beard trimmer from Amazon but a review of this product is still deserving.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re like me though, this does the trick nicely.</li>
      <li>Nice job, Remington.</li>
      <li>I liked the feel of the device, and also the power settings.</li>
      <li>the best part is it charges really fast and usb</li>
      <li>it is really nice to look at.</li>
      <li>There are better devices on the market that will give you a good shave AND trim/shape your beard and mustache.  </li>
      <li>If you dont mind running this trimmer corded all the time and want to make the mistake of purchasing it thats your own choice.</li>
      <li>He is very happy with his new trimmer!</li>
      <li>/&gt;i bought a new one by Philips works awesome</li>
      <li>/&gt;The first impressions were great, it is light and feels and holds great.</li>
      <li>When it works, it is great, well worth the money.</li>
      <li>I could have taken 1 star off for Remington not including a nice carrying pouch for it as i have to keep it in the plastic, but for the price I am satisfied.</li>
      <li>To my surprise the battery was great, the controls were spot on and it was easy to setup and clean.</li>
      <li>Still pretty happy with it though</li>
      <li>The device worked great after the first charge.</li>
      <li>Buy it, cool product, it&#x27;s a good look.</li>
      <li>, it wasnt very accurate in terms of increments while adjusting but</li>
      <li>very smooth trimming...</li>
      <li>The unit is also very light in weight and ergonomic.  </li>
      <li>It fits nicely in the hand and is easy to grip without dropping it.  </li>
      <li>He really liked the touch control adjustment and found it easy to use.  </li>
      <li>The design of the device is excellent with the lockable touchpad and intuitive controls the trimmer would be one of the greatest on the market if only for its on major shortfall.</li>
      <li>-Stylish units  </li>
      <li>It cuts ok but the height and speed controls are touch screen and do not work well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not something I would spend a lot of money on, as I would go with something that has a better life and is a brand that I love.</li>
      <li>Philips Norelco QS6140/41 Styleshaver]] which has a trimmer AND a built-in foil shaver (that is much better than the Remington product I use)</li>
      <li>Most of us shave after washing our faces.</li>
      <li>This is an innovative tool.</li>
      <li>the better after 6 month dies withing seconds of on time&lt;</li>
      <li>The more I think about it, the more a battery powered trimmer makes no sense.</li>
      <li>as i have made the mistake of purchasing their products too many times..</li>
      <li>Safe even for children hair cut.</li>
      <li>Remington, how could you put your name on this and call this your top of the line product?</li>
      <li>It may be a case of marketing and sexy looks over performance and function....</li>
      <li>This is the closest he has been able to come to a barber or salon trim.</li>
      <li>Most times they don&#x27;t respond which means you can&#x27;t change the speed or cut height.</li>
      <li>Look not all trimmers on the market are bulletproof, I have a Forex BaBliss PRO trimmer which I love</li>
      <li>If you are called away, you have to turn it on, and then off, and then fiddle some more.</li>
      <li>A USB solution should have been designed with a more robust in-set connection</li>
      <li>Perhaps it is the location of the touch controls that cause many users to experience the issue?  </li>
      <li>if I want to be able to use it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s OK though because now it&#x27;s taunting the rest of my trash with</li>
      <li>you can do so much better.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never done a product review and logged on only to do this one, that&#x27;s how bad this product it.  I bought it at WalMart for 49.99.  I plugged it in, charged it up, and the next day attempted to trim my beard.  The touch screen would not work, therefore the trim guard setting (height or whatever you want to call it) could not be adjusted.  It was at the highest setting, so I couldn&#x27;t use it.  I tried performing a reset, but that did not enable the touch screen.  Finally after 3 or 4 resets I was able to adjust the Trimmer Setting.  I used the product and it worked fine.  Fast forward a few days and I used it again, this time while shaving I forgot to hit the lock button and while shaving by beard at setting 5, my thumb hit the down button and the setting lowered the guard to .8.  I had effectively shaved a strip of my beard completely off.  Fast forward another week or so and the unit would no longer adjust, it stayed on it&#x27;s lowest setting and after tons of resets and many MANY attempts, it&#x27;s never allowed me to change it.  Oh, and it&#x27;s worth mentioning that when the unit was functioning properly the battery never lasted through a full shave.  I had no receipt so I figured I&#x27;d buy another one at Walmart (it must have just been a defective unit right?), and I&#x27;ll use the new one and return the old one.  I got the new one home yesterday, took care to read the instructions more thoroughly.  Charged fully and I went to use it an hour ago....NOTHING.  The screen lights up but the unit won&#x27;t turn on.  The guard setting works, but the motor for the blades won&#x27;t turn on.  I&#x27;ve tried multiple resets and still no luck.  I&#x27;ve tried using it while plugged in, and while off the plug.  I get nothing.  I have no idea what I can now do with this product.  It&#x27;s a really styling $50.00 paper weight.  Do yourself a favor, don&#x27;t buy this.  The product is a bust.  And those that reviewed it and gave it 5 stars, I&#x27;m assuming that they just haven&#x27;t had it for very long.  Cons:  -Battery Life is poor  -Plastic Trim Guard is difficult to clean because you can&#x27;t get the unit wet and the brush doesn&#x27;t get inside.  -Touch Screen doesn&#x27;t always work  -Trimmer doesn&#x27;t always work  -If you forget to hit the lock switch (which at some point you will forget to do), you can easily make a mistake and shave a portion (or all) of your beard to long, or too short.  -Remington won&#x27;t take it back once it&#x27;s opened.  Pros:  -It&#x27;s sleek looking.</li>
    <li> UNBOXING&lt;br /&gt;On first receiving it and opening the box, I&#x27;ve found it to be rather attractive looking and has a nice high quality look and feel. I was delighted to see the micro-USB jack in the trimmer, along with a USB cable and AC adapter. That means that if you want to charge it in your car or with your laptop, you are free to do it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TRIMMING DESIGN&lt;br /&gt;I already tested the [[ASIN:B004PXIR1W Conair GMT900 iStubble Facial Trimmer, Gray]] and have been using it for a few months now. the Conair was not able to trim my upper lip near my nose -- but this Remington can and does it well. The design it very simple and effective and allows access to every tight place when doing close trimming. It also has three motor speeds, which can help for different hair types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my using it over the last week, I&#x27;ve found that it does a very good job of trimming consistently in all areas rather quickly and it is extremely easy to see exactly the area you are trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INTERFACE&lt;br /&gt;They claim this to have the \\&quot;world&#x27;s first touch interface trimmer.\\&quot; I&#x27;m not impressed. While it is fancy looking and sounding, it frustrates me like crazy because I can&#x27;t do small incremental changes on the beard length. If I want to change it from 1.4mm to 1.8mm, it moves so fast that I have to go up, down, up, down, up, down, up, down, GOT IT!! -- even if it just do the quickest, lightest touch I can manage. Maybe there is a secret to this, but it&#x27;s not in the manual. Since it is touch-based, to avoid accidental changes, there is a switch on the side to lock it. I must say that I wish the recessed buttons of the Conair GMT900 and the trimmer/comb design got together on one product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the trimmer/comb design of this is so good that I am putting up with the touch interface. If you leave it at one length all the time, it should not be a big deal for you anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[UPDATE 4/2012] After reading other reviews, I would like to report that my battery lasts me over a month with about every-other-day trimming with no recharging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[UPDATE 7/2012] After getting another trimmer, I still use this as my primary trimmer, the battery lasts over a month and it trims very efficiently. Sometimes it takes 30+ seconds to change to another length, so if they hadn&#x27;t terribly blew that and avoided the battery problems, this would be highly rated.</li>
    <li> I picked one of these up the other day and so far I love it.  The touch screen and motorized comb are awesome.  I really like all the different length settings because it can be so precise.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes cool/techy things or someone who is just in need of a good trimmer.</li>
    <li> No point in reviewing the product as a beard trimmer because the battery does not work. After a single charge it won&#x27;t work. Not even a little bit.  I wish I could tell you that the product is wonderful, but unfortunately the manufacturer created something that could not possibly function.   Giving this shaver a review would be like reviewing a new car that had a gas nozzle that was welded on; impossible.  Absolutely Worthless.</li>
    <li> I had a bad feeling about all the initial reviews of this thing. Not here on Amazon, but all the blogs and men&#x27;s magazines. The reviews all seemed far more like hype than reviews. It seemed like people were given a free product in exchange for a rushed, positive review. I waited a few weeks and bought one anyway. That was a mistake.  This product has four main flaws. I&#x27;ll list them in order of least annoying to product breaking:  1) The touch controls are too sensitive. Sure, there&#x27;s no good reason why you need 1.0 over 1.1, but good luck getting it. 0.9. 1.1. 0.8. 1.4. Jumps of 0.1 are difficult. Perhaps physical buttons would have been better than touch buttons, but that&#x27;s less buzzworthy, right?  2) There&#x27;s no way to wake the device up other than turning it on. So if you last shaved at a 1.0, but today just want to trim the sideburns, you need to turn it on, turn it off, unlock it, change the height, relock it, turn it back on. Unlocking it doesn&#x27;t wake the buttons up. For this reason they let you power it up when unlocked. Guaranteed you&#x27;ll use it while unlocked at least once and end up with a strip of your face shaved down to 0.4 before you realize. This thing should wake when unlocked and should not be able to operate while unlocked.  3) The guard isn&#x27;t removable, so it&#x27;s difficult/impossible to clean.  4) The real killer: the battery is awful. There was only one review here on Amazon badmouthing the battery when I bought it. I figured it was a fluke. It was not. The first time I charged this it worked quite well. The second time I charged it it seemed to die a bit quicker and snagged by facial hair as it did so. The next time I used the thing it died again. That was Monday. I charged it that day. I unplugged it when it said full battery. It did not turn on this morning. Worse, it takes about 5 minutes from being plugged in until you can use it, meaning it takes some charge. If you&#x27;re in a rush too bad.  I like this product well enough, as points 1-3 don&#x27;t bugme too much. But without a battery that actually works this is a horrible, overpriced device. My mother actually gave me a $10 beard trimmer for Christmas, which I returned as I had bought this a few weeks earlier. That $10 trimmer has far better reviews here on Amazon.  As I have long since thrown out the packing materials I am not sure I can return this to Amazon, but this is certainly going back somewhere. Remington, how could you put your name on this and call this your top of the line product? What brand manager said \\&quot;hey, this is good enough, rather than better engineer I&#x27;ll just ship out free ones to be reviewed a few weeks before we ship.\\&quot; Fire the guy. This razor was clearly designed to look cool, sound cool in text and be easy to hype. Usability and functionality was clearly not a priority. The focus was on getting people to buy it, not on making them enjoy using it. When companies focus on this they get a nice short term bump and then a steep fall off a cliff.  I&#x27;d never purchased a Remington product before. If this is their flagship, well, I never will again. Nor will anyone I talk to. I&#x27;m really that angry about how strong the initial campaign for this product was versus how terrible it is to use. If half the thought went into its design...</li>
    <li> While I did not purchase this product from Amazon.com, I did purchase this product and promptly returned it the following day to the store of purchase. The device worked great after the first charge. After that the display started going haywire, the lock and unlock display was switching from locked to unlocked and back very rapidly and the power charging indicator starting indicating that the device was charging when it was not plugged in. The device started emitting a high pitched squealing sound that I could not get to stop. The device would not turn off using the power button. I followed the instructions in the manual that said to reset the device, hold the power button for 8 seconds, then press the power button once and it will reset itself. However, none of these steps worked. I had to put the razor under a bowl (so I wouldn&#x27;t hear it as much) and let it scream while the battery died. Once the battery died, the device would no longer turn on or indicate that it was charging once plugged in to charge. It is officially dead less than 1 hour after opening it from the box. I will be purchasing something with higher quality components.</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what the title indicates.  The adjustment positions on the face of the trimmer are no where near the actual touch adjustments.  If I could have rated this with a zero or negative, I would have.</li>
    <li> My experience with this product is different than many others who wrote negative reviews. I found very few issues as noted by others.  The unit is generally designed well except that it is easy to mistakenly adjust the touch controls.  The unit is also very light in weight and ergonomic.  The battery lasted well in excess of a 48hr period that others have complained about, the trimmer was incredibly accurate, and it provides a very close cut for goatees (it is not intended for shaving).  The one issue I did have in common with others were the touch controls.  They were unresponsive at times, adjusted during shaving unknowingly, and simply unnecessary.  However, the controls can be locked once you set trim length.  But, you have to remember to lock it and that is another step.  I do like the tri-speed option however.  This option increases the motor speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning the unit with the included brush is not that easy (believe it or not).  The trim guard needs to be removed for a proper cleaning.  Construction of the product, while well made, will probably not allow the unit to be dropped and I suspect the product will shatter on impact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to $15 electric trimmers, I would stick with the $15 product. There is simply not enough reason to spend much more on a trimmer that does the same thing.  Next gimmick?  They will design a trimmer that will automatically update your Facebook status to indicate you just trimmed your beard and what length you chose.  How much is that worth?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***3/23/12 UPDATE***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have experienced no battery issues as other reviewers describe.  However, I found that the touch controls are now more difficult to use.  For example, it is very difficult to lock the trim guard on a specific number such as 2.0 or 3.0 (length).  In some cases it takes me 5 tries and then I give up and settle for as close as I can get to my desired setting. On the good side, the blades are still very sharp and I found the \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; mode useful in dealing with a lot of thick hair.  No pulling at all on whiskers.mode useful in dealing with a lot of thick hair.  No pulling at all on whiskers.</li>
    <li> When I had the chance to order this Remington trimmer I pulled the trigger quickly.  Maybe too quickly - after doing so, I looked at the reviews and got nervous.  The same thing happened with many similar negative reviews on the Braun Cruzer 6 (especially complaints about rechargeable battery life).  For whatever reason, I have had absolutely no battery life problems with either the Remington or the Braun.  I don&#x27;t know whether such problems were somehow addressed after the initial negative reviews, but I find it curious that my own experience with both products is so radically different.  Perhaps quality control issues early on? Anyway, this review will compare the two products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I generally trim my beard and mustache 3 - 5 times a week.  The process generally requires one repetition after brushing out stray clipped hair.  With both the Remington and Braun, I have been able to go weeks at a time without recharging - other reviewers complained they couldn&#x27;t get through a single trim without plugging in.  With the Remington, I only use the highest speed setting (really, why would anybody use a slower one - because you want it to take more time, or because you want to trim less efficiently?)  and my initial usage required a lot of motor adjustment of the comb setting (more detail on this below).  I cannot imagine my radically different experience in battery life is attributable to inadequate recharging by other users - it is not that complicated, so I can only attribute the reviewer complaints to variability in the product itself.  Maybe somebody listened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both the Remington and Braun trimmers provide excellent end results without difficulty.  At first glance, the Remington looks significantly smaller.  However the cutter surfaces are equally wide, providing equal coverage.  The Braun has a significantly larger, curved handle surface, and 2 removable adjustable combs to allow multiple users to set each one separately.  As with most trimmers, the Braun adjustments are made by physically (without motor) moving the comb up or down preset distances that cannot be altered.  The Remington has theoretically infinite settings since it moves with a continuous motor rather than mechanical presets. As other users have noted, since the setting tends to zoom past, is tricky to get the exact setting, a difficulty that does not change by using the lower motor speed settings.  It is not impossible, and if you only use one setting, it&#x27;s a minor inconvenience.  However, and this is a big point, with the Remington you really have to make sure you have locked the motor adjustment before trimming your beard.  Given the placement of the settings, if you have not locked it you are almost guaranteed to accidentally reduce the comb setting to almost 0 very quickly.  The cosmetic result will really focus your attention to this point the next time you use the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers have noted that it is impossible to remove the comb to clean out the trimmer.  In my experience, the comb loosens up with use, and after a few weeks, you should not have a problem removing it as desired.  The area immediately below the cutter is accessible by pivoting the cutting head, but I would recommend against trying to clean up that area with any regularity - no significant amount of hair accumulates there, and pivot itself is so flimsy that it will break.  However, the cutter snaps back into place without the pivot, with no loss of performance or functionality.  This is a minor physical integrity problem that should nonetheless be addressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And even more minor complaint is the packaging.  It was absurdly difficult to extricate the product from the packaging - at one point I wondered whether I was going to need an axe.  Since retailers generally want any returned product put back in the packaging, I can only say good luck with that.  Unless my shipment was atypical, most of the internal packaging will be destroyed before you can even see the whole thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I question the need for a motor driven continuously variable comb setting, but maybe some folks have more exacting \\&quot;manscaping\\&quot; needs than I do.  Overall, I found the product does what it&#x27;s supposed to, and the cosmetic differences are a matter of taste.  Some people will find the physical design of the Braun \\&quot;cooler,\\&quot; others will enjoy playing with the Remington motor driven comb.</li>
    <li> I have had a beard for over a year now and customizable length trimming is a must to stay looking sharp.  I got this because of the touch screen adjuster which can make the length between 0.4 - 18 mm and to my dismay it works only half the time.  The touch screen freezes and won&#x27;t respond for an indeterminable amount of time.  You can \\&quot;reset\\&quot; the shaver but it usually won&#x27;t work until it decides it wants to.  At the moment, mine is frozen at 0.4 mm and no matter what I do I cannot get it to move.  I hear the motor working but the length does not change.  I have had this for about 3 weeks now and I am going to buy a different shaver TODAY.  Save your money, this made in \\&quot;People&#x27;s Republic of China\\&quot; is garbage.</li>
    <li> This trimmer has never worked properly.  I returned it once but the replacement was no better.  Everyone is right about the battery life.  This timmer should be recalled.  It doesn&#x27;t charge at all.  I had to plug it in to use it, and then it took a while to recharge, even while in the socket.  Now, five months later even that doesn&#x27;t work.  The controls are difficult to use and it is too easy to slip into another mode while shaving.  Into the garbage it goes and I&#x27;ll try a Panasonic instead.</li>
    <li> Thing wont hold a charge and hasn&#x27;t for sometime...has to be used plugged in or it dies...great marketing...crap product...I pre-ordered this thing so there were no reviews when I bought...would not expect this from Remington.  Total junk.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t look at the reviews or rating until this was on the way.  I decided to put the reviews in the back of my mind and give the unit a fair shake.  The result?  Mixed, and not overly good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery is bad.  My experience isn&#x27;t as dismal as others, but it&#x27;s no where near what I expect in 2012.  I suppose if you use it like a cordless toothbrush (use cordless but charge when not using), it&#x27;s fine. The USB charger is a huge plus, especially in light of this limitation.  Then again, my other trimmers can go quite a few uses without a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave is OK.  It&#x27;s not top notch or even a notch below that.  It&#x27;s a bit harsh, way too quick to adjust the guard, and is a pain to clean.  Really these are bigger issues than the battery.  (I&#x27;d give it at least 3 stars if it worked well as a shaver).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gimicks--oh my!  Here&#x27;s where the unit shines in its aspirations but crashes with poor execution.  The poor shaving performance is due largely to it&#x27;s touch controls and power guard.  Two features I never knew I wanted (and now kinda know I don&#x27;t want).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;look elsewhere!</li>
    <li> I should start off by stating that I&#x27;m not hard to please. If your product does what it states then I&#x27;m satisfied. I rarely nitpick on anything not pertaining to music or movies. So, when I got the Remington beard trimmer all I was looking to do with it was trim my beard. Did I care that it was all touch based? Not really, no. It&#x27;s cool, I feel like I&#x27;m trimming my beard in the future, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting perfection by any means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My point is, this touch model offered by Remington does what it sets out to do...trim beards. Is the battery long lasting? It&#x27;s not terrible. Does it do a good job trimming? Yes. I have not one complaint about that. It doesn&#x27;t pull or tug even when I&#x27;m at my bushiest. When all is said and done, it&#x27;s all about preference. If you want one with a long lasting battery you should look elsewhere. With the touch you&#x27;re bound to lose some battery life. If you&#x27;re like me though, this does the trick nicely.</li>
    <li> I wanted this product to work.  The first one I received didn&#x27;t work because the trim adjuster kept on going up and down by itself so I returned it for a replacement.  The second one I received didn&#x27;t respond to the buttons at all and did what ever it wanted.  terrible product.</li>
    <li> This looks like a very nice design and I was attracted by the touch height setting system&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after experiencing early problems where the shaver would switch itself on ( yes, really) and charging issues, the product is now completely unusual 6 months after purchase&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem seems to relate to the height indicator which shows only very high or very low numbers. Additionally, the guard movement seems unstable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also like to echo earlier comments that, even when working correctly, it is very hard to set on a  particular number&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in a developing country and I am currently struggling to get local service&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend this model</li>
    <li> I bought the MB4550 sometime in November. The battery life has never been good, always dying without warning in the middle of a shave.  It has since gotten from bad to worse, now dying off after just one short session of about 5-10 minutes. I practically need to keep it plugged in to complete a shave now.  In late December, I attempted to leave a review on Remington&#x27;s site about its poor battery life. My review was rejected without offering any reason, except to ask me to follow their website guidelines (which I did not breach, unless they had a hidden one about no-poor-reviews). Worse, no one from Remington bothered contacting me about the issue after rejecting the review. I sent a support request in early January and did not hear from these guys either.  Pretty sure this trimmer is the first and last ever product I&#x27;d buy from Remington. Now to go through the trouble of returning the product.</li>
    <li> I purchased the trimmer about three months ago and use it every 5-7 days to trim my beard down low. I liked the feel of the device, and also the power settings. I was also excited about being able to travel with the trimmer and just charge it from my laptop without needing to carry yet another charger cable and plug.  However, the trimmer has two major flaws:  1. Very poor battery life. To clarify, after just a few short months the trimmer will not hold enough charge to perform a single shave of a few days beard growth. The device says the the battery is full when started but I imagine that it is not holding more than 20% of its original capacity.  2. Difficult to clean. The trimmer guard can be removed with a little force but obviously is not designed to be. Unfortunately, that is by far the easiest way to clean it, otherwise hair gets caught between the guard and the blades fairly quickly and is difficult to remove.  Overall, I&#x27;m not impressed with this trimmer and will be looking for a replacement.</li>
    <li> This is a fine little trimmer!  It fits nicely in the hand and is easy to grip without dropping it.  It is loaded with features, not the least of which is a long battery life.  My previous Remington would last for one trim, then it had to be recharged.  This one has done three trims over a space of three weeks, all on one 90 minute charge!  The charger is easy to use, being a fairly standard micro USB port, but it is a little stiff to insert.  This is likely due to the fact that you don&#x27;t want it slipping out if you shave while plugged in.  It also comes with a micro to standard USB cord, so you can charge it from your laptop while on the road (but you CANNOT shave while plugged into the laptop).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The controls are simple, if a bit touchy.  It has touch controls for beard length and blade speed (although I cannot see why you would turn the speed down).  Even at the highest speed, it is quieter than my other Remington.  As for length, you have very precise settings, but it is hard to get it right on, say \\&quot;3\\&quot; for a length.  This isn&#x27;t really a problem, as 2.9-3.1 is basically the same.  Once you set it, you should slide the lockout switch to keep it from adjusting while you are shaving (if you accidentally touch the controls).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trim is excellent, requiring only one to two passes without leaving long hairs behind.  The comb does catch on your lip from time to time, but they all seem to do that.  Cleaning is easy too, as the blade just pops off (it doesn&#x27;t swivel like many, so don&#x27;t drop it into the sink the first time you pop it off!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely the best trimmer I have bought.  I am very happy with this one!</li>
    <li> I had been using for a while now the Remington HC5350 hair clipper to trim my beard, until I was offered the MB4550, which is actually designed to do what I was doing. I placed the order for it and was really excited when I got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first impressions were great, it is light and feels and holds great. While I believe the touch controls are a little excessive in a product like this (a simple manual switch could have done the same) it is really nice to look at. The touch controls are used to determine the size in millimeters you need for your beard or moustache, once selected there is a touch lock on the left size of the device that strongly suggest you use so you don&#x27;t accidentally change the size with the touch controls being so sensitive. There is a &#x27;Tri-Speed&#x27; button that can be used to increase/reduce the motor speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very happy with it as it works great for my needs, the results were way better than the ones I had with the HC5350, a closer trim. Bear in mind this is intended to be a trimmer and not a shaver, the smaller size available will not do a perfect shave if that is what you need. I loved the fact that it can be charged via USB or by plugging it to a power outlet, which makes it ideal for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I missed the fact though that I could wash my old HC5350, the MB4550 is not washable and has to be cleaned with the supplied brush, which can be difficult if you do not want to remove the motorized comb. And then, after a couple times using it, the battery ran out. At first I thought I probably hadn&#x27;t charged the battery long enough and recharged it, same thing. By googling this problem, I came across other Amazon reviewers having the exact same issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really is a great product in my opinion but a bad battery is what I would consider a huge flaw, I would advise you to plug the device to an outlet while using it but the user guide makes it clear that &#x27;it is advisable not to use this trimmer directly from the power outlet when it has been fully charged&#x27; unless there is a drop in power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is with mixed feelings that I decided to give this product 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: Right after this review was written I recharged the battery for a second time, and the problem was gone! it lasted so much longer  (a couple weeks using it daily in the morning), I did not immediately update my review as I wanted to give it more time to test it and see if the problem with the battery was in fact resolved. So far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would seem as if whatever the problem was it was related to the first recharge of the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am quite happy now with this product that I decided to raise its rating to a fourth star, the problem adjusting the right size with the highly sensitive touch buttons still bugs me and is the reason why this is not a five star review.r outlet when it has been fully charged&#x27; unless there is a drop in power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is with mixed feelings that I decided to give this product 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: Right after this review was written I recharged the battery for a second time, and the problem was gone! it lasted so much longer  (a couple weeks using it daily in the morning), I did not immediately update my review as I wanted to give it more time to test it and see if the problem with the battery was in fact resolved.

    <li> Horrible product....the touch screen is out of wack..it doesnt work..and I have only used it once so far...first week using it..and it has already stopped working on me completely and does not hold a charge. horrible horrible horrible.</li>
    <li> I have ti just echo what so many other reviewers have said about this product: the charger is useless, the controls are all useless, and really there is just no reason to purchase this trimmer, as it is inconvenient and not at all useful. Remington has a good name but they flopped on this one item.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a beard for about 6 years and was excited to try out this trimmer. I&#x27;ve been using the Norelco vacuum trimmer for a couple years and wanted to try something new. Unfortunately this trimmer is very poorly designed. The touch interface sometimes works, sometimes doesn&#x27;t. It claims you can adjust the length by .1 mm but the touch controls are so sensitive it usually adjusts by at least .5mm at a time. The manual says to try and reset the trimmer if it&#x27;s overly sensitive - I did, and nothing changed. And make sure you lock the touch controls while you&#x27;re shaving! I forgot to lock it while testing it out and my 7mm setting quickly dropped down to .4mm and made a nice strip down my chin. Pretty sweet...  The big thing that bothered me was that the plastic guard could not come off the unit to clean. And since you cant get this thing wet you can only try and clean it the best you can with one of those little brushes which can only get you so far. After a while it&#x27;s going to get pretty nasty in there. Plus, I&#x27;m so used to my Norelco vacuum shaver I forgot what a huge mess the sink can become after using a regular shaver.   I will say that the actual blade was pretty sharp and did a nice job cutting through my thick beard. It&#x27;s too bad that everything else sucks about it. I&#x27;ll stick with my Norelco for now.</li>
    <li> From the first week I started using this I only got a couple minutes of battery life.  It didn&#x27;t bother me that much because I have no problem using it plugged in.  Well, a couple months later, I have no battery life, even when plugged in, so this thing is useless to me.  I have followed the charging instructions exactly (no that complicated).  Flawed product design.  DO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, all of the buzz--pardon the pun--about this trimmer was all just overblown hype by blogs most likely paid to promote it. The problem: the touch control only works about 50% of the time; it gets stuck at a length and then touching the control only changes the motor speed (which has a dedicated touch control of its own). There is a reset procedure that fixes the issue most of the time; however, it requires letting the unit sit idle for a short while and I am not enthused about the disruption to my morning ritual. Perhaps this is a defective unit, but judging by other reviews here, it is a very common defect, so Remington needs to invest in more quality control. I&#x27;m returning this trimmer and will give a Braun a shot.</li>
    <li> the better after 6 month dies withing seconds of on time&lt;br /&gt;rms did not help&lt;br /&gt;i bought a new one by Philips works awesome</li>
    <li> This is the most promising and yet worst delivering beard trimmer I have ever owned, and I have owned way more trimmers than I care to admit.  It absolutely can not hold a charge over 1 trimming worth of use, the touch screen goes from not registering my touches, to registering phantom touches, to registering the incorrect touches.  I can touch the speed adjustment and raise the guard length, or touch the guard length adjustments and alter the speed of the trimmer.  Sometimes I have to actually press on the display portion of the trimmer to lower the guard.  It is an absolute disgrace of product design.  Sure a touch screen sounds fancy and looks slick, but if it can not perform a single function properly then what is the use?  Half the time when I turn off the touchscreen lock it starts adjusting itself before I come anywhere near touching the \\&quot;buttons\\&quot;. I have tried cleaning the screen with a towel before each use, brushing all of the loose hair off that I can find, and nothing ever really fixes the problems.  I have not gotten it near any water, I don&#x27;t use it with a wet beard or wet hands, as they were very explicit that it is NOT water proof/resistant/friendly, and yet it still hates everything I do. Complete disappointment.  I have gone through 4 complete charging sessions with this trimmer, and after it registers a full charge, I go off and trim my beard a bit, say 5 minutes of use to be generous.  From there I stick it in a drawer, with the lock on, and come back a max of two days later and it is completely dead from the get go.  This has happened 4 times, exactly the same each time.  What is wrong here?  You can not tell me that I need to charge this thing between each trimming session, that is absolutely unreasonable.  Pros are that when it works, it does a decent job.    Cons are that it almost never works properly and cant hold a charge whatsoever.  I would absolutely not recommend anyone to purchase this trimmer without it getting a significant design overhaul.  In its current state it is a total waste of money.</li>
    <li> Short answer: Get something else, this is the \\&quot;Sharper Image\\&quot; version of a beard trimmer, flashy but ultimately useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long answer: Get something else.  You don&#x27;t need a backlit LCD display with capacitive buttons and a motorized guard to cut your beard, especially when the performance of the cut is no better than your average 10-20 dollar beard trimmer, assuming the battery even lasts through a whole trime.  3-motor speeds might be useful somehow (probably just there to improve the poor battery life), but I can&#x27;t imagine not just using it on high the whole time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only unique thing about this that might be useful to someone who travels a lot is it charges through a standard mini-USB port, like most modern (non-apple) smartphones, so that&#x27;s one less special charger to carry with you.  I think it&#x27;d make more sense to get a simpler trimmer with a much stronger battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other words: get something else.</li>
    <li> Yes, the battery life is horrible. But other than that, I like the trimmer. Not love, like. It does the job that you want it to do, but you do have to watch the battery. Maybe it&#x27;s the touch that sucks the battery. It&#x27;s not something I would spend a lot of money on, as I would go with something that has a better life and is a brand that I love.</li>
    <li> The world&#x27;s first touch interface trimmer has already retired the trophy as the world&#x27;s WORST touch interface trimmer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t understand how such a thing could get past quality control!  The fatal flaw?  It gives you the choice of every single tenth of a millimeter of beard length between 0.4 mm and 18.0 mm, and then makes it IMPOSSIBLE to select the precise length you want!  What is needed here is a two-position arrow button: one touch should advance it 1/10 of a millimeter, holding it down should advance it until you release it or hit the limit.  That first function is what is missing here; excepting the limit lengths of 0.4 mm and 18.0 mm it is virtually impossible to select any other length precisely because you will blow right past it in either direction no matter how lightly you touch the button.  It does have a touch lock button so that if you have patience enough to persist in fiddling with it long enough (and are lucky enough) to accidentally hit upon the correct length setting, you may lock it in,...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and if you value your sanity, you will never unlock it again as long as you own it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Presumably Remington will eventually fix this (because no one would DESIGN it to \\&quot;work\\&quot; this way), but until they do it is practically worthless, an absolute DO NOT BUY! Try an adjustable trimmer you can actually adjust instead: [[ASIN:B001GQ3GEY Wahl Lithium Ion All In One Trimmer]].  With its six-position trimmer guide and 3 fixed-length attachment combs it gives you far fewer choices for beard length, but at least you can have some confidence in being able to select the length you actually want within a finite period of time!</li>
    <li> Pros:  -Stylish units  -Lightweight  -Easy to use/clean  Cons:  -Battery life is non existent  -Doesn&#x27;t get nearly as close a shave as the top models do  -Touch controls are finicky.</li>
    <li> This is Remington beard trimmer works nicely but the battery does not hold a charge.  I charged it for the recommended time.  It worked for the first trim but when I went to use it for the second time it did not work.  I even charged it overnight.  Do not buy this trimmer.  Also it does not even work when plugged in.  TOTAL PIECE OF JUNK I AM GOING TO RETURN IT ASAP.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband, so the review is based off of his experiences, not mine.  We thought this would be a cool upgrade from his cheapo trimmer. We liked that it was wireless and thought it was cool that it can be charged on a laptop with a USB cord.. but when you really think about it.. why would you ever do that?  Anyway, it was still pretty cool in a novel kind of way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of using interchangeable guide combs for length, it has a high tech touch control unlike anything I&#x27;ve ever seen before.  Use the touch control to automatically move the blades up or down to adjust for desired length.  It also has a touch control for different power levels.  So my husband went to try it out.  The first thing he noticed was that it simply doesn&#x27;t trim unless it&#x27;s on the highest power setting, so forget about using a different power setting. The other thing is, the trimmer clogs constantly and painfully tugs and pulls at hair. You can&#x27;t quite see it in the picture, but the trimmer has a built on guide comb, which is awkwardly designed.  It&#x27;s square shaped with 90 degree angles which make it difficult to maneuver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;coolness\\&quot; of this trimmer made my husband want to keep using it, but after two times, he abandoned it for his old trimmer.</li>
    <li> The trimmer itself does a good job but the battery is very poor. Even after a complete full charge, I can&#x27;t trim my gottee before the battery runs out. I have gone through the full charge and try to do a trim at least 5 times and have never made it yet. Remmington has a policy of not taking anything back unless it has not been taken out of the package and used. How am I supposed to find out if it works without taking it out of the package? This is the second Remmington product I have purchased over the years and both have been very poor. No more Remmington for me!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used an older Remington beard trimmer for a while and have been moderately pleased with it. So I was excited to try the new touch MB4550 trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I&#x27;m not experiencing quite the same battery problems as other reviewers. While I do not need to have the razor plugged in while using it, it doesn&#x27;t hold quite the charge you&#x27;d expect from a new trimmer. After the first trim, it seemed its power diminished. After 6 trims, there was little power left. This is obviously a problem with this trimmer, and I hope Remington fixes this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complaint is the touch screen. It is WAY too sensitive! You can barely touch the arrow up, and it shoots up by 2-3 mm! It took me FOREVER to actually get to the setting I wanted to get to. And then I accidentally hit the button and changed it, and it took me a while to get back to where I was!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice is - once you find the setting you like, hit the LOCK button on the side and never, ever change it again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The settings on this trimmer are far different than the older Remington I use. I normally used a 4 mm on the older one. I set this new one to 4, and it trimmed off most of my beard! So I have to set this on 5.5 mm. I can&#x27;t quite explain the discrepancy in the measurement, but it was frustrating to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer comes with a USB cable, and I&#x27;m not sure why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also quite difficult to clean, and I find tiny little hairs all over my sink constantly. But when it&#x27;s fully charged, it does produce nice results. It&#x27;s just frustrating to use.</li>
    <li> Seriously, If I could give this 0 stars I would.  I received one of these for Christmas and it stopped holding a charge in January.  By that I mean it absolutely wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge at all.  It became a corded trimmer. I&#x27;d leave it to charge overnight and the next day I&#x27;d unplug it.  It would run for maybe 20 seconds and then the battery would die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terrible device, avoid at all costs.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t buy it!! I buy it at walmart about a month ago and the battery its so poor, and the worst... you cant use the trimmer wile charging!</li>
    <li> I can vouch for the low-star reviews here. This product should not be available as it  simply does not work. It is aesthetically pleasing and feels sturdy, but those are the only positive experience I have had with the beard trimmer. There are three assignments for the touch controls: Up arrow, Down arrow, and a circular symbol which changes the speed of the blade. Good luck trying to figure out where to press. I found the trimmer absolutely unresponsive and had to press random points located on the trimmer to actually get it to work. When you do find these pressure spots, it is impossible to get the exact increment in length for the trimmer. For instance, starting from 2.0mm, if i wanted the desired length to be 3.2mm, it would always miss that exact increment and go over to say, 3.4mm. The same problem would occur going down as well. This product cannot hold a charge either. There is no point of trying to be progressive and including a USB charger if it dies almost immediately. Great idea, but it is overshadowed by the fact that nothing works correctly. I find it extremely suspicious this product received positive reviews.</li>
    <li> I was... pretty excited about this product.  It was so cool how it electronically moves the attachment and speed.  However, be sure to lock it every time or you will accidentally cut off one side of your mustache.  That is not why only 1 star.  After about 2 uses, the attachment stopped working.  It is now stuck at the option of .4 mm.  I still use it to get that scruffy look but its not going to last too long.  I still use and like my original Remington PG-400 All in one shaver (no longer available - bought over 3 years ago which is a very good lifespan compared to this trimmer).  This touch control trimmer has potential but since its the first that I&#x27;ve seen on the market, I consider it a beta product and they need to re-think this idea...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  It randomly started to work again.  I will keep track of how long it lasts this time and post when it dies...</li>
    <li> Run like the wind. This is the worst trimmer ever. It doesn&#x27;t hold the charge well and that makes for a painful experience. Take it from my experience...you can do so much better. I recommend the [[ASIN:B00009RF1E Wahl 9918-6171 Groomsman Beard and Mustache Trimmer]] instead.</li>
    <li> selller was great just the product wasnt the best at all. It was on a sealed package but it kept getting jammed if you would forget to lock the adjustment button as you would be trimming the cutting blade would move up and down.</li>
    <li> My husband was all too willing to try this cool looking Remington trimmer, but when he kept fumbling with the touch control to adjust the height, he gave up.  Perhaps it is the location of the touch controls that cause many users to experience the issue?  If most users are like my spouse, they will not be patient enough to figure out how to hold the trimmer in order to make it work to its potential.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a positive note, the battery seemed to be OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, 3 stars because of the touch controls.</li>
    <li> I bought this product in January, and have used it 3 times and it&#x27;s officially broken. The touchscreen interface is really nice, but it&#x27;s flawed. When using the up and down arrows for increment increases the actual head of the razor is too slow to respond. Mine is currently stuck at 0 but it reads 7 mm, in turn I accedently cut my entire beard off. The charge, after 3 uses is terrible. The charge last maybe 3-5 minutes. I would recommend another beard trimmer, Iam currently looking on Amazon for a replacement.</li>
    <li> I was deeply disappointed in this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an important precaution, not unique to this product, be careful trimming bodily hair in sensitive regions. As with all electric trimmers, cuts are a possibility. Trust me on this one. &lt;Ouch&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, an adjustable length trimmer is hardly new, so the only two things going for this one (besides it&#x27;s brand, which I will now question every time I see it) was the fact that you could touch adjust the length setting and the digital readout. If these two features fail, the product is a disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The touchy-adjust length thing was a failure from the start. First, 175 settings is ridiculous. It adjusts in 0.1 mm increments. (For those who only know Imperial units, 0.1 mm is 0.004 of an inch. Yeah, that seems dumb just saying it, which is why they only included a Metric measurement...where English and American users will look at it and say, \\&quot;Hey, that&#x27;s a lot of difference!\\&quot; No, it really isn&#x27;t. That&#x27;s the manufacturer being stupid.) No one will ever care about that kind of precision, except your occasion OCD person or someone who&#x27;s going to try to shave some gradient into their head (or wherever). The former I feel sorry for, because it is virtually impossible to get this to actually adjust in 0.1 mm increments when you touch it. Instead, it adjusts in 0.2 to 0.3 mm increments.  To actually get it to adjust to that length, you have to fiddle with it. And you CAN&#x27;T DO SO until you turn it on and then off again, where you get around ten seconds to start fiddling. If you are called away, you have to turn it on, and then off, and then fiddle some more. It&#x27;s a battle to get it set where you want it. And if you complete this battle and then are somehow foolish enough not to LOCK IT IN PLACE, you have the joy of hearing a little &#x27;beep&#x27; and the knowledge of knowing that you&#x27;ve just shaved your head (or whatever) to two different lengths. Because those little buttons are RIGHT where a normal person puts their hand. Cute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those trying to shave designs into their head (or ...) at 175 different levels, go nuts. This is the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the little digital adjustment readout thingy. This part goes hand in hand with the other part, being able to adjust it. Because if you can&#x27;t tell what the length is, it&#x27;s not really adjustable, is it? You&#x27;re blindly guessing how much hair you&#x27;re leaving behind. Have fun with that. And that&#x27;s PRECISELY the part that broke when I used this for the third time. Now mine reads either 0.4 mm (the minimum) or 18 mm (the maximum). Anywhere in between, it will still read whichever was the last edge (i.e., if I put it all the way down to 0.4 mm, it stays at that until I get it all the way back to 18 mm.) Which means, really, that I have an electric trimmer that now has two settings (0.4 mm and 18 mm). As a bonus, if I accidentally click the lock off, it can adjust and suddenly be at a different, mystery setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh boy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harkius</li>
    <li> My husband has used the trimmer several times now and I am extremely pleased with the results.  His beard and mustache have come out looking very nice and even.  He really liked the touch control adjustment and found it easy to use.  And as I said, I really like the great look he has accomplished with it.  This is the closest he has been able to come to a barber or salon trim.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this beard trimmer from Amazon but a review of this product is still deserving. All I would say is this trimmer has so many design flaws that I&#x27;m shocked they would even market this and sell it for the asking price. It didn&#x27;t hold a charge lasting more than 3 minutes. It&#x27;s difficult to adjust the trimming attactment. The motor is very loud and not consistant in speed. It&#x27;s difficult to clean the trimmer head. It has a locking switch for the trimmer setting but none for the On and Off button. I put the unit in a travel pouch and it must have pressed against a can of shaving cream and when I took it out for use the battery was completely dead. Using with the power cord you can&#x27;t adjust the trimmer settings. You must have it adjusted with battery use but what good is that when it won&#x27;t hold a charge. Holding the unit while trimming your beard feels a little slippery due to it high gloss exterior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was packaged very nice and it appeared to be a good buy. Someone in quality control forgot to test this unit for long term use because if you buy this it won&#x27;t last very long. I threw mine in the trash and will take the loss on this one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d purchased this item originally from Remington directly, charged it, but did not use it for at least two weeks.  Subsequent charges lasted for increasingly abbreviated durations, to the point which an hour was long enough for the battery to drain fully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully Remington warranties these for two years, and returning the shaver resulted in a new (or at least re-stickered) replacement which is working much better and more consistently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent features and adjustments, wise use of micro-USB for the charger, and the longer warranty have kept me from considering replacements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poor battery history with myself and others makes me hope they&#x27;ve addressed the problem with replacements.</li>
    <li> I bought this for it&#x27;s precise length-control, which I have been looking for a long time. First mistake, yes you can set length to 1/10th of a mm, but if you press to hard while trimming, it will change, actually resulting in a closer shave then wanted.&lt;br /&gt;The glide-head is quite uncomfortable, the edge is quite sharp, specially when trimming the upper-lip. Never had this issue with Braun or Philips...&lt;br /&gt;Then the touch control, as stated by others, very sensitive, and while there is a lock-switch, it does not consistantly work, so again, while using it, you could change the speed, or worse, the length.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the battery is USELESS. After fully charging it, didn&#x27;t use it for two days, but when I needed it, battery had already run down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anything positive? NO...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;STAY AWAY FROM THIS CRAP!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t get to use it once before it broke on me. The touch feature is too sensitive the numbers move up and down sporadically. I wouldn&#x27;t trust using it on my face. Perhaps they should test these things before they sell them. I was looking forward to a precise shave but so much for that.</li>
    <li> I just finished a week of using a [[ASIN:B007VB50VA Philips Norelco QS6140/41 Styleshaver]] and have found it vastly superior to the Remington MB4550T. I have used the MB4550T for several months now, and while it did its job (kind of) I have grown tired of its problems which include:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 - The electronic controls are problematic and I have had to reboot my shaver on multiple occasions to get it working again. Think about that - I have to REBOOT a shaving device. That&#x27;s a bridge too far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 - The instructions caution you to NOT GET THIS DEVICE WET. Think about that for a second - you shave in your bathroom where you are surrounded by water hazards. Most of us shave after washing our faces. The water restriction has been an inconvenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 - Fragility - if you drop this device, or bang it slightly, you pretty mush have to throw it in the trash. It is very sensitive to any sort of force.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it works, it works well. It provides a range of trimming lengths that it probably superior to any other product on the market. You can go from George Clooney in Oceans 11 to Clooney in Syriana without a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compare that with the [[ASIN:B007VB50VA Philips Norelco QS6140/41 Styleshaver]] which has a trimmer AND a built-in foil shaver (that is much better than the Remington product I use) and it&#x27;s an easy choice. Buy the Philips. The Philips has a mechanical adjustment dial on its trimmer side and you won&#x27;t get the same .1mm adjustment increment, but it is more reliable and produces comparable trimming results.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this trimmer because the last Remington shaver I bought lasted around 8 years.  This one is not worth $15 much less the $38 it goes for now and certainly not the $50 I paid for it when it first came out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has 2 significant flaws:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 - Just like everyone else has stated, the battery life is pathetic. I have to keep it plugged in the entire time I use it which defeats the purpose of an electric shaver obviously.  If I take it off the charger, it lasts maybe 25 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 - The legthening/shortening touch controls quit working around the 3rd month I had it. When I first purchased this product, I used it to cut my 4 year old son&#x27;s hair as well.  I was very happy that we didn&#x27;t have to waste money at a barber shop anymore.  However, even though the blade speed funtction still works, the sensors that control the position of the blade have died on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the worst purchases I&#x27;ve made in a long time. DO NOT waste your money.</li>
    <li> Performs as expected, no issues so far.</li>
    <li> Do not buy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Screen turns on all the time draining the battery. Next to that after a full battery charge I could only use it for like 1 minute and it went dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Returned it already.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m now on my second Remington shaver.  The first one had problems within the first week of use.  It would suddenly decide to quit taking inputs from the touch screen.  Then after resetting it it would work but develop the same symptoms.  Eventually the motorized guard would move on its own resulting in half my face shaved shorter than the other (thanks).  Lastly it quit holding a charge and would stop in the middle of the 2nd shave after a full charge.  I didn&#x27;t buy the product on Amazon so I had to go back to Remington for a replacement.  They sent me a new unit a week later with little questioning which was the only good thing about their company.  Now that I&#x27;m on my second unit it has the same battery lift issues but has gotten to the point of being worst than the first.  Now I cannot use it unless it&#x27;s plugged into the wall.  So now my options are to keep going back to their warranty department for replacements or purchase a new product from a different vendor.  I&#x27;m going the later route because even though it hasn&#x27;t cost me anything in shipping to get replacements I don&#x27;t know if I can keep my sanity every morning with this inferior product and having to wait on replacements.  Eventually the year warranty will run out and I&#x27;ll be forced to buy a new unit anyways.  Stay away from this product--judging from the other reviews on here and my experience it would seem like the product is fundamentally flawed.</li>
    <li> *UPDATE*&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if the short battery life was just a new battery getting a few charges or not, but now I&#x27;m quite impressed with the battery life of the trimmer.  It last quite a long time and I can take it on the road for a week without having to worry about recharging.  Just wanted to update my previous review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I agree that the battery life is dismal.  The first time I used the trimmer, I fully charged it and could not get through a complete shave without plugging in the device.  I do think the trimmer does a good job at giving you a relatively close TRIM, not shave, but TRIM.  It will never replace a true shaving device, but if you are the type that prefers the \\&quot;5 O&#x27;Clock Shadow\\&quot; look, then the Remington trimmer is worth a look.  If you are looking for a device that will trim your beard or mustache at various lengths, this device may work for you.  It is NOT a good device for a close shave, nor should it be used to edge your mustache or beard.  You can try to do it if you wish, but proceed with caution.  There are better devices on the market that will give you a good shave AND trim/shape your beard and mustache.  The Remington is not yet in the league of these devices.</li>
    <li> I purchased one of these from WalMart about 6 months ago.  The touch control is so bad that the settings are nearly impossible to control.  When you touch the up arrow, the plastic height selector goes all the way up.  The same happens when you touch the down arrow.  The plastic height selector goes all the way down.  The only way to \\&quot;control\\&quot; the height is to quickly press the lock button when it is changing height and hope you get the right height.  The battery life is pittiful that I need to plug it into the AC adapter to use it.  So much for having a battery.  Bottom line, don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
    <li> My husband gave this Remington trimmer a try, but we&#x27;re sticking with his $15 trimmer.  The Remington Touch Control trimmer needs to go back to the drawing board.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery isn&#x27;t the greatest - if going on a weekend trip you definitely will need to bring a charger with you.  The touch control is gimmicky and doesn&#x27;t work, it&#x27;s a pain in the patootie to change the lengths.  The touch control needs to be replaced with a tried-and-true manual control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With so many great $15-20 trimmers on the market, I&#x27;d recommend staying away from this Remington offering.</li>
    <li> Horrible product! Had I not used it, I would have returned it. The first couple uses it worked fine. But with weekly use requiring cleaning, and removing the plastic guard each time, the arms of the guard become stretched and therefore will not grip the lock supports they are supposed to, and without immediately knowing, you think you have your guard set at 5.5, when in fact it has slid all the way down to 0.5! It is going in the trash.</li>
    <li> In the 6 months I&#x27;ve owned this, I think I&#x27;ve probably attempted to use it about 15 times; of those attempts, I&#x27;ve had one success. Here are all of the issues I can remember:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) You can&#x27;t use it while it&#x27;s plugged in. This wouldn&#x27;t be such a huge deal on its own, but combined with #2, its a bit of a doosie.&lt;br /&gt;2) It doesn&#x27;t charge very well. At first, I plugged it in the night before I wanted to trim, but in the morning, it would run out of juice after about 15 seconds of use. So then I started leaving it plugged in all the time, and it stopped working altogether. I don&#x27;t know if it failing was a direct result of it being plugged in all the time, but those are really the only two options and neither worked.&lt;br /&gt;3) Adjusting it to the correct height sucks. This has been said in other reviews, but it is impossible to select a specific height without a lot of patience. When you want it to skip ahead fast, its slow, and just when you get close to where you want to be, it zooms off to 18mm.&lt;br /&gt;4) Not so good with the cutting. Other reviewers picked this one up as well, but it has a tendency to grab hairs, which, for a device designed for the sole purpose of cutting said hairs, is disappointing. It doesn&#x27;t happen all the time, but when it does you will know immediately.&lt;br /&gt;5) Having a touch screen and non-removable battery means not having to reboot. The last time I tried to use it, the trimmer decided it was going to lock up hard. I tried all of the reset tricks I could find, and no joy. The device just sat there, every element in the screen lit up, as if taunting me while I trimmed with scissors. It&#x27;s OK though because now it&#x27;s taunting the rest of my trash with it&#x27;s LED screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you&#x27;re thinking about it, wait a year or two. None of these problems are particularly rare in first generation devices (battery life, poor UI, extra \\&quot;features\\&quot; at the expense of core function) and hopefully by then Remington will have released a few editions and had a chance to engineer out most of the more common bugs. Its just disappointing that after all of the first generation devices, no one seems to be learning.</li>
    <li> Buyer beware...Do not purchase this product.  I purchased this trimmer as a replacement for my other Remington beard trimmer.  Remington has a solid track record, however this product is a massive fail.  1) Battery life is lacking.  After initial charge the internal battery held long enough for one trim. 2) Guard carriage would prevent from receiving a skin tight trim.  For those who value a shorter trim this product failed. 3) The same carriage is permanently affixed thus preventing cleaning and maintenance of the blades themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately this product must have been designed by either women or hairless geeks without beards.</li>
    <li> Horrible experience, I&#x27;ve replaced this 3 times and give up, I just through them all in the garbage.  Doesn&#x27;t hold charge and the controls don&#x27;t work which was the main reason why i bought it.</li>
    <li> Nice concept, horrible execution. Never worked for more than ten minutes. Won&#x27;t stay charged. Controls changing randomly all over the place. Now doing nothing but generating a high pitched, incredibly annoying whistling sound. Hopefully, Big Lots will take it back without a receipt. Nice job, Remington. NOT.</li>
    <li> It has now been a bit over one year since I&#x27;ve bought this trimmer, and it has finally departed for the barbershop in the sky.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, its departure has not been an easy one, taking a couple of months, and meanwhile annoying me to no end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The many quirks that other customers have experienced, such as its too sensitive touch controls and poor battery life, had in my case found themselves supplemented by a number of others, among them:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The battery dying, with the display indicating a full charge.&lt;br /&gt;This would often happen just as the blades were making contact with a couple of hairs, and instead of cutting right through, would remain stuck, leaving me cursing and frantically looking for a pair of scissors with a trimmer hanging down my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The whole thing freezing when using the touch controls.&lt;br /&gt;There are three buttons on the trimmer. One works fine (the speed regulation), the other two used to work (although they were far too sensitive. Seriously, a light breeze could trigger them), but at a certain point, an odd thing started happening occasionally:&lt;br /&gt;After pressing either one, the whole display would light up, and the trimmer would become unresponsive. Letting it lose charge and recharging it was the only solution I&#x27;d found (although not a very practical one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The selected length changing, even though it was locked&lt;br /&gt;This was the nastiest one, although it only happened twice - while trimming, I&#x27;d hear the little length-regulating motor whirr for no reason - the touch controls were locked. Apparently, when the device resets for any reason, the length resets to the shortest length (0,4 mm). I usually use a short setting, but not that short - the result would be a small chasm of noticeably shorter hair, and a long cursing session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, it finally locked up completely, refusing to wake up after I&#x27;d tried to charge it... Frankly, good riddance!&lt;br /&gt;I wish I&#x27;d never bought one,and would advise anyone looking for a beard trimmer to look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this because it cuts short for that 5 oclock shadow look(4 mm) WHEN it works. The touch controls are terrible. Most times they don&#x27;t respond which means you can&#x27;t change the speed or cut height. You can do a hard reset which fixes it sometimes, other times it doesn&#x27;t. A full charge lasts about 4 minutes which is not enough to do a beard. Long story short, don&#x27;t buy this as you&#x27;ll be sorely disappointed and maybe even angry at yourself.</li>
    <li> horrible. you have to play a game to get the right settings you want. if you tap the up arrow it jumps 1-5 numbers, depending how lucky you are. it is extremely difficult to set the length to exactly what you want because the numbers scroll so quick. after a while, the machine just dies on you. battery life is really bad but so is the quality of the computer on it. after a while, all the LEDS were lit so I had no idea what was going on. When I would turn it on no button would work until it sat there for a few minutes. I was extremely dissapointed and got super upset with this because of how annoying it was to set the length.</li>
    <li> Battery life could be better but the razor still lasts at least 3 shaves without a charge. It cuts beard and mustache hair cleanly and consistently. Once in a while the touch-controls will malfunction for a second or two but turning the razor off instantly fixes the problem. Out of the 3 or 4 trimmers I&#x27;ve used, this is by far my favorite.</li>
    <li> delivery and amazon was very profesional and nice.  but the product not good so far. if you do 1 sm or 2 sm and much so, its still cut the same in length.    UPDATE - dont buy this! dont buy this!  work very bad from the start, stop work after a month. the worst item i buy here.</li>
    <li> Is awesome! Exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I loved that it removes hair very well. Safe even for children hair cut. Governed by a very simple haircut and no difficulties and kamulyato so long runs that can even mow a few meters head.</li>
    <li> It was used has hair inside and it doesn&#x27;t work this seller stole my money don&#x27;t buy anything with him</li>
    <li> Battery is dead in less than a year. My other trimmer (Panasonic something) is 4 year old and works just fine, as wel as Norelco that I had in the past. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Touch controls were terrible.  Had to send back.</li>
    <li> it wont hold a charge.  sometimes works, sometimes doesnt.  i have to just hope i get lucky and itll turn on for me</li>
    <li> At present i&#x27;m returning this item and ordering another one. When it works, it is great, well worth the money. The problem is, it works less than half of the time. The other half of the time the length won&#x27;t adjust, the touch buttons need to be reset etc. As of today the length won&#x27;t adjust at all, it&#x27;s stuck on the shortest setting.</li>
    <li> I impulse bought this product and I should have waited until it came out and could be reviewed.  I ended up returning mine. The much-lauded touch control was imprecise, not wanting to \\&quot;settle\\&quot; on the settings I wanted, requiring a lot of attempts to get it right.  I also was disappointed that the guard was not removable for close cleaning or trimming.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my picky husband who was tired of shaving everyday and no complaints. The shaver is well-made, easy to handle and performs as advertised.  It is an ideal shaver for those who want a stubble beard.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product in November of 2011.I use to trim my beard and moustache.It will not hold a charge so you have to use with the cord.It cuts ok but the height and speed controls are touch screen and do not work well.I would not reccomend purchasing this razor!</li>
    <li> A slim trimmer that fits nicely in hand and great for travel.  I&#x27;ve used Remington&#x27;s over the years and have had good results with them.  This one&#x27;s unique because it has touch buttons, USB port or standard plug for charging, multiple settings from 0.4-1.8mm cutting depths, a lock to control the settings, 3 speeds, and a lit digital screen that shows battery life, cut depth, and lock position.  It includes a slide on blade cover, a cleaning brush, the plugs, and a short manuel.  The battery charges in 90 minutes.  I&#x27;ve yet to have the battery problems other reviewers have complained about.  So far so good.  I like the portability of it and the smooth finish.  I trim beard, burns, brows, and nape.  I think it&#x27;s a cool unit.  I&#x27;ll update if any glitches show up.</li>
    <li> Let me start out by saying I bought this product despite all the terrible reviews it has, mainly because of the cheap price and the main concern seemed to be the limited battery life, which wasn&#x27;t an issue for me because I didn&#x27;t have any problem using it while it was plugged in. However, within the first week of use the battery would not last longer than a few seconds, and even upon plugging the device in it is not usable for at least 10-20 minutes. I am extremely disappointed in this trimmer and am currently looking for a replacement of this useless device.</li>
    <li> I agree with all the other bad reviews. Reset did not work. Poor battery life, blade adjustment got stuck, buttons are too sensitive hard to adjust. Did not last 6 months. Total waste of money.</li>
    <li> My husband used this trimmer, and he loves it.  He shaves his head and said this gave him a really close shave and was very easy to use.  The touchscreen with the battery life display was also really helpful.  It also showed the speed and blade length settings on the screen.  He really liked how he could charge it with his phone charger and that it had a long battery life.  It only loses its battery if you are using it, not just if it&#x27;s unplugged.  He is very happy with his new trimmer!</li>
    <li> I have had this thing about a year, and it doesn&#x27;t work anymore. It barely worked to begin with. I have rarely used it because most of the year I grew out a beard. I had to constantly charge this before every use because the the screen would never go off unless the battery died. Now it will turn on, but the motor will not run. A giant waste of money.</li>
    <li> WORST PRODUCT I HAVE EVER PURCHASED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok so first of all.. the touch buttons on the trimmer stalled every time i used it. i would have to reset it almost every time i had to trim which is once every week. SOO this product stopped working after 4 uses....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second of all the battery died on me twice..... while showing a full charge... and when i plugged it in to charge it took it a while to turn back on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third of all... It simply stopped working... now when i turn it on it just makes a screeching noise similar to the one that it makes while the clipper is being adjusted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE......&lt;br /&gt;Wish i could get my money back... but i guess its too late now</li>
    <li> Please do not buy this product!  not one to usually write a review but frustration over this product has lead me to throw this away and not buy a Remington product ever.  The demise started when I would turn it on for a about 10 seconds and then screen went AWOL and is making a strange buzzing noise.  I cannot reset it and it takes 5 minutes before I can use it again.  At which point we go through the same cycle of it turning on and then it goes AWOL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;buy one with buttons and one that will stand the test of time... like longer than a week!!!</li>
    <li> For years I used the Remington MB200, a simple beard trimmer with no fancy electronics. It worked well enough, and I still use it ocassionally. But recently I wanted a new trimmer for 2 reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) I like my beard to be a light stubble, so I needed more precise length settings&lt;br /&gt;2) I travel a lot, so I wanted to be able to charge over USB&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since there are only a handful of beard trimmers that charge over USB, I bought the MB4550 despite all the terrible reviews. And I&#x27;m still paying for it. The reviews were right, folks. Avoid this thing at all costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the Touch Control feature is a gimmick, and a terrible one at that. The touch buttons work about 50% of the time, and good luck getting the exact length you want. What was wrong with physical buttons?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the battery is worthless. Like other reviewers, I experienced a battery life of just a few days if I don&#x27;t charge this thing, and even then it doesn&#x27;t last very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, the plastic guard that adjusts to your length not only feels flimsy and cheap, but it sticks to your face as you try and shave. You either end up stabbing yourself with the plastic ends or messing up your shave in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read all the reviews, and stay away from this piece of high-tech garbage.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this item. Cuts dark and white hairs equally well (which my old Remington didn&#x27;t do). Make sure you lock the clip length before you start trimming though, I accidentally dialed down the bristle length and am now regrowing my beard. Something I will only do the once. Still pretty happy with it though</li>
    <li> First and foremost this is the most comfortable device I&#x27;ve used to trim facial hair. Hands down the best at choosing length and cutting, not pulling the hair off my face when in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately within 2 weeks (so maybe 3 shaves) of purchasing this device it just died, wouldn&#x27;t take a charge, and became an odd shaped by paperweight. To add insult to injury it died in the middle of a shave and I had to go to a local store with a 1/2 trimmed face and drop $80 on a new trimmer before starting my day. I called Remington for a replacement, and to my discontent I had to pay more money to ship the device to them in order to secure a replacement. A few weeks later my new device shows up and I&#x27;m back in business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or not, after the second use I plug in the trimmer to top off the charge and a few days later the battery is stone dead. At least this time it didn&#x27;t quit halfway through. Presumably when I call Remington again I&#x27;ll have to shell out even more money to send it back to them. Maybe third time is a charm?</li>
    <li> This is really a bad product. The battery started dying within first few weeks and have to use it plugged in all the time, now the battery is completely dead and cannot use it any longer. The touch screen is the worst have to struggle with it the morning rush eventually gave up and settled on one setting, until the product stopped completely working in few months.</li>
    <li> I thought it would have been larger in size but its compact slim and so stylish, I took it out the packaging and admired the design before I actually began to use it. I did the full which took about 3 hours, I powered it on and immediately was in awe with the mechanics of the blade guide, smooth adjustment in 0.1-0.2mm at a time, it wasnt very accurate in terms of increments while adjusting but the desired length can be achieved going up and down a few times.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I had was on my part in forgetting to lock in my adjustment, I made the mistake of not locking the length while i was trimming my beard and my finder touch the down arrow and cut my beard down to a stubble! Fortunately for me, my hair grows back quickly, but I had to live with looking like a 10 year old for about 5 days lol, so remember to lock in your length.&lt;br /&gt;Overall impressed with the battery life (about 30 mins of use) and the design, Its so cool. I could have taken 1 star off for Remington not including a nice carrying pouch for it as i have to keep it in the plastic, but for the price I am satisfied. Buy it, cool product, it&#x27;s a good look.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge! Useless would be an overstatement.I would think twice if you are considering this item. Then don&#x27;t!</li>
    <li> I have has this for 3 days now, and i was worried after getting it and looked up reviews on here. I was going to just return it, but decided to try It out first. I got it late in evening so i plugged it in to charge and left it charged over night. The next day i shaved my beard and mustache combo, it worked great. Touch pad was smooth it cuts really close, noticed it tugs if you have blade level higher than 3 while trimming long facial hair. Next day i used trimmer again, it flashed the different height settings on touch screen without me even touching screen, but once i unlocked it and set to level i wanted to trim at, it stopped being possessed, and been working fine ever since. Battery life has not been an issue, haven&#x27;t needed to charge it since first charge. Just think you need to let product charge over night before using it.  Its light weight, send sturdy built, rubberized back for good grip, very straight forward to lock screen before trimming. Would buy again!!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this on a whim at Target thinking it would be a good replacement for my aging trimmer. Got it home and read lots of negative reviews for it on the Remington website of all places. Tried to be open-minded about it all and go into my first trim with an objective outlook. Somehow, beard hair doesn&#x27;t go in between the teeth of the blade guard. So all of my beard trimmings with this thing were pretty choppy looking. Then after a couple months of trimming about once a week, I tried to clean under the guard a little bit and it broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So besides not working very well and breaking pretty easily, the interface on it is kinda weird. The length is adjustable to the tenth of a millimeter. Why? No one needs precision like that in their beard hair. Remington just needs to provide 7-10 preset lengths that you can select with the same type of touch interface/capacitive buttons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only that but it&#x27;s battery powered. I know this is a mostly personal preference but corded trimmer is much better. Every time I traveled with this trimmer for work, I was afraid that it would be turned on and my life would become like that scene from Fight Club where his luggage was seized because they thought a bomb was inside (or possibly a dildo). The more I think about it, the more a battery powered trimmer makes no sense. Don&#x27;t most people trim their beards in a bathroom or the very least inside), where they&#x27;d be near an electrical outlet?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, get a Wahl Peanut instead. Its better, slightl cheaper, much higher quality.</li>
    <li> While the quality of the cutter is fine, and the result is ok, the device itself is one of the most horrible trimmers I&#x27;ve ever tried. The touch controls are so sensitive, you&#x27;re lucky if you hit the length setting you want - even after 100 tries! It&#x27;s completely unusable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the battery life is extremely poor. Mine went from 2 bars to completely out of power in just a minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your money is better spent elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this since November 2011, as of writing it is April 2013. I used to use this trimmer, but the thing kept dying on me. I thought it was the fact that when you turn it \\&quot;off\\&quot; the screen doesnt go off and it was draining battery, still not so sure about that issue. The touch controls are poor and not very precise, and at this point I only use it on my sideburns... I have since bought another corded trimmer that works far better. The only reason I use this is because it&#x27;s still in brand new condition and it&#x27;s easier to take out quickly for a touch up around the neck and sideburns, unless of course the battery is dead...again...</li>
    <li> Bought one and it stopped working a few weeks afterwards. I loved its precision and so thought maybe it was a fluke or I had done something to damage it. Bought a second one and the same thing happened after a few weeks. I think the electronics are either defective or too sensitive.</li>
    <li> This is my first review I have ever done for amazon but I really wanted to make sure people knew about how bad a product this is so they don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did in purchasing this trimmer. The design of the device is excellent with the lockable touchpad and intuitive controls the trimmer would be one of the greatest on the market if only for its on major shortfall. Even after a full charge the batter seems like its the size of one of those dime sized hearing aid batteries. I got halfway through my face before it shut off and pinched my hairs. I know how terrible the battery life is and I still rushed and didn&#x27;t even make it through 1 minute of shaving. 1 MINUTE! I have had this product for less than a month and it is literally the worst device I&#x27;ve ever owned. Look not all trimmers on the market are bulletproof, I have a Forex BaBliss PRO trimmer which I love however the battery is kind of weak on that trimmer too. But this is after 6 months of everyday/every other day use and neglect like leaving it plugged in on the charger. I would recommend the Forex shaver over this product the only caveat is the trimmer guards can be hard to come by if you want a different length than the two provided. Thats the only option I liked about the remington is the ability to go from 0.4mm to 18mm on the fly. If you dont mind running this trimmer corded all the time and want to make the mistake of purchasing it thats your own choice. For me I wish I hadn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> This product was rushed out the door for the holiday season. It should have never been released. The touch controls simply do not work. You press them to adjust the trimmer - sometimes something happens, sometimes nothing happens. It simply doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I love Remington trimmers, but this one gets two thumbs down.  The design looks neat and smart but it is anything but smart.  The first thing I noticed was how hot the unit gets during charging. Next the same common problems. The gard gets stuck allowing you to only control the speed.  Unit completely freezes up and makes a high pitch noise that will not stop. I tried to reset the unit according to the instructions with no luck. I had to smack the unit to get it to stop that sound.  I really wish that Remington would work out the issues because I like the appearance and the ability to trim mustache and hair. I also think this trimmer may be a fire hazard because it gets so hot during charging.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband who has a beard/goatee and he has been using it.  Yes the battery doesn&#x27;t last quite as long as some of the other trimmers but it is plenty adequate for his beard and back of the neck.  He likes that you can adjust the blade a little at a time so he can get the custom trim that he is wanting.  Blade is sharp and has no problems cutting the hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to say much about a trimmer - it trims.  Did this trim?  It did!  Did it trim well?  It did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes this one different is the \\&quot;touch control\\&quot; used to adjust the height of the trim-comb.  No buttons, just a smooth section on the front where you touch your finger upward or downward to adjust the height of the comb.  Sounds cool, like using an iPhone or iPad, but it&#x27;s either too sensitive or not sensitive enough, as I can never quite get it where I want it.  I discovered I wanted to trim at \\&quot;4\\&quot; but getting back to \\&quot;4\\&quot; was almost impossible.  I&#x27;d tap and the comb would slide up to 3.8 or 4.2 but never quite 4 again.  How it got to 4 in the first place, I can&#x27;t imagine.  The bigger question is, why is this touch control necessary?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel a need to address the battery issue, as that seemed to dominate reviews when I first received this (and, indeed, still does due to the way Amazon ranks reviews.)  It seems as if a first, very bad batch of this trimmer went out with bad batteries.  Remington is paying the price, because they must have fixed this problem as I have had no issues.  It lasted a few full trims (and I am slow at trimming my full head) and then recharged overnight just fine.  Unfortunately, the many bad reviews from before far outweigh the new good reviews.  And that&#x27;s a shame because, overall, this is a good trimmer, even putting aside the questionably-useful touch gimmick and, at it&#x27;s current price, which is about half retail, is a pretty decent deal for a good trimmer.</li>
    <li> I read the other reviews but gave this a try as it was on-sale.  To my surprise the battery was great, the controls were spot on and it was easy to setup and clean. The problem is when you try to trim up your mustache the little plastic guides that control how close you are to the actual trimmer will actually poke your lip... and it hurts!  I showed both my wife and kids and they all agree it was a stupid design, and its obvious no one did any testing for any length of time.  Right out of the box the 1st try at a trim and it was an epic fail.  Back to the bullseye store it goes.  I ordered a new Conair GMT900 iStubble Facial Trimmer from amazon that gets great reviews.  I will post a review on that product after I get it, I hope not to have the same issue.</li>
    <li> What a disappointment! I have had a short well-groomed beard for decades and have owned a number of trimmers over the years -- I know stubble/beard trimmers! Remingtons have always been one of my favorites...simple, sturdy, dependable. My last Remington (with a mechanical thumbwheel height adjustment) recently quit after about 5-6 years and I headed out to get another just like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, instead of just going ahead and replacing the unit, I got suckered into this new Remington flagship \\&quot;techie\\&quot; offering at twice the price. The MB-4550 promises of fine digital height adjustment, extra-long battery life and usb charging all seemed useful and very state-of-the-art. And the box was so pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sleek looking product is so badly designed, it makes me wonder how Remington -- with their long history -- could release it...did their design team or consumer testing group quit? Let me list the issues:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The digital adjustment is frustratingly sensitive with stubble height readouts in tenths of millimeters...the range of the height adjustments seems to be from 0.4 mm to 18 mm (i.e., overall a bit less than 3/4 of an inch). You cannot a get the digital adjustment to stop where you want it or to easily repeat settings...you are lucky to get within .3 to .5 mm of your desired setting. While these are not huge dimensions, if you typically use several settings during a single trim session as I do (lengths under chin, moustache, and side burns different from basic beard length), this is a major problem that defeats the whole purpose of the supposedly on-demand and exacting digital control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. There is also a digital lock switch which must be flipped each time you wish to change the height setting. And if you do not reset the lock, the setting will often be accidently changed as you are trimming -- this has resulted several times in my gouging out spots in my beard; something I have never done with any other trimmer! To performthe normal beard trim that I do three times a week...I will have to flip this extra lock switch 6 to 10 times...on top of the annoying digital setting problem described in #1 above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Removing the height guard to use the trimmer for straight trimming lines above the lip, along the jaw, near the ears, sideburns,etc., is not straightforward. This is a flimsier (though sleeker and more attractive) guard than my earlier Remingtons, and it does not lock into the height adjustment mechanism crisply, clearly and authoritatively, either by feel or by sight. There is also no use of color to help you...an all black unit with a slim clear guard...for those of us that now use reading glasses. Bottom line, after removal, you are often unsure if the guard is properly seated back in place and this compounds the uncertainties of #1 and #2 above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  Cleaning this and previous Remingtons requires removing the height guard and then flipping up a hinged trimmer blade component. With my previous Remingtons this piece was well-hinged to flip up and down easily and securely. Not so with the MB-4550! The hinge design is very tiny and flimsy and, as a result, the component almost always totally comes off the rest of the trimmer. It is unnecessarily tedious to then re-insert the tiny all-black trimmer blade piece hinge evenly back into the all-black trimmer body...with practice it becomes easier, but ergonomically it is a terrible design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. The USB charging connection in the base of the trimmer strikes me as flimsy, laterally exposed and vulnerable in a rough and tumble travel environment though I have not experienced any problems to date. I have certainly seen similar connections in other discount electronic and computer devices. But this USB connection is not an auxiliary connection point...it is the ONLY re-charging connection point for this trimmer! The more typical male mini-plug style connection for primary charging would have been a more reliable choice. A USB solution should have been designed with a more robust in-set connection point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each of the above issues are significant. Together they are ergonomically catastrophic and sink this trimmer like the Titanic! It may be a case of marketing and sexy looks over performance and function....it is a nice looking unit. And one to be avoided at all costs! A terrible product not consistent with past Remington products I have owned.</li>
    <li> I have to recharge this trimmer every time I want to use it.  Goes dead after very shot period of use.</li>
    <li> Very efficient beard trimmer. Easy to operate and a great result. Better than other brands by far. Stores enough battery power to travel without the charger.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had several beard trimmers and this one was one of the best I&#x27;ve had.  The touch controls are novel but oversensitive but once you adjust the trimmer blades you&#x27;ll \\&quot;lock\\&quot; the settings and probably never mess with them again.  The charger is a novel micro USB connector so you can charge from your laptop or other travel adapters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the battery life on this is awful.  Memory issues cropped up within several months of use where the shaver would stay charged for shorter periods.  I&#x27;m now down to less than a minute of usable shaving time once I have a full charge and if I don&#x27;t leave it on the charger the battery will drain itself within a day without even using it, which is unfortunate because I really liked how the trimmer worked otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip it.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2FT40BBFLEXCJ]]The video pretty much says it all. Decent shaver, it works well for me, I have used it for months on a trial basis as my primary beard and mustache trimmer with no problems with its core functionality. The quirks that Remington&#x27;s marketing department put into the device (touch controls, and a USB charging port) are minor irritations -- but they are indeed irritations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 stars.</li>
    <li> the fingers are way to flexible...had it set pretty long but managed to slice a 2\\&quot; gash in my throat the first time i used it.14 stitches..length of the cut varies depending on how hard you push...i&#x27;ll go back to my old cutter with solid rake....the usb was the main attraction since it uses the same as my phone..</li>
    <li> It is hard to align to a certain #, buttons are too sensitive making hard to select, other than that is OK</li>
    <li> Read the reviews before you buy.  I charged the battery per the instructions and when I used it the next morning it lasted all of 10 seconds before it died.  Cold it wait to return it and should have paid attention to these reviews.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a little over a year.  The &#x27;touch&#x27; controls have completely stopped working.  When turning it on the whole device goes psycho, stopping/starting/changing height/speed.  A device like this should last for years and years.  I won&#x27;t be purchasing another Remington device.</li>
    <li> Great seller.&lt;br /&gt;Product as described and of good quality.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend</li>
    <li> very nice .. easy to operate and very smooth trimming...</li>
    <li> Battery lasted only 4 weeks. The button and display quite working after 2 month.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the money. Never again Remington.</li>
    <li> This is an innovative tool. It&#x27;s for those that have a large beard. If you just grow a little fuzz then this isn&#x27;t for you. I had laser treatment on my face except for the goatee area, but the goat grows thick so it&#x27;s a quick and easy trim for me. It comes with an outlet cord as well as a usb which is great when you are traveling overseas and you need a universal charger the usb solves it.</li>
    <li> I bought this and within 2 days the blades would not adjust and the battery lost all juice , has to be plugged in to operate.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these almost 2 years ago. I really love the features such as specifying the MM, Micro-USB charging (great for traveling), and the touch screen (which isn&#x27;t necessary, but it&#x27;s a neat feature).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that the battery didn&#x27;t hold a charge even in the first month of use. Then, the screen would glitch out and I was unable to even change the length settings. I figured that I just got a defective unit, until I read the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been almost 2 years, and despite this product simply being flawed to the point of it being UNUSABLE, it remains on the market. That says a lot about Remington, in my opinion. I won&#x27;t be buying their products again.</li>
    <li> Worst trimmer i have bought in my life. Bumped the unlock lever and trimmer changed depth settings and cut off too much of my beard and was forced to trim off my whole beard...!!!! Cheap plastic guide is flimsy and catches in beard.. hair gets stuck in-between guard and is difficult to clean.. I will never by a remington product again.. as i have made the mistake of purchasing their products too many times.. Ps. while cleaning it up to return it, it quit working and would not adjust with touch controls...</li>
    <li> the touch screen interface gives problems sometimes and the battery dies very, very quickly, other than that it is alright</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;USB Charger (included).  My husband likes the fact that this uses a standard USB connection for charging, similar to a cell phone.  When he travels, it is one less cable he needs to take with him.  Plus, he can use this charger to charge his cell phone, wireless headset, and other accessories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Digital height gauge.  You can change the cut height simply by pushing the up/down button.  The LCD display shows you what height to set it at.  It is robust, because if you manually change the height, it will adjust it back to the setting (active controls).  This is important, because we have had other shavers with manual adjustments go out of adjustment during travel, only to get suprised during the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lock-out controls:  This is important, because of the button-press adjustment.  You can lock out the controls so that you don&#x27;t accidentally change the setting during shaving or storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning.  This unit is difficult to clean.  There is nowhere to collect the cut shavings, so it can make a mess of your sink&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery Life. The battery drains faster than it should.  I suspect changing the depth of cut is very energy-intensive.  I suspect if you set it and forget it the battery would last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lock-out-controls: Yes, I gave the lock-out controls a plus because of their presense.  But it is also a negative, because as others have pointed out you can accidentally bump the lockout off, and then easily change the cutting height.  A manual lockout switch would have been better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, this shaver has some nice, innovative features, but also some significant drawbacks.  For my husband, the most important feature is cut-shaving collection and easy cleaning.  This shaver is poor at both of these, so he will look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> First of all, the trimmer works very well as a trimmer.  It cuts cleanly and efficiently.  Whether on my beard or keeping my shaved head trimmed close, it does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery is another matter altogether.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first unit arrived, and I charged it for about 17 hours before using it.  It worked great for a little while, but it quickly lost it&#x27;s charge.  I then charged it for about 24 hours after which it ran for a few minutes before the battery was depleted.  I called customer service and they told me that it was my fault that I hadn&#x27;t done a full 24 hours the first time and that I had probably ruined the battery, but they would send out a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the replacement arrived, I followed the charging directions exactly.  This batter was even worse than the first.  I now use it with a cord, but I have to keep it plugged in all the time if I want to be able to use it.  If I have it unplugged and then plug it in to use, it takes several minutes before it will turn on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The height adjustment is quite fickle and difficult to get to exactly the right spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interestingly, on the first model I received it was almost impossible to remove the guard over the blade.  On the second model it comes off very easily which is a boon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the idea of the touch screen, but the implementation seems to not be ready for prime time.</li>
    <li> product is as described.. thank you !!</li>
    <li> Have used Wahl for years, but this little unit allows me to easily set a cut length and has plenty of power. Saves me ten minutes each time.</li>
    <li> I bought this product with high expectations but alas there were problems.&lt;br /&gt;Firstly the batteries would not hold charge so I returned to Remington under warranty and they replaced it but the second unit had the same problem and would not hold charge.The only way I could use it was plugged into the power point which was not convenient.Remington were not interested in replacing the unit for a second time.&lt;br /&gt;I also found the height adjustment to be very flimsy and the height control too sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;As a result I have given up and replaced it with a Braun.</li>
    <li> the trimmer from the day i received it went berzerk, it was not charging completely and went crazy . It was showing as fully charged but the second u unplug and start trimming the battery shuts off . the touch wasnt so cool either and cleaning was bad .</li>
    <li> why would anyone buy this after seeing all the reviews ?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bad controls (touch horrible), does not hold a charge after 2 months of use making it useless, and expensive.</li>
    <li> This thing works great! At least, the razor head does. It shaves off beards perfectly when it glitches mid-shave and carves a line in your beard! Very sharp and stable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it does this fun thing where, upon maxing out the length, it freezes, all the controls light up, it becomes unresponsive and makes an odd noise, while heating up making you wonder whether it&#x27;s going to catch fire! Plus when you run its battery out and re-boot it, it does the same thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$54 is ridiculous for this thing. It&#x27;s a good thing I got it as a Christmas gift or I&#x27;d be pissed.</li>
    <li> I cannot stress enough what a piece of junk this thing is. Worked fine for two weeks, then decided to go completely haywire. There is too much wrong with this thing to even begin to describe. I bought one brand-new last Christmas for my fiance, so I paid a little over $60 for it. Don&#x27;t bother wasting your money on this thing. You will regret it. Biggest waste of money I have ever spent.</li>
    <li> I bought this at a place other than Amazon. After 5 uses, the razor just revved up to full speed, would not shut off or slow down. No controlls worked. I had to put it outside until battery discharged after an hour. Tried to charge and use. Just makes high pitched whining sound. Product claims 2 year warranty. I am sending back to see what they do for me.</li>
    <li> This is the worst piece of junk i&#x27;ve ever bought&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s almost impossible to adjust the blade height and will not adjust the so called 3 speeds for the blades&lt;br /&gt;Stay away from this junk and try a different brand</li>
    <li> great product.. easy to use/understand... touch controls are great to use... battery lasts quite long ... the best part is it charges really fast and usb charging is a great help ...</li>
    <li> This is a truly awful product. Will only work for me while plugged in, and each time it needs to &#x27;charge&#x27; for 10 mins before I can use it - yes, while it&#x27;s plugged in. &#x27;Touch&#x27; buttons are clunky, yet who really needs 0.1mm increments? My beard grew more than that waiting for it to become ready to use. It&#x27;s not too bad as a trimmer when it finally gets going, but by then it&#x27;s too late. Victor Kiam is turning in his grave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this trimmer for a little while, but I really like it and its features. Only one problem - BE AWARE of the trimmer&#x27;s plastic head and its position when using it. Mine slipped off onto the floor and I took a nice swath of hair off my chin. I had to trim it all the same length so it would be even. Didn&#x27;t look too good for a while! I have a rubber band around the head now and I&#x27;ll watch it closer. Like I say, I really like all the features, so I can put up with this as long as I watch it, I think.</li>
    <li> I buyed this item it has battery problem (full recharge my remington after 5 minutes is stop working for low battery) I commented this for bad item, this person said for me if you remove your comment i back your money and said you can throw. He is liar (He dont recived my money). DONT BUY ITEMS FROM THIS SELLER!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this trimmer in October.  While the controls were touche I learned to work with it.  Then the battery went dead and poof nothing would work.  Maybe time to look at another product without all the fancy controls.  Remington needs to scrape this model.</li>
    <li> What can I say?  Great product!  Well built, good features, long battery life.  Plus it&#x27;s great for travel since you can charge it using USB.</li>
