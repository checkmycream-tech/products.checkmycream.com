      <li>Have used this brand most of my life!</li>
      <li>So nice to be able to still get it!</li>
      <li>This is a nice product.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice brush</li>
      <li>cant say much more, its a good quality nail brush...</li>
      <li>We scoured all over town for a wooden brush and couldn&#x27;t find one,  This one a perfect replacement for one that disappeared.</li>
      <li>but it is still stiffer and works much  better.  </li>
      <li>I work as a nurse and even though my toes are safely in my nurses shoes and no one will notice, my fingers are not.  </li>
      <li>and sure does the job.</li>
      <li>They are my favorite nail brushes.</li>
      <li>no falling out bristles, everything stays together, love the warmth of a wood.</li>
      <li>more to say about this item.</li>
      <li>It does last for years and is a very effective cleaner!</li>
      <li>Easy on the hands and nails while getting the job done.</li>
      <li>The cluster of dirt that would collect around the finger nails and toes came off easy with this brush and water.  </li>
      <li>The bristles are too soft to do any good, and they fall out, a lot.  </li>
      <li>a good item after some major gardening or working under the car.</li>
      <li>I saw this brush and thought it might just help me clean up.  </li>
      <li>Nice soft bristles, doesn&#x27;t shed!</li>
      <li>I use it every day in the shower and it really does a great job, especially on feet that have been walking around all day in slippers (flip flops).</li>
      <li>It is a great little tool to help clean up with.</li>
      <li>The second star is because it looked nice, before the wood cracked.</li>
      <li>a good concept but not stiff enough.  </li>
      <li>Indeed, they are fairly soft, but they are just fine for me--typically dirt or grease under fingernails, etc.  </li>
      <li>The bristles are pretty ineffective too.</li>
      <li>The bristles started falling out upon first use.</li>
      <li>I suspect that if the bristles were stiffer, they would damage the skin with much use.  </li>
      <li>Often on these kinds of brushes the shorter side has firmer, stiffer bristles, I don&#x27;t really sense much difference between sides.</li>
      <li>and he absolutely refuses to use anything</li>
      <li>I really like this item.</li>
      <li>But seems OK other than that.</li>
      <li>I make sure it dry&#x27;s completely before using again on the nails.</li>
      <li>Yes the bristles are soft but they clean under my nails and around the cuticle just fine, especially when you add in some of that gritty orange hand cleaner for grease monkeys.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s huge, way bigger than my old nail brush.</li>
      <li>Still, decent for the price.</li>
      <li>This is not the brush for the mechanics bathroom, it is suitable for normal everyday hand washing.</li>
      <li>The brush lost hairs and wasn&#x27;t strong enough to scrub properly.</li>
      <li>When the thing is new</li>
      <li>Plus if you leave it next to your sink it doesn&#x27;t seem to hurt it to be wet most of the time.</li>
      <li>I was concerned that it might not be effective because some reviewers said the bristles weren&#x27;t stiff enough.  </li>
      <li>The bristles on this are natural and very soft.</li>
      <li>did not think I would like this brush as much as I do now, after having used it several times i really like it, there is a nifty feature that may not be apparent.  </li>
      <li>the bristles are reasonably stiff, but with use, it becomes softer, and not as easy to remove dirt under fingernails.</li>
      <li>and I appreciate the fact that it is biodegradable, but if you are looking for something to scrub under your nails, this is too soft</li>
      <li>The wood &amp;#34;pine&amp;#34; is soft</li>
      <li>but these natural bristle brushes</li>
      <li>This scrub brush has soft natural bristles.  </li>
      <li>What sold me on it is the Natural Bristle&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>Bristols are stiff enough to clean your hands.</li>
      <li>Small enough to fit in the tub or by the sink.</li>
      <li>I found my old one - same design</li>
      <li>Both sides are evenly soft, so it doesn&#x27;t work to scrub deep into fingernails.</li>
      <li>I have used it normally, and always placed it on a towel after usage to dry.  </li>
      <li>This little brush is easy to use and handle and as I said I love the natural bristles and the real wood base.  </li>

<li> This item is less than 30 days old and the wood has split at both ends.  </li>
<li> Nice if you&#x27;re just photo styling a bathroom for photos or a model home or something, but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase for everyday use, sadly.</li>

<li> Loosely spaced bristles that don&#x27;t hold lather well.</li>
<li> Will never figure out just how it is to be &amp;#34;hung&amp;#34; up to dry, as it has and never has had any hole or attachment for hanging up, so it eventually will rot, but that is something one just comes to expect!</li>
<li> Immediately started rotting even though I was so, so careful to keep them dry after use.</li>
<li> This one would not clean under my nails thoroughly enough.  </li>
<li> This was not at all what I expected----</li>
<li> Also, the wood cracks after it gets wet.  </li>
<li> One side could have had harder bristles, it doesn&#x27;t get all the dirt from the garden off.</li>
<li> Wood started splitting after getting wet.</li>
<li> They aren&#x27;t really stiff enough for cleaning under nails.  </li>
<li> Previous lasted very long time.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing</li>
<li> I had tried my other body brushes to go after the toes and fingers</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve found other uses for it though.</li>
<li> The wood absorbs some water, and I wonder how well it will last, hard to tell.</li>
<li> Turns a black color at the area of bristle meets the wood.</li>
<li> I have cleaner nails today because of this little tool.</li>
<li> The end of the base which is wood is very well machined for and EXTREMELY flat surface</li>
<li> the bristles are much too soft -- very disappointed as I bought one as a small gift for my husband as well as mine</li>
<li> Not sure how one determines if the one advertised is stiff.  </li>
<li> Waste of money!</li>
<li> The wood cracked after few weeks of use!</li>
<li> If the bristles were too hard it could hurt you under the nails.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m giving it away as a gift because it&#x27;s kinda ugly.</li>
<li> Disappointed with the quality of the brush as soon as I opened package.</li>
<li> Wood base somewhat bulky and cumbersome to handle.</li>

    <li> Have used this brand most of my life! So nice to be able to still get it! Will never figure out just how it is to be &amp;#34;hung&amp;#34; up to dry, as it has and never has had any hole or attachment for hanging up, so it eventually will rot, but that is something one just comes to expect! It does last for years and is a very effective cleaner!</li>
    <li> Both sides are evenly soft, so it doesn&#x27;t work to scrub deep into fingernails. Wood base somewhat bulky and cumbersome to handle.</li>
    <li> A bit larger than anticipated, I like a lower profile brush- Just my personal preference. Often on these kinds of brushes the shorter side has firmer, stiffer bristles, I don&#x27;t really sense much difference between sides. It grips nicely, is good looking and sure does the job.</li>
    <li> no falling out bristles, everything stays together, love the warmth of a wood. cant say much more, its a good quality nail brush...</li>
    <li> The bristles on this are natural and very soft. They aren&#x27;t really stiff enough for cleaning under nails.  I&#x27;ve found other uses for it though.</li>
    <li> This item is less than 30 days old and the wood has split at both ends.  I have used it normally, and always placed it on a towel after usage to dry.  Makes you wonder what type of wood was used, or do they care...they got my money, don&#x27;t let them take yours!</li>
    <li> did not think I would like this brush as much as I do now, after having used it several times i really like it, there is a nifty feature that may not be apparent.  If you look closely at the brush, at either end, you will see that the bristles do not go all the way to the end, for me that is great since I can stand the brush on end in between uses and it air drys very nicely.  The end of the base which is wood is very well machined for and EXTREMELY flat surface</li>
    <li> I have cleaner nails today because of this little tool. I make sure it dry&#x27;s completely before using again on the nails.</li>
    <li> Great brush. Gentle but firm.</li>
    <li> I really like this item. I bought one because someone I know has one and I was always using hers. Yes the bristles are soft but they clean under my nails and around the cuticle just fine, especially when you add in some of that gritty orange hand cleaner for grease monkeys. If the bristles were too hard it could hurt you under the nails. Plus if you leave it next to your sink it doesn&#x27;t seem to hurt it to be wet most of the time. a good item after some major gardening or working under the car.</li>
    <li> One side could have had harder bristles, it doesn&#x27;t get all the dirt from the garden off.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s huge, way bigger than my old nail brush. I&#x27;m giving it away as a gift because it&#x27;s kinda ugly. But seems OK other than that.</li>
    <li> The wood &amp;#34;pine&amp;#34; is soft so it cracked in a about a week. Turns a black color at the area of bristle meets the wood.</li>
    <li> This scrub brush has soft natural bristles.  Perfect for scrubbing both skin and nails.  This is not the brush for the mechanics bathroom, it is suitable for normal everyday hand washing.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Bristols are stiff enough to clean your hands. Small enough to fit in the tub or by the sink.</li>
    <li> The wood cracked after few weeks of use! Previous lasted very long time.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing more to say about this item.</li>
    <li> The brush lost hairs and wasn&#x27;t strong enough to scrub properly. Loosely spaced bristles that don&#x27;t hold lather well. Disappointed with the quality of the brush as soon as I opened package.</li>
    <li> We scoured all over town for a wooden brush and couldn&#x27;t find one,  This one a perfect replacement for one that disappeared.</li>
    <li> a good concept but not stiff enough.  I had another which I lost so bought this as a replacement.  This one would not clean under my nails thoroughly enough.  Them I found my old one - same design but it is still stiffer and works much  better.  Not sure how one determines if the one advertised is stiff.  The only visible difference is that my stiffer one has white bristles and the one I just bought is tan , as it shows in the photo.</li>
    <li> The bristles are too soft to do any good, and they fall out, a lot.  Also, the wood cracks after it gets wet.  The second star is because it looked nice, before the wood cracked.</li>
    <li> Good nail brush. Best I found.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second one and will buy another when this one wears out. I use it every day in the shower and it really does a great job, especially on feet that have been walking around all day in slippers (flip flops).</li>
    <li> Works great for both the fingers and toes.  I work in the garden and do wear gloves but If I can I go barefoot.  I feel closer to earth well, I come out muddy toes and fingernails even with the gloves.  I saw this brush and thought it might just help me clean up.  What sold me on it is the Natural Bristle&#x27;s.  I did not want a synthetic or plastic brush. I work as a nurse and even though my toes are safely in my nurses shoes and no one will notice, my fingers are not.  The cluster of dirt that would collect around the finger nails and toes came off easy with this brush and water.  Some bristles do come off so I try not to use a lot of water.  Dirt that has collected under the finger nails need the help of a nail file.  I had tried my other body brushes to go after the toes and fingers but they were to big.  This little brush is easy to use and handle and as I said I love the natural bristles and the real wood base.  The bristles are hard enough to work away the dirt but not hard like plastic.  It is a great little tool to help clean up with.</li>
    <li> The bristles started falling out upon first use.</li>
    <li> Good brush. Wood started splitting after getting wet.</li>
    <li> Nice soft bristles, doesn&#x27;t shed! Easy on the hands and nails while getting the job done. Have ordered some for stocking stuffers. Have used these for couple of years. They are my favorite nail brushes. Esp. good for someone who works w/ their hands and gets cracked fingertips.</li>
    <li> I was concerned that it might not be effective because some reviewers said the bristles weren&#x27;t stiff enough.  Indeed, they are fairly soft, but they are just fine for me--typically dirt or grease under fingernails, etc.  I suspect that if the bristles were stiffer, they would damage the skin with much use.  The wood absorbs some water, and I wonder how well it will last, hard to tell.</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s a nice brush and I appreciate the fact that it is biodegradable, but if you are looking for something to scrub under your nails, this is too soft</li>
    <li> When the thing is new the bristles are reasonably stiff, but with use, it becomes softer, and not as easy to remove dirt under fingernails. Still, decent for the price.</li>
    <li> I like the nail brush. I wish, however, that the bristles were a bit stiffer.</li>
    <li> Could not find one of these locally, so I had to go online.  This is a nice product.  It looses bristles, but I expect that.</li>
    <li> Excellent!  &amp;#34;All that, and a Bag of Chips&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> My grandfather had been looking all over for these, states that they are the best around and he absolutely refuses to use anything but these natural bristle brushes</li>
