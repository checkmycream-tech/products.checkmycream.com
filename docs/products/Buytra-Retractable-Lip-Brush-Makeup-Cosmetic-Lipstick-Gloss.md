<li> To the person who complained that it took 6 weeks, the estimated ship time is listed right up there on the page.  </li>
<li> don&#x27;t know how long they will last.</li>
<li> Order a different product if the wait is too long.  </li>

<li> two pieces arrived well before due date.  </li>

<li> CHEAP CRAP</li>
<li> so I have one for travel and one for everyday.  </li>
<li> I have had brushes in the past where once you were done applying lipstick, you have to pick off all the little bristles that got stuck to your lips.  </li>
<li> The brush doesn&#x27;t even retract without you pressing a tiny, painful metal knob that digs into your thumb the entire time you use it.</li>
<li> , you can&#x27;t go wrong, especially at this price!!</li>
<li> n got here late.</li>
<li> The person who complained about the button may not have been using it correctly.  </li>
<li> so there&#x27;s nothing negative to say...</li>
<li> LOUSY, BUT NOT WORTH THE EFFORT TO RETURN</li>
<li> it has broken apart.  </li>
<li> The words poor quality don&#x27;t quite get at just how bad this product is, not to mention the 6 week shipping time.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t like it, the product is awful</li>
<li> Awful product and will not repurchase!</li>

    <li> Took forever to ship but I can&#x27;t complain. They&#x27;re cute a I got 4 not 2.</li>
    <li> two pieces arrived well before due date.  Spring loaded and compact.  The wife seems to really like so there&#x27;s nothing negative to say...especially when you&#x27;re referencing a two dollar item.</li>
    <li> Very Cute and serves the purpose when using glosses or lipsticks</li>
    <li> Small enough to store in any size of purse. The brush is right size. With this price, no complaints at all.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t lipstick but a lipstick brush.  So far, it&#x27;s a great find for applying lipstick evenly.  Each pack has two so I have one for travel and one for everyday.  Mine is silver in color.  There is no color choice.</li>
    <li> The words poor quality don&#x27;t quite get at just how bad this product is, not to mention the 6 week shipping time. The brush doesn&#x27;t even retract without you pressing a tiny, painful metal knob that digs into your thumb the entire time you use it. I&#x27;d advise you to avoid a waste a money, no matter how little money.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THESE... CHEAP CRAP WHICH BROKE THE FIRST TIME I USED THEM... LOUSY, BUT NOT WORTH THE EFFORT TO RETURN</li>
    <li> The first one I opened immediately broke. The way it works is you remove the cap from the &amp;#34;top&amp;#34; and stick it on the &amp;#34;back&amp;#34; - this compresses the button that pushes out the bristles. Then when you&#x27;re done, take the cap off the &amp;#34;back&amp;#34; to retract the brush, then put the cap back on the &amp;#34;top.&amp;#34; Problem is, when I did this, the end of the applicator broke off inside the cap so I couldn&#x27;t put the cap back on! Definitely get what you pay for, I guess.</li>
    <li> the brushes were fine, but came with a logo on them.....which didn&#x27;t show in the pic.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like it, the product is awful n got here late. Seller was nice to respond back. Awful product and will not repurchase!</li>
    <li> nice brushes,looks stylish.</li>
    <li> i do want to add that since i started using the second one this week....it has broken apart.  The metal part keeps slipping out so it is not actually retracting.  I want to order more but i do need a sturdy product.</li>
    <li> These are perfect for what they are.  And for the cost, who cares about the shipping time.  Love it!</li>
    <li> So far so good, The colors i ordered did not receive those but its ok. they gave me the next colors. and they were nice. So far the lip brushes are pretty good don&#x27;t know how long they will last. But worth the price. omg it is. they cute. to put in your purse. Have a nice day yall. P.S. the only thing is if you in a rush to get these you have to pay more for express delivery. It took a whole month for me to get these, but worth the wait cause they are so inexpensive. I have them and I am enjoying them.</li>
    <li> They we&#x27;re exactly what I wanted. The price was awesome and beat any I had seen anywhere else.</li>
    <li> Really cute, and is exactly what I was looking for!  I had been searching brick and mortar stores for a lip brush for a while, and no one seems to carry them anymore. I actually feel like my lips have been smoother since I started using this.  The bristles do not come off as you use the product, which is huge.  I have had brushes in the past where once you were done applying lipstick, you have to pick off all the little bristles that got stuck to your lips.  Not the case here.  I also for some reason got four!  It&#x27;s great, I use one at home, then put color on another to keep in my purse in case I need to refresh during the day. The compact size makes it perfect to tuck in anywhere!&lt;br /&gt; The person who complained about the button may not have been using it correctly.  You aren&#x27;t supposed to hold the button while applying lipcolor, you are supposed to put the cover on the back of the brush and the cover slides the button up to expose the brush.  To the person who complained that it took 6 weeks, the estimated ship time is listed right up there on the page.  Order a different product if the wait is too long.  If it&#x27;s not a lip brush emergency and you don&#x27;t mind the wait, you can&#x27;t go wrong, especially at this price!!</li>
    <li> This order should keep me always having a nice lipstick brush!</li>
    <li> Loved it!!! It&#x27;s so compact :)</li>
    <li> I like the size and the look.  It looks more expensive than the actual cost-that&#x27;s a plus.  Works well too.</li>
