<li> For those who are rating this product as bad more then likely it is because of user error and not the product.</li>

<li> when you use this product your hair should not be soaking wet.</li>
<li> The product can stand alone (no cocktail needed), but may flake if other products are added</li>
<li> I have long, thick, bi-racial curly hair (to the small of my back), the shrinks to almost shoulder length and gets Tina Turner big every time I&#x27;ve tried to wear it down or without a ponytail holder.</li>
<li> Makes my hair a little bit harder than the other Miss Jessie&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used.</li>
<li> you want to make sure that you use Miss Jessies Leave In conditioner  as a base coat.</li>
<li> to the point where I can wear my hair down all day and not feel like it looks like a bush.</li>
<li> day two, I applied a moisturizing crème to my hair - which caused the gel to flake into sandy little balls.</li>
<li> I was heavy handed with my application, fearing the product wouldn&#x27;t hold my tight 4c</li>
<li> All this did was make my curls crispy and limp.  </li>
<li> I use to use a heavy gel</li>
<li> This keeps the hair from getting that heavy crunch.</li>
<li> but it does it without getting really stiff.  </li>
<li> My hair may be a little hard after use</li>
<li> Flakes is usually because you have not distributed the product on the hair shaft.</li>
<li> and I have never had bad results.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t hate it.  </li>

    <li> Makes my hair a little bit harder than the other Miss Jessie&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used. The Jelly is a better product.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best curl custard for my 3c hair. The best thing of all is I don&#x27;t have to use everyday. It allows me to shake and go right from the bed!!! Gives elongation and body!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is ok.  I like creamier leave in custards....this one feels slimy and looks like gel.  All this did was make my curls crispy and limp.  I&#x27;ll use it but mixed with something creamy.</li>
    <li> My hair may be a little hard after use but it does a great job with removing frizz</li>
    <li> Sparkle Princess Glitter &#x27;Fro - yeah, that&#x27;s what my (medium density) 4c coils looked like when I got from under the bonnet dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natural ingredients? - Looks ok to me&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply? - Pretty good slip in my tightly coiled hair&lt;br /&gt;Nice fragrance? - Same fresh fabric softener scent as the Jelly Soft curls. Dissipates after it dries&lt;br /&gt;Dries quickly? - I didn&#x27;t air dry - sat under a bonnet dryer&lt;br /&gt;Soft coils? - Yes, flexible touchable coils once it dried&lt;br /&gt;Shine? Freakishly sparkling hair. I was heavy handed with my application, fearing the product wouldn&#x27;t hold my tight 4c coils.&lt;br /&gt;The color and texture of the product resembles flaxseed gel, though not as mucous.&lt;br /&gt;My wet hair looked opaquely coated - which turned to a glittery shine once dry. I believe this was because I applied too much and didn&#x27;t air dry, maybe the product didn&#x27;t have enough time to absorb onto my hair, so loops of coils dried with a shiny film bubble.&lt;br /&gt;The film bubble cast did not flake, but misting my hair didn&#x27;t make the glossy film go away.&lt;br /&gt;I put a headband on take attention away from my glitter fro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On day two, I applied a moisturizing crème to my hair - which caused the gel to flake into sandy little balls. That was a no-no. Had to wash it out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest users apply the product sparingly, air dry the hair, and re-wet with more Coily Custard as Miss Jessie&#x27;s recommends. The product can stand alone (no cocktail needed), but may flake if other products are added later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to give Miss Jessie&#x27;s credit - they are trying to give the people what they want, reliable products for beautiful curly hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through 2 bottles of this, it&#x27;s amazing especially for a wash n go it gives me good volume &amp; definition</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t hate it.  It&#x27;s O.K.  I believe the cure enhancing soothing product works the best in my hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for people with afro texture. I have be using this product for 3 months now and I have never had bad results. For those who are rating this product as bad more then likely it is because of user error and not the product. Number one when you use this product your hair should not be soaking wet. It should just be damp. Number 2 you want to make sure that you use Miss Jessies Leave In conditioner  as a base coat. And make sure that you use it liberally. Less is more. Second as you apply the product you need to make sure you are giving even  distribution  from root to end. Most people as always don&#x27;t distribute the product evenly on the hair strand and then complain when they have shrinkage. Last as you apply the Custard you should try it with the Baby Butter Milk recently launched at Sally&#x27;s. If you can&#x27;t that then find something with similar ingredients that has Glycerin. Make sure it does not have Cetly Alcohol. That will just interfere with the product more. This keeps the hair from getting that heavy crunch. Last if you are getting flaking all you have to do is get a spray bottle with water and reactivate product on hair shaft to smooth out. The hair will automatically re-curl and not have  the residue. Flakes is usually because you have not distributed the product on the hair shaft.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST! I have long, thick, bi-racial curly hair (to the small of my back), the shrinks to almost shoulder length and gets Tina Turner big every time I&#x27;ve tried to wear it down or without a ponytail holder. This custard is THE ANSWER! It gives me nice looking curls while keeping my hair  elongated... to the point where I can wear my hair down all day and not feel like it looks like a bush.They really hit the mark with this product!</li>
    <li> The best product ever and I feel I have tried them all!  I have naturally curly red hair that gets frizzy at an instant.  I use to use a heavy gel but with this product it protects my hair from the humidity but it does it without getting really stiff.  I also love the fact that it really does make my hair stay longer.  It is so curly it curls up and gets shorter all day long.  Not as much now!</li>
    <li> I have 3a hair, but my curls demand moisture. I&#x27;ve used tons of products on my hair and I can&#x27;t get the hold and care for my hair in one product.  This stuff is awesome thou. My curls are so shiny and soft! Hold my curls so well. At the end of the day, I got some frizz but I live in humid Fl, so it&#x27;s expected. But awesome! Try it out</li>
    <li> Unused this product for my flex rod hair when the curls fall out. So I wet my hair and added a little bit with the rods and it turned out perfect the next day. Wish I had pictures. I have soft texture that is nature but this product help the hold and lasted.</li>
    <li> My hair becomes stiffer. The custard doesn&#x27;t prevent frizzing of the hair.</li>
    <li> Gives my 3c/4a hair a perfect coily air dried wash n go, love how it moves in the wind!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  Does wonders for my curls.  Never thought I could do a wash n go until I used this.</li>
    <li> It used to work well in dry weather, but doesn&#x27;t work that well in very humid weather.</li>
    <li> I looooove how soft my hair is after using this product. I use it when I twist my hair and my twistout has soft hold. I have 4C hair and it&#x27;s great on my hair. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love this on my multi-cultural curls daughters hair.</li>
