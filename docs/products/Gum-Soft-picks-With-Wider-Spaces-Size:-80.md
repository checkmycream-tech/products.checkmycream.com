      <li>This is really the best that I&#x27;ve found.</li>

      <li>but they get the job done better.</li>
      <li>Love them</li>
      <li>Recommended by my dentist and works just fine.</li>
      <li>Much needed for wider spaced teeth - love this product!.</li>
      <li>works great for bigger spaces between teeth</li>
      <li>I was so happy to find this bigger version for deeper and wider spaced pockets between the teeth.  </li>
      <li>Worth every penny!</li>
      <li>I needed something to clean between my teeth since I&#x27;ve got braces and can&#x27;t really floss.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The larger blue picks are great for the wider teeth spaces.  </li>
      <li>I would like to see a larger more economical box size from the manufacturer.</li>
      <li>Now instead of hit and miss flossing, it&#x27;s daily, quick and easy.</li>
      <li>Works pretty well.  </li>
      <li>She gave me a sample of the regular size GUM Soft-Picks and said they have been found to do a better job than floss.</li>
      <li>I have tried these and a few other brands and like these best.  </li>
      <li>I loved the regular size  but a few spaces were too large to get completely clean</li>
      <li>Overall it is really quite satisfying to get stuff out from between your teeth that can&#x27;t be reached by normal brushing.</li>
      <li>Highly Recommended!</li>
      <li>Thanks much</li>
      <li>The 2 sizes of soft-picks along with floss is getting the job done very well</li>
      <li>Yes, these are a larger (blue) version of the already awesome (green) Soft-Picks by GUM, which my dentist introduced me to several years ago.  </li>
      <li>They work great at getting out food particles and are less fragile than the smaller gum picks, However with vigorous use will break also.  </li>
      <li>Easier than normal floss.</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t find them in the store and the regular ones are too small to do a good job of cleaning between all the teeth</li>
      <li>Good strenght but not to thin for close teeth</li>
      <li>so you sometimes need to use several to get the job done right.</li>
      <li>My hygienist keeps me up on any new gadgets or techniques she learns about.  </li>
      <li>Cost is near 50 bucks plus some shipping.  </li>
      <li>This is the only one that is at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>They are soft and don&#x27;t hurt to use.  </li>
      <li>My dentist recommended picks like these after frequent cavities between my teeth.  </li>
      <li>Now Amazon just needs to start selling them in a larger-quantity packet, like the original green soft-picks.</li>
      <li>It is a profound rip off.</li>
      <li>The GUM bristles are made of a flexible soft but sturdy rubber (but its not natural rubber latex, in case you are allergic.)  </li>

    <li> These are great!  My dentist recommended picks like these after frequent cavities between my teeth.  I have tried these and a few other brands and like these best.  They are soft and don&#x27;t hurt to use.  Overall it is really quite satisfying to get stuff out from between your teeth that can&#x27;t be reached by normal brushing.</li>
    <li> The work great. I needed something to clean between my teeth since I&#x27;ve got braces and can&#x27;t really floss.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that they sometimes bend when I&#x27;m forceful trying to get them between some of my teeth that have tight spaces. Perhaps that not really the fault of the product, however. I like them enough to continue buying them despite that occasional annoyance.</li>
    <li> Have been looking for a deal at a store and we have to use these on my daughter&#x27;s teeth because she has orthodontics.  These are just right and the price was great as well.</li>
    <li> Great product. .. but hard to find in my local pharmacies. Glad I could get it online.</li>
    <li> These work great in between teeth.</li>
    <li> Yes, these are a larger (blue) version of the already awesome (green) Soft-Picks by GUM, which my dentist introduced me to several years ago.  Just when you thought a product could not get any better, it did!  Now Amazon just needs to start selling them in a larger-quantity packet, like the original green soft-picks.</li>
    <li> My hygienist keeps me up on any new gadgets or techniques she learns about.  She gave me a sample of the regular size GUM Soft-Picks and said they have been found to do a better job than floss. They are nothing like the hard plastic picks I have tried from the drugstore which only injured my gums. The GUM bristles are made of a flexible soft but sturdy rubber (but its not natural rubber latex, in case you are allergic.)  I loved the regular size  but a few spaces were too large to get completely clean so I tried these wide ones and they do the trick.

The 2 sizes of soft-picks along with floss is getting the job done very well and  it takes me less time.  Very happy with these new &amp;#34;toys&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> But, like others I can not find in locale retail stores in Fresno, CA.  It appears that a site called scottsdental dot com has these wider picks in a box containing 72 packages with 5 picks per package.  Cost is near 50 bucks plus some shipping.  Hopefully these wider picks will find their way to amazon, sold by amazon, soon in larger quantities than 5 or 80.  The larger blue picks are great for the wider teeth spaces.  They do not last any longer than the standard green picks but they get the job done better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very picky about oral hygiene so using these instead of tooth pics seems like a great ideal.  These can get between the teeth a lot better than tooth picks and work great.  Highly Recommended!</li>
    <li> Larger and works, maybe just not worth the extra $$ over the other ones...</li>
    <li> My dentist suggested these and they are great.  Love them</li>
    <li> This is really the best that I&#x27;ve found. Somehow they don&#x27;t have a lot of soft-picks with wider spaces that my dentist recommends. This is the only one that is at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Flimsy. Breaks apart in mouth with slightest pressure. Better made ones on market. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Works as described; good value</li>
    <li> Very handy. My dentist recommended. Hated using floss, so this was a nice alternative. Now instead of hit and miss flossing, it&#x27;s daily, quick and easy.</li>
    <li> Perfect for floss haters! Worth every penny! Get regular if you don&#x27;t have big gaps in gums.</li>
    <li> GREAT FEATURE , MAKING THE BRUSH PART WIDER...GOOD JOB.</li>
    <li> works great for bigger spaces between teeth</li>
    <li> just as it supposed to be</li>
    <li> I had wide samples and these were not like the samples.</li>
    <li> Good strenght but not to thin for close teeth</li>
    <li> Prompt shipment. Fair price. Item as described. Good transaction.</li>
    <li> Hard to find in retail stores, as this is a new product. Recommended by my dentist and works just fine.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well.  They do tend to break apart - white stick part away from the blue brush so you sometimes need to use several to get the job done right.</li>
    <li> I have some in my purse, car, desk.  Perfect for a quick floss and they don&#x27;t break like a wooden toothpick.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for</li>
    <li> Much needed for wider spaced teeth - love this product!.</li>
    <li> This product does nothing for teeth or gums. It is a profound rip off.</li>
    <li> Perfect.  Couldn&#x27;t find them in the store and the regular ones are too small to do a good job of cleaning between all the teeth so I need both sizes.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find this bigger version for deeper and wider spaced pockets between the teeth.  They work great at getting out food particles and are less fragile than the smaller gum picks, However with vigorous use will break also.  I would like to see a larger more economical box size from the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> Good for the teeth. Easier than normal floss.</li>
    <li> Really pleasant to use - you can feel yourself doing good. Something I look forward to which means I use it which means I benefit.</li>
    <li> Works wonders with getting food and plaque from between the tight spaces in your mouth. Thanks much</li>
