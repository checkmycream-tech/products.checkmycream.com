      <li>It may not be the best steamer</li>
      <li>Great piece for the price .</li>
      <li>It is a great value</li>
      <li>I am not feeling great about this purchase</li>
      <li>good quality product delivered on time.</li>
      <li>good euipment</li>
      <li>The light is awesome for many uses</li>
      <li>The mag lamp is great, easy to use, adjustable .  </li>
      <li>easy to set up good quality product...</li>
      <li>It is very easy to assemble.  </li>
      <li>Not terribly sturdy and a bit leaky.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>Would not recommend unless you&#x27;re on a budget, but if you can spare the money get a better product.</li>
      <li>but  I will have to get a better one soon.</li>
      <li>the price point is attractive because these machines are all very overpriced online, who needs a $10,000 20 function machine??</li>
      <li>Its&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>Pretty good for the price</li>
      <li>It was shipped out to me very quickly and arrived intact.  </li>
      <li>The height of this product can easily burn clients and the steam arm does not swivel to adjust.</li>
      <li>we need a decent 3-4 functions around $200  range but good luck finding one.</li>
      <li>machine is fine, but it supposedly has an aromatherapy feature and it is not mentioned&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
      <li>Cheap cheap cheap</li>
      <li>The light won&#x27;t stay in the position I put it.</li>
      <li>I clean it, take care of it.  </li>
      <li>Clean with vinegar often.</li>
      <li>other than that, the machine is great for the price.</li>
      <li>But other than that, it works great.</li>
      <li>and it is prone to falling over, but since the tank gets very hot you have to proceed cautiously.</li>
      <li>There are no handles on it to push or pull, and the tank gets very hot.</li>
      <li>works very well and easy to assemble.</li>
      <li>It makes noises, the arm won&#x27;t position right.</li>
      <li>First: make sure the bolt is tight when attaching the casters and it will not wobble and seem top heavy/lopsided.</li>
      <li>This product is exactly what we were looking for.</li>
      <li>First, I guess I misread</li>
      <li>great but its a little off balance and wiggles but as far as working i am running it non stop!</li>
      <li>It is top heavy and topples over easily, which makes it a hazard to those who work with it and our clients.</li>
      <li>Thanks so much!</li>
      <li>Luckily it is light enough to pick up and carry.  </li>
      <li>The company sent me a replacement cap so, really, all is well now.</li>
      <li>but I really wish the water container was glass not plastic.</li>
      <li>I should have spent the money up front instead of rescheduling our facials while we purchase more units.</li>
      <li>I was excited to receive this steamer initially.</li>
      <li>And yes, I do use distilled water and clean it with vinegar regularly.</li>
      <li>6 months in and the steamer pretty much just caught on fire in my room during a facial right next to my client.  </li>
      <li>The side supporting the steamer is much heavier than the side supporting the lamp thus the stand does not support the entire unit properly.</li>
      <li>There was dripping all around the sides and such even when I made certain the equipment was attached correctly.  </li>
      <li>Do not purchase this item.if possible spend a little more for quality</li>
      <li>Shipping charges to send back too much so sold on Craigslist to someone who wanted to fix it.</li>
      <li>Second: use only distilled water and top it off after each use; even if it is just a little low it will make noise.</li>
      <li>The steam barely comes out.</li>
      <li>It is not easy to open and refill as many other steamers are.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Update: I ordered 2 and in less than a year of light use, they are both now garbage due to no warranty.  </li>
      <li>Only issue is that the fill cap seal/gasket won&#x27;t sit flush in the grooves making the fill cap not fit tight and secure on the machine.</li>

<li> :( it&#x27;s ok for now</li>
<li> The steam barely comes out, doesn&#x27;t even reach my clients face much less anything else!!!</li>
<li> The entire unit wobbles back and forth, unfortunately it almost fell onto my client</li>
<li> Waste of money.  </li>
<li> so I am writing to save you from the experience and waste of money</li>
<li> It is very awkward and the aroma steam basket broke the first day.</li>
<li> If I had seen all these negative reviews I would not have bought it</li>
<li> Second, the arm of the steamer does not move, so awkward to position.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t buy this, it&#x27;s a waste of money!!</li>
<li> This machine was not a good purchase.</li>
<li> The well of the lamp handle is so weak.</li>
<li> The lamp does not hold where you put it and moves around so very hard to adjust so that it stays put while you&#x27;re using it.</li>
<li> and I dont know where it goes, but it came like that...and it was also broken where the steams comes from the machine.  </li>
<li> but it was broken off</li>
<li> Unfortunately, the steam does dont come out well.  </li>
<li> Purchased this steamer and is completely useless; steam does not come out.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
<li> NOT happy at all!!</li>
<li> Very poor quality...</li>
<li> The base broke after 1 month, so I had to use black duct tape and crazy glue to hold it together.</li>
<li> It makes screeching noises so bad that I cannot use it.</li>
<li> Both steamers we bought broke at the base of the arm within 6 weeks.</li>
<li> I was embarrassed and appalled.</li>
<li> I hate it.</li>
<li> I am very disappointed with this product.  </li>
<li> Just a piece of crap!</li>
<li> Horrible product...</li>
<li> This is the worst steamer I&#x27;ve used in my career of 14 years as an Esthetician.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought this unit  I hate it. The light won&#x27;t stay in the position I put it. Then the steamer arm is so so short it basically has to be a few inches from the client face. The metal bracket broke off.  I would recommend this to anyone. If I had seen all these negative reviews I would not have bought it so I am writing to save you from the experience and waste of money&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> great but its a little off balance and wiggles but as far as working i am running it non stop!</li>
    <li> good quality product delivered on time. use it in my salon. works very well and easy to assemble. was using it same day it was delivered</li>
    <li> I purchased this steamer April 2013 and it stopped working. It makes screeching noises so bad that I cannot use it. And yes, I do use distilled water and clean it with vinegar regularly. Also, the cap that covers the aromatherapy basket broke, so the steam escapes before it can get to the arm. Very poor quality...I would not buy this if I were you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok...I have learned a lot about this machine. First: make sure the bolt is tight when attaching the casters and it will not wobble and seem top heavy/lopsided. Second: use only distilled water and top it off after each use; even if it is just a little low it will make noise. Third: Clean with vinegar often. Fourth: You can refill the the water through the cap...you do not have to remove the tank. By the way, the aromatherapy basket is under the cap. The company sent me a replacement cap so, really, all is well now. It may not be the best steamer but it works for the money.</li>
    <li> NOT happy at all!! The steam barely comes out, doesn&#x27;t even reach my clients face much less anything else!!! Don&#x27;t buy this, it&#x27;s a waste of money!! I&#x27;m so upset!!</li>
    <li> The side supporting the steamer is much heavier than the side supporting the lamp thus the stand does not support the entire unit properly. The entire unit wobbles back and forth, unfortunately it almost fell onto my client I was embarrassed and appalled. I would not suggest the purchase of this item.</li>
    <li> Purchased this steamer and is completely useless; steam does not come out.&lt;br /&gt;All 6 of my estheticians tried to get it working to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;Pick a different steamer.  I am waiting for the response from Amazon and&lt;br /&gt;the seller about my request to return.  Hassle!</li>
    <li> machine is fine, but it supposedly has an aromatherapy feature and it is not mentioned&lt;br /&gt;in the instructions and I cannot find a way to add it to steam.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointing, but other than that, the machine is great for the price.</li>
    <li> Not terribly sturdy and a bit leaky.</li>
    <li> Horrible product... Stopped working within 2 days.. Cheap cheap cheap</li>
    <li> Great piece for the price . Fits well in the skin care room. The light is awesome for many uses</li>
    <li> not what I expected - out of balance with the steamer and light - not easy to move about sorry</li>
    <li> This is the worst steamer I&#x27;ve used in my career of 14 years as an Esthetician. It is top heavy and topples over easily, which makes it a hazard to those who work with it and our clients. It is not easy to open and refill as many other steamers are. There are no handles on it to push or pull, and the tank gets very hot. When you want to move it you have to move it by the tank since there are no handles and it is prone to falling over, but since the tank gets very hot you have to proceed cautiously. The height of this product can easily burn clients and the steam arm does not swivel to adjust. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive this steamer initially. There are a few simple features it lacks that I wish it had held out for. First, I guess I misread but I really wish the water container was glass not plastic. Second, the arm of the steamer does not move, so awkward to position. And third, the cord are very short so you need an extension cord. Have had it about 2 weeks and only mishap is that an employee did not tighten the water jar for steam in fear of cracking the plastic, so the steam wasnt forcing out. Its&#x27;s ok. the price point is attractive because these machines are all very overpriced online, who needs a $10,000 20 function machine?? we need a decent 3-4 functions around $200  range but good luck finding one.</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what we were looking for. Only issue is that the fill cap seal/gasket won&#x27;t sit flush in the grooves making the fill cap not fit tight and secure on the machine. But other than that, it works great.</li>
    <li> Weels keep falling off</li>
    <li> It is very awkward and the aroma steam basket broke the first day.:( it&#x27;s ok for now but  I will have to get a better one soon.</li>
    <li> Both steamers we bought broke at the base of the arm within 6 weeks. Finally after 10 months they are both decommissioned. Aweful plastic design. Find an alternative</li>
    <li> This machine was a rickety piece of poop from the beginning.  I should have returned it when I realized the stand bolt was stripped but dealt with it.  6 months in and the steamer pretty much just caught on fire in my room during a facial right next to my client.  I clean it, take care of it.  Just a piece of crap!</li>
    <li> Did not receive instruction on how to put together. Steamer would not work. Shipping charges to send back too much so sold on Craigslist to someone who wanted to fix it.</li>
    <li> This machine was not a good purchase. It makes noises, the arm won&#x27;t position right. The steam barely comes out. You get what you pay for. Do not purchase this item.if possible spend a little more for quality</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, the steam does dont come out well.  There was dripping all around the sides and such even when I made certain the equipment was attached correctly.  And there is a piece unattached but it was broken off and I dont know where it goes, but it came like that...and it was also broken where the steams comes from the machine.  I am not feeling great about this purchase and I must return.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for asking.</li>
    <li> The well of the lamp handle is so weak. I just spin around a little big , it breaks already.</li>
    <li> easy to set up good quality product...good euipment</li>
    <li> It is very easy to assemble.  The steamer arm is not as adjustable as I thought it would be.  It can only move side to side and not up and down.  The mag lamp is great, easy to use, adjustable .  I do wish it had a mirror on the underside for my client to see but I did attach one myself.  It is a great value and I recommend it.</li>
    <li> The wheels don&#x27;t roll well.  Luckily it is light enough to pick up and carry.  As of how the product actually works will be reviewed next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I ordered 2 and in less than a year of light use, they are both now garbage due to no warranty.  Waste of money.  I should have spent the money up front instead of rescheduling our facials while we purchase more units.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed with this product.  It fell apart bit by bit.  The wheels fell off, the water container cracked....</li>
    <li> Pretty good for the price</li>
    <li> The base broke after 1 month, so I had to use black duct tape and crazy glue to hold it together. Then 2 months later the water container started cracking and now leaks. This is very side heavy leaning toward the water side. The lamp does not hold where you put it and moves around so very hard to adjust so that it stays put while you&#x27;re using it. Would not recommend unless you&#x27;re on a budget, but if you can spare the money get a better product. The rust in the photo is from water leaking onto the holder.</li>
    <li> I just received my steamer/mag. lamp combo. Tested it out and it works great!  It was shipped out to me very quickly and arrived intact.  There is no timer on it, which is what I prefer. The low water alarm works as well. Thanks so much!</li>
