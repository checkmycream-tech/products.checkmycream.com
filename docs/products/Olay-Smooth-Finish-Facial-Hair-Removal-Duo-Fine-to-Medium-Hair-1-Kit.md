<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this product to remove my facial hair. It is so easy and doesn&#x27;t burn my skin.</li>
    <li> Fast and easy. And the bonus is the</li>
    <li> I love it it works like magic its not very spendy but on the off side it can leave just a couple hairs behind but nothing tweezers cant fix</li>
    <li> I really liked the product and it works well.</li>
    <li> Probably the best facial hair removal cream I&#x27;ve ever used. Other products burned so bad. This one left minimal redness and all the hair was removed. I left it on for about 9 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I attached a photo of what how it looks after I used it. This pic was taken about 10 minutes after application and removal.</li>
    <li> I love it! I bought a lot of for my friends.</li>
    <li> I followed the directions exactlyas they were written and it only removed about half of the hair. I also used this product over a week ago and my upper lip is still peeling.</li>
    <li> This product removes hair without irritating your skin. this blows nair out of the water. Would definitely recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many other brands of facial hair remover, but each one left my skin red with rash, that lasted a couple of days, followed by ugly peeling.  The barrier cream that you apply first puts a nice cushion between the skin and the hair removal cream, and I have had no redness, rash, or peeling from this product.  Thank goodness I found it!</li>
    <li> I bought for my mom who didn&#x27;t like all the dark hairs over her upper lip -- she LOVED it and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results.</li>
    <li> What can I say about another good Olay product.  It works, and your skin will feel smooth afterwards.  The hair doesn&#x27;t grow as fast (but everyone is different).  Will purchase again.  However, I do wish the price is lower and that the tubes were bigger.</li>
    <li> Works well, just don&#x27;t leave on longer than the recommended time or you WILL get burned</li>
    <li> I have blonde peach fuzz on my upper lip and chin and this product works well for me! I leave it on for 8 minutes and it does the job!</li>
    <li> Love this product and its so easy to use but i think the proportion of the protector and the actual cream is off. i finidhed two sets of these already but I haven&#x27;t use one of the sticks that protect your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall i will recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this to anyone that has sensitive skin that burn with other products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always skeptical of OTC hair removal products, especially in my facial area, but this one is fool proof.  The instructions are easy to follow and it left my skin feeling really smooth and hairless without the redness, pain, or cost that comes with waxing.  I&#x27;ve used the product three times, followed the instructions carefully and had zero irritation.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and very fine facial hair.  However, this item didn&#x27;t work for me.  Perhaps, I put on too much primer cream.  At any rate, hardly any hair was removed.  It was as if I never did anything.  On top of everything else, I bought this kit myself.  I love Olay, use all their products and was heart broken when they discontinued their cosmetic line.  This is my first disappointment.  Frankly I&#x27;m not sure why they made it.  It is overly busy, with a pretest (same as other hair removal products) and the primer and finally the depilitory itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer mentioned that putting the instructions only on the box is inconvenient.  Even if they included an instruction sheet inside the box, it would enable the user to store that one sheet with the product for future use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Proctor and Gamble Company is usually so on top of its products that I am surprised at this one.  I use so many of their products and am always pleased so this was a surprise.</li>
    <li> This is basically nair.  It smells like nair it doesn&#x27;t work at removing facial hair(like nair) and it gives me a headache like nair.  It burns like nair and it costs way more than nair.  The protective balm is basically lip gloss for your face... It&#x27;s like putting petroleum jelly on the side of your face when you dye your hair so it doesn&#x27;t stain.  That is the only part of this that is different from nair and it&#x27;s not worth the price.</li>
    <li> Product has been tried 3 times and works as described. There was no irritation. A couple key things to keep in mind are 1) that you must follow the directions, and 2) make sure to use a liberal amount of the cream as listed in the picture on the directions. Also make sure to leave it on for the proper amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definately buy again!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product because I LOVE Olay. But this one just didn&#x27;t do it for me. After I was done using it, I still noticed hair on my upper lip. In short, it doesn&#x27;t remove all the hair, especially the finer ones. It&#x27;s not terrible, but it&#x27;s too expensive for what it really is. A lot of cheaper products will do the job better (nair, anyone?)</li>
    <li> This is \\&quot;good stuff\\&quot; and gentle as advertised.  I&#x27;ve used it once and will use it again.  I am thinking about using it on my chin as well, although it does not say it is for that purpose.</li>
    <li> I had a tough time deciding between four and five stars. The reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 is that it didn&#x27;t remove all of my facial hair above my lip in one application. Also, I have noticeable hair but it&#x27;s not severe--I don&#x27;t know how this product would do in that case. In my case it&#x27;s possible it didn&#x27;t work completely the first time because I haven&#x27;t used a depilatory in years, and maybe one application of anything wasn&#x27;t going to do the trick. On the hugely positive side, though, this depilatory was completely pain free. I used to apply one years ago. With that product, the removal cream is applied first, followed by the cooling gel. With the Olay product, you apply the balm first, massaging it over the area you will be applying the actual depilatory. I was thrilled. Somehow applying the balm first did protect my skin from any sensation at all of burning. Wow! The one I&#x27;d used years ago used to burn while it was working and although the time you left it on was 5-8 minutes, I didn&#x27;t really know exactly when to remove it. Too soon and the depilatory wouldn&#x27;t have had time to work, even though it had been burning. Too late and a redness would be left behind because I hadn&#x27;t removed it soon enough. Also, with that product, you had to wait 7-10 days before you could reapply it. With the Olay product, you only have to wait 3 days for reapplication. So, for me, when the first application didn&#x27;t quite work, the second application definitely did. And I can do it every few days if I want. I haven&#x27;t found the perfect period of time to leave it on yet--the instructions say 6-8 minutes. I&#x27;ve tried it for both 6 and 7 minutes, and 7 seems to have done pretty well. I have ultra-sensitive skin, and so I did the test application on my wrist precisely as Olay instructed, and I would caution anyone to do the same thing. One time I applied a depilatory to my legs and did the test but didn&#x27;t wait long enough for my skin to react so when I applied the solution to my legs, I was horrified. There was pain, stinging, and itchiness, followed by a terrible rash. The Olay instructions also warn about chapped or sunburned skin, that kind of thing, but I&#x27;m just so relieved that it was so easy and didn&#x27;t sting at all. Another reason for not quite five stars is that I don&#x27;t know if that area above my lip felt completely ultra smooth. If you&#x27;re at all concerned about kissing someone and having them detect just the slightest sense of stubble, I&#x27;m not sure if this is the right product. Waxing might be better. But, for me, this product is an A and I will definitely continue using it.fied. There was pain, stinging, and itchiness, followed by a terrible rash.

And it works! Amazon LLC price is the lowest you&#x27;ll find, shipping lightning fast. Don&#x27;t waste gas to drive to the store just to spend more. Get it here. You will not be sorry.</li>
    <li> Typical Thursday night at my house equals giving myself a mini-facial and battling my growing beard :-  Of course I&#x27;m exaggerating a bit, but I once failed to pluck for a month and found at least 12 long hairs on my chin!  I was disgusted.  Though I typically pluck regularly, I had a bit of fuzz on my chin.  Not long or course enough to pluck, but more than enough to give me a complex!  So I tried Olay&#x27;s Duo and I have no regrets.  I used only one swipe of the step 1, then rubbed it in a circular motion on the entire area &amp; applied step 2.  I waited 9 minutes, then wiped off the product with a cotton ball.  Then I wet a 2nd cotton ball and wiped off the area again. Washed my face with Dermalogica, but subbed in Olay Regenerist serum for moisturizer.  Now my skin is in that area is baby soft and 80% less fuzzy.  Hence the 4 stars vs. 5 stars along with cons stated below.  I fully intend to use the product again in 3 days and see if I can get rid of the last few hairs. So in closing..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;- Got rid of a lot of my chin fuzz&lt;br /&gt;- Left skin so soft I can&#x27;t stop touching it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-Didn&#x27;t get rid of 100% of hair in one treatment (more than willing to try 2nd treatment in 72 hrs)&lt;br /&gt;- Washed my face 2X and my chin still tingled! (Put an ice cold towel on my chin to alleviate it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am happy with my results.  I am AA, have some coarse chin hair that tend to grow long &amp; a fine, persistent fuzz (all chin area). I will update review to chronicle any problems, improvements, etc.</li>
    <li> This product at first worked but after a few times it now causes redness.  I do leave it on the maximum time (10 minutes), otherwise it does not get all the hair.  Unfortunately, I cannot use any more because of the irritation.  I have somewhat sensitive skin, so it may work better for someone else.  Other than that, fairly easy to apply and use, but sometimes some tiny amount of hair remains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sounds like a good idea but did not work for me.</li>
    <li> I have dry and sensitive skin. I&#x27;m a medium complected Caucasian with medium brown hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used this type of hair removal before, but I saw this product at Costco so I decided to give it a try. I decided to do my first facial test on my sideburn area. This area never used to be a problem for me, but in the last few years I have gotten more facial hair. I have never waxed/tweezed/shaved this area before. So I followed the instructions and used a THIN layer of the balm, massaged it in, then a thick layer of the other stuff. After 8 minutes, I wiped with a tissue and at first thought \\&quot;Oh no, it didn&#x27;t work\\&quot; because I still saw hair, but then I wiped with the tissue again and realized all the hairs were moving with the tissue (detached from my face). Wow! So I wiped them all up (gently ran my bare finger over the area and pulled at the ones that didn&#x27;t come with the tissue...they came off without any discomfort), rinsed with water, and didn&#x27;t get any irritation. No burning sensation or anything negative...I didn&#x27;t even notice any smell really, besides a VERY faint \\&quot;burning hair\\&quot; smell after about 7 minutes of the product being on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the amount of product in the package, I would estimate I could do my full jawline/chin/lip area at LEAST 3 times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Olay, I was starting to have to think about facial hair remover (No!No! was on my list, along with Silk&#x27;n, and going to the salon for threading which hurt like all hell)...your product is great, I won&#x27;t be trying any of the others now that I have a solution (I was concerned about long term effects of the no!no! and silk&#x27;n, and those don&#x27;t work on peach fuzz or anything besides thick black hairs anyway).</li>
    <li> I got this product at Walmart and wanted to share that if you use it right it works great. I got a little red afterwards but it went away within hours and I noticed that a cooling sensation works to calm the red quicker.</li>
    <li> I followed directions EXACTLY like I was supposed to and was very disappointed ----- it did not work. Even waited 10minutes.  The remover has a smell to it, also. Have peach fuzz on chin and dark hair on my upper lip and it did absolutely nothing.</li>
    <li> I have to admit, I was very weary of purchasing this product; partly because of the reviews and partly because I didn&#x27;t want to throw away $20+ on a product that has competitors offering the same thing for much less. One of the main factors that pushed me to try it, was seeing that Olay was offering refunds to all the women who had a poor experience. All in all, I&#x27;m 100% happy that I took the risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past I have tried Nair, even sensitive skin formula, and I have still ended up with irritated skin or only partial hair removal. Olay left me with smooth skin and 95% hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every woman&#x27;s background and condition is different, so to help all who read this review understand, I am a white female that had fine &#x27;peach fuzz&#x27; hair development along my upper and lower lip; which developed, in my opinion, due to me being a former cigarette smoker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon opening the package, I followed the instructions precisely as indicated. Olay highly cautions users to not leave the product on for more than 10 minutes. I want to say that I do not endorse taking a risk outside the recommended usage, but I do want to testify to the fact that this product is gentle on the skin due to the fact that I had let time get away from me and had left the product on my upper lip for roughly 15 minutes. Even then, I experienced zero irritation (no dryness or redness) and 95% hair removal. The few hairs left are the ones that are in the far corners of my mouth, and along my lower lip line, where I did not want to get the product too close to my mouth opening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, Olay does not recommend using this on the eyebrows or near the eye area, but I did try it on the bridge of my face between my eyebrows to rid myself of the peach fuzz in that area as well. Again, it worked very well on all the fine hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to women looking to get the effects of waxing without all the irritation and mess. It&#x27;s a perfectly private solution that works in less than 10 minutes and leaves absolutely no evidence behind.tion that works in less than 10 minutes and leaves absolutely no evidence behind.</li>
    <li> I usually wax and pluck upper lip. The hair is black and between fine and coarse. Left this on for 10 minutes and it removed ALL my hair. I did have to apply slight pressure when removing and wiped off with a circular motion. I love this product. Only slight irritation afterwards that I&#x27;m sure will be gone within 24 hours. Smell was fine. No more waxing for me. Worth the price.</li>
    <li> Works well and the effect lasts for a week.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this product.  I have tried everything over the years from waxing to bleaching to depilatory creams and this is by far the best.  I have sensitive skin and always end up with an embarrassing burn mark/blemish/sore after hair removal but I have now used this twice (72 hours apart) and was embarrassment free and I am so grateful!  I agree with previous reviewers in saying that you must follow the instructions and extend the protection cream beyond the area you are planning to \\&quot;defleece\\&quot; (as my husband would call it).  Also I have mostly fine to medium hairs, which this worked great on, but I haven&#x27;t tried it on anything more course than that.</li>
    <li> Works really well but have to put it on thick.  Hair regrows lighter and not stubbly.</li>
    <li> Cheapest, easiest way I have found to remove facial hair.  I like that it comes for fine hair and includes protection for my fair skin</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work very well for me.</li>
    <li> Disappointing ! i thought it would be something new &amp; different...just the same old smelly dipilitory cream you can get anywhere..and for a lot less money</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product twice after following directions exactly.  I&#x27;ve had good results and will use again. I will admit that I find the two steps slightly annoying, especially because application of the skin guarding balm needs to be thick, but not too thick. I&#x27;m not sure what that means and I&#x27;m also not sure this applies to everyone.  I would think your skin&#x27;s sensitivity is what would determine the thickness.  That, and the nature of your facial hair. My facial hair is not course, just a little thick and lighter than when I was young. (I&#x27;m very grateful it&#x27;s no longer a dark brown.) I really liked the way my skin felt afterward and I did not suffer any redness or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am at the age where I have sporadic hairs sprouting from my chin. (I think if this is the worst thing to go through at 50, I shouldn&#x27;t complain - I just wish they weren&#x27;t white.  And they only seem to show up when I&#x27;m outside and in the public, of course.  I would use this product to get rid of them if they weren&#x27;t so sporadic - or if I could see them in my bathroom mirror.  Very frustrating.  The only solution offered was taking birth control pills - the ones the FDA recently took off the market.</li>
    <li> I ordered this expecting to love it and justified the price by saying the whole pack costs about as much as it would to get waxing done professionally plus it would be much less painful, which is true, but now that I&#x27;ve tried it I wish I would have saved the money. I have fairly fine, medium/light hair that I wanted to remove so I followed the directions perfectly and it didn&#x27;t remove all of the hair. I had to go back through and tweeze the remaining hair which is NOT painless, plus even with the balm my skin turned red and irritated. The pack is also SO small- I think I will get about 3 uses out of it. In my opinion it is better to just get Nad&#x27;s waxing strips because you will probably get 5x the uses for 1/3 of the price, and usually wax is more effective at removing hair (at least in my experience) -The pain of knowing I wasted that $20 + on a mediocre product is worse than the split second pain of waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: painless, easy&lt;br /&gt;Cons: expensive, not 100% effective, very small amount of product</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t put a lot of faith in beauty products (if only there was a facelift in a jar!) but I&#x27;ve been hoping for an effective way to remove facial hair that would not require paying for laser treatments. I tried this product on my upper lip about two weeks ago and was delighted with the results.    You begin by applying a protective balm to the area to be treated and massaging it in for 20 seconds. Honestly, the balm feels like Vaseline. You apply a thick layer of the hair remover over that. The instructions said to leave it on for 6 to 8 minutes, or no more than 10 minutes for coarser hair. I left it on the full 10 minutes just to see how it would affect my skin. About 9 minutes in, I started to feel a slight burning sensation. When I wiped it off with a cotton puff, presto -- the hair was gone. My skin was completely smooth. It continued to tingle when touched for about 20 minutes after that but there was no redness or irritation. I put on makeup and went to work about 30 minutes after completing the hair removal process.     Two weeks after using this product, the hair is just barely starting to grow back, so I don&#x27;t know yet how often I&#x27;ll need to use it. Results may not be this good for everyone, but, for me, the Olay hair remover absolutely worked.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product. I have tried everything under the sun for facial hair and it always turned out horribly. I didn&#x27;t know whether to leave it or risk just burning the crap outta my face. But this stuff truely works! I did have a slight redness that went away within the hour. Nothing like the 3 to 4 days with all the other crap. I def. recommend this!</li>
    <li> I thought this would be better than Sally Hansen since Olay has built a name for itself lately in the beauty aisle however i was greatly disappointed.  The protecting balm is stiff and hard to massage into your treatment area for 20 secs as directed.  The creme removal stung as it was applied and then after 8 minutes I still had to tweezer hair stubble.  Perhaps, it is meant for fine, fine hair only.  If so, it should say that on the box.  My facial hair is fine to medium but I can&#x27;t use this product.  I am going back to Sally Hansen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased at Amazon.com and it was delivered within two days.  NO issues there.</li>
    <li> I normally use Nad&#x27;s on my upper lip and it isn&#x27;t exactly pleasant so when I saw this product on sale I had to try it.  I followed the directions and left the product on for 9 minutes for my fine/medium hair.  I saw a lot of the hair come off but the next morning I had stubble!  It feels like I shaved! I never have had that happen with wax.  I don&#x27;t know whether to try the product again in the next few days or wait until it&#x27;s long enough to go back to waxing.  Again, very disappointed, especially for the $$</li>
    <li> Olay Smooth  Finish Facial Hair Removal did not take off all the hair on my chin even when it was used continuously. Please stop all future orders of this product to me, for  I do not want anymore of this product.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;Jan D. Fowler</li>
    <li> I bought this product because Olay is such a reputable brand, so I thought it must be better than everything else I tried.  However, it didn&#x27;t work.  I used it on my upper lip for fine hairs, kept it on for nine minutes, and the hairs were still there.  They were shorter and thinner, except near the roots, so it looked like stubble.  I&#x27;ve tried it twice with the same results.  It is really over-priced too.  I gave the product two stars instead of just one because it didn&#x27;t cause any redness or irritation like most products.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I tried this product.  I used to be a home waxer but had to stop once I started using Retin-A, as the wax would just rip off my skin.  Bleach made my \\&quot;stash\\&quot; look just like a blonde stash and looked really stupid.  I will not shave.  And I tried a facial Nair product years ago that did nothing.  So for the past year or so I&#x27;ve been looking for a new solution and just painfully plucking in the meantime.  And it was very painful to pluck right in the center so most of the time I just wouldn&#x27;t.  And then I found this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This worked exactly like it was supposed to and the hair all came right off.  I have NO irritation.  And while it&#x27;s expensive I used very little and it seems like the product will last for many uses.  Worth every penny!  And I can vouch for any other Retin-A users that it is safe to give this a try.</li>
    <li> This product should be a good product... a gentler alternative to other harsh hair removers. However, the first issue with this product is that even when applied according to the directions with a heavy coat, it fails to remove about half of the hairs. I only have light peach fuzz, no thick coarse hair here. The other issue is that while it seems to be gentle, a couple days after use I had an uncharacteristic acne break-out in the area on my chin where it was applied. I have had much better luck with a $4 bottle of Nair and I think you will too.</li>
    <li> I like this product, it is easy to use and effective. I did try the product in a small area as was suggested by the manufacturer prior to using it on my face. I would suggest this product to others.</li>
    <li> I was a bit hesitant to believe the Olay Smooth Finish Facial Hair Removal Duo 1 Kit would remove my facial hair without causing sensitive skin.  The balm reminds me of lip balm that comes in a stick and is clear.  I have no idea if this product is different or not, but somehow it works.  You put the balm on your skin first and rub it in.  Then you place the hair removal cream over the area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used the product, there was a litle hair remaining very close to my lip on the outer edges.  I believe this was my fault, as I was hesitant to go that close.  I did a better job the second time I tried it and made sure that I put the balm actually onto my lips so that I felt comfortable getting the removal cream closer.  This did the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very surprised that I didn&#x27;t have the typical red burning feeling that I normally have when using hair removal creams on my upper lip area.  I normally spend the evening put loads and loads of lotion on the area, but I did not have to do that with this Olay product.  It just takes a little experimentation and practice to get the balm and cream applications correct.</li>
    <li> I have what I consider to be fairly sensitive skin, and this worked awesome without any irritation.  You do notice that there is a slight tingly feeling after the product is on for a few minutes, and it feels numb for a little while after you take it off but that is it. Much better than the redness I get that lasts for 1/2 hour or so if I wax. I used this only on my upper lip on fairly fine hair. I thought at first it was leaving quite a few behind but once you rinse and wipe with warm water the rest come right off.  I will definitely be using this product again!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive 40+ skin; especially sensitive when using depilatory facial hair removal products. However, this product did a remarkable job for me. Works exactly like it claims to. The protecting balm was a huge advantage, and made all the difference. It didn&#x27;t damage my skin at all. The removing creme didn&#x27;t have a strong smell, like most products of this type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the upfront cost of this product, my only real disappointment is that the regrowth appeared within 3 days. I left the removing creme on for 8 min, so maybe 10 next time? I felt that even though the cost seems somewhat high, there is enough product for a good 6-8 applications for me (upper lip only). This depends, of course, on how large an area you&#x27;re using it. Overall, the best of this type of hair remover I&#x27;ve used yet.</li>
    <li> To begin with I have always had that stubborn upper lip hair that I have fought with since about age 13. Stopping just short of laser treatments, I have tried just about everything to keep from looking like a female Tom Selleck. Though most of the products were successful in removing the hair, the affect on my skin was unpleasant red bumps or rash-like splotches which lasted for a day or more.&lt;br /&gt;With Olay&#x27;s new hair removal kit, however, I find that this was not the case. The pretreatment balm definitely does what it promises. Not only did it prevent the removal cream from burning but also kept my skin from breaking out. Right after removing the treatment my upper lip was actually the color of my normal skin tone... very surprising!&lt;br /&gt;Of course, the cream did the trick as well! With the exception of about three \\&quot;problem\\&quot; hairs which are very thick and require regular tweezing, all of the offending fuzz was gone with a swipe of the tissue. Overall, I would say the hairs were of medium thickness and the cream did an amazing job.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this great new product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Olay is hosting their rebate program again. If you purchase $30 worth of their products by December 31, 2011, you can send in this form [...] with your receipt and receive a $10 rebate. Definitely a great deal if you are a loyal Olay customer!</li>
    <li> Yes, this product worked.  With that being said, I don&#x27;t feel that it worked any better than Sally Hanson or Nair. Considering how much more expensive it is than other brands of hair removers, I don&#x27;t think the expensive price can be justified.  Next time I&#x27;ll just spend $7 on the Sally Hanson product.</li>
    <li> Works better than the average hair remover and it doesn&#x27;t burn at all. It was priced much more reasonably through Amazon than at the drug store so I thought it couldn&#x27;t hurt to give it a try and I&#x27;m so glad I did. It&#x27;s brilliant and it&#x27;s now on my subscribe and save list.</li>
    <li> Six-tenths of an ounce of remover for over $20?  NOT a good value.  I barely got three uses out of that tube.  Yes, it works, but so does Sally Hansen brand...and they give you almost four times the product for less than ten dollars.  Save your hard-earned money.</li>
    <li> my face is cut and hurt all over my face after I used it. The worst product i ever used. Do not use this product. You can see picture that I just apply very thin layer about 2 minutes and came out with that much hurting and Wound. My face very hurt even wash with water and touch it. I can&#x27;t put anything on my face. Its very very very very hurt that I can&#x27;t explain in words. I&#x27;m very afraid that will have scars on my face.</li>
    <li> I have about 10 chin hairs and a fair mustache .  The product didn&#x27;t have any effect on either.  I was very disappointed with the results ...Olay is a reputable company and I hoped for better results as this product was much more expensive than competitors in the hair removal market.</li>
    <li> Followed directions to a T, simply does not work. Extremely disappointed. Only fine hair needed removal. Should be taken off the market, false advertising. Hated giving even one star but no other option</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to another Olay product to do what it&#x27;s supposed to do, BUT, as one of the other reviews stated, it did not remove my \\&quot;coarse\\&quot; chin hair, and removed about 50 percent of my lip hair...For the price of this product, I feel as if the other OTC products for facial hair or sensitive skin work just as well and for a third of the price..I do see the price has already dropped from the $29.99 I paid to $22.99..I will not purchase this again unless the price drops a bit more. Why would I pay this much for something that does not remove those stubborn hairs? Sorry, but thank-you for trying.</li>
    <li> It took 2 tries, but it worked. Though it hurt for an hour or two i think if you have a problem with unwanted facial hair, this product is for you! It&#x27;s discrete and it works well.</li>
    <li> I was surprised when I found out about this product from Olay. It fits well with the product line.  I was skeptical as I have tried several different brands of hair removal cream, mostly without success and some irritation.  When I received it, I wasn&#x27;t too keen on a 2 step process.  I put off trying it because I have been &#x27;burned&#x27; before!  I finally tried it and followed the directions.  I must say that it worked very well, better than I expected.  It removed all of the hair on my upper lip and around the bottom lip. I was able to get right up to the lip and my nose without any problem or irritation afterward. I did not try it on my chin as there are a few coarse hairs and nothing but tweezers works. My skin was smooth and NOT irritated at all. I think it is as good as waxing without the pain!  I am now waiting to see how long it takes to grow back for the next application. I will try it on my chin just for comparison.  So far I would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> As promised, it does not irritate my skin like other products - waxes or creams - but it also doesn&#x27;t completely remove the hair.  I&#x27;m anxious to see if regular use helps any, but if I end up with hair after application, what&#x27;s the point?</li>
    <li> I am impressed but not bowled over by the Olay Smooth Finish Hair Removal Kit. I&#x27;m fairly sure that I will continue using it since it has much more positives than negatives for me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives:&lt;br /&gt;**It is pretty effective in removing facial hair in the 10-minute maximum time period. A few stragglers remained, but those were easy to pluck.&lt;br /&gt;**I did not get a rash from using it--a rare occurrence for me. As a precaution, I did the recommended 48-hour test twice and didn&#x27;t have any effects.&lt;br /&gt;**There is hardly any scent which is important in a product you will have right under your nose for ten minutes (especially if, like me, you&#x27;re asthmatic or sensitive to odors).&lt;br /&gt;**It is easy to apply and remove.&lt;br /&gt;**It is much easier (and faster) than plucking one-by-one, and much less traumatic than wax or those sticky gels you yank off with a cloth. I&#x27;m a certified coward and I hate pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;**It removed the fine to medium facial hairs just fine, but the stiffer ones remained.&lt;br /&gt;**Although I didn&#x27;t get a rash or even slight redness, I did get a residual tingling for a couple of days if I passed my finger over the area. It&#x27;s nothing annoying or numbing but it feels strange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other observations:&lt;br /&gt;**The instructions say to use an amount equivalent to a small grape. This seems like an awful lot of cream for about a 3\\&quot; thin strip. I used it and maybe that is why I got that tingling. I&#x27;m going to use a little less next time.&lt;br /&gt;**Even if you do use small-grape sized amounts, there is sufficient amount in the tube for many applications so I don&#x27;t think the per-use cost is going to prove unreasonable. (The product says 12, but I think it looks like more. I used it once and did two allergy tests and the tube still looks full).&lt;br /&gt;**There is a protective cream you apply before the treatment that is probably a good idea. I&#x27;m glad I read the instructions, because my instinct would have been to apply it afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the whole, it may not be perfect but, until I find \\&quot;Perfect\\&quot;, I&#x27;ll stick with this one.&#x27;ll stick with this one.</li>
    <li> Not at all what I was hoping for.  Leaves a nasty smell and doesn&#x27;t remove all the hair.</li>
    <li> Works well, not as great as waxing but better still than other products I have used. You need to use it about every week and a half so the results last shorter than I would have liked. The packaging is great however and can easily work for travel.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have time going to salon, so I just got this Olay Smooth Finish Hair Removal and I love it. It saves me so much time and money. The first step is to use the balm to protect your skin. Then use the second tube to put on the hair removal cream. Leave for 5-8 minutes and then scrub off. That easy and fast</li>
    <li> My wife has tried numerous products of the years.....the main concern I have heard is the problem with irritation.  So when I read the write up for Olay Smooth Finish Facial Hair Removal Duo.....I thought it looked promising.  We got it, she used it.  I have seen negative comments about it being a two step process, or it hurting sensitive skin.  I don&#x27;t believe those comments.  My wife&#x27;s middle name is \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot;....from her stomach and teeth to her hair and skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She says IF you follow the directions it is extremely nice to the skin, and as an added benefit.....it actually works.  And it works well.  She reports that she did not get her typical red burning feeling that she usually gets when using hair removal creams on her upper lip area.  No extra lotions needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO again......No burning sensation, just smooth skin!</li>
    <li> This product gets 3 stars because it&#x27;s def easy on the skin no irritation or redness but it does not completely remove all the hairs :(</li>
    <li> This is finally a simple and fast solution to facial hair. I use it on my upper lip and a little on the chin and it only takes 10 minutes, the results are perfect and there are no irritations whatsoever. I can highly recommend this product to any woman with sensitive skin because it will not hurt, burn or irritate her. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and have never tried things like this because I had a bad experience with Nair when I was a teen. However I&#x27;ve been waxing and that&#x27;s no walk in the park so figured it was high time to try something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My problem area is the upper lip. When applied, it felt cool and tingly. There was no burning sensation until I tried to wipe it off and even then, it wasn&#x27;t bad at all. In all, I would say I had no adverse reactions and my skin was smooth afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However the result felt like a *very* close shave. And of course the hair grew back pretty quick and I got \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; which was a bit unattractive. So in the end, even though this proved to be a positive experience, I&#x27;ll still stick to waxing.</li>
    <li> Product arrived as stated. This works wonderful and so easy. Product does not burn as others do. i reccommend this product.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product.  I have sensitive skin and EVERY time I went for a lip wax, I ended up with white heads/pimples for about 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I dreaded having this procedure, but hated the hair more.  I was reluctant to try this product on my face b/c of my sensitive skin, but&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give it a try and I am so glad I did.  It is so quick, so effective and my skin is not red at all after.  On top of those&lt;br /&gt;great results, the hair regrowth seems to be slowed down.  It&#x27;s been weeks, and I only see a few hairs that have regrown back.  With my waxes,&lt;br /&gt;I would see all the hairs shortly after, this is quite an improvement.  I don&#x27;t know if this is an intended effect or just incidental, but I&lt;br /&gt;am really enjoying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All products are not for all people, but this one is especially good for me.</li>
    <li> does what it says it will do .. and there isn&#x27;t any burning whatsoever that I could make out.  I love that you apply a layer of protective cream before applying the actual hair removal. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> This product is only moderately effective.  It is gentle to the skin, but not that great at hair removal, especially if the hair is coarse in the least.  In my opinion, it is not worth the cost.</li>
    <li> Dont buy this it doesn&#x27;t work at all. I left it on for 15 mins and it didn&#x27;t touch one hair..big waste of money...</li>
    <li> This product is NOT GENTLE  -  This product gave me severe dry red skin and peeling for over a week....I would never use it again.</li>
    <li> I bought this TWIN Pack from Costco for a really good deal (with coupon discount!!), you can&#x27;t beat Costco price! I tried it yesterday by following the simple steps as instructed. The cream smells really good and it feels nice and cool after put it on my upper lip. I left it on for 10 minutes, even though the instruction said 6-8 min because it did not burn my skin at all. After 10 min, i wiped it off with a damp tissue and all the hair came out on the tissue easily!! AMAZING!! My skin feels smooth and I actually felt a little bit of tingling burn during the last minute but I simply compress the skin with an ice pack for only a minute or two after rinsing, and there is no sign of burn, rash nor redness!! Finally, no more pain and bleeding everytime I wax. I love it and was so excited to try on my eyebrow bone. It worked and got the same result as upper lip!! Very impress, will definitely recommend to everyone!!</li>
    <li> purchased in sept, but just pulled out to use. product box was completely empty, cant return because to long. a total lost for me. Empty box!!</li>
    <li> Just completed my first full application.  I have very fine, light facial hair.  Followed instructions carefully and left it on 8 minutes.. result... no hair removed.  Went online to see if it required several treatments and it appears from the reviews that at least some hair should have come off.  Will try one more time in a couple of days and change my rating if anything changes.  Very disappointed.  I am a long time Olay product user and this is my first bad experience. Second try.. followed instructions as before but put a thicker layer of the removal cream on.  Some hair was removed BUT I have four areas of 2nd degree burns.  Five days later and I am still dealing with peeling skin and worried about long term areas scaring and redness.  Will not use this product again.</li>
    <li> Even though I followed the directions to a T this product did not work, and on top of that it burnt my face. I did test it the night before I used it and did not receive any reaction from it. The night I used it I didn&#x27;t every thing right. I left it on 7 minutes and it burnt my skin kinda like a sun burn and did not remove all of the hair.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I first saw this product was available. I am less than excited after having used it several times. I have tried numerous products to get rid of my facial hair, with the ONLY thing really working being electrolysis. But I had hopes. (I am also one of the ones with course hair, so I seem to have the same results as others who do not have fine hair.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read and followed, to the letter, the directions to use the product on my upper lip. After 10 minutes, the product got rid of some of the hair, not all. I would have been OK with that, but the next day I had stubble that I could feel. I figured I had done something wrong, so the next time, double checked the instructions, tried again, and had the same results. Again, I figured it was me, so the next time, I tried using the cream without the protective balm. I had a little bit of stinging, but worth it if it worked. Same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday, I tried the product on an area where I have fine hair and on my upper lip as well. The fine hair is gone; my upper lip is starting to feel like 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hey, I&#x27;m self-conscious enough about my hairy face. I would rather wax than have man stubble.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product from a large retailer, hoping to get a good product. I am fair skinned and purchased the fine/medium hair removal kit. I made sure prior to using the product I did not exfoliate up to two days before using it. I like the idea that there was a skin protection balm stick with the product. I rubbed the stick (reminds me of the lipstick used with Revlon 24 hr. lip stains)on the areas that I wanted to treat and then followed the directions to rub it in. I could see the hairs clearly. I then put the removing cream on those areas and waited only 6 minutes. I could feel a slight burning sensation, but nothing else. The hairs came off just fine. It left my skin a little red. However, by the next day, I noticed my skin in the areas that I used it, had a very very dry feel- as if it had been burned. I exfoliated the following morning and realized that it was a deeper burn than I thought. It took my skin about 4 days to recover properly. I am not going to use this product again. I gave it two stars because it did remove the hair, but will not use it again on my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> gentle on the face not harsh to the delicate skin, I use it once a month. would buy again when needed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it regularly to remove fine hair from upper lips, it doesn&#x27;t do a great job, leaves me with a few strands of fine hair here and there and then I reapply another coating to remove the rest. Takes me easily more than 30 mins to finally get the job done.</li>
    <li> I usually never write reviews but...I bought this product because I love the other products I use from \\&quot;Olay.\\&quot;  So my thinking was yipee, I trust them and this will be good.  However, I was disappointed!  It did not remove the hair above my lip.  It only took away a few. The product was expensive and I would not buy it again.  I am looking for another product that will work.</li>
    <li> I purchased this from Amazon after reading several reviews about it. I usually wax my face, but wanted to try something new as the waxing sometimes leaves me with reddened skin and ingrown hairs. I am very happy with it - its quite gentle and effective. I have found that the protective balm is not necessary for me, as I have no reaction to the hair remover when directly applied. I would definitely recommend trying this only a small area of skin first however...as you may be more sensitive. My only complaint is that my hair regrows fairly quickly - I need to use this about every 2-3 weeks and if I was really self-conscious, I would probably use it every week. As a hair remover gel, however, this is the best I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
    <li> This product, which is way over priced, did not remove a single hair! The second and third time I tried it, again I couldn&#x27;t find one hair removed. Save your money.</li>
    <li> so i tried this and it honestly didnt work.. it made my lip VERY smooth but it hardly got rid of anythig. it got rid of the peach fuzz thats about it LOL. i tried it again i left it only for 10 mins and i didnt put alot of the first on so i know i did it right. i will try this product again but it didnt remove the hair that i wanted to remove. i do not have thick hair or anything so i dont know why it didnt remove and it kinda made my lip red. but it smells nice and maybe it works for some peope but it didnt work for me</li>
    <li> Follow the directions by first testing for sensitivity.  Then applying just as they direct and you will be very happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;Far less then paying to have this done.  I have blonde hair and the hair on my face is very light and fine.  Loved it!</li>
    <li> I have tried this product 3 different times following the directions each time and it did absolutely nothing.  I normally love Olay products so thought this would work for sure!  I tried it on my upper lip and chin and the only result it had was the burning sensation it left after I removed the product. I do not recommend this product to anyone!  Complete waste of money!  I spent $36 for nothing!</li>
    <li> Olay Smooth Finish Facial Hair Removal duo works like the cheaper brands, although Olay did add the moisturizing tube for you.  It does get rid of most hair with the exception of the very fine (no problem for me anyway) and the stubborn coarse (I just tweeze them).  Next time I think I will save money and buy another brand at the local Walmart or Drug Store.</li>
    <li> I wish that I would have read the reviews on here before I purchased this product.  It did not work for me at all.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have used this twice... yes, it is best to put the protective cream on in a thin layer, slighlty beyond the area you are planning to defoliate.  It is important to put the defoliant on in two layers to obtain a sufficiently thick cover, no gaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned that my skin would be irritated.  There wasn&#x27;t any reddening where I used both products but in one small place where I exceeded the protection from the cream, I had a small reddened area that took two days to fully clear &amp; responded well to otc steroid cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did it remove hair?  You bet, but not coarse hair, which I didn&#x27;t expect it to do but tried it there anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My treated skin feels smoother than it has since childhood!  Will continue to use this product; it is easier and more effective than NAIR and a few others that I have tried.</li>
    <li> I tried this product hoping it would help me with my hirsutism - male pattern hair growth - that is extremely embarrassing to deal with.  I have to shave like a man and it&#x27;s humiliating and requires special accommodation when I travel (i.e. making sure I have a private bath area where I can do this without everyone else knowing about it).  Unfortunately, this product is really geared towards your everyday, average woman&#x27;s peach fuzz, not coarser hair due to hormone issues (I have PCOS which is commonly associated with hirsutism).  I&#x27;ve tried everything and hoped this would be different, but it&#x27;s not.  So back to shaving with an electric razor I go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To Olay - there are millions of women who live with hirsutism and need some kind of treatment other than a prescription product like Vaniqa.  Introduce something that can help us and you will forever gain my loyalty.  I am tired of living with this embarrassing problem.</li>
    <li> Product works very well for sensitive skin and removes thicker, darker hair better than other products I have previously tried including waxing. Did not irritate skin or have an offensive odor. Pain free hair removal. Would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> I tried it just now.  I have fine very blond peach fuzz that I don&#x27;t worry about much and random darker more coarse hairs on my chin and neck and a couple on my cheek.  The cream removed all the peach fuzz, which is great, but most of the coarser dark hairs were left behind.  I thought maybe they were medium hair, but I&#x27;ll try the coarse cream before I make a judgement.  I&#x27;ve never used anything like this on my face before, only home wax kits.</li>
    <li> I tried this product and would not recommend it for those with sensitive skin.  It seemed to burn more than other hair removal products I have used on my legs and my skin was stinging and a little red for a day after use.  Additionally, it didn&#x27;t 100% remove the hair.  There was still a light stubble vs. being 100% removed.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, 2-step process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wet my face with warm water before use, which isn&#x27;t in the directions, yet from using other products &amp; having wax done, I did it out of habit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just put on step 1 (skin protectant), massage in circles, remove excess, if any, then&lt;br /&gt;Step 2 is to add the hair removal cream. Put it on gently, wait about 8-10 minutes, then remove with a wash cloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERY easy clean-up... Far easier than even sugaring &amp; FAR more than wax. No pulling or tugging (or \\&quot;lifting\\&quot; or skin tearing that can happen with wax!) Works GREAT on even thin skin! Wax &amp; sugar involves pulling &amp; tugging, which can&#x27;y be good for any skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The protectant keeps the hair remover from redness &amp; burning that used to happen with single-step products even for legs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product! Has enough for a few applications of entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have you test, which you should always do with any new skin product. VERY gentle &amp; easy to use. Where was this years ago? No need for painful, or at least uncomfortable tugging or redness/irritation from chemicals. Nice product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lasts as long as waxing or sugaring with enzymes afterwards! Nice surprise!</li>
    <li> When using a product such as this, it is always wise to first the directions. I did, and lo and behold, even though I was all set to chemically remove some hair with this cream, I was told to first test a spot on my arm, and wait 48 hours. I did. Two days later, I tried the lip hair. Truthfully, I could not stand the strong and nasty chemical smell to keep this product on my face as long as recommended. Also, I was beginning to feel a tingle in my skin. Not wanting to be sick from the smell or burn my skin, I quickly wiped away the cream and hair, the rinsed and washed my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked, as promised. It works longer than my usual at-home waxing. Those are good things, for which I gave this product a 3-star rating. I can&#x27;t give any more for the following reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be using it again. The smell was terrible. I don&#x27;t like the idea do using chemicals on my face, either. In addition, this cannot be used for eyebrows. That means, that if you are someone who does hair removal from the lip and brows, you still need a separate product for your brows. I prefer something that can be used for more than one thing. Finally, as per the directions, you are advised to do the 48  hour skin test every time you use the product. For some, this may not be a big deal, but for me, it is a hassle and one too many steps to have to take.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I was extremely disappointed. The wax is smooth and goes on easily, also does a great job of protecting the skin, but the product itself is kinda bad. It only removed about 30% of the hair I applied it to, you need ALOT to make sure it doesn&#x27;t dry to fast, and if you accidently get it on ANY skin that&#x27;s not covered in wax, it will burn through your skin. I do not recommend it, huge disappointment and wast of money.</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed. Maybe I didn&#x27;t prep correctly but my skin was a little irritated by this hair removal cream. My mother used it and it worked fine on her. I don&#x27;t plan on buying again but she will.</li>
    <li> I have never tried an Olay product before. I saw the commercial and decided to give it a try. I have a disorder that causes rapid facial hair growth. I knew some of the hair I had was coarse and some was not. I decided to give it a try anyway. I used this on my upper lip and I am very pleased with the results. Only use one swipe of the balm as directed and go further than the area you plan on hair removing. If you have lots of darker hair, like myself, you will want a nice thick coat of the remover and you will want to wait the 10 minutes. The first smell was a little strong (mostly because it was below my nose) but it quickly faded and left no after smell. It did not break out my skin, or leave redness. The hair was removed completely. The disorder I have causes the hair to grow back either the evening I use a remover or early the next morning, but I noticed after using Olays product, only about 2 little hairs on the edge of where I removed, appeared the next evening. So the hair remover worked! and worked longer than most I have tried. I am quite pleased. I recommend this if you have tried others and not had success. It is worth the money, at least for me because I was having to tweeze and bleach, or wax almost daily before. I can let it go for at least a week now except for the couple hairs on the edge (I will extend my remover coverage further to the edges this time and see if it makes a difference for the stray hairs)</li>
    <li> This Olay stuff is like a miracle in a tube!! I have super, super sensitive skin so all the nair, waxing at home, plucking, waxing in the salon, waxing in the salon with the special wax for sensitive skin! EVERYTHING made me break out or left huge rash-like irritation until the hair started to grow back. The Removeral Duo works effectively as well quickly and although it is a little pricey for my taste, the spike it gave my confidence is well worth the twenty bucks.</li>
    <li> Maybe if you just have soft, light growth above your lip this product may keep it at bay for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;Will not work on anything thicker.&lt;br /&gt;The application method is really great.&lt;br /&gt;So maybe okay for just for someone just starting facial hair removal.</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping it would help with facial hair but found that it doesn&#x27;t remove the hair as it says it would do.  Don&#x27;t waste your money; not worth it and doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I have used less expensive products and my face was burned, this product did also burn it, however much less. Perhaps, I need to learn to use it better. It is important to not leave it on longer than recommended. I do my whole face so in the area you begin it needs to come off first.</li>
    <li> I liked the fact that it had the skin cream to prepare your skin. But its not for the stiff hair. I have no problem with the fine stuff. I thought maybe I had finally found somthing to take care of my hair but I guess not this time. But I like all your other products.</li>
    <li> It works very well for me. I am glad that I can order it form the internet as I can no longer buy it at  retail outlets.</li>
    <li> I was surprised with some of the reviews that this would work as well as it did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually use an epilator, but it just seems like it doesn&#x27;t get the hair close enough to the skin and I have to do it often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lasted a couple weeks and now I have a few longer growths that need done again.  I am pleased with this though and it is definitely less painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, my skin always gets irritated and broke out for a few days after using the epilator, but I had no noticeable problems at all with the Olay.</li>
    <li> Really like the product- works on sensitive skin; the balm is great; hair removal is lasting- 2 weeks in and no regrowth.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to remove the fuzz on my cheeks, chin, and under my lower lip.  I used the primer, and a thin layer of the remover.  It was on most of my face, below my eyes. Again, a thin coating, nothing like the photo directions show. I used a timer and wiped the remover off w/ a damp, soft, face cloth. I was amazed. The hair was gone and my face was not bright red or irratated. I used it about a month ago and there is little if any regrowth, yet.  I keep looking for this product in the stores, I haven&#x27;t seen it.  Just purchase on line, it is worth having on hand.</li>
    <li> I am a woman who has suffered with excessive chin hair growth for years now.  I initially started with chemical depilatories, but I suffered with extreme chemical burns.  That is when I turned to the pain of waxing.  Though waxing removed even the most course hair, I now have scars from burned skin and ingrown hair bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just when I vowed to never wax again, I found Olay Smooth Finish Facial Hair Removal Duo.  Though, as stated within previous customer reviews, this product does not remove course hair (one would have to grab some tweezers for that!), I can say that I am quite pleased with the appearance and feel of my skin after treatment.  I even used this product above my upper lip (the most sensitive of areas), and had no problems with skin irritation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kudos to the product development team at Olay for an effective depilatory without the burns and stench! Know that I&#x27;m looking forward to Olay Smooth Finish Facial Hair Removal Duo for course hair!</li>
    <li> I am a HUGE fan of Olay products....this has me second guessing my choice of beauty lines.&lt;br /&gt;I had better luck with a five dollar hair remover!!!</li>
    <li> I expected this product to be much more gentle.  I followed the instructions completely.  When I used it on my face, it did remove the hair, but also burned me.  Unfortunately, I could not feel the burning sensation until I began removing it.  Even though I used a tissue to take it off, it felt like steel wool scraping my face.  Once I finally got it all off, it stung so bad I wanted to scream.  I rinsed for a long time with cool water, which only helped as long as I kept it up.  Finally ended up slathering the area with A&amp;D ointment (it was the most appropriate thing I had lying around), which I had to keep on all day.  Most of the affected area remained red for 2 days. It then became dry and flakey.  After about a week of intense moisturizing it&#x27;s mostly back to normal except for one spot under my chin that was burned so badly that it was raw and scabbed over (looked a bit like a bad rug burn). I think I must not have covered that spot as well with the balm.  It is healed now, but pretty hyperpigmented (hopefully not scarred).  The only positive thing I can say is that it didn&#x27;t have a super strong odor like most hair removal creams do.  All in all, huge disappointment.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife, so I am just putting her comments in this review.  She was definitely interested in trying this hair removal product because she has enjoyed one of their wrinkle creams.  Upon the first application she said there was no discomfort.  Many of these creams can be irritating to her skin.  She said that the cream removed most of the hair from the area it was applied to, but there were still a couple of stubborn hairs that would not go away.  I suggested that maybe she would need multiple applications, but unfortunately even after a second application some of the hairs remained.  So, in general the product worked gently.  Unfortunately, it seems to be too gentle if you have some stubborn hairs.</li>
    <li> First of all, the positives:&lt;br /&gt;Low odor -has a slight chemical odor like other depilatories but this isn&#x27;t as strong which is good as you may be using it just under your nose)&lt;br /&gt;Application- easy and you don&#x27;t have to get it on your hands&lt;br /&gt;Consistency- the balm and the cream feel luxurious when apply them&lt;br /&gt;Effectiveness- took off hair on all areas I applied it to (around mouth, below nose, jawline&lt;br /&gt;Gentleness- my skin was not red or irritated or dried out after using this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving this 5 stars because the only real negative I could find was the fault of my own body and RX medication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair removal only lasted a couple of days for me, around the same as shaving or using a motorized epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT I am under the impression that the smooth results should last longer than that.&lt;br /&gt;I have been on oral steroids for over a year to help treat Rheumatoid Arthritis.  I am tapering down now, but in general I find the biggest side effect of the medication is that I have noticeable facial hair (fine and blond but abundant) particularly around my mouth and on my jawline.  My hair re-growth is incredibly rapid, which may be why Olay Smooth Finish didn&#x27;t keep my hair at bay for a full 3 days before having noticeable regrowth.  The hair removal duo were so gentle and easy to use that I would consider just applying it more frequently, but the box says that you should do a patch test 48 hours prior to using it EVERY TIME you use it.  That means I&#x27;d be applying the stuff constantly, and I am concerned about over-sensitizing myself to the ingredients with that much usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot wait to revisit this product once I am off the prednisone. I&#x27;ll update at that time.</li>
    <li> As stated by the manufacturer, this product is for fine hair on upper lip and jawlines.  This will not work on chin growth, underarms or any type of coarse hair.  I used this product on different hair growth like arm, underarm, chin and leg and it DOES NOT WORK, so don&#x27;t even try. Given the above fact regarding the product, this new Olay product does EXACTLY what it advertises.  I liked the skin protecting balm that is applied BEFORE you put the depilatory cream on your face.  I am posting the directions in my review and as long as you are following the simple directions, this does remove the hair it advertises it will.  I also didn&#x27;t mind the smell of the cream as it is very mild but does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lightly apply the Skin Guard Balm across the middle of the areas you wish to treat. Be sure the layer is thin, and apply it only once for effective hair removal. Massage Skin Guarding Balm Use your fingers to massage the balm into your skin, going beyond the area you wish to treat. Massage for 20 seconds in a circular motion. This ensures there is a pre-treatment layer to keep the Hair Removal Cream from coming in direct contact with your skin, and that hairs aren&#x27;t overly coated. 2 REMOVE THE HAIR Apply Hair Removal Cream Apply a layer of Hair Removal Cream to your fingertip (small grape size for upper lip treatment) and immediately smooth over the area to be treated. For the product to work effectively, cover the skin completely with a thick layer but do not rub it in. Use only with the Skin Guarding Balm provided. Wash hands immediately and thoroughly. Let process for 6-8 minutes. Leave on longer for thicker hair, but do not exceed 10 minutes. Remove Hair / Cream After 6-8 minutes, gently remove cream with a tissue or cotton ball. Rinse your skin thoroughly with lukewarm water and pat dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, simple, AND effective...</li>
    <li> Ok...totally was optomistic, and now fully disappointed and regret it!  Followed all directions (skin test, etc), left the cream on for 7 minutes.  It removes hair alright...but just the fine light colored little hairs.  So whats left behind are the darker ones, which were the whole reason for using this in the first place.  These aren&#x27;t coarse hairs (like leg or underarm where you shave all the time)...now I will have to go have this ugly dark \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; removed at the salon.  Would give no stars but thats not an option</li>
    <li> This product is AWESOME b/c I can use it right before I go to work or out with my fiance or friends for dinner, and I experience no irritation or redness WHATSOEVER!  Finally I don&#x27;t have to deal with the pain of waxing (redness, either) and I don&#x27;t have to deal with the constant irritation of Nair!!!</li>
    <li> Olay usually provides much better product than this one.  I&#x27;ve used it twice and have been unhappy with the results as it did not delete many of the facial hairs and for those remaining, it was difficult to pluck them with a tweezer because they were \\&quot;softened\\&quot; so much.  It also is a very expensive product for what it purports to do.</li>
    <li> I was nervous about trying this, because I didn&#x27;t want to get a big red rash or anything, but this went really well and worked remarkably effectively!&lt;br /&gt;The skin protecting balm stick has the consistency of a lip balm, and had a nice smell to it. I put that on first, and followed directions by gently rubbing it in and around for 20 seconds. Then I spread on the hair removal cream, quite thick in consistency, and left it for the recommended 6 minutes. I was nervous to leave it for longer, and the smell of the removal cream was a little on the chemical side. I wiped it off with a cotton ball, and rinsed, per instructions, and am really impressed at how thouroughly it removed the fine hairs above my lip! AND, no big red rash! I am always impressed with Olay stuff, use the Regenerist line of products, and this is another great item from them.</li>
    <li> When I heard Olay was coming out with this product I couldn&#x27;t wait to give it a try. So much so that I called their customer service to find out when it would be released in stores and decided I couldn&#x27;t wait so I ordered it online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I liked about this product is the ease of use and it is less painful than waxing.  The hair removal treatment (2nd step of the application) has a faint smell similar to that of Nair. After removing the treatment, I did have to rub the treated area to remove some of the hair but the courser hairs I had to tweeze. I experienced a slight irritation which may have been contributed to the product or could have been from rubbing the treated area afterward but it went away soon after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the results, the treated area was smooth as the name suggests and I found it to inhibit hair growth for probably a little over a week.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and am allergic to almost everything :( I&#x27;d stopped using similar products like Nair and Sally Hansen for the face because of the inescapable stinging, itching, and redness. I was pleasantly surprised when Olay allowed me to wipe hair off without any irritation! Definitely spread the protecting balm liberally, and don&#x27;t leave on past the recommended time.  I keep the cream on for 8 min, then clean up any stragglers with a tweezer.  Great product!</li>
    <li> No better than the under 5 dollar products you can buy and not have to order.  Very disappointed and don&#x27;t recommend buying this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and was tempted to return it after reading negative reviews. However, I decided to give Olay a chance. This product removed fine hair on my upper lip quite well and I am very pleased. However, I did get some of the cream on my lip where it caused temporary sores so be careful. I followed directions and left on for 10 min.&lt;br /&gt;Not much cream is required so hopefully it will last quite awhile.</li>
    <li> While always pleased with Olay products, this one didn&#x27;t live up to its expectations with me.  It worked, albeit in a very minor way, but then I don&#x27;t have a major upper lip hair problem.  Perhaps, it&#x27;s just me!</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this product.  It never occurred to me that the only hair that it would actually remove was the baby-fine, wispy, light-colored hair.  Anything that actually needed removing was left behind.</li>
    <li> After reading several raves about this in magazines, I finally ordered this and decided to try it out. My facial hair is very fine peachfuzz. I also use Retin-A at night and was worried about waxing. My skin is not over-sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions and just tried it out on my upper lip and this worked pretty well! It was easy to use and I didn&#x27;t experience any burning or redness or irritation afterwards. The smell wasn&#x27;t bad and the product was thick enough that it didn&#x27;t slide down from where I put it. I will be using this regularly from now on!</li>
    <li> My sideburns grow long and out of control, so I usually trim them and wax the lower area. I also wax the hair right below my eye on my upper cheek bone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway the wax was way too harsh! I would always look like I was sunburned after waxing under my eyes and I would breakout with zits right below my sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw commercials for Olay hair removal and bought it in desperation to stop the constant breakouts, despite the high price tag. I&#x27;m actually really glad I did--not only is my skin smooth and rash-free where I put the cream, the skin below my sideburns is completely clear of zits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only left it on about 8 minutes and all the hair wiped away easily. Thank you, Olay!</li>
    <li> It works.just like a cream hair remover. Too much money for this item. Wasnt worth the price. I can go buy 2 bottles of nair.for the same price.</li>
    <li> I very rarely write reviews but I just had to on this! I really didn&#x27;t think it would work but for the price, I thought why not? I was tired of the wax yanking my head off when I had it done and sometimes it would leave a sore. This really works am so shocked and pleased that it did! No more wax for me!!!&lt;br /&gt;I did follow instructions. I did a small spot to make sure it wasn&#x27;t going to irritate skin, then I did my entire upper lip. I massaged the balm like it said for 20 secs and I did put a heavy coat of cream on and I left it for the full 10 minutes. If I were a celebrity Olay I&#x27;d endorse it for you!!! Thanks again Oil of Olay!!!!!</li>
    <li> My Nair cream stopped working for my upper lip hair so I tried this product. I had high hopes for it but, unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations. I left it on for the maximum time of 10 minutes and the only thing it got rid of it was the fine hairs. For the medium thickness hairs, it did nothing. The only good thing about this is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to burn and sting as much as the Nair did.</li>
    <li> I used this for the first time today.  I do not have a crazy stache or anything but some darker baby hairs on my upper lip, enough to be noticable.  So, applied to prep, massaged it in, put on the cream, and it did what it said it would in 8 minutes leaving only a slight redenning on my upper lip.  I think its worth the price, its a decent product and I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I have had to have my upper lip and chin waxed and every time, I break out or have a rash for a few days. I decided to try this product after reading the reviews, before I paid $50 for a facial to remove my hair. I am over 50 and have the chin stubble.&lt;br /&gt;I used this last night and on my upper lip, chin and side of my face.&lt;br /&gt;It was FANTASTIC!!!!! I have a few (5-6) coarse hairs  that  I had to pluck. All the fine hair was gone.&lt;br /&gt;I did not feel any stinging or did I have redness.&lt;br /&gt;When you use it, be sure that you put on an ample amount as shown in the picture of the directions.</li>
    <li> This was my first time using a hair removal cream so i was a bit skeptical. I wasn&#x27;t even sure I was using it right because I didnt know how big a \\&quot;small grape\\&quot; size is. But, it worked! The skin is smooth and hair free, with NO irritation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside was the smell. But it was very worth it to not have to go to salons and get a wax anymore. I&#x27;m very happy I tried this product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  It provides a soft, luxurious feeling to the face and my mineral makeup looks like silk over it.  And at a FABULOUS price!  Would buy this product again!</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews, (some were negative) I still ordered (a couple of months ago).  I waited until I really needed my upper lip hair gone.  With slight trepidation I decided to go ahead and try it.  I read the directions, and practiced the motions before even trying it.  Once I actually tried it, I was really happy I bought this product.  Most of the hair came off, and the few stubborn ones were really easy to tweeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried it on my chin, I can tweeze the random hairs with little trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy again.  Thank you for making this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Practice first!</li>
    <li> Olay&#x27;s Smooth Finish Facial Hair Removal Kit consists of two items. First is a smell-less guarding balm that feels like vaseline. It&#x27;s important to use as little as possible and spread it thin, otherwise it will also protect the hair that you are trying to remove. Second is the actual removal cream that dissolves the hair. In the first few minutes, it was basically odorless, but there will be some small chemical smell after about 7 minutes when the chemical starts getting concentrated. Olay&#x27;s instruction says leave it on for 10 minutes before you wipe it off. In my first use, I started to feel some tinkering sensation on my skin around 8.5-9 minutes, but for the sake of experiment I decided to leave it on until a full 10 minutes has passed. Unfortunately, while it did dissolve a noticeable amount of facial hair, it still left some thicker hair for me to tweeze out. In my second use a month later I decided to use a bit more of the guarding balm and indeed I didn&#x27;t feel anything even after 10 minutes. However, perhaps because there was more guarding balm this time, the hair removal effect was not as noticeable as last time. It seems really tricky to get the guarding balm amount just right, and I am still experimenting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price and its mostly odorless facial hair removal experience, I think this is a great product. However, don&#x27;t throw away your tweezer just yet. :P</li>
    <li> If I could just write one word for this it would be AMAZING! I had my doubts due to things like this not working in the past but this one did. I put it on for the full 10min and it all came off. I didn&#x27;t get the whole area like I tried too but where I put I did get it, it all came off, so just a few plucks to get the rest!! It&#x27;s just as smooth as if I just had it waxed. The smell isn&#x27;t bad at all, and super easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oil of Olay if you read this, if you could develop one for the eyebrows I would buy it forever!! Thank you for this one :)</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, and this product did a great job removing fine hair without hurting my skin.  You have to follow the directions exactly - mainly make sure that the protective balm is on a wider area than what you are planning to treat so you don&#x27;t miss any spots.  Did a great job getting rid of the \\&quot;peach fuzz\\&quot; quickly - still smooth almost 2 weeks later.</li>
    <li> Worked well. Non-irritating, at least for me.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used a product like this before for my face (my upper lip hair is generally fine, but a bit too \\&quot;fluffy\\&quot; at the outer corners of my mouth for my liking).  I have dry, sensitive skin so was worried about the results.  But this product worked well.  I followed the instructions (massage in a thin coat of the protective balm - felt like Chapstick), then put on a thick coat of the remover and leave on for 8 minutes.  When I first put it on there was a very faint smell of lemon and Nair, but VERY faint (and I have a picky nose).  Then I smelled and felt nothing (no tingling). After 8 minutes, I wiped off and rinsed and it felt great - no redness at all.  I&#x27;ll definitely use it again (looks like there&#x27;s enough here for several uses).  I give it 4 stars because it seems pretty pricey for what it is, but I have no complaints on how well it works!</li>
    <li> This product worked great on the fine hair around the lips.  However, it didn&#x27;t work on the coarser chin hair.  I&#x27;m a fair skinned redhead and I didn&#x27;t get any reaction or soreness.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the product and am looking forward to getting the hair removal kit for coarser hair when it comes out.</li>
    <li> I love this product! This is the only way I remove my upper lip and chin facial hair now. To describe myself, I have fine, very light blonde hair on my face, interspersed with some individual dark coarse hairs on my chin, which I cannot stand. I&#x27;m constantly plucking those buggers. When I first started removing facial hair, I got a upper lip and chin wax. Not good! My face was super red afterwards and makeup just irritated it. My fair skin only made the waxed areas appear worse. The other less expensive hair removal creams didn&#x27;t improve the situation...that&#x27;s how I found out I was allergic to Nair. Then Olay introduced this gem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the balm helps so that the hair removal cream doesn&#x27;t get into close contact with your skin, causing irritation. I work the cream with my fingertips, creating a thick, even layer on my upper lip, corners of my mouth, and chin area. The box says to leave it on for 6-8 minutes, and I use the full 8 minutes to insure that the cream has had time to penetrate the coarser hairs. Then using 1 paper towel, I wipe it away. Sometimes, I miss a few hairs and just end up plucking those out with a tweezers. This will last me 2-3 weeks between treatments, and the whole package will last me 6-7 treatments. Definitely worth it. And it&#x27;s cheaper on Amazon than at the drugstore. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product was exactly as described.  It was so easy to use and I had fantastic results. I have definitely recommended this to all of my family and friends.</li>
    <li> does the job, but I haven&#x27;t figured out the correct timing yet. I have used twice and it appears I should be going a bit longer than their 10 minute max. I used to use a product called &amp;#34;better off&amp;#34;, which isn&#x27;t made anymore, and this is comparable &amp; close enough to the same results that I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> This product is pretty good at fulfilling its&#x27; promises - hair removal without irritation.  The shortfall lies in the pen that contains the protective layer.  There is not enough of it, and the pencil runs out long before the rest of the product.</li>
    <li> Love this item .  I have very sensitive fair skin , so I couldnt wax the area .  This product is perfect for me cause I have very fair blonde thin facial hair .  I dont think it will work for coarser hair just my opinion</li>
    <li> Bought this at local drugstore for$25.I have fine blonde upper lip hair I wanted gone and it removed like 98% .Feel like I have a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow on my stache!First time I left on min. amount of time and thought that was why I had a little bit left.Tried again for max and same result!Except then it burned and a little bit got out of balm area and left what looks and feels like a burn.Seriously my hair wouldn&#x27;t be considered medium and it did not work.Be cheaper and work better to just bic it like a man:(</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed.  I really was hoping this product would work on me.  I tried it on my upper lip  but after 10 minutes (longer than the packaging even suggests)  not one hair was removed.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I use it on a regular basis now and love the results. Very little effort for smooth hair-free skin.</li>
    <li> Worked great! Would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> yes, very well. and the amazon&#x27;s customer service is very well</li>
    <li> I JUST finished using this product on my \\&quot;goatee\\&quot; of fine hair. It took all the fine hair off! I have a couple courser pieces left that I&#x27;m used to plucking anyway. It says to remove the cream gently from your skin but I had to rub in a circular motion.  I tink I got some removal cream on my lip as it&#x27;s burning slightly now.  The skin that was treated is kinda tingly....I think I will update this review after the next use...so far, quite good!</li>
    <li> I put the strips on my face waited the allotted time and no results. This was time and money wasted. I will never buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I have used Olay Product for about 10 years now and I have always had a great experience. So when I found out about this hair remover I thought it would be just as good. I was a little skeptical at first based on the fact that it was $23 but it was Olay so I felt it would be worth it. I take it home and follow the directions. I liked the balm you put on first because after I put on the cream I didn&#x27;t feel that tingle or burn like other products. So after keeping it on the recommended 10 minutes I take a cottonball and start to wipe it off. It removed very little hair and the hair that did come off it wasn&#x27;t the whole hair, it left stubble. The hair started growing back after only 4 days and since it didn&#x27;t get the whole hair some of the hairs are now ingrown and I will have to tweeze. I was very dissapointed and felt that I just wasted $23 on a product that made my hair problem worse. IF I COULD GET MY MONEY BACK I WOULD BE VERY HAPPY!! I guess it is back to Veet.</li>
    <li> Works fine, but way overpriced.</li>
    <li> I was very excited about the Olay facial hair removal because I was finally relieved that there was something simple and easy, however this product only wasted my time and money. I was nervous putting it on because I did not want my skin to have a reaction to the product and my face red all day. Not only did that not happen, but nothing else happened either. I followed the directions and left the cream on for the maximum amount of time, but after wiping it away, the hair was still there. I tried this two more times, in hope that I just applied too much of the step one cream, but I still had no results. I will definitely being calling the company to attempt to get my money back.</li>
    <li> After having my twins... the hair on my upper lip became course... bleaching, waxing etc. was too much and did not work well.  I used this product and my upper lip is as smooth as my babies butts!  Great/ easy solution.</li>
    <li> This makes my life so much simpler. Instead of waxing painfully, this is easy to apply and produce quick result.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin. I got a rash from every other hair removal product I have used. I put the protector on first and rub it in. Then I put a thick layer of cream on over it. I leave it on for 10 minutes and the. I wipe it off with a tissue. The hair really comes off and leaves my skin feeling moisturizer! The only problem I have had is when I applied the product to a part of my face where the hair was particularly thick. I repeated the process on this area and it worked liked a charm!</li>
    <li> Delivered to the door with no problems</li>
    <li> Was a lil nervous putting this on my face after a previous product left me uncomfortable but no discomfort here.</li>
    <li> Had never removed hair above my lip until I read about this product. It was simple and caused no skin irritation for me. Will continue using it</li>
    <li> When I requested this product, I was hoping to get a little something to remove the blond hairs on my upper lip.  They&#x27;re not that big of a deal, but it would be nice if they weren&#x27;t there.  However, after properly using this according to directions (allergy test first, natch), it didn&#x27;t seem to do much but make my skin very raw.  It wasn&#x27;t terrible, just a little rough and crusty (I seemed to be the only who noticed it - kind of similar to the way my skin gets in the middle of winter).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it again about 2 weeks later, after my upper lip was no longer red or crusty.  It seemed to remove a little more hair this time (I left it on for 10 minutes instead of 8), but it again made my skin crazy upset.  I have extra, extra sensitive skin, so I&#x27;ll bet this will be okay for other people.  But for sensitive skinned ladies like me, this just won&#x27;t cut it for the upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It DID work as advertised and without problems on the very light, very thin \\&quot;peach fuzz\\&quot; on the sides of my cheeks.  However, that hair doesn&#x27;t bother me in the least, so I don&#x27;t see a use for this in my life.</li>
    <li> I was not able to use this as I had a reaction to it.  It may work for most, but I assume my skin was just sensitive to it.  It removed hair, but left my skin burning and red for a several days.  I should have tested it on a small spot first, which is what I recommend that you do.</li>
    <li> I normally love Olay products but this didn&#x27;t work for me. I followed the directions exactly and I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many facial hair removers and consistently was left with red, irritated skin...Not so with Olay....the duo effectively removed my facial hair and left my skin soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> It works okay and without harshness to my skin. Just wish the results lasted longer. It seems the more often one removes facial hair the more it comes back stronger.</li>
    <li> This product was more comforting to my skin than others on the market, but it did not remove the facial hair completely.  I still had to resort back to the irritating other products.</li>
    <li> This product turned out to be a very nice surprise. It not only dissolves away the hair on my lip, it also works for my eye brows. Sweet. My hair is light to medium in color, thickness, and coarseness.</li>
    <li> I have used the product 2 times, it worked at removing my facial hair, but I found that my hair is growing back longer and thicker than it was before, especially on areas where I accidently put the cream and didn&#x27;t really have \\&quot;hair\\&quot; in those spots before. Thankfully, my hair is blonde, but has anyone else had issues with hair growing back longer?  I thought the product was going to decrease the amount of my facial hair.  I wish I had not used it at all, and I am afraid to use it again even though I need it more now than when I first tried it.  I would appreciate some feedback on anyone who has used it more than once.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as smelly, but you get one quarter of the amount at three times the price of Nair or Sally Hansen and it does the same job, just takes longer.  I mean if you overprocess, that&#x27;s your fault.  Set a timer.  As for me, I&#x27;ve got better things to spend $20+ on.</li>
    <li> Very very disapointed.  I followed the instructions perfectly.  The product seemd to work. But, within a few minits when I felt my upper lip and chin gues what hair not removed.  I don&#x27;t know how you had so many 5 star responses.</li>
    <li> This product is working well for me.</li>
    <li> There was a good deal on this product and I bought two boxes.  This product is very gentle on your facial skin and there is a stick of skin protective balm to be used on sensitive areas. I will be buying this brand from now on, I would definitely recommend anyone buying this....  The Olay arrived before the date that was predicted.</li>
    <li> It is definitely not irritating to the skin which was a plus for me, but it did not remove the hair to create a smooth service. Sally Hansen does a better job, but it is much more irritating to the skin. So I guess you trade off one for the other.</li>
    <li> The product did just as it said it would.  It removed all the hair and did not burn or irritate my skin.  However, the product was not all I thought it would be.  Not only was my skin hairless for only two days before the hair started to grow back but there was also a stubble which I found to be more embarrassing than the hair.  I think the product is a good alternative to shaving very fine hair like mine but in the end, waxing is probably the best choice.</li>
    <li> For me it worked kind of the same as the other facial hair cream removers, it didn&#x27;t smell as much thou , it left about half of my lip hair some on my chin and some around my cheeks. It also irritated my face and it also burn not as much as other creams but it did, if I could give it a 2.5 stars that&#x27;s what i would of done I think I wont be buying this product again one is all out.</li>
    <li> Item does not work, did not take off hair. So frustrated, tried so many different products and nothing works but plucking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do I get my money back?</li>
    <li> I used this product, today, and am disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;It just did not do the job.  I will try again, in a few days, but am not optimistic.&lt;br /&gt;I will say that it did not irritate my skin and that it had very little scent...both good things.&lt;br /&gt;First time I&#x27;ve been disappointed in an Oil of Olay product.</li>
    <li> I am always on the lookout for something that will take care of the fine blonde hairs around my jaw line/lower cheek area.  Nair facial hair remover worked so-so, but would never get all of the hair off and smelled bad, along with some minor redness and irritation right after.  This Olay treatment worked okay, but it only lasted a few days.  There was no irritation at all and it didn&#x27;t have a noxious odor.  For the price I&#x27;ve paid for this, I&#x27;d expect it to last MUCH longer.  I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;d continue to pay this kind of money for only a 4 days resolution, but I&#x27;ll use the rest of the tube and see how it goes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used bleach but switched to depilatories several months ago. I tried Olay&#x27;s for the first time a few weeks ago. It is by far the best. I&#x27;m of South Asian descent, with  light brown skin and black hair on my upper lip and chin. Olay&#x27;s skin protecting balm and hair removal cream worked perfectly. I followed the directions exactly, and in 8--once even 9--minutes, the hair came off with a gentle massage of a dampened towel. The scent of the product is, for the first time in my use of depilatories, pleasant. My skin feels soft and smooth. I can go up to five days before needing to use it again. Wonderful product, I highly recommend it, it is worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> I am only 20 and started having facial hair problems around the time I started taking birth control at 18. I went on and off again and I&#x27;m guessing it messed up my hormones, and all of a sudden I have tons of peach fuzz on my face. Being that I&#x27;m so young I was so embarrassed and wished I could wear a mask. I waxed occasionally but hated waxing almost as much as my hairy face. It left me red and sticky sometimes didn&#x27;t even work. I decided that it&#x27;s silly to let something like this inhibit me and the same day I read reviews for this online. I didn&#x27;t want to wait to order it so I bought it at the drugstore for $30. $30 is about my max for a good pair of jeans, so this is a bit of a pinch but SO. WORTH. IT. I have naturally fine blonde hair but my body hair is thicker and darker so I opted for the medium to coarse. Plus, there was only one fine to medium box left and it looked like it had been opened. It was fate. I showered and used a face scrub, then used it right away. Follow the directions closely, and be mindful of where you apply the step 1 balm. It disappears once you rub it in and it would&#x27;ve been helpful to know exactly where it was to remove as much hair as possible without burning the non-balmed skin. Maybe mark the edges of the area you plan to defoliate with eyeliner? I riskily left it on for a good 10 minutes, the maximum time. It may have been a little longer (although I don&#x27;t suggest that!) even so I didn&#x27;t have any redness or pain. I rinsed with lukewarm water and then cold water. There was a slight tingling sensation a few minutes after I removed it but that was it!! No redness whatsoever!! I put makeup on and went to work shortly after. It&#x27;s like there was never any hair that at all. Completely smooth and fuzz free. I plucked a few strays but even so, results were better than anything else I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;m so happy. I finally feel confident and feminine and sexy again. Trust me it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> This stuff works really well-no negative side effects!</li>
    <li> This is my first time trying thing like this and I must say that it actually works! So Im happy:-) I dont actually bought mine through amazon but on my local groceries store. Was a bit nervous actually when I read all the bad comments about this stuff but I thought Im just going to try it since I already bought it. *oh btw, I always try to read all the bad comments first before the 5stars comments, so I dont expect too much*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I follow the instructions and yes it works! It kinda left a tiny bit of burning sensation on my skin now but probably because I wiped it with cotton ball with all the power I have *LOL* because after I read all the 1star comments that said it doesnt work made me think that I have to wipe it really hard from the skin to pluck all the hairs. *yes stupid me!*.. Wont do that again next time. I dont know how long this burning sensation will stay *i hope it will gone soon* or how long this skin will stay smooth, but for now all I can say: yes it works!</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me. It didn&#x27;t remove any hair that I saw and the smell for myself was too much (though it was probably pretty light of a smell compared to other products like this). The area where I used this felt weird after I wiped the product off... I can&#x27;t explain the feeling sorry . maybe my hair was too dark? I&#x27;m not sure,  but it just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> I have tried everything to get rid of facial hair. Most products  partially work and others work but leave your skin red and irritated and then some don&#x27;t work it all. I am glad to say that this product works wonders. It took off all of the fine hair and as of yet (3 weeks) there is no sign of it coming back. No redness. I even did my eyebrows and was extremely pleased.</li>
    <li> This is a VERY overpriced product. As a long time user of Olay products this was a huge disappointment. I suspect more than half the price can be attributed to the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;The skin guarding balm will last 40 years while the hair removal cream will be finished long before. But the most disappointing part is that I was not left with a &#x60;smooth finish&#x27; as the box promises. Some hair was left intact &amp; the rest was very unattractive stubble. I wrote to Olay about my dissatisfaction &amp; they promised a coupon which never arrived.</li>
    <li> After I used this product, the results were as I expected. The cream only removed 3/4 of the hairs on my upper lip even when I applied the recommended amount. I tried the product again after a few days (keep in mind I only had a few hairs left on my upper lip) and yet, the cream still didn&#x27;t remove the hairs. I ended up having to pluck the remaining hairs which took a while to do. So all in all,the results aren&#x27;t very good and the price is too high. I don&#x27;t suggest buying this product... unless the price drops down to a reasonable price... like $7 since that&#x27;s how much I think it&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> ,kinda of a mess to have to apply very time consuming but i guess if you don&#x27;t want to look like grizzly adams its a must</li>
    <li> For years I have used Sally Hansen creme hair bleach and Sally Hansen at-home wax strips to deal with the fine hair from my upper lip.  I was intrigued by this product when I first saw it advertised but was concerned that it would make my sensitive skin break out or that it wouldn&#x27;t work as well as the products I was used to.  I conducted the skin test twice just to make sure I wasn&#x27;t allergic--probably overkill but I have very sensitive skin and was a little terrified of having a rash on my upper lip!  Once the skin on my wrist had survived the two applications with no effects, I was ready to try this product for real.  The instructions for use are clear and concise--just apply the skin-protecting balm first and then apply the hair removal cream.  I left the cream on for 6 minutes (the minimum according to the directions) and then wiped off with a tissue before rinsing with cool water.  There was no burning sensation or unpleasant smell as there can be with bleaches.  The hair came off amazingly well--I read other reviews that said it didn&#x27;t remove all hair, and mine is all gone, but my hair is very fine.  Overall I&#x27;ve been pleased with this product, and I might try using it on the hair between my brows and on my jawline as well (even though the directions say not to...).</li>
    <li> Used this product EXACTLY as instructed, as the package explained... my face is red, weeping and I am in great pain.  NEVER USE THIS! Never again, walk away</li>
    <li> I have been wanting an alternative to waxing or threading and found this and was very happy with the results. I tried it for the first time 3 weeks ago and can just feel my hair growing back. Its not noticeable or thick so I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and it&#x27;s hard to find a hair removal kit that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. And when it&#x27;s facial hair, that can be embarrassing. This kit is awesome and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. No weird sensation, no redness, no hair. Perfect!</li>
    <li> This is well worth the money! The salons charge around $7 for your lip and $12 for you eyebrows. It pays for its self in just a few uses. It does a great job getting rid of unwanted facial hair and I love how much money I am saving. Plus I dont have to go in public with red upper lips or red eyebrows. I can do this in my own home at night. Its great!</li>
    <li> Did not completely remove hair as expected even though I followed the instructions 100%.</li>
    <li> Every time I saw my niece, she offered to pluck my chin hairs-which I never noticed till she pointed them out and then I was embarrassed by how long they were. I was thrilled to read about this product. I have very sensitive skin and I have had no irritation at all. It&#x27;s so easy to use and does such a good job, I make sure to use it once a month so my niece can have a glass of wine when she visits instead of plucking my chin</li>
    <li> Did not remove all the hair from my lip.and my lip was sore for 3 days. Won&#x27;t try it again.</li>
    <li> So far I am happy with my purchase. I was skeptical to use this product on my skin because I use acne medication but my skin reacted fine. I used the balm and kept the cream on for 8 minutes, next time I will keepit on for the full 10 minutes because there were a few hairs left behind, nothing too noticeable though. My skin was slightly iirritated for about an hour afterwards but I applied aloe Vera then and also overnight and woke up looking fine. Everyone&#x27;s skin reacts differently I wouldn&#x27;t brush this product off because of bad reviews, I would at least try it out, I think you will be happy.</li>
    <li> I love the way this made my upper lip and jawline look, no more pesky peach fuzz, lol. I especially liked how it does not burn or have a bad odor to it. My only caveat? My face feels odd, as if it is numb where I waxed it. I am only on day 2 of using this but it is making me a bit nervous. I did not overuse the product or put too much on either. I hope this goes away...</li>
    <li> I was really happy with this product.  I usually get my upper and lower lip waxed.  This time I decided to try this.  It was quick and painless and worked great!  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Since I buy so many of these items as gifts, I cannot report on how I personally like it since I&#x27;ve never used it.</li>
    <li> This product really works! Unfortunately nobody told me when you reach a certain age as a woman that you begin to grow facial hair so imagine my surprise when I realized I was working on a full manchoo! Needless to say I tried everything. From shaving, to lasers, to wax. Nothing seemed to really take me back to the smooth face of my youth. Till now the balm makes sure you don&#x27;t burn your skin and the treatment does everything that it says in the description. And after a few treatments the regrowth has slow down and the hair itself is way less noticeable! I totally recommend this product! It works on several different hair textures and thickness totally worth the buy!</li>
    <li> This product is a miracle for fine hair. I&#x27;ve got black, thin baby hairs on my upper lip--they&#x27;re not really visible, but they make makeup application a lot harder and more patchy. I tried waxing, but it was painful and red--and had to be done once a month! For $20 a go, that&#x27;s a lot of money for a college student to spend just on baby hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olay&#x27;s hair creme, however, works fantastically. For the same price as waxing, I get a kit that lasts me a year! I use this stuff every three to four weeks, and it&#x27;s usually enough to keep the hairs at bay. I can do this in my dorm room, too--and nobody has to see it, thank goodness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen a lot of negative reviews for this, though: I&#x27;d assume that this really only works well for slower-growing, finer hairs as opposed to thicker or faster-growing hair. Give it a try, regardless, though, because I&#x27;ve also found that it makes my upper lip hair grow in much slower!</li>
    <li> I been using this cream for about 3 years now. I use it once a month and leave it on for 8 minutes and it removes my upper lip and chin hair. It does tingle a bit, but it doesn&#x27;t burn. I always apply Aloe Vera gel ( alcohol free) right after to calm my skin. I&#x27;ve never broke out from using this product and I have a dark skin tone. I love how smooth my face looks and the more you use it the less facial hair grows over time.</li>
    <li> Good stiff, does exactly what it claims.  That&#x27;s all I have to say but this site wants more words so I&#x27;m trying to add more words but I really have nothing to say.</li>
    <li> Oil of Olay has been a mainstay in my family for years. When my brother first discovered it on my grandmother&#x27;s vanity, he smirked \\&quot;Grandma&#x27;s using Oil of Olay\\&quot;. But, Oil of Olay made her skin smooth and radiant.  So, now I use Oil of Olay products. Every product I&#x27;ve used has  been awesome...until I tried this Olay Smooth Finish Facial Hair Removal Duo.  I&#x27;m not a hairy girl, but fine hair above my lip has been the bain of my existence, so I thought this would solve my problem.  It made it worse!  I can feel the stubble bubbling up through my pores like in those old werewolf pictures, and I just used it yesterday. It&#x27;s insane! Imagine running your fingers over your lip doing a discount stubble check (sorry Aaron Rogers) just like an old man. After several applications, on several different occasions, this product has been slam dunked into file 13. Lesser priced products have worked better.  Save your money gals,this product is un-Olay-like,and P&amp;G should send this one back to the research lab.</li>
    <li> Just follow the simple directions.  It couldn&#x27;t be easier and it worked great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it once so far, and the results were very good. I followed directions perfectly, which meant putting on the protective coat before the hair removal. My upper lip started burning a little (bearable) at the five minute mark. After six minutes I wiped it off with a towel, and rinsed my upper lip well. About 90% of the hair was gone in the first two sections of my lip, and 50% was gone on the third section. Although I was worried about burning myself, I decided to repeat by putting more Olay on the third section which was hardly affected last time. This time, almost all of it was removed. My upper lip is now 90% hair free, and I&#x27;m definitely thrilled. I&#x27;ve never done any hair removal or bleaching on my upper lip, and had just relied on foundation and coverup to hide it. I have dark hair so hair removal is definitely important to me. I didn&#x27;t experience any serious burns apart from the slight burning sensation when it was time to remove. Another thing I saw a lot of reviewers complaining about was the smell, so I was prepared to gag the minute I opened the bottle. I was surprised to find out I actually LIKED the smell, it was a combination between wax and oranges. Even though the bottle says upper lip only, I tried it on the hairy part of my knuckles and was ecstatic to find out it worked there as well. I only detracted a star because it wasn&#x27;t perfect removal, but overall I&#x27;m majorly happy with Olay Facial Hair Removal!</li>
    <li> I used this product for fine facial hair along my jaw line and cheek area. It worked like a charm. No burning or irritation. I made sure to generously apply the Vaseline like balm before the removal cream and waited the full 10 minutes before removing with cotton balls. I will use again and highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Having hesitated to do anything on my own, my painstaking research was well worth it... This product is so easy to use with great results.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t&#x27; work as indicated at all. Don&#x27;t waste your money like i did.</li>
    <li> I used this product once. I followed all instructions. My upper lip, especially was red, and stinging. I had to use much water to rinse it off. The next day, my skin was still a little tender and mildly red.  MAK, PA</li>
    <li> I have religiously used another product for YEARS and no more...this Olay product is amazing...does not matter how long or short the hair on my upper lip or my chin is, it removes it all.  Left it on for 9 minutes and all hair was gone...totally.  No stragglers left to pluck out afterwards...no touch up needed with the tweezers.  I will order more and never be without it.  Some hairs were coarse but the majority were fine to medium and this product took care of all.  I cannot praise it enough and highly recommend it...and no skin irritation and my skin is very sensitive!</li>
    <li> still had some hair to remove, so I would buy a different product next time And it smelled like perm solution</li>
    <li> Works really well for removing hair</li>
    <li> I really like the product, but it will work differently in different skins.&lt;br /&gt;It took about week 1/2 to see growth again but it wasn&#x27;t really noticeable, so I re-applied about 3 weeks after from the first use..</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  My normally sensitive skin had no issues with it, and it can be used right before putting on make up.</li>
    <li> It burned off the hair, and my face too! Very red, irritated skin. Not all parts of our faces are equal. My face is BURNING and very very red. Not to mention a major ouch!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried it once and was disappointed- not all the hair was removed. I will give it another try...but I thought I had followed the instructions correctly!</li>
    <li> This product is excellent,but with some negative effects. First the cream is not painful, perfect if your sensitive to pain like me. It also comes with a skin guard, so you can protect your skin to the harsh chemicals. The negatives are that my skin broke out and had ance after a use. Also the cream as a slight chemical smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;Tip: apply the skin gaurd conservatively so the cream can be effective.</li>
    <li> pretty good alternative to threading.</li>
    <li> Sorry if the title is offensive but it is my honest opinion. Since using this product several of my black friends have told me they have broke out from olay products bad as well. I&#x27;m posting a picture of the rash I got a couple of days after using the this on my cheeks &amp; chin. My skin especially in these areas is normally very smooth. I&#x27;ve never broke out like this period. $100 later between my doctor, dermatology, antibiotics &amp; a prescribed cream I &amp;#34;may&amp;#34; start getting better. I used this 2 weeks ago &amp; my face is still itching with a slight burn. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!</li>
    <li> There are other products out there that do a much better job than this, I wouldn&#x27;t  bother purchasing this one.</li>
    <li> Not sure what I did wrong but this product burned my face and the burning sensation lasted over eight hours. Face is red and puffy.</li>
    <li> Great product. Very sensitive skin that this product takes care of. Happy to have tried this system out and the price is great!</li>
    <li> It did not work as good as I thought it would have and it left my skin feeling weird for hours.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews on this product I thought it was a great deal.  I was wrong. It removed only &amp;#34;some&amp;#34; fine hair and my skin was left very dry after using this product once.  I do not recommend Olay Smooth finish.</li>
    <li> Product worked well in a short amount of time, leaving my skin smooth and hair free. Will use it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a product like this but it was recommended by my sister. Have used it twice and it is very effective and leaves skin quite smooth. Be sure to apply ample coverage with the wax stick before applying the cream as skin can get burned if you don&#x27;t thoroughly rub in the wax protector. Very good product. Giving it 4  stars as I think it is overpriced.</li>
    <li> My 15 year old daughter and I both use this.  It works great for blond-light brown hair.  Follow the instructions and you&#x27;re good to go.  It does leave my lip area a little red for an hour or two, but I don&#x27;t use it when I&#x27;m planning to go out right away!</li>
    <li> This product felt great on. No bad smell. No burning, redness or irritation afterwards. Definitely recommend to a friend. Love!!!!</li>
    <li> I was pleased with this product compared to the previous product I had.  The first step is the best.  My skin was not irritated by the removal step and it left my skin feeling very smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> I have tried it once, and saw no effect whatsoever. I used the balm to protect my skin, so no irritation, but no change either.  The hair is fine, and fair, and the lotion had no effect that I can see.  I may give it another shot, but am not encouraged.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past two years and I only just recently ran out. It truly is the best for any kind of unwanted facial hair (upper lip/chin area). It doesn&#x27;t cause the hair to grow back faster and it never returns in a darker shade. Mine always lasts me about two weeks before the hair becomes noticeable again. The only thing I would suggest is thoroughly washing your face immediately before and immediately after use, because it has caused minor breakouts in those area on me before. Not a big deal though. 100% recommended - it&#x27;s also much cheaper here on Amazon than anywhere else!</li>
    <li> Works perfectly! Love it for myself and teenage daughter.</li>
    <li> works exactly as it says it should - no redness no swelling. Highly recommend for sensitive skin</li>
    <li> I was very careful using this product. Left in on 2-3 minutes less than it stated too &amp; I still burned my face.  Be careful &amp; dont leave it on very long the first time.</li>
    <li> I was so excited about this Olay product I was sure it was going to be the answer to my facial hair and for the price of $20 the price was a steal since it seems you can remove hair more than once, beats going to get a facial at a spa/salon and is pain free!! Before I purchased the Olay product I looked into YouTube and found that I was going to have a 50/50 chance of the cream to work on me but since I&#x27;ve tried Nair, Veet and Sally products I thought Olay will be better since you have to prep the skin before use of the hair removal to protect the skin. I thought awesome!! My face won&#x27;t get irritated. SOOOO disappointed!! I follow the instruction and had it on for 8mins and removed some off my upper lip and notice still wasn&#x27;t ready so I left it on for 10mins and removed it all, some hair was removed but most of it was still on. I gave the rating 2 stars only because of the price and the product didn&#x27;t have a bad smell but was not what I expected and will not buy it again I rather go to a Spa/Salon.</li>
    <li> Made my skin itch and turn red.</li>
    <li> I have used it for three months now I am not completely satisfied with the results. The only positive is that this product did not cause any irritation; however, it did not remove all of the hair. I started at 6 minutes he 1st time, bumped it up to 7 minutes the next, and for the last few times I have done the max of 8 minutes and it still did not remove all the hair like the box picture or other pictures I have seen. This is the 1st hair removal product that I have used and do not have course hair. I have done this multiple times and have been applying more and Moore product each time to see if that would help but it doesn&#x27;t. Wish the results were better.</li>
    <li> This arrived fast, nicely packaged and exactly what I wanted.  Even works with my sensitive skin.  I think I found my new favorite product!</li>
    <li> Used this with ease. Does a great job. I would recommend using the strongest version. My hair is not course, so I got the medium strength and it wasn&#x27;t enough. I have to leave it on longer. The smell is pretty strong too.</li>
    <li> I was extremely disappointed in this product because it didn&#x27;t remove the hair from my face.  I would never recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I used this on a Friday evening before going out, and I was thrilled with the result. The product was easy to use and worked just as advertised. My upper lip was smooth and hair free. I found myself wondering why I&#x27;d been plucking all those years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the next morning--just 18 hours later--I had stubbly regrowth. Only noticeable up close, or if I rubbed my upper lip, but definitely there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this product three stars, because it still does the job. And it&#x27;s easy enough to pluck out the stubble as it shows up. Or to keep using the product every day, I guess. But I was disappointed to realize I would have to do one of these things, and right away to boot. I was hoping the results would last a week at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, this is not the miracle product you&#x27;ve been waiting for.</li>
    <li> I have been using other cream hair removal products for years. None have been as effective and as GENTLE as this one. Today was the first time using it and it was easy, quick and thorough. I had no burning sensations like some other brands can give. No redness after. Just smooth, hairless skin. Finally! I will definitely continue to subscribe to the Olay Hair Removal Duo!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t tear my skin up and that was a miracle because I have very sensitive skin, but it was only smooth for a couple of days before I started growing stubble. I&#x27;d rather wax and rip the hair out at the roots than have stubble growth. It looked like I had tried shaving or something. Definitely not for me.</li>
    <li> Barely works half the time</li>
    <li> Still haven&#x27;t found a great product...I have to use this 2 days in a row for it to work completely.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product! It works just like they say and no negative skin reactions.  The odor is a bit strong, but is bearable.</li>
    <li> Fuzzy Stach solution solved!!! I&#x27;ll use this about once a week to two weeks. Works great. No more fuzz!</li>
    <li> did not work for me, upper lip course hair....followed instructions to the letter with high hopes.  Will have to keep up hope of other options.</li>
    <li> I gave this five stars because this product works really well as long as the directions are followed. I find that if you use a generous amount of the balm and really rub it into your skin for a full minute before application of the hair removal cream, it avoids irritation. Also, do not leave this on for more than 6 minutes or so. I have not always followed these practices carefully, and been sad with the results. It can irritate your skin, make it red, and cause burning; however, if you follow the directions, this is a great product. I have blonde hair so I&#x27;m unable to laser. This is a great alternative!</li>
    <li> Olay face here. This removes my lip hair without making my skin burn.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t remove all the hair, I got the one for &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; skin but it ended up burning 4 stops in my face. I love Olay but this product is terrible.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t wax my upper lip because I break out everytime. I&#x27;ve tried alot of hair removal products but none actually removed the hair. My hair was fully grown out when I used the product. Within a few minutes in I noticed the dark hair coming to the top. When it came time to remove the cream, I wiped it off and all the hair came off with it. My lip felt completey bare even the blonde hairs in the middle. No pain or burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed people saying it didn&#x27;t remove new hair growth, I think it would work best when the hair is more grown out just like with waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m extremely excited to not have to shave anymore I will continue to use this product!</li>
    <li> when i use the produce to control fine hair on top lip it was not, as expected. The hair grew back like a man beard would grow back, stubble to touch.!  so i preferred to use my tweezers and pluck them out when the hair grow back i get a smooth felling on the upper lip.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a product like this, and was getting desperate.  I have sensitive skin, but several coarse hairs; neither waxing or other depilatories helped, as I would get red rashes, tears where the wax pulled the skin or open sores where the depilatory ate through my skin!  Not to mention the breakouts!  Shaving was not an option, too weird...  So a 15x optical mirror and tweezers were my best friends until today.  This product works exactly as advertised, I wiped a thin layer of balm across my upper lip, massaged it in, put on the removal cream and 10 minutes later I was hair free; with soft skin, no red and several hours later I am still fine.  Thank you OLAY for making my life just a bit easier...</li>
    <li> I saw it online and wanted to try out, I didn&#x27;t really care for this product, it didn&#x27;t removed all the upper lip hair.</li>
    <li> Just exactly what I was looking for. In just a few minutes, your unwanted dark hairs are gone without plucking.</li>
    <li> I tried this product for fine upper lip facial hair removal. Now instead of fine hair, I have stubble. I tried the product 3 times within a 3 day period (even though it states not to use more than once per week) and still have stubble. On the bright side, it did not seem to irritate my skin (some minor redness where I got outside the barrier line) and the smell was not objectionable.</li>
    <li> My skin was dry afterwards.  Very dry.  I will admit I didn&#x27;t rub the pre treatment in as suggested this might be the cause.  It took me over 2 weeks of deep lotion treatments to get my skin not dry.  I am afraid to try again.</li>
    <li> Olay is quick and easy to use and sufficiently effective. I have no problem using this a couple of times a week to avoid waxing which irritates my sensitive skin so badly that I have to plan for 5-6 days of red, swollen patches afterward. Thank you,  Olay.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product!  It does a gentle, complete job of removing facial hair and the longer I use it, the finer the hair and less of it!  Thank you for a great product that does what it is meant to do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pleased with the results of Olay Smooth Finish Facial Hair Removal Duo.  It is very easy to use and my facial hair was greatly reduced in one application.  Since I&#x27;ve only used it once I&#x27;m anxious to see how long the results will last and how often I will need to use it to maintain my results.</li>
    <li> I bought this at this store and I totally regret it! It&#x27;s a waste. I read the positive comments and was wondering if it was the actual employees that left them. This stuff is useless. Save your time and your money!</li>
    <li> Works great on my face and doesn&#x27;t give me a rash. I have uber sensitive skin, so this works really well, as long as you follow all the instructions to the dot.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t even know where to begin.  I am 59 and have had facial hair issues since I was in my late 20&#x27;s.  When I talked to my family doctor about it, he said I was too young for hormones so I should just shave it off.  I had tried Nair and it just turned my face into a broken out blotch.  I finally resorted to shaving the few. HUGE MISTAKE! Once you shave a few, you of course end up getting other hairs around those few and then 30 years later you end up like me with more hair than some men! I tried waxing, but my skin is very sensitive and it left my upper lip with blisters and redness that lasted two weeks.  I then spent a small fortune buying the useless piece of junk known as NO-NO hair remover.  Ladies, the $300+ money spent on that is the same as laying $300 in front of you and lighting in on fire. In the past couple of years I have just resorted to shaving my upper lip and chin.  A couple of years ago my mom was in an out of state hospital.  My sister and brother and I went with her and the 3 of us shared a hotel room. One morning while getting ready to go to the hospital, my sis was already dressed, my brother had an ironing board set up, and I was in the bathroom with the door open while I shaved and put my make-up on.  My brother and I were chatting away when all of a sudden he shouted, \\&quot;Holy Crap, you are shaving!!\\&quot;.  That has been my life and since passing the age of 50 and having gone through menopause, the hair growth has become MUCH WORSE. I came across the Olay Facial Hair Remover for Fine to Medium Hair. Having always used and loved Oil of Olay products, I thought what the heck.  Though my facial hair on upper lip and chin is mostly coarse from having shaved so many years, it was the only type (fine to medium)available.  I followed the directions and left it on a full 10 minutes.  OH MY GOODNESS WAS I EVER SHOCKED AND SUPER PLEASED WITH THE RESULTS! So much so that I had to get out my big magnified mirror to see if what I thought I was seeing was in fact real.  E-V-E-R-Y single fine hair on both my upper lip and chin were completely gone!  About 90% of the dark black coarse hairs were also gone! Absolutely no burning or redness or irritation of any kind during or after. I was so happy and excited that I had to go wake my husband up and make him look to verify it was gone. He wasn&#x27;t happy about being woke up, but he was amazed I had finally found a product that works! If this product works for me, it should work for anyone.  I say that because I seriously, honestly, had more hair on my chin than most guys I know.  It was so bad that I made my best friend and my hair stylist promise me that if I was ever in a hospital and was incapacitated that they would come and bring an electric razor and shave me.  I would shave first thing of the morning, and had stubbles and \\&quot;5 o&#x27;clock shadow\\&quot; by early evening. THANK YOU OIL OF OLAY FOR THIS AMAZING GOD SEND OF A PRODUCT!act real.

    <li> This stuff really works and was so easy and fast. Better than bleaching cream. Will use it from now on.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream for over a year and it truly works! I have dark hair and was always self-conscious about the hair above my lip. I apply quite a generous amount to make sure I get it all and it doesn&#x27;t sting or cause any kind of reaction on my skin. I can usually go about a month in between applications, although I usually wait until right before a special occasion. I got about 8-10 uses out of the first tube.</li>
    <li> This is the best facial hair removal I have ever come cross and so simple to use.I don&#x27;t have a lot of facial hair but being dark hired always get a few on the upper lip and this removes them so quickly.No irritation just put the balm on first then the cream,wait 10 or so mins and you can see the hair just lift.Pretty amazing stuff and the best.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It is gentle on my skin and I have no problems with it.  I also share it with my mother and she likes it.</li>
    <li> I would not use it again.  Even carefully following the instructions for putting the protective cream on, it still burned my face.</li>
    <li> i am absolutely thrilled with this product.  i am old school and usually use nair on my upper lip and chin.  while it removes the hair, i often end up with small burns that scab over - not cute.  i decided to try this product because i liked the protective 2-step application.  before any hair remover goes on your face, you apply a special balm (in stick form - you just smooth it over the middle of the area to be treated) and gently rub it in.  once the balm is on, the remover lotion is applied and is left on for no longer than 10 minutes.  not only did the product remove all the hair i wanted it to remove, it did not cause me a moment of discomfort;  no scabs, no redness or irritation.  excellent product.</li>
    <li> This product was not all it has been made out to be. When used it took a while before the hair was removed. And , the hair grew back over a day or so . Not a very effective product</li>
    <li> This application took longer than the 8 minutes required to remove facial hair. I&#x27;m wondering what the point of this is, it comes with a protector (in a wand application,  and the hair remover smells a lot like NAIR and other body hair removal products. The hair stayed away the same length of time, but what your basically getting is NAIR and a little wand of petroleum jelly in a box. Not impressed, especially, not for the price.</li>
    <li> I used this on my facial hair and followed all the directions.  I actually got irritated by the chemicals in this product.  I have used other products like Nair and never had a breakout or a reaction, but this stuff was bad for my skin. Even so, I didn&#x27;t rate this 3 stars because of that.  It did not remove all the hair after the complete time I had it on.  It only took away some of it, leaving me with hair in places and not in others.  If I would have reapplied this, I probably would have burned my skin more.  The smell of this was horrible, but thats to be expected.  I think this product would work best for those with thin lip hair or even hair throughout and people with tolerant skin.</li>
    <li> I tried Olay Smooth Finish on my face in an area with fine to medium hair. I don&#x27;t really care about removing peach fuzz or fine hair, as that&#x27;s the least of my problems (I have pale skin and dark coarse hair so it&#x27;s a lifelong battle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the protective moisture stick -- it has a consistency similar to a lip balm or an everlasting lip color gloss -- and it went on smoothly without any odor or fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dispensed a small bead of the depilatory and applied it to a small spot on my face. It started out without alot of odor, but soon I could smell the typical chemical odor of hair remover. I left it on the required time and wiped it off with a tissue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results were good on the fine hair but the medium hair was still there (maybe medium hair on me is like coarse on someone else). I did not have a rash or reaction, which is good. However, for my needs this product isn&#x27;t a good fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think for someone with sensitive skin who despises long fine hair (peach fuzz) and who has a few medium hairs on their face -- this product will work well. It&#x27;s not practical for me for the cost and results.</li>
    <li> I usually use the avon hair removal product which works ok, but this didn&#x27;t seem to work at all and I left it on for a longer period of time than recommended.Will not be buying again.</li>
    <li> This item had so much potential.  I&#x27;ve had problem hairs around my lip and chin for years.  I got tired of always using a razor and getting razor bumps.  I turned to Olay which is a respectable company with a good reputation.  After trying to find this product at CVS and Target and not having any luck, I ordered through Amazon.  I used to product exactly as described.  It did not get rid of my hair.  Maybe 5-10% but nothing more.  It did not burn and my skin is smooth, but that is not the reason to buy the product.  It does not live up to its hype.</li>
    <li> I have never written a review for anything but after using this product I had to write about it. I am always looking for a new facial hair remover because I am always left with a red upper lip and burning sensation after using them.  I have used surgi cream and nair and was curious to try Olay&#x27;s version.  I was amazed when I finished that my hair was gone and my upper lip was not red.  No burning sensation, just smooth skin!  I have only used this product once but will definitely continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Not that I want to tell you about my facial har, but the older I get, plus my Italian heritage makes hair removal products mandatory for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate waxing, plucking, and hate the smell of most hair removal products.  They smell like rotten eggs.  Plus, I&#x27;ve had some burn my skin, which isn&#x27;t fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive skin, you should use this product.  The balm that comes with the cream is meant to keep your skin protected.  Plus after the process, makes your skin nice and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream was very effective in removing the hair too.  And it was a little less smelly than other hair removal creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend this product.  I think it&#x27;s worth the price, especially for women with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with Olay&#x27;s Smooth Finish Facial Hair Removal Duo. This kit is incredibly easy to use. You just take step 1 (which is a stick and looks like lip balm) and swipe it once in the middle of the area you are removing the hair. Then, you massage it into your skin for 20 seconds while making sure you cover then entire are you are treating. For step 2 you use the cream and apply it thickly with your finger. Then you wait for 8-10 minutes and wipe off with a tissue/ cotton ball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions and left the cream on for about 9 minutes. It removed all my upper hair lip except for one hair (this was remedied the second time I used the product by leaving it on just over 10 minutes). I have pretty thick and coarse hair and it worked great for me. I did feel a slight burning at around 7 minutes, but once I wiped the product off there was no burning or redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think that this product is a little too expensive, but most depilatory creams are. I only had to use a small amount of the cream, so it seems that this kit will last me for about 4-5 months, which is pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend trying this kit and seeing how it works for you.</li>
    <li> Was not that impressed on results</li>
    <li> If I had reviewed this product within 6 days of my first use, I would have given it 5 stars. However, at day 7 and on, my skin has broken out and gotten blotchy and red. Since the hair has started growing back, it looks like I have rosacea on my upper lip--something I&#x27;ve never had before. I followed all the directions exactly so I don&#x27;t know what went wrong. I will not be using this product again and am bummed I wasted the money on it.</li>
    <li> WORKS, BUT, YOU HAVE TO PUT ON THIS CREAM 48 HOURS BEFORE USING THE HAIR REMOVAL CREAM. SO YOU CAN&#x27;T JUST SPONTANEOUSLY USE IT. MAKE SURE THE HAIR YOU&#x27;RE REMOVING IS LONG ENOUGH, IT WON&#x27;T WORK ON SHORT STUBBLE. IT REMOVED THE HAIR EFFECTIVELY, BUT THE RESULTS DON&#x27;T LAST LONG. HAIR STARTED GROWING BACK WITHIN 24 HRS.</li>
    <li> I must say, the facial fuzz came off fairly well, for the most part.&lt;br /&gt;After that, however, things did not go so well for my face.  Massive dryness ensued, after which I was plagued by a breakout the likes of which have not been seen for years.  This may not be a common reaction, but it happened to me, and my skin is not even particularly sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just bummed I can&#x27;t find the receipt.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several times without the prep balm and it was totally fine. Not even any redness.  I have normal skin with not a lot of sensitivity.  Results with the balm is not nearly as good.</li>
    <li> This product worked great for me.  I used to wax...a messy, lengthy ordeal.  With this, I&#x27;m done in about 10 minutes...no cleanup or equipment storage issues.  I have pretty sensitive skin, and haven&#x27;t had any problems with it.  I just follow the instructions and leave it on for 8 minutes.  Afterwards, my skin feels so soft and smooth. Now if I could just find an equally effective product to remove wrinkles! Ha!</li>
    <li> The first time, it worked flawlessly. There was a little burning, but it was manageable. The second time, I used a bit too much balm and had almost no hair removal. BUT I eventually got the hang of application with just the right amount of coverage from the balm so there was no burning, but not too much that the hair removal wouldn&#x27;t work. This product works, and it last almost two weeks (could depend on the type of hair and the area). Works great and I like it.</li>
    <li> This did better than my old grocery store had, a bit more money wise but a better job,</li>
    <li> I am sure the directions have missed the final step and that is; after removing with tissue, pick up your tweezers and pull out hairs. It might be me but the product does not seem to remove fine chin hairs at all.</li>
    <li> Age: 57&lt;br /&gt;skin type: sensitive with slight rosacea&lt;br /&gt;fine hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes in two tubes: 1 soft tube that contains the hair remover; 1 hard tube that contains the \\&quot;waxy\\&quot; skin protector.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friend laughs at me because I like to eradicate just about every hair from my body that isn&#x27;t on my brows or head. Yeah. So any peachy fuzz or any other kind of hair that shows up on my face is going to be blasted, waxed, plucked, or somehow otherwise taken care of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First apply the \\&quot;waxy\\&quot; skin protector in a light coat, then rub it into the skin: do not skip this step! Don&#x27;t just apply the skin protector without rubbing it in either. It does make a difference. Then apply a layer of the hair removal over the skin protector. I usually wait the entire recommended 7-8 minutes. Wipe with a soft cloth (I usually do wet a cloth and wipe not only in opposite direction of hair, but in direction of hair). I then moisturize my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though if you have any course black hair, it may not remove it completely; however, I have found that it effectively removes fine \\&quot;peach fuzzy\\&quot; hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four stars because I believe this product is pricey for the amount one gets--it&#x27;s not much product, folks. And as well because it doesn&#x27;t always remove every hair--and for the price, it should. That said, if I use it as directed, my face is not irritated or sting-y, and it leaves my skin soft and hair free.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well. Had to re-do the first time I used it.  I just didn&#x27;t use it correctly.  Works fine.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. I read the other reviews and made sure to put the protector on everywhere I needed to remove hair. No irritation and all the hair gone. Love it.</li>
    <li> Not loving this, followed the directions and have left on up to 10 minutes and still doesn&#x27;t remove all hair, and my hair is fine blond hair, so not sure how this is reviewed so well.  Won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> A slight irritation if the gel is not positioned correctly. Otherwise, better than most others I have used.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised at the results. This product has removed virtually all of the fine hairs on my upper lip and it has significantly reduced some coarser hairs in the lip area. I have followed the instructions from the package and have found that it also helps to apply the depilatory against the hair growth, sort of lifting the hairs while applying. This seems to allow the product to penetrate the follicle more efficiently, resulting in a smoother finish. I use it weekly and am very happy wth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 52 and purchased this product and so glad I did. I have fine hair on neck, chin, and upper lip. My skin is fair and I have green eyes, so I was a little scared to try it. I used it EXACTLY how it said on box and had NO problems. Yes the smell is a little strong but so worth it not to be embarrassed by hair on my face!! I will continue using this product as needed! Please keep it on the market!!!</li>
    <li> I have thick hair growing on my face and this product has hard time getting rid of it. It burns the skin around even with the protective balm. I left the product for 11 min last time and still had hair around my upper lip. No all of it but there was some</li>
    <li> I read a lot of the reviews about this product on Amazon and the Olay website.  Most of the unhappy people seemed to have coarse hair to be removed, and they said the product did not work.  I am a fair 49yr old (tomorrow) redhead who has (had) very fine hair on my face/chin/ears.  I used the hair remover today, and my face/chin/ear lobes are nice and smooth!  I was methodical...used a timer and applied the product in sections.  I left it on for 7 minutes on each section. I do feel a little bit of irritation in different areas, but no redness. I am curious to see how often I need to use the hair remover. A very pleased customer!</li>
    <li> I got this Olay Smooth Finish Facial Hair Removal Kit for my wife to try, so I am basing this review on her experience with this product.  This was her first time using any sort of hair removal product, so we didn&amp;iexcl;¦t really know what to expect.  Thankfully, the instructions were very clear, and the entire process is very straight forward.  The product even smells very nice, which is a big plus, since it is applied so close to the nose.  º&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife has the typical, extremely fine &amp;iexcl;¥peach fuzz&amp;iexcl;¦ type hairs on her chin and along the far edges of her cheeks.  You have to really look hard to see it.  However, she does have two or three darker, thicker hairs that sprout from her neck, which she plucks with a tweezers ever couple of weeks.  At the time she applied the Olay Smooth Finish product, she has two of those darker hairs visible, although barely.  She left the product on a little longer than the instructions suggested, because she really wanted to see perfect results.  What she did see, after removal, was somewhat disappointing.  First of all, she could immediate see that the darker hairs were still on her neck.  However, she did notice that most of the fuzz-like hairs were gone.  She then noticed some slight reddening of her skin, especially above and around her lips.  Those slightly red areas got worse, over the next half hour to an hour.  She said the skin felt a bit warm and sensitive, but wasn&amp;iexcl;¦t really uncomfortable enough to cause concern.  The red splotches went away completely within a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall my wife said that she will keep this Olay product in mind, if and when she decides to try a facial hair removal product again.  She is still quite young, so her needs for this kind of product may increase in the years to come.  It disappointed her that the darker hairs were not removed by this product.  Those darker hairs, while coarser than the light fuzz on her cheeks, are not very thick.  She is also somewhat worried about the red splotches she experienced when using this product.  I&amp;iexcl;¦m sure she would definitely not use it on a day that she knew she would have to go out in public, within a few hours after use.  She is not aware of having any allergies, but when dealing with a mixture of chemicals that are applied to an area as sensitive as one&amp;iexcl;¦s face it is possible that she had some kind of reaction that wouldn&amp;iexcl;¦t be normal for the average consumer.  It was our combined decision that this should be considered a 3-star product.  If it were not so expensive, we could have agreed to add a star, but at the current cost, it should do a little better job of removing the more stubborn facial hairs.  So for now she is going to stick with her trusty pair of tweezers, and her [[ASIN:B0009DT39C Panasonic ES2113PC Pivoting Head Facial Trimmer, Pink]].  She loves that little Panasonic trimmer, and highly recommends it to all women looking for a gentle, effective way of getting rid of that blond &amp;iexcl;¥peach-fuzz&amp;iexcl;¦ hair on the face.  Many thanks to Olay, and to Amazon Vine, for allowing us to try this product.the red splotches she experienced when using this product.

    <li> This product did not work for me. I have fine, thin hairs on my upper lip, which is the only place I use it/need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried leaving the product on for the suggested time, for longer than the suggested time, and even without the base coat. I have tried putting on extra cream (thinking: maybe it would work better if I laid it on super-thick?) Not once did a single hair come off my face, and I tried it at least 10 times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend. Very disappointing, as I love Olay for their other products, but this one was a waste of my money.</li>
    <li> I recently started Accutane to treat my acne and had a horrible experience trying to wax the hair off my upper lip (took the skin off!), so in my searches for a gentile hair remover for sensitive skin, I came across this product.  I was a little hesitant to try it because of the price, but so glad I did.  Even with ultra sensitive skin at this point, I didn&#x27;t feel any burning or tingling nor was I left with redness or ANY irritation whatsoever.  I had no problem removing all the hairs.  I am so relieved that I am not forced to tweeze my lip area (ouch!) during the course of treatment.  I think this product is worth every penny.  I will throw in a disclaimer though, since I did have such a horrible experience with waxing, which I used to do routinely, I did test a small patch of skin before attempting the whole area just in case of irritation.  If you are having any kind of skin treatments done, I would advise you to do the same.  I thought I could get away with waxing after a week of being on Accutane, wrong!  Just play it safe, having a red stache for a week is way more embarrassing than a little facial hair.</li>
    <li> I had tried a few other hair removal methods in the past for the hair on my upper lip. Tweezing and waxing were the only things that worked. I had never tried a depilatory cream except for once on my legs (which was a HORRIBLE experience with zero results) and the hair on my legs is extremely coarse being as I&#x27;m a European brunette (eek!). SO I was a bit skeptical of whether or not this would work. Luckily for me, I had regularly waxed my upper lip every few weeks for a few years in my teens, so the hairs had decreased dramatically in number and had gotten pretty fine. I&#x27;ve stopped waxing for the past few years, since it was a hassle and always left enough irritation that it was inconvenient. There were only a few hairs on the outer corners that you could see, and the rest were almost invisible. Lately they have been bothering me a bit, and this product was reasonably-priced, so I decided to go for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The process was extremely simple. Apply the balm, rub it around for about 10 seconds to make sure it absorbs into the skin and doesn&#x27;t coat the hairs too much, then apply a THICK layer of the cream, and let it sit. After ten minutes, give the cream a firm wipe with a round cotton pad or cotton ball. I like to splash the area with water and apply moisturizer right away to soothe my sensitive skin (this step may not be necessary for everyone, I just did it to be extra sure since in the past I&#x27;ve had issues with dry skin after hair removal methods). It worked perfectly for me the first time, except that a few of the hairs on the outer corner of my upper lip were still there. I must not have applied the product thickly enough the first time. However I just tried again the next day and they were ALMOST gone, except for maybe one or two stragglers. These I just tweezed. I also tried this product on the space between my brows as I had a few stray fine hairs there as well, and it worked perfectly there, removing 100% of the little hairs I wanted gone. I have somewhat sensitive skin and this product didn&#x27;t seem to aggravate my skin. There was a slight odour but this is almost unavoidable with a hair removal cream. It wasn&#x27;t unpleasant, or too strong at all especially considering it was right under my nose. Also there seems to be more than enough of the cream in the tube for at least 4-6 uses (for me that means in multiple areas at one time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My upper lip was smooth and hair-free for at least two weeks after my first use. I didn&#x27;t notice any hair until 3 weeks later, and it has now been one month since my first use. I&#x27;ve just used it a second time and everything was completely removed. The key for effective hair removal is applying a layer that&#x27;s VERY thick, thick enough that you can&#x27;t see through it at all, the skin and hair must be completely concealed under the cream. Clearly Olay has worked some kind of magic with this system; it&#x27;s gentle yet effective.

    <li> I never review things I buy but I must say this is the best thing that&#x27;s hit the shelves in awhile! I tried it on myself and my daughter to test it. I have blonde hair on my lip and she has black hair. I left it on for 8 minutes and it removed all the hair from the top of my lip. We left hers on the same amount of time and there were a few hairs that stayed. I&#x27;m not sure why but I&#x27;m still very happy with this stuff! I guess if you have darker hair, you should leave it on a full ten minutes!</li>
    <li> I bought this item and thought it would work.  I tried it several times and it didn&#x27;t work for me.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is a lot less painful than wax.</li>
    <li> I bought this exact product based on the good amazon reviews. I have very fine hair that is impossible to pluck and waxing hasnt been too productive for me. I used this last week for the first time. It was really easy to use. I was worried about it burning my skin like some other hair removal creams have done to me, but with the step one my skin did not feel burned. It was red for a little while after use and my skin felt weird - I think it was the fact that it was hair free. It has been a week and I have not seen any hair coming back yet. I used it on my chin, cheeks, nose and jawline. I did the full 8min, but really I think I could have been fine with 6 min.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy mine from Amazon but I wanted to leave a review here as well because I love Amazon and it&#x27;s reviewers! I have tried a couple facial hair removal products and this is the best one I&#x27;ve found. The two part system is what protects your skin and it worked well on my sensitive, acne prone skin. I used it on my problem areas of my face including my cheeks because my hair is dark and I want my makeup to go on smoother. I experienced slight redness after removal. I have fine hair and I left the cream on for 8 minutes. It definitely exfoliates the top layer of the skin and I believe that&#x27;s why there was some slight redness at first. After removal I washed my face with my cerave cleanser then applied a bit of tend skin followed by pure aloe Vera gel. This is the second time I&#x27;ve used this product and I think I&#x27;ve worked out the kinks! So far, so good!</li>
    <li> not for sensitive skin. I felt hurt when I was using this, so returned it.</li>
    <li> I typically have problems with facial products because my skin is so sensitive. I am so pleased that it is kind to my skin and it really works!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t remove the hair despite leaving it on longer than recommended and repeating the process 3 days later, as recommended.</li>
    <li> I was pleased with the removal of the peach fuzz on my cheeks, chin, and upper neck area. There were some spots that still had fuzz after using it but I think that was due to me not putting enough of the removal cream, or missing some spots altogether.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One word of caution, though: This morning I did pluck right below my chin and I must&#x27;ve broken the skin. When I used the hair removal there was INTENSE burning in that area. That was the only spot that became irritated...the rest was no problem at all. Make sure you don&#x27;t have any broken skin before using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I am very pleased with the results! Will use it again to get the spots I missed : )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Oil of Olay!</li>
    <li> Very, very disappointed. I used 3 times and was not effective for my fine facial hair.  Would not recommend. I really expected more from Olay.  On the plus side, I did not experience any irritation.  However, did not experience much hair gone either.</li>
    <li> I am amazed at the mixed reviews on this product, which is why I was hesitant to try it out. I wish I would have tried it sooner as it worked 100% for me and that&#x27;s why I am leaving this review.  I have very sensitive skin and have struggled for YEARS trying to find a product that worked and did not leave me red and irritated after. I have fine to medium hair, which is who this product is aimed at. I used this product as instructed, left the cream on for 6 minutes, and wiped it off. I kept waiting for my skin to redden or feel irritated but neither happened! And not a hair left on my upper lip! I am so happy that it is well worth the cost, and I will be using this and recommending it to friends who have also struggled for a product that works and is friendly to your face. Thanks Olay!!</li>
    <li> NOOOO!!!! don&#x27;t do it!! don&#x27;t do it!!! Not worth it!! Skin looks great for a day or 2 then BAM!!! rash city, totally irritated skin, wish I&#x27;d never gotten the stuff! One application, rest in the trash....</li>
    <li> John&#x27;s wife is not impressed.  Just dealing with average hair removal. Back to waxing.</li>
    <li> I was kind of worried before buying this. I read a lot of reviews, and took me a couple of days to decide if I should try it or if it would be a waste of money. I got one today, and tried it immediately. It was amazing!! No smell, no irritation, or no burn. It is very convenient to use, and it leaves my skin smooth and clear. I love this product. It&#x27;s more expensive than other choices. But think about it. It&#x27;s for your facial skin which is very sensitive, and cannot be hidden if something wrong after using product. So, i think it&#x27;s worth it. I use other Olay products too,and that makes me confident when I tried this one. They always have good quality products.~~</li>
    <li> I had to try this twice to get results. The 2nd time, I left the solution on longer and it dissolved some of the hair. This was over a month ago and my skin is still peeling and dry in the area of use. I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product works, the growth took about the same amount of time to grow back.  Best part no pain, everytime you have to wax you drag the process out, no you don&#x27;t have to worry it doesn&#x27;t hurt, yeah!!!</li>
    <li> This product is a big disappointment - it did not remove any of the fine hair, let alone the few coarser ones that most women have.  Two thumbs down.</li>
    <li> I purchased an expensive, precription , $90.00 creme, I have developed course hair after I went to the change of life.&lt;br /&gt;I did try this and the olay product,  same thing, the course hair, never comes off, unless you use a razor or Nair. Even Nair does not do a good Job. The Makeup artist, Bobby Brown, said , Just have lasic treatment, its the only way, to get rid of it.&lt;br /&gt;They also have a product called \\&quot;no, No\\&quot;. Does anyone have experiance with that.? Thanks Randi</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used anything before but my mustache became too much for me to stomach!  The product was definitely easy and convenient to use.  After first use I felt like there were still little pokey hairs like a bad shave.  Having just used it for the second time I feel like the skin is smoother but not perfect.  There are plenty of uses for the money - so the price was definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> I have very fine blonde upper lip hair and this product doesn&#x27;t even work on it.  It only removes a few hairs and I still have to get my lip waxed or threaded.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It makes removing any facial hairs so easy!</li>
    <li> It does the job but it isnt the best product out there in terms of hair removal products.</li>
    <li> I was pretty happy with this product for the first three times I used it. I followed the instructions, did all the previous testing recommended, and waited the exact time before removal. On the fourth time it literally burned my face. See the picture here: h[...]&lt;br /&gt;This is my second day with these burns. I am extremely disappointed and want to warn everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not use this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Discontinue its use before it burns your face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is worse, I do not know how to cure it. I am using a Hydrocortisone cream with aloe and it has calmed the burning sensation. But the redness is still there.</li>
    <li> My Mexican heritage makes my upper lip a job too robust for tweezers. And I&#x27;m a WIMP about waxing. So this product is pretty much the best thing ever. You get the smooth effect of a wax job with none of the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a genius product. The lotion creates a thin layer protecting the skin from the hair-removing chemicals. There is virtually no discomfort. Way to go, Olay!</li>
    <li> I was tired of breaking out from waxing and tried this on a whim. It works great and does not irritate my skin. Takes 6-8 minutes, painless, not particularly smelly. I highly recommend it &amp; will keep using it.</li>
    <li> Do NOT bother buying this product. It does not even begin to work. I tried it a couple of times and it does not remove the hair. I don&#x27;t have the money to spend on something worthless as this product. The cheaper brands work much better!</li>
    <li> I think I will like this but haven&#x27;t used it yet.  I like all Olay products. If it works I&#x27;ll order again.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for several months, hoping the fine hairs on the upper lip.  Itakes care of the hair, but leaves a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow very prominent.  Will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product; it&#x27;s thorough, yet very gentle on the skin.  The smell is a whole lot easier to take in than most other brands, which boosts this to the top of my list.  :)</li>
    <li> The skin balm really helps.  I&#x27;ve tried other products in the past, but the burning sensation and the soon after slight rash was not appealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this out, but didn&#x27;t expect much.  To my surprise, the skin balm really helps with the burning sensation.  So far no rash either.  There is a very slight burn around the edges where I didn&#x27;t put the balm (note: put the balm in a wide area around where you are going to use the cream, so you cover all the edges.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am someone with very very sensitive skin.  I even have a reaction to Vaseline after about 10 minutes, and this 6 min procedure doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> So great.  Gets rid of my lady trash stash and doesn&#x27;t leave ugly redness.</li>
    <li> The first two to three days were fine but after the third day I started to see bumps on my face.I think the product is good for someone that don&#x27;t have sensitive skin like me.I just have to keep trying to find a product that works for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> To be fair, this is my FIRST time using any type of product like this...so I really don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the system isn&#x27;t \\&quot;fool proof\\&quot;. You first have to apply a moisturizer to prepare your skin. This stick can easily be over or under used. If you use to much, it will interfere with the chemicals in the second step. I would prefer a product at this cost to be a one step, seems like it would leave no room for error.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I used it once...and I had to apply a second time because I didn&#x27;t use enough in step 2. So unless you&#x27;ve used this product before...there&#x27;s a learning curve. My skin does feel smooth...but I LITERALLY just did it..so I&#x27;m not sure if there will be any side effects. (please note: the packaging indicates its best to do a test spot 48 hours in advance before using this product on your face..which I did)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m pretty satisfied, but there seems to be room for improvement. I want to stress again though, this is my first experience with a product like this, so I&#x27;m not sure how this compares to other products.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical about yet another hair removal product, but since this is from Olay I was expecting it to be a better and safer product for my skin.  Overall I am satisfied with this product.  It is a quick and easy 2 step process.&lt;br /&gt;Step one : apply the balm to the area you plan to remove hair from and them massage it into the skin &amp; surrounding area for about 20 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;Step two : apply the removal cream to the area, and wait.  I waited the full 8 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Removing this was pretty simple, and the skin left behind was not red or irritated.  It missed a few stray coarse hairs, but did remove the majority.&lt;br /&gt;The smell was pleasant enough, with no overwhelming fumes left lingering in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;There is plenty of product left for many more repeat applications.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am pleased with this new product from Olay.</li>
    <li> I was hoping that I could rave about this product because I adore anything Olay.  However, in this instance, I can&#x27;t.  The Olay Smooth Finish Facial Hair Removal Duo does not work.  I have tried it three different times in three different stages of hair growth and each time nothing was removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip this product.  It does not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natalie S. for Amazon Vine</li>
    <li> UPDATE: The next morning...Most of the red irritation subsided, but some remains. Not painful, and not so bad I couldn&#x27;t leave the house. Nevertheless, be careful and use enough balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product did exactly what it promised - and did it in 7 minutes. But know that they are SERIOUS about using the balm. I missed a couple of tiny spots on the edge of the area being treated and it turned bright red. I just completed the treatment about 10 minutes ago, and I can only hope that the burning redness goes away before morning. I was hoping to give this 5 stars, and I could because it works very well. But the red rash is definitely a point of concern.</li>
    <li> I am really pleased with this product.  It works as promised.  No skin irritation.  Leaves the skin very soft and removes the hair.  Doesn&#x27;t smell bad.  Great idea to use the balm around the area.  It was so simple and easy, I look forward to continuing to use it.  I highly recommend it and am usually skeptical of things with lots of promises - this one really delivers.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been two weeks now and my skin if finally back to normal.  I followed the directions and did the skin test.  So far so good.  So then i proceeded on.  I only used it in on a the typical target spots (upper lip and sides of face).  For some reason an allergic reaction went haywire all over my face.  The first day my cheeks were a little red.  Keep in mind I did not apply this product to my cheeks.  The next day, my face began to swell forcing my bottom eyelids to close my eyes.  The third day, my entire face blistered.  My face was so horrendous that I couldn&#x27;t go outside without scaring little kids.  Fortunately my friend is in the medical field.  He brought over day and night time allergy meds.  A week of OTC allergy pills and my inflamed, swollen, blistery face subsided.  BUT this left me with a very leathery face.  Thankfully, I am a BeautiControl consultant.  A couple days of a mild chem peel and microderm abrasion removed the layer of leathery dead skin.  I&#x27;m back to normal.  This Oil of Olay Hair Removal product is in the trash!</li>
    <li> The facial balm did not last as long as the cream. I now have cream left I can&#x27;t use because the stick balm did not last. For the price, it is not worth it.</li>
    <li> I give this product a 1 star.  I love all of the olay products and believed this one would be no different.  I used this product for the first time today and was extremely disappointed.  After following the directions exactly and leaving the product on for exactly 10 minutes I noticed that NOT one hair was removed.  All of the hair was there and the only difference is that my skin smelled horrible.  I guess I will continue to wax and tweeze until the next new thing arrives making promises of smooth hairless skin.</li>
    <li> I read about this product in a magazine and couldn&#x27;t find it in stores so decided to buy it here. It&#x27;s great! I use it on the lip and chin and it works great. Wax usually leaves my skin irritated and red for a few hours and this product doesn&#x27;t do it at all - 10 minutes, wash, wipe and you&#x27;re done. As always, I double-check and there is usually one or two hairs that&#x27;s missed, but it&#x27;s no match for the money saved and the convenience.</li>
    <li> I saw the commercials for this and thought it was a great alternative to the irritating products I was already using on my face. I have very fair skin and my hair grows out thin and light but it&#x27;s still there. I&#x27;ve tried this product 3 times without any evidence that it was working. I even used it for twice as long as was suggested and then I tried it an additional 2 times without the protective cream first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I&#x27;m sure some people would have good results, this was just not strong enough for my fine/light facial hair. Will not be buying this again.</li>
    <li> This product is worthless; it didn&#x27;t remove one hair.  I followed the instructions that come in the box and the only thing I lost was 15 minutes and $20.  Thanks Oil of Olay.</li>
    <li> This does not work!  It removes some not all hair so i&#x27;m left with patchy hair on my face.  I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> This product worked great for me and I found it to be quick and easy to use.  I had an abundance of fine blond facial hair due to medication that I take.  I am so glad I decided to try this product.  It worked exactly as it was supposed to and I had no negative reactions at all.  It was so nice to apply my makeup on smooth skin.  Looks soooo much better!  I just used it 3 days ago so not sure about regrowth, and as I stated, my facial hair was blond and fine, but a lot of it.  Will purchase this product again!</li>
    <li> Did not work, tried several times a couple of weeks apart.  Left on from 8 minutes to 11 minutes.  Could not recommend this product to anyone.  Did not even remove very fine hair.</li>
    <li> Finally. A product that produces results. Enough said.</li>
    <li> This Facial Hair Removal definitely did a great job! I used to apply wax strip but it hurts. Then I turned to some hair removal products. Those products had strong odor which will do harm to my health. Now I find this one and I love it. It does not have strong odor but it removes the fine hair efficiently. What&#x27;s more important, the effect can last for almost 1 to 2 months.</li>
    <li> Tried this product to remove some unsightly hair inbetween waxes. It&#x27;s ok,but probably shoud get stronger one. Had to leave this one on a little longer that what the directions called for.... but it might work for someone else.</li>
    <li> Does the job and usually doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, unlike wax which always causes a rash.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this product because I have a lot of facial hair and I don&#x27;t like it at all and this product is like 95% effective yes it removes hair the most painless way and very simple but not all the hair will come off. I think it depends on your skin type and other factors that play a role in the success of this product. Great Purchase it&#x27;s way more expensive at retail stores such as: Target, Walmart etc. so I definitely recommend buying it online</li>
    <li> It seems working for my case</li>
    <li> Exceeded expectation. Results lasted about week to 2 weeks depending on area. Suggested this to others as well. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> excellent product! easy to use and smell good. Olay is one of my favorite brand! This product is very awesome!</li>
    <li> Earlier I tried Epistick.,it is too pain to me., just used twice and later not even touched..tried this olay..it worked like a charm..will recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!! I had light brown and blond upper lip hair that I tried to have laser removed but they wouldn&#x27;t do it because my hair wasnt dark enough. So she told me to try this product. Ive always used oil of olay my whole life and so does my mom, and I tried this product and it took off ALL the upper lip hair in 8 min with ZERO redness or irritation. First you apply a clear Vaseline texture cream to protect your skin then you add the cream for 6 to 8 min and then it wipes right off with no redness. Buy this you will be very happy. I have very fair sensitive skin and I highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;~Nicole Hollywood FL</li>
    <li> this product removes hair just fine, and is mostly painless, but the hair grows back quickly and evenly. waxing lasts longer.</li>
    <li> It worked as advertized and I have told others about it.  I am happy with this purchase.  That is all!</li>
    <li> I used this for the first time last night.  It&#x27;s wonderful.  Removed all of my hair with hardly any side effects.  Only thing I would say, is to leave it on for the minimum amount of time, six minutes.  Any longer is not necessary.</li>
    <li> product works ok no more plucking or shaving,very little smell to it which is  good if you are sensitive to chemical smells</li>
    <li> I started using this product about a year ago.  I have sensitive skin, tweezing, epilady and anything that pulled the hair out just inflamed the area for days.  This product works great on my sensitive skin.  8 minutes and hair is gone. No redness or irritation.  I can tell when it is done when I start to feel a little stinging.</li>
    <li> My husband and I are avid amazon shoppers! However; I have to admit we do not ever leave feedback… until now! We have been in search of a product we could use for facial hair removal, as one of our children has suffered teasing because of facial hair. She is a gorgeous young lady, just lighter skinned. We wondered if laser would work but was not an option b/c of her age. So we have been on the hunt for something that would work.  I was very hesitant, and had already resolved to use the product on myself to see if it caused, redness or bumps…or worked! I was praying it did work as I have to work Monday and wouldn’t want to go in if I had red bumpy patches on my face... I followed the directions and applied the balm as instructed (thin layer rub in 20secs), then applied the cream (upper lip). After about 5-6 minutes I could feel a little tingle.. This was good, I hoped. I left the cream on for 10 minutes, (the package says 6-8” or 10” max)I used a cotton ball with lukewarm water to wipe. Thank GOD, it WORKS! I had no redness, bumps, itching; nothing. I have very sensitive skin so this is a plus product, give it a try. Hope we have solved the teasing of our daughter.</li>
    <li> I shave my upper lip hair and was really hoping to find a product that I could use to remove the hair for at least a week. I waited three full days after shaving. Had to stay home the whole time since I wouldn&#x27;t be seen by anyone with growth. I followed the directions to the letter and after wiping off the creams at least 75% of the hair was still there. What a waste of money! I guess this product is useful for those who don&#x27;t really have upper lip growth that couldn&#x27;t be taken care of by bleaching. Extremely disappointed!!</li>
    <li> For me this product did not really work, the hair removal was minimal, and it grew back quickly.  It did not work on coarser hair at all.  It has a slight odor typical of depilatory products.  I was mostly disappointed in the amount of hair it left behind. I have fine light hair with just a few coarse ones.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this about 3 times now and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve struggled with facial hair for 10 years now. I use this Olay hair remover on my &#x27;peach fuzz&#x27; and it gets rid of it perfectly. I was previously using a facial trimmer and had issues with it pulling hairs out and causing ingrown hairs. I haven&#x27;t tried this on coarser hair (I laser), but i can&#x27;t imagine this product is strong enough to take care of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this about 2-3 times a week. So unfortunately, this tube may last a month or month and a half but if it allows me to actually have a clear face..it&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
    <li> did a good job.  I was very happy with the results and I will purchase it again.it is a great product</li>
    <li> Works great! Have sensitive skin; one small breakout on my face. Usually break out much more with another brand name strip.  My skin is very fair. Be sure to follow instructions. So much easier than those pesky strips and messy waxes.</li>
    <li> I have very fine blonde facial hair.  This I found to be very easy and painless.  I have the smoothest face now.</li>
    <li> Worked really well for me!</li>
    <li> It was OK but for a few dollars more you can get waxed... and be pampered through the ordeal.</li>
    <li> NEW- Today I am trying the test - so in 48 hours I will try the product and will be happy to submit a review at that time.</li>
    <li> I have been waxing my upper lip for years, and find it hard to pencil in time to go to the salon to get it done. I&#x27;ve seen ads for this product, so I figured I would give it a shot. I have fine hair in the middle of my upper lip, and slightly more coarse hair on either edge of my lips. I was a little skeptical, but I just finished using this product for the first time and I am COMPLETELY satisfied. I left the product on for 10 minutes (the max time suggested) because I have the coarser hair on the edge of my upper lip. The product took off 99% of my hair, leaving only a few stray coarse hairs that were easily plucked. I can feel a slight twinge where the product was applied, but that is to be expected - nothing out of the ordinary. I used about a pea size (a little bigger) and have tons left in the tube, so I will definitely be getting my money&#x27;s worth - waxing costs about $10 each time! I would definitely recommend this product; it will pay for itself over time if you are used to going to a salon for waxing frequently, like myself! Thanks, Olay!</li>
    <li> I was NOT pleased with this product.  Left marks on my face &amp; had to use a first-aid cream.&lt;br /&gt;Will NOT buy again.</li>
    <li> Worked pretty well! My skin has always turned red and irritated with hair removal products. I didn&#x27;t have that problem with this at all. It didn&#x27;t do that well on my 1 chin hair, but the upper lip is smooth and nice. Smell is pretty non-offensive. I&#x27;m a fan! Cheaper on Amazon than anywhere I had seen it.  No complaints!</li>
    <li> i have tried three times and the product did not work, i used as directed and no hair was removed at all.. do not waste your money</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad i purchased this product, facial hair is a big problem for me. The first time I used this product it didnt work very well, but i tried again a second time and the results were much better. The trick is to keep on the removal cream for a little longer than suggested. Depending on how thin or thick the hair is. I&#x27;d suggest This product! Its been two weeks since my first treatment and I&#x27;m just now beginning to see a few new hairs sprouting up. Thumbs up to Olay for this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 50 years old and have been using the Emjoi epilator to remove the peach fuzz on the lower half of my face (which has gotten heavier the older I get). This cream worked beautifully. I used the protective balm first, applying it generously and rubbing it in, extending beyond where I wanted to remove the hair. Then I put a fairly thick coat of the remover on all around my face. I covered my upper lip, cheeks and chin and slightly under my chin (like a man about to shave). I left it on for exactly 8 minutes. I think if I left it on any longer it would&#x27;ve irritated my skin (I&#x27;m fair with light hair, light eyes). I couldn&#x27;t have asked for it to work any better, face is smooth, hairless and my makeup goes on much better now. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because my skin felt greasy for a day or two afterwards but that went away. I&#x27;ll be buying this again and throwing away my tweezer torture device!</li>
    <li> I just used this product today, and my chin and side burn area look and feel amazing!! I had a little irritation, but I think this is because I did not rub the balm over enough area. I will definitely use this product again.</li>
    <li> Just follow the directions and -voila!  No hair!  It even got some nasty dark hairs above the lip that waxing can&#x27;t get rid of.  No burning or irritation at all.  There&#x27;s a slight smell but not a big deal.</li>
    <li> I like this product because,&lt;br /&gt;1) Soft on skin, yet effective. It does not cause any side effect(rashes) on skin.&lt;br /&gt;2) Simple, easy to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dint give a 5 star because, It does not remove even &#x27;slightly thicker hair&#x27;(near jaw line). It sticks to only &#x27;very thin&#x27; hair.</li>
    <li> This product worked, but I had to use it twice and the second time it caused two small holes in my upper lip, which I am guessing was irritation from having to use the product twice. I will use the rest of the product but will not buy again. If you have sensitive skin, I do not reccomend this product.</li>
    <li> Works really well. Does not have a strong odor.  Easy to use.  Last about 3 weeks between treatments.</li>
    <li> first of all i an upset because i bought this product in pharmacy and overpaid $10. Which is a lot considering todays economy and me being unemployed. But other then that it does its job. Smooth and painfree hair removal. Although scent reminds me of veet cream... Maybe it is but less concentrated to theat sensitive area...</li>
    <li> Wow, I was surprised by this product. It worked much better than I expected it to. My first time putting this on didn&#x27;t work at all and I became instantly disappointed. I decided to give the product another try and it worked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this product didn&#x27;t work for you there are a few reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) The smoothing balm needs to be applied very lightly. Just dab in overlapping circles, do not swipe over the areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.) The removal cream needs to be applied quite thickly over the area. I noticed on one side that I applied it to a little less, it didn&#x27;t remove very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.) This product is for FINE to MEDIUM hair. They make a product for coarse hair now. If you have thicker hair, try the coarse removal cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave this a four instead of a five was the product didn&#x27;t remove some of the smaller finer hairs. I still had to tweeze but thankfully only a little.&lt;br /&gt;And the other reason is the smell! Yuck. Other than that, highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I was a little nervous to use this since I have sensitive skin, but it worked great.  I had to apply it twice, since I didn&#x27;t know how my skin would react and I may have applied it too lightly the first time.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. A bit more pricey than the usual products presented on the shelf of the market place.  However, it does have the affect of not hurting the skin.  The little cream put on before the actual hair removal really does the job.  No redness at all on the face afterwards.  A great product.</li>
    <li> I used Olay smooth finish facial hair remover on my facial hair and it works better than any other product that I have used.</li>
    <li> Seemed to work the first time but after that it didn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;m on the fence whether I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased. I&#x27;d tried other products but they just didn&#x27;t remove all the hair, or they left stubble. This product effectively removed the hair on my lip, above my nose and under my eyebrows. I left it on for 10 minutes, removed it with a cotton ball, washed my face in cool water, and applied a thin layer of antibiotic cream. I had no breakout or chafing or redness; my skin was very smooth after the treatment. I&#x27;ll buy this again.</li>
    <li> Difficult &amp; ineffective for all the trouble.</li>
    <li> After seeing so many bad reviews I was really intimidated. But I am sooooo glad that I made this purchase. The result was AMAZING for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product under my nose, on my forehead and two sides of my cheek (I have dry and sensitive skin in these area) and I messaged the protection balm very carefully before applying hair remover. After I removed the product using a cotton pad I was surprised to see my hair come off like removing dirt from my face. Relatively speaking it did not work as well under my nose but I was impressed with the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend trying this!</li>
    <li> Surprised at high reviews, used this last summer...left permanent redness on my chin as well as a tiny bump, neither have gone away...I would never use this again.  Update, now 8-2013, permanent redness does indeed appear to be permanent.  I did do the test &amp; followed instructions carefully.  I don&#x27;t write reviews unless I really love or really dislike a product.  I don&#x27;t want other people to have my experience.</li>
    <li> I followed the directions carefully and was extremely disappointed when much hair was left in place.  It also irritated the area close to lip.  Back to the electric shaver.</li>
    <li> When I applied to my lip hair for the second time, it didn&#x27;t work anymore.</li>
    <li> Just got this in the mail....first use, amazing, no hair left at all. No more going to get waxed anymore. This was so easy and worked better then waxing!</li>
    <li> Have to say that the 1st time I used it, I was not impressed. It didn&#x27;t even remove all the hair. But since I had paid for the product, I continued to use and after few times I see the benefit. Now, it does remove all the hair and the underlying skin also remains smooth. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this lasts a long time worth the price</li>
    <li> Heh. Did not work at all . I followed directions and nothing came off. Waste of money...</li>
    <li> I have fuzz all over my face and coarse hairs on chin.  I bought the medium/coarse formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say use the balm in the \\&quot;middle\\&quot; of the area to be treated.  Well, the forehead and cheek areas are a lot wider than, for example, the upper lip, so how does one know how much to use on the bigger areas?  The instructions warn to not use too much or too little balm.  Gee, Olay, thanks for the help.  NOT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did the best I could, trying to use too little balm as opposed to too much, figuring the worst that would happen is more skin irritation if I erred on the side of too little.  And the result was . . . next day my chin hairs are back and there&#x27;s stubble on my upper lip.  So I&#x27;d say this is a big fail. Maybe I&#x27;ll try to return it to Walmart and see if I can get my money back.  $24 is lot for a product that doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could, I&#x27;d give it zero stars.</li>
    <li> Smells bad, It is like a cheap hair removal cream. I would not recommend to use this product anywhere on the face. I wanted to return it but the return policy does not permit you to return</li>
    <li> I was so dissapointed in this product was highly recommended  and did not work  I have unwanted facial hair above lip and below chin Tried 2 seperate times to use this product and it did not remove the hair</li>
    <li> I ordered this product after reading good reviews even though it is pricey but it was a disappointment, it didn&#x27;t do anything for me. It is definitely not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Works great even if you have sensitive skin and if nothing else worked try this! Its a small amount for a steep price but its worth it if other things have irritated your face. I love it</li>
    <li> I have fine, light hair on my face and prefer to remove.  This product works but it has an unpleasant smell.</li>
    <li> There were mixed reviews about this product, but I decided to try it anyway because I wanted perfectly smooth skin to last longer than shaving allows. I tried this twice, two weeks between sessions, and these are my results...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I layered on the balm fairly thick because I do have sensitive skin and wanted to be sure that it did not burn me like Nair always has. I only left on for the minimum requirement before wiping off with cotton discs and a damp cloth. As soon as it was all removed my skin felt very raw, so I applied two layers of moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day my face felt a little tingly, and I applied moisturizer a couple times through out the day. The day after that, I woke up with little tiny bumps around my chin and jaw line and my face looked really dry. This continued for over a week before it finally went away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second time I tried this product I layered the balm even thicker and made sure it extended even further down my chin and jaw line so no hair remover could touch my skin. Unfortunately, I got the same results as above. I guess it isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product. It doesn&#x27;t even work as well as the cheap facial hair removers. I have VERY fine, light blonde hair on my lip and used as directed, leaving on for 10 minutes. It didn&#x27;t even remove all of my fine hair. The price is what brings in my low rating - it was $27 (!!!!) at my local drugstore. The &#x27;balm&#x27; it comes with is just like chapstick. Stick with the cheap stuff that works better.</li>
    <li> Still burned my skin, granted I have pretty sensitive skin.  Thought about giving it a second try but just too embarrassing.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this Olay Smooth Finish Facial Hair Removal Duo it didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t remove all the hair on the place I applied it.</li>
    <li> This works very well.  It tingles a bit, but that sensation goes away quickly.  I&#x27;m grateful for a product like this that works!</li>
    <li> This product works well and is easier on the skin than other products I have tried.  It&#x27;s just TOO expensive!!</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me at all.  I used it on my chin hair, which I considered to be in the medium category.  The hair on my head I put into the course category.  I followed the instructions twice.  Not one hair was removed.  Had to resort to the tweezer method.  The product is expensive, so I&#x27;m really disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: month later.  Tried it about 5 times today.  Still no effect.  I must have not gotten the protective gel in the right place because I was bleeding when I removed it.  Just a little bit, but enough to know this isn&#x27;t the product for me.  Really disappointed because my sight is fading and it&#x27;s really getting hard to see these hairs for plucking.</li>
    <li> Im pretty fair and have older, thin skin but sadly the chin hairs seem to sprout with aging .  This product works well for me.  It is gentle and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  There are still a few stubborn coarse hairs that I have to pluck but the rest of my face is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind after using this cream.  it smells of course so I wipe off my face after application with baby wipes so I can throw away, rather than washing down the sink, as the smell seems to linger in the bathroom otherwise.</li>
    <li> Great product on-time delivery!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in this product. I had high hopes for it but it really doesnt do any better of a job than the much less expensive brand I was using to remove the hair on my upper lip. Actually, the other product seems to work longer. This one seems to make it feel much more stubbly and leaves select hairs. I read the directions a few times since I was thinking maybe I had used it incorrectly or hadnt left it on long enough- nope I used it correctly and for the proper length of time. I really feel that for this price and the amount of product you get and for the length of time it works it is not worth it.</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions exactly and was greatly disappointed. It left many hairs behind and irritated my skin. Not worth it for the price at all.</li>
    <li> was disappointed it doesnt work</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t remove the hair cleanly.  A little disappointed.  maybe better on fair hair</li>
    <li> The best removal cream I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s never burned my skin even when i leave it on too long. No redness, no pain or drying skin. Great.</li>
    <li> It is very easy to use, and afterwards my area above my upper lip was very soft and smooth.  But... after 1 week I could feel the fine hairs returning.  Was disappointed that the fine hairs grew back so quick.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, I have sensitive skin, and I had no irritation at all.</li>
    <li> This is the only facial hair remover I use.  First was introduced to me through Costco maybe four years or so ago.  Does an excellent job in under five minutes (10 minutes is too long for me.)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of facial hair, and did leave the product on for long enough. It didn&#x27;t do anything! Also because I tried to remove the hair really hard that I had to rub it quite harshly. Later my skin was feeling funny for a couple of days! Not good.</li>
    <li> So easy and does the trick.  :)  Highly recommend this product.  Gets rid of the peach fuzz and extra hairs.</li>
    <li> The product would pretty good, as I reached my 60 I noticed facial hair which I don&#x27;t want to have</li>
    <li> the fine to medium didn&#x27;t work well for me i wanted the med to coarse but you were out so i tried the other one.</li>
    <li> I would not even give it a one star if I had a choice about it.  This stuff is horrible and stinks so bad that you better use it outside.  It amazes me that people will actually write positive reviews on a product that does not work.  I have very few hairs and they are blonde and very fine.  It does not work on&lt;br /&gt;me nor anyone else that I know.  It sickens me that so many people will actually lie in order to get a product for free.  Shameful</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work all that well.  You have to use it multiple times if you want it to fully remove hair.  At that point you would of burned your skin using it again.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a nice alternative to Nair which as most people know if extremely harsh for the skin.  It comes with a pre-balm and smells much more pleasant and helps protect the skin from the chemicals. However, after the first use (8 mins) it left a blond stubble). Not attractive. I used it again for 10 minutes a couple days later and it did it a better job. For reference I am using it for light, fine, blond peach fuzz on my face post baby. I am not extremely hairy nor do I have dark course hair. It is much more expensive then nair and it comes in two very tiny tubes in a giant box which is totally unnecessary not to mention not environmental.&lt;br /&gt;I think it is a bit overpriced for what it is but it is better then nair simply because its gentle on the skin, not because it does a better job.</li>
    <li> I have used most of the OTC facial hair removers for my lip. They work but I dont like the smell and I have probably damaged my skin a time or two. I did not think that a product that uses balm first, could remove the hair, but it did. My hair is probably fine, with one or two coarser hairs. Because I had the original kit, I didnt hold out much hope for either type of hair. However, they are all gone! Less smell, and no irritation. I will use again.</li>
    <li> Not only did this product not remove hair but it burns the skin on your face.  I actually used the coarse hair one but I can&#x27;t find that one on here.  I did exactly as instructed, used the balm first, rubbed it in, put the hair remover on thickly for 8-10 minutes and the little hairs are still there, and now where I applied the product the skin is red and irritated, even feels a little like when you get anesthetic at the dentist(a little numb).  I am apply Neosporin and staying far away from all cream hair removers.</li>
    <li> Although I have sensitive skin, I found this product worked very well without any redness or sensitivity.  It removed the coarse hairs on my upper lip and chin that I have had to pluck or shave before now.  I am impressed that a product actually does what it says it will!  Thank you, Olay! I am recommending this to all my friends, bringing mustaches and chin hairs out of the closet!</li>
    <li> A waste of money. It did absolutely nothing. My face is on fire and red. Trying to wipe it off was extremely painful. I was so hopeful that this would work. I followed the instructions perfectly. Very upset that I wasted $25 on this.</li>
    <li> My skin is really sensitive to hair removal products like this. I&#x27;ve used the Sally Hansen hair removal product, and it left a nice scar around my lip. The balm is great. I have used this once, and it didn&#x27;t burn at all to speak of. The only area it did burn was my chin because I didn&#x27;t apply enough balm. But you only need a thin layer of balm and I didn&#x27;t apply much if any to that area. My upper lip feels great though. Also, it says leave it on no longer than 8 minutes. Good advice. But the directions are clear and it does remove the stubborn hairs well. All of these home removal kits have good and bad points to them. This one is the best I have come across. If your skin is sensitive and scars easily, go with this one because of the balm. We&#x27;ll see what happens when I use it again...</li>
    <li> It does what it says on the package no gimmicks,the ladies love it.&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend it to all the females with that facial hair they need to remove.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical and hoped it wouldn&#x27;t leave irritation like Nair does...and it didn&#x27;t at all. I waited 10 minutes, for the fine hair on my jaw line, chin and upper lip.  I would recommend to use a dry washcloth when removing it because that takes the hair off instead of wiping with a cool washcloth.  Then once that&#x27;s done, use a damp cloth.  Worked amazing.  Smooth and nice.</li>
    <li> Broke out my face when I used it.  It did a great job of removing unwanted hair, but my face was red and blotchy for days.</li>
    <li> It is very useful for the sensitive skin ones. really does the job without pain. first apply the balm [comes with it] which is like a chapstick  and apply the hair removing cream and then apply the protection balm. you are done without a single rash</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work like I expected. Removes some of the hair but never gets it all.  There is really no difference in this and a $6 tube of nair.</li>
    <li> This stuff works but I feel like the hair grows back really quickly. It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> What I really liked about this product is that it was the 1st one not to cause any allergic reaction at all. Not even the redness that I&#x27;m used to even when using tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason why I dont give it all 5 stars it is because only slightly thicker hair, it has a harder time removing it. So... you have to take some more time working around with the tweezers for a better result.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, works great!</li>
    <li> This product worked perfectly. It works pretty much the same way as the other \\&quot;hair dissolving\\&quot; products. I don&#x27;t really have sensitive skin so when I did the test, it didn&#x27;t feel like anything. Overall very satisfied. It did everything I expected.</li>
    <li> My first product review on Amazon and unfortunately, it&#x27;s a negative one :(.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like many reviewers out there, I was really excited to try Olay&#x27;s Smooth Finish Facial Hair Removal Duo. It seemed like the perfect solution (much better than shaving like a dude, at least!) to get rid of my upper lip and chin hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product on Friday (kudos for the super fast shipping!) and immediately started the 48-hour reaction test on my forearm. 48 hours later,  there were no adverse side effects on the test spot, so I proceeded to apply the product onto my face. I followed the directions to a tee - first the guarding balm, then a fairly thick layer of the hair removal cream (which I left on for 9 minutes). Yeah, it tingled a bit, but nothing different from other depilatories that I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as soon as I started to wipe the product off and wash my face, I knew something was wrong. My upper lip and chin were red and raw. And they burned. So badly. And to top it all off, the product didn&#x27;t even remove all of the hair! And sadly, it took nearly two days for the redness and burning to completely subside :(.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t mean to be a total debbie downer about this product. From the many reviews here, it seems like it&#x27;s worked wonders for lots of people! I just felt it necessary to put my cautionary tale out there, with an extra advisement for newbies to apply the product for the minimum amount of time (at least for the first application!), just to be safe.</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions and it worked like promised.  I was skeptical because I had used other depilatory products, including Nair, in the past and none worked for me on any part of my body.  I have only used it once and am going to use it again this week.  My skin was left smooth with no redness and the product does not have a strong smell like other creams.  I did test on my arm before application and I will do it again.  Damaging the skin on your face is not worth the risk so always test before each use.</li>
    <li> This was a good product. It took the hair away without any irritation. I have sensitive skin so I was worried but it worked great. I used it a little over 2 weeks ago and just barely have any hair growing back yet. Ive only used it once but I like it and I&#x27;m sure ill buy it again.</li>
    <li> Lousy product, didn&#x27;t work. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> I gave this product four stars because I have VERY sensitive skin, use multiple products on my face and my skin has yet to become irritated. This amazing fact is enough for me to re purchase.</li>
    <li> I wanted to give it a try to see if I can stop using hot wax on my face, but unfortunatly this doesn&#x27;t help, even using the balm on, my skin started to sting. I couldn&#x27;t keep it on for more than two minutes. As others said in their reviews, this is just nair, only fancier and expensier.[[ASIN:B0058AGBYG Olay Smooth Finish Facial Hair Removal Duo (Fine to Medium)1 Kit]]</li>
    <li> I tried the Oil of Olay Smooth Finish Facial Hair Removal Duo for medium to course hair.  It seemed the same as all the other products for facial hair removal that I&#x27;ve tried.  It even smelled the same and I really don&#x27;t like that smell.  The only thing different was it came with a little lip balm type cream you put on before the hair removal cream.  That did seem to provide a barrier for your skin to keep the removal cream from irritating the skin.  The Oil of Olay Facial Hair Removal Duo for medium to course hair did not remove the course hair I have.  It seemed to work on the finer hair.</li>
    <li> I wrote a review the other day when I first received this product about how it was shipped not in the original packaging (it was shipped with the contents, but no Olay box).  I wasn&#x27;t too happy about that, as I feared the product may have been tampered with...  Anyways, I finally did try the product and it works very well.  No irritation and removes hair fast and effectively.  I highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a gentle and effective facial hair remover.  I have extremely sensitive skin and this did not irritate it at all.  I definitely will be purchasing this product for a long time to come.</li>
    <li> I have been going to the salon and using at home wax removal with good results.  The &#x27;at home products&#x27; have been causing break outs on my upper lip.  Wanted to try something different to lower my cost.  I applied Olay 24 hours ago after the test period, and now for gosh sakes I  have stubble.  EEEWWWHHH. I have never had stubble before.  Will this go away soon?  I liked it at first, not pain, but stubble!! I don&#x27;t want to kiss my hubby.  I have 5:00 p.m. stubble, I don&#x27;t see it necessarily, but feel it like a man.  My &#x27;stash&#x27; wasn&#x27;t aweful or heavy just to me annoying.  Help!  what will remedy this?</li>
    <li> I used the product carefully on my upper lip according to directions.  First, the product did not remove all of even the fine hair. Next, I began to have bumps pop up about 30 minutes after use. Next day skin was dry and slightly scaley. The worst was after about two days my morning kiss was greeted with a comment about feeling like I had shaved my upper lip. Not the results I expected after paying about $30.00 for the product.  If I can find my receipt I plan to return it.</li>
    <li> This product was my #1 choice for facial hair removal before finding the REM Spring. It&#x27;s gentle on the skin and romoves the hair at the skin&#x27;s surface. This means facial hair grows back quickly compared to removal items that take hair from the root. I absolutely love the balm that comes with the product and may continue to purchase this product for that alone. Removal cream lasted me about 5 applications and the balm lasted me 15 application which rounded out to about $25.00 monthly.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s obvious this is for sensitive skin. It left my skin feeling soft and the added little conditioning stick is wonderful. The only thing is-it did not remove any stubble-at all. I even extended the time beyond what it recommended and it was still \\&quot;stubborn stubble.\\&quot; I want to find a product that works and also that doesn&#x27;t take half my skin away in the process. This won&#x27;t take the skin away with awful chemical burns but it won&#x27;t take any hair either.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice product that works really well.  I have not experienced any irritation from using the remover although my face is not normally sensitive to many products.  I do experience a small amount of break out in some areas however this is consistent with every other removal method (which includes product application) I have use including visits to expensive salons.  I am set up on subscribe and save with this product and I will continue to receive.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t really remove the hair like it says.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me  the first time, I have to give it one more chance before judging</li>
    <li> I guess most people use this for the upper lip; I haven&#x27;t seen a review for the jaw line area. It doesn&#x27;t say it on the box, but when you break the seal and open the directions it states, \\&quot;works great for jawline area.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I NEVER had any facial hair problem at all until I was pregnant at 26. \\&quot;It&#x27;s just your hormones,\\&quot; that&#x27;s what my doctor told me.&lt;br /&gt; (And just as a weird side-note: I have had four pregnancies; two boys and two girls. Incidentally, when the facial hair was dark it was a boy; when it was blonde it was a girl. Not kidding! I have a friend who has told me the same thing.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ANYWAY...! Then about 5 years after my last child was born, voila! Fuzzy blonde jawline facial hair again. (Yipee for me) Again, my doctor tells me now it&#x27;s my middle-aged hormones. How fun! So I read and heard from many people that facial WAXING was the best way to go because supposedly, over time, the more you wax the finer and thinner the hair is suppose to grow back. And some people have sworn to me that their hair just stops growing back at all over time. Well, that may be true for some people, but I have been waxing for 5 years now and I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in the hair thickness or time it grows back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; But it was my only option I thought. Initially I paid a salon $15 every 4 weeks or so to wax my jaw area, which got too expensive so I thought I would give it a go at home. I purchased some wax strips from the beauty supply store and they were easy to use but I found that no matter how well I could do with my bathroom lighting and a mirror, I always seemed to miss a line of hair or patch here and there around my jaw area (It&#x27;s a real hard area to get by yourself!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I really love this new Olay  Duo!! I just tried it today and it works fabulous on the jawline area. Finally for once I have no missed little patches of hair sticking out. I did not notice a bad smell like niar like some reviews said. It smelled fine. And I&#x27;m pretty sure I accidentally got the white paste on parts that were not covered with the balm (I was in a hurry) and I had no adverse reaction to my VERY sensitive skin. I think that if it doesn&#x27;t work well for some people then they may not be slathering the white paste on thick enough. That is really important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and I would give it 5 start if it weren&#x27;t so expensive. I wish it came in a larger tube.sure I accidentally got the white paste on parts that were not covered with the balm (I was in a hurry) and I had no adverse reaction to my VERY sensitive skin.

    <li> Not a whole lot to say about it. I used it. It worked okay, but not great. It did not remove it all and it was sort of a hassle to use.</li>
    <li> i was looking for an alternative to facial wax strips and this is it! with waxing, i got little pimple like bumps a day or so after along my upper lip. not to mention waxing HURTS. i was hesitant to buy because of the price, but amazon is much cheaper than any drugstore even if you used a coupon. this effectively removed the hair without any pain, redness, or irritation. impressed!</li>
    <li> I think it works good, except that after my skin stayed dry for a few days, and then the hair grew back with in the week.</li>
    <li> Okay, I got this to get rid of some unlady like stubborn straggler hairs. I&#x27;ve already misplaced it somewhere in my bathroom. The one time I used it, it did pretty good cleaning up the stray hairs, though the darker ones (all three or four of them) weren&#x27;t really removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely cheaper here online than at the store, which is why I got it.</li>
    <li> I have fine light hairs on my chin and lip and I followed the instructions exactly and this product did not remove anything.  I would not recommend it.  It did not burn or hurt or leave a rash, but it also did not do the job I bought it to do.</li>
    <li> This was exactly the same as we&#x27;ve been buying at the store.  Perfect!</li>
    <li> I used this once &amp; I was hooked. No more waxing or trying to find the little shaver. My mom bought this &amp; let me try it. I followed the directions &amp; kept it on for 8 minutes &amp; it worked awesome on my upper lip. I did have slight irritation even though I used the protecting balm.</li>
    <li> It works great, love it</li>
    <li> Easy to apply, moisturizer stick to soften skin.  Worked after first application.  Good deal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of bad reactions to depilatories, but not this one!! I heard this was the most gentle it definitely is very gentle-- but not as effective as I&#x27;d like. I have used it twice and had zero redness or issues. It comes with a balm stick that you apply first. I have not had any breakouts, which is good because it feels like I&#x27;m applying Carmex to my face (scary for someone who is acne prone). However, I need to use this over my entire lower face (yes I do, bad face hair genes), and the quantity of the product is pretty limited for the price. So I think I&#x27;ll only get a couple more uses out of it---- Sally Hansens versions allow for more applications for a lot less money (but give me rash). Also, maybe it&#x27;s because of the balm, but I don&#x27;t think this stuff penetrates as deeply to remove the hair. Usually with cream depilatories I&#x27;m good for almost two months before I feel the need to reapply, but with this stuff, within a couple of weeks I&#x27;m annoyed with regrowth. I&#x27;m afraid to not use the balm because this stuff smells exactly like SH, which means my skin will react badly. Now, if all you have to deal with is a small patch of hair like on your lip, this stuff will last you a really long time and do you well form the price.</li>
    <li> This was the first time I have used a facial hair remover product and I was a little skeptical but it was so easy to use and so effective I was very impressed. My face is so smooth and so soft. I have used it twice now with good results both times. I repeated it a month later. I was pleasantly surprised that it kept my face so smooth for that length of time. I will continue to use this product and wonder why I waited so long to try it.</li>
    <li> This product absolutely did not work, not even a little bit. I followed the directions exactly, and still had zero results. Do not waste your money!</li>
    <li> This works really well for me. In fact, I&#x27;ve noticed less re growth of that little upper lip hair. It&#x27;s very gentle on the skin, and I&#x27;m so happy I gave it a try!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, and this product works well.  It is very easy to use, no mess at all.</li>
    <li> This worked perfectly for me. I have fine blonde upper lip hair, and it completely took it off with NO irritation! Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I tried it a few times and couldn&#x27;t get it to work...a waste of money</li>
    <li> I tried the Olay Duo Facial Hair Remover for fine hair after seeing so many positive reviews. Sorry to say it didn&#x27;t work for me, not even the peach fuzz on the side of my face.  I followed the directions to the letter but after waiting for 9 minutes I wiped the cream off and the hair was still on my chin and upper lip.  Face is still tingling after 2 hours and I have to tweeze the hair anyway.  I am desperate to find something to control this facial hair, I get waxed when I go to the hairdresser but need something in between visits. I will try it again to at least use up the product and hope it works next time.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and by that I mean if I rub lotion on my face it will turn red-VERY sensitive skin, so I was worried about using this product. It worked great on my fine blonde facial hair and was non irritating..I use it regularly now.</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with this product. I followed the instructions and it worked beautifully. Also, I have very sensitive skin and this product did not bother me at all![[ASIN:B0076O9NGK Olay Smooth Finish Facial Hair Removal Duo 1 Kit (2 Pack)]]</li>
    <li> I use this everytime i need to wax my lips and it works great! I can&#x27;t use the wax cause it irritatesmy skin but this doesnt</li>
    <li> This product worked really well for me. I have very fine, very blonde hairs on my face, and while noone can actually see them, the hair above my lip bothered me when I looked in the mirror. I do not have sensitive skin, even though it&#x27;s extremely dry, and I&#x27;m not prone to acne. I read the directions, and after one eight minute application, the hair on my upper lip was completely gone. There was a tiny bit of burning/stinging, and my skin was a little red for about an hour afterward, but I just held a cold washcloth over it for a few minutes, and it was fine. I also followed it up with a layer of Neosporin and my moisturizer, just to be safe, but I&#x27;ve had no issues from it. There&#x27;s no lingering redness or sensitivity. This could be a bit harsh for someone with sensitive skin, but it&#x27;s worth trying out.</li>
    <li> I have the unfortunate combination of very sensitive skin with fairly coarse hair coming in with age.  I have discontinued waxing my upper lip and chin, now that I have found a home depilatory that does not irritate my skin.  Follow the directions precisely.  The only drawback is that the amount of depilatory is about half what the amount of pre-treatment balm could accommodate.  The good news is that the pre-treatment can be used with other depilatory creams.</li>
    <li> would not buy this product again.  i thought it would be the answer to painless hair removal.  i honestly believe this product would be more effective for the newer hair growth.</li>
    <li> Must change my rating!  The second time I used this product it burned my skin, didn&#x27;t temove the hair, and my skin peeled later.  I did not do anything differently than the first time I used this product.&lt;br /&gt;Much less painful than the lip wax I&#x27;ve used in the past, with better results than waxing.  In the past I waxed and experienced mixed results, because the wax would remove the dark, heavy hairs, but not the fine hair underneath, which meant that regrowth happened within a week or so.  I like the results achieved with Olay Smooth Finish Facial Hair Removal Duo (Fine to Medium) quite well, because all of the hair has been removed.  Using the product according to directions worked well (product was left on for 8 minutes), but next time I will be more careful in applying a thick enough layer on both sides, because results were better on the side with more product.  Slight soreness of my upper lip was present for about fifteen minutes, but it subsided quickly, without any ointment or moisturizer.  I am olive skinned with very dark brown/black hair, but my &amp;#34;moustache&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t too heavy, because I&#x27;ve waxed it for years.  The strength of the fine to medium kit was just right.</li>
    <li> If you expect this to eliminate the hair completely, buy something else. It is adequate for temporary removal and easy to apply. I use for the upper lip area. It&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> When I first put it on last night, I wasn&#x27;t totally sure it would work. I applied it like it said and it removed most of my facial hair! It left some of the more coarse hair, but I didn&#x27;t expect it to, so no surprise there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give it five stars as you can see, but after I put it on, my skin started to develop red spots... I knew it was probaly the irritation part of the warning kicking in. But after the night, my face was back to normal and most importantly, HAIR FREE! So, in the end this product DID work out for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Olay and Amazon!</li>
    <li> It barely worked yet manage to irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> Compared to other things I have tried this def works however I had to use it twice my upper lip is only a bit sore but not anything I can&#x27;t handle. However when I do run out I will buy from here and not from Walmart its way cheaper here.  I only have one suggestion if you do buy it buy some mosturizer wipes or cream to keep the skin from getting irratated and mosturize the skin. Its A great product I have a feeling a lot of people who gave 1 star reviews didn&#x27;t do it right as I had no problems except the above mentioned about having to do it twice I don&#x27;t think I put enough hair removal cream on so it might be my error anyway stay away from the cheap wax stripes you can buy at CVS they do not work this works better and is a lot less painless.</li>
    <li> So I thought oil of Olay only puts good products on the shelves but i was sadly mistaken!!! Went to the store and its 28$$$. Well this might work because as we all know the no! No! Brand hair removal doesn&#x27;t work. I was soooooo disappointed. I had my sister on face time watching this miracle hair removal process. I followed the directions to a T. I whipped it off and guess what? Not one hair came off!!!! Can someone please come up with a cure for hair removal that actually works!!!!!!!!? Please!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product due to positive reviews and the fact my mother used Oil of Olay for years and she had beautiful skin.  I&#x27;ve tried it 5 times with my fine chin hair and it&#x27;s done nothing.</li>
    <li> Works well!  No red,irritated skin.  Very gentle on sensitive skin.  Would purchase again!</li>
    <li> This is the very best product for removing hair, love it will use it forever</li>
    <li> I just got this in the mail...thought by review it was going to work great ! But I am very dissapointed didnt do anything for me :/</li>
    <li> Smells good, nice packaging, but it doesn&#x27;t work very well as an overall facial hair remover unless I used it wrong. Don&#x27;t throw that razor away just yet.</li>
    <li> It still tends to burn my skin a little. And I don&#x27;t like how the hair breaks off vs being pulled from the root. My hair did not come back in more fine and I quit using it right away. Waxing may hurt more, but it&#x27;s more effective than this kit.</li>
    <li> My hair is very thick on my head and it&#x27;s not atypical that that also leads to eyebrows that need to be plucked and simply more grooming overall. Most women with thick hair often have light hairs (some have dark; fortunately that&#x27;s not my issue) on areas they don&#x27;t want to such as the chin area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have very fine hair on your head then you likely have fine hair on these areas as well. I don&#x27;t. I groom my brows and either dermaplane my chin area or use hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about this system is it&#x27;s great for sensitive skin, which I have. Although my skin is very clear now (it used to break out when I worked out a lot but suddenly produced less oil as I aged and stopped that, thankfully) it is still very sensitive if I switch to harsh products or soaps and often hair removal systems can be harsh. I&#x27;ve had very intense and horrible reactions in the past. This did not lead to that whatsoever so, for me, it did indeed appear good for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like about it is that it really is going to work only if you have fine hair. It will leave behind anything medium or coarse or thick. This may not matter to many people but for those of us with thick hair it means some tweezing after use and that&#x27;s an extra step I&#x27;m not personally crazy about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it says it works well for fine to medium hair, I actually felt that it worked best simply on fine hairs only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for some it may be the perfect match, but for me, it creates a bit extra work for perfect grooming.&lt;br /&gt;Comment</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me the first time just because I didn&#x27;t do a thick enough layer. I tried again though using a thin layer of the protection balm and a thick layer of the cream and it worked perfectly. Lasts a good few weeks. No redness or anything really. It did cause a couple whiteheads just from being irritated a few days later but it&#x27;s not a super big deal, they&#x27;re really small.</li>
    <li> LoveLOVELove......Great product and its worth the price!! No cons for me!! Followed directions and now my chin is VERY smooth, it got rid of all hairs even coarse ones! Im African American and it works on all skin tones!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this twice. The first time I followed the directions carefully and put the skin guarding balm on first. My hair is very fine, can&#x27;t see without great light and a magnifying mirror, but the first time I used this, following directions carefully, it didn&#x27;t work completely. It was a bit disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;So, the second time, I changed it up a bit - - I know this is NOT recommended by the manufacturer. First, you should know my skin is NOT sensitive. So, the second time, I did it backwards. I put the hair removal cream on for seven minutes. It felt a little hot, but my skin did not burn. After the seven minutes passed, I wiped off the removal cream and rinsed my face with water. Then, finally, I put on the skin guarding balm. After a few seconds, my face stopped feeling hot. My skin is not red and the hair removal cream worked just fine!&lt;br /&gt;One word of caution - - - the directions specifically say, do not use on moles, I have a mole above my lip and accidentally got some on it. It just felt like it was burning a bit, but on me it didn&#x27;t cause any other problems.</li>
    <li> There are 2 versions of this product. The one I bought which you see above (Fine to Medium) and then there is Medium to Coarse.  This is the one I recommend. If you have unwanted facial hair you have probably had it for a while and it&#x27;s coarse. I wouldn&#x27;t get the Fine to Medium. It won&#x27;t work even f you keep it on longer. When I used this product it was easy and it didn&#x27;t burn or cause any irritation.</li>
    <li> I used this product after conducting research using Amazon and the reviews posted for these types of products.  This one seemed the most efficient for removing facial hair on the upper lip without any additional side effects.  I used this product for  the first time last night and completed using the instructions included.  I left the cream on for 8 minutes, and yes there is a negative smell after the 8 minutes are completed because of the type of product this is, its similar to Nair but is gentle for your face.  The smell is the least of my worries however and it is worth it to get rid of the little hairs on my upper lip.  I have experienced no side effects, no redding, burning, itching, etc. other than normal.  therefore I have given this product 5 starts for now, if anything changes I will let you know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will now see how long it takes for the hair to grow back and how course the hair is upon return.</li>
    <li> So basically, I use it like the instruction says to. I never leave it on longer than 10 minutes; usually taking it off around the 9 minute mark. The first time I used this, it missed a couple of hairs. Not being a particular picky person, I waited a week to retry. The second time, it cause half my upper lip to go numb, ran down onto my eyebrows and took some of that off, and it STILL DID NOT GET RID OF THE HAIR. It was not thick, it was rather fine. Not so fine people could not see it though.&lt;br /&gt;Overall use a different brand or wax. Waxing hurts, but seems to leave much better results.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical about this product plus the price tag has kept me from purchasing. I finally caved in a bought it. I&#x27;ve been using surgicream and it always burned my skin even though it claimed it was extra sensitive and only had a 4 minute application.  I never write reviews but was so happy with this product I wanted to share. I put the balm on waited 8 minutes and no hair and more importantly no irritation! I have blonde hair with some darker stray pieces so the fine to medium worked great for me! I&#x27;d say if you have darker hair to use the medium to coarse one that recently hit stores. Great product and can justify the price paid.</li>
    <li> This was the perfect product for me although I don&#x27;t think it would be quite as effective for people with heavy or coarse hair growth.  Most of my facial hair is very soft and fair so it was extremely effective for me.  It was also the first product of this type that did not irritate my skin.  I&#x27;ll be buying again.</li>
    <li> Wether it is extra cold or extra hot, too much hair can be a dreadful experience. If you have soft to delicate skin, when you choose a depilitory cream, you need to be very careful.I must stress careful, since it can feel like acid burns when something too strong bites into your skin. The routine as prescribed by OLAAY SMOOTH FINISH is about 15 minutes, and the preparation and processing time works well.You put the skin guarding balm on first, and then apply the cream to remove the hair. In any area, always test on an area that is not likely to be visible but is similar to the visible skin, this makes sure that you don&#x27;t have that just acid washed feel on your skin; yes I know, a moderately funny jibe, but it gets the point. Apply with care, and the cream can pay back with its quality removal. If that fails, just try NO NO !!</li>
    <li> She realy has sensitive skin, to use over lip, and this is the first product that does not have any adverse effects when removing facial hair on her.</li>
    <li> I have used this before and it seems to do a pretty good job</li>
    <li> Sigh.  I remember back to the days of my 20’s when the only facial hair I was fighting was keeping a unibrow at bay. The days of that battle are long gone and won.  At 50 began a new round of fun.  Blonde and white facial hair popping up as peach fuzz and whiskers.  I was skeptical about the product, and desperate.  After testing an area and following the instructions, it worked!  I did sections at various times over a couple of days.  I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So does Olay make a cream that removes the middle age spread?</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good,I like this.</li>
    <li> I rarely waste money, and even more rarely write reviews. But if I can stop someone else from throwing money away, then it&#x27;s worth the effort. I bought this for chin hair that is just a little coarse -- and the product does claim to be effective for that and suggests a 10-minute application for it. I followed directions completely... once last week and once this week. Then I threw the whole box away. There was absolutely NO hair removal. Nothing whatsoever. Shame on you, Olay.</li>
    <li> Love how it works. Not tingle or sting while processing. Will have to be sure to get it on thick enough over all areas next time.</li>
    <li> Did a perfect job of hair removal. It did not hurt my skin, either.  Will use it again and again.  Pat</li>
    <li> I used the product as per the instructions. However, I probably should have done the 48 hour allergy test. But by the time I was ready to use it for first time, my hair had already grown out and I didn&#x27;t know there was a test I should have done and I was inpatient to use it. Anyway, everything worked out as it should have. I initially left it on for less than 10 minutes and it did not take all the hair off so when I did the other side, I did the full 10 minutes instead and it finally took all the hair off (with a little bit of rubbing involved from my cotton pad). I don&#x27;t have thick hair but I still had to leave it on for the full 10 minutes to actually take all the hair off. I didn&#x27;t have any redness on my skin but halfway through the process my skin did start itching and burning a little bit. I didn&#x27;t want to take any chances so as soon as I got all the cream off and had cleaned my skin with water, I used my prescription eczema cream to help soothe the skin irritation and to also prevent any redness from occurring (make sure you have some kind of allergy cream handy!). I gave this product 4 stars because it works but the tradeoff is dealing with the discomfort during the process.</li>
    <li> I liked this product idea right from the start.  There is really nothing out there that gets rid of &amp;#34;goat hair&amp;#34; on the chin like this product.  It&#x27;s safe, it doesn&#x27;t irritate or make that area red or swollen and with fair English skin...that says something right away.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the price which is marked up way too high for most of us to afford.  The purchase on Ebay made it definitely affordable!</li>
    <li> It does as it says, but hair grows way too fast afterwards. I need to use it every couple of days.</li>
    <li> Removes facial hair without irritating my skin just as advertised.  Easy &amp; quick to use.  Cheaper than waxing, plus no redness or bumps like sometimes happens with waxing.</li>
    <li> This is good.  Not great.  It removes the longer finer hairs, but definitely leaves a little fuzz and absolutely does *not* take care of the dark coarse hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product is good for keeping things &amp;#34;maintained&amp;#34;, but don&#x27;t throw out those tweezers just yet.</li>
    <li> I have been a cosmetologist for 8 years, and have struggled with my facial hair since I was 11 (now 30). I have tried just about every hair removal that is done in a Salon or at home (I said Salon and spa, not medical spa). I was very excited about this product, because waxing irritates my skin, and tweezing each hair off my chin and upper lip takes a very long time with two kids running around. And, I am a HUGE fan of Olay products. All the of the women in my family use their face wash and moisturizer, so I swear by their products....usually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have VERY course hair...like a man, seriously. So, I purchased the Med to Course hair. It took away the hair..and I was SO IMPRESSED by seeing all of my hair on the cotton ball. I got so excited I SHREIKED! Until, I FELT MY CHIN. It was as if touching my husbands 5 o&#x27;clock shadow. So, now I am walking around with stubble next to my red lips and pretty earrings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this product 3 stars because I was impressed how it \\&quot;somewhat\\&quot; removed my course hair...but just wish my skin was softer afterwards.</li>
    <li> This past year, I noticed that my cheeks and upper lip were getting HAIRY!! Omfg, this is not acceptable. Thankfully, I discovered the Olay hair removal kit, and it HAS CHANGED MY LIFE. My cheeks are silky smooth, as is my delicate upper lip area. Before Olay? I was GRIZZLY. After Olay? Smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom. FOR 6 WEEKS! Okay, I&#x27;ve been drinking a bit, BUT I&#x27;m wearing the Olay hair removal system AS I TYPE. So you can even remove your facial hair WHILE SLIGHTLY INTOXICATED. It&#x27;s that good. Seriously, what are you waiting for?</li>
    <li> This is the only thing that works on blonds. It does need to be a little stronger.</li>
    <li> I used it immediately when I got it. I&#x27;ve used Nair before on my legs, and I didn&#x27;t have an allergic reaction, so since they&#x27;re similar products I pretty much knew I was gonna be fine using it on my face. I used it exactly as the directions say, and I waited the WHOLE 10 minutes.  I feel like a lot of people just do the 6-8 minutes, and that&#x27;s not enough time. Those 2-4 extra minutes do wonders. I felt a little tingling but I wasn&#x27;t uncomfortable, and when I wiped it off, all of the hairs had came off, no problem. No allergic reaction either! I&#x27;m soooo happy it worked, now I don&#x27;t have to go to the waxer &amp; be in total pain, it was worth the 20 dollars. Itll basically pay for itself in 2 more uses. I&#x27;d reccomend it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for the price.  Removes all the peach fuzz with minimal irritation, leaving my skin smooth.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me at all. I have a hair that grows on both side of my upper lip and i hate it. Normally I would use the Sally Hansen Hair Removal Cream, but after awhile that stopped working for whatever reason. So, I decided to try something new in hopes that it would work. I followed all of the instructions carefully. I even did the 48-hour allergy test that they suggest you do, and I did not have an allergic reaction. I used the balm and then the hair removal cream. I leave it on for 8 minutes and I notice that my pores are open and the hair has been brought to the surface. I wiped my top lip thinking the hair was going to rub off, but it did not. My top lip looked worse than when I started. All this product did was open my pore, and bring the hair out. It did not remove the hair at all.</li>
    <li> Does not work well at all.</li>
    <li> did not work any better than nair for face</li>
    <li> This product worked, but I have such sensitive skin with sun damage, It won&#x27;t be possible to leave it on my skin for the recommended amount of time.  I will try it again and leave it on for two or three minutes. I expect it won&#x27;t be quite as effective, but it is the only way I will be able to use it.</li>
    <li> disappointed with this product.  Didn&#x27;t feel like it worked as advertised</li>
    <li> The prepping balm is very important as others do not include anything like this. You don&#x27;t have to worry about red spots on your face. I&#x27;ve tried other products, but this is the most effective for me.</li>
    <li> I have fine, blond hair on upper lip. This is easy to use and works well.</li>
    <li> I used this for my first time about 20 min. ago. I put it on as directed, super easy, and left it on for 10 min. It removed about 98.5% of the hair. I have psoriasis and extra sensitive skin. This was the first product, (and I&#x27;ve tried many), to not leave any redness behind. Zero irritation! Pleasant smell! Easy to use! Effective!</li>
    <li> I actually bought this at a local wholesale warehouse (Costco) where you could buy two and it would cost less overall. First, don&#x27;t be fooled by those horrid commercials promising less irritation. I bought this because I love olay products, and although I don&#x27;t normally have sensitive skin, I thought this product would be great to try. So, in saying that, this has to be the worst product I have ever used for hair removal. The smell is exactly the same as any hair removal product, aka Nair. Yes, it does get all of the upper lip hair off, but when the cream is removed, I am left with an extremely irritated red skin. The irritated skin, which feels like a sunburn, eventually turns into a weird form of upper lip acne that takes about a week to clear up. Also, if you do not use the balm before you apply the hair removal cream, you will be sorry. I felt like when I applied it as directed, with the balm prior to cream, to more coarse hair it didn&#x27;t do anything. So I tried without the balm, and it definitely got rid of the coarse hair... along with some of the skin-- to the point it actually looks like I scraped my chin. Overall, I feel like I wasted my money on a more expensive product that gave me the same results as a cheaper product. I think waxing is probably the easiest and fastest way to get rid of unwanted hair that doesn&#x27;t keep my skin irritated and red for more than a day. Overall, I am still an Olay product fan, but this product is just a bust.</li>
    <li> I bought this product hoping it would remove the few hairs above my lips.  I followed the instructions, the first time leaving the removal cream on for 6 minutes, did not work, next time tried leaving it on for 8 minutes, did not work, was going to try 10 minutes, but accidently left it on for 12 minutes, did not work.</li>
    <li> I tested this hair remover, it was a bit red but then went away. A week later I tried using it on my lip and chin and it turned bright red and swelled up. The next day I had red bumps everywhere and it hurt so bad to even put aloe on it. Would not recommend for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! It doesn&#x27;t get 100% of the hair off like waxing does but it gets about 95% without any pain. Or redness! I am completely satisfied with this product and would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> It removed the finer hairs but not the course hairs.</li>
    <li> I purchased the medium to coarse product and looked forward to using it.  Once again, like others have said, it did not work. To be honest, I do not think it removed any hair at all.  I did both my lip and my chin.  The chin has coarser gray hair and that appears to have not been toughed.  Like so many others, I am really disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Miss Viv</li>
    <li> I seldom write reviews but for this product, I have to write one. Please note the distribution of review ratings (many 1 star reviews) before considering the purchase. I chose to be ignorant and thought this would not apply to me, but it did. My skin has always been healthy and not allergic to any product, peel or microdermabrasion procedure. However, this product gave me such a severe burn that I had to ice my face for half a day. Like other reviewers have mentioned, the burn did not start until I wiped off the product at the 6-minute mark. Then it was excruciatingly painful and my face turned bright red. I was so scared that this caused permanent damage to my face. I could not put anything on my face but aloe vera gel. For the following week, my skin felt very taut and looked tanned. Now, 3 weeks later, my skin is still very sensitive and I wonder if it will ever return to its former condition. Please take my word of advice and DO NOT PURCHASE this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that Olay has responded to all of the negative reviews in an attempt to appease customers. Honestly, Olay should do the right thing and remove this hazardous product from the market instead of pointless follow-ups. I really question Olay&#x27;s quality control policies as the product obviously has caused severe reactions on many people. Please DO NOT PURCHASE.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this product, because I enjoy most other Olay products.  My skin is rather sensitive, and this product did not irritate it.  For those who had problems, the key seems to be the &amp;#34;prep&amp;#34; stage of applying the protectant.  I left the product on my face (upper lip and chin areas) for the maximum recommended 8 minutes. The tiny fine hairs disappeared, but the long coarse chin hairs didn&#x27;t budge - I still had to break out the tweezers. Will continue to use the rest of the product, but most likely will try something else next.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 58 years old, have a lot of facial hair of all lengths and colors.  Some white, some grey, and some dark.  Some of them are thick whiskers, but most are a fine, thick downy covering.  In the past I tried Nair.  It stung, stunk and didn&#x27;t work. I have been shaving almost daily for several years, and plucking the whiskers.  I thought, \\&quot;what the heck, I like Olay products, and I&#x27;ll try the facial hair removal.\\&quot;  It&#x27;s fabulous!  It is easy, pleasant smelling, and best of all, my face is smooth again, with no hair.  I&#x27;m a fan!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addition:  The results lasted for 2 weeks.  I used it a 2nd time with equally good results.  It doesn&#x27;t take off the whiskers, but I didn&#x27;t expect it too. Just be sure to follow the directions.</li>
    <li> Great, need to leave in longer thenyiu have to with other brands</li>
    <li> I cannot attest to this product&#x27;s efficacy with a significant hair problem.  But it quickly removes a bit of fuzz with no irritation.  The odor is not pleasant.  It is mild though and you only have to put up with it for a few minutes.</li>
    <li> I love oil of oily face products. Have been using it since my mother introduced it to me. So i was very surprised this product DID NOT WORK. Now it is too late to return it.</li>
    <li> I saw this on a talk show and they raved over it. Well, something is wrong because this is not so great. I&#x27;ve given it 2 tries now and my chin hairs are still there! My chin is very soft probably from the conditioner you have to put on first and rub it in for 20 seconds in a circular motion. Then you put the smelly hair remover cream on and wait 8 - 10 minutes. Then you carefully wipe it off with a cotton ball or soft tissue. I have those little round cotton pads and used those. So disappointing. My hairs were still there. It seemed like maybe a few hairs were gone but I think I was just hoping! I&#x27;m going to give it a 3rd try and will report back if there are any changes.</li>
    <li> Love this kit. It works quickly and doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin. Other brands have left red irritation marks on my skin — I&#x27;ve never had that issue with this kit. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it&#x27;s mildly wasteful. I&#x27;ve purchased the kit 3 times. The cream ALWAYS runs out before the balm. I&#x27;ve actually kept all three balms and am still using the balm from the first kit, but with the cream from the third kit. Wish you had the option to purchase the kit components a la carte, or they should give you about half the balm… Or more of the cream! But as far as does it work? The answer is yes.</li>
    <li> Takes a while before I need use it again as it is so good at removing ALL the hair. It grows back in very slower and more fine. It&#x27;s about 2 mos. before I use it again and even then just little fuzzes. I am dark completion and have lots of hair. LOVE THIS STUFF</li>
