      <li>Headgear seems to be a good replacement for the original.</li>

      <li>Great fit and arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>It does stretch out more than I think it should and needs readjusting about once a month.</li>
      <li>so I have make another order which means more shipping cost.</li>
      <li>When I ordered I wasn&#x27;t completely sure it was the correct harness for my mask</li>
      <li>Okay, the photo shows clips.</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t tell for sure from the picture or the description.</li>
      <li>It has the ResMed logo on it and the seller assured me that it wasn&#x27;t a knock-off, but it sure looks like a knock-off to me.</li>
      <li>Good price, no longer have insurance that covers this product so it was nice to find this at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>works great with new mask</li>
      <li>Glad they had it, sent it promptly, it works fine.</li>
      <li>Way better fit.</li>
      <li>Way better than the Medium I originally received with the unit.  </li>
      <li>This product fit the mask prefectly, is fully adjustable, easy to get on and off.  </li>
      <li>Had a medium and worked fine</li>
      <li>Is this a cheap knockoff?</li>
      <li>It is important to pay attention to the letters in the description in order to order what you want.</li>
      <li>I feel cheated, I bought this item based on the photo which shows the clip on the ends to secure mask, however this clip does not come with the item.</li>
      <li>Comfortable</li>
      <li>this is an important aprt of my ResMed CPAP system, which I use every night since it was prescribed 3 months ago.</li>
      <li>It got here fast and it is so nice to have a strap where the Velcro works.</li>
      <li>Would have rated this higher, but the 3 day shipping took more than a week to get to me.</li>
      <li>Just like the original.  </li>
      <li>I switched from a ResMed Quattro full face mask to the Quattro FX.  </li>
      <li>nice replacement for my old one that had the velcrow wear out.  </li>
      <li>Many thanks for everything</li>
      <li>The ResMed Mirage Quattro FX Full Face Mask Headgear (Medium)  </li>
      <li>the good side is that it fits well enough for me to use for now.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It needs to be re-designed so that they fit higher on a persons head.</li>
      <li>Much better fit now that I&#x27;ve replaced my stretched out mask.</li>
      <li>The product is good at first then it wears down where the velcro strap wont stay on.</li>
      <li>I use this brand of headgear and in order for me to get a good seal, i have to have it so tight that it cuts the circulation off in my neck.  </li>
      <li>I ordered a facemask kit that came with a much higher quality headgear than this one.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I need for my bi pap.</li>
      <li>Initially this headgear fits okay.  </li>
      <li>And More has decided to sell the unit as not fully operational unless you spend an additional ten dollars for clips.</li>
      <li>fits better and stays in place better than any other mask and headgear I have ever used!!!!</li>
      <li>The upper straps fit right across the ears and causes cuts in them.</li>
      <li>I worked on my old one and put a cross strap on it when it finally lost its elasticity, but surely there is something better.</li>
      <li>The different way that it fit, caused some neck pain for the first month of using it.</li>
      <li>Changing to a large I guess.  </li>
      <li>Fits well, but velcro wears out really fast.</li>
      <li>These face mask headgear work very well.</li>
      <li>its very rigid,  broke the face mask, strapping this in.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>This went with the mask, and again, how much &amp;#34;like&amp;#34; is there for headgear, really?</li>
      <li>Aside from that, the headgear is the same quality as my original ResMed headgear that lasted over 2 years.</li>
      <li>A couple of things left me feeling less than good about this purchase.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I ordered keeps me alive</li>
      <li>The only downside is that, for those of us who make a lot of adjustments, the wear quickly.</li>
      <li>The head gear has stretched some and now a little more comfortable.</li>
      <li>Had new velcro attachments and elastic band, it works much better than my old one because loose grip after 1 year of use.</li>
      <li>The headgear wasn&#x27;t even in an original ResMed bag, but some generic clear bag, leaving it unclear if this was new or used.</li>
      <li>I even have some soft cloth wrapped around the strap but it doesn&#x27;t help much.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Charge me a few bucks more, but dont annoy your customers....because we won&#x27;t be your customers again.</li>
      <li>Been over a year since i had a new one.</li>
      <li>It should have came with new connectors.</li>
      <li>If you get a new mask, the clips come with it.  </li>
      <li>But in the future I am going to buy my headgear from a local store where I can try on the fit before purchasing it.</li>
      <li>will certainly be more careful what I buy in the future.</li>
      <li>even thou we bought the same size, it said Medium, the one we got is much smaller than the one he had, it didn´t fit him at all....</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s thin and cheaply made, not at all like my headgear that originally came with my mask.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>Sized WAY smaller, then the first replacement, I</li>
      <li>Although the picture shows clips attached, and my first order had clips included, this current product does not have the clips.</li>

    <li> Great deal on CPAP supplies......fits perfectly......easy to clean and is more sturdy then one supplied with machine.....great value for CPAP users</li>
    <li> Used it befoe.&lt;br /&gt;It works for me</li>
    <li> If you need one of these, this one is the one to get.</li>
    <li> Terrible deal it did not come with the headgear clips...</li>
    <li> Great people and great product</li>
    <li> Buy two they get stretched out</li>
    <li> This went with the mask, and again, how much &amp;#34;like&amp;#34; is there for headgear, really? Glad they had it, sent it promptly, it works fine.</li>
    <li> ummmmmm no 31$ and no clips JUST THE STRAP my mistake for thinking they would actually not charge for clips, back it goes</li>
    <li> I feel cheated, I bought this item based on the photo which shows the clip on the ends to secure mask, however this clip does not come with the item.</li>
    <li> Clips not included!  If the headgear gets stretched and needs to be replaced, wouldnt you think the plastic clips need to be repalced as well?  For 50 cents more!!  Figure it out...please.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charge me a few bucks more, but dont annoy your customers....because we won&#x27;t be your customers again.</li>
    <li> Headgear was size regular and not medium as advertised. I had worn it about 3 days before I discovered it.</li>
    <li> Came with wrong mask. Fits horribly.</li>
    <li> excellent 100% recommended</li>
    <li> perfect replacement for my original.  Fits perfectly</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a little miffed here.  There is no such thing as a Mirage Quatrro FX.  There is a Mirage Quattro, and a Quattro FX.  This item is for the latter.  The seller is misleading buyers here.</li>
    <li> Had new velcro attachments and elastic band, it works much better than my old one because loose grip after 1 year of use.</li>
    <li> This headgear works as designed, but the straps come too close to my eyes.  I switched from a ResMed Quattro full face mask to the Quattro FX.  That was a mistake.</li>
    <li> The picture shows clips, but the description says they are not included, and they are definitely not included. It&#x27;s a standard ResMed headgear - guaranteed to stretch out and be useless in a couple months time, and crazy over priced for what it is. Would have rated this higher, but the 3 day shipping took more than a week to get to me.</li>
    <li> Comfortable but I still get air leaks.</li>
    <li> Way better than the Medium I originally received with the unit.  This was classified as &amp;#34;Standard&amp;#34;.  Way better fit.</li>
    <li> The ResMed Mirage Quattro FX Full Face Mask Headgear (Medium)  fits ResMed Quattro FX Full Face Mask Frame System-No Headgear (Medium) perfectly and keeps it on your head as I said before if something does what it&#x27;s supposed to do we as people are generally happy with said item</li>
    <li> These face mask headgear work very well. The only downside is that, for those of us who make a lot of adjustments, the wear quickly.</li>
    <li> I see a lot of complaints that the clips are not included with the headgear.  The clips come with the face mask, not the headgear.  It is very simple that when you remove the old headgear, save the clips, and put them on the new headgear.  It is no big deal, although I see a lot of complaints saying no clips.  If you get a new mask, the clips come with it.  The headgear lasts for several months while the clips and face mask will last longer.  The headgear does stretch over time, thus needing to be replaced.</li>
    <li> Very tight seems to be sized wrong</li>
    <li> Although the picture shows clips attached, and my first order had clips included, this current product does not have the clips. You have to order them separately. For this added expense and inconvenience, I am giving a low rating. Not as shown in description.</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with both the product &amp; service. Excellent company to do business with. Many thanks for everything</li>
    <li> The head gear was what i hoped for. It is important to pay attention to the letters in the description in order to order what you want.</li>
    <li> Worked w/ breathing machine &amp; mask perfectly ...</li>
    <li> fits great but no clips as in photo</li>
    <li> I have been using this headgear for years, size medium, and this is much, much too small. Is this a cheap knockoff?</li>
    <li> Sized WAY smaller, then the first replacement, I had!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO CLIPS were included. What a lame suppler. This is going back.</li>
    <li> This product fit the mask prefectly, is fully adjustable, easy to get on and off.  It does stretch out more than I think it should and needs readjusting about once a month.</li>
    <li> All you get is the head gear with no snaps, you need to take the ones off of the old head gear. It should have came with new connectors.</li>
    <li> Disappointed that it didn&#x27;t come with the clips, considering the picture shows the clips. Aside from that, the headgear is the same quality as my original ResMed headgear that lasted over 2 years.</li>
    <li> Great fit and arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> Required item if purchasing Quattro face mask. Came exactly as described and fit perfectly.</li>
    <li> I use this brand of headgear and in order for me to get a good seal, i have to have it so tight that it cuts the circulation off in my neck.  After a while the plastic velcro might get bent and it doesn&#x27;t stick properly because of it.  Over all a good product aside the fact that i had to make some cushion sleeves to go over the lower straps to stop the pain.</li>
    <li> Just like the original.  Fits perfectly, but since it&#x27;s not all stretched out like my old one, the velcro tabs are just past their loosest settings.  That means it&#x27;s got a lot of life to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, if I can just keep the cat from scratching it.</li>
    <li> Clips are apparently not provided. It is extremely misleading to promote this item with a visual representation that does not reflect the product in its entirety.</li>
    <li> The product is good at first then it wears down where the velcro strap wont stay on. No choice of other manufactures that I have seen.</li>
    <li> The product I received was defective. It stretched out almost immediately and the Velcro doesn&#x27;t hold causing my mask to shift and the straps to fall off during the night. I have contacted the manufacturer</li>
    <li> Great replacement, identical to original. It got here fast and it is so nice to have a strap where the Velcro works.</li>
    <li> I had some problems, primarily due to not ordering the right headgear for my mask. This company was great, they responded quickly and helped me out.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered keeps me alive</li>
    <li> This headgear did not seem to be the correct headgear for the ResMed Quattro. The fit on my head was quite different from the dozen or so previous headgears that I have used. The different way that it fit, caused some neck pain for the first month of using it. The head gear has stretched some and now a little more comfortable. But in the future I am going to buy my headgear from a local store where I can try on the fit before purchasing it.</li>
    <li> Deceptive selling practices . A healthcare product such as this should come with ALL PARTS INCLUDED. It is not unreasonable to expect a head strap to a CPAP mask comes with it clips. Health Store And More has decided to sell the unit as not fully operational unless you spend an additional ten dollars for clips. THIS SHOULD BE CLEARLY LISTED IN ITEM DESCRIPTION . Its poor rating will continue to be so until they respect they&#x27;re customer base.</li>
    <li> Awesome , and truly made by RESMED !!!</li>
    <li> As noted, this headgear was slightly different in design than my former ResMed Quatro headgear.  Not sure if this reflects a factory design issue or just another vendor selling to ResMed.  Headgear works well, rides in a slightly different place on my head, aleviating a sore back of neck issue I was getting from my former headgear.  Good price and it works!</li>
    <li> Does not include the plastic clips depicted in the photo. You will need to order the clips as a separate item.</li>
    <li> The picture and write up indicated this item was just like the one I purchased from ResMed; however, no clips were included with the delivery and the item is a much lesser grade of thinner material with very short velcro tabs compared with the standard item.  Overall, a cheap knock off that is no way comparable to the original - very disappointed and will not order again.</li>
    <li> I had my doubts about the design but it fits perfect with the mask and is comfortable to sleep at night</li>
    <li> Ir worked perfectly with my new cushion. My old one was in bad shape and now I can sleep better.</li>
    <li> nice replacement for my old one that had the velcrow wear out.  I would buy this again if needed.</li>
    <li> It works with the mask... not sure what else needs to be said.</li>
    <li> it was advertized incorrectly  it must&#x27;ve been a child&#x27;s size because it was about 3 sizes too small</li>
    <li> The description should say \\&quot;Clips not included\\&quot;. Yes, I could have found that out if I had read more reviews, but I don&#x27;t think I was unreasonable to assume that the clips were included, since the product is useless without them. The product photo even shows clips attached, which is deceptive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit - the product photo now appears without clips, but they were showing when I ordered, and the photo on my order history still shows the clips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit #2 - after I contacted the seller, they sent me the missing clips and threw in a free cushion. Very good customer service! They explained that they do not control the picture. My advice: ask the seller whether clips are included, before ordering. You can&#x27;t tell for sure from the picture or the description.</li>
    <li> I love the facemask but Resmed needs to seriously consider changes to the headgear. The upper straps fit right across the ears and causes cuts in them. It needs to be re-designed so that they fit higher on a persons head. I even have some soft cloth wrapped around the strap but it doesn&#x27;t help much. And a larger size just fits too loose.</li>
    <li> Initially this headgear fits okay.  After a few weeks of use, it stretches and comes loose at night.  It seems to work only if it flips my ears down.  The straps are narrower than I prefer making it difficult to get good contact.  The Velcro does not seem to hold well.  Too bad because I like the mask.</li>
    <li> Purchased here from CPAP Deals.  Headgear works and fits great.  HOWEVER it came WITHOUT the clips.</li>
    <li> Its a very small med,,  Its like the sizes are shrinking.  Had a medium and worked fine this was way tooo small. Changing to a large I guess.  its very rigid,  broke the face mask, strapping this in.</li>
    <li> Was too small for my head.  I returned it, ordered the large and the fit was perfect.  Nothing wrong with the product, only size.</li>
    <li> Excellent replacement parts for my CPAP.  Great price.</li>
    <li> excellent product that met all requirements</li>
    <li> Headgear seems to be a good replacement for the original. A couple of things left me feeling less than good about this purchase. First, the straps are screen printed all over with the words &amp;#34;Sleep lab mask not for sale.&amp;#34; The one I received was obviously one of the freebies that Resmed sent out to a sleep center for use during sleep lab. The headgear wasn&#x27;t even in an original ResMed bag, but some generic clear bag, leaving it unclear if this was new or used.</li>
    <li> It has the ResMed logo on it and the seller assured me that it wasn&#x27;t a knock-off, but it sure looks like a knock-off to me. It&#x27;s thin and cheaply made, not at all like my headgear that originally came with my mask.&lt;br /&gt;But the good side is that it fits well enough for me to use for now.&lt;br /&gt;I will certainly be more careful what I buy in the future.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement and fit</li>
    <li> My husband uses a CPAP at night, we needed to replace his existing headgear so we bought this one, that matched the one he had....even thou we bought the same size, it said Medium, the one we got is much smaller than the one he had, it didn´t fit him at all.... so I can´t say it was good.</li>
    <li> Okay, the photo shows clips. The page says it comes with clips. WHERE ARE THE CLIPS?  Go item, quick delivery but missing clips.</li>
    <li> This headgear is not what I expected. I ordered a facemask kit that came with a much higher quality headgear than this one. It is definitely not worth the price paid.</li>
    <li> Be very careful this fits your ResMed Mirage Quattro  Full Face Mask. I found out the ResMed changed the design and this does not fit the older (Non FX) model. It states it here on the 2nd page but I didn&#x27;t scroll down that far.&lt;br /&gt;Return was at my expense.</li>
    <li> works great with new mask</li>
    <li> the straps are pretty decent and pretty expensive</li>
    <li> Excellent product better than the headgear that comes with the equipment</li>
    <li> Poor quality, it ruins in a little time and becomes loose. But it is the only you can buy. I think I will find a solution by myself to prolong its life, it costs a lot of money!</li>
    <li> Absolutely Wonderful!!!! fits better and stays in place better than any other mask and headgear I have ever used!!!!</li>
    <li> The picture shows the clips attached to this but they were not included so I have make another order which means more shipping cost.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t like the mask, headgear allows it to slide down</li>
    <li> The poduct works good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to use up 14 more words before I can submit this silly review. Done</li>
    <li> very durable fits my mask perfect durable and cheap</li>
    <li> Just what I needed.  Been over a year since i had a new one. Felt a little tighter that I thought it should. Probably because I was use to tje loose one.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I need for my bi pap.</li>
    <li> When I ordered I wasn&#x27;t completely sure it was the correct harness for my mask but it was and I am thrilled....Thanks</li>
    <li> This head gear is all that said to be.</li>
    <li> Much better fit now that I&#x27;ve replaced my stretched out mask. Just prepare to reuse your plastic clips from your previous headgear.</li>
    <li> I replaced my streched out headgear with this one and it works as stated. Could be a lot less for what it really is.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase, as it turned out to be every thing that it should have been. I saved a lot of money purchasing this item here &amp; recommend it&#x27;s purchase.</li>
    <li> Good price, no longer have insurance that covers this product so it was nice to find this at a reasonable price. Works well with my equipment.</li>
    <li> These work fairly well for a WHILE but then stretch out. I worked on my old one and put a cross strap on it when it finally lost its elasticity, but surely there is something better. If you know of anything please comment below--I am still searching for the perfect mask for my biPap machine and hate having the fart noises in the middle of the night when the pressure blows it off my face and wakes the wife. And YES, its the MASK..not anything else including barking spiders...</li>
    <li> this is an important aprt of my ResMed CPAP system, which I use every night since it was prescribed 3 months ago.</li>
    <li> These do not last very long and the one that came with this order is defective. I did not take the time to send it back because I needed it immediately. The one delivered has defective velcro on one of the straps and it kept coming apart and waking me during the night so I sewed it in place...but the straps stretch over time requiring regular adjustment.&lt;br /&gt;I need to order these between supplies which come from Medicare because they will only supply 2 a year and 3 months is maximum life if used every night.</li>
    <li> fast delivery, very happy.</li>
    <li> Fits well, but velcro wears out really fast. Much less expensive than through my medical provider.</li>
