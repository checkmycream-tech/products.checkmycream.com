<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I loved this product.</li>
    <li> I have found that this stuff works a lot better than It&#x27;s A 10&lt;br /&gt;I have thick hair that is kinky curly in places and curly/wavy in other places. So I straighten and blow dry a lot; this is a great protector and keeps the frizz down when I let my hair air-dry.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use it daily. I also use Matrix Total Results Pro Solutionist Total Treat Deep Cream Mask once a week and my hair has never been healthier looking. I can&#x27;t recommend these products enough!</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!! I got a sample of it from my hair girl after I did my normal blonde highlights. My hair is always pretty dry in the spots that were highlighted. This stuff got the brittleness under control quickly. I had been looking for all kinds of deep conditioners and nothing was working. I tried a lot of those oils you leave in over night. This is what you want to be using. It&#x27;s not oil and going to soak in your pillow and then into your face overnight. I can spray in spots that are dryer. I can spray it at anytime and usually spray a couple times before bed because why not. and it smells FABULOUS! Sometimes I want to spray it just for the smell. I would definitely buy some more of this stuff. I already bought 2 bottles. :D</li>
    <li> Amazing product. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 years after having severe damage from multiple dye jobs. It SAVED and restored my hair! I use it after every wash as a leave in conditioner and detangler. It worked to dramatically change the texture and rejuvenate and moisturize my hair.</li>
    <li> This product works well in your hair and makes it soft. I would tell all my friends about it. I like it because I have thick hair and the product makes it managable.</li>
    <li> I have very thick and wavy hair.  It seems to grow &amp;#34;out&amp;#34; vs. &amp;#34;long&amp;#34; so it&#x27;s regularly &amp;#34;poofy&amp;#34;.  This really helps smooth it down.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and I have been getting regular keratin treatments for years.  With my lack of finances lately I had to cut back.  This product really does the trick! Makes me hair very soft and manageable...  smells really good too.</li>
    <li> Great for leave in conditioning for my color treated hair and for detangling my curly headed kids.</li>
    <li> This will make your hair have a softer feel and will help with any frizzies.  It also has a nice smell and is not at all greasy.  Will make your hair feel silkier and more moist.  Its great.</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF makes your hair feel brand new. It replenishes my curls after I shower. My hair looks and feels healthier. I put this stuff in my hair from the base of head and down. I use this product along with Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Awaphui Hydrocream Whip with Wild Ginger (recommend). Makes my curls (loose spiral type/ wavy curls) hydrated and healthy and hold in place. Love! Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Just received it and loving it already. After showering, I apply it to my damp hair and blow dry. Smells good too!</li>
    <li> I have very dry hair that no matter what I have tried in the past, I still had frizz, fly-aways and ragged ends.  I received a sample of this in the mail and was immediately hooked.  After just one use, my hair was soft, shiny, and no more fly-aways, even on the coldest days.  I now have the hair I have always wanted, and the results last for 2-3 days in between washes.  Although it is a bit pricey, it is definitely worth it.  You only need a small amount (3-4 spritzes for medium/long hair).  I would highly recommend!!!  Holy grail product---finally!!</li>
    <li> I have really damaged hair and this works magic!</li>
    <li> Using this with the shampoo and conditioner has help my hair. My hair use to be dry and unmanageable and now I can do more with it.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It helps with softness and combing through my wet hair after washing. I won&#x27;t ever go without it! Really helps if you highlight or dye your hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product, especially with winter weather.. would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I love this product . It makes my hair look and feel much better I have bought this twice and will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product. I have long, fine hair and I use this as a leave in conditioner.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, and I do notice it feels much thicker and softer when I use it. It also helps to keep my hair from getting tangled as much as it normally does. A little goes a long way with this product, and it is definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair soft to the touch as soon as applied. It hydrated my hair. I chose standard shipping I received it within 4 days !</li>
    <li> This stuff is simply amazing.  It really tames frizz without being heavy. And it smells really nice.  I have actually been using it in lieu of the famous brand argan oil ( in the blue box - you know which one I mean).  I highly HIGHLY recommend this.  I keep one in the car so that I can tame the salty locks after surfing, one in my classroom for emergency bad hair days, a small bottle in my travel kit, and of course one at home.  Matrix has already made a lot of money on me!!</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair very soft and tangle free</li>
    <li> 3.5 Stars.  It works well.  The hair tends to be smooth, a bit flat after usage, but if I curl it, it might be better.  What I dislike is the heavy scent.  It&#x27;s not unpleasant, just too heavy.  It does evaporate a lot, but what&#x27;s the point of such a strong scent for the user?</li>
    <li> AWESOME!! I love this product. One of the best leave in conditioners I have ever used. I know it is not cheap however worth every penny and smells like heaven.</li>
    <li> Love this product ,really enhances my Keratin treated hair</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I received a sample from ULTA an used it, liked it, then ordered it. The most important thing for me, is that this stuff makes your hair soft as hell, soft enough where people freak out and say: how? I mean it&#x27;s probably because I take good care of my hair, but either way, my friend from Hawaii came to visit and loved it too. Ideally, it&#x27;s just a really nice finisher. Gives a little volume, softness, and feel like it conditions hair.</li>
    <li> I use this every time I wash my hair. It&#x27;s great for detangling, leaves my hair soft and smelling nice.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist recommended this product to me for my very fine and dry hair. It&#x27;s a great product thus far. The scent is very mild and it does not weight my fine hair down. Although its like a lotion it goes onto the hair clear and there is no evidence that there is a product in your hair.</li>
    <li> Smells great &amp; detangles my hair just right.  I don&#x27;t have thick hair but it tangles without conditioning.  Spray in after washing and brush slides through hair with no pain.</li>
    <li> This product was used by my hairdresser to smooth wiry gray hairs. I would have bought it from her, but she was out and said it was hard to get it from her supplier. So I did what I do--shopped Amazon. Arrived quickly and the product is doing what I expected.</li>
    <li> If you have some frizzes in your hair, this will help. It makes your hair very soft and more managable and it smells nice.  When you put it on your hands, it feels very slippery, but not greasy.  It seems to work really well and I will probably buy some more.  My sister gave me a sample to try before I bought more, and she liked it also.</li>
    <li> Hard to find, great product!!  Does not leave your hair feeling greasy or weigh it down.  Smells great!</li>
    <li> I have frizzy, wavy/curly hair that is coarse to the touch.  I have tried so many different products, and none of them have lived up to the hype.  They all seemed to leave my hair dull and dirty looking, or crunchy.  This leave-in makes my hair soft, shiny, and almost frizz-free (I have yet to find a product that completely gets rid of frizz).  I also love the scent.  It&#x27;s a little on the pricey side, but a little goes a long way and it&#x27;s totally worth the price to me.</li>
    <li> I use this after washing and towel drying (conditioner used in shower also).  I have color treated hair that I use a straight iron on daily.  This makes me hair feel smoother and softer with daily use.  I like that it&#x27;s a spray and you can see through the bottle to see how much is left.  I also love the smell.  I&#x27;m hooked on it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Matrix products, You can buy This stuff with your eyes closed, because Biolage nourishes and smooths overprocess hair without leaving it greasy adding shine. This spray smells great, why the bottle is so small??? Anyways, i only have 2 weeks using it and so far is great. It got delayed in shipping but is fine.</li>
    <li> As a leave in conditioner and to re&lt;br /&gt;style my hair makes hair feel healthy &amp; manageable. Smells good too!</li>
    <li> Finally a product that does what it claims to.  Great shot of Keratin in one pump.  My daughters hair is a tangled mess and this is the only product that works.</li>
    <li> Like my other review on the Paul Mitchell product. High price and no noticeable change using this product over time. I have tried numerous Keratin products and not found they fulfill any of the claims they make. I also notice that many of these products by other manufacturers seem to be on clearance, wonder if this is related.</li>
    <li> This truly works!  Trust and believe all the five-star reviews listed here -- I have long (mid-back) curly hair that is tough to comb out after a shower and three pumps covers everything and makes it a breeze to comb.  It leaves your hair super soft, even with horribly hard water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MAJOR CAUTION: Long term use keratin treatments seals your hair so completely that color treatments don&#x27;t work properly.  I treat myself to coloring at spendy salons and got &amp;#34;hot roots&amp;#34; twice after using this spray for 8 months before a stylist told me that this is an unfortunate side effect of long-term keratin use.  In order to continue to color my golden brown hair a more neutral brown, I have had to switch back to using Moroccan oil products and haven&#x27;t had hot roots since.</li>
    <li> It made the hair little smoother. But I expected to be even more smoother and more manageable hair. You can give a try and see.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!!! My hair was starting to get dried out and ends were splitting. Used this for about a month or so daily and totally repaired my hair. Love it!</li>
    <li> Best stuff I have ever used. And I&#x27;ve tried a lot.</li>
    <li> Mt daughter loves this she has very long hair this keeps it manageable and she is not fussing with it to much</li>
    <li> This is the best product by far for my hair. My hair has highlights, which tend to dry out my hair. I bought the shampoo, conditioner and the leave in spray, worried the spray would leave my hair oily but it doesn&#x27;t, it leaves a nice soft shine, smells great, hair is looking healthier and when I dry my hair with a round brush the curls are soft and full of volume.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I have fine, natural curly hair and I have been looking for a product that didn&#x27;t leave my hair crunchy and wet looking. It doesn&#x27;t say anything about using it on curly hair,  but I do and I absolutely love it. It&#x27;s almost time to buy so more! I bought a bottle for my daughter also, and she loves using it also. The salon that I purchased from through Amazon was awesome! I ordered Thursday afternoon and received it Monday. I would highly recommend this product...curly head or not!</li>
    <li> Smells pretty...but beware if you have allergies because on my allergy days it made me sneeze a lot! It has a strong scent. It untangles hair perfectly and makes it very shiny and smooth.</li>
    <li> This is fabulous.  I am hooked.</li>
    <li> I received a 1oz. bottle of the Matrix Keratin Dose Pro-Keratin Renewal from my hairdresser as a sample after a haircut.  After years of bleaching my hair to the point of platinum blonde, and then moving to an area with very hard water...my hair was beginning to look pretty damaged.  I let this sample bottle sit in my bathroom cabinet for almost a year.  Then one day, after looking in the mirror at hair that was beginning to frizz for the first time in my lifetimes, I pulled that little bottle out.  What a lifesaver!  The change was IMMEDIATE!  I have received so many compliments on the quality of my hair since using this product.  Now, every night after getting out of the shower, I spray this in my hair, and my preschool-age daughter&#x27;s hair as well.  We have very fine hair, and have always had problems with tangling.  I&#x27;ve tried everything on her hair, and yet every time I took a brush to her head, we struggled.  After spraying this product sparingly on her hair, I have no problem getting a brush through it, and we no longer have to fight over whether to leave her hair looking like a wildchild or not.  Thank you for Matrix for no more rat&#x27;s nests in my beautiful princesses&#x27; hair!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product with the whole line of keratindose!  In love! Amazing Product! Try it you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I hate this product - I used to use the Fortifying spray this was supposed to be a replacement.  It leaves my hair dull and flyaway.  Worst at the end of the day it feels dry and damaged.  I used 3x and tossed.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I love this product, its keeps your hair so soft and smells great. I would recommend this product for anyone. No matter if you have curls or straight hair.</li>
    <li> life changing. dramatic? okay fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw another reviewer post how great this stuff was &amp; thought I&#x27;d give it a go. It&#x27;s true. Starts working on day 1. The ends of my hair have been dry &amp; frizzy no matter what conditioner I put in or how many times i coated the ends in olive oil before bed. This stuff? Day 1, spray on hair after showering, comb through. that&#x27;s it. My hair was not dry &amp; frizzy at the ends all day. It keeps getting better the more I use it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it&#x27;s pricey. Is it worth it? YES.</li>
    <li> I have chemically damaged hair, and this is a dream product. I have been a fan of biolage for a long time. I am very thankful for their scientists!! Thank you biolage!!</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for. And it came exactly as it said it would. Just perfect, need to order more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a natural brunette who bleaches up to white hair and let me tell you, this product is by far the best I have used in restoring my hair to its natural feel.  I originally received a sample of this from Ulta but have continued buying it because it is so fantastic.  It has a fresh floral scent that is very reminiscent of what my hair smells like fresh from the salon.</li>
    <li> Fabulous product. My hair has never felt so silky. Acts as  a tamer also. I will keep ordering this product.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist used this on me when I was there last.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey but I don&#x27;t think much is needed for it to work very well.  I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff in the world for dry or damaged hair and it smells so good. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Helps control the frizzies really well in humid Florida!</li>
    <li> This Keratin products work is amazing. I use it on wet hair and then blow dry it, I definitely noticed the difference and so did my friends.</li>
    <li> Great smell and softens my hair!</li>
    <li> This Leave-in Spray is not cheap, but it is wonderful.  I have very long hair that I never completely blow dry.  If I use this spray, my hair looks smooth and groomed, even if I let it air dry,  The texture is nice, and my hair never feels greasy.  This is that rare product that performs exactly as it promises.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference after over a months. It does make my hair dull when I use it.</li>
    <li> I have 3c/4a natural hair.  My hair lightens on its own in the sun and dries out quickly if I leave my ends exposed.  To retain moisture, I use the LOC method after a wash.  If you are not familiar with terms in the natural hair community, LOC &#x3D; Liquid/Leave-In, Oil, Cream.  Depending on the weather, sometimes the LOC method isn&#x27;t enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided by Ulta as a free sample.  During my transition, I didn&#x27;t notice any results on my relaxed hair and stopped using it.  After mistaking it several months later for my small bottle of conditioner which I intended to apply to dry hair, I discovered that my natural hair loves it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though this product is a leave-in, I use it last.  It&#x27;s protein-rich formula is meant to seal your cuticles, so I want it to seal my other products in, as opposed to blocking them out.  The smell doesn&#x27;t rock my world, but I love that my hair feels soft and silky.  I still get frizz, but that&#x27;s because I have multiple hair textures to deal with.  I use this product on any style where I leave my ends exposed, and my ends do not get crunchy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This week, I received the ultimate compliment when a lady asked me how my hair is so shiny and moisturized when other&#x27;s afros look dry.  Thank you, Matrix Keratin Dose!</li>
    <li> Quite possibly the best hair keratin spray that dmells terrific out there. I use it every day and so does my family.</li>
    <li> BEST. PRODUCT. EVER! Okay, seriously. No. SERIOUSLY. You have no idea how much $$$$ I have spent on creams, serums, sprays, etc. Kerastasse? Yeah. Tried it. Paul Mitchell? Tried that too. But THIS spray, holy cow is it incredible. It smells great, is easy to apply. I&#x27;ve got curly/wavy hair that&#x27;s really brittle no matter what. Always a poof. I just dyed it and it looked as dry as straw. My ends? Disastrous. Then, the heavens opened up, a light shined down on my nappy head, and BOOM! This product appeared. I usually spray 8-10 on the bottom of my hair (don&#x27;t believe that 3-4 sprays stuff, 8-10+ is TOTALLY the way to go!) I spray maybe like 3-4 on the top of my head. Brush with the Tangle Teaser, (LADIES: if you&#x27;ve got curly hair, seriously get that brush!) and VOILA! My hair has never, ever gotten as many compliments as it has with this product. I have used almost everything Matrix Biolage puts out, but this the real deal. Hope this helps! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I didn&#x27;t buy this on Amazon, btw, although I really should have! I will next time!)</li>
    <li> Noticeable difference after just one use!!! My hair is color treated, and I use a blowdryer and flat iron every day.  This left my dry coarse hair soft and very manageable. This smells great and does not have a sticky feel. I don&#x27;t know how I ever got by without this!!  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have dry hair and it&#x27;s always been a pain to moisture my hair without weighing it down---aka hair sticking to my head, flat horribleness. This was recommended to hold in the moisture after showers and it works great. Especially after summer activities like the beach. Also works as a detangler as it moisturizes.</li>
    <li> I was given a free sample of this hair renewal &amp; I absolutely love it.  I work out in a pool, my hair is sometimes underwater for almost an hour, I use this after swimming &amp; it really keeps my natural curly hair frizz free &amp; very easy to work with.</li>
    <li> smells so good! and helps repair hair!</li>
    <li> I use this as a detangler and leave in conditioner after the shower.  It detangles very well and smells nice.  I have long hair so I use around 8 sprays.  I have not necessarily noticed that the texture of my hair is vastly different ... but that could be that I have been using this so long that I don&#x27;t remember how it was before.  I wasn&#x27;t excited about the price but it is worth it for a large bottle that has lasted me well over six months and still has plenty left.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I use with the shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have baby fine blonde hair. So far I notice shinier, thicker hair. It truly makes my hair feel soft. No more brittle hair!</li>
    <li> Makes my hair silky smooth and I have curly hair.  It doesn&#x27;t get rid of the curls it just makes them easier to manage.  Less tangles.  Has a pleasant smell.  I have been using for about a year.  My hair dresser recommended this product.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product after reading so many excellent reviews about this product. Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t turn out excellent for me. My hair is very silky and straight. , I had had it highlighted and there was a little damage to it, Which is the normal damage associated with highlighting. After ordering this product I realized that it is not meant for blow drying. Most probably it is for straight ironing the hair. I even tried this product on my son and my mother-in-law&#x27;s hair. But they didn&#x27;t like it either. One has slightly dry straight hair and the other  had wavy coarse hair. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be ordering this product again, as I might end up giving this particular bottle to a friend.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair silky and smelling great.</li>
    <li> I have natural curls that have a mind of their own.  I have tried sooooo many products for curls, but one leaves my hair crisp, one weights it down and another, I can not get a brush through  once it dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have been using this for 6 months and I love it!  It leaves my curls natural, ringlets and soft!</li>
    <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ll use for a &#x27;leave-in&#x27; spray.</li>
    <li> My daughters curly tangles are no match for this stuff!! Works and smells fantastic!</li>
    <li> This spray works great on my dry bushy wavy hair! I over colored my hair and needed this spray to relax, moisturize, add shine and soften my hair and it did right away. I use it on my wet clean hair and in between shampoos to soften and detangle. I will buy it again!</li>
    <li> Great product for your hair.</li>
    <li> I am transitioning out of a relaxer. I first got this spray as a sample from JCPenney and BOY I used this stuff up! I used mine and I took my mom&#x27;s and I&#x27;m about to take my sister&#x27;s. After I run out of that I AM gonna buy the 6.7oz. Where my new growth and relaxer meet is the most fragile part of my hair, and I use this spray to keep that part strong and moisturized. I don&#x27;t think I can go without this!</li>
    <li> I have fine hair that easily gets weighed down by many conditioners.  This stuff is very good.  It gives me moisture without weight.  My hair looks healthier with much less frizz.  Will purchase again.  It&#x27;s better than Its a Ten spray or any drugstore brands of leave-ins that I have tried so far</li>
    <li> I dye my hair monthly, so it&#x27;s quick to frizz. This product, matched with Biolage Hydrating Shampoo and Conditioning Balm, leaves my hair gorgeous, like virgin hair. Just don&#x27;t use it near your roots or your hair could appear greasy.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! One bottle lasts me forever and this is the best price I&#x27;ve found for it!</li>
    <li> Hair is so soft &amp; shiny after using this product.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel soft and smooth after blowdrying!</li>
    <li> It only shot out one little stream and was too oily. Was going to be writing and asking for a refund.</li>
    <li> Can not say enough about this leave-in treatment. It makes my thick course hair shiny and soft but not greasy. Each time I used it people complimented how healthy it looks and asked me what I was doing different. I am 55 and have color treated hair so that&#x27;s saying a lot. Also had my daughter us it who has to take a time seizure medicine. These medicines leave her thick hair dull and extremely dry. She is prone to awful neck knots no matter what she used. But this treatment brought back the life and shine to her hair. And no more neck knots.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing! Have used it for a long time now! I get compliments on my hair, and how healthy it looks!</li>
    <li> perfect for my daughters curly hair</li>
    <li> I really like this product! Its good but when I run out I&#x27;ll probably get something better suitable for my hair.</li>
    <li> Great product. I can get this bought and shipped to me from here for less than buying at an Ulta store.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several conditioning products including the leave-in spray by Biolage. I prefer this hands down. I have wavy hair that is shoulder length and easily tangled. This takes care of the tangling, and I&#x27;ve noticed a decrease in frizziness as well. Also, it&#x27;s not too heavy on my hair.</li>
    <li> Super.shin condition and clean scent.worked well ok n my curly hair that is blowed dry flat ironed. A little pricey but great product.last pretty long when washing every other day.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Shipped fast.</li>
    <li> About a year ago, this hairdresser fried my hair while highlighting it.  Since then, I have had to use this product with their keratin  shampoo and conditioner to make the fried frizz less noticeable.  I went through tons of products and fancy conditioners and avocado and egg mixtures and this is the only thing that helps.  Does it completely fix my Brillo pad fried hair?  No, but it makes it more manageable.</li>
