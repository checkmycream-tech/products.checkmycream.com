<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this product. But although it states that it is not tested on animals, I need to see the bunny. So I will probably not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love this option to keep my skin matte when I have makeup on. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT</li>
    <li> My favorite by far.  Goes on smooth and lasts all day.</li>
    <li> It works to prevent sunburn, and the color was OK when blended, but the greasy factor is overwhelming. It is like applying vaseline, and does not wash off. I had to use my face wash 3 x! Too expensive to toss out, but I just did!</li>
    <li> This product blends well over my moisturizer and has an SPF. i find the color rubs right in in different times of the year when my skin may be a bit darker or lighter depending on the season.</li>
    <li> Goes on really smooth. Love that it protects my skin from the sun!</li>
    <li> I have very fair skin, so I was worried about the tint, but this worked well on myself and several others who have much darker and fairer skin than mine. It&#x27;s silky going on and is almost like a foundation with a matte finish, which is a nice change from greasy sunscreens. Only cons are that it isn&#x27;t terribly waterproof (but I spend a lot of time in salt water) and it will stain the inside of a hat or other clothes that it comes in contact with. Used it on my face every day for 2 1/2 weeks and only used about 1/4 of the tube, so it ends up being a great value.</li>
    <li> See my review there! Perfect for oily, sweaty, sensitive skin. Perfect makeup primer, too! Lasts all day with zero creasing or whitish cast!</li>
    <li> So many things I love about this product. It&#x27;s free of preservatives and chemicals.  It applies easily on my face. With other sunscreens, sometimes it&#x27;s hard to apply evenly and it doesn&#x27;t spread easily (like Shiseido: http://goo.gl/SiyEkx).  Additionally, I like the finish and tint.  On days when I don&#x27;t want to bother with makeup, it helps cover up my face.</li>
    <li> I can practically use this as foundation, and in the summer I often do. It has a nice silky feel and just enough tint to even out my skin. I feel more protected with this product than with a spf-added moisturizer or foundation.</li>
    <li> I seriously love this sunblock. I have fair skin that burns easily and I really should be wearing sunblock on my face everyday - but I really was so bad about it. I don&#x27;t want to use chemical sunblock on my face everyday and most products just added a layer that felt gross, smelled bad, or left my face like an oil slick. Then I tried a sample of this stuck on a page in a magazine and I was so thrilled. It is a mineral sunblock, has no smell, and has a fantastic almost mousse-like texture that goes on like a primer. And it has a natural color tint to it that looks dark when you squeeze it out of the tube but actually is very sheer and blended right in to my fair skin. It filled in my fine lines and pores enough that I thought my skin looked better with it on. A little bit of brightening concealer and I could skip my sheer foundation! Finally a product that gets me excited about wearing a good SPF. Will recommend this one!</li>
    <li> Goes on smoothly and good coversge</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen! Feels silky and weightless on, and the slight tint isn&#x27;t overly pigmented, even on my fair skin. Since it&#x27;s a physical barrier instead of a chemical one, it doesn&#x27;t burn when in the sunlight. I haven&#x27;t tested it beyond splashing around in a kiddie pool and sweating on some hikes, but I&#x27;ve been pleased with its performance so far.</li>
    <li> Best suntan lotion  iv ever found</li>
    <li> Over the years I have tried numerous products to protect my face from the sun. Because I am outside a lot during hot weather and seldom just relaxing, I need a product that gives great protection and doesn&#x27;t sweat off the minute the temps get high.&lt;br /&gt;Some products give me a good SPF but don&#x27;t stay on - I can usually tell as soon as it runs into my eyes which sends me to the nearest sink for a face wash.&lt;br /&gt;The advantages of this one product makes it worth using&lt;br /&gt;no irritation to my skin or eyes&lt;br /&gt;virtually no scent&lt;br /&gt;is skin tone colored so it actually covers skin color imperfections so you don&#x27;t have to layer makeup over it&lt;br /&gt;goes on matte and stays matte no matter how much you sweat&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t block my pores and create breakouts&lt;br /&gt;SPH is high enough that I still haven&#x27;t experienced any skin burning and we have had some really warm days already this year&lt;br /&gt;and my favorite reason : once you put it on you forget it&#x27;s even there - no sticky feeling AT ALL!&lt;br /&gt;I feel like I&#x27;m ready for summer this time!</li>
    <li> Great on its own and as a makeup primer, looks invisible and has spf 40.  Im allergic to chemical sunscreens and this is the best chem free one I have found that works awesome under makeup preventing creasing as well as helps control oil.  You can&#x27;t even tell you have it on when you put it on.  Also I have never broken out from it, I often do with many other products even if they say they are oil free.  But this one has not caused any problems !</li>
    <li> I have nothing good to say about this product. AT ALL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It made my face smell disgusting. Im not talking about the normal sunscreeny smell thats expected. Nope, this made my face smell dirty all day. I  I tried using it a couple more times, but each time was the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing special about this product and the high reviews baffle me. Dr. Denese makes a much better face sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this in person at a beauty outlet, but it&#x27;s cheaper here even with free 2-day Prime delivery. I have very fair and oily skin. When I first apply this, I definitely detect a tint, which I simply blend into my face until it is even. Within minutes, the color mellows to a neutral tone that matches my skin, while evening out smaller imperfections, and protecting from sun. It actually creates a lovely glow! This is my favorite sunscreen for the face for daily use, though, for longer exposures, I always rely on a hat, or avoid peak sun altogether if possible. I have reviewed another sunscreen here that I like, but this one just provides better coverage and SPF (UVA, protection, too.) One tube lasts me several months; I only apply it to my face, and probably should apply more. Elsewhere on my ears, neck, and body, I can use a different sunscreen that isn&#x27;t mattifying and tinted (and cheaper). I prefer the mineral sunscreens for protection, as they don&#x27;t tend to run into my eyes and cause stinging, and I think they&#x27;re better at protecting against sun damage than the chemical sunscreens. That said, untinted zinc/titanium sunscreens are so whitening, that they make my not-perfectly-white teeth look unacceptably yellow. This sunscreen solves that problem with the tint. Don&#x27;t be put off by the color in the tube--it really goes on much lighter than expected, and blends quickly. If it weren&#x27;t for the fact that I NEED a mattifier every day, I probably wouldn&#x27;t bother with sunscreen, to my detriment. I get both needs covered with this product. It&#x27;s really excellent--keeps my face less shiny, and bangs less stringy.</li>
    <li> Love it, slight tint and good spf</li>
    <li> Very good product. Goes on smoothly and gives a great matte look on the face. Apply only a small amount as not much is needed to cover the entire face area. Feels light and weightless and is not greasy. I always use it underneath my tinted primer and, as the sunscreen is already tinted, I sometimes use it instead of my primer product as it provides my skin with the glow it needs to make me look radiant during the day. Would highly recommend this product to my friends!</li>
    <li> Most products like this usually are too greasy and you end up with a shine all over looking very strange, but I did like this product and the consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though as a tester I didn&#x27;t get my \\&quot;skin color\\&quot; my daughter was slightly lighter and was able to effectively use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend.</li>
    <li> Was hoping for some coverage after seeing the skin tone color. Looks dark coming out of the tube. I guess I was expecting a miracle product but this goes on sheer as it says on the bottle. I think it may be better for the fairest of the fair-skinned. Other than that, it seems moisturizing and glides on the skin. Good SPF.  A bit expensive for small tube.</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;It was recommended by my doctor. I have been using it since last year. I interchange between Cotz and EltaMD. I like both of them.</li>
    <li> I thought I was going to be receiving a tinted moisturizer.  When I opened the package and saw how tiny the tub was, I was dismayed.  Then when I saw how dark it was, I thought i was going to have to throw it out.  But a little goes a very long way!  I was able to blend it in to my fair skin -- it adds just enough coverage and really does seem to protect me from the sun.  It feels lovely on my skin, very light and silky.  It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best color tinted sun screen.  It does not irritate my very sensitive skin or eyes and goes on with a matte finish so my face does not look shiny and it lasts the whole day.</li>
    <li> This is the best sunscreen I have ever purchased for my face.  It keeps my face matte all day and it is very natural and keeps me pretty.  I am very pleased and happy with this product.  The tint might be too dark if you are pale (ivory) or light.  But the tint is perfect for me and blends with my skin and evens out the tone just perfectly.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use these sort of things that much but I have been using this for the past week and I must say I&#x27;m impressed.  The lotion goes on smoothly and is tan in color so it helps make up go on well over it.  I&#x27;m getting older so I finally decided to listen to mom and use and SPF make up or actually using sunblock under my makeup.  I like the fact that this isn&#x27;t greasy or oily at all.  So far so good!  No red cheeks or nose after being outside in the bright sunlight for hours!</li>
    <li> Cotz Face Natural Skin Tone works great as a sunscreen. You do not see the color on your skin, but it makes skin look more perfected. It does look a bit dark in the tube, but when you apply it, it just blends away flawlessly. I am very fair skinned, so I was worried that it would be too dark, but I did not have an issue at all. It does not sweat off or streak and it does wash off easily if need be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on so smoothly. It does not stay tacky, moist or sticky on the skin. It is just a very smooth matte feel. It is very lightweight. I hate caking on foundation etc...cannot stand the feeling of all that \\&quot;crap\\&quot; on my face, but Cotz is very lightweight and I do not mind it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It provided excellent protection from the sun for me. I have melasma - pigmentation up the center of my forehead, across the top of my eye brows, and across my upper lip. I try every sunscreen out there, as it seems to get worse no matter what sunscreen I use. It is almost as if those areas are immune to sunscreen. There are about 4 products that I have found over the past several years that actually seem to work to some degree as far as protecting the areas from getting darker. Cotz is one of the products that actually work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my case, I do not mind the price if it actually works because I want to stop these hyperpigmented areas of my face from getting any darker. Others, who just want basic sun protection may not like the cost for such a small tube. I will say that I think the tube should last a good bit of time - you do not need a whole lot for each application - a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend Cotz Natural Skin Tone because it feels great on the skin, makes skin look perfected without looking like you have any makeup on, and it provides excellent protection from the sun. Great stuff here!</li>
    <li> I have used a similar product, Supernatural by philosophy for a while now so I was interested to try this cream to see how the two compare. The cream appears pretty dark when first squeezed onto my hand which concerned  me because I have fairly light skin but when applied to the face it blends right in and is barely noticeable. It didn&#x27;t feel drying or irritate my skin except for a kind of sticky feeling which wasnt too annoying and went away after a little while. On the whole this is a pretty good product that I&#x27;ll continue to use but it&#x27;s not great enough for me to give up Supernatural.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen.  I was put off at first by the color, but it goes on so evenly and smoothly it&#x27;s a dream.  I won&#x27;t go on vacation without it ever again and I won&#x27;t go a summer without it.  It&#x27;s worth the investment.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d stray from MDSolar, until the price doubled. I tried this - and now I like it better! The color appears a bit darker (and less yellow) out of the tube, but it blends flawlessly to help even out my skin, which is a bit uneven in coloration from lifelong sun exposure. Also, it feels slightly less greasy than MDSolar, but goes on just as smoothly. My only concern is all the ingredients with names like &amp;#34;dimethicone.&amp;#34; I need to look that up ...</li>
    <li> Until I tried this product I assumed all SPF products were the same. They always seemed like they weren&#x27;t doing anything, plus they all seem to be loaded with parabens. I really like Cotz - I haven&#x27;t seen 40 SPF before and I really like the way it feels and works with my makeup. I have spent a good number of days in the sun and have not seen any redness or freckles. Now that I am starting to see sun spots, this is an important daily regimen. Because it blendable and breatheable, it works with my foundation and that makes it a winner.</li>
    <li> The tinted version of this is the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used (and, by the way, identical to the $45 Tizo3 sunscreen my dermatologist recommended). I wanted to try the &amp;#34;lighter&amp;#34; version for days when I don&#x27;t want/need a tinted/made up look (e.g., yoga on Saturdays). But yikes, the white cast on this version is horrendous. Not as bad as, say, CeraVe SPF 50 (for face), but still pretty nasty. Made me look even more pasty and ghost-like. Didn&#x27;t seem like it when I patch tested on my arm, but on my face, even after it sinks in and tones down quite a bit, there&#x27;s still that overall ghost effect. Nope nope. Going back to tinted version (CotZ Face Natural Skin Tones SPF 40).</li>
    <li> This is the best sunscreen I have ever used!  It felt like a makeup primer going on.  Did not irritate my sensitive skin or cause any breakout issues, and I was SHOCKED at how good my skin looked at the end of a long work day, smooth and satin matte.  It completely controlled my oil and actually made my makeup last longer, much like a primer does, but I don&#x27;t like to wear those everyday with all the other products that I use.  I will be using this forever!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.  Zinc/titanium sunblocks such as this are much safer than the chemical variety, but tend to be gummy.  I love the feel of this - it glides on smoothly, not at all greasy.  It evens out tone somewhat, but at my age I need powder too, which is easily applied over this.  I&#x27;m posting this review as I order another tube!</li>
    <li> I have melasma that gets worse very easily with even a little sun exposure. While it&#x27;s easy to put a sunscreen on under your makeup, I always want to re-apply frequently when I&#x27;m sweating or swimming. However, most sunscreens are white (or use chemicals that sting) and its hard to make it look good. This stuff has a nice tint that makes it almost like applying foundation, so you can put more on at the beach/pool and not worry that its looking white or rubbing in funny. Feels smooth and dry and performed well. I would recommend it!</li>
    <li> My first squeeze had me wondering if I did the right thing. The color looked darker than expected.... however, it spreads quite nicely, covers well and the hint of color is perfect.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It feels so silky and smooth. It has a little bit of color in it that adds a small amount of coverage and best of all it has a very matte finish which was the main thing I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Feels greasy and heavy on my face.</li>
    <li> This is my second year using it. Goes on very smooth, some people described it as oily, I prefer silky. Coverage is good with or without other makeup on. Long lasting. I have particularly sensitive skin and I have not experienced any reaction to it. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I really like this it is silky smooth on my skin and it has sun protection would buy again I bought some for my Daughter and she love it too!&lt;br /&gt;Just a little color so I can wear it alone are with my BB cream.</li>
    <li> I have been through tons of sun-preventive products.  This one glides on and is perfect for under powder. It feels light and most of all, natural and not CAKEY!  Definitely recommend and would absolutely purchase again!</li>
    <li> I love the matte finish on this.  Doesn&#x27;t leave the shine like most facial SPFs.</li>
    <li> I like how it feels on my skin and how it blends in. It is the best facial sunscreen I have used.</li>
    <li> I tried this product for a week before giving up on it.  My biggest issue with it was that it didn&#x27;t seem to be a very affective sunblock.  I got lightly sunburned after only 40 minutes outside while wearing this.  I&#x27;m always very careful to wear sunblock, and I haven&#x27;t gotten burned in years, so I was quite surprised by what happened when I used this.  This claims to be SPF 40, but I&#x27;m not convinced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My other main problem with this was that it did not go on translucent; it actually tinted my skin.  It claims to be a \\&quot;natural skin tone\\&quot;, but I&#x27;m not sure what that really means considering the hundreds of different skin tones that are present in the world.  I have very pale skin, and when I applied this product, my coworkers commented that it gave me a sickly yellowish coloring.  I thought it looked like someone who had used a cheap spray tan product.  The warnings on the tube say that it will stain clothing, but it certainly didn&#x27;t mention the effect on my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing that I liked about this cream was that it did not leave my skin feeling greasy, like many products do.  Of course, given the choice between a greasy sunblock that works and a non-greasy sunblock that doesn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;ll take the greasy one any day.</li>
    <li> I initially received this as a sample in a ipsy bag, &amp; since I received it don&#x27;t use anything else under my foundation. It seems to provide exceptional protection when outdoors (which is a biggie when you&#x27;re in the mid 30&#x27;s), but I have even used it on my 2 year old. I was initially concerned because it looks so dark coming out of the tube &amp; I have a very fair complexion, but it gives your skin just a hint of color which is very natural looking. I pray they never discontinue this one!!</li>
    <li> Summer hasn&#x27;t started up where I am yet, so I haven&#x27;t been able to test this with the sun in my face, but make-up wise, it seems fine. The tube is pretty small so it won&#x27;t last long if you apply it every day.</li>
    <li> This is actually a very nice product.  The combination of sunblock with skin color is handy for makeup routines.  For me personally, the skin color was a little darker than I wanted.  But that is just a matter of personal preference.  It is light and a good addition to one&#x27;s morning beauty routine.</li>
    <li> This is a great sunscreen for sensitive skin and it is not oily whatsoever.  I have melasma and need something very strong, unfortunately I breakout easily, so that elliminates a lot of sunscreens.  This was recommended to me by the clerk at Ulta, but I don&#x27;t get there often, so it was a no-brainer to buy it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Covers smoothly and is so silky feeling. Works well alone or under your regular foundation or mineral foundation.</li>
    <li> I ordered this mostly for sun protection but I was impressed with the shade. It is light and can hardly be seen. But it does a little covering  up those small wrinkles. I will probably order it again.</li>
    <li> Great product--but is it skin tone or sun screen?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product but I will only use it for myself, not my adult kids. I avoid using colored or tinted sunscreens on my boys as they are disabled.&lt;br /&gt;I figure the less additives the better. I feel that same way about laundry soaps with additives.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t offer this  to my 22 year old son either, but what you choose to do with it of course is enturely up to you.&lt;br /&gt;I have never tried Cotz before. I am very wary of introducing new products to the members of our family.&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, I like it very much for myself. Thanks!</li>
    <li> The lovely thing about this product is its lack of \\&quot;lotion-y feel\\&quot;. I was honestly expecting something more of a creamy, heavy feel. I was pleasantly surprised to test this first on my hand, and it was much more like a powder, leaving my skin soft and not shiny at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then gave it the ultimate test, wearing it on a warm day under make-up. Normally, I use Aveeno tinted moisturizer daily under my make-up. In the drier and colder months, its a nice layer of lotion against dryness. However, in the summer when I tend to sweat more, the lotion is just too heavy. This is where Cotz will shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied it under my powder and while it didn&#x27;t cover any blemishes, it certainly gave my skin a more even tone. I have lighter skin and the almost green undertone did wonders to balance the red on my cheeks. The lotion turns into a powder-like finish, as I stated before. It is so light you will wonder if it just dissipated into the air more than landed on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With make-up applied, I had no problems all day. No flaking or rubbing off, no sweating it out (in fact, my skin felt much like it did at 8am by 4pm). I can&#x27;t attest to the SPF, but I spent some time in the sun and had not one bit of red on my cheeks. This is a great alternative to creams and oil-based sun tan lotions, especially for nicer occasions when one is expected to be outdoors but still look nice (like a spring or summer wedding).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cost is a bit much, which honestly might prevent me from purchasing it in the future. But if I was going by feel alone, it would be a keeper (hence the 4 out of 5 stars).</li>
    <li> I got oily skin and have for the most part shied away from sunscreen lotion. The Cotz Face turns out to be quite usable on my face. It feels natural and does not feel greasy. I live in a region with a lot of sun all year round, so I&#x27;m happy this appears to be something I can put on on a regular basis - except for the rather high price for a small tube! I really wish they&#x27;d lower the price, as I so wan to order more.</li>
    <li> Though this product is advertised as \\&quot;non-greasy\\&quot;, the first thing that came out of the tube when I squeezed it was.. oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it anyway, to be able to give this a fair review, and after two days I completely broke out. My skin was also greasy all day when I used this. I&#x27;m just not a fan.. and I must have unnatural skin tone because the tint of this product did not match my face at all.</li>
    <li> I love it !!!! A +++++&lt;br /&gt;Super RECOMMEND !</li>
    <li> Cotz goes on smooth and stays on and with the tint you don&#x27;t need makeup if you don&#x27;t want it. It also works well under make up. The price jumped 4 dollars to 18.99 that is a big price increase.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without this!</li>
    <li> This is my second tube of this sunscreen.  Somehow the tint matches my skin tone just fine...and it&#x27;s like wearing sunscreen, primer and foundation all in one.</li>
    <li> Absolutely not greasy.  This goes on as a perfect matte finish that I don&#x27;t need add additional coverage to. If you think that you have run out of it, cut the top seam and there is a lot more to use</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I still have oily skin and this product covers it up. It also has a very light tint that makes your skin look smoother. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I use the Cotz sunscreen sparingly  because it new to me &amp; I don&#x27;t like a makeup look.  So far I&#x27;ve fouind it blends nicely with my skin, doesn&#x27;t leave any edges (in fact, iI can&#x27;t  see any lines).  I see a noticeable cover up of the spots &amp; discoloration on my face (very subtle coloring).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does what it says:  leaves my skin silky &amp; smooth, without an oily or greasy look or feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expecially like the fact that its 100% free of preservatives &amp; chemical  sunscreen oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to purchase more.</li>
    <li> I have very chemically sensitive skin and react to most chemical sunscreens.  My Dermatologist recommended this product for me and it has been great.  No adverse reactions at all and no sunburn either!  What more can you ask.</li>
    <li> Great sun protection and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or tacky. Doesn&#x27;t wear off even while swimming. Use this everyday, even in winter. I&#x27;ve recommended it to others.</li>
    <li> This blocker is amazing. I hate sun tan lotions and never used them because they were always greasy ,messy and stunk. My dermatologist recommended Cotz to me and gave me a sample packet after having to freeze several small sun caused skin cancers off me. It goes on easy and leaves no white glaze ( cause it is flesh tone color) and don&#x27;t leave you smelling weird. It also protects against  sun burn. It is a little pricey but it goes a long ways and not near as expensive buying several other brands of sun lotion that ends up sitting in the medicine cabinet unused .</li>
    <li> It has a very soft texture-unlike any other sunscreen I have tried,  It is not a lotion or cream. Feels great on my skin.  Looks like it is darker than it really is and has barely any color once on. This is NOT foundation, but may blur some slight imperfections. I forget I am even wearing sunscreen and will use this instead of foundation especially on really warm days.  Doesn&#x27;t run when you perspire either. I don&#x27;t know what people complain about having to use so much product.  Yes, the tube is kinda small, but it only takes a small amount to cover your face/neck.  You just have to spread it out and rub it in. If you are really fair skinned and burn easily, the color might be a little much and also perhaps you should try something with a higher spf. But if you are of average skin color, even darker pigmented, it should be fine. For the rest of your body, I would try a traditional sunscreen.</li>
    <li> This is my most coveted beauty secret.  The product is intended to provide protection from sun. Which is great!  But the product doubles as an excellent primer under your makeup.  I have oily skin and this product keeps my makeup looking fresh all day long.  People always ask me, how do you keep your makeup prefect all day?  This is how!  I would have given the product five stars but I wish they would provide darker shades. I will never buy an expensive primer again!</li>
    <li> (review courtesy of missus1rude)  This sunscreen has a really wonderful, silky texture, that feels more like a primer than a sunscreen.  I have tried multiple oil free sunscreens that still leave my skin looking greasy, and this product definitely doesn&#x27;t.  As advertised, it has a truly matte finish and absolutely no fragrance whatsoever.  I haven&#x27;t had occassion to put its 80 minute water resistant claim to the test, but it definitely creates a barrier that is obvious when I try to rinse my hands after applying it.  I am not exactly sure whether to apply the product as a sunscreen (generously) or a make-up (conservatively); so far I&#x27;ve been using it more like a make-up, applying just a pea sized amount.  If I use more than that, the \\&quot;Natural Skin Tone\\&quot; tint gives my pale skin a slightly orange-y cast, reminiscent of a bad self tan (although not as severe).  Using just a little minimizes this effect, but might negate the effectiveness of the sunscreen.  My other issue is obviously the cost; its quite expensive for 1.5oz, but since it could potentially replace regular foundation and/or powder, the cost might be worth it.</li>
    <li> Another great cream from Cotz.  This stuff blends in very well and protects from sun very well.  Color is not noticeable on skin.</li>
    <li> This product is a heaven sent for people who are sensitive to sunlight.  It has allowed me to enjoy outdoors again without turning into a glowing Strawberry!</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Received a sample in our Ipsy bag last month and now I can&#x27;t be without it. I tend to spend a lot of time outside and so far this summer I haven&#x27;t had one burn on my face, and I swim in a pool almost daily and the ocean quite a bit. I wear it daily like a makeup. Good stuff and is worth the money. The &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; color is sort of dark for my German-Irish skin but went well with my current tanned coloring (think coffee with just a touch of skim milk in it) and it does blend well. Once that fades though, I know I will have to move up to the lighter-skinned version so keep that in mind when thinking of which shade to buy.</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff!  My face feels so smooth after applying it and I like the slight tint of color plus sun protection.</li>
    <li> Works great, I use it alone or mix it with my foundation/BB cream. Whichever I am using that day, I love it &amp; it blends perfectly with my skin.</li>
    <li> Love this primer/sunscreen!&lt;br /&gt;Want to buy every single one !</li>
    <li> The sample was a lovely pink tint. What I got was dark brown.</li>
    <li> Fabulous... Use every day. Never got burned or even red at beach.  Bought for my daughters... They love it.  Goes well under makeup.</li>
    <li> The color appears dark, but disappears into your face, showing no tint whatsoever. It has a nice matte finish, so it&#x27;s good under a foundation, but I wouldn&#x27;t wear it alone unless you prefer NO tint.</li>
    <li> This is the first sunscreen I&#x27;ve tried that I can wear on my face daily. It is not greasy and goes on smoothly. I wear it over my daily moisturizer and under my make-up. This is become a staple in my daily routine. Found this product in my Birchbox and am forever grateful!</li>
    <li> It keeps me from burning at the beach. I had a really bad sunburn once on my face and I swore I would never let it happen again. This stuff just works. It has a wonderful silky feel, isn&#x27;t greasy and doesn&#x27;t run into your face when you swim. I even use it to cover my back tattoo with great success.</li>
    <li> Used as makeup. It covers small imperfections gives you a matte finish all day even if you are oily and tons of sun protection. Love it</li>
    <li> this is way over priced. BUT it seems to work. i like that it goes on without turning my face white (like other sunscreens made out of zinc or titanium) and it is dry, matte finish not oily. but it is very expensive for a tiny tube - a rip off.</li>
    <li> This goes go silky and smooth, not heavy at all, love the tint.  I would recommend this product, I use this every day!</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is wonderful. There&#x27;s none of the smell or greasiness that most sunscreens have. It goes on silky smooth and feels like something between a powder and a liquid. Since it is lightly tinted, I treat it as a makeup primer and use it every day.</li>
    <li> Make up glides on, you don&#x27;t need a lot of product, it seems to wear very well... Even going swimming! I love this product so much that I bought it for family and friends to try.</li>
    <li> After reading another  review which stated the sunscreen for fair skin was white and didn&#x27;t look natural I chose the natural tone.  It was too dark and thick making it difficult to blend around my eyes.  I felt like I was wearing a mask.  Ick!</li>
    <li> -It does NOT sting my face when I apply it&lt;br /&gt;-It covers smoothly and has a nice matte finish like a 2-in-one cream to powder foundation&lt;br /&gt;-A little goes a long way&lt;br /&gt;-It works well on top of moisturizers and under cover-up/foundations</li>
    <li> This appears great when you put it on, but it rubs off on to your clothing ( I used it for my upper chest area that is exposed in some of my blouses).  I also found that it leaves your face dried out looking and I think if you put moisturizer on top of it, it probably wouldn&#x27;t be as effective.</li>
    <li> I have some red spots and need extra help to cover them. I use it after applying the hydrating cream and before foundation.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend had this at girls beach weekend and when I tried it, I knew I had to order it!  So silky soft going on, blends very well, and dries with a matte finish!  I use the product as my foundation exclusively now!  The coverage is just what I need and with the sunscreen it&#x27;s a perfect combination!</li>
    <li> Love the matte feel, light coverage, blends well with my olive skin tone.</li>
    <li> Best sunblock ever! Everyone I have told about this sunblock loves it.</li>
    <li> After getting a sample of Cotz from my dermatologist, I fell in love with this sunscreen.  It not only protects my skin from the sun, but gives my face a smooth matte finish, and has a lovely silky feel.  I no longer have to wear foundation makeup, so even though Cotz is fairly expensive, I save on makeup.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AHHmazing. My skin is very sensitive and so I&#x27;m always reluctant to try new products for my face. $19 dollars for 1.5 oz I was very hesitant and then told myself YOLO and added it to my cart. I&#x27;m so glad I did. It&#x27;s true what the others say, it is a dark tint but It blended well into my light skin and I/my complexion was better for it. It feels like a primer more than a lotion. Additionally,this product offers so much more than just sun screen!! The first time I used it I spent the majority of the day in the sun, my skin didn&#x27;t sweat, my makeup didn&#x27;t run and my face didn&#x27;t burn, can you say triple threat?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sunscreen that takes care of my face and protects me from the sun. I am so thankful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Tip: Don&#x27;t get all crazy about the amount you squeeze out, a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have used. It makes your skin like velvet and evens your skin tone while feeling as light as no makeup. I can&#x27;t go without it. Use it every day!</li>
    <li> I love the way it feels. I&#x27;m totally converted to using this and getting rid of the icky stuff. Try it!</li>
    <li> Love this sunblock! It is super silky and very easy to put on. The texture and the fact that it is tinted evens out your skintone and protects from the sun at the same time. I use it everyday and I thought I would run out very quickly, but surprisingly the tube lasts a while.</li>
    <li> Works great, feels great, but way too dark for fair-medium skin tone. Also, the brown color of the product intensifies on any dry skin or blemish.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Make my face look smooth! I would recommend this to anyone who wants a good sunscreen with a nice finish.</li>
    <li> This has a wonderful smooth and almost powdery feel. Blends in nicely and can be worn alone without any foundation over it. It blurs any imperfections and wears well. Plus the SPF 40 is great to have.</li>
    <li> Just love it can&#x27;t go without it. Lily</li>
    <li> I buy this product regularly, keeps skin protected; super light coverage, matte finish</li>
    <li> I would scoff at a $20 sunscreen usually but I am sold on this on! It goes on clear and keeps my shiny t zone at bay and I don&#x27;t even have to use a primer anymore. Great product.</li>
    <li> I recommend the Cotz Plus SPF 58 instead of this. I have used it for years on my face and love the slight tinting and absorption. I used this Cotz Face once and thought I was going to enjoy it. Then I went in the pool. I wiped the water off my face and it  and came off in my hands in particulates and colored gunk (best way to describe it). Stick with the Cotz Plus 58. I give that 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Used in puerto Rico and will use as a daily. Natural tint requires no additional makeup. Worked great for beach</li>
    <li> Offers great sun protection with a beautiful matte finish. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this in one of my beauty box subscriptions and fell in love.  It provides good sunscreen and light, matte coverage.  It doesn&#x27;t upset my skin and also keeps me practically oil free most of the day.  And that, my friends, is saying something since I&#x27;m greasier than the Exxon Valdez.  The lightweight formula is particularly nice here in the south where during the summer temperatures quickly reach Hellfire level and most makeup I&#x27;ve worn in the past melts off like candle wax.  This product is going to be a permanent addition to my beauty routine.</li>
    <li> I ordered both this and the white version, which blends in without affecting skin tone. If you have medium skin tone, this one will probably be fine, but my skin is fair and the tinted version seems to look a little unnatural on me. But I love the product! It has only natural minerals (zinc, titanium dioxide), no chemicals, so it doesn&#x27;t smell at all. It is matte and doesn&#x27;t get shiny. In fact, it is now my primer under foundation because the texture is so smooth.</li>
    <li> natural tone, feels greasy but not as bad as others. could be very useable as an under makeup base SUNSCREEN</li>
    <li> I wish I would have found this stuff years ago its like a miracle sun block its crazy!! It works well is not oils or greasy and it feels great on your skin!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find a moisturizer/sunscreen that wouldn&#x27;t make my face shiny. This one is perfect! After I massage it into my skin, it makes my skin look very even and not at all oily. I also have somewhat dehydrated skin, so I apply a little bit of jojoba oil before putting this on.</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on customer reviews and a high rating on EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep database.  Basically, I was looking for a daily face sunscreen with truly broad-spectrum protection (at least SPF 30) that wasn&#x27;t super expensive and wouldn&#x27;t make my face look oily or streaky.  I also wanted something that would layer well under makeup since I work in a professional office setting.  This product is everything I wanted and more!  It is tinted and provides coverage like a foundation (matte finish), but looks and feels totally natural - even better than Bare Minerals, and I love that stuff.  Seriously, my skin looks AMAZING.  (In terms of tint, I found it to be just right for my skin tone, which is fairly medium/fairly light by Bare Minerals standards.)  The product comes out of the package as a liquid, and turns into a velvety powder as you rub it in.  There is absolutely no greasiness!  In fact, it seems to soak up or counteract the oil that my skin produces during the day.  Normally, my face starts getting shiny around 3pm.  Not with this stuff!  Cotz, where have you been all my life?!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re a medium skin tone, I imagine this would be great. But, if you&#x27;re anywhere near a light skin tone or pinkish skin tone, buy the one for light skin tones even though that one is white colored. This is a yellow beige color and way to dark for my skin. Otherwise, the product itself is great.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist doctor recommended for me, I think is nice, silky and not greasy, just what I need for my kind of problem. Although I think it is expensive because I use it in a daily basis. I love the color it has, you can use it as a foundation.</li>
    <li> This spf cream is amazing! Feels like cream with powder, looks very naturally, I absolutely love it! My skin feels so soft and silky after using this cream. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I wanted to switch to a face sunscreen that was made of zinc oxide and not other chemical sunscreens. I tried this sunscreen in a sample and mediately bought the full size. I do have fair skin and bought the natural tone because I didn&#x27;t know they had a lighter one..I may try the light tone next but the darker shade really doesn&#x27;t bother me - I just rub it in extra, especially around my eyebrows. I love love love that it doesn&#x27;t make your face shiny or oily feeling and definitely doesn&#x27;t make it white. This sunscreen feels light and almost powdery after you rub it in. I would highly recommend this product - I just wish it came in a bigger size! I do not use it as a daily face sunscreen since it feels a little thick for that, but that&#x27;s how I feel about all zinc oxide sunscreens so it doesn&#x27;t make a difference for me.</li>
    <li> I have purchased the Cotz line of skin care protection before. This variety has a tint and provides coverage as well as natural-looking color for my skin. Will reorder when I need more.</li>
    <li> My face broke out the next day in 3 spots. Not worth the expense anyway - super tiny container.</li>
    <li> I have originally tried a sample of this product and it was amazing!!! So I went ahead and bought the full bottle (though it seems tiny! I hoped it would be bigger - But i know it will last a while)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate putting anything on my face other than a bit of toner and moisturizer so I was a bit skeptical, but I was going out to an amusement park for the whole day and needed to cover up my face! Needless to say I was very surprised that it went on silky smooth and stayed on my face all day giving protection from the sun. My face did not get oily or red, like it does with any other sunscreen. so I was SOLD!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its important to mention too, that I&#x27;m very VERY fair skinned and I was concerned that the tint may be too dark, but it just gave me a little glow and looked great!</li>
    <li> If you can use primers that are almost pure silicone, you may like this lotion.  This is a tinted silicone lotion with SPF.  Unfortunatley, products like this break me out.</li>
    <li> This is amazing sunscreen for your face! I love it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as I wanted a sunscreen that would be moisturizing and yet not cakey.  I&#x27;ve found it in this product. It comes out of the tube with a medium brown tint, but really goes on clear. I&#x27;m not sure how they do that but it works.  My face doesn&#x27;t dry out during the day and it has that high SPF value that I couldn&#x27;t find in facial sunscreens.</li>
    <li> Great product! Goes on easily, very sheer and non-greasy. I would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the product.  Someone told me how much they liked it and I thought I would try it.</li>
    <li> Like the way this product goes on like make up.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this product and recommend it to everyone.  I think it actually acts as a primer/moisturizer/sunscreen and leaves your face with a silky smooth satiny finish.  It comes out of the tube in a tan color but blends out to match most skin colors. (There is a lighter version for very pale skin - I have light/fair skin and this color works great.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CoTZ Face is very natural looking but works well with make-up too. Some days, I put it on before my powder foundation and other days, I mix it with my liquid foundation - both techniques work well and give you a natural non-cakey finish.  The consistency of the product is like a dry mousse so it&#x27;s very easy to control the amount you dispense - I squeeze out something between a pea and a lima bean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> the best product ever..no makeup needed</li>
    <li> This goes on so easily and holds during hot days.  I have never burned using this product!</li>
    <li> Really love this product.  A friend told me about it, I read the reviews and now I&#x27;m a believer.  It gives my makeup a great base and it protects my very sensitive skin better than any sunblock I&#x27;ve used.  It&#x27;s smooth, not oily at all yet not drying either.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Excellent sun screen protection for your face. I have been using this for over one year and just love it. I am in the Florida sun daily and this is the absolute best</li>
    <li> This truly is the very best sunscreen!! It not only is a sunscreen to protect your skin, but it makes my face look so much better, in that  it evens out my skin tone, but also improves the over-all complexion so very &#x27;naturally&#x27; -  I daily receive compliments on how good my skin looks.  Not only does my skin look really fantastic, but it feels so super soft and silky.  No more need of facial cosmetics.  GREAT product. A very little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Although this may seem quite dark in color when you first squeeze it out of the tube, once blended in, it works with my skin tone. It may be that the tint they add counteracts the white sheen or flashback that you get with zinc based sunscreens, which ever it is, I like it. I was initially concerned that the cyclopentasiloxane and methicone ingredients would clog my pores and cause a break out, but that has been minimal. It also makes a good makeup primer</li>
    <li> Love, love, love!  After having skin cancer twice on my face (one requiring skin grafts) I started wearing a  higher SPF year round on my face.  This was recommended to me and I am so glad I listened!  I got the tinted one and I find this is just enough color to even out my skin-tone without looking unnatural.  It goes on easily and feels silky.  The added bonus about Cotz is that when I am outside in the garden, it does not run into my eyes and burn like some other facial sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried.  One tube lasts me about 6+ months.  I sometimes blend it with my foundation, too, when I want a bit more coverage makeup-wise.  I really love this product.  I have been using it for about  two years (on my third tube) and will continue to use Cotz.  I love the ease of application, the silky feel on my skin, and the  way the color evens out my skin.....I am a natural blond with fair sin and it great.  Even the doctor mentioned how nice and natural it looked on my skin - she didn&#x27;t realize it came in tainted version.  She said she would recommend it to a few of her other patients!  Now that is definitely a 4+star rating!</li>
    <li> I really like this , just wish it had a little more brown to the color.</li>
    <li> I really like this.  It is light, it provides a nice light coverage, and it works.</li>
    <li> I like Cotz Face sunscreen. It does have color. I mix it with the Cotz Face for lighter skin tones and it&#x27;s perfect for my pale skin. It is matt. It goes on smoothly. It doesn&#x27;t burn, sting, pill, or feel heavy. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I like this, because it&#x27;s not super thick.  It goes on silky.</li>
    <li> Works as presented.  I had received a free sample of this, loved it and bought more.  Fine coverage without much product; nice skin tone, natural-looking and non-irritating.  I normally hate sunblock but I use this all the time.  No nasty smell or burning with a really fine matte finish.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and I react to many sunscreens, and the smell of many sunscreens gives me a headache.  This stuff doesn&#x27;t give me a headache and the one time I used it from a sample container, it worked well.  I was a little freaked out with the tint, but it didn&#x27;t look like I was wearing makeup, yet it kept me from looking like I was wearing kabuki makeup.  A lot of the titanium dioxide-based sunscreens are really white and make you look funny i.e. dead.  This one not so much as it is skin-tinted.  This is oil free and over all worked well with minimal impact.</li>
    <li> I assumed it was tinted, it is not.  Amazon graciously refunded my expense.  This is a terrific product but I wish it had more color to it</li>
    <li> great base coverup that acts as a primer and sunscreen in one.  I put this on as my base and put a light powder on over it.  This is a must for this Florida woman!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many sunscreens looking for one that wouldn&#x27;t leave my face all oily and shiny.  Cotz is amazing!  It is a mousse like texture and is very light.  It is easy to apply and blend into the skin, a little goes a long way.  I have tan/olive skin and I found that this tint did make my face slightly lighter than normal, so I wish Cotz made a darker tint.  It wasn&#x27;t a noticeable difference though.  It is truly matte and leaves no shine on my face, which is great because other sunscreens that claim to be matte are never really matte.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I expected.  I know it was just a tinted sunscreen; however,  I expected  it would give you a little brightness to your complexion, which it didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  It feels like silk going on and is incredibly light.  It is extremely effective at preventing sunburn and I recommend it to everyone I know.  I will be buying more of this product!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best facial sunscreen I have ever used!  The natural skin tone blends in great with my skin and applies silky smooth so I use less of my mineral powder foundation.  I have very sensitive skin and this sunscreen has been a blessing since it&#x27;s so difficult to find facial products that don&#x27;t irritate by skin.  Great price too.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Good product. Happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> This is the most blendable, high quality mineral sunscreen.  It also functions as sort of a beauty balm.</li>
    <li> unsuitable for sensitive skin ,very thick like brown mud , greasy. A bad choice after laser treatments. Do not lose your money</li>
    <li> I seriously love it. Doesn&#x27;t leave an oily finish. For those that are acne prone you have nothing to worry about! It makes my makeup last all day too I like to put a GENEROUS amount because I&#x27;m trying to protect my skin as much as possible</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic sun screen.  It has just a touch of color but the best thing is the creamy feel after you apply it.  I live in Florida so sunscreens are quite important.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have sensitive skin but had no problems using this product.  The skin-tone color is a perfect match and makes your complexion look soft and velvety.  I will use this product as long as it is available.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This is not designed to be very opaque.  Just a hint of color and higher SPF than most tinted moisturizers.  Great price.  Can smear on like regular sunscreen, won&#x27;t look weird without applying in front of a mirror.</li>
    <li> Best ever sunscreen  and make up primer!  Goes on smoothly and leaves skin feeling smooth and silky. A little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Excellent coverage as sun block.</li>
    <li> I was recently diagnosed with vitiligo, which mostly presents on my face. I wanted a sunscreen that had some tint to it that could blend everything together and make me look normal. The product description and the reviews I read specified this product would provide the tint I needed. It does not. There is no tint to it at all. To be clear, the lotion is tinted, but does not impart that tint to my skin. And to make matters worse, it is not returnable. Caveat emptor.</li>
    <li> Our dermatologist recommended this cream...great  enough recommendation for me :))</li>
    <li> I have applied this in the morning and gone to the ocean in the afternoon and it still protected my face from sunburn.</li>
    <li> Cotz blends well into the skin and only a small amount is needed. It protects the face from sun spots and does all that it promises.</li>
    <li> This is such a great SPF for my face.  It&#x27;s soft and doesnt wash off in water. The water drips off my face with this on and it&#x27;s not greasy like others that I have experienced. You have to use soap and water to get it off your hands after applying it. It has a very nice, natural color to it - I use it everyday under my makeup primer.  My husband even uses it as SPF outdoors as well.</li>
    <li> I have developed extremely sensitive skin, and after spending months (and significant money) trying to find a chemical free sunblock and a foundation that I could wear together without developing stinging, itching, burning, red, irritated skin, I stumbled upon this wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cotz Face has given me no irritation in five months, and though the color when it comes out of the bottle is startling, it blends beautifully on my very fair skin. After applying, I brush on a little of Origins &amp;#34;multigrain makeup&amp;#34; and voila&#x27;!  I&#x27;ve got great coverage and protection from the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product so much that I have it automatically shipped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have very sensitive, fair skin and want a little coverage for your face and neck, this is an excellent solution. Given that you&#x27;re getting two products in one, I think the price is great; much less than the foundation I previously used. I&#x27;m a bit of a walking billboard for Cotz; I want everyone to know about this great product!</li>
    <li> I like the fact that it&#x27;s a natural sun screen, but it does feel like a silicone primer when you glide it on your face and that&#x27;s exactly how I use it. It works well as a under makeup primer and a lot healthier than most of those out there. Kind of pricey for the amount you get. Hence the four stars.</li>
    <li> Favorite sunblock. Feels smooth going on, has a little color in it so your skin doesn&#x27;t look like a ghost. Just wish it came in bigger quantities: like a jug.</li>
    <li> Great product for everyday use</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  Great feel as it glides on.  It says it is tinted, but I am fair w/ freckles and it&#x27;s fine....can&#x27;t tell I have on any color.  I wear it for tennis in NV and no issue at all with sweat or it stinging my eyes or skin.  LOVE!!</li>
    <li> Excellent, so far the best for me.</li>
    <li> This is the first sunscreen I&#x27;ve used that&#x27;s advertised as specifically designed for the face - I generally use a daily moisturizer with sunscreen and makeup with SPF, even when spending a great deal of time out of doors - mostly because I have very oily skin and most sunscreens (even the so-called \\&quot;dry touch\\&quot; formulas) tend to feel heavy and greasy and I honestly didn&#x27;t except the \\&quot;face\\&quot; versions to be any different.  Cotz Face is a mineral formula, though, so I had hoped it wouldn&#x27;t be quite as bad.  It also promises a matte finish which I&#x27;ve never heard of in sunscreen before.  So how did it do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product feels great going on, silky smooth and soft.  Once it has absorbed into the skin you can&#x27;t feel it at all - it doesn&#x27;t feel like you have a thick layer of heavy glop sitting on your face.  It&#x27;s more like wearing a light tinted moisturizer, really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The finish is very softly matte at first but it didn&#x27;t last for me.  But then, my skin is so extremely oily I didn&#x27;t expect it to, and those with normal or dry skin may see a longer lasting matte finish than I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is very subtle and it is formulated for light to medium skin tones.  I am extremely pale, so you can tell I&#x27;m wearing something, but it doesn&#x27;t look mask-like.  For folks with a bit more natural color, it might blend seamlessly.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for very dark skin, though I anticipate Cotz will introduce more shades eventually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve worn the product alone and under makeup, and I can say it performed well in both situations.  It isn&#x27;t going to replace your moisturizer for every day wear (I believe I could get away with it due to the oily nature of my skin).  But for a day by the pool or sightseeing in the sun and heat, it&#x27;s a great little product to have in your beauty bag.</li>
    <li> ~&lt;br /&gt;I like it. I&#x27;ve used this sunscreen on my face for the past few days while working outside in the yard and I haven&#x27;t burned my skin which is a fair to medium complexion. It came out of the tube a brown color but was quickly blended into my own natural tint. It felt soft, smooth, and silky; not greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;Not only would I recommend this product, but I&#x27;ll purchase it for myself when this tube runs out.</li>
    <li> Goes on so smooth and easy</li>
    <li> I love this product!!</li>
    <li> I have decided to edit my review.  For many months I used the colorless version of Cotz but decided to try the Natural Skin Tone tube I had which I ordered by mistake.  It&#x27;s really now my favorite.  Unlike the former Cotz which has no color added that feels a bit greasy and has white streaks if you don&#x27;t rub it in, the natural skin tone feels like silk.  Hard to really describe unless you try a tube, which by the way lasts a surprisingly long time.  A little goes a long ways.  I&amp;#34;m out in the sun many hours a day (in the SF bay area, CA) and have found this sunscreen works with one application (I&#x27;m not swimming) and my complexion has improved over the past 2 months with use.  I appreciate that not every face tone will find the color acceptable but for me it is great.  I use no other over all make-up and at the end of the day if I need to, only a touch of &amp;#34;neutral&amp;#34; color powder.</li>
    <li> Like the way it goes on and the matte finish.  Good coverage, light</li>
    <li> This product makes it possible to help mask a huge skin cancer scar while providing protection. Most hype that accompanies cosmetics is only hype. The products disappoint. This CoTZ Face is better than the ads. It is the only product I will ever use, and I will always buy it here. I purchased the first tube via Coolibar. When the bottom was not sealed and the product spurted out of the tube, staining a blouse, I carefully noted tube details and sent them off to the manufacturer. They sent me to Coolibar, where I was asked if I wanted a refund or a replacement. Are they serious? No. I wanted to absorb the cost of the defect. They still have not responded. Coolibar and CoTZ make the products I need. And Amazon is the only place I&#x27;ll purchase them.</li>
    <li> I am one of those people who wears sunscreen all year long.  There is skin cancer (basal cell) on both sides of my family and I want to do everything I can to protect myself.  This product is a rather dark color in the tube but it worked for my very fair skin when I put it on.  (The color doesn&#x27;t really show once you put it on.  I suspect the tint is designed to counteract the whiteness of the sunscreen ingredients.  You would still need to use foundation or BB cream on top of this if those are products you normally use anyway.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mineral sunscreens in CoTZ products (titanium dioxide and zinc oxide) are my preferred sunscreen ingredients -- especially to be used on my face -- as I&#x27;ve had some allergic or sensitivity reactions from chemical sunscreens.  Perhaps because of the tint, this blends into my skin much better than other mineral sunscreens.  There&#x27;s no white residue all over my face afterwards.  I also like the smooth, almost powdery feel that this leaves on my face.  It&#x27;s not greasy or oily at all.  It&#x27;s very easy to apply and has a smooth texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My typical routine is to use cleanser, toner, moisturizer, then sunscreen.  I usually follow with a foundation primer and liquid foundation, then a little finishing powder.  (That sounds like a lot.)  This product works well in that routine; I don&#x27;t get any shine on my face midday.  It also works for lazy weekend days when I decide not to use foundation.  I&#x27;ve used a couple of similar products lately (trying to find the best one for me) and I think this interferes less with my current cream blush than the equivalent Coola tinted SPF product.  For what it&#x27;s worth, this seems to &amp;#34;get along with&amp;#34; my skin pretty well.  I&#x27;ve experienced no new breakouts or irritation since using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely happy with this product and glad I gave it a chance despite the dark tint.  (I&#x27;ve since ordered this in the lighter tint to see how I&#x27;ll like that.  The performance of the product is excellent.)is excellent.)</li>
    <li> I like this sun screen- it goes on smoothly and it&#x27;s tinted, so it evens out your skin tone a bit. The texture is unique, but I like the feel of it- its more velvety than creamy. The good thing about this sunscreen is there is no white cast when spread on. The one thing I don&#x27;t like about it is it&#x27;s full of silicones (thus, the velvety texture). Silicones can clog my skin, so I only use this every now and then. I prefer my Juice Beauty CC cream for everyday, which still lets my skin breathe.</li>
    <li> UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, this started to dry out my skin. It also does not look as good under my makeup as I originally had thought.  It also gives you the white cast you get from sunscreen if you wear it under your makeup. Now I only use this as a primer on my oily areas which is my t zone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been on a search for a natural high SPF sunscreen that won&#x27;t break me out and still looks good under makeup.  After trying many different products I was led to this gem!  The first time I used this under my makeup and went to work everyone told me how smooth and even my skin looked that day.&lt;br /&gt;It does have a pretty dark hint to it so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this if you are fair skinned. I am a NC35 in MAC and this works perfectly for me.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this for anyone with oily skin.  I wear this under my makeup and it keeps my skin matte all day.  When I don&#x27;t wear this under my makeup I have to blot my skin consistently throughout the day, but when I wear this I don&#x27;t have to blot more than 2 or 3 times at max.  This is like a BB cream/tinted moisturizer.  I will update this if it ends up causing me to break out as I have very sensitive and acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> I like this one better than the white one, because it simply disappears into the skin, leaving no residue at all.  This must be new, as I have never seen it before.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, good for your skin. Take care of your face, wear a hat and use a good spf.</li>
    <li> If I apply it evenly, it can look better than my foundation. It feels really good on my skin too, but it&#x27;s not as effective as my other sunblocks.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended by my dermatologist when she gave me samples.  She also has the most amazing skin and she swears by this product.  She recently told me my skin looks ten years younger than it is.  I love the feel and all my other cosmetics go on so smoothly over it.  You just can&#x27;t go wrong....try it!!</li>
    <li> TOO LITE.  NEEDS TO BE A LITTLE DARKER.  JOHN</li>
    <li> This product feels and looks great on. Unlike regular sunscreen, I cannot feel it on your skin. It&#x27;s not greasy and it gives slight coverage. Some people have complained of the cost, so I looked at my orders. I have ordered the 1.5 oz tube 3 times since 2013. I use it for daily protection on my face and hands and it lasts about 10 months for me. So that is about $1.70 per month. To me, that is affordable for such a great product. I live in Central Florida where it is sunny, hot and sweaty. I use additional sunscreen products if going to the beach for the day, a 50spf on my arms and legs and 50spf zinc on my face.&lt;br /&gt; I hope the manufacturer doesn&#x27;t change the formula one bit. It seems this always happens when I&#x27;ve found a great product.</li>
    <li> Excellent sunscreen. Gets a little thick around half tube, but still goes on smoothly and looks great. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I am 51yrs old and love this stuff BUT I have oily skin and this works perfect as a sunblock and I secondly use it as an everyday makeup foundation.  I notice greatly reduced shine on my face.  It goes on silky smooth.  I would imagine that if someone had dry skin, this would dry it out even more.  This size tube lasts me about 3 months.</li>
    <li> ...and I have used every sunscreen out there. I have oily skin, I&#x27;ve had skin cancer twice, I&#x27;m very pale, and I live in San Diego. My eyes are very sensitive to sunscreen and a number of pricey and high SPF products that are supposed to be super gentle made my eyes burn and water. I tried this sunscreen because it was a mineral sunscreen, hoping that a chemical free sunscreen would do the trick. And it did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on very smooth and silky, almost like a powder, and dries to a matte finish. It doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes at all, even when I sweat. It also stays on very well and doesn&#x27;t get greasy or shiny even by the end of the day. I have put it on in the morning and gone all day in the sun without reapplying it and not burned. The first time I used it, I almost threw it away because it comes out of the tube dark brown, but I figured I might as well give it a try since I bought it. It blended very well on my skin and although I am very pale, it didn&#x27;t look too dark. I&#x27;d call it a healthy glow and unless you&#x27;re literally as white as a sheet, you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem with this sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It goes on smooth and leaves your skin feeling like silk. Non-greasy and lightly tinted that melts into your skin. Just love it!</li>
    <li> I work outside and my dermatologist recommended this product to me at my last exam. Typically the products he recommends are really expensive but this was the same price as my current face lotion, so I decided to give it a try. The first time I used it, I was surprised by the texture. I was expecting a standard lotion but this is more like a make-up primer. I love how smooth and sleek it feels when you apply it to your face. The tint also adds a nice hint of color, enhancing my skin tone. Better yet, I have oily skin and my face gets really shiny during the day. With this product, I&#x27;ve noticed a huge reduction in both oil and shine. Finally, it is chemical free, which is nice. I&#x27;ve recommended it to several of my friends and plan to buy more.</li>
    <li> During the summer, my skin gets crazy oily.  I have tried every product that claims to be oil-free and it still leaves me super shiny.  Until, I ran across COTZ.  Its rather pricey given the amount of product that you get, but after using this for several weeks it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dark olive skin and the tint in this product is perfect.  A little product goes a long way too!  It goes on easily kinda like a matte mousse and blends into a powdery finish...that&#x27;s the best way I can describe it (or better yet, a powder-gel).  It doesn&#x27;t get rid of all the shine, but it SIGNIFICANTLY reduced the oil on my face that I no longer look like I dipped a cotton ball in baby oil and lathered my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently took this to the pool and it afforded me the best protection against the sun and I wasn&#x27;t even wearing hat.  Usually, no matter how much sun block I put on my face, I always manage to get a little rosy from the sun, but not now.  What is even better is that that it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores like most sunscreens and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy AT ALL!</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is wonderful! It is the ONLY facial sunscreen I have tried that actually makes my face look better with it on. Further, there are minimal ingredients in it and none of those scary additives found in many sunscreens. It works very well. It is a bit expensive but with this I no longer am wearing any sort of tinted moisturizer or foundation so it actually ends up being cheaper. Love it!</li>
    <li> Gave me a rash. My favorite is &amp;#34;Minus Sol&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I like this product because protect my skin and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy i like that it put a little color and the sking looks nice</li>
    <li> I was really surprised at how dark this sunscreen is, and even more surprised at how well it blends in! I actually had it in my bag while out and about with my baby, and it was so sunny I decided to use it on her legs and surprisingly it blended into her fair baby legs  really well (after sufficient rubbing). It doesn&#x27;t really smell like anything and is not greasy! Great sunscreen.</li>
    <li> This stuff scared me when I first squeezed it out - it&#x27;s brown!  But it goes on very clear, surprisingly enough, although I think it does have a light tendency to even out the skin tone.  It&#x27;s a very refreshing feeling, at least at first, but gradually it did leave my face feeling slightly coated.  It&#x27;s protection must work.  I have to wear sunscreen on my face outside and this hasn&#x27;t caused me any sun issues.  I would buy this again over the Aveda product I purchased for the same kind of use that smells like paint when I put it on.  I think that this product might cling to the skin just a little bit too well, however.  I also use it on the back of my hands for sun protection and when using an anti-aging product after cleansing at night, I still find a bit of brown residue on the pads.  Hasn&#x27;t caused any skin irritation, however, and there&#x27;s no unpleasant odor.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product: it is a real spf 40 and an excellent primer (sometimes i wear it by itself,no need of foundation after it!) -i will buy it again and again (and at an affordable price)</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. It blends in perfectly with my skin tone, has a matte finish, and makes my skin velvety smooth. It&#x27;s the perfect sunscreen! Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is very smooth feeling.  It has a light brown color, which quickly blends as it is rubbed into skin.  It seems to provide adequate protection from the sun.</li>
    <li> This goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky.  I play a lot of tennis and won&#x27;t leave the house without this on.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way, gives you face a smooth matte finish, does not cause break out (I think I have the most sensitive skin on earth), oil control. I think it little bit prevents the break out due to the Zinc content in it. It also helps lil bit with the scars, and help hide and fade the scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:-&lt;br /&gt;Does not really moisturize your face.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist told me to buy this.  It is sheer,goes on easily and replaces facial makeup.  You don&#x27;t need much to cover. My doctor recommended it for my very fair skin to prevent burning.</li>
    <li> - spreads easily and feels silky, not greasy&lt;br /&gt;- works as a foundation - I use no other foundation simultaneously</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. Used it everyday while cruising for the sunscreen and coverage (wrinkles) and it worked great. Its lightweight and blends in quickly. HIghly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is the best sunscreen ever! My dermatologist recommended this one over a more expensive brand I was using. A little goes a long way. I use it as a base/primer and just put a loose powder over the top. It goes on so smooth. It is darker than my skin but once I put it on it thins to a nice coverage. Plus I can get it online or retail stores really easy. Love it!</li>
    <li> Best sunscreen for your face on the market. I have extremely oily skin and this sunscreen works great by itself or under my makeup without adding a greasy feel. Love it!</li>
    <li> Some people can&#x27;t tolerate the chemical sun screens, so for those people, this may be an option.  The active ingredients in this product are titanium dioxide 8% and zinc oxide 3.8%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream looks tan and opaque as it comes out of the tube and I worried it would look funny on my face but it does blend in and you can&#x27;t see it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My complaint is how it feels.  I don&#x27;t like the way it feels on my face.  I was expecting it to soak in more but I touch my face and it feels greasy.  I&#x27;m going back to the more typical sun screens.</li>
    <li> I first tried a  sample of this &amp; was very impressed with how easily it applied. It blended well with my skin tone and gave it a matte finish. It didn&#x27;t cover blemishes, but it did serve as a primer for my makeup. The matte finish lasted longer than I expected (I only blotted my face once during a ten hour work day). I like it better than using my current BB cream. Oh, a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Feel really nice when it goes on.  Is a little dark for my complexion though, maybe I ordered the wrong color.</li>
    <li> Living in Central Florida, the beaches are just a short drive away.  Unfortunately, so is the intense, damaging sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I got this item from Amazon, it arrived in a rather flimsy padded envelope, and the contents had been smashed.  After contacting Amazon, a replacement was quickly dispatched.  Interestingly, the replacement was also sent in a padded envelope though it wasn&#x27;t damaged the second time around.  A small box containing bubblewrap would have been a more logical choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as it was delivered, it was quickly requisitioned by my wife and stepdaughter.  My stepdaughter, prone to oily skin, thought it was easy to apply and loved the light color which matched her skin tone.  A trip to the beach proved that the SPF (40) was effective for an average stay at the beach.  My wife re-applied the product every 3 hours after sun exposure and she was impressed with the protection and how it evened out her skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price point is a little high but still reasonable compared to luxury cosmetic house brands.  A little goes a long way, and this tube will probably last though most of the summer season.  Overall - recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product as a make-up primer for the last few weeks. I really like the way my make-up goes on smoother and stays in place longer than when I don&#x27;t use it. The texture is silky and smooth. It has just the right amount of tint to even out my skin tone, but not so much that it&#x27;s noticeable. However, be advised that it might stain if it gets on clothing or towels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And while I know you still need to wear actual sunscreen if you plan to be out in the sun for extended periods of time, this is great for everyday use - to and from work, running errands, etc. It gives you that extra bit of sun protection.&lt;br /&gt;In addition, I have noticed that my skin feels smoother since I began using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave it four stars is because of the price. At $19.99 for only 1 1/2 ounces, it&#x27;s not something that I think I will be able to purchase on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If price is not a factor, I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this from my dermatologista.  At first I loved the way it covered and the slight bit of tint, making me feel like I was wearing cover-up without having to, although  I did notice that it was hard to apply because of the thickness (like paste),&lt;br /&gt;After using it for about 2 weeks however, I realized my face was becoming rough from the was my pores were getting really badly clogged.  I had to set out looking for another quality tinted sunscreen..):</li>
    <li> Matte finish, healthy ingredients. Love this! My second purchase of this product.</li>
    <li> I love the Cotz face natural skin tone: the protection it gives and the translucent color it produces. This says it all!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling like you have a heavy coat of shiny oil on your face which is great. Feels like a makeup primer. Expensive product though.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen. I&#x27;m very pale (MAC NW13 for reference) but I can still blend this into my skin tone. It&#x27;s matte, glides easily, and doesn&#x27;t smell or feel like sunscreen. I use this daily now.</li>
    <li> My family took a trip to the mountains and I decided to use this instead of traditional sunscreen for my face. At first I was hesitant. I know it says \\&quot;Natural skin tone\\&quot; and \\&quot;blends translucent\\&quot; but I am Asian and things that look \\&quot;natural\\&quot; on others don&#x27;t necessarily look natural on me. I was especially wary when I squeezed the product out of the tube and it was so dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I winded up very pleased with the product. It really did blend in. It didn&#x27;t look like I was wearing anything at all; my skin just looked more even-toned. It was also very smooth and powder-light; not like greasy sunscreen that leaves a while film on your face. We went rafting on the river, then hiking afterward and the entire time, my face was protected from the sun.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff-I do have to moisturize first-though/I am dry/ or it kind of hardens like a mask-as long as I put my moisturizing oil on underneath-&lt;br /&gt;Lasts ALL day-through sweat and swimming--ONE application, beautiful color-no burning, stinging or discomfort-extremely effective sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;Allison FLORIDA</li>
    <li> applies smoothly, and has a slight tint so no white film. Totally non-greasy, has a matte finish. Seems to last forever, I only use this on my face, and altho I initially thought the price was high, you only need a dab. I have sensitive skin and wanted to avoid irritating chemical sunscreens. This does the trick</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff! It has an amazing matte finish and I love the way it feels so silky. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Really like this product.  It was recommened to me by my dermatologist.  I have stopped using a makeup base now, because it is tinted.</li>
    <li> i use moisturizer and foundation creams and usually when i apply sunscreen the product &amp;#34;pills&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Cotz is easy to apply and goes on smoothly and evenly and there is NO pilling.</li>
    <li> Great product and is better than any like product we have tried.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this sunscreen when I&#x27;m outside doing yard work and it had worked wonderfully.  It goes on smooth, and does not leave any greasy feeling to my face.  I haven&#x27;t had any acne breakouts from using it, or any irritation.  I&#x27;m Asian and have fair colored skin.  When I don&#x27;t use sunscreen, I get red fast and get sunburned easily.  SPF 40 did the job, and I did not get sunburned in 90 degree heat working on my yard for 2 hours.  I find it does it&#x27;s job well, but might be a bit cost prohibitive to some.  It&#x27;s definitely more expensive than most sunscreens, but feels a lot nicer than the cheap stuff. Give it a try.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Really like this product.  Just a little tint, and a great primer for additional coverage if needed.  Will buy again.  Purchased because taking medicine that requires dependable sunscreen.  Spent day at the beach without even getting pink!</li>
    <li> Great product we all like it a lot and we don&#x27;t have light sensitive skin but use this all the time on our faces here in florida when outdoors at the pool on the bike or walking</li>
    <li> this is an excellent product for your face especially if you will be out in the sun. Have used this product for over two years, was  recommended to me by my doctor and it is 5 star</li>
    <li> This lotion goes on like silk and hides imperfections!</li>
    <li> I use this product after I apply moisturizer in the morning and before I apply my usual foundation and makeup. I use it almost as a primer since it reduces oil and provides me with SPF. I absolutely love the look and feel of this product, and it blends into my skin very well. I don&#x27;t necessarily need to use foundation after I apply this, but I like a fuller coverage. Although this is tinted, it does not cover blemishes very well.</li>
    <li> Silky on my skin... Not thick or tacky</li>
    <li> I have a history of skin cancer in the family, (basal cell) and I&#x27;ve done enough damage to my skin over the years.  I had a basal cell removed at 29 years old which gives you a idea of my history.  I got these in sample form from my dermatologist and i consider myself pretty knowledgable about sun screens at this stage of the game - I&#x27;ve used them all.  I also have had near accidents from sun screen migrating into my eyes which is pretty unpleasant.  I am fair skinned (tan easily) but I&#x27;m very fair.  It&#x27;s a matte finish, waterproof, do not migrate into the eyes area if applied correctly.  Also, it  fills in the deep lines in your face like a primer.  The natural skin tone is fine for my skin even though i&#x27;m fair.  I have very oily T-Zone skin, but normal except for the T-Zone.  This stuff is great and I haven&#x27;t had any problem with stinging in the eyes or break outs.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it on the beach, kayaking, playing tennis - lots of sweaty stuff and it stays put.  I use it around my eyes because that&#x27;s the place you have to be super diligent about when it comes to protecting your skin.  A tube will last me all season as I only use it on my face.  This also great for when you have to make up your face fast and you want a natural look. The coverage is amazing and flawless. I&#x27;m on my third tube!! This stuff is very waterproof and requires a makeover remover with a oily base to it. I use Pond&#x27;s Makeup Remover toilettes. It cuts thru the stuff easy and quick.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I love of how this stuff settles into deep lines and gives you a matte smooth finish. It&#x27;s one of the best line fillers/primers I&#x27;ve used. It is super water proof, does not migrate into your eyes (which I really love,) and the tinted formula gives you a subtle color. I suspect if you wanted to adjust the color, you could mix it with the colorless version as you tan waxes and wanes thru the season.  A must have for anyone concerned about protection your skin.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite face sunscreen. It is non-greasy and gives a little coverage, so I feel comfortable wearing it out without any makeup.</li>
    <li> Nice consistency.  Not greasy like other sun screens.  The color is nice with a matte finish.  Works well with or without makeup.</li>
    <li> I give this product 5 stars because I love it so much and would buy again and again.&lt;br /&gt; However, from this vendor I got a half-empty sample bottle and was very displeased.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best non-greasy sunblock. The tint is great for olive toned skin. Great protection on beach vacations and for daily use. We&#x27;ll worth the $.</li>
    <li> Not much skin tone tint in this product, but it goes on very smooth, does not irritate my skin at all, and was recommended by my Dermatologist.  No chemicals!!!  I like it for the price.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen.  It feels good, looks good and works!!  You can&#x27;t go wrong here.  I used it all last summer.</li>
    <li> It looks brown but goes on almost invisible. I would recommend it to all. There is a lighter shade also</li>
    <li> Cotz Face is a wonderful product that I recently found out about and love the way it feels on your face.  Great product.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I love it!  It goes on smoothly and is like make-up.  It covers uneven coloring in my face and I have been in the sun for hours and did not get burned.  My dermatologist recommended it.</li>
    <li> For my skin this blends in so that even if not even coverage it does not show.  Seems to be a great sunscreen for the face.</li>
    <li> For years I have been looking for a make up for my face that had a higher SPF sunscreen in it than typical cosmetics.  I have used the COTZ 58 sunblock for over 10 years on the rest of my skin and it&#x27;s great as a total sunblock, but it can&#x27;t pass for makeup because it&#x27;s pasty looking.  This COTZ Face Natural Skin Tone is beautiful!  It&#x27;s skin toned and goes on liquid, yet feels powdery soft.  It leaves a mat finish to the face, is not oily but is not dry, and is easy to apply blush, eye shadow, etc. over.  It works exactly like other high end face makeups but has an SPF 40 sunblock in it, so it&#x27;s perfect for our Florida sun.  I highly recommend it and am so glad I finally found a beautiful face make up with such great sunblock protection.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Very light and easy to apply.  I am going to wear it even when not in the direct sunlight.  Feels so good on my face.  I love it</li>
    <li> Love the fact that I don&#x27;t even need to add makeup over this.</li>
    <li> I love this.  It protects but is beautiful on the face.  Makes your skin look so smooth.  I actually use it as a makeup and mix a primer with it.  And it lasts all day for work.</li>
    <li> This product is tinted, it looks quite dark when it comes out of the tube but appears a lot lighter on skin. The tint helps with seeing where it has been applied and gives a nice base to my powder foundation (I have quite light skin). The formulation is light and silky and blended well into my skin. I apply it after serum and face cream/moisturizer. Its still very cold where I live so I have not been spending a lot of time outside. I am looking forward to seeing how this holds up in the summer.</li>
    <li> I really had high hopes for this product  but it&#x27;s not for someone with a dark skin tone it made me look ashy and washed out I wish there were more tints to try</li>
    <li> This sunscreen works really well with just a slight tint.</li>
    <li> I really like the way this feels on my skin. When I wear it people tell me my skin looks amazing. It doesn&#x27;t look like makeup, just natural.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen feels wonderful , the texture is smooth and it just glides on your skin. I can wear it and do not need to wear foundation!!!</li>
    <li> Cotz face SPF is a great sunscreen as well as a wonderful makeup primer. My skin in sensitive and this product has created no issues. I managed to get my daughter to use it buy raving about the primer aspect. At 23, it was time for a sun worshipper to use something on her face, and as I suspected she is a believer and uses it daily. I have even used it without foundation and loved the look. Excellent choice for sunscreen!</li>
    <li> Not the coverage I was expecting, but  I like the velvety feeling it leaves</li>
    <li> Is very easy to put and use not greasy at all , the color this have&lt;br /&gt;fit so good in my skin , no smells , come on time</li>
    <li> Have fought skin cancer for over 30 years. This has been the best sunscreen I have found to date. I have tried them all to date.</li>
    <li> I had a bad reaction to some more common sunscreens.  With different active ingredients than many other products, this one does the trick.  It also smoothes out my skin, wearing like a light, silky foundation.</li>
    <li> I bought this at the suggestion of my dermatologist. The texture is surprisingly smooth and silky, so it glides right on and feels great!! I love that it is tinted, and come summer I plan to wear ONLY this (no foundation) when going to the pool! Also, even though the tube is small, it lasts for a surprisingly long time!! I&#x27;ll probably go through a lot more in the summer when I&#x27;m outside more often, though. I definitely suggest getting this on subscribe and save! It&#x27;s much cheaper on Amazon than in my local Ulta Beauty store! Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> If you have medium to dark skin and want the look of a tan, this might work for you. I, however, have fair skin and read it blends in fine on fair skin. Well, it looks orange on me and basically is orange. I know they have one for fair skin but I read it&#x27;s too white. I&#x27;m returning this and getting the fair one.</li>
    <li> I work at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park and I am in the hot sun all year long, for 8 hours a day five days a week. I see how many keepers that have been there for years have had major effects of the sun. As a 28 year old woman with olive Native American/Caucasian skin. I don&#x27;t have a lot of issues with sunburning but I have started to notice sun spots on my face and I have a family history of cancer so I want to do what I can to prevent it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a sample of this Sunscreen in a purchase I made from beauty bar. I had never heard of the brand before and was very skeptical because I usually HATE facial sunscreens. They are always so heavy and greasy and I can feel them on my skin. I dislike how it feels like my skin can&#x27;t breath. I know with my job I need to wear sunscreen so I have tried many kinds. Right before getting this sample I got a facial sunscreen from Clinique and Bare Minerals. Both of witch I was not crazy about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I put Cotz face on my finger I was like EWW. It was brown and kind of grainy looking. I started applying it to my face and was instantly surprised by the way it glided on with a satin like finish. It did have a tint, but as I blinded it in, it evened out my skin tone and gave me a beautiful matte finish. The way the light reflected off the product gave me a flawless look. My first thoughts where that I loved it. I kept using this everyday for a week always reapplying in the middle of the day as you should :) Before finishing the sample I started to hunt it down and found it at my local ULTA. It was $19.19 and for a sunscreen that worked better than(Clinique, Bare Minerals, Mary Kay, Neutrogena, Aveno, H2O+, and many others)I think that is a great price. It also find that you don&#x27;t need much. I use maybe a peanut size amount. Maybe that isn&#x27;t up to other sunscreens recommended amounts but for this stuff you can tell it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now been using COTZ for a month. I love that it is an SPF 40 and it isn&#x27;t greasy and it BREATHS!! I sweat a lot in the sun and it never runs or gets in my eyes. I always have flushed cheeks when I am hot so I though it was normal but as soon as I started using COTZ my cheeks chilled out and are never flushed. Because this is a physical barrier mineral based sunscreen my face actually feels cooler in the hot sun. I tan really easily but so far this spring I have noticed that while using this product my skin has stayed fair and my dark spots are dead in there tracks. For me, because I don&#x27;t want to accelerate my aging, this is a good thing. I love that it has no fragrance. I know it isn&#x27;t supposed to be a foundation but I find it gives my skin such a nice look that I just need to add blush and eye makeup and I feel ready to go for a night out. If I am feeling extra crazy maybe some couture and highlight to tone up that tan I am now not getting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the locker room when I am putting it on I am always getting friends to try it and they all love it too. I Highly recommend this product :)</li>
    <li> I like that this has a matte finish and doesn&#x27;t have the sheen that a lot of the BB creams.</li>
    <li> I love it because it is not greasy like so many other sunscreens. It offers good protection for the&lt;br /&gt;face and can be used as makeup if you get the tinted kind.</li>
    <li> In this product &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34; Skin tone means dark skin tone. Even with a summer tan it was way too dark for my skin. It cannot be retuned if opened to try.</li>
    <li> best face sunscreen. I have acne-prone, sensitive skin. This does not break me out or irritate my skin. The subtle tint evens out my skin tone. Some days I will just wear this and set it with a light dusting of powder. I will never use any other sunscreen.</li>
    <li> This is definitely too dark for your average skin tone.  I would recommend this product for someone who is darker complected.  It made my face look like I had a bad bronzer on.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this one. great quality and good price.</li>
    <li> Excellent sunscreen and color tone.</li>
    <li> Good product but not for fair skin tones- turned too orange on light skin. Nice matte finish.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this sun block for my face! I have very sensitive skin and every other brand I have tried would make my face very dry and flaky. I get really bad dark sunspots on my face so I need something that I can use every day without irritation and this works perfectly!! I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Easy to apply.  No white residue as from the standard sun screen.  Works well.</li>
    <li> Honestly, the only way to get me to wear facial SPF is through makeup--and that&#x27;s generally only 15 SPF so this was something I wanted to try. And it works as advertised. It&#x27;s not greasy or oily, it goes on smoothly, there&#x27;s no strange smell, and amazingly, the tint worked for me (I&#x27;d say I have a medium skin tone). I did, of course, put some mineral powder over it, but I felt good knowing I was really protected. However, for the price, I typically only use it on days when I know I will be outside in full sun.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I&#x27;ve started using it after two C02 Facial Lazer treatments.  My skin is so sensitive now I can not even be in the sun more than 5-10 minutes or my face will burn with the other Sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried.  This feels great going on and is not too oily.  I have normal to dry skin.  The color is subtle also.</li>
    <li> Great product! I love that it&#x27;s tinted sunscreen, and it leaves my skin soft as well.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen! It has an amazing satin finish and feels so so so soft and smooth on your face. I have fair/light skin and this blends into my skin very well, it dosn&#x27;t look un-natural or dark. It makes makeup go on smoother and blend more easily. It dosn&#x27;t make my combo skin shiny through out the day. One of my favorite beauty products ever!</li>
    <li> Lovely coverage and never greasy!  Protects like a dream on hot summer runs!</li>
    <li> Great protection for your face. Works well as your base makeup.</li>
    <li> This is an ok product. Very thick mousse-like consistency. Not a great color match, it&#x27;s a little grey on my light olive skin and the color has actually been lightened - I preferred it slightly darker. It also transfers like crazy. Doesn&#x27;t break me out at all.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!! It goes on like silk, isn&#x27;t heavy or greasy. I use it everyday!</li>
    <li> Perfect sunscreen and primer all creamed into one.</li>
    <li> Such a great option for the days out in the sun. It has a great tint to allow me to feel comfortable not wearing make up.</li>
    <li> I have used many suncreens. Even oil-free ones often made my skin produce a lot of oil and I would look slick by 10 a.m. I have very fair skin and the first time I used this I wondered whose skin tone it would match, certainly not mine. I tried it anyway and I believe the purpose of the tinting is to help you to see it to apply it evenly because it is no longer visible when it is absorbed and dry. I highly recommend trying this. It is reasonably priced. It has not irritated my sensitive skin or made me itch. Foundation does not glide on as easily with this, but it lasts longer and gives better coverage because there is less slip with Cotz. I tried because I got a free sample of it but I had never heard of Cotz before.</li>
    <li> My chiropractor had samples.  I wear a tinted moisturizer as a base and wanted to find a new one.  My chiropractor loves products and had a box of these samples because she loves it.  I liked it immediately.  My face looks smooth and even.  I have fair skin and the color blends, might be a little off in winter though, we&#x27;ll see. I feel safe with the spf 40 just going about my day.  Sometimes I add a little moisturizer to thin it out, it&#x27;s a pretty thick product, and it&#x27;s great.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Good sun protection, but wasnt too helpful with my oily skin. I gave it to my mom with dry skin.</li>
    <li> I like this product beI like this product because it does what it is supposed to do: protect your skin from the sun, particularly the face. What I think I like most is how it blends in the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave that white \\&quot;film\\&quot; that many lotions leave behind, mostly because it is not white, but more of a bronze/brown colour. I am white - fair skin, but have a slight [very slight] olive tint to my complexion - and most sun protection creams and lotions leave my skin feeling greasy and oilier than before. This protection does NOT leave my skin feeling oily or slimy/grimy, sticky, leaves no smears or left behind bits of stuff on my face. I enjoy using it on face and neck during the sun-filled months and I like how I don&#x27;t have to use that much - always a plus in my book: a little that goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There isn&#x27;t anything I&#x27;d say that bothers me or that I feel is a negative. I do perceive some being bothered by the texture, at least initially. It doesn&#x27;t have the same super-smooth texture that most commercial sun blocks have, but rather has a thicker consistency and more of a grainy feel, but doesn&#x27;t cause an irritant feeling when rubbed on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a nice compact and easy to carry around with you in your purse or small beach bag (wherever it is that you keep it when going on an outing). It doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;explode\\&quot; or go everywhere when it becomes super hot and becomes pure liquid (like I&#x27;ve seen with so many other sun block lotions after you open it and it&#x27;s been in high temperatures for some time). I really would recommend this and actually tried offering some to my roommates at the time (when I first received it and started using it in summer and for the duration of that summer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily rave about this product, but I would not put it down in any way. I don&#x27;t remember one problem of concern or discontentment I had. I plan on continuing to use it for as long as I can for those sunny, summer months. :)</li>
    <li> If you have oily skin and would like to have a &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; finish at the end of a hot day (I live in Houston, TX), use this product.  Plus you get the bonus of having sun screen to help protect your skin.  This product will be a must for me.</li>
    <li> I like this sunscreen. It can be a bit drying on my cheeks and under the eyes. I just put moisturizer on those areas and let it sink in before applying the suncreen. Then just a little bit of concealer on my red areas and powder on top with a bit of blush. Very easy summer look. The suncreen actually looks better as the day goes on. It does look dark coming out of the tube but is not dark on the skin.Will purchase again.</li>
</ol>
