### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>quality of this set of hair products are excellent - they feed and give vitamins to the hair and scalp and also prevent hair lost.</li>
      <li>Nexxus Phyto Organics Shampoo and Conditioner is the best product I have ever used.</li>
      <li>The was the best price I&#x27;ve seen for the pair.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to find an affordable organic shampoo and this is perfect!</li>
      <li>Very happy!</li>
      <li>This product is very good on my hair.  </li>
      <li>feel it is a very good value.</li>
      <li>and I gave it a chance and been happy ever since, the nectaress  is just the s</li>
      <li>Then chances of leak could be greatly lessen - unless forwarders on both sides - are not keen to adhere to instructions - which is something out of our control.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used nexxus conditioner before which worked wonders on my hair, so i figured this product would be great - NO...</li>
      <li>honestly, save yourself the money and get a better hairwash with suave or herbal essence!</li>
      <li>yes the packaging was nice, came with styrofoam peanuts to cushion the bottles, and tape on top of the pumps to prevent leaking...</li>
      <li>Now I&#x27;ll be more apt to purchase from this vendor over others</li>
      <li>The shampoo is great for cleansing without weighing down the hair and it has a wonderful fragrance.</li>
      <li>The price is great and it came right away.  </li>
      <li>I have very fine hair, I washed my hair twice using this product.  </li>
      <li>BUT the shampoo and conditioner smell very chemical-y and did NOTHING to soften, moisturize or do any GOOD for my hair!</li>
      <li>I am thankful that I am able to find it elsewhere.</li>
      <li>Company followed up with email to make sure we were satisfied.  </li>
      <li>love it and will order again.</li>
      <li>I love this set of shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>and she loves it and ask me to order her some more</li>
      <li>This is my favorite hair product but my salon stopped carrying it.</li>
      <li>It keeps my hair looking healthy and</li>
      <li>Never makes my hair greasy or flat and did I mention that it smells great!!</li>
      <li>Love the stuff, smells great, makes my hair shiny and soft.</li>
      <li>The Nectaress conditioner is a good detangler for all types of hair and has a very pleasing fragrance.</li>
      <li>It was fine.</li>
      <li>These hair products are amazing on my hair, its superior to any hair pruducts ive ued, and always leaves my hair super soft and smells really really really good, especially the conditioner</li>
      <li>The Nexxus Phyto Organics duo, shampoo and light conditioner, are spa quality products.</li>
      <li>so I have to use a light weight conditioner, this is it.</li>
      <li>My hair is soft, feels cleans and smells good.</li>
      <li>I really only wanted the conditioner, but the shampoo is also very nice.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Excellent product for fine hair, full volume shampoo and light weight conditioner</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used them before and was excited by the value size and price.</li>
      <li>Excellent price for the duo package, these deals are hard to fine.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Luckily I still had the pumps from the bottles I finished and put them on it instead.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d purchased this locally and liked it, so about Dec 2012</li>
      <li>i am not too picky about my hair products, but i do invest a little more in conditioners to help keep my hair healthy.</li>
      <li>THANKS!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and the conditioner is super soft and silky! :)</li>
      <li>After using my scalp had been very itchy and I have flaking.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo and conditioner really cleans your hair.  </li>
      <li>and Inergy is a decent shampoo ...</li>
      <li>- i.e. the bottles have to be packed upright and indication on the box clearly in BIG BOLD LETTERS :-  </li>
      <li>However it is very professional and ethical of Amazon to refund the US$60/- as a goodwill gesture for leaking products.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using  Moroccan Oil Hair Treatment for years and normally need two pumps ...</li>
      <li>Have highlighted hair and dry thick hair, always looks great using this product.  </li>
      <li>After years of using over-the-counter shampoos and conditioners that flattened and dried out my hair, I discovered I now have beautiful, natural curls using this product recommended by my hairdresser a few months ago.</li>
      <li>Arrived earlier than expected &amp; my daughter is pleased.  </li>
      <li>makes your hair soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never seen my dyed hair have such intense color so long after dying, and my natural color is much lighter now.</li>
      <li>But like always when I attempt to explain the possible leak - the new supplier will always assure me without listening to what I have to say thus resulting in another &amp;#34;leaky&amp;#34; delivery.  </li>
      <li>My hair at middle age is now young and vibrant-despite years of coloring.</li>
      <li>My hair stylist recommended this brand to keep dyed red hair red and my natural blonde hair blonde.</li>
      <li>They have also changed the ingredinets (not sure what exactly because my old bottles have been thrown away) but my hair is DRY and feels horrible.&lt;br</li>

<li> My hair has never grown very long and it is now longer then it ever has been.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t make my hair too dry or too oily.</li>
<li> Like in this case, if Amazon had listen, and if the forwarding company also heed my words, something could have been done to prevent the leak and therefore bottles could have been received dry and no refund is required.  </li>
<li> My hair is thick and heavy, it goes flat fast</li>
<li> I ordered a few months ago again and it doesn&#x27;t smell the same...</li>
<li> AS I have been  buying this set of shampoo and conditioner from other sellers and on all past occasions the bottles came leaking.  </li>
<li> Not too heavy and greasy.</li>
<li> it dried out my hair</li>
<li> I had trouble with the pumps on both the Nexxus shampoo and the conditioner</li>
<li> One of the pumps was a little hard to loosen and start using, but nothing a little elbow grease couldn&#x27;t fix.</li>
<li> I am not sure what I need to do because my shampoo was opened when I received it</li>
<li> at least so my hair isn&#x27;t like a bush.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> seriously... how did people think this is spa quality?</li>
<li> so false.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll never buy another Nexxus product online because it&#x27;s too difficult to return.</li>
<li> Disappointing.</li>
<li> they&#x27;ve radically changed the scent and it stinks to me.</li>
<li> will never buy this crap again.</li>
<li> I am very disappointed in this product.  </li>
<li> The worst part of using this product is I&#x27;m allergic to it!  </li>

    <li> seriously... how did people think this is spa quality? yes the packaging was nice, came with styrofoam peanuts to cushion the bottles, and tape on top of the pumps to prevent leaking... BUT the shampoo and conditioner smell very chemical-y and did NOTHING to soften, moisturize or do any GOOD for my hair! i am not too picky about my hair products, but i do invest a little more in conditioners to help keep my hair healthy. I&#x27;ve used nexxus conditioner before which worked wonders on my hair, so i figured this product would be great - NO... it dried out my hair and i can&#x27;t stand the smell. i used it maybe twice and now it&#x27;s just taking up space in my bathroom. i&#x27;ll probably throw it out. honestly, save yourself the money and get a better hairwash with suave or herbal essence!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years. Love the stuff, smells great, makes my hair shiny and soft. My hair is thick and heavy, it goes flat fast so I have to use a light weight conditioner, this is it. Never makes my hair greasy or flat and did I mention that it smells great!!</li>
    <li> These hair products are amazing on my hair, its superior to any hair pruducts ive ued, and always leaves my hair super soft and smells really really really good, especially the conditioner</li>
    <li> The container pumps were taped, so that none of the product escaped the bottles.  The was the best price I&#x27;ve seen for the pair.  I really only wanted the conditioner, but the shampoo is also very nice.  Product was delivered as promised and was on time.</li>
    <li> AS I have been  buying this set of shampoo and conditioner from other sellers and on all past occasions the bottles came leaking.  But like always when I attempt to explain the possible leak - the new supplier will always assure me without listening to what I have to say thus resulting in another &amp;#34;leaky&amp;#34; delivery.  Like in this case, if Amazon had listen, and if the forwarding company also heed my words, something could have been done to prevent the leak and therefore bottles could have been received dry and no refund is required.  However it is very professional and ethical of Amazon to refund the US$60/- as a goodwill gesture for leaking products.  I will still be ordering in the future and hopefully someone in Amazon LISTEN to what I have to say regarding packaging - i.e. the bottles have to be packed upright and indication on the box clearly in BIG BOLD LETTERS :-  THIS SIDE UP.  Then chances of leak could be greatly lessen - unless forwarders on both sides - are not keen to adhere to instructions - which is something out of our control.  (think leak is also because of the pump - perhaps the normal cap should be screwed on tight and the pump is packed separate).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of this set of hair products are excellent - they feed and give vitamins to the hair and scalp and also prevent hair lost.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner really cleans your hair.  The scent also helps wake you up in the morning.  This is the only product my teenage son will use.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a couple of year. My hair has never grown very long and it is now longer then it ever has been. I bought some for my daughter to try and she loves it and ask me to order her some more</li>
    <li> This product is very good on my hair.  It keeps my hair looking healthy and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;I feel it is a very good value.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d purchased this locally and liked it, so about Dec 2012 I ordered from Amazon as my salon no linger carried it. It was fine. I ordered a few months ago again and it doesn&#x27;t smell the same...they&#x27;ve radically changed the scent and it stinks to me. I&#x27;m highly chemically sensitive so this sucks. They have also changed the ingredinets (not sure what exactly because my old bottles have been thrown away) but my hair is DRY and feels horrible.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using  Moroccan Oil Hair Treatment for years and normally need two pumps ... I need 5-6 at least so my hair isn&#x27;t like a bush.&lt;br /&gt;I will never buy this crap again.</li>
    <li> Daughter loves this stuff. Very happy!</li>
    <li> I love this set of shampoo and conditioner. I&#x27;ve used them before and was excited by the value size and price. One of the pumps was a little hard to loosen and start using, but nothing a little elbow grease couldn&#x27;t fix. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> makes your hair soft and shiny. love it and will order again.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist recommended this brand to keep dyed red hair red and my natural blonde hair blonde. I&#x27;ve never seen my dyed hair have such intense color so long after dying, and my natural color is much lighter now. Doesn&#x27;t make my hair too dry or too oily.</li>
    <li> Excellent price for the duo package, these deals are hard to fine.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product for fine hair, full volume shampoo and light weight conditioner</li>
    <li> I was a Paul Mitchell user till it went from the salon to every where.. then Phyto organics came to the salon and I gave it a chance and been happy ever since, the nectaress  is just the s*** for a conditioner and Inergy is a decent shampoo ...</li>
    <li> The Nexxus Phyto Organics duo, shampoo and light conditioner, are spa quality products. The shampoo is great for cleansing without weighing down the hair and it has a wonderful fragrance. The Nectaress conditioner is a good detangler for all types of hair and has a very pleasing fragrance. I have used both products for a long time.</li>
    <li> I am not sure what I need to do because my shampoo was opened when I received it and it was he&#x27;ll cleaning it up</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair product but my salon stopped carrying it. I am thankful that I am able to find it elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Both of these items are packed with harmful chemicals like sodium laureth sulfate and artificial dyes among many others--the ingredients list reads like the inventory of a science lab. Yes, there are organic ingredients, but what&#x27;s the point with everything else that&#x27;s in there?</li>
    <li> The price is great and it came right away.  I had trouble with the pumps on both the Nexxus shampoo and the conditioner and they would not work.  Luckily I still had the pumps from the bottles I finished and put them on it instead.</li>
    <li> This product is NOT organic...shame on them making you think it is by calling it phyto organics. They should be made to change their label ...so false.</li>
    <li> Disappointing. Not organic. Left my hair flat and lifeless. Doesn&#x27;t lather up well and I don&#x27;t like the smell. I would not buy this product.</li>
    <li> Have highlighted hair and dry thick hair, always looks great using this product.  Not too heavy and greasy.</li>

    <li> Bought this for our daughter &amp; had shipped to her dorm. Arrived earlier than expected &amp; my daughter is pleased.  Company followed up with email to make sure we were satisfied.  Going above &amp; beyond for customer service. Now I&#x27;ll be more apt to purchase from this vendor over others</li>
    <li> Nexxus Phyto Organics Shampoo and Conditioner is the best product I have ever used. I have been trying to find a high quality shampoo and conditioner, needless to say I have spent over 300.00 dollars trying to find a product that is worth the buck. This is it! I will never seek another product. My hair is soft, feels cleans and smells good. THANKS!</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed in this product.  I bought it thinking I needed a change from my current product.  I&#x27;ve been using biolage for about a year.  I have very fine hair, I washed my hair twice using this product.  After each wash my hair was very flat and lifeless.  It would not style at all.  The worst part of using this product is I&#x27;m allergic to it!  After using my scalp had been very itchy and I have flaking.  I&#x27;ve never had dandruff in my life!  I do not recomend this product to anyone.  Will be going back to biolage.</li>
