    <li> Item was as described, i love curve so i got this for a friend and she too loved it.&lt;br /&gt;As described and as expected, Reccommednded!!!&lt;br /&gt;Shipped in a timely manner</li>
    <li> I first purchased the 3.4 oz bottle of this perfume about 3 years ago.  I wear it on occassion and always get compliments that it smells \\&quot;sexy.\\&quot; I feel it&#x27;s a tad strong and almost masculine smelling but something rounds it off to soften it up a bit.  Not my fave but it does last all day with just a few squirts of the bottle.  Since I get compliments on it, I know it doesn&#x27;t stink on me so I can deal with my miner dislikes for a scent that lasts all day.  I prefer to wear it in the winter months.  A little to heavy for summer.</li>
    <li> very strong and pungent, lasts all day. an all right scent  Curve Kicks By Liz Claiborne for Women Eau De Toilette Spray, 3.4-Ounce Bottle]]</li>
    <li> Very nice gift for girlfriend.  Sweet n sexy scent</li>
    <li> Love this perfume. It was pretty cheap and arrived in great time with excellent packaging. Wished it lasted longer but I have never owned a perfume that did last all day. It is strong but not overpowering by any means. Many compliments when wearing.</li>
    <li> i ordered this for my moms b-day, she loves curve, its a pretty big bottle for the price an smells good though not as good as some the other curve , kind of strong though it does stay on your clothes an wears down a little thoughout the day, mom likes it an thats what counts</li>
    <li> This spray smells SO good! Definately will purchase again! Very soft plesent smell. I would recommend this to another person any day.</li>

I&#x27;m glad to be able to still find it as I love all of the Liz Claiborne curve products and some of them are hard to find in retail stores.</li>
    <li> The smell dose not meet curve standards. Cheap but hate the smell.</li>
    <li> Excellent 100% Recommended</li>
    <li> Curve Kicks begins with top notes of mandarin, watery pear, melon, and cassis . Heart notes of passion fruit, peony, freesia and muguet rest atop creamy base notes of vanilla, peach, sandalwood, vetiver and cedar. The fragrance is long-lasting, 8-10 hours I&#x27;d say, and I receive compliments from both men and women whenever I wear it.</li>
    <li> Good price, and I love it!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, quality product.</li>
    <li> This was a \\&quot;just because\\&quot; gift for my wife. She really liked it and the packaging. And I like the fragrance. Win win!!</li>
    <li> This product smells so good and it is a big bottle, the only this is that most of the curves say on the tin can if its for women or men and this one does not really say anything although it seems you can use this one as unisex. which i think is pretty cool. I still gave it to my son and he loves it.</li>
    <li> was a gift for my mom, she loved it!</li>
    <li> It arrived on time, packaging was in excellent condition, it is new as stated, I&#x27;m just not too sure about the smell.....surely it is real just haven&#x27;t bought in years lol</li>
    <li> A bit sweet, but I like it.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a xmas gift for my daughter who claims is hard to find.  Amazon is usually my first choice for online purchases, so I was happy to find this at a great price too. Smells nice to me! :)</li>
    <li> This has a strong fragrance, almost masculine at first.  I love it.  I like all of Curve perfumes!  Kicks smells like a good deodorant should smell.  I wish they made a Curve deodorant!</li>
    <li> I just love love this scent Liz has done it again ..and the price was great I will be getting more from here...</li>
    <li> Great price for a big bottle!  Smells great! I usually wear Curve Crush (one of my favorites), but I couldn&#x27;t pass up on this deal! It has a musky smell to it, but not too strong. The only drawback is the smell does not last long at all. But totally worth the price. I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I had a little gift collection size of this and when I finally got around to using it I just about died. This is a great scent. It&#x27;s sweet, addictive, slightly musky/heavy yet smells clean at the same time. It does not last too long, the heaviness anyway, after around 2 hrs you are left with a very lite scent trailing you. Which is nice because I hate feeling like someone&#x27;s perfume is drowning me as they walk by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been trying different scents for about a year now trying to find one I would like. THIS IS IT!&lt;br /&gt;Someone mentioned men or women could wear it but honestly I find it way too sweet for men.</li>
    <li> I brought it for my wife and she loves it. And it also came with a bath gel, so i could&#x27;t have a greater deal!!!</li>
    <li> This is just ok...smells kind of like cheap mens cologne..however my Mom likes it so...pretty good bargain. Came quickly and in good condition.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t care for the smell</li>
    <li> Simply love this perfume</li>
    <li> I was only able to find this scent on Amazon.  Receive many compliments when wearing it.  It&#x27;s got a nice light spicy aroma.</li>
    <li> My husband likes the smell, and it&#x27;s good! (recommend to use in the night)&lt;br /&gt;However, soon the scent is gone, two hour left....</li>
    <li> The perfume purchased is a quality product, in accordance with the fragrances used my wives. Besides that adequate time remains on the skin. I recommend it for its quality and suitable price</li>
    <li> Great I love it came fast and smells great</li>
