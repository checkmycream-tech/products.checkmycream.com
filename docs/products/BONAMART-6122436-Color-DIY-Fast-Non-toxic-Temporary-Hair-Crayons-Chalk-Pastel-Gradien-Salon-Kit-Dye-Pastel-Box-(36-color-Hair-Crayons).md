      <li>I love my chalk :)</li>
      <li>I use them on my daughters hair, and love that there are so many colors to choose from.</li>
      <li>and I love the colours.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>For a whopping $10 you get much more that you pay for.</li>
      <li>I love that it is so easy to use &amp; the fact that I don&#x27;t even have to diy my hair.</li>
      <li>These chalks work best on wet, combed hair.</li>
      <li>These are fun to use but don&#x27;t really show up that great.</li>
      <li>It wipes off incredibly easily, so don&#x27;t brush it at all after putting it in.</li>

      <li>Thank you so much to whoever made this product, I love it, it makes my hair so beautifully colorfully!  </li>
      <li>Is fun to use.</li>
      <li>Doesnt show up very easily, even on my blonde tips (ombre hair style).</li>
      <li>this item was exactly what i wanted and was shipped right away</li>
      <li>good price, lots of color and color stays well if you just a little hair spray to seal it.  </li>
      <li>The colors are so vibrant and pretty, and my friends like it too!</li>
      <li>I purchased these for my daughter and she didn&#x27;t have a positive experience with this chalk.</li>
      <li>haha.</li>
      <li>I have bleach blond in my hair so the color really popped and it lasts a while too.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t take too much time to use.</li>
      <li>Applying to wet hair worked much better but still tangled.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t worker really well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really happy with this chalk, but it does make your hair feel a little dry</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t come with instructions, but the chalk itself is easy to use (just wet hair before applying) and provides vibrant color.</li>
      <li>just make sure your hair is at least a bit wet and the chalk comes right off, on to your hair, easily.</li>
      <li>I like the variety of colors and even though they&#x27;re chalky and dry out your hair, they are absolutely fun to use!</li>
      <li>The only problem is that it it isn&#x27;t strong enough to be seen</li>
      <li>One stand had the same exact hair product as this, so I asked them how to use it</li>
      <li>but I have to grab about 20 strands of hair and brush it smooth and wet it and rub the hair chalk on it about twenty times (in ONE DIRECTION ONLY) for it to show.</li>
      <li>and it made her hair feel dry and very tangly.</li>
      <li>I can only do 4 strands total / occasion because it&#x27;s too much work.</li>
      <li>And careful not to touch it too much, it wipes off.</li>

    <li> My daughter has incredibly thick, almost black hair. This kind of works. The pink, and some blues work - but I have to grab about 20 strands of hair and brush it smooth and wet it and rub the hair chalk on it about twenty times (in ONE DIRECTION ONLY) for it to show. It wipes off incredibly easily, so don&#x27;t brush it at all after putting it in. And careful not to touch it too much, it wipes off. I can only do 4 strands total / occasion because it&#x27;s too much work. The yellow looks like she has grey/white hairs haha. So, I wish I&#x27;d just bought one pink and one blue.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t worker really well. Tried it with dry hair and wet hair.</li>
    <li> Well, I&#x27;m not giving it 4 stars, because I just knew what I wasordering. My warning is, be aware that it&#x27;s a bit hard to apply on dark hair. mine is dark brown #2. And while you apply this, it might get on your clothes. If you have short hair like me, (bob hair) than you won&#x27;t get your clothes dirty, but long hair with make your clothes covered in chalk.&lt;br /&gt;For me it&#x27;s good and I love the colours.</li>
    <li> good price, lots of color and color stays well if you just a little hair spray to seal it.  Is fun to use.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my daughter and she didn&#x27;t have a positive experience with this chalk. From the reviews we read you are supposed to put it on when your hair is wet. My daughter did that and when she started to style her hair, the chalk got on everything and it made her hair feel dry and very tangly. Not sure if we applied it right because there were no directions, but read the other reviews and followed their advice. It just didn&#x27;t work for my daughter.</li>
    <li> My daughter wanted her hair to be pastel rainbow colored. I wanted it to not be permanent. These hair chalks fit the bill. They are easy to use and wash off of skin easily with a baby wipe or moist washcloth. The gloves and cape that come with the kit are a joke. Don&#x27;t bother with them. Just wear a pair of latex or nitrile gloves and throw on a junkie t-shirt. These chalks work best on wet, combed hair. The only thing I disliked about these is that they have a bit of a smell. I don&#x27;t know how to describe it, but its kind of yucky. Hair products afterward are a must to mask the smell. Other than that its a great, easy to use, product. I would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> A little difficult to apply without creating snarls in hair. Applying to wet hair worked much better but still tangled.</li>
    <li> I have bleach blond in my hair so the color really popped and it lasts a while too. I&#x27;m really happy with this chalk, but it does make your hair feel a little dry but the color doesn&#x27;t brush out. It does take a bit of work to color my hair with it but thats alright it makes my hair eye catching. I love my chalk :)</li>
    <li> this item was exactly what i wanted and was shipped right away and i got it before christmas so i could give it for a present</li>
    <li> Perfect...just use gloves...on WET hair and dry style</li>
    <li> These are co but not good if you have dark hair for blonde Id deff buy it</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t come with instructions, but the chalk itself is easy to use (just wet hair before applying) and provides vibrant color.</li>
    <li> This item is great.&lt;br /&gt;It can be used for a fun night out, or if you&#x27;re bored, you can just use it for something to do. The chalk is about 1 1/2 in. long each, and about 1 cm. wide. They don&#x27;t take too much time to use. For setup, it&#x27;s about 5 minutes, maybe not even that. I would recommend this to anyone who loves colored hair, but doesn&#x27;t want to dye it permanently. I would even buy it again.</li>
    <li> everything was in place and no cracks. The only problem is that it it isn&#x27;t strong enough to be seen</li>
    <li> So, when these arrived, I was so exited to open them. There were no instructions or anything, but I didn&#x27;t care. I started rubbing it on my hair, but nothing was showing up. I was so disappointed and felt like I wasted my money to get 34 of these chalks. A few days later, I was at my town carnival, and some of the high schoolers set up stands to decorate cupcakes and dip dye hair. One stand had the same exact hair product as this, so I asked them how to use it and you just have to wet your hair. I didn&#x27;t know this because I have other ones where u can use dry hair. The colors are so vibrant and pretty, and my friends like it too! I totally recommend this!!!! Great product!!</li>
    <li> Doesnt show up very easily, even on my blonde tips (ombre hair style). To get it to show up at all you must wet your hair.</li>
    <li> Wonderful little scale.  I love this product. It was cheap and delivered in a timely matter undamaged.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much to whoever made this product, I love it, it makes my hair so beautifully colorfully!  Love love love it!</li>
    <li> These are awesome. I use them on my daughters hair, and love that there are so many colors to choose from. Wet hair a little, rub on, and flat iron or blow dry. They stay in for a bout a day or two.</li>
    <li> Fun for a day or just to test colors, but really sloppy gets chalk all over ur clothes and it does stain!</li>
    <li> i had to be keith urban for a chool version of american idol at my kids&#x27; school. my wife put blond streaks in my hair (i have fairly dark hair) in minutes. just make sure your hair is at least a bit wet and the chalk comes right off, on to your hair, easily.</li>
    <li> I like the variety of colors and even though they&#x27;re chalky and dry out your hair, they are absolutely fun to use! Love it!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t beat the price. For a whopping $10 you get much more that you pay for. I love that it is so easy to use &amp; the fact that I don&#x27;t even have to diy my hair. Love the look.</li>
    <li> Did not work on my dark colored hair. Applied pressure with the hope that some color would be transferred...doing so was a complete waste of my time.</li>
    <li> These are fun to use but don&#x27;t really show up that great.</li>
