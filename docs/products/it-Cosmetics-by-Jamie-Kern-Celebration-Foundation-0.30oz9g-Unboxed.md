<ol>
    <li> Love this foundation, covers easily, and feels light</li>
    <li> I love IT foundation and usually buy on QVC but I did not need the burgs as I already received one from my first order. So I decided to check out Amazon and to my delight they had the foundation, my color and a cheaper price. I will order again.</li>
    <li> I normally use Makeup Forever HD liquid foundation which looks virtually invisible on. The IT Celebration Foundation was very heavy looking and not invisible at all. Definitely not what I expected after watching ads and demos of it. Will be returning this product.</li>
    <li> but mine arrived all dried up and is practically unusable</li>
    <li> Luv the It cosmetics, and amazon has the best price.</li>
    <li> Excellent not too made up looking.  Good coverage.</li>
    <li> Love the whole line of makeup.  Great coverage-goes on so smooth and looks so natural.  Everything about it is great.</li>
    <li> This is all I buy, nothing else compares..</li>
    <li> I love this new makeup I found via you-tube. I have already ordered a second compact. Highly recommend. Med Beige color is perfect for my fair skin.</li>
    <li> The foundation was a bit drying and makes my face itch sometimes.  My skin doesn&#x27;t react to Bare Minerals , so I will go back to that brand.</li>
    <li> Super.... As expected for this foundation!</li>
    <li> Love this makeup! I use to use bare minerals but find the coverage of It far superior and I have lots of acne scars to cover. It&#x27;s not perfect but far better that bare minerals in all day wear and coverage.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little cake-like. I guess I&#x27;m just used to TARTE. Next time, I&#x27;m buying TARTE even tho the ratings for it were bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Incidentally, I love the IT brand eyebrow pencil.... sadly, this is not it.</li>
    <li> Just does not work for me. I need a fluid.Too dry.</li>
    <li> Really like it !!  It covers great</li>
    <li> This foundation does not work with my oily skin. Doesn&#x27;t stay on at all.  Very disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> This face powder is wonderful. It doesn&#x27;t show, covers all imperfections and stays on all day. I highly recommend the It product..</li>
    <li> Caused my skin to look dry....Most of QVC&#x27;s beauty products are shown on the under-50 (way under😊) models. There is a reason for that. They don&#x27;t  often &#x27;work&#x27; on older skin.  Not saying this won&#x27;t work for some of the over-50 crowd but it was was not moisturizing for me.</li>
    <li> I love the coverage I get from this product. Doesn&#x27;t cake up or crack.</li>
    <li> I have found that It products are so easy and fast to apply. Stay on all day and I love that it doesn&#x27;t appear to look like a mask on my face!</li>
    <li> Love it great coverage never dry or flakey sue p.</li>
    <li> Did not receive this for a long time but it is a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I decided to change from this product to another loose powder that I used for years. This one was too dark for my skin and really accentuated my lines, wrinkles and large pores. The other product is perfect for my skin color, but also accentuates my lines and wrinkles. Does anyone out there have a suggestion for a natural foundation without all the toxic chemicals that soften lines and wrinkles? Thank you</li>
    <li> little too dark for me..  even in light..</li>
    <li> WORKS GREAT-DOES NOT CAKE ON YOUR FACE</li>
