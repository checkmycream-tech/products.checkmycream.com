### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>THAT mitt was wonderful,</li>
      <li>this is actually a good mitt!</li>
      <li>does not stink, good quality!</li>
      <li>of course I have been looking all over town and Internet for good tanning mitts!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use Dave&#x27;s Tanner, but the Mitt is great for any tanning product.</li>
      <li>My results have been much better with the glove , than without- no missed spots!!</li>
      <li>I dont find it very effective, the mitt ripped faster after couple of time usage.</li>
      <li>you have purchased a &amp;#34;Famous Dave&#x27;s&amp;#34; mitt before and loved it - THIS IS NOT</li>
      <li>Really good tan applicator.</li>
      <li>A good thing.</li>
      <li>Honestly I didn&#x27;t understand the purpose of the mitt.  </li>
      <li>THIS is  a great mitt for a perfect tan without the mess on your hands.</li>
      <li>so glad i got it.</li>
      <li>I also love the fact I don&#x27;t end up with tanning lotion all over my hands.</li>
      <li>Now I am glad.</li>
      <li>The mitt is easy to use,and it makes for a nice smooth tan.</li>
      <li>Washes easily.</li>
      <li>I would rather use rags to apply faster and worry free from rip it faster.</li>
      <li>Also easy to clean.</li>
      <li>the best I&#x27;ve ever seen, would last a long time and gave an amazingly even tan and comfortable and easy application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Blends the color well, keeps the hands clean.</li>
      <li>Be very warned this is the same cheap mitt I just bought from Walmart!!!</li>
      <li>Oh yeah, it isn&#x27;t orange either it is brown on the under-side and a royal blue on top with Dave&#x27;s name...</li>
      <li>This is my first time trying glow lotion / sunless tanner</li>
      <li>and so my first time purchasing a mitt.  </li>
      <li>I did read reviews of this one compared to a couple of others and note that this one is an actual mitt that you slide your hand into, while others are more just a sponge that you hold.</li>
      <li>Also helps to put body lotion on first , before using tanning lotion with glove.</li>
      <li>ones I used to purchase from dave were made out of a wonderful CLOTH material - a stretchy viscose on the back and a sort of thick velour or synthetic suede on the application side.  </li>
      <li>fits my hand, leaves no streaks,washes easily, dries fast ready for next use.</li>
      <li>very helpful for applying any self tanner--it is a must if you are applying any</li>
      <li>better than ones that i have bought in boots which feel kinda rough and fall apart - this one feels nicer on my skin</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really have anything to compare it to, so will just say that it seems to work well for its intended purpose</li>
      <li>The shipping cost is a little intimidating, but I&#x27;ll just have to pay it because I can&#x27;t get along without it:)</li>
      <li>I had to be convinced to try a mitt, but my new tanning mousse included a mitt in application directions.</li>
      <li>Mitt they are selling now, WITH THE SAME DESCRIPTION AND PRICE, is your standard variety &amp;#34;Walmart Mit&amp;#34; that comes free with some tanners, or cost $5 for three online.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>can no longer find a facsimile of the old Daves&#x27; mitt.  </li>

<li> If you wash your hands once during and after the mitt seems pointless.</li>
<li> I paid a hefty price for this and it makes me so mad!</li>

    <li> THIS is  a great mitt for a perfect tan without the mess on your hands. Totally keeps it off you hands.</li>
    <li> I dont find it very effective, the mitt ripped faster after couple of time usage. I would rather use rags to apply faster and worry free from rip it faster. Waste of money</li>
    <li> WARNING -&lt;br /&gt;If you have purchased a &amp;#34;Famous Dave&#x27;s&amp;#34; mitt before and loved it - THIS IS NOT IT.&lt;br /&gt;The ones I used to purchase from dave were made out of a wonderful CLOTH material - a stretchy viscose on the back and a sort of thick velour or synthetic suede on the application side.  And, the sides were SEWN together with a actual thread stitching!  THAT mitt was wonderful, the best I&#x27;ve ever seen, would last a long time and gave an amazingly even tan and comfortable and easy application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Mitt they are selling now, WITH THE SAME DESCRIPTION AND PRICE, is your standard variety &amp;#34;Walmart Mit&amp;#34; that comes free with some tanners, or cost $5 for three online.&lt;br /&gt;I can no longer find a facsimile of the old Daves&#x27; mitt.  If anybody knows of one, please post it!</li>
    <li> The mitt is easy to use,and it makes for a nice smooth tan.Also easy to clean.The price is reasonable,too.A good thing.</li>
    <li> this is actually a good mitt! better than ones that i have bought in boots which feel kinda rough and fall apart - this one feels nicer on my skin</li>
    <li> Blends the color well, keeps the hands clean. Washes easily. I use these every summer, it makes application so simple.</li>
    <li> I had to be convinced to try a mitt, but my new tanning mousse included a mitt in application directions. Now I am glad.</li>
    <li> Really good tan applicator.</li>
    <li> fits my hand, leaves no streaks,washes easily, dries fast ready for next use. does not stink, good quality! so glad i got it.</li>
    <li> This mitt is actually a mitt. You can put your hand inside. I haven&#x27;t used it yet. This is a quality mitt for a mitt. Oh yeah, it isn&#x27;t orange either it is brown on the under-side and a royal blue on top with Dave&#x27;s name... I also ordered the St. Tropez mitt, this is \\&quot;not\\&quot; a mitt. This one is just a sponge with nowhere to slip your hand in. Don&#x27;t think I will like that one...that&#x27;s it for now...</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold up at all! FakeBake&#x27;s tanning mitt may be more expensive but it doesn&#x27;t rip at seams. Not a fan!</li>
    <li> I had no problems using this mitt.</li>
    <li> This is my first time trying glow lotion / sunless tanner and so my first time purchasing a mitt.  I don&#x27;t really have anything to compare it to, so will just say that it seems to work well for its intended purpose and I have no complaints.  I did read reviews of this one compared to a couple of others and note that this one is an actual mitt that you slide your hand into, while others are more just a sponge that you hold.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use Dave&#x27;s Tanner, but the Mitt is great for any tanning product.</li>
    <li> very helpful for applying any self tanner--it is a must if you are applying any</li>
    <li> This allows for even coverage.</li>
    <li> I have worn this mitt out.  It lasted a long time.  I tried another manufacturer&#x27;s mitt but it was too stiff.  This mitt is thin and gets into places better (like behind ears).  The shipping cost is a little intimidating, but I&#x27;ll just have to pay it because I can&#x27;t get along without it:)</li>
    <li> Honestly I didn&#x27;t understand the purpose of the mitt.  If you wash your hands once during and after the mitt seems pointless. Also didn&#x27;t like the texture.</li>
    <li> Hello.&lt;br /&gt;So of course I have been looking all over town and Internet for good tanning mitts! Be very warned this is the same cheap mitt I just bought from Walmart!!! I paid a hefty price for this and it makes me so mad! This mitt maybe lasted me 4 applications before it tore and shredded! Be warned.</li>
    <li> Never really thought about using a glove to put on tanning lotion. It does make a difference in a couple of ways-&lt;br /&gt;goes on smoother, use less product overall, and blends products well. I also love the fact I don&#x27;t end up with tanning lotion all over my hands. It is necessary to wash this glove regularly. Also helps to put body lotion on first , before using tanning lotion with glove. My results have been much better with the glove , than without- no missed spots!!</li>
