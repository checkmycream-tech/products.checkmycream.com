      <li>Great smell that last all day and night.  </li>
      <li>I received a free gift of deodorant as well.</li>

      <li>i definitely made a good buy here..</li>
      <li>Great Cologne, wear it everyday.</li>
      <li>I PURCHASED THIS COLONE, WOMEN LOVE THE SMOOTH SMELL AND LAST THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND NOT OVERPOWERING!.</li>
      <li>Strong, masculine scent that lingers all day!</li>
      <li>and i like it Very much</li>
      <li>Great scent and long lasting.</li>
      <li>Better price than buying at the local mall or retail store.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very similar but a bit more</li>
      <li>I think this cologne may be more for a younger guy instead of a middle-aged person.</li>
      <li>Very nice and long lasting</li>
      <li>YOU WILL LOVE THIS AND IS A LITTLE BIT HIGHER IN $, BUT WORTH IT!</li>
      <li>my smell has progressed to wanting a professional clean smell, Idk what the heck</li>
      <li>This is going to be my new cologne for a while!!</li>

      <li>Not only did I get it cheaper than duty free by 10 dollars-</li>
      <li>A very nice scent but possibly a little overpowering initially.</li>
      <li>I have had Parada Luna Rosa, Lacoste Pure and some other famous men&#x27;s colognes</li>
      <li>i think it might even kick cool water out of the top spot for my everyday cologne!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll definitely buy more bottles in the future.</li>
      <li>Brand new in sealed wrapping.</li>
      <li>Also box and product were new and sealed as descibed by retailer.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s s very masculine smell</li>
      <li>When I was about 14 or 15 years old</li>
      <li>Too a chance on this one for my 16 year old.</li>
      <li>I could use this fragrance both as an everyday cologne and for special occasions.</li>
      <li>This is by far the longest lasting scent i had ever owned.</li>

    <li> Very nice, lots of good comments...</li>

Never buying this again!!!</li>
    <li> If you loved the original Cool Water, before they changed the formula, you&#x27;ll love this one. It&#x27;s very similar but a bit more spicy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, if you&#x27;re reading this Zino Davidoff, LEAVE THE FORMULA ALONE THIS TIME! Thank you!</li>
    <li> This cologne smells really really good. It&#x27;s s very masculine smell and it last all day !! This is going to be my new cologne for a while!!</li>
    <li> I like the perfume but it&#x27;s really too soft, and it vanishes quickly. Good for people that doesn&#x27;t like strong perfumes.</li>
    <li> Strong, masculine scent that lingers all day! I could use this fragrance both as an everyday cologne and for special occasions. Great winter scent. I&#x27;ll definitely buy more bottles in the future.</li>
    <li> i tried to buy the &amp;#34;Hot&amp;#34; version in stores, like Macy&#x27;s, but they only had the &amp;#34;Cold&amp;#34; version.  I have rec&#x27;d numerous compliments on this version.</li>
    <li> My hubby and I saw this on a cruise and really liked it.  He typically wears Cool Water but since our purchase, this is his new favorite.</li>
    <li> I find that a fragrance&#x27;s effectiveness is usually dependent on one&#x27;s body chemistry.  In that regard, this scent is mediocre for me.  In general, though, it is not a very intense scent and thus requires a lot of it to be applied if it&#x27;s going to be noticeable.</li>
    <li> What I like about this perfume is its fresh, spicy, and not too expensive. Its scent lasts for hours which is good if you decide to go out and have fun at night. Hint: many women like the smell.</li>
    <li> THIRD THIME I PURCHASED THIS COLONE, WOMEN LOVE THE SMOOTH SMELL AND LAST THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND NOT OVERPOWERING!. IF U LIKE COOL WATER YOU WILL LOVE THIS AND IS A LITTLE BIT HIGHER IN $, BUT WORTH IT!</li>
    <li> Not something I was actually expecting. The smell doesn&#x27;t stay for long and it is not the best of the best. I have had Parada Luna Rosa, Lacoste Pure and some other famous men&#x27;s colognes but this one did not impress me at all.</li>
    <li> All in a nut she&#x27;ll it smells great.,,</li>
    <li> Just perfect, package was well packed, it smells nice and the amount for the price is great.</li>
    <li> A very nice scent but possibly a little overpowering initially. I think this cologne may be more for a younger guy instead of a middle-aged person. My wife does like it.</li>

    <li> Great Deal fast shipping !!</li>
