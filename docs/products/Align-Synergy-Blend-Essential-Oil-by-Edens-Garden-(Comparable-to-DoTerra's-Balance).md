      <li>and it is such a great price, and I love love love it.</li>
      <li>All of Edens Garden essential oils are very good quality.</li>
      <li>Incredibly grounding essential oil blend !</li>
      <li>I like this just fine.  </li>
      <li>This is a great essential oil.  </li>
      <li>and I am NEVER disappointed.</li>
      <li>Any more I buy direct from Edens Garden to make sure they have not been diluted.</li>
      <li>And they arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>Edens Garden is also an amazing source for essential oils and all my transactions with them are fast &amp; smooth!</li>
      <li>I use this to calm me when I play the piano at church.</li>
      <li>Husband is loving it for his back too!</li>
      <li>Comparable to Young Living&#x27;s Valor, which is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve actually crafted my own blend of Align, Peppermint and carrier oil to use for massage</li>
      <li>It smells nice, but different, from Valor.</li>
      <li>I used this oil for the first time yesterday and literally couldn&#x27;t believe how calm and relaxed</li>
      <li>the smell is very much like valor.</li>
      <li>but I cannot figure out why you would pay twice as much or more for the same thing.  </li>
      <li>Will definitely be reordering this. :)</li>
      <li>and it smells exactly like valor</li>
      <li>I cannot describe the scent, but in a way we felt drawn to it, inhaling deeply and enjoying the way it made us feel.</li>
      <li>New to essential oils and loving all of them.</li>
      <li>I love this product and have used it extensively with certain clients.</li>
      <li>Works as good if not better than YL Or Do terra for me.</li>
      <li>my hubby&#x27;s) we felt ready to take on anything and relaxed.  </li>
      <li>The cost is extremely reasonable.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s been very affective.</li>
      <li>Very close to Valor&#x27;s quality</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>I really like it</li>
      <li>Works very well.</li>
      <li>Will be ordering from Edens Garden again in the near future. :)</li>
      <li>I have a huge collection of Edens garden oils and also have some Doterra, NAN, and young living - I must say that Edens garden is every bit as high quality as any of the other much more expensive brands - I have been happy with everything that I have purchased from them.  </li>
      <li>Will most definitely be purchasing again in the future!</li>
      <li>so that would mean that  this is even more like valor than valor is!</li>
      <li>I use it on a daily basis it really helps with adhd among so many other things...</li>
      <li>works just as well as the Young Living blend we were using to help with my husband&#x27;s congestion &amp; snoring - we are customers for life!</li>
      <li>the smell is a little bit strong</li>
      <li>really helps calm me down.  </li>
      <li>This oil is identical to valor from young living.</li>
      <li>Its by far one of my favorites</li>
      <li>Wow</li>
      <li>This is comparable to Young Living&#x27;s &amp;#34;Valor&amp;#34; blend.</li>
      <li>I am still fairly new to essential oils</li>
      <li>Valor is not available from YL right now and Balnce has a note in it</li>
      <li>this align - I use it on myself and husband every night - on the bottoms of the feet and down the spine - it really helps with hubbys snoring and helps realign the spine, and helps with posture</li>

    <li> amazing! Wow and it smells exactly like valor and it is such a great price, and I love love love it. I think valor is actually in a carrier oil, too (although I&amp;#34;m not positive) so that would mean that  this is even more like valor than valor is!</li>
    <li> I love this product and have used it extensively with certain clients. As soon as I got this I opened the bottle to take a sniff and felt an instant energy alignment! Nice :)</li>
    <li> I have a huge collection of Edens garden oils and also have some Doterra, NAN, and young living - I must say that Edens garden is every bit as high quality as any of the other much more expensive brands - I have been happy with everything that I have purchased from them.

    <li> Smells great!!  I am using it in homemade items like body butters, chopsticks, deodorants and shower fizzies!!!</li>
    <li> great oils for a great price.. I have replaced almost ALL of my more expensive oils to this brand and brag them up to all my clients!</li>
    <li> Great purchase experience</li>
    <li> I used this oil for the first time yesterday and literally couldn&#x27;t believe how calm and relaxed I felt a few minutes after putting it on. I will definitely be using this every evening to relax after a long day at the office!</li>
    <li> this smells very similar to Valor from YLEO and has the same ingredients. I really like it</li>
    <li> Edens Garden essential oils are superb and in my opinion the BEST essential oils of  all!  The cost is extremely reasonable.  Edens Garden surpasses quality, cost and packaging over ANY other essential oil company.  I have had oils from the younger and livelier companies and I always go back to EDENS GARDEN.</li>
    <li> Love Eden&#x27;s Garden products!</li>
    <li> I love the product but, was disappointed in the time it took for shipping. It took over one week and shipping wasn&#x27;t cheap!</li>
    <li> This is a great essential oil.  I combine a few drops of it with Black African Soap Shea Butter to use to treat psoriasis on my skin.  Works very well.</li>
    <li> It smells nice, but different, from Valor.</li>
    <li> Terrific product. Greatly reduces snoring! :)</li>
    <li> This product seems to do the trick.</li>
    <li> Very close to Valor&#x27;s quality</li>
    <li> love ths smell!  I use it in a diffuser. thanks</li>
    <li> I use this to calm me when I play the piano at church.</li>
    <li> This oil is identical to valor from young living. They have had that oil back ordered for so long and I needed to get my hands on some. This is seriously IDENTICAL to their blend valor and works just as well. Not to mention about a 1/3 of the price. I have bought Edens Gardens oils before and I am NEVER disappointed. Will most definitely be purchasing again in the future!</li>
    <li> New to essential oils and loving all of them.</li>
    <li> Put at base of spine, to align, I feel, so much better now, can&#x27;t believe how well it works!</li>
    <li> Valor is not available from YL right now and Balnce has a note in it I don&#x27;t care for.  Align is VERY POTENT, in my opinion.  It&#x27;s a good blend and helps me sleep.</li>
    <li> Love the smell ans is helping as a snore aide for my daughter</li>
    <li> I heard YL valor is great for focus so I wanted to get some for my son&#x27;s ADHD. They&#x27;ve been out of stock for a while so I have several oils from Edens garden and saw they had this one which is essentially the same thing.  I have had a crick in my neck alllll week, so painful and annoying. I put a drop of this in some coconut oil and rubbed on my neck and five minutes later, no crick and no pain! Dark blue color but it wasn&#x27;t noticeable after dilution and rubbing in.</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love this one!  The aroma is unique and just made me feel good, when applied to the bottoms of my feet (and my hubby&#x27;s) we felt ready to take on anything and relaxed.  I cannot describe the scent, but in a way we felt drawn to it, inhaling deeply and enjoying the way it made us feel.</li>
    <li> This is a great alternative to YL&#x27;s Valor. I am enjoying using it.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite EOs.  I keep it on my desk at work and a sniff when I&#x27;m feeling stressed really helps calm me down.  A much better value than the &amp;#34;big 2&amp;#34; EO companies out there!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the align, I use it every day to help with panic/anxiety and it is truly amazing. Edens Garden is also an amazing source for essential oils and all my transactions with them are fast &amp; smooth!</li>
    <li> Great product, I found it more desirable than the Doterra brand. Great quality, dreamy aroma just magical really.</li>
    <li> This is comparable to Young Living&#x27;s &amp;#34;Valor&amp;#34; blend. A little thin, but overall, really love the scent and my family all seems to benefit from using this on their backs to aid with alignment. I&#x27;ve actually crafted my own blend of Align, Peppermint and carrier oil to use for massage and it&#x27;s been very affective. Will definitely be reordering this. :)</li>
    <li> I LOVE this oil!!!...Its by far one of my favorites I use it on a daily basis it really helps with adhd among so many other things...</li>
    <li> LOVE this product!!  I use it for back pain... it smells wonderful and relaxes my spine....</li>
    <li> I have a kiddo that has the attention span of a goldfish.  I blend together a few blends and this is one of them and it helps her maintain her attention through school and at home.  She can get distracted by anything and the blend is a medication-free way of helping her keep her focus.  We love this blend!</li>
    <li> I love this oil! Just for the smell!! Husband is loving it for his back too!</li>
    <li> Great! Will purchase again.Nice quality.</li>
    <li> Incredibly grounding essential oil blend ! Everyone I have ever put this on LOVES it!</li>
    <li> Works as good if not better than YL Or Do terra for me.</li>
    <li> This is a really good combination, chiropractor in a bottle!</li>
    <li> Love this blend.  I had a sample of another, much more expensive, leading brand &amp; this one smells the same to me.  I am still fairly new to essential oils but I cannot figure out why you would pay twice as much or more for the same thing.  I&#x27;m sticking with Edens Garden brand.  I have found the oils to work great for me.</li>
    <li> I love the oils at a great price! I coyld be happier.....And they arrived quickly. Will be ordering from Edens Garden again in the near future. :)</li>
    <li> Quick turn around and excellent product!  Would definitely do business with this vendor again!</li>
    <li> works just as well as the Young Living blend we were using to help with my husband&#x27;s congestion &amp; snoring - we are customers for life!</li>
