      <li>The mirror is good quality, without much distortion in the magnified side.</li>
      <li>The tilt angles are fine for what I need.</li>
      <li>you are young with great eyesight and you have good lighting where you do your makeup, several of my &amp;#34;cons&amp;#34; may not apply to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Light switch.</li>
      <li>Light brightness.</li>
      <li>I originally saw this mirror at Ulta for $99.99.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m able to do better makeup application as I can actually see better.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s been a good addition to my make up table - to check make up in different lighting,</li>
      <li>/&gt;Things I dislike or am not crazy about:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>ok so far.</li>
      <li>The mirror and stand is made solid and I liked the lighting.</li>
      <li>This is worth it,</li>
      <li>just the right height.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I wonder why it is so hard for these companies to make a really great makeup mirror?</li>
      <li>I wonder why it is so hard for these companies to make a really great makeup mirror?</li>
      <li>Also, the LEDs don&#x27;t get hot, so there&#x27;s no chance I will burn</li>
      <li>The OFFICE setting is cool light and similar to florescent lighting.</li>
      <li>And that means you&#x27;ll have to bend over quite a bit to see your face, or else find a tall additional stand you could set this unit on so as to get it up higher for use.  </li>
      <li>I would love it if you would make a smaller version using LED lights and can be swiveled and tilted with one hand.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I won&#x27;t have to deal with replacing bulbs in the future.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m taking what she&#x27;s telling me about the product and am putting it in writing for those interested.</li>
      <li>I had two big box retailers trying to rip my wife off with high-pressure tactics and SALES - SALES - and then found this in less than 5 minutes for regular price $15 cheaper than anyone&#x27;s best SALE.&lt;br /&gt;Had</li>
      <li>This mirror is very dissappointing .</li>
      <li>My wife absolutely loves this mirror.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had everything from touch lights to a myriad of light switches, but this switch is different than anything I&#x27;ve had.</li>
      <li>biggest reason I chose this mirror over others is because the LEDs used to light it should last a lifetime.</li>
      <li>Both sides look the same with the light on either side of the mirror.</li>
      <li>Stay at home, take 5 minutes, click the mouse, get back to you family, and get a nice &#x27;surprise&#x27; the next day.</li>
      <li>Even on high, this mirror&#x27;s brightness is just enough for meto do detailed makeup work.</li>
      <li>There is a solid piece of glass that even covers the lights, so it&#x27;s easier to clean.</li>
      <li>The mirror can be rotated around completely to use the regular or magnified side, however this is more stiff than I&#x27;ve experienced with other mirrors.</li>
      <li>My only complaint is that the magnification is too great.</li>
      <li>Mainly used for tweezing eyebrow.</li>
      <li>The HOME setting is warm lighting and it&#x27;s not very bright.</li>
      <li>I like that it has a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; side and a highly magnified side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve put my mirror on a turn table, so I can spin it around to use the other side easily</li>
      <li>Light is not very bright, multi-colored lighting might be good for makeup, but not useful for a male.</li>
      <li>If I didn&#x27;t have the big light fixture I have in my bathroom, I doubt I could see enough to use this mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really like this mirror, but have seen in the reviews that it doesnt tilt far back enough and thats true.</li>
      <li>I have had makeup mirrors with varying light levels in the past and, while I used one setting most of the time, the others were at least somewhat useful for evening makeup, etc.</li>
      <li>As far as reflection surfaces, the mirror is obviously a 1X mag, the opposite side magnifyer is 10X.  Very powerful.</li>
      <li>If the problem turns out to be the &#x27;lifetime LED lights&#x27; then the problem cannot be fixed - the rep said Conair does not have spare parts, hence why, they do not do repairs</li>
      <li>Just personally I think 10X may be too much magnification</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had numerous mirrors over the years that swiveled to switch from magnifying side to normal side, but I have never seen anything like the swivel mechanism on this mirror.</li>
      <li>In general, she likes it.&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
      <li>Returned item because the light was not bright enough for her.</li>
      <li>Too tall, not bright enough light, I returned it.</li>
      <li>The rotation up or down is very limited, so getting the right angle can be difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>this mirror does not tilt forward and back so it is virtually impossible to get a good angle for viewing your face.</li>
      <li>Since I use the highest setting all of the time, I can see this light switch dying before its time because I have to go past the other settings to get to high.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>

    <li> Kind of distorted and weird, arguably even too small.  Not as tall as expected.  Returned it.</li>
    <li> Too tall, not bright enough light, I returned it.</li>
    <li> This mirror is very dissappointing . It has a very limited tilt range so you have to bring your head down to see yourself . Over priced for what it is .</li>
    <li> I must admit that I was a little disappointed when I first received this mirror, but chose to keep it and have been using it for quite some time now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Oval shape. I much prefer the oval shape of this mirror to the smaller round mirrors. It better reflects face shape.&lt;br /&gt;2. 10X magnification. I am 62 and wouldn&#x27;t be able to put my makeup on accurately without this level of magnification.&lt;br /&gt;3. Two sides/two magnifications. I like that it has a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; side and a highly magnified side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I dislike or am not crazy about:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Swivel/tilt. I&#x27;ve had numerous mirrors over the years that swiveled to switch from magnifying side to normal side, but I have never seen anything like the swivel mechanism on this mirror. It&#x27;s obnoxious, and I don&#x27;t see a reason/purpose for it to be the way it is.&lt;br /&gt;2. Lighting levels. I have had makeup mirrors with varying light levels in the past and, while I used one setting most of the time, the others were at least somewhat useful for evening makeup, etc. Again, this is probably an age thing, but I can&#x27;t see well enough to even use the other levels on this mirror so I always keep it on the highest/brightest setting.&lt;br /&gt;3. Light switch. I&#x27;ve had everything from touch lights to a myriad of light switches, but this switch is different than anything I&#x27;ve had. Since I use the highest setting all of the time, I can see this light switch dying before its time because I have to go past the other settings to get to high.&lt;br /&gt;4. Light brightness. Even on high, this mirror&#x27;s brightness is just enough for meto do detailed makeup work. If I didn&#x27;t have the big light fixture I have in my bathroom, I doubt I could see enough to use this mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are young with great eyesight and you have good lighting where you do your makeup, several of my &amp;#34;cons&amp;#34; may not apply to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have owned countless makeup mirrors over the years. Some of them were okay but none of them were GREAT. I wonder why it is so hard for these companies to make a really great makeup mirror? It&#x27;s frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 stars &#x3D; &amp;#34;just okay&amp;#34;okay but none of them were GREAT.

    <li> My wife absolutely loves this mirror.  She has had them in the past but none with the quality of this.  Very well built and the lighting is excellent!</li>
    <li> My only complaint is that the magnification is too great. Otherwise, the finish (bushed nickel) and shape are nice, good lighting options/adjustments, mirror tilt/swivel work ok so far.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror because I have poor vision. I cannot wear contacts or get laser eye surgery, so I wear glasses and have to put on makeup without them. This mirror has helped me see so much better and improve my makeup application. It has one side with no magnification and the other side has 10X magnification. Both sides look the same with the light on either side of the mirror. There is a solid piece of glass that even covers the lights, so it&#x27;s easier to clean. There is a switch with 4 settings: OFF, OFFICE, HOME, and DAY. The OFFICE setting is cool light and similar to florescent lighting. The HOME setting is warm lighting and it&#x27;s not very bright. The DAY setting is similar to sunlight and is the brightest setting. This is the one I usually use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The construction seems pretty sturdy and good quality. The mirror is good quality, without much distortion in the magnified side. The mirror can be rotated around completely to use the regular or magnified side, however this is more stiff than I&#x27;ve experienced with other mirrors. The rotation up or down is very limited, so getting the right angle can be difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve put my mirror on a turn table, so I can spin it around to use the other side easily and I was able to get just the right height.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest reason I chose this mirror over others is because the LEDs used to light it should last a lifetime. I&#x27;m glad I won&#x27;t have to deal with replacing bulbs in the future. Also, the LEDs don&#x27;t get hot, so there&#x27;s no chance I will burn myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this mirror. I see so much better to apply my makeup and I expect this mirror to last a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this mirror for 1 year and a month and it&#x27;s been a good addition to my make up table - to check make up in different lighting, and of course, the 10X magnification is perfect for examining blemishes or detailed eye make up work. The tilt angle could be further but not a huge problem for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the mirror&#x27;s lights or switch have recently broken. The lights do not turn on any setting. And because the warranty (1year) had passed (by less than a month) and Conair does not repair, I&#x27;m now left with a mirror with no lights. I&#x27;ve called Conair Customer Service about self paid repairs and they do not offer it. Instead, the rep recommended I take it to an external small home appliance shop to get it fixed. If the problem turns out to be the &#x27;lifetime LED lights&#x27; then the problem cannot be fixed - the rep said Conair does not have spare parts, hence why, they do not do repairs (replacements only within warranty).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is fine but based on the lack of repair / replacement options for a relatively expensive item, I would hesitate to recommend this to others. Should the lights or switch break on you after just a year, you&#x27;ll be left with an expensive magnifying mirror.</li>
    <li> My wife bought and has been using this lighted magnifyer/mirror (also known as a lighted makeup mirror),...I&#x27;m taking what she&#x27;s telling me about the product and am putting it in writing for those interested. In general, she likes it.&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s some facts about the product: 1. There&#x27;s a three position sliding light switch, mounted on the side of the base, to set the LED&#x27;s  to either OFFICE, HOME,  or DAY color temperature.  As far as reflection surfaces, the mirror is obviously a 1X mag, the opposite side magnifyer is 10X.  Very powerful. The unit looks great.  There is a bit of a &#x27;down side&#x27; per my wife, and I can see her point..... the stem of the unit mounts into the mirror/mag fram with a ball mount for changing the angle of the mirror or magnifyer as you look at it.  This mount only lets you tip the mirror or magnifyer (depending on which side you are using) just a small amount.  And that means you&#x27;ll have to bend over quite a bit to see your face, or else find a tall additional stand you could set this unit on so as to get it up higher for use.  I know you see the upper frame as round in its general shape , but the actual reflecting surfaces (mirror on one side, magnifyer on the other) are eliptical (approx. 6 1/4\\&quot; wide, and 7 3/4\\&quot; tall. You&#x27;ll see that when you look at the image closely.  It&#x27;s those spaces on the perimeter that are the lighted surfaces when you turn on the switch.&lt;br /&gt;If you have any specific detail questions, I&#x27;ll try to answer them.&lt;br /&gt;Don P.</li>
    <li> this mirror does not tilt forward and back so it is virtually impossible to get a good angle for viewing your face. we returned it immediately.</li>
    <li> The mirror and stand is made solid and I liked the lighting. But the magnification is of inferior design and one has to place nose two inches from mirror which then strains the eyes terribly so and disallows focusing with both eyes and I have good vision. I am returning it.</li>
    <li> I returned this item.  It was too difficult to swivel and tilt. I would love it if you would make a smaller version using LED lights and can be swiveled and tilted with one hand.</li>
    <li> I really like this mirror, but have seen in the reviews that it doesnt tilt far back enough and thats true. Would give five stars if that wasnt the case. Although great seller, thanks!!!</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my wife. Liked that it had LED light and that it would have bright lights. Returned item because the light was not bright enough for her.</li>
    <li> This mirror has it all...adjustable lighting for day, home and office. I use the day setting all of the time, it&#x27;s nice and bright. The 10x magnifier is great for plucking eyebrows. The tilt angles are fine for what I need. It&#x27;s also got good weight to it, so no worry about bumping it and tipping it over. I originally saw this mirror at Ulta for $99.99. Great price on Amazon. I read every review on all types of lighted mirrors. This is worth it, no complaints and I&#x27;m able to do better makeup application as I can actually see better.</li>
    <li> The best mirror I have ever owned. Mainly used for tweezing eyebrow.</li>
    <li> This mirror has been a life saver! I really love the way it is, I like the lighting and the way it is.&lt;br /&gt;It works perfect for me. Doesn&#x27;t take any space, and it works as expected.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy to have it!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect. The neat thing about this was the price. I had two big box retailers trying to rip my wife off with high-pressure tactics and SALES - SALES - and then found this in less than 5 minutes for regular price $15 cheaper than anyone&#x27;s best SALE.&lt;br /&gt;Had it hear within 36 hours for free - best we&#x27;ve ever had. THIS is why you buy from Amazon, and THIS is why you also get the prime. The money, time, energy, gas, and hassle and being lied too alone finds us increasingly not wanting to even go out and blow our entire afternoon with the sheep, with disinterested sales people who act like they are the ones doing us a favor. Stay at home, take 5 minutes, click the mouse, get back to you family, and get a nice &#x27;surprise&#x27; the next day. C&#x27;mon - only way to go - 21st Century - our kids will be laughing at us when they found out the way we USED to shop. Oh, in my state NO TAX is another incredible bonus!</li>
    <li> It works. Just personally I think 10X may be too much magnification</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter and she loves it. Has 3 different light settings and looks very nice as well!</li>
    <li> This mirror is of good quality however it lacks in some areas.  It has a solid construction, however has limited tilt range.  Light is not very bright, multi-colored lighting might be good for makeup, but not useful for a male.</li>
    <li> Been looking for a LED with 10X magnifier side, and they are expensive!  Found this great bargain because of a damaged box, but the mirror was in excellent condition.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift...recipient loves it.</li>
