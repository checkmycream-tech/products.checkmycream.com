    <li> I bought this set for my 11 year old daughter&#x27;s birthday and it exceeded my expectations. She did not like the brown colors very much, but the makeup is good quality and stays on really well and for the entire day. The nail polish is quality as well and stays on without chipping. The box arrived in great condition with none of the makeup crushed, or broken. I would recommend the Carry All Train Case Makeup Set and would purchase again.</li>
    <li> My Grandaughter Loves this! The blush did come apart but she uses this as play makeup. It is hard to get off. Just soap and water......</li>
