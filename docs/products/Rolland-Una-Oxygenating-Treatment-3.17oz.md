    <li> My hair was falling out in clumps.  After using this product for 5 months now, my hair is growing back strong and fuller.  I did notice my hair a bit dry but I started using the UNA Intensive Protein Treatment 500ml By Roland and it&#x27;s done wonders to give my hair a nice shine and manageability.</li>
    <li> Excelente Seller! Product as described and fast shipment.</li>
    <li> Seems to work well. Using second bottle. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I used the product 3 times a week and I notice a different.  my hair started to grow in spots were is wasn&#x27;t growing</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife and she loves it.</li>
    <li> this treatment is amazing! It really helps your hair grow and get full.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know how well this product works, I have only been using it for about a month. I put it on a q-tip and apply it to my eyebrows because they are so thin and it seems to be making them grow in a little. Love the smell and the tingling sensation after using.</li>
    <li> Its a very great product, and it has been really making my hair grow. My hair was thinning out on the sides, but once I started using the product its now growing back.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference. Maybe I needed to use it everyday.</li>
    <li> I just got product. It burn when I first put it on but then it was soothing. Seems good for stimulating growth. The menthol smell a little strong when first applied but this fades away once hair is dry. I will update in a month in regards to how well it works</li>
    <li> My family and I love the UNA products</li>
    <li> grate for people with fungus or folicle infections even scalp acne but not so grate to stop hair loss or even regrow hair if your loss is in some level genetic.</li>
    <li> I love this product. My hair was thinning due to Celiac disease and this product has really helped it come back in. Very fast shipping and great seller.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff it madr my hair grow back in the crown of my head. I thought I was going to be bald there forever but applying this to the area every day made my hair grown back.  So thankful for this product.</li>
    <li> Great Product would recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> Absolutely love ita! my hair grew 1&amp;#34; in a month that is fantastic my hair never grow. very happy with this product.Rosa. Fort lauderdale.Fl</li>
    <li> Really helps to stop hair loss.  Feels really good - cool and soothing.  Less hairs fall out.  Really like it.</li>
    <li> It does not provide a result as claimed after I have used this product for 10 months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months and I&#x27;m very pleased with it. I&#x27;m an African-American woman and has had some issues with my hair. This product has helped with new growth for the past few months and I&#x27;ll keep ordering it. If you are getting a relaxer, you might not want to use it on that day, but you can use it a couple of days afterwards. You may feel stinging or tingling while under a hair dryer so, if you&#x27;re scalp is a little tender, wait a couple of days til your scalp has healed. I recommended this product to my girlfriend who is hispanic (straight hair &amp; no chemicals) and she agrees that it&#x27;s works. I use it over my whole head and am happy with the results!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 2 years and since I have highlights and dye my hair frequently, it tends to fall. This product has helped me to have &amp;#34;only the hair that was going to fall anyway&amp;#34; fall....amazing product!</li>
    <li> I choose the rating because it is doing what it said it would do.  I found this product in Connecticut, but couldn&#x27;t find it here until I looked up the e-mail address on the box, and the rest is history</li>
    <li> I purchase this product from the Dominician hair salon.  My hair is short and course.  I have been trying to grow my hair out for a while, my hair start to break off because my thyroid.  She told me to try it I did it stop the breakage.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it it leave your hair dry so put a good moisture cream on your hair.  The drop is good because it allows you to but it directly on your scalp.  It been about a month and my hair has grown about 1/2 inch with little shedding.</li>
    <li> This product did help with the shedding, but that&#x27;s about it. I lam African American and like to keep my hair flat-ironed, so this product being a liquid rather than oil worked against my hairstyle.</li>
    <li> I was told by my dermatologist that i got scar tissue right in the mid scalp she said that was &amp;#34;too late&amp;#34; i would never grow back hair she called it &amp;#34; Centrifugal Alopecia&amp;#34; caused by braiding, weaving, and bonding. Guess what? Una Oxygenated gives me my hair back. The doctor didn&#x27;t recognize me.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0055DUBMY Rolland Una Oxygenating Treatment 3.17oz]]I &#x27;ve always used this product from UNA and it works really well, I was a little skeptical about the authenticity of the product purchasing through ebay, but it seems to be the real thing. I will definitely repurchase.  It helps the loss of hair and assists in regrowth.</li>
    <li> Excellent hair loss tonic! it helped me so much: i lost half of my hair last october(after a big stress) and this tonic helps a lot regrowing it. it, as well,helped a lot with the eczema on my scalp. i definitely recommand this product. i ordered this tonic many time and will again!</li>
    <li> it works and I love it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any changes in the growth of my hair, however, it stopped the breakage.  I have actually used 4 bottles. BUT, I haven&#x27;t given up.  I will try a couple more to see if I get results in hair growth.</li>
