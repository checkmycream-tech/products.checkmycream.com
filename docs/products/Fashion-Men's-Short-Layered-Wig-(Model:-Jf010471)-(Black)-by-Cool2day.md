      <li>Quick, courteous service.</li>
      <li>so realistic its almost too good to be true :)&lt;</li>
      <li>Very happy with product, butI suggest if ordering for something time-sensitive, like Halloween, you order at least 6 weeks in advance.</li>
      <li>Seriously one of the best wigs I&#x27;ve gotten here.</li>
      <li>Overall the wig itself is nice.</li>
      <li>Very realistic, look like real hair, good quality, can be wear like a wig for daily usage, I recommended it.</li>

      <li>Very realistic for the price.  </li>
      <li>It really wasn&#x27;t what I wanted, but it will do.</li>

      <li>I had when I was 22 Years old.</li>
      <li>What&#x27;s more it&#x27;s rather delicate...</li>
      <li>My 14 year old daughter paid for this item herself and had it in time for her convention.</li>
      <li>I encourage anyone who wants to look like a Middle Eastern/Asian Justin Bieber to get this!</li>
      <li>Maybe old glue?</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been able to style it in order to look like Tony Stark, Toph from The Last Avenger and Michael Jackson.  </li>
      <li>I ordered was less straight than the first.</li>
      <li>It is really thin, you are able to see tracks.</li>
      <li>It does look kinda real but almost at the same time you might be able to tell if it&#x27;s fake.</li>
      <li>First of all, if you&#x27;re expecting the results to be like that of the model&#x27;s in the picture, you&#x27;re dead mistaken</li>

<li> It IS a short haired wig and unfortunately, if you have a big head, it&#x27;s not going to cover all of it.</li>
<li> so don&#x27;t style it or pull on it too hard</li>
<li> What I mean by that is that the hair do</li>
<li> that is not good service.</li>
<li> Not happy have to cut to make work.</li>
<li> Bottom Line is it&#x27;s not so bad for the price you pay for it.</li>

    <li> The second Fashion Men&#x27;s Short Layered Wig (Model: Jf010471) (Black) I ordered was less straight than the first.</li>
    <li> I got this for a cosplay I wanted to do. I thought that it&#x27;d be cheaper to get a wig that wasn&#x27;t specifically made for the character I wanted to portray. It was cheaper, but so not worth it. Now I&#x27;m going to have to get the other wig in addition to this one. It looks nothing like the picture, and while it does look realistic enough, it&#x27;s very poorly made. I&#x27;m constantly having giant chunks falling out of mine. I don&#x27;t recommend the effort if you want a good-quality wig that doesn&#x27;t fall apart on you.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT IT AS A GAG GIFT</li>
    <li> This wig was amazing.The Fibers looked so real. It was like the head of hair I had when I was 22 Years old. AMAZING !!!!!</li>
    <li> The hairs keep falling out. Maybe old glue?</li>
    <li> For such a cheap price, I figured it would be worn once, for Halloween, and then thrown out, but its actually of decent quality. My son needed it to dress as Dr. Benjamin Franklin Pierce, aka &amp;#34;Hawkeye&amp;#34; from M.A.S.H. the tv show. He can use it for many Halloweens to come! Very happy with product, butI suggest if ordering for something time-sensitive, like Halloween, you order at least 6 weeks in advance. The seller emailed me that it was shipped from HongKong on Sep.29th, but (I guess thanks to US Customs) we didn&#x27;t get it till Nov5th.</li>
    <li> typical cheap Halloween style wig. it is exactly how you see it, you cannot style it. the under netting and &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; were decent quality</li>
    <li> Many thanks for your excellent quick service and cooperation the wig Ultimate  and Recommend...........&lt;br /&gt;Shape change for the better ilove it</li>
    <li> Perfect for the occasion.</li>
    <li> Did not received this wig! I got a much longer womans style bob wig, not at all like what is pictured. Not happy have to cut to make work.</li>
    <li> Excellent!! Really came in handy on my first date with my future wife! I love you, Roger!!</li>
    <li> First of all, if you&#x27;re expecting the results to be like that of the model&#x27;s in the picture, you&#x27;re dead mistaken and you&#x27;ll regret it. It IS a short haired wig and unfortunately, if you have a big head, it&#x27;s not going to cover all of it. What&#x27;s more it&#x27;s rather delicate... so don&#x27;t style it or pull on it too hard: it&#x27;s going to shed all over the place. If you just want a mat of string over your head get it. Otherwise, go out and find a more quality wig.</li>
    <li> Very realistic, look like real hair, good quality, can be wear like a wig for daily usage, I recommended it.</li>
    <li> Waited an entire month before it finally arrived. It does look kinda real but almost at the same time you might be able to tell if it&#x27;s fake. Either way I like it, I just have to play with it a little to break it in the way you would with a new pair of sneakers. Then I can accessorize it with a hat and whatnot. Bottom Line is it&#x27;s not so bad for the price you pay for it.</li>
    <li> It really wasn&#x27;t what I wanted, but it will do.</li>
    <li> I look 20 years younger! :)</li>
    <li> The product wasnt the same as it is shown in the picture here. Its totally different, but I think its gng to work</li>
    <li> The wig itself looks nice on. It is really thin, you are able to see tracks. I may have to add in some hair extensions to make it thicker. Overall the wig itself is nice.</li>
    <li> Very realistic for the price.  I look awesome in it.  So happy with the purchase.  I encourage anyone who wants to look like a Middle Eastern/Asian Justin Bieber to get this!</li>
    <li> I Love the Wig!! but what I don&#x27;t like when I purchase the wig, and now it&#x27;s a different price. that is not good service. other than that! Very HAPPY!</li>
    <li> Seriously one of the best wigs I&#x27;ve gotten here. It feels so natural and the hair is beautiful. I&#x27;ve been able to style it in order to look like Tony Stark, Toph from The Last Avenger and Michael Jackson.  What I mean by that is that the hair do is really nice to style and the hair is of great great quality.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve worn it to go out and nobody notices it&#x27;s fake :3</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Very nice. Exactly as expected. Great seller!</li>
    <li> Hilarious wig my son bought so he could go incognito in the neighborhood.  He&#x27;s nine and it&#x27;s a hoot.  I bet it would make a perfectly nice wig for a serious wearer as well.  Well made.</li>
    <li> Great seller! Quick, courteous service. I was very pleased with merchandise and the service. My 14 year old daughter paid for this item herself and had it in time for her convention. Wonderful product and company. She will recommend this seller to all her cosplay friends.</li>
    <li> Beautiful so life like, friends and family didn&#x27;t know the difference...</li>
    <li> Wonderful absolutely wonderful&lt;br /&gt;its so realistic its almost too good to be true :)&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product thank you i am very very happy</li>
