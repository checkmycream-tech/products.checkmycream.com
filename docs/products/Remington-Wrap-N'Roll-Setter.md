      <li>Price is good.</li>
      <li>Good service.  </li>
      <li>of the best things about this is that you can put the rollers in and get ready for the day while it sets.</li>

      <li>Best of all, I frequently get compliments on my hair when I&#x27;ve used the rollers.</li>
      <li>The first set worked so great</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve purchased three and glad</li>
      <li>I sure going to order more because I don&#x27;t ever want to be without this product.</li>
      <li>and I love them.</li>
      <li>which has 24 spoolies in each one them, and then I bought 2 more.</li>
      <li>I love that the rubber flip over \\&quot;clip\\&quot; is attatched.</li>
      <li>They make lovely curls.</li>
      <li>I am at this site to purchase 2 more of these curler set ups.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;You can burn your fingers, but as you get the use of anything you get better at it.</li>
      <li>and when it was longer the curls stayed for the whole day!!!!</li>
      <li>I was able to get them for a pretty good price of about 15 dollars a piece (including shipping)&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
      <li>They work great on my fine hair and are ready to put in and take off in no time.  </li>
      <li>I end up with a full look and tons of curls in about 5 minutes!</li>
      <li>Also they are lightweight and easy to travel with.</li>
      <li>I received this item very quickly.  </li>
      <li>The Remington set is so easy to use and produce ringlets.</li>
      <li>When I first tried this product I couldn&#x27;t get my hair wrapped nicely around the roller, some of the hairs were falling apart.  </li>
      <li>They hold the hair nicely and curl well, they just don&#x27;t hold as much.</li>
      <li>I purchased this set as a gift to myself and am not disappointed.</li>
      <li>I have conair hot sticks, and I love them.</li>
      <li>I bought this on a whim, I wanted some more hot rollers.</li>
      <li>ok with me because I like them so much.  </li>
      <li>The seller has the rollers, but refuses to refund me in full because I used them one time.</li>
      <li>Why did I not recieve my full refund?</li>
      <li>Fast heat up,curls your hair and easy to use.  </li>
      <li>No matter though, they are relatively inexpensive and I love that they are so easy to take with me when traveling too,</li>
      <li>We used to roll her hair in little sponge rollers the night before, but these rollers are great.</li>
      <li>so all in all they are worth it.</li>
      <li>My hair is naturally very straight and chemically treated.  </li>
      <li>If you like hot rollers this is something to try because it does not have clips they lock on themselves.</li>
      <li>They also can be hot on your fingers.</li>
      <li>The self-locking style is a bit tricky at first, but you just basically roll the hair and then turn the doo-hickey inside out.</li>
      <li>I simply can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
      <li>My daughter has very straight hair and it curled her hair very well.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>This also holds up very well to use, I use mine all the time</li>
      <li>and they really one give a wave to hair.</li>
      <li>Sometimes a person wants varity, so I decided to try these.</li>
      <li>The rollers heated up fast as well.  </li>
      <li>so I have to purchase a whole kit.  </li>
      <li>That seller gave me a full refund and also paid for the shipping back to them - Now that seller knows what \\&quot;Customer Service\\&quot; really means.</li>
      <li>I returned the set for full refund as you said but only recieved $5.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many different curling irons and spent hundreds of dollars trying different things and nothing worked (my hair is super straight.)</li>
      <li>Normally we don&#x27;t roll it, but she is in a cheer group that wears their hair curly.</li>
      <li>There are so many little rollers!</li>
      <li>I do not like regular hot rollers because of the pins and clamps</li>
      <li>I need to dress formally frequently for Eastern Star and want to look professional at work.</li>
      <li>Expect to have more curlers in your hair than with other setups because these tend to be thinner than other setups.  </li>
      <li>I love them, they give me tight long lasting curls all day.</li>
      <li>It makes curing my hair so much easier then using an iron or the other rollers where the clips come off completely.</li>
      <li>When you finally get your hair in the rollers, it doesn&#x27;t really take the long to get the hair curled.</li>
      <li>I am african american with natural 3c hair</li>
      <li>This product not only works, but it heats up quickly, and only takes a few minutes to put in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Sooo...I&#x27;ll likely be purchasing a second set in the near future.</li>

<li> If you have thick hair you probably won&#x27;t be able to do your entire head unless you buy two sets because each curler only holds a small amount of hair.   </li>

<li> and they don&#x27;t last long.  </li>
<li> The only hang up is with the shortest sections of my hair, that are probably 1 1/2 inches long.</li>
<li> I thought maybe she was not leaving them on long enough</li>
<li> /&gt;This is also a versitile product- if you twist your hair before you put the curlers in you get corkscrew curls; if you put a lot of hair in a roller you get soft waves, if you leave them in for a long time they will be tight curls, an if you leave the in for a shorter time they will be softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>

<li> I have given up hair cuts due to a tight budget and was frustrated with my fine, straight hair.</li>
<li> The only down side to this set made by Remington is that they are a little &#x27;thinner&#x27; than those I had back in the day...frequent use and they tend to rip or break to a point that they are unusable.</li>
<li> : blowdry, then roll these in my hair...apply makeup...take rollers out, fluff and out the door w/minimal effort.</li>

    <li> I have thin, blond hair that holds curl ok, but not great. These curlers gave me luscious, thick spirals in no time. Heating up takes a little while, but not as long as I expected. I don&#x27;t even need to use product to get great spiral curls. The only hang up is with the shortest sections of my hair, that are probably 1 1/2 inches long. It&#x27;s a little hard to manipulate the roller around the hair because of the shape of the curler. However, it&#x27;s doable and still works. Five stars! This beats the pants off any curling iron I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Buyers Beware... I purchaed these rollers and used them one time. The rollers made my hair a bit frizzy so I decided to return them back to the seller. The seller has the rollers, but refuses to refund me in full because I used them one time. I will never purchase any items from this seller. I tried a different set of rolers from another seller and returned those as well. That seller gave me a full refund and also paid for the shipping back to them - Now that seller knows what \\&quot;Customer Service\\&quot; really means.</li>
    <li> I have given up hair cuts due to a tight budget and was frustrated with my fine, straight hair. I need to dress formally frequently for Eastern Star and want to look professional at work. I purchased this set as a gift to myself and am not disappointed. There are so many little rollers! The self-locking style is a bit tricky at first, but you just basically roll the hair and then turn the doo-hickey inside out. I heat them up while I&#x27;m blow drying my hair, a moment to roll, and let them set while I put on my make up. I end up with a full look and tons of curls in about 5 minutes! Thank you, Remington, for giving me style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000Q6RHQ8 Remington Wrap N&#x27;Roll Setter]]</li>
    <li> I had the impression that the roller size was bigger on these. It&#x27;s the attached fasteners that make it look that way in the pictures. I found using them awkward as well, don&#x27;t care for the way they dangle either.</li>
    <li> The delivery was quick, which was great.  The rollers heated up fast as well.  When I first tried this product I couldn&#x27;t get my hair wrapped nicely around the roller, some of the hairs were falling apart.  Twisting the strands before rolling (included in their instructions) helped.  When you finally get your hair in the rollers, it doesn&#x27;t really take the long to get the hair curled.</li>
    <li> They work beautifully!!! Fast heat up,curls your hair and easy to use.  They make lovely curls. I&#x27;ve purchased three and glad I did just in case they stop making them...Also they are lightweight and easy to travel with.</li>
    <li> The curler set was the wrong size. I called and you said you would e mail a return sticker and you did. I returned the set for full refund as you said but only recieved $5. and some cents on my AE. I am talking to AE now but would like an answer from you. Why did I not recieve my full refund?</li>
    <li> I purchased these because they looked just like a set I had in HS manufactured by Conair. Well, they did the trick and were just like those I used back in the day. The Remington set is so easy to use and produce ringlets. Morning routine: blowdry, then roll these in my hair...apply makeup...take rollers out, fluff and out the door w/minimal effort. Best of all, I frequently get compliments on my hair when I&#x27;ve used the rollers. The only down side to this set made by Remington is that they are a little &#x27;thinner&#x27; than those I had back in the day...frequent use and they tend to rip or break to a point that they are unusable. Sooo...I&#x27;ll likely be purchasing a second set in the near future. No matter though, they are relatively inexpensive and I love that they are so easy to take with me when traveling too, so all in all they are worth it.</li>
    <li> I bought this on a whim, I wanted some more hot rollers. I have conair hot sticks, and I love them. Sometimes a person wants varity, so I decided to try these. I do not know if these are discontinued because they are extremely hard to find unless you buy them online, which of course includes the dreaded shipping fee. I love them, they give me tight long lasting curls all day. I was able to get them for a pretty good price of about 15 dollars a piece (including shipping)&lt;br /&gt;and I bought 2 which has 24 spoolies in each one them, and then I bought 2 more. I am one of those people who does not like to run out or have to few of something. If you like hot rollers this is something to try because it does not have clips they lock on themselves. I do not like regular hot rollers because of the pins and clamps and they really one give a wave to hair. I like curls and these do just that. I am a very happy customer. I am african american with natural 3c hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can burn your fingers, but as you get the use of anything you get better at it. I sometimes burn my fingers on my hotsticks ( which I have had for at least 4 years). If you do burn it will not be enough to leave a mark or for it to hurt later.</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally very straight and chemically treated.  These rollers put a bouncy, shiny curl in my hair and without any wire pins to keep up with! Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Mydaughter has lots of long thick hair. Normally we don&#x27;t roll it, but she is in a cheer group that wears their hair curly. We used to roll her hair in little sponge rollers the night before, but these rollers are great. No more sleeping on rollers. I love that the rubber flip over \\&quot;clip\\&quot; is attatched. Easier for me!</li>
    <li> I like how my hair looks after using these curlers. If you have thick hair you probably won&#x27;t be able to do your entire head unless you buy two sets because each curler only holds a small amount of hair.   They also can be hot on your fingers. Price is good.</li>
    <li> My wife used these as a kid and loved them.  Found them and got two sets.  They curl well, but don&#x27;t have the biggest rollers in the world.  Expect to have more curlers in your hair than with other setups because these tend to be thinner than other setups.  They hold the hair nicely and curl well, they just don&#x27;t hold as much.</li>
    <li> I am at this site to purchase 2 more of these curler set ups.  They work great on my fine hair and are ready to put in and take off in no time.  Excellent for travel.  The only draw back is that the curler and the attached flip back clip are entirely make of silicone and they don&#x27;t last long.  I looked to buy just curler replacements but they don&#x27;t sell them so I have to purchase a whole kit.  But that&#x27;t ok with me because I like them so much.  I will have invested $40 bucks for the 2 and will have lots of curlers as back ups for awhile but I am still going to pursue finding just curlers also.  Lyne   May &#x27;08</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for 4 years and I love them. It makes curing my hair so much easier then using an iron or the other rollers where the clips come off completely.</li>
    <li> This is the second set of curlers I have bought that were the wrap and roll.  The first set worked so great I decided to get a set for my friend, unfortunately hers BARELY heat up and leave minimal curl.  I thought maybe she was not leaving them on long enough so I went over to her house a week or 2 ago and plugged in her set and rolled up just one curler in my hair and left if for 30+ minutes, I had a ONLY a MINOR wave, nothing like the curl I recieve from my rollers.  So I guess with a set like these it&#x27;s 50/50 for heat and preformance</li>
    <li> I have long and thick hair that is niether straight nor curly, and I spent years trying to find something that would curl my hair. This product not only works, but it heats up quickly, and only takes a few minutes to put in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also a versitile product- if you twist your hair before you put the curlers in you get corkscrew curls; if you put a lot of hair in a roller you get soft waves, if you leave them in for a long time they will be tight curls, an if you leave the in for a shorter time they will be softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the best things about this is that you can put the rollers in and get ready for the day while it sets. This also holds up very well to use, I use mine all the time and I finally need to replace it after a few years. I simply can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
    <li> I just got a hair cut and will probably not use these rollers right now, but I have very thick hair and when it was longer the curls stayed for the whole day!!!! Good product and very good transaction with the seller!!!!!</li>
    <li> I received this item very quickly.  My daughter has very straight hair and it curled her hair very well.  I did leave the rollers in longer than the time recommended on the instructions to ensure that the curls were set.  Would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a product to straighten my hair. This is to make tiny curls.</li>
    <li> BEST THING EVER! I have tried so many different curling irons and spent hundreds of dollars trying different things and nothing worked (my hair is super straight.) until I came across the Remington Wrap N&#x27;Roll Setters. I sure going to order more because I don&#x27;t ever want to be without this product.</li>
    <li> I got this as a Christmas gift for  my daughter in law.    She had asked for them as a gift.  Good service.  Thank you.</li>
