      <li>By the time we were done consummating our renewed thrill of teenage college exceptionally pink-button sex, the coeds were singing along with us to all the greatest hits of the Lilith Fair Tour.  </li>
      <li>I stumbled upon this product by happenstance, but I can honestly say it has changed my life for the better.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s faded over time, as most things tend to do.  </li>
      <li>, I worry about many things more.</li>
      <li>Now people pay top dollar for my ladies, and this product is the reason why.</li>
      <li>Most memorable night ever.  </li>
      <li>PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE make sure you read the instructions before applying...</li>
      <li>My boyfriend has a bit of an Avatar fetish, and enjoys making love during cosplay.</li>
      <li>I think I would get a better and longer-lasting result if it came with a vibrating applicator.</li>
      <li>Would love to know if this can be used to recreate the youthful glow I once had.</li>
      <li>I used to glitter up my area to make my gynecologist&#x27;s work more enjoyable (face it, looking at hoohaws all day could be monotonous)  </li>
      <li>Oh I just cannot say enough wonderful things about this product!!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m looking more for something more along the lines of \\&quot;Enraged Baboon\\&quot; or \\&quot;Fleet</li>
      <li>A cream to make my vajayjay more &amp;#34;pink?&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Perhaps the Helen (Mirren) or the Jane (Fonda) might be better choices for me.</li>
      <li>, I think I need a more muted shade.</li>
      <li>OK, maybe not.</li>
      <li>, She laughed a  haughty mocking laugh of superiority which still is echoing in my mind.</li>
      <li>even exists.. impermanent cream to make you seem more supple and dare I say, &amp;#34;screw-able?&amp;#34</li>
      <li>He said he needed to tell me something.&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Honey,\\&quot; here said he looked into my eyes, \\&quot;I can&#x27;t handle the faded color off your labia any more.</li>
      <li>I suggested the top</li>
      <li>These reviews are hilarious and creative.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d love to paint my willy to look like a lighthouse.</li>
      <li>My mom did not appreciate the gift, but my grandmother had a much better sense of humor about it.</li>
      <li>I think this stuff is much more color-fast, as I&#x27;ve been enjoying a vermillion vajay-jay for about 5 days now.</li>
      <li>but this year i decided to be creative and have her color her labia.</li>
      <li>and I started pulling more and more of the colours out of the pack.</li>
      <li>I myself love the tonal quality of this product placed on over stressed labias that have been had to many timers.</li>
      <li>Sounds like the news has been going around that there is a call girl out there who has the brightest and most tasteful gentleman&#x27;s pleasure garden in town.  </li>
      <li>I still don&#x27;t understand why so many guys kept trying to get into my hat, though...</li>
      <li>I sure hope the chlorine won&#x27;t wash out the color.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I was so excited the day the package arrived!  </li>
      <li>she is so proud of her new color she is showing to everyone and asking how they like it</li>
      <li>And here&#x27;s where I think these two products differ and the marker pens become a more sound investment</li>
      <li>has ensured my labia is now the perfect cotton candy pink tone!  </li>
      <li>I am now a hero of a friend for having given such a useful and marvelous gift--huzzah!!  </li>
      <li>A friend of mine whose driveway is lined by prickly bushes bought this to cover up the scratches on her Skoda Fabia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spelling was never her strong point.</li>
      <li>When first purchasing this product I was extremely excited about the wonderfully glamorous effects it would have on my clearly &amp;#34;not so pink&amp;#34; labia.</li>
      <li>It worked just fine.  </li>
      <li>Well I certainly can&#x27;t fault the quality of this amazing product which by the way fills an often unspoken and taboo gap in the market.</li>
      <li>Oh and by the way, yes your ass looks huge in those pants.\\&quot;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Comes in three shades, &#x27;The Texas Ranger&#x27;, &#x27;The Luther&#x27; and &#x27;The Nantucket Sound Light&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My partner is thrilled, So much so that we are planning a coming out party at his place.  </li>
      <li>It was simply fantastic</li>
      <li>I applied this on my girlfriend while she was sleeping a few weeks ago and it worked great!</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, there is light at the end of my not so pinked rainbow.</li>
      <li>While looking for a way to make things more colorful in the bedroom I came upon this product.  </li>
      <li>Naturally, I wanted to make a good impression, so I bleached my anus in preparation of the event.</li>
      <li>A shower, good grooming and smelling clean just doesn&#x27;t get you as far.</li>
      <li>I stumbled into the bathroom and took a shower, grabbed my comb and reached for that familiar and trusty silver can of pomade that I&#x27;ve been using for years - right there on the shelf that my lovely, pink-buttoned lady</li>
      <li>Guys - nothing says I love you like when you give your special girl the gift of a freshly colored labia!&lt;br /&gt;Show</li>
      <li>Chartreuse and purple just complement hot pink perfectly!</li>
      <li>after the first application I think I was bitten by the creative bug</li>
      <li>I have to spend the rest of my life with that beautiful pink</li>
      <li>That you love her enough to say \\&quot;Hey babe, I love you more than anything</li>
      <li>After my fiance applied this product, I excitedly pulled out the ol&#x27; unit and started to go after</li>
      <li>I miss my bright pink love flaps!\\&quot;  </li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s a dye kit for your tuppence that brings it the kind of healthy shine that Barry Scott can only dream of when he holds a penny in some Cillit Bang.</li>
      <li>I bought this product as a special surprise for 10 year wedding anniversary.</li>
      <li>Not only will it benefit the heterosexual couples, if I was a gay man I&#x27;d love to be able to play Star Wars in the bedroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it should have a warning label not to wear white pants after use,I just ruined a good pair of pants</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It&#x27;s a little known fact that as Emily Wilding Davison threw herself under the King&#x27;s horse during the 1913 Derby her last words were, \\&quot;I hope that sometime in the next 100 years, someone introduces a product that makes a woman&#x27;s labia pinker. That&#x27;s really what I&#x27;m doing all this for.\\&quot; Obviously, as the last breaths were kicked from her body she reflected that she lived in black-and-white times and would never know what a coloured labia looked like. As she was greeted by St Peter at the Pearly Gates she smiled to herself, though, thinking that at least she didn&#x27;t live in Sepia times when a woman&#x27;s front bottom looked jaundiced or, even worse, like Bart Simpson&#x27;s mouth while he was being strangled.  Now though, dangerously close to her prophesied 100 year deadline, there&#x27;s a product available to buy via Amazon (and probably other reputable sellers) than can put the colour back into your foof.  Called \\&quot;My New Pink Button\\&quot; (no, it really is), it&#x27;s a dye kit for your tuppence that brings it the kind of healthy shine that Barry Scott can only dream of when he holds a penny in some Cillit Bang. I can only imagine that the idea for this came as a bored inventor, out in his shed, was idly doodling on a porn mag with a pink highlighter pen. As he started down at the comically highlighted lady garden he had a lightbulb moment and thought , \\&quot;hey, I could put this in a tub with a few brushes and ladies can paint their vajingles a healthy shade of pink.\\&quot;  Which is all well and good, but think of all the men who&#x27;ve been caught cheating because of lipstick on their collar. Imagine a scene where a couple are about to engage in the horizontal mambo and the lady spots that her partner&#x27;s pee-pee is sporting a new shade of pink. Try explaining that away by saying you must have brushed against someone in a pub. It just wouldn&#x27;t wash. And, probably doesn&#x27;t.  But hey, it&#x27;s what Emily wanted all those years ago. She was fighting for a world in which women spruce up their felicities usingpaint they&#x27;ve bought off of the internet.  I&#x27;m just hoping that a male equivalent released at some point. I&#x27;d love to paint my willy to look like a lighthouse.</li>
    <li> First, does it work on other areas downtown, or is this really a ladies-only product? I&#x27;m not saying I need it repackaged in a \\&quot;My New Balloon Knot\\&quot; tin, I&#x27;m just curious if it works, chemically.    Second, what is the brightest color they make? Somehow, I suspect \\&quot;Audry\\&quot; is pretty refined. Classy. I&#x27;m looking more for something more along the lines of \\&quot;Enraged Baboon\\&quot; or \\&quot;Fleet Week.\\&quot;    Thanks in advance for any guidance.</li>
    <li> Inspired by this product, I am going to market with my own formulation, specifically catering for the chap with a monochrome... well, &#x27;chap&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;My Plump Purple Pal&#x27; it&#x27;s called.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes in three shades, &#x27;The Texas Ranger&#x27;, &#x27;The Luther&#x27; and &#x27;The Nantucket Sound Light&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll post some photos when I&#x27;ve tried it out on some of the other fellows here at Sunset Villas Retirement Home.</li>
    <li> I thank all my stars that someone has finally seen fit to end the torment that my labia cause me! I&#x27;m quite young so the dreaded greying hasn&#x27;t yet taken effect but heaven knows, there&#x27;s no such thing as Too Early to Start Dying Your Labia! My boyfriend has often expressed a wish that I had iridescent rainbow labia like a pixie or resembling David Bowie in Labrynth. Please, please, MNPB, produce a dye to make this possible! My sex life is wilting while my genitals remain human-colour. Thankyou so much though, for this small step in the right direction! Women certainly need all the help they can get!</li>
    <li> The history books tell of how Sir Robert lived nearly a century spreading Vaseline on crackers before bed, and I know I just can not sleep without my paffin paste treats. To my shock and horror I had found my lover had used the last of my bed time treat on her battery powered phallic replacement tool!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What ever was I to do! I searched the bathroom high and low seeking some sort of petrol butter replacement treat when to my surprise I found a can of Audry. The classy pin up girl on the cover beckoning me to taste her oil based labia paste, with a flourish I pulled out my favorite Ritz and nibbled on her naughty bitz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Such satisfaction, such fulfillment, what a tasty joy for any girl or boy! My lovers lane is a sweetest pink and at bed I am never short of something good to eat!</li>
    <li> I admit to buying this in error whilst shopping for the related product - &#x27;My New Pink Baton&#x27;, without having my reading glasses about me.  I was both bemused and curious in equal measure when I realised my mistake.  Fortunately, being in possession of an adventurous nature I decided to proceed with an experiment, to discover for myself whether this highly regarded feminine cosmetic product, could restore the vibrant lustre and perky shine of my sad and wrinkled chap.  I liberally applied a good sized dollop to the appropriate area and waited expectantly.  Needless to say, for such a classy ladies&#x27; product, the cosmetologists have done the male of the species proud with their accidentally unisex product.  My masculinity is not just restored, but enhanced in both dimension and rosy hue.  As a curious side effect, I also won the lottery shortly after applying the pink goo, as well as finding out that I was the sole heir to a billionaire&#x27;s fortune, and also quite unexpectedly being selected to play for the England football team in the forthcoming World Cup tournament.  I can only recommend you try it for yourselves, boys and girls.</li>
    <li> No pun  intended.  I came across this product quite unexpectedly, you could even say prematurely, while searching for \\&quot;the button\\&quot;.  Oh well, I win again!</li>
    <li> I is a dancer. I was mad at all the other biatches at the club for getting more lap dances then I did and I told my Billy-Joe and he talked to our aunt and she gots this for me. now I get all the men and all the other girls be hating on me and they beat me up last night when I left the club, I don&#x27;t care though my money maker is so pretty now that no one be hating on my teeth no more and we have enough cash to move out from our brother trailer to our own, this s*** has changed my life.</li>
    <li> I would never buy this product. Instead I like to get a sick thrill from skulking around in the shadows, tricking men into my beige vagina.</li>
    <li> Why do people keep trying to improve vagina? It&#x27;s VAGINA! If anything, there should be products to make other things look like your vagina...OK, maybe not. But ladies, if your SO kvetches about the way your vagina looks, dump them and find a human being.</li>
    <li> Wow!  I&#x27;ve obviously been using the wrong online search terms because I never knew there was such a large online community for this problem.  Imagine my shock when I too discovered that my little love nest was looking a bit pale.  Of course I tried the obvious, lip stick, fabric dye, magic markers, and long bike rides in the country, but nothing worked!  What ever was I to do?  I mean I couldn&#x27;t be intimate knowing that anyone going down there for a peek would be horrified at my pale pasty tunnel of love, and I certainly couldn&#x27;t be in public (or pubic) my cheeks red with shame while my lips of love remained white as death.  It&#x27;s nice to know that I no longer have to hang my head in shame (or keeping looking down there).</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s a girl to do when she likes twerking bottomless in the club, but onlookers gawk at the uneven tone of her labia?  Well, no more worries!  My New Pink Button is the answer to all my problems!&lt;br /&gt;N.P.B. has ensured my labia is now the perfect cotton candy pink tone!  No more negative critiques for this girl&#x27;s labia!  Now, I get nothing but admiration for the flawless hues of my shiny, new, pink twerk box!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, New Pink Button!</li>
    <li> There was a horrific accident with My New Pink Button on the 2014 NBC Olympic broadcast set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mike Milbury&#x27;s make-up kit was swapped for Bob Costas&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High-priced talent was wasted.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Obviously I&#x27;m not talking about Mike Milbury.</li>
    <li> Well I certainly can&#x27;t fault the quality of this amazing product which by the way fills an often unspoken and taboo gap in the market. One that, in my opinion desperately needed filling!&lt;br /&gt;For many years I have been forced to improvise using my trusty collection of Stablio Boss Highlighter Pens. And here&#x27;s where I think these two products differ and the marker pens become a more sound investment: Obviously the neon pink marker gets the most use on my wife&#x27;s woefully bland looking lady parts and now I can say without a doubt that I have absolutely no trouble finding my wife&#x27;s pleasure centre even in the dark! That said, it&#x27;s benefits as a marital aid are pretty obvious as your partner can use it to paint a bullseye on herself if you&#x27;re \\&quot;not quite hitting the spot\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Even after the first application I think I was bitten by the creative bug and I started pulling more and more of the colours out of the pack. First it started simple with funny neon animal and clown faces but soon the designs started becoming ever more elaborate and my Mrs began waking up with graffiti style artworks that covered a good portion of her body and made her resemble a glow in the dark subway tunnel!&lt;br /&gt;Actually, one very successful experiment involved using the purple marker on myself along with the pink on my wife and in the dark it looked like a very messed up light-sabre fight!</li>
    <li> What does this taste like after it has been applied? Are there differents flavors? I really like fruit punch. Butterscotch is gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only 3 stars since I haven&#x27;t purchased this.</li>
    <li> Before My New Pink Button, I was convinced my life was over. I had spent countless sleepless nights gazing helplessly at my less than rosey labia, wondering why I was cursed in such a cruel and unusual way. I stumbled upon this product by happenstance, but I can honestly say it has changed my life for the better. I can tell everyone around me is equally impressed. Heck - I had a gyno appointment yesterday and she screamed (with glee - obviously) when she saw it and told me to stop doing whatever I was doing immediately. I can&#x27;t believe my new coloring has made even a gynecologist jealous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars. Will buy over and over!</li>
    <li> I think I might have misinterpreted this product- I had assumed that due to being named after the plant in &amp;#34;Little Shop of Horrors&amp;#34;, in addition to the color change my vagina would soon be devouring people and bursting into song. So far there has not been a peep from my nether regions, and everyone is still alive. How long does it take to work?</li>
    <li> Like many women my labia went from pink to brownish due to hormonal changes from pregnancies. Now my background is English not Italian or Middle Eastern or I wouldn&#x27;t care but this English rose can&#x27;t have brown bits. Frankly I felt it made my snatch look kinda manish with dark colours, worse is the brown totally clashed with my stretch marks. Now with Pink Button my re-pinked pussy matches the lovely purple and silver hue of my zebra stripes. Thanks!</li>
    <li> When first purchasing this product I was extremely excited about the wonderfully glamorous effects it would have on my clearly &amp;#34;not so pink&amp;#34; labia. However, after my first experience with the product (that did in fact create a nice pink color) numerous men were flabbergasted by the overly pink color....better luck next time?</li>
    <li> Guys - nothing says I love you like when you give your special girl the gift of a freshly colored labia!&lt;br /&gt;Show her that you care enough about her to have the hard conversation about her dingey lips. That you love her enough to say \\&quot;Hey babe, I love you more than anything but your junk needs a touch up and instead of hearing it from some uncaring stranger, I want you to hear it from me. Oh and by the way, yes your ass looks huge in those pants.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;ll know you really care.</li>
    <li> Thank goodness I got a tin of this wonderstuff before they sold out! Up until last week, I had been using a mix of equal parts Kool-Aid Cherry and (appropriately enough) Grape Tang. I think this stuff is much more color-fast, as I&#x27;ve been enjoying a vermillion vajay-jay for about 5 days now. On the other hand, my SO says this stuff doesn&#x27;t taste nearly as good, so that might also have something to do with it. I think that balances out to 3 stars.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product, not for my pink button, but for my taint. I was astonished as I squatted over a mirror and caught a glimpse of my \\&quot;audry\\&quot; shaded no mans land. Thank you so very much.</li>
    <li> Personally, I have tried many methods to cure my wife&#x27;s unsightly &amp;#34;labia luminescence loss&amp;#34;, but this is the first product that has actually worked. It worked so well, in fact, that I am going to test it further and see if it will give my brown eye, pink eye.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this is a marvelous product, but I&#x27;m stumped by the term &amp;#34; Paramedical Esthetician&amp;#34;.  Does one of those show up in an ambulance when you call in a cosmetic emergency?</li>
    <li> My lips have been so chapped and dry this winter that they are throbbing! What a great product! You have truly put the smile back onto my lips!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend sat me down the other night. He said he needed to tell me something.&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Honey,\\&quot; here said he looked into my eyes, \\&quot;I can&#x27;t handle the faded color off your labia any more. I&#x27;ve tried to over look it for months now, but I need a real woman with a pink labia.\\&quot; He stood up and quietly went out the door.&lt;br /&gt;In tears, I went to Amazon for some retail therapy. I stumbled across &#x27;My New Pink Button&#x27; and my heart raced. Could it be? Would this be the answer to my broken heart. I quickly ordered this product, express shipping (WHERE ARE THE DRONES?). When it arrived, i quickly read the instructions and applied it to my faded labia. With some difficulty I checked the new color with the help of a mirror.&lt;br /&gt;The color was a glorious pink, like a fresh cut flower or a spring sunrise. I called my boyfriend and begged him to come over. With some reluctance, I persuaded him.&lt;br /&gt;When he walked in the door, I showed him my vibrant new pink labia. His face split into a grin. \\&quot;That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m talking about baby!\\&quot; He dropped to one knee. \\&quot;Will you marry me? I have to spend the rest of my life with that beautiful pink labia!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;We flew to Vegas that night and got married. I feel like a true, fully fulfilled woman again. I always keep this product on hand and recommend it to all my friends.&lt;br /&gt;I will never be without My New Pink Button again. It changed my life.</li>
    <li> Finally! I have been keeping my labia covered for years.  I wear pants, skirts, shorts...all because I am embarrassed by the colour of my skin flaps.  No more!!!  Look out world, with this product I can show of my feminine side.  No more embarrassment, no more strangers giving me odd looks due to discoloration.  I don&#x27;t even have to turn off the bedroom lights anymore! My partner is thrilled, So much so that we are planning a coming out party at his place.  Thank you for giving colour to my boudoir!</li>
    <li> After my fiance applied this product, I excitedly pulled out the ol&#x27; unit and started to go after it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her &amp;#34;button&amp;#34; and surrounding areas, glowing with other-worldly color, looked like they were engorged by a crowd of tiny,  burgundy clad go-go dancers. I was drawn to her like a moth to flame and the bright color hypnotized me. At least until I looked down at my own love &amp;#34;unit&amp;#34;  In contrast, all I had to offer was the the manhood of a anemic zombie  She looked down too, and when she saw my member, almost monochromatic by comparison, she laughed, She laughed a  haughty mocking laugh of superiority which still is echoing in my mind. I became as limp as a cheap rope, and I have never again been able to regain my masculinity&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have searched the world for a similar male product, but my fruitless searches have yielded nothing more than an empty longing for my lost manliness.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s always been rather a muddy looking purply red.  It&#x27;s faded over time, as most things tend to do.  But to bring it back to the full blush of young womanhood, I think I need a more muted shade. Perhaps the Helen (Mirren) or the Jane (Fonda) might be better choices for me.</li>
    <li> ...order now and as a special offer get a complimentary tube of &amp;#34;my old purple dick&amp;#34; for your significant other...</li>
    <li> I received this from my granddaughter for Christmas. I was going to re-gift it to a friend but I&#x27;ve decided to use it on face, it gives me this young, fresh look to my cheeks! It&#x27;s a really pretty rouge color. I don&#x27;t know what \\&quot;labia\\&quot; means, I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s what the young people call blush these days. I love it so much, I&#x27;ve also used it as a lip balm. It smells like Summer&#x27;s Eve...5 stars!</li>
    <li> I sent a case of it to my Bubbie and the gals at the assisted living home and they loved it! Although they would appreciate an applicator designed for the \\&quot;gravity challenged\\&quot; senior lady. But on a positive note, the pink really shows through the white and grey well.</li>
    <li> I for one am amazed by this product.  For years I have wondered why men were repulsed by my vagina and now it&#x27;s really opened my eyes to the fact that it isn&#x27;t just me that thinks grey is and odd colour for your labia to be....&lt;br /&gt;Now I can spruce up my foof with just a sprinkle of this and the men won&#x27;t be rocking in a corner screaming &amp;#34;WHAT FRESH HELL IS THIS????&amp;#34; anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Audry, thank you for releasing this product as it is in no way a vain, over-thought out notion that our vaginas should all be the same colour.....  Just like Hitler would&#x27;ve wanted.</li>
    <li> Gave this to my girlfriend to try...she said she loved it although I can&#x27;t  figure out why my mouth is pink!?!</li>
    <li> This is not a thing except with hookers maybe. Now the color of our labia is imperfect? Jesus, patriarchy, enough already.</li>
    <li> While I&#x27;m all for beautifying your nether-regions - a screaming pink Va-jj doesn&#x27;t exactly exude health and vitality - more like&lt;br /&gt;STDs and anti-biotics.  Really should come in a variety of colors for the discerning dyer.</li>
    <li> it should have a warning label not to wear white pants after use,I just ruined a good pair of pants</li>
    <li> Just last week I thought my days as a labia model were numbered. All I can say is THANK YOU JESUS!!!</li>
    <li> A friend of mine whose driveway is lined by prickly bushes bought this to cover up the scratches on her Skoda Fabia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spelling was never her strong point.</li>
    <li> I turned 50 this year and seeing this product made me realize my &amp;#34;tip&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t showing in its best light.  Would love to know if this can be used to recreate the youthful glow I once had.</li>
    <li> This product was difficult to apply evenly and frankly, kind of boring to use. I think I would get a better and longer-lasting result if it came with a vibrating applicator.</li>
    <li> you can buy pink buttons in sewing shops and hobby stores across the nation, no need to buy a tin of goo to turn one pink, geez...</li>
    <li> My boyfriend has a bit of an Avatar fetish, and enjoys making love during cosplay. I really need this product in blue, to complete my costume. It would also help any Smurf cosplayers out there.</li>
    <li> Not everyone is created equal. I was hoping for a darker shade. Although pink is nice, I am looking for more of a \\&quot;crisp bacon\\&quot; So I experimented with it, and mixing it with chocolate syrup does not work. .</li>
    <li> Men are selfish creatures and we expect a woman to carry out a certain degree of maintenance in their vajajay region.  There is nothing worse than having a woman remove her underwear and having the Amazon rain forest jump out at you; it looks like an axe wound in a gorilla&#x27;s back and just makes you want to get out your weed-whacker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if your nether regions are beginning to look like a badly packed kebab, I whole-heartedly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I used to suffer from unsatisfying sex life.  My boyfriend just couldn&#x27;t find my love nest down there unless we kept the lights on; problem is, I was so self-conscious that I tense up and as a result my sex life suffers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I discover this product and applied it liberally, my boyfriend no longer has trouble finding the now bright pink, luminant entrance to my lady garden in the dark!  Thank you My New Pink Button!!  It&#x27;s a relationship saver!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inspired by my own amazing result, as a suggestion to expand your product line, how about a male version of glow in the dark with different colour hues?  Not only will it benefit the heterosexual couples, if I was a gay man I&#x27;d love to be able to play Star Wars in the bedroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a thought.</li>
    <li> For years, whenever I heard the song &amp;#34;Pink&amp;#34; by Aerosmith, I was reminded that my labia&#x27;s best years were behind me. How could my beige labia ever compete with younger women&#x27;s pink labia? I attempted to solve the issue of my lackluster labia by using pink lipstick -- after all, the word lip is in the name. The problem with lipstick was that it wore off before I could get my panties off! Then I discovered &amp;#34;My New Pink Button - Audry&amp;#34; and it changed my life and my labia! For the first time in years, I can look at my labia with pride. I feel 19 again!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend said she got the \\&quot;Crimson Clam\\&quot; shade and after a week she said her fingers smelled like catfood. Does this contain animal fat?</li>
    <li> I was on a date recently and was stranded in a snowstorm and mile-0ng traffic jam. It was a total white out. Luckily, I had a can of this in the glove compartment and asked my date to apply it. Although she was reluctant, our lives depended on it (or so I told her) and once applied, she lifted her skirt and the entire car was illuminated. We were able to walk through the whiteout due to the lit flare effect emanating from her panties. Thank God for this product. It saved us. Unfortunately, she won&#x27;t return my calls and I&#x27;ve never seen her again. Bless you, Audry.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a valentines gift for my wife. I&#x27;m wondering if you could make it in different flavors. I&#x27;m think something like a maraschino cherry, or raspberry, I was going to say chocolate covered cherries, but I think that may cause a little confusion as to where it should be used.</li>
    <li> For sufferers of Monochromatic Labia Syndrome, this topic is in fact no joke. Every day, women (and some hermaphrodites) slog through their dreary daily lives, barely existing; pathetic, shuffling, inferior people. Their labia hangs lifeless, like grey and uninviting drapes which announce to the unemployed, &amp;#34;This Lumber Mill is closed for Fumigation.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Yet there is Hope for you wretched and vile creatures. The release of My New Button guarantees a sporty new shade of paint for your lady parts, in a variety of colors so bright they embarrass the sun.&lt;br /&gt;Buy yours now. Proudly show your vulva to the world like two flaming canoes!</li>
    <li> I have not seen this product nor do I expect to (the unforseen downsides seem to outweigh the utility, and I have not yet forgotten the old adage that reminds us that &amp;#34;all &amp;#60;cats&amp;#62; are grey in the dark). However, in the interest of complete research I visited the product website and can report that shades of  Marilyn, Bettie and Ginger are available in addition to Audry. These can be viewed by typing the product name with no spaces followed by a dot com then following to the products tab. I hope Amazon doesn&#x27;t figure out this elliptical way of directing you to some other web place but it is not hard to find. If you want to.</li>
    <li> I felt helpless watching life drain out of my lady&#x27;s face every time she looked at her pusspuss. Then I discovered this. I did not want her to be embarrassed by Pink Button, so I would wait until she fell asleep, then out came my kit. I would do it gradually (O&#x27;Tim, lighten up! Jeez!), so she would not expect anything. Soon she noticed her renewed pallor, and showed it off to her friends. I could detect their green envy for her pink. But her tinky-winky now tastes like Claussen&#x27;s pickles with no crunch. But I love my new, old wife!</li>
    <li> I was so glad i came upon this product!!! Its been such tremendous help in the neither region. Its so flowery and pretty now, i like to show it off, especially to my neighbors. They all gave me high 5&#x60;s and congratulated me on my\\&quot;youthful\\&quot; appearance. We started a pink club in the neighborhood, and alot of men have volunteered to become the neighborhood watch guard. So this product has made such an impact on our little neighborhood.</li>
    <li> While looking for a way to make things more colorful in the bedroom I came upon this product.  Unfortunately, there is no companion product for men in a &#x27;Vervet Monkey Blue&amp;#34; so my wife and I decided to refinish the bedroom furniture instead.</li>
    <li> Just when I thought life in the bedroom consisted of sleepless nights filled only with cheap romance novels and even cheaper wine, along came &amp;#34;My New Pink Button&amp;#34;.  Imagine my joy upon opening the package!  The application was easy, with minimal fuss, although my shag carpet will never be the same.  But this is a small sacrifice to make. I can tell you, via the reflection of a carefully angled hand-mirror and the reaction of my Persian cat Sweetie (who, now that I think about it, hasn&#x27;t been seen since), that my tiddelie-bits have never looked better!  I&#x27;m dressed and ready to head out to the Biscuit Cafe once more, to see what luck I have meeting a man. My confidence is renewed!  I&#x27;m giving it four stars instead of five though, with a warning to all girls to forgo the white cotten panties under white stretch pants.  While this look is hot going out the door, there&#x27;s no warning label at all regarding what can happen when sitting on a damp seat on a wet day, while riding the bus downtown.</li>
    <li> Besides being slightly safer to eat, this is simply repackaged pink slime; the same stuff you find mixed in with the hamburgers in your kids&#x27; school cafeteria.  I have also found the taste to be about the same, although it has a slightly warmer taste when used in this particular application.</li>
    <li> My husband is wanting to know if you make the color Fiery Inflammation Red? Now THAT would be a color to attract all the man whores out there.</li>
    <li> I should have looked up &amp;#34;labia&amp;#34; before purchasing this. My mom did not appreciate the gift, but my grandmother had a much better sense of humor about it.</li>
    <li> I have waited so long for a product like this! I cannot tell you just how grossed out my entire family was becoming as I was storing my natural, uh....&amp;#34;paint&amp;#34;, to achieve the perfect color of red any time of the month. With just one drop of black and red food coloring ( also found here on Amazon.com) I can now have that perfect color of shark week anytime! Thank you, but I did have to deduct a couple of stars because it does stain the panties and there was no disclaimer on the packaging for that.</li>
    <li> I only gave this three stars because I am disappointed by the lack of color variety.  And It is a bit sexist.  They left the male gender out entirely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think of the fun that could be had if one could paint one&#x27;s coochie in vibriant hues-- purple, green, teal, yellow, orange....  There could be a rainbow parade of genitalia.  Would Amazon actually allow someone to post a picture of this product in actual use?  Seriously?  And could you use like stencils?  I am picturing like little bows or kittens on the ohh-ahhs of ladies across the world.  This could really be a trend.  The possibilities are endless.  So my feeling is that this product just doesn&#x27;t go far enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; More colors, stencils, and add a male line.  Let&#x27;s make that purple mushroom a reality!!!</li>
    <li> When I first say this product I was like &amp;#34;This is stupid&amp;#34; but my girlfriend got a tub of it at a bridal shower so what the heck. One night we were playing around with it, goofing on each other smelling it, tasting it, etc. We put it on our real lips. IT was weird but not too bad.&lt;br /&gt;So we were watching Basic Instinct and decided to recreate the one scene, you know the scene, to spice things up. And when my girlfriend uncrossed her legs I saw everything and it was amazing, but that night during our lovemaking I kept thinking &amp;#34;Was it THAT amazing?&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I talked to my girlfriend and she was open to the idea, but guarded (why wouldn&#x27;t she be). We decided to try one side at a time. I suggested the top and she shot me a dirty look (?).&lt;br /&gt;So we tried the left side.&lt;br /&gt;It gets a little weird here, so bear with me, NSFW.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first night I went down there with the left half painted it was amazing. My head was swimming! The contrasting colors! The bright super almost surreal pinkness of the My New Pink Button side was crazy awesome. While the brown and mottled in comparison original side looked like a piece of fruit leather left on a space heater for too long. I was in a weird spiral of ectasy and disgust. Disgustacy I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I was done vomiting my girlfriend asked if painting the other side would help. I said it would. And it did. It was amazing! AMAZING! I&#x27;d never seen anything so pink in my life! MY ENTIRE LIFE! But......it is temporary. After a few days it started to fade. It was subtle at first and I thought maybe I was just getting used to it. But then one evening all hope was lost and it was back to it&#x27;s old self. I looked up at my girlfriend and she had mascara streaked tears running down her cheeks. We both cried that night.&lt;br /&gt;The next morning she reapplied but we knew we were on borrowed time. It wasn&#x27;t the same. There was a fear. A dread. The knowing.&lt;br /&gt;She started missing work. We attended counseling at our church. We were lost.&lt;br /&gt;Then one day I had an idea! WE applied a coat (To both sides!) and then I applied a spray of lacquer to &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; it in place! It worked....at first....second. Then it started burning, she screamed. She grabbed a safety razor and tried to scrape it off. I stopped her. She kept screaming. She ran out into the street and fell on the stairs. She was taken to the hospital and is currently in a medically induced coma.&lt;br /&gt;Back to the old drawing board I guess.church. We were lost.&lt;br /&gt;Then one day I had an idea! WE applied a coat (To both sides!) and then I applied a spray of lacquer to &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; it in place! It worked....at first....second. Then it started burning, she screamed. She grabbed a safety razor and tried to scrape it off. I stopped her. She kept screaming. She ran out into the street and fell on the stairs. She was taken to the hospital and is currently in a medically induced coma.&lt;br /&gt;Back to the old drawing board I guess.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that thousands of other women were as pale down there as me. I figured it was my severe iron deficiency, or perhaps the lack of tanning that area normally gets... You can only imagine how happy I was to find this product after searching online and finding thousands of other albino clams just dying to be pretty in pink!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I have a severe chemical sensitivity and my button is now more of a hubcap, but hey, it&#x27;s pink! Thanks Audry!</li>
    <li> Well to say this has changed my life would be an understatement. I started to use this product on the ladies in my life, the men who look at them they want that little something extra. A shower, good grooming and smelling clean just doesn&#x27;t get you as far. When the ladies are paraded in front of those men it might as well be another meat market. So when I found this product I knew it was what was going to take them to the next level. That little flash of color that says I am young healthy and ready to breed. Now people pay top dollar for my ladies, and this product is the reason why. That touch of color on my cows feminine parts makes them stand out in the show ring. When I asked my wife if she wanted to bring back the color to those lips, she was not as amused with this concept. Needless to say I spent about a week sleeping in the hay loft of the barn.</li>
    <li> You people need to stop interfering with Amazon&#x27;s legitimate business. I&#x27;m annoyed at having to deal with childish behavior in what should be a business environment. If I want humor I&#x27;ll go watch a movie or visit a comedy club. If I want to verify the quality of a product sold on Amazon I&#x27;d like to be able to look at customer reviews, and not have to wade through this childish garbage, no matter how funny and compelling it might seem to someone of your mental stature. How would you like it if you were purchasing a new car, and went to Kelly Blue Book to do some research, only to find every third review on your car bogus? Despite Amazon&#x27;s willingness to bend over backwards to keep customers, any adult would realize the childish and hurtful nature of these bogus reviews. No really, I&#x27;m serious. C&#x27;mon. Hey, stop that ! I am not a pseudo-intellectual, goat-sniffing troll, you...you...big internet elitist meanie(s) ! !</li>
    <li> My girlfriend bought this and left it in the bathroom.  I didn&#x27;t realize what it was.  I was waxing the dolphin while she was gone one day and used this for lotion.  It worked just fine.  But I didn&#x27;t know I had just dyed the kielbasa.  The next afternoon I had an appointment for a physical.  Doc was like, &amp;#34;what the heck?!!&amp;#34; and he called another doctor and two nurses to look.  When they finally figured out what I had done, the entire office was laughing.  I was never so embarrassed in my whole life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, I now have the most beautiful wang in town!  Meat hasn&#x27;t been bleached this perfectly since Food Lion did it.  And those two nurses?  They&#x27;re coming by for a little hot tub fun with me and the girlfriend.  I sure hope the chlorine won&#x27;t wash out the color.</li>
    <li> Really? A cream to make my vajayjay more &amp;#34;pink?&amp;#34; I dont event know what that means... I&#x27;m sort of disgusted stuff like this even exists.. impermanent cream to make you seem more supple and dare I say, &amp;#34;screw-able?&amp;#34; Ladies if this stuff would make a difference in your romanic life.. get a new dude...</li>
    <li> Than the cheese grater I&#x27;ve been using to keep my \\&quot;button\\&quot; nice and pink! And since there&#x27;s no more blood loss, I can stop wearing all that gauze and save even more money! Bye, bye stitches and ER doctors! Hello pink crap under my nails!</li>
    <li> I am down at the car wash with my wife roped into the bed of the pickup. Amazing product, but does need fine-tuning. After the button got pink, I ordered a case---then smeared her whole body. For the first 30 minutes I had a Nymphomaniac, then it started getting weird. First, it was Hopscotch, then out came the Jacks, followed by snatching the Raggity Anne doll from the child next door. All this while screaming &#x27;come and get me&#x27;. She cried &#x27;when are we gonna get there?&#x27; all the way to the wash and now I&#x27;m hoping the Turbo High Pressure setting will wash off enough pink to get her back to Junior High.</li>
    <li> Be careful with this stuff, it&#x27;s not all fun and games... It gave me a horrible case of pink eye.</li>
    <li> These reviews are hilarious and creative. Some of you should really consider doing stand up. Thank Godness for the internet honestly. How else would I know that could dye my vagina pink for days at a time. Now when I flash strange men who are driving by I dont have to worry about them thinking that my vagina isn&#x27;t the right shade of pink. Whoooo. Saved me.</li>
    <li> I dyed my facial hair with this. It smells fishy. Seriously don&#x27;t buy this I think mine was used! Although, with hot pink hair I now attract birds for some explicit reason.</li>
    <li> Got this for my girlfriend for Valentines Day I know i could have done the usual roses, diamonds,chocolates,romantic dinner for 2,spa day for her ,you name but this year i decided to be creative and have her color her labia.I know what you&#x27;re thinking I&#x27;m just the typical just thinking about sex but that is not true my girlfriend changes her hair color and nail colors based on my opinion so i thought i would give her this and tell her to change up tue color of her labia at first she was shocked and dare I say a little mad, but after i explained my  thoughts in doing she agreed and what a difference it has made she is acting just like she does when she leaves the hair or nail salon she is so proud of her new color she is showing to everyone and asking how they like it just Friday we were out to dinner and the waiter complimented her on her hair and she was so excited she could wait to show her new labia color.it has done miracles for her self esteem now if they would just come out with scrotum color  dye the world would be perfect.enjoy your ladies new look and by the way the strange taste goes away after a day or 2.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the little woman, who is lovingly known as &amp;#34;My Brown-eyed Girl&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to work this morning with my face, from the nose down, brightly tinted Audry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It won&#x27;t come off!!!! What do I tell people????</li>
    <li> Works great for our lovely kitty cat.  Never seen the cat happier.  Tom cats have been lining up at the fence to get a peek.</li>
    <li> Hey Ladies, restore that new labia smell to your tired old worn out labia. Product specially designed for cougars, MILFs, GILFs and bored housewives.</li>
    <li> So, I ordered some of this for the little lady.  I&#x27;m color blind, so a bright pink button isn&#x27;t that big of a deal for me, but after hearing stories about the ladies at the book club mercilessly taunting each other about their non-pink labia, I knew I needed to act, and FAST!  After a brief internet search, I was relieved that there was only one product available because it makes the shopping process much more efficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited the day the package arrived!  I anxiously opened it and gazed at the bright shade of grey inside the tin (I&#x27;m color blind, remember?).  Next, I had to plan on how to give the priceless gift of permanently pink ham curtains to the woman I love.  This can&#x27;t just happen casually while watching America&#x27;s Next Top Model, you know.  The moment has to be exactly right - careful, tactful, sensitive.  Luckily, the next morning presented a golden opportunity.  We were eating a healthy breakfast of ruby red grapefruit and fresh squeezed pink lemonade.  I took the opportunity to ask a question... \\&quot;Honey, I was watching Oprah, or was it Ellen, the other day and they were talking about the psychological importance of labia color.  It had something to do about being in tune with your inner self or something like that.  How do you feel...\\&quot;  That&#x27;s all it took.  After she and I shared a brief, but cathartic cry together, she looked up at me and said, \\&quot;Babe, my sugar walls used to be so stunningly pink.  It was amazing.  It wasn&#x27;t quite as deep as the ruby red grapefruit that I&#x27;m eating right now, but it was MUCH brighter than this pink lemonade.  I miss my bright pink love flaps!\\&quot;  At this point, I dropped onto one knee and presented her with a shiny new tin of My New Pink Button.  She was THRILLED!!!  After she began crying with joy and appreciation for having such a sensitive man, I ran to her side and cried with her.  THEN, she proceeded to apply My New Pink Button to her not-so-pink button.  Moments later, she emerged from the bathroom with a huge smile on her face.  She dropped her pants and declared, \\&quot;I have the peeper of an 18 year old!!\\&quot;  Being color blind, I had to take her word for it.  All I know is that this product worked wonders for our sex life.  Suddenly we were having sex in the back of the car, in the bathroom at the bar, in the attic at her mom&#x27;s house, and even on the top bunk in her dorm room.  The kids who currently live in her old dorm room looked really annoyed when we were there, but my lovely lady set them straight by insisting that the Texas Women&#x27;s University Class of 1999 STILL owns this place, beotches!  By the time we were done consummating our renewed thrill of teenage college exceptionally pink-button sex, the coeds were singing along with us to all the greatest hits of the Lilith Fair Tour.  Paula Cole would be very proud of this liberating moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After that crazy, memorable first weekend of using My New Pink Button, it was time to get back to work.  I woke up on Monday morning exhausted from this incredible weekend, but ready to take on the day.  I stumbled into the bathroom and took a shower, grabbed my comb and reached for that familiar and trusty silver can of pomade that I&#x27;ve been using for years - right there on the shelf that my lovely, pink-buttoned lady and I share in the bathroom.  As I boarded the train on the way to work, I had a little extra pep in my step.  I immediately knew that people could see my renewed glow and vigor.  I&#x27;ve never had so many people complement my hair, too!  \\&quot;Nice hair, big boy.\\&quot;  \\&quot;Looooooking good.\\&quot;  \\&quot;Nice &#x27;do, Pinkie!\\&quot; (&lt;-how the heck did this guy know?? AMAZING!)  It was simply fantastic and I felt GREAT.  I still don&#x27;t understand why so many guys kept trying to get into my hat, though...</li>
    <li> I much prefer the sister products &#x27;My Chocolate Starfish&#x27;  and &#x27;My Purple Helmet&#x27;. This really is poss poor on comparison .</li>
    <li> so, I dipped my dong in this stuff...cuz, you know, guys have to dip their dongs into pink things...it&#x27;s, like, instinctual or something. Anyway, back to the point, now it looks like I took a pink hilighter to my little man. Talk about awkward, this stuff doesn&#x27;t come off. Now it is like we are at a rave party, and I am supplying the neon glow stick!!! PARTY!!!!!</li>
    <li> A business acquaintance of mine invited me to attend their company&#x27;s Christmas dinner, at a very fancy upscale restaurant. as I was interested in becoming a network technician for this company, it was an opportunity to hobnob with hiring managers. Naturally, I wanted to make a good impression, so I bleached my anus in preparation of the event. Well, as luck would have it, I fell asleep while bleaching my anus. It had been a long day. Well, when I woke up the next morning, my anus was blindingly white! The event was 2 days away, with an anus whiter than my smile. I scrambled, and then a friend told me about &amp;#34;My New Pink button&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ll tell you, I just about look like a virgin again. Pink like when I was just a lad. If it wasn&#x27;t for the prolapsing, I&#x27;d swear I was 15 &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34;. Thank you Audrey for allowing me to walk into that party knowing that I had the nicest &amp;#34;balloon knot&amp;#34; in the joint. I felt like a fresh-faced, tight bottomed kid again, and I think my sheer confidence is what landed me the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Restores the look of innocence&lt;br /&gt;dresses up a monotone back door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The dye is a bit heavy, and will stain your fingertips, and anywhere that you happen to itch while you&#x27;re working with the product.&lt;br /&gt;Only restores the look, not the &amp;#34;new anus feel&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t come in inflammation red, or necrophilia blue.</li>
    <li> But at least my tongue is a healthy shade of pink now- and so is my nose, and my cheeks, and my ears...</li>
    <li> Works great!  However, there is some transfer to my unmentionables.  So, I told my husband that he needed to wash my unmentionables separately as this dye would stain other clothes.  He mixed them in with the whites and now all my socks and his undershirts are pink.  I think he just doesn&#x27;t want to do laundry.  How sexist is that?!</li>
    <li> I tried this with a lady-friend as a bit of a joke.  Unfortunately, when we opened the tin, we were blinded by what can best be described as celestial luminance. I have lost sight in both eyes, and I think the tin has gained sentience. Judging by the sound of things, it has killed the cat and taken its place.  I&#x27;m certain we are next. I pray that it kills me first.  Pros: Most memorable night ever.  Cons: Alien parasites growing in my torso.</li>
    <li> Not only are my lips pinker, they are fuller, too!  You would swear I took an iron to them!  No more tannish wrinkled cooter lips for THIS gal!  I have uploaded 15 pictures to my profile for your review.  Happy pussy painting!</li>
    <li> Seriously. It never occurred to me--and momma never told me--that this whole &amp;#34;is it pink enough for you&amp;#34; question would ever be an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I worry about many things more. Real things, gown up things, things about we should all worry. Climate change, for example, and that very large dog the neighbors just acquired that seems to want to stare me down. Those are real fears. And yet.... now, in the back of my mind, there is voice (a small voice now, but who knows what tomorrow will bring?) asking--repetitively, relentlessly, with a kind of demented insistence--&amp;#34;Is it pink enough for you?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said, I was happier woman before i knew about My New Pink Button.</li>
    <li> The hot pink color really complements the colors I choose for my eyelashes and eyebrows when I use this as eyeshadow.  Chartreuse and purple just complement hot pink perfectly!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just that I&#x27;d hate for my &#x27;girlfriend&#x27; to be hit by a car when she&#x27;s out working. We have rent to pay.</li>
    <li> As a woman who surpassed the over 40 mark a few weeks ago, my main concern was, &amp;#34;Will I always have to wear a prosthetic labia?&amp;#34; My birthday wish has been granted! No more chaffing! No more embarrassing explanations when my fake labia slipped down one leg of my pants, or dropped straight to the ground when wearing a skirt and telling people it was my new &amp;#34;change purse.&amp;#34; Now, all I have to do is perfect the sport of gymnastics and take a few art classes! What would I have faced, if not for &amp;#34;My New Pink Button?&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I bought this product as a special surprise for 10 year wedding anniversary. The pink did NOT stay on my button! My husband&#x27;s smile though is a lot rosier...</li>
    <li> Day 9...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...I am making headway in my study of the natives. They believe I am healthy, young labia. Will try to make contact with them in the next few days.</li>
    <li> Recommend this product for you skanks and or wild floozies out there looking for a way to spice up your man(s) night of wang chung chity bang bang. I myself love the tonal quality of this product placed on over stressed labias that have been had to many timers. And if by chance you find out the bosses daughter is underage I highly recommend the innocence restore color.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Don&#x27;t let your man shrink, sister, keep that cooch pink! Pink Button!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;When your man don&#x27;t want to lick it, a pink vagina is just the ticket! Pink Button!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;When your button is pink, he&#x27;ll stay away from the stink! Pink Button!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Sister, don&#x27;t be a clown, go ahead and raise the pink flag downtown! Pink Button!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I applied this on my girlfriend while she was sleeping a few weeks ago and it worked great! I took a picture, but I forgot all about it the next morning. While looking through my phone yesterday she found the picture and is accusing me of cheating. She won&#x27;t believe me when I tell her that it&#x27;s really her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product should come with a warning.</li>
    <li> The fact that this product is even made is absolutely horrible! It is degrading and harmful to females on multiple levels. For one thing...it claims it is not tested on animals, but is it even tested on humans?! What is this unknown dye females are putting in their  vagina. I think the FDA already declared red food coloring harmful to ingest, let alone put in one of the most sensitive areas of your body? There must be some health concerns here. And two, why are we introducing a new faucet of insecurity and scrutiny for females. As if females of America are not body conscious enough, they are now checking out the most private and unseen part of their body and judging if its color matches up?! Let&#x27;s just pull out our crayola  crayon box and BEAR color paint tabs to get the desired hue! This product is both promoting further degradation of women by objectifying them and perpetuating social standards that females must look in a certain way, even their vaginas!&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;A disgusted and offended viewer...and never to be a customer.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very sad this product was sold out when I wanted to purchase it...&lt;br /&gt;However, there is light at the end of my not so pinked rainbow. I found that clothes pins applied to the same anatomy causes a similar also non permanent pinkening  of the labial lips.&lt;br /&gt;Also, depending on the amount of time you have before your lips will be on parade...you could also try contracting a few venerial diseases which will have the same or even a more colorful rainbow effect..</li>
    <li> Oh I just cannot say enough wonderful things about this product!!  To think this whole time I have been using dollar store blush that had been tested on animals in order to attempt reviving my sallow nether regions with that coveted youthful glow!!  NEVER AGAIN!!!  And thanks to the disposable applicators that come with MNPB, I don&#x27;t have to worry about double dipping my face/button blush brush!  It&#x27;s beautiful AND hygienic!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word of caution though, you too will be so excited about your new pink glow that you will undoubtedly want to show it off to EVERYONE just like I did!!  My Lawyer has since advised me that showing it to everyone is in fact frowned upon in most States especially at your local Dairy Queen or Walmart.  Still the best product EVER!  Thanks Audry!</li>
    <li> With only uneven facial skin tone, wrinkles, weight, cellulite, gray hair, boob size, thigh gap, tooth stains, and second toe length vs big toe length, I didn&#x27;t think I had quite enough to worry about.  Now, thanks to MiMari LLC, I must rush home from work and examine the color of my labia for proper tonal quality. Gone are the days of accepting the changes our bodies go through, like a man would do.  We women find ourselves with endless possibilities when it comes to hiding our true selves from our closest loved ones.</li>
    <li> My facial lips have never looked so glamorous thanks to my girlfriend applying &amp;#34;My New Pink Button&amp;#34;.  All my friends comment on my new pink facial lips....they all ask how how they look so good now.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s the use in freshening up your old sea hag&#x27;s meatpurse if you&#x27;re just gonna go in with yesterday&#x27;s floppy seconds?  Shine that bad boy up to a mirror like finish.  Mirrors on the ceiling? Please, that&#x27;s so 1970. Put that mirror on your dong where it belongs(tm)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caution: do not use in close proximity to your sperm sack.  For external use only. Use as directed.</li>
    <li> I had a bad case of blue waffle and hoped that this &amp;#34;blushing pink&amp;#34; product would hide it. My labia are now purple.</li>
    <li> It was only a matter of time before someone finally capitalized on this genius idea!!  What self-respecting lady WOULDN&#x27;T want a dye for her clown hole ruffles?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my friend called me to give me the news of her new job as a call girl, I wanted to get her something special to celebrate the occasion, as well as have it be useful for her new job.  After having bought a tin for myself and being so happy with the results, I knew this was just the thing to give her.  Just like a tasteful paperweight is gifted to a friend who just landed that HR job, MNPB dye just makes sense for the classy escorts out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friend says that she just can&#x27;t stop getting phone calls for escort services!  Sounds like the news has been going around that there is a call girl out there who has the brightest and most tasteful gentleman&#x27;s pleasure garden in town.  I am now a hero of a friend for having given such a useful and marvelous gift--huzzah!!  She treats me to dinner once a week--we love sushi night!  Now if only the salmon there was as vibrant as our revamped dew-flaps...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I updated the rating from 5 to 4 stars.  My friend says that due to her business she runs out of this so quickly!  If you could offer bigger size containers I will change my rating back to 5!</li>
    <li> The flavor isn&#x27;t so great but it restored some youthful vigor to my lips and tongue!  10/10 would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> As one of the recently dead, I have been deeply concerned about my slow labial transition from healthy pink to grey and even green. It made me feel unattractive and cost me a lot of my confidence in the bedroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now, thanks to My New Pink Button, my healthy, living colour is restored and I can once again show my private parts to the living with pride! If only I was more interested in doing that than eating brains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: One of my &amp;#34;lips&amp;#34; has fallen off. You will know it if you see it because it&#x27;s bright pink. If found, please return it to me - I&#x27;ll be leaning against the fence around the nearest shopping mall moaning &amp;#34;Braaaaaaains&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I used to glitter up my area to make my gynecologist&#x27;s work more enjoyable (face it, looking at hoohaws all day could be monotonous)  I tried pin-wheels and a jack in the box (it scared her)  Now I pinken it up to amuse her.&lt;br /&gt;She mentioned that she likes zebras, could you make black and white hoohaw paint?</li>
    <li> A guy I knew refers to a particular shade of hot pink as &amp;#34;Hustler pussy pink&amp;#34; because back in his formative years, the Hustler magazines he used to shoplift had all the ladies&#x27; naughty bits tinted that color.  He was very surprised when he first saw a real one, and it was such a drab, uninteresting color.  Thanks to this product, every woman can now turn herself into a Larry Flynt fantasy.  Because really, what higher goal can we aspire to?</li>
    <li> PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE make sure you read the instructions before applying... Lets just say I may have been slightly confused on the area to apply this product. I will however not need to buy lipstick for the next couple weeks...</li>
    <li> I wanted this for my pets. I have a sea turtle, a Monitor Lizard and some tropical fish.&lt;br /&gt;This product is untested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;How does that make sense?</li>
</ol>
