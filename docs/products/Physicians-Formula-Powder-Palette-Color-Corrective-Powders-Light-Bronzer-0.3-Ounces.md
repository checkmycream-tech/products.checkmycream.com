      <li>i love this powder!</li>
      <li>I love this bronzer!</li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>I use it along with the Rose Blush palette.</li>
      <li>it gives me a nice tan look, but it doesnt make me look like im covered in it.</li>
      <li>A light bronzer with no sparkle just all over warm color!</li>
      <li>I was glad to have found it on line.  </li>
      <li>Have tried many brands, shades, and types of blush, but always return to Physicians Formula Bronzer.</li>
      <li>Love all the products they make.</li>
      <li>Didnt care for this, wanted more contrast color</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t use as a bronzer as I already have another brand I like better for that.  </li>
      <li>I am brunette with a fair complexion and this is just right.  </li>
      <li>It is light and blends many shades, not just one.</li>
      <li>No awful sparkles, easy to shade and accentuate, and color true to palette.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also really good for sensitive skin and contouring as well.</li>
      <li>I really like this product as it is fairly light bronzer and is not glittery</li>

      <li>This gives your skin just the right amount of color to satisfy a glow during the season.  </li>
      <li>I read some reviews on this product and it was supposed to be good for pale girls.</li>
      <li>but they were very &amp;#34;coppery&amp;#34; and shiny.</li>
      <li>Just about the time you really use a product and it works, POOF,</li>
      <li>Have always found these products to be of high quality, as I&#x27;ve had them before.</li>
      <li>Love it but getting hard to find.</li>
      <li>I tried a few others that said they we light</li>
      <li>Gives a nice overall &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; without the fake look.</li>

    <li> This was a product I had been using that disappeared from my local shelves.  Just about the time you really use a product and it works, POOF, it&#x27;s no longer around.  I was glad to have found it on line.  No more waste in spent money trying to find that just right product all over again.  This gives your skin just the right amount of color to satisfy a glow during the season.  It is light and blends many shades, not just one.</li>

    <li> This is the only bronzer I will use.  I am fair skinned and other bronzers make me look awful, this is the only one I will use.  I like the multi-colors in it and they always blend well.</li>
    <li> To dark for me.  can&#x27;t use as a bronzer as I already have another brand I like better for that.  Won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
    <li> A light bronzer with no sparkle just all over warm color!</li>
    <li> I really like this product as it is fairly light bronzer and is not glittery/shimmery.  Gives me just a bit of extra color.  I am brunette with a fair complexion and this is just right.  I tried a few others that said they we light but they were very &amp;#34;coppery&amp;#34; and shiny.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price!</li>
    <li> Product is OK however, package clearly states it contains a mirror and brush.  I have neither a mirror nor brush.  I consider this false advertising and would never buy another of their products again due to this deception.</li>
