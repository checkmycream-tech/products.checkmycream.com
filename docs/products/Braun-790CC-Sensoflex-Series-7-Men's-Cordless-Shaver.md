      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>what more do you want?</li>
      <li>I bought this shaver (Pulsonic)and after 5 months its vibration was getting more noticable.</li>

      <li>I absolutely love the shave.</li>
      <li>What more could you want?</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The pressure facing health and beauty grooming appliances is tough... they have to constantly think of new and better ways to improve their products, EVEN THOUGH they may have already reached a technological ceiling. It&#x27;s because of the competitive nature of the business. They could make subtle improvements in an existing shaver and price it less, but people won&#x27;t buy it because there isn&#x27;t some compelling difference. So, companies keep trying to invent catch phrases and ambiguous functionality, in order to keep prices up (with the illusion that you&#x27;re getting more if you pay more).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How much better can a foil shaver get? Braun reached a major pinnacle with the 7000 series. The Syncro line was the first introducing a head cleaning system, as well as a faster motor with side-to-side vibration. You take a shave with a 7000 series and this new 7 series, and guess what? You won&#x27;t feel a noticeable difference. A few other reviewers have noticed this as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having been a Braun shaver owner for over 15 years, my latest model is the 8595 Activator. It is the equivalent to the 9595, only being from the previous generation. It has almost everything the 9595 has, except for the new casing design and the indicator that tells you when to change the shaving head cassette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I happened to have a friend who bought one of these and managed to get him to loan it to me for a week (we traded shavers). Guess what? After a week, we compared notes and discovered that we BOTH found the shaving performance identical between the 8595 Activator and the 790cc Pulsonic (9595).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun lauds its \\&quot;new\\&quot; Pulsonic technology, but in essence it is the same technology they&#x27;ve had since the 7000 series. Quite frankly, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth spending an extra $100 to get the Series 7 model. Instead, I&#x27;d buy a new old stock 8595 or 8995 model for about $100 cheaper. Also, you&#x27;ll save quite a bit of money of the long haul on head replacements. The 9595 (790) uses a \\&quot;cassette\\&quot;, which is essentially the foil and cutter block combined into one unit. You cannot buy them separately. You damage the foil? The whole thing requires replacing. Why did Braun do this? Well... to close a loop hole. On the earlier models, you can replace just the cutter block and keep the your current foil. After all, if the foil is undamaged, it is still doing its job. From a shaving outlet, you can buy the 8000 series cutter block for just $10. The 9595 cassette costs $50! You do the math...lly the foil and cutter block combined into one unit. You cannot buy them separately. You damage the foil? The whole thing requires replacing. Why did Braun do this?

    <li> So I&#x27;ve had this shaver for exactly 2 years. Recently my trimmer broke so i called up the braun customer service and they gave me a number to the service location closest to me. I brought in the shaver along with the cleaner housing and charger. I gave them everything and went home. Within a week Braun had shipped directly to my house a brand new shaver and brand new everything else which includes the housing, charger, head, travel case etc. I just want to say that the warranty and customer service was excellent. I would definitely reccomend this product to anyone. Besides the warranty, the 790cc is probably the best shaver on the market, smooth shave, close shave, pivots, sexy looking, and self cleaning - what more do you want? My investment was well worth it. I am extremely happy and will use this one for another several years.</li>
    <li> This unit arrived quickly, but during use the next day it leaked cleanning fluid and really made a big mess in our bathroom.  Not what I would have expectec from a quality product and at this price level. Was given a pretty big hassle over returning it, but did do so.  Then it took almost three weeks to get my money back.  Their \\&quot;policy\\&quot;    Guess they really like the policy of bout now and we get our money today, if something goes wrong then we revert to our other policy.  We will just use you money interest free for awhile.    The people at Amazon do a very good job of customer service, its when you buy from a seller through them you get all of there policys.  I will make sure who I buy from in the future.</li>
    <li> So I have very sensitive skin and if I shave more than once a week with an ordinary straight razor my neck will have small cuts, bumps, and razor burn all over and it looks awefull. I have tried electric razors in the past a couple remingtons, and one Norelco with no luck. It shaved my face fine but didn&#x27;t come close to shaving my neck and if I did it two days straight it would irritate my neck.     So I purchased the Braun 790cc shaver system and so far I am very impressed. It shaves in a quick manner and really isn&#x27;t as loud as some reviews stated. I had prior bumps and cuts on my neck before shaving with the braun for the first time and it shaved my whole face and neck very closely without re-opening those cuts and bumps. It does shave very close almost as close as a blade and thats the truth. If this shaver keeps performing like it has so far it litterally will change my life. I no longer will look like a hobo at work 3 out of the 5 days a week with scruff all over my face. The cleaning system is very nice it cleans fast and quitely. I would deffenitly recommend this product it is expensive but honestly I would pay twice as much if it keeps performing like it is now.</li>
    <li> This is an incredible shaver! Well worth the added price. I&#x27;ve had it for nearly 2 months and I&#x27;m still on the 1st cleaning cartridge. This was one of my concerns, but it cleans itself flawlessly. The expense of the cartridge is a nice luxury in never having to clean the shaver.    It&#x27;s a joy to use and my wife loves the close shaves. Nothing else needs to be said.</li>
    <li> My husband has not had a good shave until we bought this one.  I was nervous about investing in this shaver since we have not had any luck with the previous choices we have made.  He finally switched from a rotary to a foil and he loves it!  No more irratated skin!!  It gives him a closer shave too.</li>
    <li> Orginally I had recieved a rotary shaver, but I&#x27;ve found the Braun foil type shaver to provide a closer shave. There was some initial getting use to the shaver, as it mentions slight irriation my occur in the early stages of using the shaver. But after a couple of weeks its works great. Provides a very close shave, sometimes so close it nicks the skin. But nothing to be concerned about. Makes a great gift for your significant other, - as it was for me.</li>
    <li> Seriously, the best razor that I have ever owned.      Works flawlessly and effectively every time.    I was on the road for 21 days straight and it held a charge the whole time.    Keep in mind that every four to six months you need to replace the foil and three cleaning cartridges last about five months.    So there is upkeep that is required to keep the razor &#x27;fresh&#x27;.    With that being said - what a bloody nice razor.</li>
    <li> This shaver does a great job. It is clean, efficient, overall I give the shaver itself a 5 star.     However, once you use the shaver, you have to put it back into a plastic cleaning dock that cleans the shaving heads and recharges the battery.     The fit of the shaver into the dock is so inadequate that the blue led on the shaver (the one that shows it is charging) sometimes flashes intermittently. (the dock does fantastic light shows while this happens...) You start the cleaning cycle and the shaver vibrates away from the charging contacts. So the cleaning cycle stops. The only reliable way I can get it to clean is to hold the shaver into the dock for 19 minutes. Doesn&#x27;t that defeat the purpose of the electric shaver?     Shaver is great. Cleaning system sucks.</li>
    <li> This is my fourth Braun shaver since switching from Norelco over thirty years ago. I guess I&#x27;ve been pleased with Braun since I keep coming back to them. This one is the best yet. The shave is both close and quick, even on my neck. The sideburn trimmer works well but it took a little getting used to. The cleaning system seems to do a great job. I don&#x27;t know how costly it will be over time as I&#x27;ve only had the shaver for two weeks but it still says the fluid level is high and I use the cleaning system every other day.</li>
    <li> This shaver is simply the best shaver i&#x27;ve ever had. It leaves my skin sooo smooth. I had a 3 yr old Braun but series 8585. It was still good, but i wanted a better one. This shaver will amaze you in how nice and clean it shaves you. It feels of good quality. WORTH every penny. Trust me. It is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to buy one for my dad when it comes time for Fathers Day. He tried it once or twice and he likes it a lot. This shaver shaves super super close. You&#x27;ll look way younger with it, lol.  Now i have a kinda baby face, lol.</li>
    <li> I have owned many electric shaver over the years. Most all have been top of the line Norelco or Braun eclectic shavers. The Braun 9595 is replacing the Braun 8585 Activator that I have used since they first came out.  After only 2 shaves ( a 1 day beard and a heavy 2 day old beard ) I can see I am really going to enjoy this shaver.  My actual shaving time is reduced considerably since the 9595 seems to cut stubborn facial hair on the first pass.  The 9595 gives a smooth fast shave and doesn&#x27;t cause me any skin irritation.  By far the very best electric shaver that I have ever used and I have used dozens over my 65 years.</li>
    <li> I just upgraded from the 8595 360 Braun razor.  This is hands down a better razor.  Gives me a much closer shave with a lot less irritation.  I don&#x27;t know how they did it I thought the other razor was great but this is so much better...hard to explain but buy it forsure!!</li>
    <li> I bought the Braun Series 7 after reviewing several other Braun and other brand razors.  I have had an older Braun razor for several years but it was time to retire it.  I am not disappointed in my new Series 7 razor at all. It gives me outstanding shaves cutting close, including on the neck, without any irritation at all.  I would highly recommend this to anyone. It is a bit pricey but worth every buck.</li>
    <li> I have used a blade to shave since I was 12 years old, 43 years ago. I even used a straight razor for a while 30 years ago. I tried a few electric razors in between when I received one as a gift or just decided I was tired of the nicks and scratches. I would dedicate myself to the Remington or Norelco triple header for months at a time but I invariably would have to finish off each shave with a blade for the hard to reach or shave spots on the face and neck. I would then just go back to the blades and call the experiment a failure.     I would always seem to have a two or three day growth of beard because- 1. I didn&#x27;t like to shave, 2. When I did shave it was a 15 minute ordeal to wash my face, lather up, shave, wash again, dry, then bandage.... well, you know what I mean. My wife was always harping on me to \\&quot;Just shave real quick so you&#x27;ll look nice!\\&quot; There was no &#x27;real quick&#x27; about it.    Finally I decided to try the Braun 790CC/9595 after reading some reviews about them. I have been using it for about three months now. It is TERRIFIC!!! I pop the razor out of it&#x27;s cleaning well, shave (about 2 or 3 minutes- TOPS, pop the razorback in the cleaning well, hit a button, and I&#x27;m done----- in less than 4 minutes. I have a heavy beard, REAL HEAVY. My wife tells everyone I can have a full grown beard in under a week. I am as slick as a babies bottom now- EVERY DAY! My wife kisses me a lot more now and loves to stroke my cheek! The Braun shaver is the best money I ever spent! Thanks Braun and thanks Amazon for the feedback you provide to prospective buyers!

    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with electric shavers for almost 50 years and have been shaving with Braun shavers for more than twenty.  Nothing even comes close to the smoothness of the shave from this wonderful shaver.</li>
    <li> I used this system for about 3 years. The razor gave me a close shave, but I had to work at it. The cleaning equipment was kind of nice. You do need to brush out the whiskers before putting it in the cleaner. I used it after every shave and the razor felt clean and lubricated. Finally the pop-up trimmer broke. I have no idea why. It wasn&#x27;t dropped or otherwise mistreated. When it broke, I decided to try the Norelco 7810. Wow! That razor really does give a close shave with minimal effort. I like it a lot better than the Braun. It is much better than the old Norelco I used before the Braun, too. One thing though: The Norelco&#x27;s pop-up trimmer doesn&#x27;t work worth a darn.</li>
    <li> This is a very good razor which I would give the highest rating from a good company, who I purchased it from with good delivery as promised.I will recommend it to others and will make other purchases as soon as needed.    thanks        edwin cook  Ingram. tx usa</li>
    <li> After the trimmer recently broke (which I rarely use), I discovered that it&#x27;s really just plastic parts held together with metal clips - bad construction for such an expensive piece of equipment. I&#x27;ve had the pulsonic for 2 years and already need to replace the head a second time (before I had the 9585 which I had for at least 3 years and never replaced the head, using it just as much as the pulsonic). The pulsonic shaves really fast but not very close and can almost never get the area above the lips right. One thing that I do like is that the flat neck hairs come out really well. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll go back to the 590 or get another 790. It probably sounds wasteful, but I&#x27;d hesitate returning the unit to Braun and not being sure I&#x27;d get my own unit back rather than a refurbished one for fixing the trimmer. Other things I don&#x27;t like: (1) missing head protector (a plastic cap that you probably remember from older models; why they did away with it is beyond me because the travel case for the pulsonic is huge, I don&#x27;t travel with it and I wish I had something to protect the foil); (2) travel case - the top of the line older models came with a good case (fake leather) that looked stylish; now it&#x27;s just a piece of cheap plastic, doesn&#x27;t fit with a razor at this price point (typical American marketing decision); (3) cord color doesn&#x27;t match the razor - another design snafu; (4) really noisy. Gillette has a lot of work to do to get this one right.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver (Pulsonic)and after 5 months its vibration was getting more noticable. Braun referred me to a service center for repair. Their it sat for about 38 days. I had to really complain and fight for a new shaver. After five phone calls to Braun and four to the repair shop. Braun finally called me and said they were going to send a new replacement. This was a real hassle. For the money I don&#x27;t think the Pulsonic is worth it. I recommend a Panisonic.</li>
    <li> Have had several shavers including Remington and Norelco as well as a few others.  Loved my last Braun but lost it on a trip.  So I bought the 5 series and was not happy with the battery life.  It shaved great though.  Send it back and got the 7 series.  Better closer shave, better battery life, better controls, adn display.  Great razor.  One thing though, the trimmer is not that great on this one.  Very nice razor and great shave.  Love it.  Have had it for about 2 monthes now.</li>
    <li> I had  Braun 7526 shaver and I thought it worked pretty good. When I thought I should upgrade I researched and decided to spend the big bucks on the 790cc. It does not shave my neck nearly as close and the trimmer is at a wierd angle and makes it hard to trim anything except sideburns. I see no advantage to the \\&quot;pulse\\&quot; action either. I should have stuck with the 7526 for much less money and a closer shave.</li>
    <li> I have always bought the top of the line Norelco and been very happy with them. My last one operated substantially slower than previous models and I was not as happy. I read about the Braun 9595 and though I would try this. WOW, this is the best have I have had in my 66 years. My wife thinks that it is too noisy, but I dpn&#x27;t complain about her beauty equipment noise so she says \\&quot;OK\\&quot; and endures the noise. I do not care about the noise. I absolutely love the shave. My first one finally wore out. I bout a new one Model 390CC and was very disappointed. It operates at a much lower speed and will not hold a candle to to 9595. I finally went looking and found more of the model 9595 and immediately ordered another one. YEAH ! I am thrilled. Best razor ever, and I have tried them all.</li>
    <li> Let me preface this review by saying I&#x27;ve never spent more than $50 on an electric razor in the past.  I hate shaving as my face is easily irritated by razors both standard and electric.  My Remington foil shaver&#x27;s battery started to fail to the point I had to leave it plugged in all the time.  It was over 5yrs old and it was time to start shopping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw this at my local Marshalls store for $199.  It looked good, but the price was very steep.  My wife suggested we play the waiting game to see if they would drop the price.  I did some research, mostly here on Amazon, and picked it up last night.  Thankfully, it was still there (not marked down).  Anyway, I brought it home set it up and let it charge.  A few hours later before my shower I shaved for the first time.  This was the WOW moment.  It was the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had with an electric shaver plus NO IRRITATION!!!!  It had been a few days since I last shaved and I looked a bit nasty (my wife&#x27;s words).  So, I would say I put it to a good test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After shaving I returned the razor to the base and it suggested an ECO clean.  For those that have commented on the noise it makes during the cleaning cycle I would say what do you expect.  The razor cycles on and off in order to clean the head.  The sound was muffled inside the base so it was not as loud as shaving.  All in all I would not worry about the noise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review if my opinion changes after further use.  So far it seems you get what you pay for when it comes to electric razors.</li>
    <li> My husband has used this shaver for a couple of years and really loves it. This is an excellent looking shaver and I like the fact the base is white rather than silver so it&#x27;s easier to clean. I am so over shiny metallic surfaces that mark easily. I think it complements the silver shaver. It doesn&#x27;t look disco or flash it&#x27;s just an exceptionally smart looking shaver with an outstanding build quality which you&#x27;d expect for this premium price.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver gives an excellent shave. Not as close as wet shaving but I&#x27;ve yet to find a shaver that does. As far as electric shavers go it&#x27;s the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had. I&#x27;ve thrown my old Philips coolskin away on receipt of this. The extendable trimmer is also easy to use accurately.&lt;br /&gt;I did have one of these Braun clean and renew systems several years ago and this seems an improvement. The base while large isn&#x27;t as wide and squat as it&#x27;s predecessors. The cleaning cartidges are an ongoing expense but not outrageously expensive. There is a huge eww factor on changing the used cartrides though. They do end up murky and horrible after a months use.&lt;br /&gt;It is impractical to take the shaver away from home because of the sloshy, large, fluid filled base unit but you can rinse the shaver under water as you can do with conventional shavers.&lt;br /&gt;This shaver has no problem with thick, coarse hair and doesn&#x27;t tug or leave any shaving rash.&lt;br /&gt;The base station has loud cleaning stages which are as noisy as a washing machine spin cycle but they only lasts a short while. The rest of the cleaning cycle is quiet. It could wake up the rest of the house in the mornings though. Each cartridge lasts for about 30 cleaning cycles.&lt;br /&gt;It does look a bit like a James Bond gadget shaver. There is even a LCD display on the end of the handle showing you battery and hygiene levels.&lt;br /&gt;A one hour charge on the base unit gives you 50 minutes shaving time or you can use it plugged into a shaver socket with the cable provided.&lt;br /&gt;The expense is a downside but I would say it&#x27;s worth it.ould say it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> OK- this looks like a lot of hype, but it is GREAT! Close shave! Spendy, and worth it! It&#x27;s faster, easier i.e. less steps involved,  and better than shaving with a razor. My wife LOVES it... and she is PICKY about how well I shave.</li>
    <li> My husband loves his new Braun. It was a great investment. He never complains about razor stubble or sensitivity to the razor anymore. I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> Here is a breakdown of my evaluation of the Braun Pulsonic System 9595CC with LCD Screen:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Pros **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt; Construction&lt;br /&gt;The constuction of this shaver is superb. The body of the shaver is made from plastic but it has a very refined metallic look. The LCD screen seems to be made of glass and looks to be fairly scratch resistant. The shaver itself is made in Germany and has the look and feel of quality construction. The shaver is fairly weighty (but not too heavy) which adds to the overall impression of a solid build.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt; Function/Performance&lt;br /&gt;The shave is just about as close as that from a shaving blade. Maybe there is something to this \\&quot;Pulsonic\\&quot; technology after all (10,000 Micro-Vibrations per minute) which is supposed to help lift hair to provide a closer cut. I was unable to see or feel any stuble after a shave. The shaved area actually feels silky smooth! Thanks to the new and improved screen foil and cutterblock for the Pulsonic 9595CC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pulsonic has a flexing/pivoting head to help the shaver conform to the contour of your face. I personally don&#x27;t really care very much for it as I&#x27;m accustomed to flexing my wrist to angle the shaver to my face. The pivoting head can also be locked in place to tackle the hard to reach area under the nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pop-up trimmer is very functional and does as good a job as a dedicated trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt; Features&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning Convenience: The Clean &amp; Renew system automatically cleans, lubricates, and dries the saver at the touch of a button. It also has a 25-second quick cleaning cycle for when you have to use your shaver in a hurry (This feature is only available on the Braun Pulsonic System 9595CC with LCD Screen, not on the lesser equipped Braun Pulsonic System 9585CC with LED Lights). After each cleaning, the shaver smells clean and lemony.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver can be washed under tap water but with this method of cleaning, the manual states that the shaver head needs to be lubed with a few drops of lubricant every week or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver sports an LCD screen which has a \\&quot;hygiene\\&quot; and a \\&quot;battery\\&quot; indicator each of which has six graduations/levels arranged in a semi-circular fashion and occupies half of the screen. The hygiene indicator shows when the shaver needs to be cleaned. The battery indicator, of course, indicates how much power is left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No time to wait around for the shaver to recharge? No problem. The power cord can be hooked up directly to the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt; Warranty&lt;br /&gt;The shaver has a 2-year warranty (excludes the Cutter and Foil part - you&#x27;re advised to replace this every 18 months).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt; Ergonomics&lt;br /&gt;The back and sides of the shaver are rubberized to help you to maintain a firm and comfortable grip while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt; Aesthetics&lt;br /&gt;The Braun Pulsonic System 9595CC exudes elegance, class and sophistication with its sleek lines and its beautifully crafted elements that convey a work of intricate and robust engineering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Cons **&lt;br /&gt;I have only one. Here it is for completeness sake:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt; Price&lt;br /&gt;The real gripe I have about this shaver is not so much its price because it&#x27;s a one-time expense but the price of the Clean &amp; Renew cartridges. Talk about \\&quot;giving away razors to sell razor blades\\&quot; except in this case the razor is, patently, not free. Braun advises that the cartridge be replaced after 30 cleaning cycles or 6-8 weeks WCF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Additional Points **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt; Economic Considerations&lt;br /&gt;Some economically-conscious people have suggested using isopropyl alcohol mixed with a lubricant to refill the cartridge. The factory cleaning fluid actually contains a highly volatile alcohol and a lubricant component, which is apparent after each cleaning because the residual lubricant can be felt if you run your finger through the sides of the shaver head. They further suggest removing the cartridge and capping it after each cleaning to prevent the loss of the highly volatile fluid. That&#x27;s too much of a hassle and I don&#x27;t see it as a necessity because once the cartridge is in place, the openings of the cartridge form a watertight seal with the cleaning component and the loss of the solution through evaporation is very minimal. At least one individual suggested changing the cartridge every 6-months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Conclusion **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun Pulsonic System 9595CC with LCD is pricey but it is worth every penny. Don&#x27;t let the price of the Clean &amp; Renew cartridges deter you from getting this little gem because you can always forego the automated cleaning option and simply use running tap water. I personally have no regrets about getting this shaver and I highly recommend it. Go on, get it and see for yourself how the Braun Pulsonic System 9595CC with LCD lives up to its hype.dge is in place, the openings of the cartridge form a watertight seal with the cleaning component and the loss of the solution through evaporation is very minimal.

    <li> I just upgraded from the 8995 to the 9595 and in a word it&#x27;s fabulous! I converted from Norelco rotary razors about a year ago to Braun and at the time I was very impressed with the build quality and how close the shave was compared to the Norelco. For the record I had the top of the line Norelco 9190XL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Braun redesigned their flagship razor they started with a clean slate. This isn&#x27;t a simple upgrade of the 8995, it goes beyond that. They reduced the size of the overall unit making it slimmer and more comfortable to hold. The head now has a greater range of pivoting and the cutters now float individually. Overall it allows the shaver to more closely follow the contours of your face while maintaining contact with the skin it is trying to shave. Also this model doesn&#x27;t seem to drop or shed the cut stubble all over the counter top as easily as the old model. The way the new screen and blades are designed they seem to trap and hold the cut hair in the head until it&#x27;s time to be cleaned. The old model would dust my counter top with cut stubble as if I were using a pepper shaker on my counter top. Two thumbs up for the new head design. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new Pulsonic motor is in my opinion much quieter than the model it replaces. The sonic pulses are supposed to vibrate the head causing the screen to catch more hair with less passes over the same spot. The result is truly outstanding! I have a patch of hair just over my adams apple that I have to really spend a lot of time trying to shave by stretching the skin . The new razor nearly eliminates all the work and makes shaving more comfortable and FASTER than ever before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The LCD display is smaller than the outgoing model but it displays the same amount of information. It tells me the remaining charge and the current hygiene state of the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Clean &amp; Renew base station has also been redesigned. It is now an off white color and matches my tile counter top. Also the start button has been redesigned and it no longer locks the razor in place while it&#x27;s cleaning. The instructions state that the Clean &amp; Renew station will \\&quot;dry \\&quot; the razor using heat. I&#x27;m not sure if the old model did this or not but it is a welcome feature nonetheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this razor to anyone looking to buy an electric razor. It&#x27;s quiet, fast and close shaves are as good as you&#x27;re going to get. The build quality is top notch and the company stands behind their products.

    <li> +  Haven&#x27;t used an electric razor in a long time, my work requires shaving everyday so thought I&#x27;d try it out, very handy, quick minute a day and I&#x27;m good to go.  Gives a good close shave (for an electric), no skin irritation, no skin pinches.  Price wasn&#x27;t too too bad, it&#x27;s a top of the line so getting with ya pay for, it was worth it for me.    -  the cleaning solution I hear can be pricey, the hygiene meter is a bit sensitive, after a few shaves it says to clean it, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s necessary.  I usually just wipe it out with the brush (included) and do a full cleaning after a while.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000IWFU3W Braun 790CC Series 7 Men&#x27;s Cordless Shaver]]  I was using razors on a daily basis - the expensive Gillete razors with the 3 blades.  Anyway, I gave this electric a shot (never having liked any electric before) was was extremely surprised!!  It performed great, the self-cleaning is a breeze and cleans the head perfectly, the led indicator is informative, and it is alwsys charged in the base.  Great feature for travelers is that you don&#x27;t need the base to charge as it can be plugged into wall withour base and comes with a hard plastic carrying case.  This product is expensive but very high quality.</li>
    <li> Have read about this shaver for a long time and did my research. Have been very happy with the product and although it was expensive I feel it was worth it.</li>
    <li> This is the fourth bruan, and the second series 7 shaver I have owned.  I have had other electric shavers, but none can come close the shave of this razor.</li>
    <li> Husband loves the razor and it&#x27;s components. Packaged well, arrived on time, probably worth the money if the power stays on. Hubby says it shaves closely and does the job.</li>
    <li> May 2009.  I purchased the Braun 9595 shaver because of its favorable reviews.  I have had the shaver now for over one year, having purchased it in May 2008.  Previously, I have always had Philips/Norelco razors for over 55 years.  As my last Philips/Norelco razor was dying, I decided to change to Braun (at age 12, my first razor was a Braun, a gift from my uncle).   I am sorry that I did not return the Braun 9595 before the one month trial was over.  Filled with hope, I kept on using the razor.  After the first month, I was stuck with it as it cost me $300 CAD.  The razor has problems.  First, it is not a dry razor but a wet one.  The only way I can get it to work is to oil the two prongs on the inside of the razor and to put one drop of oil on each of the three blades on the outside of the comb.  I use Wahl Clipper Oil as that provided with the razor causes the razor to seize up.  I often put alcohol-based hand-sanitizer on the blades to spread out the oil.  Then, I rinse my face with water and begin shaving until the sound of the razor changes.  Next, I put the head of the razor, still running, under lukewarm water and continue shaving.  Then, I take a shower to wash off the Wahl oil.  This way, I can shave with the Braun 9595.  The Braun cleaning solution does not help much to lubricate the razor.  I live in a near desert with the relative humidity of approximately 30% (less in winter) in Calgary Alberta, Canada.  I clean the razor after use in the morning.  The razor is almost completely dry when I begin to use it the following morning. Without the work-arounds, the razor stops working after a minute or so. Second, the razor is so loud that it wakes up my family when I am shaving in the morning.  Not pleasant.  Thirdly, the info from Braun that I read said that it takes 3 minutes to shave.  Wrong.  Shaving time is approximately 10 minutes.   Fourth, the Razor sometimes does not shave long hairs of 3 to 5 mm under my nose or on my face.  Fifth, the razor says that I must replace the 9595 comb after 18 months.  In the 11th month, this replacement message began flashing. Sixth, don&#x27;t forget the special cassettes filled with cleaning solution.  They cost $20 CAD at our local Wal-Mart for 2.  These need to be replaced at 3 to 4 week intervals.  In sum, buy a Philips/Norelco electric razor.  Quieter and drier.  Alternately, go to Costco and purchase 52 disposable razors.  Cheaper.</li>
    <li> This still has to be the best of the Braun range; it cuts closer than a wet-shave without the blood! great battery life and the carrying case is a must for me.  I tend not to leave mine on constant charge as I beleive this will shorten the charge life - I ususally get 2 - 3 weeks from one charge - but that depends how \\&quot;Desperate Dan\\&quot; I let my bristles grow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Best I have owned/tried - Dont go cheap as the little extra buys you so much more in this range.</li>
    <li> Best electric shaver ever. The only drawback is the cleaning fluid which does not last very long and is not cheap.</li>
    <li> I recently bought this shaver to replace my previous Braun which I wore out.  I clean my shaver after every use.  It costs about $5 per month for the cleaning solution.  This shaver has lots of power and has cut my shaving time by more than half.  Expensive but worth it.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent razor.  I&#x27;ve tried many different brands and models and this is quite simply the best.</li>
    <li> Braun has really outdone themselves with this new series of razors. I have owned many of the Braun series razors none of which shaves as close as this new design.The 790CC is very quite for this type of razor which my wife loves, she hates being woke up early in the morning.                                   The price is a bit to much but worth it. If you can justify spending $200+ then go for it you will not be disappointed.Oh yea, I spend less time shaving because you do not need to go over each stroke to get a close shave.Way to go Braun.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Series 7 790CC from J&amp;R in NY on March 12th and so far this product is a hit and miss.  I decided to spend a little extra on an electric shaver since my barber uses a Braun Syncro  7505 and it gets most of the hair.  So I thought well the most expensive must be the best well wrong.  I have to pass the shaver through the same area aleast 6 or 7 times to get any hair removed and at the end I still see stuble on my face.  I feel like I wasted money on a product that doesn&#x27;t do what advertised.  The less expensive models do more than what this one does , I will stick to using razor blades which do the job.  My advice is dont purchase this product if you want a good finish its not going to do the job its just a waste of money.</li>
