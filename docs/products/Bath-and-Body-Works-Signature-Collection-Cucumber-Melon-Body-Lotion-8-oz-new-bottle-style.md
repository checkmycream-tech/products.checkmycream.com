    <li> My friend was upset when this scent was discontinued- it&#x27;s always your favorite that they get rid of, right? I am going to give this to her as a Christmas gift this year. She&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> This was part of a birthday gift. Although I could have just gone to the store to get it, it was so much more convenient to buy it online. Arrived promptly. I use these products all the time and love them.</li>
    <li> Great fragrance. Ruth</li>
    <li> My wife likes these products from Bath and Body works. It beats going 20 miles or so to the locall store.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a number of years. The fragrance is subtle and pleasant so when Bath &amp; Body Works no longer carried this product, I looked around to see where I could buy it. The fact that if I buy 4 bottles, there are no shipping charges is a plus,too, since it still is cheaper than if I purchased it in the store at the local mall. I will continue to purchse this from the online seller.</li>
    <li> Item half full top was not screwed on tightly, I only received half full bottle</li>
    <li> Put in my wife&#x27;s stocking for Christmas.  She has always liked BBW moisturizers, and this one is no exception.  She really loves the scent, and I&#x27;ve got to admit it smells nice on her.</li>
    <li> This is the body lotion I use and cannot buy in store and also if I did it would cost more.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for all you do for us who shop at home.&lt;br /&gt;Thelma Shaffer&lt;br /&gt;Deer Park, Texas</li>
    <li> Received quickly and with no problem. Has a great clean scent without being too strong of a smell.  My go to body lotion.</li>

    <li> I love this product. Smells wonderful. Although it is discontinued in the stores, I am glad I can get it from Amazon. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I forgot the wonderful aroma of this lotion. I have severe allergies and cannot smell most things. I can smell this. The smell makes me feel so alive. It is soothing, not overpowering. If you have not tried this Cucumber Melon Lotion, try. It now. You will not regret your purchase!</li>
    <li> My mom loved it. She has been looking for it in stores for over a year, but the stores&lt;br /&gt;had &amp;#34;retired&amp;#34; this fragrance.</li>
    <li> A very nice lightly scented lotion.  I like the new bottle vs the old squeeze tube, which tended to leak.</li>
    <li> my daughter loves the scent</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister for Christmas and she loves this one!</li>
    <li> B&amp;B Works no longer carries this scent in its stores, which is beyond me as it has been a very popular scent.  The product smelled fresh (a blended combo of the 2 scents without one overpowering the other) when rec&#x27;d, was a full sized 8oz bottle &amp; came in a wire storage &amp;#34;basket&amp;#34; with a full 10 oz. size shower gel.  Couldn&#x27;t find this scent anywhere until I stumbled upon &#x27;Triple M Fashion Five&#x27; - I was panicked - it was days from Christmas, I was ill, so I sent an e-mail asking if they thought I could get these products before Christmas.  Rec&#x27;d a mail back promptly saying if I acted quick, they would ship same day if possbile.  They made good on their word - rec&#x27;d the set in 2 days, just days before Christmas no less.  The vendor is in CA as well as I, but still....  Those of us who have tried B&amp;B Works products know they are good, but to find a vendor that comes through for the customer in a pinch is....priceless.  Please support this vendor, they seem to be a sincere company &amp; sent me a couple of samples along with my order &amp; a lovely note of thank you for doing business with them.</li>
    <li> Love this scent and every one at work wants to know what that beautiful smell is! Wish they hadn&#x27;t discontinued it :(</li>

    <li> Nice smelling lotion. I purchased as a gift for my mother in-law. My only issue is that one was wrapped completely in the protective wrapper and the other lotion had this wrapper removed. No big deal to me because I could see it was new. Next time I may just get it directly from Bath &amp; Body Works.</li>
    <li> tis product is cheaper on line here than in stores and arrived so quickly and fast so i could not be happier</li>
    <li> Bought this as part of my wife&#x27;s birthday present. She really likes the Cucumber Melon because it does not have a really strong overpowering smell. Guys, you really can&#x27;t go wrong with Bath &amp; Body Works stuff as long as you know her favorite scents. ;-)</li>
    <li> Smelled funny. Had to return.</li>
