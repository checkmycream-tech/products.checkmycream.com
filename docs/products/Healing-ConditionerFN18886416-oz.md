      <li>It&#x27;s a fantastic leave in conditioner</li>
      <li>My hairdresser originally recommended it to me</li>
      <li>It provides even extra conditioning if you wrap your hair with a warm towel and let it set for about 15 mins or more before washing off.  </li>
      <li>Hair smooth , silky , highly recommend !!!</li>
      <li>Have been using this conditioner for many years and really like the product.  </li>
      <li>Feeling better today, I decided to take a long hot one } and dared to wash my hair , I read reviews on how great this was, and I really wanted to use it right away..</li>
      <li>and I find that it leaves my white hair very manageable and bright in color.  </li>
      <li>It was worth the wait..</li>
      <li>After lightening, I applied the Healing Conditioner and out of all my years of doing hair, this is by far one of my top 3 conditioners.  </li>
      <li>The moisture and shine and it by far just made my color and hair feel and look that much better.</li>
      <li>It is just the right combo for my hair type.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s mild and gentle and doesn&#x27;t contain any sulfites that can damage your hair.  </li>

      <li>Worth the extra money for silky, smooth hair.</li>
      <li>Love this product for my very long, straight hair.  </li>
      <li>One of the best conditioners I have tried, and I have thick dry hair.  </li>
      <li>I have used the whole tub now</li>
      <li>Amazon had it much cheaper than my hairdresser</li>
      <li>Works very well</li>
      <li>It smells just like Aquage products should; so I do think it&#x27;s the real thing.</li>
      <li>Expected more from it.  </li>
      <li>I find that it perfectly hydrates my dry, course hair without making it greasy or weighed down at all like so many other deep conditioners, so you can use it every day.  </li>
      <li>It looks like nothing special , just a white cream style conditioner , the feel is silky to the touch..</li>
      <li>One of those CLW (can&#x27;t live without) items!  </li>
      <li>After reading some reviews I was excited to use this product for my dry unmanageable hair.</li>
      <li>I have super curly hair and it can not live without this conditioner.</li>
      <li>My hair is so soft and manageable with this conditioner that I don&#x27;t think I could live with out it.  </li>
      <li>i have very often had my hair colored, but recently started using this &amp; VOILA</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s early morning</li>
      <li>Started using this stuff 6 years ago and it is by far and away</li>
      <li>(it went fast) and my hair looks and feels about the same.</li>
      <li>and I wish it had more negative reviews that would have dissuaded me from buying it.  </li>
      <li>One word of caution, the lid edges can be sharp so be sure to loosen the lid before you have wet hands!</li>
      <li>, I had super soft hair , you could see it wet..and even as it dried it looked the same...</li>
      <li>and it really does seem to be getting a little healthier.  </li>

<li> , I had super soft hair , you could see it wet..and even as it dried it looked the same...</li>

<li> so this is going to last me a long time.</li>
<li> I highly recommend this conditioner if your hair is a little stressed or dry.  </li>
<li> Left hair dry.</li>
<li> I have used really expensive shampoos and conditioners , that gave you that silky look when wet , but as it dries it would take on a more frizzed look , even now</li>
<li> I have very curly, color treated, long, thick hair</li>
<li> My hairdresser only carries a couple of things from the line, so I like to experiment with other things.  </li>
<li> My hair is now so dry that it feels like straw.</li>
<li> My roots tend to be oily with my ends dry and prone to breakage from being over processed.</li>
<li> when your hair gets dry it gives it moisture.</li>
<li> and I could not live with it.</li>
<li> I have also noticed some shine coming back, and a lot less snapping off of my ends...</li>
<li> I have very dry and damaged hair...</li>
<li> If you know anything about lightening and bleaching you know the hair is very dry afterwards.</li>
<li> It not only dried faster</li>
<li> It usually takes several hours  to dry.</li>
<li> Mixed a little of this with the curling cream to soften and condition my hair from about neck down (did not use on my scalp).  </li>
<li> It came a few days late (all mail seems to be slow these days), but is worth the wait.  </li>
<li> Definitely recommend product and hard to beat the price I paid online.</li>
<li> My hair is thick and half down my back...</li>
<li> This provides shine without weighing down my hair.  </li>

    <li> The best conditioner ever made. I have super curly hair and it can not live without this conditioner. I use it after the Aquage Color Care shampoo (not because I color my hair but because it&#x27;s the best shampoo ever) and I combine this conditioner with Aquage&#x27;s Biomega Intensive Conditioner. It is just the right combo for my hair type. My hair loves it, and I will not go without it! :)</li>
    <li> This provides shine without weighing down my hair.  I love my hair when I use this product.</li>
    <li> Great repair conditioner for damaged and healthy hair too.</li>
    <li> i have very often had my hair colored, but recently started using this &amp; VOILA it looks Fantastic! &amp; feels Great!  Love Everything Aquage &amp; I used to be a Redken devotee :}</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner, and it smells so good!!</li>
    <li> This conditioner is the best - I treat my curls right - and this is the top of the line.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Love this product for my very long, straight hair.  Mixed a little of this with the curling cream to soften and condition my hair from about neck down (did not use on my scalp).  Works very well and I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Good for keeping split ends under control.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this product for many years and it&#x27;s, by far, the best conditioner ever!  Buying online is the way to go. (for this product)</li>
    <li> One of the best conditioners I have tried, and I have thick dry hair.  I&#x27;m still using this and I&#x27;ve had the container for months now.  Worth the extra money for silky, smooth hair. The smell is heavenly as well.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this conditioner.  I find that it perfectly hydrates my dry, course hair without making it greasy or weighed down at all like so many other deep conditioners, so you can use it every day.  My hair is so soft and manageable with this conditioner that I don&#x27;t think I could live with out it.  My hairdresser originally recommended it to me and since then I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything that works better.  The only downside is that it&#x27;s very hard to find (my salon is often out of it and most salons don&#x27;t carry it).  I also like the Aquage silkening shampoo.  It&#x27;s mild and gentle and doesn&#x27;t contain any sulfites that can damage your hair.  Using these two products has dramatically improved the texture and reduced breakage and split ends.  A wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Aquage is a great product!  However, Aquage needs to supply bigger bottles of conditioner to match their larger shampoo products.</li>
    <li> Used it before, works great !!</li>
    <li> After fighting and losing to a cold ,{ and having long hair,well it gets dirty after a few days } and not wanting to move , let alone take a shower..Feeling better today, I decided to take a long hot one } and dared to wash my hair , I read reviews on how great this was, and I really wanted to use it right away..It was worth the wait..It looks like nothing special , just a white cream style conditioner , the feel is silky to the touch..BUT the second it hit my hair , I felt the difference...I left it on for about 45-60 seconds..It said to use a comb to it through , I forgot my comb { usually hanging in shower, but I bleached them in water } and forgot to grab..My hair is thick and half down my back...It usually takes several hours  to dry.{ 2-4 } not with this , even after I wring out my hair , it usually continues to drip a little bit ..It not only dried faster , I had super soft hair , you could see it wet..and even as it dried it looked the same...I have used really expensive shampoos and conditioners , that gave you that silky look when wet , but as it dries it would take on a more frizzed look , even now and it&#x27;s early morning it looks amazing...I would say Yes, Yes , to this product..This goes to the top of my list...Very much impressed...~!~</li>
    <li> I have medium length hair that is fine but there is a lot of it. My roots tend to be oily with my ends dry and prone to breakage from being over processed. I was hoping this would heal my hair like the it says or at least make it softer. I have used the whole tub now (it went fast) and my hair looks and feels about the same. The smell is nice though. It smells just like Aquage products should; so I do think it&#x27;s the real thing. Maybe it needed to be left it in my hair for longer than 10 minutes to work... I probably won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t leave reviews, but I trusted the reviews on this one and I wish it had more negative reviews that would have dissuaded me from buying it.  Left hair dry. Did not feel designer at all.  Expected more from it.  Don&#x27;t like to waste, but didn&#x27;t even finish using it.</li>
    <li> Started using this stuff 6 years ago and it is by far and away the  best I&#x27;ve ever used. Pair this with the Detailing cream applied to towel dried hair. Style and stay beautiful until next washing.</li>
    <li> Any of the products that I have ordered online have been expired. This is awful. Go to a salon.. by the time you pay for shipping, you&#x27;re paying the same and getting a better product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hair stylist and I recently lightened my hair.  After lightening, I applied the Healing Conditioner and out of all my years of doing hair, this is by far one of my top 3 conditioners.  It instantly softened my hair and just brought it back to life.  If you know anything about lightening and bleaching you know the hair is very dry afterwards. It instantly brought it back to life.  The moisture and shine and it by far just made my color and hair feel and look that much better.</li>
    <li> I ordered this conditioner because my hairdresser had used it on my hair for deep conditioning and it felt wonderful.  Amazon had it much cheaper than my hairdresser so I ordered from here.  It came a few days late (all mail seems to be slow these days), but is worth the wait.  I highly recommend this conditioner if your hair is a little stressed or dry.  It provides even extra conditioning if you wrap your hair with a warm towel and let it set for about 15 mins or more before washing off.  Definitely recommend product and hard to beat the price I paid online.</li>
    <li> The Aquage healing conditioner delivers all it promises and more. It&#x27;s a fantastic leave in conditioner and I could not live with it.</li>
    <li> I have very dry and damaged hair...I bought this and it really does seem to be getting a little healthier.  I have also noticed some shine coming back, and a lot less snapping off of my ends...I would recommend giving it a try</li>
    <li> I get this for my wife every year&lt;br /&gt;She loves it and can not find it in our local area</li>
    <li> After reading some reviews I was excited to use this product for my dry unmanageable hair. I am so very disappointed  now that I have used it. This product is the absolute worst conditioner that I have ever used on my hair. My hair is now so dry that it feels like straw. Paying $30.00+ for something like this makes me angry.</li>
    <li> Great product , absolutely love it . Hair smooth , silky , highly recommend !!! Using it in pair with Aquage Smoothing Shampoo .</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not only for hair if you have a rash any where it helps to control it. Good for the winter when your hair gets dry it gives it moisture.</li>
    <li> Have been using this conditioner for many years and really like the product.  I also use the Aquage shampoo.  This size conditioner last me about 6 months and I find that it leaves my white hair very manageable and bright in color.  I have no problem with yellowing.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Does wonders for my hair.  Leaves it smooth adn shiney.  Sometimes I combine it with my Bed Head Recovery.</li>
    <li> I have very curly, color treated, long, thick hair and it only took a drop of this conditioner to soften all of my hair! Best of all- I only need to use it as a deep conditioner once a week so this is going to last me a long time. Well worth the money- incredible results.</li>
    <li> One of those CLW (can&#x27;t live without) items!  Simply, the BEST conditioner I have ever used!!!  Contains &amp;#34;sea botanicals&amp;#34; and silk amino acids both of which are magic for managing the texture (frizzes / split ends) of chemically colored hair.  One word of caution, the lid edges can be sharp so be sure to loosen the lid before you have wet hands!</li>
    <li> Stuff works great - After shampooing makes my hair smooth - comb goes through hair easier - also stays in place while drying.  Ed  Renton, WA</li>
    <li> Very pleased with results</li>
    <li> I love the way this conditioner leaves my color treated hair feeling and looking.  Haven&#x27;t found anything that works as well.</li>
    <li> This came with no problems very quickly! I love, love, love the aquage line and have not found it at any beauty outlet stores.  My hairdresser only carries a couple of things from the line, so I like to experiment with other things.  I simply love the smell! It also works great on the hair!</li>
