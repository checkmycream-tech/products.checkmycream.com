      <li>They are comfortable and not to mention they look great on.</li>
      <li>These are nice.</li>
      <li>nice shine...</li>
      <li>They show nice in the hand, but the magnets could be stronger (or I just have overly fat/thick ear lobes).</li>
      <li>They do look nice but they won&#x27;t stay on.</li>
      <li>WORTH THE BUY!!!</li>
      <li>I good and strong</li>
      <li>I love them</li>
      <li>Yes ,  I  will get some more.</li>
      <li>These are okay but do to the lack of magnetic strength.</li>
      <li>what more can you ask you get what you pay for</li>
      <li>Look better in person than in the picture.</li>
      <li>Came home fast,  great fit</li>
      <li>very cool.</li>
      <li>The magnet is very strong which I think is awesome because if I wanted to wear them everyday it would not be a problem.</li>
      <li>The Magnets are soo strong they hurt my ear</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the cheap price, stylish, and the magnet is strong.</li>
      <li>but overall I&#x27;m happy with them.</li>
      <li>Looks good only problem is magnet not to strong have to use both magnets for one earring</li>
      <li>I would&#x27;ve liked the better in bigger size.</li>
      <li>Great Quality Just Don&#x27;t Loose Them.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a cool ear ring but one was already messed up.</li>
      <li>They have a pretty strong magnet.</li>
      <li>Lost the magnet/backing on that one, luckily there is another.</li>
      <li>Nice sparkle but a bit too big.</li>
      <li>Totally worth the price mane</li>
      <li>They would be better if there were multiple magnets!</li>
      <li>The magnet don&#x27;t hold pretty well, but for the price</li>
      <li>but i lost one in the first day  when i got it</li>
      <li>I got this the first day and it was not what I wanted it would hand of your ear and</li>
      <li>:) buying a second pair.</li>
      <li>Earrings broke on first day.</li>
      <li>Strong enough magnet.</li>
      <li>Hard to fit to ear and not always very secure</li>
      <li>Just what I needed, looks like the real thing</li>
      <li>this is the closes hes getting to real pierced earrings, giggle....</li>
      <li>I found a bigger on in my tool box that worked better and was about three times the size as the tiny one that was included.</li>
      <li>These are very nice, the only thing is if the magnet falls it&#x27;s going to to be hard to find.</li>
      <li>The backing magnet wasn&#x27;t strong enough to hold the earring to my adult male ear.</li>
      <li>I wish the magnet was bigger and a little bit stronger but other than that the product is pretty good</li>
      <li>Weak back magnets but replaced the back magnets and work great</li>
      <li>/&gt;They are not for long term wear as they do leave pressure marks after a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;The magnets are strong but can fall off with much movement.&lt;br</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s fine though, I used the magnet for that one and attached it to the other magnet so that the other one won&#x27;t fall off.</li>

    <li> Would be great if magnet had more strength</li>
    <li> Theses were very good looking but the magnets fell out when I was walking home</li>
    <li> Arrivied earlier than expected. Strong enough magnet. Look very nice.</li>
    <li> These are okay but do to the lack of magnetic strength. They would be better if there were multiple magnets!</li>

    <li> My son Loves this product. this is the closes hes getting to real pierced earrings, giggle....</li>
    <li> I cant seem to get the magnets to work properly. I think that is an user issue (me). The earrings are beautiful.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a cool ear ring but one was already messed up. The magnet on the earring was already off when it arrived. Just couldnt deal with the stress of returning it, so I had to deal with it</li>
    <li> I so like this earrings.  Yes ,  I  will get some more. So like them.</li>
    <li> Totally worth the price mane</li>
    <li> Came home fast,  great fit</li>
    <li> I wish the magnet was bigger and a little bit stronger but other than that the product is pretty good hopefully it&#x27;ll last long.</li>
    <li> These are nice.They have a pretty strong magnet.They are nicer then the picture, but they hurt if you wear them for a long time. I got these for my friend and brothers wedding, I started out the day at 6:00 wearing them and by 8:00 that night my ears hurt and i had to take them off. I am actually a woman, but these worked for me. My ears have closed up and i did not want to poke the holes back through, so I got these.</li>
    <li> The magnet don&#x27;t hold pretty well, but for the price what more can you ask you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> still doesnt have it for like four weeks already</li>
    <li> Nice sparkle but a bit too big. Look for something a little more subtle.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed, looks like the real thing</li>
    <li> Weak back magnets but replaced the back magnets and work great</li>
    <li> Earrings broke on first day. A waste of money.</li>
    <li> Horrible. I wore them 3 times and at the 4th time I wore them they fell off my ear and broke. Very weak magnetic. Don&#x27;t buy it</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t shake my head with out them falling out.&lt;br /&gt;Needs a stronger magnet.</li>
    <li> Great  ..  nice shine... n I love them</li>
    <li> The quality of the earrings is very nice. They are comfortable and not to mention they look great on. The magnet is very strong which I think is awesome because if I wanted to wear them everyday it would not be a problem.</li>
    <li> Perfect size and everything!!! My brother lost them but I&#x27;m going go order more!</li>
    <li> The backing magnet wasn&#x27;t strong enough to hold the earring to my adult male ear. I found a bigger on in my tool box that worked better and was about three times the size as the tiny one that was included.</li>
    <li> The Magnets are soo strong they hurt my ear</li>
    <li> I like the earing but the magnet is weak the didnt even stay on my ear</li>
    <li> Just upset that I lost the back piece but it&#x27;s a good product if you don&#x27;t lost that part</li>
    <li> i like it very nice and it looks like the photo</li>
    <li> Should come with a extra set of magnets</li>
    <li> I got this the first day and it was not what I wanted it would hand of your ear and other things I don&#x27;t think anyone should get it</li>
    <li> The magnet is not powerful enough to keep the earrings on my ears. They do look nice but they won&#x27;t stay on. I had no problems with the supplier or the shipping or anything else my only problem is they won&#x27;t stand my ears.</li>
    <li> I like them but I feel there should be multiple small magnets for the back of the earrings. I got my package yesterday and I was going to take them off... then it fell into the carpet... couldn&#x27;t seem to find it at all.</li>
    <li> CZ sparkles nicely.&lt;br /&gt;They are not for long term wear as they do leave pressure marks after a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;The magnets are strong but can fall off with much movement.&lt;br /&gt;One of the studs fell off and broke from the magnet.</li>
    <li> Amazing!!! Definitely worth the cheap price, stylish, and the magnet is strong. The delivery came n way quicker than I expected :) buying a second pair.</li>
    <li> Hard to fit to ear and not always very secure</li>
    <li> Did the job. Fairly big.</li>
    <li> A great way to some bling to your ears that have never been pierced or were pierced but the hole grew closed.&lt;br /&gt;They look great and feel good.</li>
    <li> These are very nice, the only thing is if the magnet falls it&#x27;s going to to be hard to find.</li>
    <li> They show nice in the hand, but the magnets could be stronger (or I just have overly fat/thick ear lobes). Mine fell off after only minutes on my ear. Lost the magnet/backing on that one, luckily there is another. Will give that one, that is left, a shot. Not much $$ for the show, so can&#x27;t complain. Will find another use for it, if needed.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re bigger then i expected. I was going to use them as a second piercing look until I actually got them done, but they&#x27;re too big for that. I tried them on, until one of them fell off and went down the drain. that&#x27;s fine though, I used the magnet for that one and attached it to the other magnet so that the other one won&#x27;t fall off. Works well for a cartilage piercing look.</li>
    <li> Look better in person than in the picture.</li>
    <li> I like these.  They are a little big I would recommend the 5mm.  They hold well.</li>
    <li> Great Quality Just Don&#x27;t Loose Them.</li>
