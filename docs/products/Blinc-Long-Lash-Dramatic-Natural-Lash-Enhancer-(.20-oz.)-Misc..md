      <li>AMAZING..</li>
      <li>I have been using lash enhancers, since they started to become popular.</li>
      <li>Product arrived a day early and in perfect condition.</li>
      <li>Another customer, in their review, raved about this product and even placed on her eyebrows with great success.  </li>
      <li>This product was okay.</li>
      <li>I Love Blinc and</li>
      <li>I have used this for years, and love it.</li>
      <li>and she now has respectable eyelashes.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love with Blinc mascara, and I&#x27;m excited to try the rest of their products.</li>
      <li>This is easy to apply, stays put all day, and washes off easily.</li>
      <li>...goes on easily</li>
      <li>I jus love this product and how quickly it</li>
      <li>very pleased to have found this lash serum &amp; will continue to use it on a regular basis...</li>
      <li>It really DOES work!  </li>
      <li>they are really growing!  </li>
      <li>didnt like it at first because it is like a lotion, but I was using too much.  </li>
      <li>I use it twice a day and now have real eyelashes for the first time in my life.  </li>
      <li>and since I love other Blinc products, I tried this for 1/3 of the price.&lt;br /&gt;Great results, even for eyebrows and fast!</li>
      <li>the price is crazy awesome! :0</li>
      <li>It is more than I expected.</li>
      <li>Thank you so much for this product.</li>
      <li>I have ever so slightly sensitive skin, so I didn&#x27;t think much of the irritation at first.</li>
      <li>Product does not sting or smell funny, and dries totally clear.</li>
      <li>however this particular product I would not purchase again nor recommend.</li>
      <li>But, 6 weeks in and using it faithfully, I am not convinced enough to overlook the mild irritation.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m currently sitting here with neosporin on my lash line in hopes that it heals quickly, and without infection.</li>
      <li>Been using this faithfully morning and night, after washing my face, and so far, have not seen much results, if any.</li>
      <li>My lashes are super long again, (like with RevitaLash)</li>
      <li>As far as lash products go, it compared to some others I have tried.</li>
      <li>This stuff and similar products really work.  </li>
      <li>So far even with applying on my eyebrows, not convinced this works and again causes irritation to the applied areas.</li>
      <li>The product also causes a red line of irritation and some swelling so if you have sensitive eyes, don&#x27;t bother.  </li>
      <li>I did not use the product regularly due to the side effects, so there wasn&#x27;t much lash enhancement.</li>
      <li>It caused me major irritation, and open sores on my lash line.</li>
      <li>Have not tried applying makeup over, but product seems to dry completely, and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue that would affect makeup.</li>

<li> ...thank you Blinc Long Lash!!</li>
<li> I started to notice a difference in only a week and a half.</li>
<li> Be careful applying the product because it will sting if you get in your eyes.</li>
<li> its been  6 weeks (typical)  </li>
<li> Probably about 1.5 times previous eyelash length.</li>
<li> No more raccoon eyes, and no need to abuse my eyes with harsh or oily eye makeup remover.</li>
<li> I have been using this for a while on my brows &amp; lashes &amp; haven&#x27;t seen any difference, compared to another brand I used that worked like crazy - I will go back to that one</li>
<li> My very expensive Enormous Lash reached a plateau</li>
<li> , maybe I will try again, but I am now going to apply a thin line of Biotin to my lashes and try that.  </li>
<li> and I hate the way it makes my eyes almost going blind</li>
<li> but I hate that irritates my eyes !</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This product was okay. As far as lash products go, it compared to some others I have tried. It just seems a bit clumpy to me unless I use a spooly to apply the product.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product! It works great! It is more than I expected. Thank you so much for this product.</li>
    <li> It seems to work, but I only gave it 3 stars because its goopy and thicker than other eyelash serums that I have tried.</li>
    <li> I bought this from hautelook, and started using it every night. It caused me major irritation, and open sores on my lash line. I&#x27;m currently sitting here with neosporin on my lash line in hopes that it heals quickly, and without infection. I have ever so slightly sensitive skin, so I didn&#x27;t think much of the irritation at first. I would not recommend if you have ANY type of sensitivity.</li>
    <li> I have been using this mascara for over a year, and it&#x27;s the best ever. No more raccoon eyes, and no need to abuse my eyes with harsh or oily eye makeup remover. This is easy to apply, stays put all day, and washes off easily.</li>
    <li> I jus love this product and how quickly it works!!...I have been using it just 2 weeks and already see results in length and thickness in my lashes!!...goes on easily &amp; I love the fact that I can use it in the morning too under my make-up!! &amp; again before bed...very pleased to have found this lash serum &amp; will continue to use it on a regular basis...I finally have my long lashes &amp; do not have to wear mascara if I chose :-)...thank you Blinc Long Lash!!</li>
    <li> 7/15/2014- For some reason, after using it faithfully for about 2 months- it stopped working... It has been over six months since I last used it, maybe I will try again, but I am now going to apply a thin line of Biotin to my lashes and try that.  I will open a powder capsule, and add some hyaluronic serum to drink it in, and I will post my results!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didnt like it at first because it is like a lotion, but I was using too much.  Now I just use a very thin line, which is even better as it will last longer.  It really DOES work!  My lashes are super long again, (like with RevitaLash) and I even think Blinc is making my lashes thicker!! RevitaLash doesn&#x27;t do that!  I Love Blinc and the price is crazy awesome! :0</li>
    <li> I have used this for years, and love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with Blinc mascara, and I&#x27;m excited to try the rest of their products. Product arrived a day early and in perfect condition. Product does not sting or smell funny, and dries totally clear. Have not tried applying makeup over, but product seems to dry completely, and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue that would affect makeup. Will update in 2 to 4 weeks with any changes to the appearance of my lashes.</li>
    <li> I just got this product and I hate the way it makes my eyes almost going blind , I don&#x27;t know what the results will be but I hate that irritates my eyes !</li>
    <li> Every night for a couple weeks &amp; you&#x27;ll see the difference...stop using, you&#x27;ll see a difference again lol stick with it!</li>
    <li> I started to notice a difference in only a week and a half. I am now on week six and have amazing eyelashes. I love it!</li>
    <li> But, 6 weeks in and using it faithfully, I am not convinced enough to overlook the mild irritation.&lt;br /&gt;I honestly do not see much result.</li>
    <li> I am using this product on my eyebrows..AMAZING..its been  6 weeks (typical)  they are really growing!  Love Love this product!!  I am hooked!</li>
    <li> It appeared to be working but it made my eyelids swell.  I even stopped using and restared using hoping it was not this item.  No luck.  Back to Rapid Lash.</li>
    <li> Been using this faithfully morning and night, after washing my face, and so far, have not seen much results, if any. Be careful applying the product because it will sting if you get in your eyes. The product also causes a red line of irritation and some swelling so if you have sensitive eyes, don&#x27;t bother.  Not convinced this  product actually helps your lashes grow longer.  Another customer, in their review, raved about this product and even placed on her eyebrows with great success.  So far even with applying on my eyebrows, not convinced this works and again causes irritation to the applied areas. I like a great many of the Blinc products, however this particular product I would not purchase again nor recommend.</li>
    <li> This stuff and similar products really work.  I use it twice a day and now have real eyelashes for the first time in my life.  Gave some to my sister, who was similarly afflicted with short, stubby eyelashes and she now has respectable eyelashes.  Probably about 1.5 times previous eyelash length.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a while on my brows &amp; lashes &amp; haven&#x27;t seen any difference, compared to another brand I used that worked like crazy - I will go back to that one</li>
    <li> The serum made my skin itchy and it also flakes after it dries. I did not use the product regularly due to the side effects, so there wasn&#x27;t much lash enhancement.</li>
    <li> I have been using lash enhancers, since they started to become popular. My very expensive Enormous Lash reached a plateau and since I love other Blinc products, I tried this for 1/3 of the price.&lt;br /&gt;Great results, even for eyebrows and fast! I only wish the tube was a bit bigger.</li>
