### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The fragrance is wonderful, do cut the wick shorter than 1/4 in however or there will be somking.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s the best smell I&#x27;ve ever found.</li>
      <li>Using it for the Hurricane Candle Warmer Lantern and the scent is wonderful!</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m not liking the scent of this candle - it has kind of a &amp;#34;fuel&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>To me, it smelled like a man&#x27;s cologne, and a very strong one - like a &amp;#34;Hey ladies, look at me&amp;#34; type of cologne.</li>
      <li>It is a VERY strong candle though.</li>
      <li>and it still makes the apt smell refreshing when we come home.</li>
      <li>I bought 2 more.</li>
      <li>Based on the many favorable reviews, I was hoping this handsome candle would smell like a spalike, cosy cedar.</li>
      <li>Yeah it&#x27;s a bit more pricey than what I wanted to pay</li>
      <li>I love this brand.  </li>
      <li>I bought this candle for my son and it is his favorite scent.  </li>
      <li>this candle is a blend of cedar wood, bergamot and amber, all of which I love.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Archepelago is almost always a sure hit, but Stonehenge is the Elvis of candles.</li>
      <li>The scent Stonehenge is lovely.</li>
      <li>The color is perfect for a guy - or anyone actually.  </li>
      <li>Very clean and not overpowering (IMO).</li>
      <li>My first &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; scented candle ever, and I have to say it smells good.</li>
      <li>Ran accross them years ago and was very impressed with how the smell doesn&#x27;t fade away like so many other candles.  </li>
      <li>Great masculine scent without smelling like a cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this particular candle, and I have to believe the others in this line are just as wonderful</li>
      <li>The candles are of&lt;br /&gt;good quality, burn well, and even have a strong smell when not lit.</li>
      <li>The scent is so pleasant, we purchased several in order to burn them for most of the day.  </li>
      <li>If it came in a different color, I would be happy with it as well.  </li>
      <li>I originally gave him a stonehenge candle that my husband bought for me...</li>
      <li>old son asked for a \\&quot;nice, yet masculine\\&quot; candle to burn while he studies, hangs out, etc.</li>
      <li>It is too sweet to my olfactory sense.</li>
      <li>Great masculine scent in a classy container.  </li>
      <li>but this candle has lasted longer than previous brands and the scent is great.  </li>
      <li>My husband and I both love these candles, the scent is different - strong without being flowery.</li>
      <li>and when you go from room to room, the transition is amazing, they pair sooo well together, so I would recommend getting both at the same time.</li>
      <li>The candle smells wonderful, however I had to return it as the glass jar was broken.</li>
      <li>so fresh smelling.</li>
      <li>These are great candles that last a long time and have a strong scent (not overpowering).  </li>
      <li>Other than that, it was received without incident and in good condition.  </li>
      <li>The smell is incredible and lasts such a long time.  </li>
      <li>Just what I was expecting, Happy with this long lasting spicy , musky scented candle.</li>
      <li>There was a hint of baby powder smell the first time I lit it</li>
      <li>Slightly on the masculine side, which I enjoy because I don&#x27;t want my apt smelling like flowers and what not,</li>
      <li>At first I really didn&#x27;t like this candle.</li>
      <li>I ordered a large Stonehenge scented candle and they sent me a Havana.  </li>
      <li>gave it to a friend with a large house but haven&#x27;t heard his thoughts on it yet.</li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t really say much.</li>
      <li>Five stars - thanks Archipelago.</li>
      <li>It fits the decor in my home which is part Restoration Hardware/part Pottery Barn/part mixture of modern and antiques.  </li>
      <li>I new to the whole candle scent thing</li>
      <li>So in my search for a \\&quot;masculine\\&quot; candle I repeatedly saw this brand, and this scent in particular, recommended.  </li>
      <li>The (cheap smelling) amber is much stronger than any other component.</li>
      <li>It does have a pleasant smell, different and hard to describe.</li>
      <li>But after using it a few times, the initial smell has worn off and the candle smells absolutely amazing now.</li>
      <li>The candle is so strong, which I like, but it makes the old man cologne style scent hard to bear.&lt;br /&gt;Would not buy again.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it, especially if you are using it for a candle warmer.</li>
      <li>My advice:  Be wary of purchasing more than one candle at a time, especially if you are interested in ordering different fragrances.</li>
      <li>The product was nice, but the vendor sent me the wrong fragrance.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> 1 candle can fill a home!  Love it!</li>
    <li> These are great candles.</li>
    <li> Based on the many favorable reviews, I was hoping this handsome candle would smell like a spalike, cosy cedar. However, the dominant note in this is bergamot - a high pitched, \\&quot;bright\\&quot; bergamot that is too harsh for my taste. It&#x27;s the same bergamot they use in the Havana candle, which I had to give away because it induced headaches in me. I can take about 20 minutes of Stonehenge before it becomes overpowering and I have to put it out. I will use up the candle, but I will have to look elsewhere for the mellow, cigar box cedarwood that I&#x27;m after.</li>
    <li> The product was nice, but the vendor sent me the wrong fragrance.  I ordered a large Stonehenge scented candle and they sent me a Havana.  The shipping for the heavy product would have cost too much, so I just kept it.  Other than that, it was received without incident and in good condition.  My advice:  Be wary of purchasing more than one candle at a time, especially if you are interested in ordering different fragrances.</li>
    <li> These are great candles that last a long time and have a strong scent (not overpowering).  It&#x27;s a good staple scent.</li>
    <li> We are totally hooked on these Stonehenge candles.  The scent is so pleasant, we purchased several in order to burn them for most of the day.  Caution:  These are addictive!  You&#x27;ll never buy Yankee Candles once you try the Archipelago Candles.</li>
    <li> I worship this candle like a Pagan at Belltaine.&lt;br /&gt;Seriously.  This candle&#x27;s aroma is beyond primal.  Archepelago is almost always a sure hit, but Stonehenge is the Elvis of candles. The King.&lt;br /&gt;This is it - and you never have to leave the building!&lt;br /&gt;Heaven with a Wick!</li>
    <li> agreed. I am poor and I will spend all $20 for this candle. shameless. but it&#x27;s the best smell I&#x27;ve ever found.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not liking the scent of this candle - it has kind of a &amp;#34;fuel&amp;#34; undertone that&#x27;s hard to get past.&lt;br /&gt;Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought this candle for my son and it is his favorite scent.  I originally gave him a stonehenge candle that my husband bought for me...I was not keen on a black candle.  If it came in a different color, I would be happy with it as well.  It does have a pleasant smell, different and hard to describe.</li>
    <li> My husband and I both love these candles, the scent is different - strong without being flowery.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like the smell.  It was too perfumey.</li>
    <li> Ahhh, THIS is what I had been looking for in a candle!  Over time I&#x27;ve been to spas and nice homes, and always wondered what candles do they use that smell sooo good?!  This Christmas my 16 yr. old son asked for a \\&quot;nice, yet masculine\\&quot; candle to burn while he studies, hangs out, etc. in his room.  (And no, he isn&#x27;t trying to cover up another scent, just wanted to have the atmosphere.)  So in my search for a \\&quot;masculine\\&quot; candle I repeatedly saw this brand, and this scent in particular, recommended.  I decided to take a chance and order one for him, and another for my husband (who likes to meditate and sometimes burns a candle) and I am very pleased!  The jar itself is solid, with a stable base and tight fitting lid.  The candle is so fragrant but not overpoweringly so.  The color is perfect for a guy - or anyone actually.  It fits the decor in my home which is part Restoration Hardware/part Pottery Barn/part mixture of modern and antiques.  I highly recommend this particular candle, and I have to believe the others in this line are just as wonderful so my next purchase will be for my daughter and my mother.  Five stars - thanks Archipelago.</li>
    <li> Entire family loves the scent of this candle... so fresh smelling. Only 4-stars because it&#x27;s a little too pricey to continue purchasing on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> My first &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; scented candle ever, and I have to say it smells good. I new to the whole candle scent thing so I can&#x27;t really say much.</li>
    <li> Although amber is listed as part of the fragrance, I assumed this candle would be mostly dry because of the cedar. Not so. It is too sweet to my olfactory sense. The (cheap smelling) amber is much stronger than any other component. I also detect vanilla which is offensive to me and not listed. Also, there&#x27;s nary a trace of the bergamot. Overall, the low-quality fragrance elements do not justify the price.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is wonderful, do cut the wick shorter than 1/4 in however or there will be somking.  I cut mine about 1/8 of an inch and let it burn for about 3 hours.</li>
    <li> The candle is so strong, which I like, but it makes the old man cologne style scent hard to bear.&lt;br /&gt;Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> My last review was an error for the wrong candle.The scent Stonehenge is lovely. My husband loves it as well. The candle scent has a great throw. I love it. Will definitely buy another.</li>
    <li> At first I really didn&#x27;t like this candle. There was a hint of baby powder smell the first time I lit it and it was off putting. But after using it a few times, the initial smell has worn off and the candle smells absolutely amazing now. It is a VERY strong candle though. It will overpower almost everything in the room, so hope you like it. I use it in a room adjacent to another room with a Paddywax tobacco and patchouli candle I have and when you go from room to room, the transition is amazing, they pair sooo well together, so I would recommend getting both at the same time.</li>
    <li> Expensive, but so worth it.  The smell is incredible and lasts such a long time.  I will never buy a yankee candle again after sampling this.</li>
    <li> Great masculine scent without smelling like a cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product description says what needs to be said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smoked Cedarwood, Bergamot and Amber.  Great masculine scent in a classy container.  Description says 60 hours - has definitely lasted quite a while and will buy again.</li>
    <li> The candle smells wonderful, however I had to return it as the glass jar was broken.</li>
    <li> This was a handsome candle that looked great with my black/grey decor. The problem is the scent was not to my liking. To me, it smelled like a man&#x27;s cologne, and a very strong one - like a &amp;#34;Hey ladies, look at me&amp;#34; type of cologne. Just not my thing. It over-powered my small condo after just a few minutes of burn time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it to a friend with a large house but haven&#x27;t heard his thoughts on it yet.</li>
    <li> I love this brand.  They are a bit smokey when put out.  This scent can be used for a holiday scent.</li>
    <li> Hard to find these in the stores.  Ran accross them years ago and was very impressed with how the smell doesn&#x27;t fade away like so many other candles.  This is one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> Awesome enchanting fragrance!</li>
    <li> Just what I was expecting, Happy with this long lasting spicy , musky scented candle. I will be orderering more!</li>
    <li> Wife and I ran across this scent while shopping and had to have it.  Yeah it&#x27;s a bit more pricey than what I wanted to pay but this candle has lasted longer than previous brands and the scent is great.  Shipping was fast as usual so I&#x27;m happy.  I like the simple design of the container which adds elegance, while keeping the dripping wax in check.</li>
    <li> Using it for the Hurricane Candle Warmer Lantern and the scent is wonderful! Slightly on the masculine side, which I enjoy because I don&#x27;t want my apt smelling like flowers and what not, and my wife enjoys it as it reminds her of me somehow (her words, not mine). So we have found a perfect balance in our house for this candle. Highly recommend it, especially if you are using it for a candle warmer. The scent does fad over time, but we have been using this candle for several months now and let it simmer all day long and it still makes the apt smell refreshing when we come home. Very clean and not overpowering (IMO). Would recommend this one!</li>
    <li> this candle is a blend of cedar wood, bergamot and amber, all of which I love. The candles are of&lt;br /&gt;good quality, burn well, and even have a strong smell when not lit. I bought 2 more.</li>
