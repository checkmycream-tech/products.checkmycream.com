### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>and I get a great shave.</li>
      <li>Great deal.</li>
      <li>At this price, they are a great value.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve experienced with a DE blade.  </li>
      <li>Obviously a good quality blade.</li>
      <li>Good blades</li>
      <li>I have a medium beard and get 5 good shaves per blade.</li>
      <li>good price good service</li>
      <li>Very pleased.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t ask a blade to do more than that at any price!</li>
      <li>But they are good quality--much thinner and more flexible</li>
      <li>And no, I don&#x27;t have a bias against Korean products - I own a Kia Optima and thought it was a better made, much better driving (not to mention vastly more attractive) car than the Accord, Camry, Altima, Fusion or Malibu.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I am very pleased with these blades and would recomend them to anyone who wants a good quality blade for a good price.</li>
      <li>These give me the best shave with comfort and [usually] no blood.</li>
      <li>awesome product good flex very sharp but does not tear up my skin</li>
      <li>Now I use them in a more aggressive Merkur and in a Feather lightweight razor.  </li>
      <li>Fits the razor nicely and shaves smoothly</li>
      <li>, so I&#x27;m just walking around with a bit more barb on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I guess YMMV really comes into play here because I get 5 great shaves out of each</li>
      <li>The Dorco ST301 blades are supposed to be better.</li>
      <li>course you will have to try a  number of blades to determine which work for you, but these are in the top 3 for my face.</li>
      <li>Fast Shipping Good Product</li>
      <li>and I easily get</li>
      <li>And for what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;m using a Feather Popular DE razor, which is quite a forgiving, comfortable razor, as its partiallyplastic frame gives some flex.</li>
      <li>A super close, comfortable shave every time with no irritation!  </li>
      <li>Cheap razors, work fine.</li>
      <li>I was very impressed with how they shined my dome (I&#x27;m a head shaver) both the first and second time, but when I pulled the blade across my throat and cheeks two days after the first shave with them, I could tell that the whiskers were winning.  </li>
      <li>Cheap look but at a cheap price</li>
      <li>So smooth at 1st</li>
      <li>I thought it wasn&#x27;t working but comfortable so smooth you couldn&#x27;t feel the shave.</li>
      <li>I start the shaving week every Sunday with 2 days worth of stubble on my face and they have been fabulous.</li>
      <li>reference, my favorite DE blades are 7 O&#x27;Clock Blacks, Blue Birds, and Cromas, all of which are superior in the 3 main categories of blade characteristics, smoothness, closeness, and durability.  </li>
      <li>They are extremely sharp, and do a great job.  </li>
      <li>Product arrived quickly, used for 1st shave when razor arrived yesterday.</li>
      <li>I have been using these blades to trim my spun deer hair bass bugs for fly fishing.  </li>
      <li>These are my new favorite.</li>
      <li>They work excellent going to last a long time...</li>
      <li>They are very good for newbies, it&#x27;s almost as hard to cut yourself with these as with a cart.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re good and sharp and do exactly what he wants them to do.</li>
      <li>I ordered these for my first DE razor blades.</li>
      <li>They immediately left noticeably more stubble still on my face, the blade tugged at my skin and I got a cut on my cheek where I almost never, ever have cuts.</li>
      <li>blade(probably could get more, but I only shave 5 x per week) and have for well over a year now.</li>
      <li>Next come Personna Reds (very close and smooth but only for 2, maybe 3 shaves before becoming much duller).  </li>
      <li>Tried this after using a feather hi-stainless, as it was much cheaper</li>
      <li>Lasts MUCH longer than corner store off market brands.</li>
      <li>and it was noticeably smoother and closer than the brand new Dorco.</li>
      <li>Way cheaper to use than any of the new razors</li>
      <li>Perhaps after my face adjusts to these razors, I will have to change it up again, but for now these are my new favorite.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was surprised at the quality.  </li>
      <li>The blades made my skin feel soft.</li>
      <li>I recommend starting with these, then moving on to a sharper blade if you find it&#x27;s not cutting well enough.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t really have much to say about them other he loves the blades.</li>
      <li>However, this means that you need 4 passes usually to get a smooth shave.</li>
      <li>The only thing that has given me as many cuts was a Feather the first time I tried one and that blade is too sharp, not too dull like the Dorcos.  </li>
      <li>They seemed like an extreme economy, 3rd-world manufactured blade, as they were thicker than normal, did not seem to have any finish on them and were bare metal with no logo.</li>

<li> By storing the razor head in baby oil the blades last a long time.</li>
<li> also I just started wet shaving in the last couple of weeks I used to use electric for years</li>
<li> I was utterly astonished when I saw the other reviews giving this blade 4-and-5-star ratings.  </li>
<li> It was the dullest, least close, least smooth shave</li>
<li> Since I only do a few bugs a month, this order will last me quite a while.</li>
<li> After that, I&#x27;d rank the Astras up there as a terrific value blade at around a dime a piece, followed by 7 O&#x27;Clock Yellows and Greens, with Lord Supers and Derbys rounding out the acceptable quality level; I haven&#x27;t liked any of the Supermax, Trig or Treet blades I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
<li> I gave up with the Dorco by the time I had shaved only half my face</li>
<li> I can usually do two to three bass bugs with one blade, which is about normal.  </li>
<li> Got a few with a razor I bought some months back.</li>
<li> and I expected it to be made in Korea.</li>
<li> A brand new Dorco is worse than a feather that I have used for over a week.</li>
<li> The blades on my tough face, anyway, are not holding up, near as I can tell.  </li>
<li> I have tried at least 20 different razor blades, including the Lord, Nacet, Personna, Iridium, Astra, Feather, Merkur, 6 O&#x27;Clock, Derby, Shark, and others.</li>
<li> I have tried close to 25 different DE blades and hands down, this was by far the worst.  </li>
<li> Then they get dull, and don&#x27;t cut well.  </li>
<li> and I finished up the shave with a Schick Hydra 5 cartridge razor that had at least 20 shaves on it</li>
<li> than I thought they would be--perfect for cutting facial hair instead of slicing cardboard and drywall.</li>
<li> These are for my Merkur Razor which now cannot be used because a piece of it fell into the sink pipes, irretrievable by my useless skill level.  </li>
<li> At 0.14 a blade you can&#x27;t go wrong here.  </li>
<li> It was very bad in quality..</li>

At this price, they are a great value.  I can usually do two to three bass bugs with one blade, which is about normal.  Then they get dull, and don&#x27;t cut well.

    <li> Fast Shipping Good Product</li>
    <li> It turn-out that i did not need it this, after all</li>
    <li> Cheap look but at a cheap price</li>
    <li> awesome product good flex very sharp but does not tear up my skin and I easily get 4-5 shaves from each side of the blade also I just started wet shaving in the last couple of weeks I used to use electric for years</li>
    <li> I was utterly astonished when I saw the other reviews giving this blade 4-and-5-star ratings.  I have tried close to 25 different DE blades and hands down, this was by far the worst.

I gave up with the Dorco by the time I had shaved only half my face and I finished up the shave with a Schick Hydra 5 cartridge razor that had at least 20 shaves on it and it was noticeably smoother and closer than the brand new Dorco. Seems like the Dorco blade was made in North Korea, not South Korea. And no, I don&#x27;t have a bias against Korean products - I own a Kia Optima and thought it was a better made, much better driving (not to mention vastly more attractive) car than the Accord, Camry, Altima, Fusion or Malibu.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference, my favorite DE blades are 7 O&#x27;Clock Blacks, Blue Birds, and Cromas, all of which are superior in the 3 main categories of blade characteristics, smoothness, closeness, and durability.

And for what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;m using a Feather Popular DE razor, which is quite a forgiving, comfortable razor, as its partiallyplastic frame gives some flex.</li>
    <li> Great deal. I shave my head and face and a blade will last 4 shaves before I need to replace it.  Saved a ton of money going to this type of razor, compared to the &amp;#34;4-5 blade&amp;#34; disposable razors.</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly, used for 1st shave when razor arrived yesterday. So smooth at 1st I thought it wasn&#x27;t working but comfortable so smooth you couldn&#x27;t feel the shave.</li>
    <li> A super close, comfortable shave every time with no irritation!  At 0.14 a blade you can&#x27;t go wrong here.  Consider these blades if you shave with a traditional double-edge razor.</li>
    <li> I been using gillette but I tried dorco based on the reviews and I won&#x27;t change it.</li>
    <li> Got these for the husband. Don&#x27;t really have much to say about them other he loves the blades. They&#x27;re good and sharp and do exactly what he wants them to do.</li>
    <li> Cheap razors, work fine.</li>
    <li> I received a package of these blades with a razor.  I was surprised at the quality.  I have a medium beard and get 5 good shaves per blade. No cuts or razor irritation. The Dorco ST301 blades are supposed to be better. I will try them in the future.</li>
    <li> Tried this after using a feather hi-stainless, as it was much cheaper and I wanted to see if there was a difference. A brand new Dorco is worse than a feather that I have used for over a week. The blade is made in Vietnam and I expected it to be made in Korea. Tried both on the feather safety razor.</li>
    <li> I shave with these every day and I guess YMMV really comes into play here because I get 5 great shaves out of each blade(probably could get more, but I only shave 5 x per week) and have for well over a year now. I start the shaving week every Sunday with 2 days worth of stubble on my face and they have been fabulous. I couldn&#x27;t ask a blade to do more than that at any price!</li>
    <li> The blades on my tough face, anyway, are not holding up, near as I can tell.  I was very impressed with how they shined my dome (I&#x27;m a head shaver) both the first and second time, but when I pulled the blade across my throat and cheeks two days after the first shave with them, I could tell that the whiskers were winning.  I&#x27;m too green and timid to really push it, so I&#x27;m just walking around with a bit more barb on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you aren&#x27;t heavy-bearded, these likely would do well for you.</li>
    <li> The blades made my skin feel soft.</li>
    <li> Good blades good price good service What else do you need?</li>
    <li> They provide a closer shave than the double razors and electric that I also tried.  By storing the razor head in baby oil the blades last a long time.</li>
    <li> These are my new favorite. I was using a Jagger DE razor, but it broke. Now I use them in a more aggressive Merkur and in a Feather lightweight razor.  These give me the best shave with comfort and [usually] no blood. They last a while, too.  Perhaps after my face adjusts to these razors, I will have to change it up again, but for now these are my new favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course you will have to try a  number of blades to determine which work for you, but these are in the top 3 for my face. I have tried at least 20 different razor blades, including the Lord, Nacet, Personna, Iridium, Astra, Feather, Merkur, 6 O&#x27;Clock, Derby, Shark, and others.</li>
    <li> It was very bad in quality..</li>
    <li> These are for my Merkur Razor which now cannot be used because a piece of it fell into the sink pipes, irretrievable by my useless skill level.  But they are good quality--much thinner and more flexible than I thought they would be--perfect for cutting facial hair instead of slicing cardboard and drywall.</li>
    <li> five star, enough said</li>
    <li> I like these. Got a few with a razor I bought some months back. Way cheaper to use than any of the new razors and I get a great shave.</li>
    <li> These are some blades u can count on!</li>
    <li> Fits the razor nicely and shaves smoothly</li>
    <li> Very pleased. Obviously a good quality blade. Lasts MUCH longer than corner store off market brands. I&#x27;m not a blade conisour but I am very pleased with these blades and would recomend them to anyone who wants a good quality blade for a good price.</li>
