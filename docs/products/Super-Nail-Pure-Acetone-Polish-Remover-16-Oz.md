<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Delivered was fast and good product.</li>
    <li> After moving i had gone to a nail salon for a set of artificial nails.  I did not like the way they looked but after a few weeks decided I could not&lt;br /&gt;have them on my fingers any longer.  I did not want to go and pay to have them removed  So I got this pure Acetone and went about soaking my nails.  I did have to soak a bit of course but they nails came off fairly easy without any permanent damage. Very pleased with his product.</li>
    <li> This will strip even glitter polish off in a flash without wrecking your nails or skin.</li>
    <li> I use this to remove blue hair dye from my bathtub and skin. Make sure you ventilate!!</li>
    <li> I was looking for something to easily remove glitter nail polish which as you know if very difficult to remove....this stuff was amazing. It took off every bit of the glitter polish...nothing left stuck to my nails. It makes super quick work of regular polish and I only end up using 1 cotton ball per hand. It does dry out your cuticles a bit, but I only use it once a week and keep cuticle oil on hand to re-hydrate them.  I will never go back to regular polish remover. This is the best!!</li>
    <li> Works great, better bargain than store polish remover which, I suspect, is diluted.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good but it&#x27;s OVER PRICED!</li>
    <li> Works great, as any pure acetone product would</li>
    <li> This product did not take off my gel polish any better than regular polish remover. Save your money and time and stick with the $1 drug store remover.</li>
    <li> All these years I have been using regular nail polish remover.  Had no idea how quick and easy it is to remove polish with this pure acetone!</li>
    <li> Increased my gas mileage</li>
    <li> Best nail polish remover I have used</li>
    <li> Good price.  It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do- remove nail polish.</li>
    <li> regular drug store polish remover does not ever take all the color off as well as this product does. The pure acetone is a little rough on the hands but some good lotion and hand masks do the trick.</li>
    <li> Works great. Very strong. Pure acetone!</li>
    <li> So many things I use this for. Love it!</li>
    <li> Great acetone and cheaper than what I pay in Drug stores and Supermarkets. I ordered the 16oz and its huge 😍😍 I&#x27;ll be needing a new bottle in no time 😭🙌</li>
    <li> does what it says to do</li>
    <li> Acetone is the best remedy for getting rid of cold sores (herpes virus) .&lt;br /&gt;Just take this product soak a q-tip  and apply to cold sore or any herpes lesions ,&lt;br /&gt;for anywere between 5 to 30 minutes  3 times a day. note it BURNS !  test on inner forearm first before trying on face or other sensitive areas.</li>
    <li> NEVER BUYING NORMAL NAIL POLISH REMOVER AGAIN!!! THIS STUFF IS 10000000 TIMES BETTER AND MORE EFFECTIVE, I WILL BE BUYING THIS FOREVER!</li>
    <li> Great price...and I won&#x27;t have to buy any for quite some time!</li>
    <li> Best nail polish remover .</li>
    <li> Works fast. I like that it is clear with no color.</li>
    <li> It met my expectation.</li>
    <li> This took off my glitter polish tons faster than the non acetone stuff did!</li>
    <li> Great product!  Works Wonderful when fixing my lines on french manicure!&lt;br /&gt;PROS....THIS ITEM WAS IN FACT INDICATING THAT IT WOULD BE &amp;#34;PRIME&amp;#34; HOWEVER, I DID NOT RECEIVE IT UNTIL AFTER 2 WEEKS! ORDERED IT 05/18/2015 RECEIVED 06/01/82015!</li>
    <li> Took barbie&#x27;s face makeup RIGHT OFF! :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which is why I bought it, so: Woot!</li>
    <li> It works beautifully for both gel nails and regular nail polish. In less than 15 min the gel was ready to peel off without forcing the polish and/or damaging my nails. It has a decent scent as well.</li>
    <li> Good product and works well.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS FOR YOUR NAILS!!! It&#x27;s horribly drying. It ruined my nails, dried them out so bad!!! ALL my nails dried and broke off. I ran out of the Gelish brand and I thought I would get this big bottle for less money and it&#x27;s like industrial paint thinner. BAD NEWS! My nails are just now growing out and looking healthy again.</li>
    <li> Exactly as explained, not sure of purity though?  Would appreciate if some in depth reviewer could view the scientific analysis, not &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; by any means though.</li>
    <li> This is advertised as 16 ounces but I only received a 4 ounce bottle.</li>
    <li> I use this to take off a gel manicure and it works like a charm and makes the gel come off cleanly.</li>
    <li> Good value for money. It works well</li>
    <li> This is just what I ordered but the shipping pack is awful came all soaked and half the contents had leaked out</li>
    <li> I use this to prep Kapton tape on my MakerBot 2x.  Works like a charm to keep ABS down on the surface.</li>
    <li> Very good for removing Acrylic/Solar nails as well as faux nails. Product arrived quickly, no spillage.  Grat packaging.</li>
    <li> the best nail polish remover. super quick and easy removes any polish even glitter ones.</li>
    <li> LOVE this. Pure acetone, makes polish removal a cinch.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this acetone. An very fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery! Works very well! Good price for size of bottle. I will order more when I run put. All in all, good product!</li>
    <li> Takes nail polish off great.  no problems</li>
    <li> This removes my polish in one swipe of a cotton ball.  It also takes off the hard-to-remove confetti polish easily.  I now think regular remover is way too slow, lol!  The smell dissipates quickly and after using the remove I rub on some argan oil to moisturize my cuticles.  I also use it after doing a manicure and before applying polish, just to make sure my nail bed is completely dry.  I find polish lasts much longer when I do this.  I could never go back to regular remover now!  This is a good buy, with the 16 ounce size only a little more than the 8 ounce one.  I hadn&#x27;t used this brand before but I quite like it.  I figure that the quicker the polish is removed, the less time the remover actually spends on my nails. I definitely recommend 100% acetone nail polish remover over regular formulas.</li>
    <li> love this produce it works great everytime.</li>
    <li> This works great! One splash on a cottonball and it removes layers of nail polish on all my fingers. Quick and easy!</li>
    <li> Supernail Pure Acetone - 16 oz., works just great removing nail polish, both cleanly &amp; quickly! Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working fine.</li>
    <li> i go through a lot of nail polish remover since i love bright neon nail colors but don&#x27;t like to wear them at work..it&#x27;s a huge bottle, is decently priced, and takes off my nail polish, even the glittery ones, quickly and effortlessly...i hate fake nails so im not sure if it&#x27;s any good for taking off fake nails, but it&#x27;s great for removing nail polish...the non-acetone stuff they sell at the store just doesn&#x27;t work...i haven&#x27;t noticed it drying out my skin.</li>
    <li> Pure acetone. Shipped without a leak.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful.  It actually removes nail polish quickly.</li>
    <li> Nice size and good price</li>
    <li> Works AMAZING. Lightning fast. If you&#x27;re sick of taking hundreds of cotton balls to your nails everytime you take off polish. Get this. One cotton ball dipped one time will do all ten nails.</li>
    <li> Love pure acetone, no scrubbing to get sparkle and other hard to remove polishes off. It&#x27;s a time saver and my nails are much healthier with less wear and tear to get polish off.</li>
    <li> Hard to say I love nail polish remover so didn&#x27;t give 5 stars - oh what the heck... this is great stuff to remove gel nail polish.  I soak my nails in it for 10 - 15 minutes the night before I go to the salon, while watching tv,  so I don&#x27;t have to sit doing nothing at the salon.  I get in and out of the salon much faster.  Fyi, the best way to use this is to first gently file the gel polish with an emory board to get the very top off, then pour some of this acetone in to a small bowl and soak your nails.</li>
    <li> My second replacement vat. I love this stuff. It chews right through my gel manicures in 10 minutes without needing additional or extended applications. My last vat lasted an eon. I really haven&#x27;t encountered anything close to the cuticle dryness using this for a soak off as I have with other brands I&#x27;ve tried. It works well so that there&#x27;s no scraping of my nail plate and outperforms other, more costly options. For conventional polishes it&#x27;s a quick wipe to remove completely. Snap! Yay.</li>
    <li> It is indeed 100% acetone. I used it as a solvent to clean some tough to clean objects. 10/10, would acetone again.</li>
    <li> Pure and strong.  Cleaned the nozzle of my spray foam can and cleared the tube of the leftover sticky foam in minutes.  I simply let it sit in the acetone in a ziplock bag.</li>
    <li> Nail polish remover that works the first time! You&#x27;ll have to give up a few things; there&#x27;ll be no more using 1/4 of the bottle on one nail; no need to set aside half a day to chisel off your old polish; no more need for colorful language before noon. I think I can l do that.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a chemical.  How much can you love it?</li>
    <li> Removes gel polish in mins with soaked cotton balls and foil.</li>
    <li> I have used better gel nail polish remover. You do have to soak your nail for a while for this to work. Don&#x27;t use this on a surface you don&#x27;t want the finish to come off.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected - pure acetone, cleans acrylic brushes well.</li>
    <li> This stuff is strong, I&#x27;ve used it to even get stains off my desk, everything comes right up!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and intact. Worked well to remove my false nails.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, nice product</li>
    <li> Pure acetone gets the job done, quickly removes nail polish. This bottle should last me quite some time since i&#x27;m the only one using it! - Review by wife :)</li>
    <li> It is what it is. Works well.</li>
    <li> Just as expected. Removes nail polish well.</li>
    <li> The bottle was well packaged and arrived intact. It works great and was a very fair price.</li>
    <li> Product as described, arrived quick and sealed well, thank you!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a year that I am buying this product and I had no issue so far.</li>
    <li> I purchased this acetone because the previous nail polish remover I was using wasn&#x27;t doing a great job getting all of the polish off. I needed something stronger so I purchased this bottle of pure acetone. This acetone makes getting nail polish off incredibly easy--no scrubbing, and it&#x27;s super effective!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only that, but it&#x27;s pretty good for super glue mess ups. My boyfriend had accidentally super glued his charging cable in an odd way and needed something to get the glue off. I told him to try this acetone, and it worked! Now you know that not only does this work as a nail polish remover, but it doubles as a glue remover!</li>
    <li> Fastest acting nail polish remover ever. Also, neat trick, you can use this to clean cloudy car headlights.</li>
    <li> I wanted to remove my gel polish</li>
    <li> Does the job SOAKING off my gel nails, nice amount.  What else can I say, it is \\&quot;Pure Acetone\\&quot; and there it is.  Takes off REGULAR nail polish great too with just a cotton ball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who says it \\&quot;doesn&#x27;t take off gel nail polish well\\&quot; or \\&quot;it needs like 20 minutes\\&quot;.. here are some tips from a 48 year old hospital RN and mom of 3, who is obsessed with NOT paying salons to do her gel nails, I&#x27;ve been doing my own manicures at home for me and my friends and family for over a year now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIRST! PREP GEL NAILS for REMOVAL by SCUFFING UP the SURFACE of the polish with a very very rough nail file (like an acrylic nail file, under a $1 at any beauty store).  Just a few swipes per nail, you don&#x27;t have to be perfect, or thorough, just scuff it up a bit.  If you only have a regular nail file, that can work too.  You want to prep the nail polish to help the acetone soak in to loosen it up FASTER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#1) pour about an inch OR inch and a half of acetone in a very small GLASS container (like a teacup or something if you don&#x27;t have anything else handy)&lt;br /&gt;#2) set the SMALL GLASS container with the acetone in a small bowl that has about 2 inches of \\&quot;COFFEE~HOT\\&quot; PLAIN WATER in it, let the acetone warm a moment or two (or not, doesn&#x27;t matter)&lt;br /&gt;#3) put one hand&#x27;s worth of nails in the acetone, making sure to submerge ALL of the nail/s, BEND those fingers down to get all the nail under the acetone!&lt;br /&gt;  ---&gt;NOTE: you may feel a slight burn or sting for a moment or two if you have any micro cuts or skin imperfections, it goes away pretty fast, just stick it out, it gets better ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#4) check the nails in about 7 minutes, to see if the polish is starting to peel off well (little flecks will be seen lifting outward away from nail)&lt;br /&gt;#5) if no or minimal flecks of peeling polish aren&#x27;t present, soak for 3 more minutes while you are continuing to drink your coffee &amp; reading your kindle (like me)&lt;br /&gt;#6) after 7 - 10 total minutes, put your nails on a paper towel and use a cuticle stick, or a metal nail scraper (much better) to scrape/peel off the polish&lt;br /&gt;#7) if some small portions are harder to come off, soak that nail for one more minute&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#8)...... repeat with the other hand&#x27;s nails, but change out the hot water in the bowl because by this time, it has cooled, and so has the acetone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#9) when you are done, pour the remaining acetone carefully back in the container.  Not a lot of \\&quot;flecks\\&quot; really go into the acetone I find, so I reuse the clean acetone.  OH... but use &amp; pour where you can tolerate an ACETONE SPILL!  Like IN the sink or something.  This WILL remove varnish from a table, so I always work with newspaper or a couple paper towels underneath when I&#x27;m drinking coffee at the table or similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHEN DONE, WASH YOUR HANDS WITH A MILD SOAP AND WARM WATER.  Do NOT use any lotion if you are going to do another gel manicure immediately. Acetone is very drying, and you&#x27;ll have white residue on your fingers, just wash it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some manicures come off faster than others, if you find it is taking up to 10 minutes, you probably have several coats (like me).  With this method, I NEVER go beyond 10 minute soak off for each hand. YES, you can do both hands at the same time (with bigger glass containers), but I find I can&#x27;t turn the pages of my kindle button or drink my coffee with 2 hands in the stuff.  Not using BOTH your hands for 10 minutes or so is just BORING, so I do one at a time, when I know no one will disturb me. If done properly, you should never have to go beyond the 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve done the cotton ball and foil thing (stupid looking and not as effective and hard to do by yourself), peeling it off thing (ruins my nails, so I stopped), but this method is the one I&#x27;ve been using for over a year now, and it works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHALAA!  DONE and DONE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There ya go, your welcome :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEXT MANICURE PLEASE ;-)put your nails on a paper towel and use a cuticle stick, or a metal nail scraper (much better) to scrape/peel off the polish&lt;br /&gt;#7) if some small portions are harder to come off, soak that nail for one more minute&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#8)...... repeat with the other hand&#x27;s nails, but change out the hot water in the bowl because by this time, it has cooled, and so has the acetone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#9) when you are done, pour the remaining acetone carefully back in the container.

    <li> best nail polish remover ever!! glad I bought this brand good value price for the size</li>
    <li> This stuff works great.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s a difference with other acetone or not, but I like this one. It works well for me and it&#x27;s the only brand I use. The end. Go get yours. It&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> I have tried a hundred different products to remove my nail polish over the years. This is the ONLY one that has removed my polish from all ten toes in less than 30 seconds. I only used one cotton ball AND my fingers aren&#x27;t dried out after application! I&#x27;m over the moon! With how little acetone I had to use, the 16 fl oz bottle is going to last us forever!</li>
    <li> Takes off polish easily.  Dries out skin, though, so be sure to use lotion afterwards.</li>
    <li> Just what a nail expert needs</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this, but my GF does and she says this stuff is amazing. She&#x27;s never used anything more potent, and wants me to buy only this kind ever again for her, for the rest of forever. She thinks it is the kind of potency that they use in nail salons. Any time she uses it, she tells me all about how much she loves it. Well worth the money for a happy household.</li>
    <li> It performs as expected. I bought it to remove gel nail polish. It does the job well. And does the job relatively quickly.</li>
    <li> disappointed I thought it was bigger and a steal for the price, I got the biggest gallon just for 9.00 dollares and these are just 16 ounce theft</li>
    <li> It is nothing special but not bad either. I am neutral on this one.</li>
    <li> It is exactly what it says it is.  Pure acetone.  I forgot how bad acetone smells and how quickly it will remove furniture finish.  I won&#x27;t use this again.  I would rather soak longer than to deal with the smell and difficulty of trying to not get it on anything.</li>
    <li> Great product and great price.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with this purchase, it does the job just as it should.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> Acetone is acetone, but the price for this size bottle is great!</li>
    <li> The acetone&#x27;s purity was as required and the delivery wast timely, thank you</li>
    <li> Takes off polish easily and quickly.  Smell is not overpowering.  Highly recommend.</li>
