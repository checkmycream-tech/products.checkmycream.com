      <li>Nice scent but not lilies of the valley</li>
      <li>Mom was thrilled when I gave her this scent for Christmas.  </li>
      <li>It is way too sweet for me, and like Estee or Beautiful or pleasures or Eternity, can be easily overdone and smell up a room.  </li>
      <li>We have bought this for years as a gift to someone who wears it as her signature perfume and cologne, and it is pretty unforgettable to me.  </li>
      <li>Everything fine!</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t buy it in the department store easy, so it is nice I can buy it&lt;br /&gt;on internet .</li>
      <li>The price is better than the ones sold at airports which have no tax charge.</li>
      <li>Moms favorite for all times.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad that my hard-to-find, all-time favorite scent is available again!  </li>
      <li>I had thought this was a hopeless cause -- that I would never be able to wear this fragrance again or find anything close to it.</li>
      <li>To defy impossibility, Dior capitalized upon his obsession to be creative.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Anyone who likes the scent of muguet du boise or lily of the valley will love this perfume.  </li>
      <li>and I had a wonderful Christmas present.  </li>
      <li>so I LOVE this cologne.  </li>
      <li>I have gotten many comments on it.</li>
      <li>My wife has been using diorissimo eau de toilette for better than 30 years.</li>
      <li>I had used this perfume for many years before coming to this country but never could find it here.  </li>
      <li>She and her sister love this product.</li>
      <li>It has been her favorite for many years</li>
      <li>The wife was pleased with the Christmas package.  </li>
      <li>So glad I can get it on Amazon</li>
      <li>This perfume has the most exotic fragrance of any I have tried.  </li>
      <li>I am sure I will never buy fragrances on the internet.</li>
      <li>and she definitely love it.</li>
      <li>One of my favorite fragrances of all time, and completely authentic.</li>
      <li>In fact, a fine misting over my corpse would be the perfect way to open Heaven&#x27;s doors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Every time coming through London, I always made sure I had a couple of duty free ones purchased.  </li>
      <li>The fragrant is strong.</li>
      <li>Thank I received on time , everything was fantastic ,</li>
      <li>I love the lilly of the valley aroma but this spay is too diluted, so the fragrance doesn&#x27;t stay long, and the aroma is not that good quality.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This creation by the famous French fashion designer, the legendary Christian Dior, is an incomparable masterpiece.</li>
      <li>Diorissimo, with its light, brilliant combination of lily-of-the-valley with a slight nuance of lilac, is one of those.</li>
      <li>I like the single floral fragrance and receive many compliments on &amp;#34;how good</li>
      <li>Finally, success!</li>
      <li>I buy all my wife&#x27;s perfumes and this is the one she likes the best and pretty much the only one she uses.  </li>
      <li>I loved the original DIORISSIMO perfume by Christian Dior.</li>
      <li>This was a special gift for me, as it helped celebrate the three year anniversary of my surgery to remove the cancer in my lung.</li>
      <li>This scent is fantastic, just the right amount of floral to not be over cloying.  </li>
      <li>Since then, this perfume has become her best X-mas present and, searching your site for this present has become my annual ritual.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it has any Lily of the Valley in it any more, which used to be the main ingredient.</li>
      <li>Very romantic perfume, very memorable.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fresh, not overpoweringly sweet -- and I get compliments every time I use it.</li>
      <li>I love Diorissimo , it&#x27;s my favorite Eau De toilet</li>
      <li>Well packaged and fresh.</li>
      <li>This fragrance is made from lillies I believe, but when you first spray it, it almost smells sweet.  </li>
      <li>Thanks for carrying such a hard-to-find good product.</li>
      <li>Because of this, he called it \\&quot;Dior\\&quot; plus an ending of \\&quot;belissimo\\&quot; - an Italian expression that means \\&quot;the most beautiful\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Diorissimo was not only loved by its creator but through the years it has gained and army of enthusiasts and fans and earned a position of prominence on the market.</li>
      <li>It is a harsh aroma, somewhat acidic and not like the original  Diorissmo that I loved and</li>
      <li>This long forgotten fragrance  I use for more than 30 years !</li>
      <li>We were so blessed that we had picked just the right one for her.  </li>
      <li>It also lasts a long time as it is important to be able to smell the scent throughout the day.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite Eau De Cologne by Christian Dior.</li>
      <li>When this is gone I&#x27;ll be back for more.</li>
      <li>It such an enveloping fragrance, it just carries one away to exotic places.  </li>
      <li>A lovely fragrance, but it is very fragile.  </li>
      <li>My wife has been using this perfume for so many years, even I don&#x27;t remember how long, and she doesn&#x27;t want to change her perfume either.</li>
      <li>The essence of Diorissimo is natural because the fragrance is derived from a tiny - but magic - flower, Lilly of the Valley, and it evokes a scent so real that it is like burying my face in a bouquet of these freshly picked flowers.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
      <li>One devotee was the late Princess of Wales, Diana, who made it her signature fragrance as have many people before and after her, and Diorissimo has now become a classic - a truly iconic eau de toilette.</li>
      <li>One devotee was the late Princess of Wales, Diana, who made it her signature fragrance as have many people before and after her, and Diorissimo has now become a classic - a truly iconic eau de toilette.</li>
      <li>story behind the creation of this scent is exceptional and unique.</li>
      <li>Just a tiny thing to add to other reviews that are more articulate about the scent:  whatever flowers are involved, this is very sweet to me.  </li>
      <li>I have grown more sensitive to smells as I age, but I would definitely suggest smelling and wearing this before you buy a large size.</li>
      <li>Later on, he made this flower an emblem for his Parisian fashion emporium and requested in his last will and testament that his coffin be covered only with Lilly of the Valley.&lt;br /&gt;The creation of this fragrance happily fulfilled his ambition because its inimitable scent miraculously achieved what Dior desired.</li>
      <li>Very feminine and distinctive.  </li>
      <li>Very floral, but not smothering.</li>
      <li>Thanks to Amazon for carrying this endangered species.</li>
      <li>However, Dioirssimo can become addictive which was my initial confession.&lt;br /&gt;Magda Wysoczanski, Melbourne, Australia\\&quot;Dior\\&quot; plus an ending of \\&quot;belissimo\\&quot; - an Italian expression that means \\&quot;the most beautiful\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Diorissimo was not only loved by its creator but through the years it has gained and army of enthusiasts and fans and earned a position of prominence on the market.</li>
      <li>but I itu it is strong and not very floral</li>
      <li>Knowing my passion for real lily of the valley, my husband surprised me with a bottle of this fragrance.  </li>
      <li>Unlike other fragrances, once it is sprayed on it does not change but stays fresh and pure.</li>
      <li>Also, it is heavenly enough to be worn during hot, summer weather.</li>

    <li> One of my favorite fragrances of all time, and completely authentic. Well packaged and fresh.</li>
    <li> Thank I received on time , everything was fantastic , the price omg it was the best, the perfume is excellent . It was a gift for my sister bday and she definitely love it.</li>

    <li> Very strange ! I have been using Diorissmo for approximately 30 years, and this bottle does not smell like Diorissmo .  I am disappointed with the product.  I suspect this product has been adulterated either by the factory or the distributor or the company who bottles the product.  It is a harsh aroma, somewhat acidic and not like the original  Diorissmo that I loved and those around me loved too. A learning experience........never buy a pig (or eau de toilette) in a poke.  This was a gift certificate purchase.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item because I used to have this wonderful fragrance before. I love the lilly of the valley aroma but this spay is too diluted, so the fragrance doesn&#x27;t stay long, and the aroma is not that good quality.&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointed.</li>
    <li> I bought these as gifts for my mother-in-law. She and her sister love this product. The price is better than the ones sold at airports which have no tax charge. I will buy this again once they need it again.</li>
    <li> Love it!! I hate that it is not being created anymore!!!</li>
    <li> The package arrived from Florida to Alaska in a superfast time frame.  The wife was pleased with the Christmas package.  We are very happy with the purchase and who we dealt with for the item.  No problems what so over.</li>
    <li> This is one of the all-time great fragrances.  Very feminine and distinctive.  Try it!</li>
    <li> I love Diorissimo , it&#x27;s my favorite Eau De toilet</li>
    <li> A lovely fragrance, but it is very fragile.  I suggest keeping it refrigerated.  It goes bad very quickly.</li>
    <li> I loved the original DIORISSIMO perfume by Christian Dior. This version has hardly any fragrance and the ingredients seem to be different. I don&#x27;t think it has any Lily of the Valley in it any more, which used to be the main ingredient.</li>
    <li> Amazon.com has restored two of the fragrances I wore in my youth, both of which are sensational and evoke wonderful memories for me. Diorissimo, with its light, brilliant combination of lily-of-the-valley with a slight nuance of lilac, is one of those. Dior stopped making this incredible scent years ago, and I was thrilled to find it on Amazon. I had thought this was a hopeless cause -- that I would never be able to wear this fragrance again or find anything close to it. Fragrances today are so light they disappear within seconds of application -- a waste of money and time. The Houses of Dior and Jean Patou were the grand old masters of the perfume world, creating fragrances that would last with a single spritz, would not be heavy or intrusive, and smell like . . . flowers. A good thing. Thanks to Amazon for carrying this endangered species.</li>
    <li> I have used this fragrance for my entire adult life.  My mother used it and I&#x27;ve always loved it.  I hope they never take it away.</li>
    <li> My wife has been using diorissimo eau de toilette for better than 30 years. We heard Christian Dior stopped making it. When I saw it on Amazon I was elated. I bought it for my wife and when she tried it, she was disappointed, she said it was watered down, lot more alcohol in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It short, if we could give it, we would give it 5 thumbs down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bob D</li>
    <li> Nice scent but not lilies of the valley</li>
    <li> For at least 35 years, Diorissimo by Christian Dior had always been my fragrance and even after settling in the U.S. Every time coming through London, I always made sure I had a couple of duty free ones purchased.  For the past three years I was saddened that I could not find it anymore not here nor overseas.  Seeing that Amazon carries it gave me hope to try, although I had the warning in my mind not to fall into temptation as I have heard and read the stories of others...  So today I get the package and unfortunately it was a totally different fragrance, not even a pleasant one.  I am sure I will never buy fragrances on the internet.</li>
    <li> Wonderful if you love lily-of-the-valley. Wore this years ago and was happy to find it again. Very floral, but not smothering.</li>
    <li> Beautiful fragrance of Lily of the Valley!</li>
    <li> My wife just returned from a visit with family in Michigan,  While there she was introduced to the product by a niece. She expressed&lt;br /&gt;her desire for the item and I a was able to get her twice the quantity for a very good price. When this is gone I&#x27;ll be back for more.</li>
    <li> This is a difficult scent to find.  And when I did see it in the local mall, it cost $90 for a much smaller bottls.  Mom was thrilled when I gave her this scent for Christmas.  It has been her favorite for many years and she didn&#x27;t expect to get it.</li>
    <li> Knowing my passion for real lily of the valley, my husband surprised me with a bottle of this fragrance.  I usually can&#x27;t abide floral scents because tney don&#x27;t measure up to the real flower but, in this case, that doesn&#x27;t follow.  This scent is fantastic, just the right amount of floral to not be over cloying.  This was a special gift for me, as it helped celebrate the three year anniversary of my surgery to remove the cancer in my lung.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite Eau De Cologne by Christian Dior. I hope it remains available until I&#x27;m dead. In fact, a fine misting over my corpse would be the perfect way to open Heaven&#x27;s doors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m expecting that fragrance will be wafting around the Gardens of Eden.</li>
    <li> We bought this for our (so to speak) &amp;#34;adopted Danish daughter&amp;#34; for her birthday wanting it to be a suprise and oh what a suprise it was.  She called and was crying from &amp;#34;Joy&amp;#34; because no one, in all of her years, had every given her such a &amp;#34;gift&amp;#34; that would ONLY be fore her.  We were so blessed that we had picked just the right one for her.  It was wonderful and smelled more wonderful than we had expected.</li>
    <li> I like lilies-of-the-valley so I LOVE this cologne.  I like the single floral fragrance and receive many compliments on &amp;#34;how good I smell&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> &#x60;Diorissimo&#x27; by Dior&lt;br /&gt;I have used Diorissimo fragrance all my life, and this will seem like a secret confession, and it is. No other scent compares with it, and my guess is that there never will be. This creation by the famous French fashion designer, the legendary Christian Dior, is an incomparable masterpiece. The essence of Diorissimo is natural because the fragrance is derived from a tiny - but magic - flower, Lilly of the Valley, and it evokes a scent so real that it is like burying my face in a bouquet of these freshly picked flowers.&lt;br /&gt;Once applied, the scent remains the same and does not change with time. Unlike other fragrances, once it is sprayed on it does not change but stays fresh and pure. Although luxurious, it is also surprisingly \\&quot;wearable\\&quot; and is suitable for evening occasions because of its sophistication and elegance. In addition to these features, it is so light and subtle that it can be used during the day. Also, it is heavenly enough to be worn during hot, summer weather. Diorissimo is wonderfully refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;The story behind the creation of this scent is exceptional and unique. To defy impossibility, Dior capitalized upon his obsession to be creative. He set out to make a noticeably distinctive scent and to contain it in a bottle. His life-long fascination for this inimitable fragrance came from this inconspicuous little flower which was a favourite of his. Dior planted Lilly of the Valley profusely in his garden; his house was filled with vases of these delicate little flowers; and he even wore them pinned to his lapel. Later on, he made this flower an emblem for his Parisian fashion emporium and requested in his last will and testament that his coffin be covered only with Lilly of the Valley.&lt;br /&gt;The creation of this fragrance happily fulfilled his ambition because its inimitable scent miraculously achieved what Dior desired. He loved it and thought it to be the most exquisite of all his perfumes. Because of this, he called it \\&quot;Dior\\&quot; plus an ending of \\&quot;belissimo\\&quot; - an Italian expression that means \\&quot;the most beautiful\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Diorissimo was not only loved by its creator but through the years it has gained and army of enthusiasts and fans and earned a position of prominence on the market. One devotee was the late Princess of Wales, Diana, who made it her signature fragrance as have many people before and after her, and Diorissimo has now become a classic - a truly iconic eau de toilette. However, Dioirssimo can become addictive which was my initial confession.&lt;br /&gt;Magda Wysoczanski, Melbourne, Australia\\&quot;Dior\\&quot; plus an ending of \\&quot;belissimo\\&quot; - an Italian expression that means \\&quot;the most beautiful\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Diorissimo was not only loved by its creator but through the years it has gained and army of enthusiasts and fans and earned a position of prominence on the market.

    <li> I love this perfume - it is a classic single note fragrance (lily of the valley) and is hard to find in store.  So glad I can get it on Amazon</li>
    <li> The problem of ordering this type of item on Amazon is that if you do not like the scent (or for any other reason) you cannot return the item.  Although this is stated in the product description, it is surprising as most items from Amazon can be returned. In this case I did not notice the non-return disclosure.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been asking perfume counters about this scent for years, to no avail. Finally, success! Wonderful.</li>
    <li> I had used this perfume for many years before coming to this country but never could find it here.  My husband found it on Amazon and I had a wonderful Christmas present.  Anyone who likes the scent of muguet du boise or lily of the valley will love this perfume.  It is light, perfect for every day and suits most skin tones.</li>
    <li> Long, lasting cense. Love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s original</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this perfume for so many years, even I don&#x27;t remember how long, and she doesn&#x27;t want to change her perfume either. This product has been usually available at high-end department stores, but somehow, those stores have stopped carrying this product and my wife has been purchasing this product in foreign countries while traveling, usually at airports. Then, a couple of years ago, accidently, I have found this product at your site during my hectic X-mas shopping spree. Since then, this perfume has become her best X-mas present and, searching your site for this present has become my annual ritual. The X-mas special/discount for this product has been nothing but an icing on the cake for me also. Thanks for carrying such a hard-to-find good product.</li>
    <li> Years ago I used to buy Diorissimo from France,  I simply loved that perfume...the scent would last all day ...Sadly this new Diorissimo I just bought is not at all the product I remember...the scent will last for 1/2  hour or less...it is not worth the money I paid for..I would not recommend it to anyone who knows good perfume and appreciate them</li>
    <li> Again, I was looking for this fragrance for a long time.  I didn&#x27;t realize that it had been discontinued.  To my surprise I found it on Amazon (go figure!!!).  This fragrance is made from lillies I believe, but when you first spray it, it almost smells sweet.  After a short time it wears down to such an exotic fragrance.  I have received several compliments.  I loved it years ago and love it now.  You can wear it anytime.  It such an enveloping fragrance, it just carries one away to exotic places.  Its a great fragrance.  I can now see why Christian Dior had these flowers all over his estate.  Its just...dreamy...</li>
    <li> Buy this for my wife.  I buy all my wife&#x27;s perfumes and this is the one she likes the best and pretty much the only one she uses.  It pleases her, and, because of that, it pleases me.</li>
    <li> The fragrant is strong. Two bursts are sufficient to last a whole day.&lt;br /&gt;And this is eau de toilette, not eau de parfum !</li>
    <li> A gift for my mother-in-law. She loved it, is the one perfume she puts on. She being an exeptionally solar and wonderful woman,makes me believe this perfume deserves the 5 stars</li>
    <li> Moms favorite for all times. For some reason she thinks it smells like lilacs though. Very romantic perfume, very memorable.</li>
    <li> Does not smell the same as it used to.  It has a heavy base scent which is irritating to my allergies.  Hope to return it as it&#x27;s expensive.  It smells like lily of the valley days after it has evaporated but I itu it is strong and not very floral</li>
    <li> Thank you! Everything fine!</li>
    <li> Lily of the Valley perfection, as though I were holding a tiny, white bell-bloom Lily of the Valley bouquet in my hands as I did on my wedding day. Diorissimo is my signature!</li>
    <li> This long forgotten fragrance  I use for more than 30 years ! You can&#x27;t buy it in the department store easy, so it is nice I can buy it&lt;br /&gt;on internet . Lilly of Valley in different names and companies still not the same. Thank you Amazon.com</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad that my hard-to-find, all-time favorite scent is available again!  No other fragrance comes close to it for me.  It&#x27;s fresh, not overpoweringly sweet -- and I get compliments every time I use it.</li>
