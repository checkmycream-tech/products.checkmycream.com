      <li>These are awesome!</li>
      <li>The sizes are perfect and they&#x27;re a great quality.</li>
      <li>I loved these rhinestones!</li>
      <li>and these are great for adding a shimmery detail.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m extremely happy with them.</li>
      <li>Great product, plenty of each size.</li>
      <li>this is great for price.</li>
      <li>I love the fact that is product has an awesomeness range in rhinestone sizes!!</li>
      <li>This one is very nice</li>
      <li>They look really good .</li>
      <li>But nonetheless its still good</li>
      <li>and she loved them .</li>
      <li>Perfect, very pretty.</li>
      <li>Product is ok.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>The picture gave the impression that there were more than what was in the package.</li>
      <li>The wheel is very neat and organized and the gems are great.</li>
      <li>I love doing interesting nail art</li>
      <li>I figured I would just keep the pearls and just order more rhinestones</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>has all sorts of sized :)</li>
      <li>won&#x27;t b able to get them out or could scratch them up.</li>
      <li>For the price, I guess it&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t even get the right order of rhinestones!!..</li>
      <li>The range was better than i originally thought it would be.</li>
      <li>Let me just say that none of the sizes were mixed up, and they give you a very good amount for each size (about 2/3 slots full).</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s still cheap</li>
      <li>Some of the sections of the wheels are barely full.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re not dull like most gems you&#x27;d find at this price.</li>
      <li>They come in different sizes and there&#x27;s so many of them to use!</li>
      <li>the price is right .</li>
      <li>the container is actually pretty small(about 2inch in diameter) but the rhinestones seemed all to be in the right place.</li>
      <li>And I will definately order from this company again in the future, especially for their great prices.</li>
      <li>but they are pretty and the case holds the rhinestones well.</li>
      <li>It was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>My only complain would be that there is a gap in between the top and bottom portion where the rhinestones are so they can slide out of the container.</li>
      <li>love it, but I though they were for nails, but they&#x27;re too big.</li>
      <li>I received the product the first day it said it would arrive</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re exactly what I ordered and what I wanted.</li>
      <li>still pretty content tho.</li>
      <li>they are ok but not crystals like I expected, more plastic with round top rather than geometric shape of rhinestones...</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think jewels will be falling out rather than due to my own carelessness; That is to say, it&#x27;s well made.</li>
      <li>They arrived a week earlier from its expected delivery date, which is great.</li>
      <li>There are only about 3/4 different sizes, what they did was just include a good amount of each size.</li>
      <li>They arrived pretty fast.</li>
      <li>And didn&#x27;t expect the free gift of different nail tip decals to use for different nail designs such as chevron and french tip nails, which was also great</li>
      <li>And very practical packaging.</li>
      <li>, they just really don&#x27;t offer you much in the way of jewels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t really mind</li>
      <li>REALLY???</li>
      <li>Everything was in tact and very well packaged.</li>
      <li>Very displeased.</li>
      <li>but there actually is only 3 sizes and the containers aren&#x27;t really full.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t actually used the product as yet but it looks pretty decent.</li>
      <li>At first i thought i made the error when purchasing it, but looking back and looking at it now.</li>
      <li>I was also surprised at how little jewels there are compared to the space available.</li>
      <li>they look like clear plastic domes</li>
      <li>I was hopping for a few more different sizes bit</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t say how many pieces of the various sizes you get, and there are not many.</li>
      <li>will still get a few uses out of this (hopefully) and the jewels are in fact different sizes (looks more like 4 than 12 different sizes to me, but what do I know).</li>
      <li>That being said, I suggest taking a long hard look at this photo before making the purchase, because the closer I look at the photo, the more I&#x27;m realizing it&#x27;s not that far off</li>
      <li>super small not what i expected very disapionted</li>
      <li>I only encountered one large rhinestone that was missing the reflective back</li>

<li> /&gt;There are all flat back pearls,but there have different size.&lt;br</li>

<li> Much smaller container and hard to get in and out.</li>
<li> I say this because I&#x27;ve heard on other products like this that people complained about receiving the packae and the stones were all out of place and so forth, which made me a little scared to buy it.</li>
<li> At least in my opinion.</li>
<li> I think this advertisement is a little false!</li>
<li> They are also a bit concave at the base so they stay on a lot longer than the gems with the flat bottoms.</li>
<li> I received the wrong product.</li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t answer my question, didn&#x27;t acknowledge sending me the wrong product..</li>
<li> COMPLETELY USELESS!!</li>
<li> TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> it was like 3 or maybe 4 different sizes like small medium and large but when laid out it didn&#x27;t look to be 12 different sizes</li>
    <li> you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> this is exactlly what i needed. i like to add sparkle to my manis and this does the job! has all sorts of sized :)</li>
    <li> The wheel is very neat and organized and the gems are great. They come in different sizes and there&#x27;s so many of them to use! I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever run out of them. This is definitely a must buy.</li>
    <li> Only 3 sizes here but they are pretty and the case holds the rhinestones well. I only encountered one large rhinestone that was missing the reflective back and I&#x27;ve almost used them all.</li>
    <li> I love it. It was exactly what I was looking for. The sizes are perfect and they&#x27;re a great quality. They&#x27;re not dull like most gems you&#x27;d find at this price. They are also a bit concave at the base so they stay on a lot longer than the gems with the flat bottoms.</li>
    <li> So I ordered the rhinestones and they state that it&#x27;s 12 different sizes but there actually is only 3 sizes and the containers aren&#x27;t really full. Some of the sections of the wheels are barely full. But it&#x27;s still cheap and I don&#x27;t really mind it haven&#x27;t 12 different sizes since the sizes they sent me was usuable. Not too small and not too big.</li>
    <li> Product is ok. It didn&#x27;t say how many pieces of the various sizes you get, and there are not many. The picture gave the impression that there were more than what was in the package. For the price, I guess it&#x27;s ok. They are as described, just not a lot of them..</li>
    <li> I loved these rhinestones! They arrived pretty fast. I purchased them for nail art. I applied them with a wax pencil and sealed them on with seche vite. They stayed on for 5 days. Would have lasted longer but I decided to remove them. They didn&#x27;t lose their shine either.  Perfect, very pretty. My only complain would be that there is a gap in between the top and bottom portion where the rhinestones are so they can slide out of the container.</li>
    <li> It is a lot smaller than I thought it would be. I literally bought a brand new big bag to keep this and four other wheels organized, and now I&#x27;m laughing at how unnecessary that was. I will probably lose this before I ever get a chance to use it. I was also surprised at how little jewels there are compared to the space available. That being said, I suggest taking a long hard look at this photo before making the purchase, because the closer I look at the photo, the more I&#x27;m realizing it&#x27;s not that far off, they just really don&#x27;t offer you much in the way of jewels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will still get a few uses out of this (hopefully) and the jewels are in fact different sizes (looks more like 4 than 12 different sizes to me, but what do I know). There&#x27;s just not a lot. Another bonus is I do like the way the wheel is designed. I don&#x27;t think jewels will be falling out rather than due to my own carelessness; That is to say, it&#x27;s well made.</li>
    <li> I received the product the first day it said it would arrive but I didn&#x27;t realize it would take 3 weeks for me to receive the item once I ordered it. after I received it was 12 different sizes, the biggest size isn&#x27;t very big like I thought it might be. the container is actually pretty small(about 2inch in diameter) but the rhinestones seemed all to be in the right place. still pretty content tho. hope this helps</li>
    <li> Will work for project not quite what I expected. Much smaller container and hard to get in and out. But they are for nails so if you purchase these remember to get out what you need before you start bc with nails on you won&#x27;t b able to get them out or could scratch them up.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t actually used the product as yet but it looks pretty decent. They are all the same size.</li>
    <li> These are awesome! However one thing that I didn&#x27;t like was that the different sizes were mixed!</li>
    <li> Since I got these all my girlies are asking me to do their nails for the holidays. Great product, plenty of each size. And very practical packaging.</li>
    <li> I love doing interesting nail art and these are great for adding a shimmery detail. I sometimes use them as the only accent in my manicure for just a touch of sparkle.</li>
    <li> I ordered this last week, and received it yesterday. Let me just say that none of the sizes were mixed up, and they give you a very good amount for each size (about 2/3 slots full). I say this because I&#x27;ve heard on other products like this that people complained about receiving the packae and the stones were all out of place and so forth, which made me a little scared to buy it. But that was not the case. *whew*  I can&#x27;t wait to use them. So excited!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I just noticed that the product states that it includes 12 different sizes. Be warned! There are only about 3/4 different sizes, what they did was just include a good amount of each size. But nonetheless its still good and I love it.</li>
    <li> They look really good . i did my sisters nails and she loved them . the price is right .</li>
    <li> they are ok but not crystals like I expected, more plastic with round top rather than geometric shape of rhinestones... they look like clear plastic domes</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re exactly what I ordered and what I wanted. I will tell all my Nail Tech friends about this seller. I&#x27;m extremely happy with them.</li>
    <li> I received the wrong product. I ordered these rhinestones and was sent half back plain pearls. I figured I would just keep the pearls and just order more rhinestones so I contacted the seller to let them know what happened and see if they could ensure that my next order I will reveive rhinestones and this is the E-mail I received back:::&lt;br /&gt;There are all flat back pearls,but there have different size.&lt;br /&gt; Please check it on the item list.  &amp;#60;-------- REALLY??? Thats it??? That tells me nothing! Didn&#x27;t answer my question, didn&#x27;t acknowledge sending me the wrong product.. NOTHING! COMPLETELY USELESS!! TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! I WILL NOT order from this company again!!!</li>
    <li> When i received this, it was not what i ordered or what is pictured! At first i thought i made the error when purchasing it, but looking back and looking at it now. they made the error. They were iridescent not clear, and are not faceted. Very displeased.</li>
    <li> All of my pieces were the same size.</li>
    <li> I was hopping for a few more different sizes bit this is great for price.</li>
    <li> I think this advertisement is a little false! Although they are different sized rhinestones they are a little to big for nail art! At least in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I just recieved this wheel and they are all the same&lt;br /&gt;Size super small not what i expected very disapionted</li>
    <li> Just received my rhinstones. They arrived a week earlier from its expected delivery date, which is great. Everything was in tact and very well packaged. And didn&#x27;t expect the free gift of different nail tip decals to use for different nail designs such as chevron and french tip nails, which was also great cause I&#x27;ve always wanted to try them. Can&#x27;t wait to use both the rhinstones and the nail tip decals in my future nail designs. And I will definately order from this company again in the future, especially for their great prices.</li>
    <li> This one is very nice I was thinking in other think but when they coming i was surprise</li>
    <li> I love the fact that is product has an awesomeness range in rhinestone sizes!! The range was better than i originally thought it would be. It is so convenient to have. Especially, if you don&#x27;t like to just have to one size. I&#x27;ve had this product for maybe about a month or so now and I&#x27;ve used every size.</li>
    <li> I read a review on these before I ordered saying theres is only one sizr of stones in this wheels. When I received mine there were in fact all different sizes of round rhinestones.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t even get the right order of rhinestones!!..smh...</li>
    <li> love it, but I though they were for nails, but they&#x27;re too big.</li>
