### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Sanyo is the best battery!</li>
      <li>Nothing is perfect and defects do make it through quality control.  </li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>Operating as great as it did 12 years ago.</li>
      <li>If you feel handy, buy the cheapest soldering iron (the smallest is the best)</li>
      <li>Perfect fit and works</li>
      <li>These folks don&#x27;t believe in good customer service.  </li>
      <li>These fit my razor perfectly.</li>
      <li>There were some good pictures online that helped me through the process.</li>
      <li>Come on, you know you&#x27;re not being honest</li>
      <li>I guess I&#x27;ll be growing a beard until I get good batteries from a better, more reputable company.  </li>
      <li>okay.  </li>
      <li>I have used this battery pack as a replacement every time, and have had outstanding performance from them every time.</li>
      <li>thanks it worked out great...</li>
      <li>Perfect fit, still charging, expect long life use.</li>
      <li>Easy to replace.</li>
      <li>They didn&#x27;t solder in as easily as I hoped</li>
      <li>I got it as a gift 20 years ago and it is still going strong.</li>
      <li>Quickly received!</li>
      <li>The batteries came on time, were the correct ones and fit just fine</li>
      <li>and you are being cheap.  </li>
      <li>recommand these to anyone with a Norelco shaver that these fit.</li>
      <li>This set of batteries works like the original batteries and it kept me from throwing away a perfectly good 15 year old Norelco electric shaver.</li>
      <li>I have two identical vintage Norelco Cool Skin units.  </li>
      <li>100000 battery installs and never a bad one?  </li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;homemade&amp;#34; assembly is much more potent, which could be due to higher capacity batteries, and is another reason to source your own batteries.  </li>
      <li>My Norelco electric razor chargers like when I first got it.</li>
      <li>many years (various Norelco units) was using rechargeable batteries on hand to replace factory batteries.  </li>
      <li>The batteries fit however the old batteries were welded in by a spot weld so that had to be disconnected</li>
      <li>Replacement was easy enough.</li>
      <li>Anyway, Brian and I argued back and forth over the course of several e-mails and an honest company, for such a cheap part would have just sent me another set</li>
      <li>Modern batteries have a zero defect rate.  </li>
      <li>Did the job to save purchasing a whole new shaver!  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s much cheaper than buying a new one.</li>
      <li>My time is more valuable than to mess around with going to the post office, paying return shipping and then waiting for him to test them</li>
      <li>The reason I was replacing the batteries was because several years old and not holding a full charge anymore.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a lot cheaper than getting a new razor.</li>
      <li>This battery pack revived my shaver to like new after 4 years.</li>
      <li>and this is a direct quote from his email to me &amp;#34;I&#x27;m sorry that you have experienced a problem.  </li>
      <li>Charge time is 35 min down from the original 45 min when the shaver was new</li>
      <li>but I can&#x27;t get the old batteries out to get the new ones</li>
      <li>batteries and with limited success.</li>
      <li>The solder doesn&#x27;t really stay solid when attempting to solder the shaver connection directly to the battery terminals.</li>
      <li>I have an old Norelco 955rx razor.</li>
      <li>I have been repairing shavers for nearly 20 years and have never seen a defective battery with over 100000 installed.&amp;#34;  </li>
      <li>The battery pack Norelco is now sluggish and exhibits less shave time after a full recharge.  </li>
      <li>Six months ago  I installed a new battery pack in one unit and two batteries (higher output) from inventory in the other Norelco.  </li>
      <li>I monkeyed around with using regular old 1.2 V rechargeable (sp?)</li>
      <li>I put my old batteries back in and the shaver charged and worked</li>
      <li>experience is consistent with other comments regarding &amp;#34;suspect quality and shelf life&amp;#34;  of these battery packs, along with potentially troublesome spot welds.  </li>
      <li>This battery does not last as long as a new battery between charges.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Definitely need to have a soldering iron/solder and lots of patience. There were some good pictures online that helped me through the process. My Norelco electric razor chargers like when I first got it. Great product!</li>
    <li> Sanyo is the best battery!</li>
    <li> Easy to replace. Operating as great as it did 12 years ago.</li>
    <li> This battery pack revived my shaver to like new after 4 years. Norelco will not sell them to you but, these are a match to the OEM pack.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommand these to anyone with a Norelco shaver that these fit.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not that the batteries aren&#x27;t any good--probably they are--but I can&#x27;t get the old batteries out to get the new ones in!&lt;br /&gt;Do I need to go to a jeweler?</li>
    <li> This battery does not last as long as a new battery between charges.  The battery may have been sitting on the shelf for too long and lost some of its capability.</li>
    <li> They didn&#x27;t solder in as easily as I hoped but I shouldn&#x27;t have taken off the tabs. The solder doesn&#x27;t really stay solid when attempting to solder the shaver connection directly to the battery terminals. I made it work eventually though. Charge time is 35 min down from the original 45 min when the shaver was new but it&#x27;s much cheaper than buying a new one.</li>
    <li> Did the job to save purchasing a whole new shaver!  Quickly received!</li>
    <li> I was sent a different brand of batteries and I am already having problems with them holding a charge. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!</li>
    <li> These are what you expect when you need AA size NiCad batteries.  Already having them with tab attached helped install them.</li>
    <li> thanks it worked out great...I&#x27;ll be back</li>
    <li> Rant On.  The batteries came on time, were the correct ones and fit just fine but they were bad right out of the package.  They wouldn&#x27;t accept a charge even though the indicator on the charger indicated they were charged.  I suspect that they had been sitting on the shelf for a while or were just plain bad.  It isn&#x27;t unheard of and it does happen.  I checked the connections and even tried to charge the razor a second time but when put under the load of the shaver motor, the motor would attempt to turn but stop immediately.  I put my old batteries back in and the shaver charged and worked okay.  The reason I was replacing the batteries was because several years old and not holding a full charge anymore.  Anyway, I contacted ShaverOutlet and told them of the problem.  The person I corresponded with was Brian and in his words and this is a direct quote from his email to me &amp;#34;I&#x27;m sorry that you have experienced a problem.  Modern batteries have a zero defect rate.  I have been repairing shavers for nearly 20 years and have never seen a defective battery with over 100000 installed.&amp;#34;  Brian...what you said is factually wrong and dishonest.  Nothing is perfect and defects do make it through quality control.  100000 battery installs and never a bad one?  Come on, you know you&#x27;re not being honest and you are being cheap.  Anyway, Brian and I argued back and forth over the course of several e-mails and an honest company, for such a cheap part would have just sent me another set but no.  Brian wanted me to send the $7 + $5 S&amp;H batteries back so that he could &amp;#34;test them&amp;#34;.  My time is more valuable than to mess around with going to the post office, paying return shipping and then waiting for him to test them so I could prove my point to him.  All over $13.  I&#x27;m simply going to take my future business somewhere else.  Brian, I hope ShaverDepot spends the $13 you made off of me well.  Folks, do yourself a favor and go somewhere else for your shaver/battery needs.These folks don&#x27;t believe in good customer service.  All this over a lousy $13.  What a hassle.  I guess I&#x27;ll be growing a beard until I get good batteries from a better, more reputable company.  Rant Off</li>
    <li> I monkeyed around with using regular old 1.2 V rechargeable (sp?) batteries and with limited success. This set of batteries works like the original batteries and it kept me from throwing away a perfectly good 15 year old Norelco electric shaver. The screws holding the shaver together may give you trouble though. I am not sure if they are torques head or a slanted angled kinda star head...use to have a multi-set removal tool for those but couldn&#x27;t find them so, used a torque head long screw driver which worked but just barely. Once out I opted not to put the screws back in yet, but just used a big rubber band to help hold the razor together.</li>
    <li> Seeing the photos is one thing.  Removing the old batteries requires unsoldering and re-soldering in some very tight, small space.  NOT just a simple replacement.</li>
    <li> These fit my razor perfectly. Replacement was easy enough. Soldering gun required. My only complaint is that they seem to run down a lot quicker than the original ones did.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit and works</li>
    <li> The batteries fit however the old batteries were welded in by a spot weld so that had to be disconnected and then I had to solder them in because I have no spot welder. It should have been in the description that this would be necessary to replace the batteries.&lt;br /&gt;Many people will not have the skill or tools to do the replacement.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit, still charging, expect long life use.</li>
    <li> I have two identical vintage Norelco Cool Skin units.  Prior to ordering one of these packs my standard procedure&lt;br /&gt;for many years (various Norelco units) was using rechargeable batteries on hand to replace factory batteries.  Six months ago  I installed a new battery pack in one unit and two batteries (higher output) from inventory in the other Norelco.  The battery pack Norelco is now sluggish and exhibits less shave time after a full recharge.  The &amp;#34;homemade&amp;#34; assembly is much more potent, which could be due to higher capacity batteries, and is another reason to source your own batteries.  My replacement batteries were Duracell 2450mAh. HR6/DC1500 NiHH  1.2V/2450.  Same cost as battery pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience is consistent with other comments regarding &amp;#34;suspect quality and shelf life&amp;#34;  of these battery packs, along with potentially troublesome spot welds.  I didn&#x27;t find these assembled units any easier to install and have serious doubts about quality and longevity.  My homemade installations use a paper clip wire instead of metal band for terminal connections.  All factors considered I will not be compelled to order  another battery pack.</li>
    <li> I have an old Norelco 955rx razor. I got it as a gift 20 years ago and it is still going strong. However, the batteries do need to be replaced every 5-6 years. I have used this battery pack as a replacement every time, and have had outstanding performance from them every time. If you don&#x27;t know the difference between a pair of channel locks and a crescent wrench, you may want to take the battery pack and razor to any number of electronic repair shops and they will solder it in for you for around 15 dollars. It&#x27;s a lot cheaper than getting a new razor. If you feel handy, buy the cheapest soldering iron (the smallest is the best) you can find and have a go at it. It really isn&#x27;t that hard to do. Also, see if you can find someone who has a spool of small diameter solder. About 2 inches will last you a lifetime. I like my razor and will probably be changing out the batteries for another twenty years.</li>
