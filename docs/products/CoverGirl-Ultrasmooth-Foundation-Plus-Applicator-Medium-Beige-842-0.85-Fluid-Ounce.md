      <li>but I still noticed with the silicone applicator it wasn&#x27;t going as smooth as I had expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Although I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes, I would truly go out and buy this foundation again!</li>

      <li>I was really excited to receive this produce from influenster to try</li>
      <li>I liked the foundation itself because its smooth and it doesn&#x27;t have that foundation smell and its really soft.</li>
      <li>It comes with this special applicator unlike anything I had seen before.</li>
      <li>I got this to review and was super excited</li>
      <li>I personally like the foundation it has good coverage but without using the rubber thing that didn&#x27;t work at all, could of done without it</li>
      <li>I have really fallen in love with this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m always looking for a good foundation, especially since the one I&#x27;d been using was discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Color true to promise.  </li>
      <li>I like a matte makeup, and can add this with my Urban Decay Naked foundation and get a great look!</li>
      <li>first it is light coverage but can def be built to medium coverage</li>
      <li>Pretty Smooth like the name..</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I said it was easy to apply because the foundation itself is easy to apply, allthe foundation transfer completely from the applicator to my skin.</li>
      <li>It says that it is hair smoothing, and I think that it really does help reduce the appearance of fine hairs on your face.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for everyday wear.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I got this product for free to test and really like it.</li>
      <li>but once I have it on, it doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy which is amazing :)</li>
      <li>It is very buildable and creates a smooth face.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I received the product free thanks to Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
      <li>received this complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
      <li>I think the point of the applicator was to reduce the amount of product that is absorbed by the blending sponge</li>
      <li>I would prefer to use a foundation brush or sponge applicator for a lighter, more natural feel.</li>
      <li>I received this product in a voxbox complimentary for testing purposes.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how I&#x27;d be able to apply the foundation with the pink tool included</li>
      <li>Leave skin super smooth and has a natural look.</li>
      <li>The small peach fuzzy hairs were greatly minimized with this product.</li>
      <li>It says on the bottle that it helps minimize the look of fine facial hair and to smooth over the foundation in the direction of hair growth</li>
      <li>There were no weird lines from application.</li>
      <li>It is the first liquid foundation that I have used.</li>
      <li>I would much prefer just using my sponge (or even fingers!)</li>
      <li>I will absolutely be purchasing this product again soon!</li>
      <li>I tried this foundation thanks to Influenster, received it complimentary for testing purposes.</li>
      <li>While the applicator may seem unusual at first, it does a good job at blending the makeup so that you can cover dark spots and blemished easier.</li>
      <li>I now have more patience with the applicator after several times of using it, and now I really like the concept of the applicator</li>
      <li>it stayed on well and left my face feeling clean!</li>
      <li>The product is also supposed to smooth down fine hair on the face, but in this respect I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I got this product for free to test and really like it. Goes on easily and smoothly. I love the applicator that it comes with.</li>
    <li> I got this product fir testing purposes and was pretty impressed! At first I was confused but the flimsy looking oval shaped disc applicator it came with but I gave it a try. It was strange using it but worked really well and gave a really smooth finish. The foundation it self was great too. It went on well and wasn&#x27;t oily or wet it stayed on well and left my face feeling clean! I liked this product and the color was perfect too!</li>
    <li> Pretty Smooth like the name..&lt;br /&gt;At first it is light coverage but can def be built to medium coverage&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just don&#x27;t like the applicator..I would use fingers / beauty blender&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;on the oily side on nose but still good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check my youtube video:&lt;br /&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;DbRTJAVcX-k</li>
    <li> I received this product to review from Influenster. I like the idea of this product but it didn&#x27;t work out the way I was hoping. I didn&#x27;t see where it was any more smoothing than my other foundations. Plus it has a really tacky formula that I could feel the whole time I was wearing it. That was weird to me since I loveeeee pretty much all the Covergirl foundations and never had that problem before. I think it has to do with it being an Olay + Covergirl product. Also the applicator is awful. I would much prefer just using my sponge (or even fingers!) over it. To each their own but this really didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I received this product in a voxbox complimentary for testing purposes. The color of this foundation didn&#x27;t match my face at all so my review is based solely on the actual product. It was alright. The little applicator was terrible though and was really hard to apply the make up with. I didn&#x27;t notice much difference with my facial hair (as I don&#x27;t have much). It&#x27;s an alright product but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product. The color was true and a great match. I wasn&#x27;t sure how I&#x27;d be able to apply the foundation with the pink tool included but once I applied it- it just glided on! Leave skin super smooth and has a natural look. It&#x27;s not cakey or heavy. I am very happy with this product. It&#x27;s great for everyday wear.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars because it has medium coverage. I do a lot of on camera work and cannot rely on medium coverage foundation for that. However, this foundation is perfect for daily wear.</li>
    <li> I received this foundation from influenster for testing purposes. I found that the foundation itself when using the applicator was cakey and too thick for my taste. I could feel it for the short period of time I wore it. The applicator was also hard to use. I would prefer to use a foundation brush or sponge applicator for a lighter, more natural feel. I do think it covers blemishes and dark spots well! This color was a little too dark for my skin tone, but not by much. I have small natural facial hairs and I didn’t notice much of a difference between this foundation and the one I am currently using.</li>
    <li> I was very excited and intrigued by this product after receiving it from Influenster to test and review. Unfortunately, it did not really live up to my expectations. For a $13-15 foundation I expected a lot more. Though the product itself is decent, the applicator it comes with does not evenly apply the make up and I had to resort to using additional make up brushes and foam applicators. The color and stay is decent, but doesn&#x27;t really last with oily skin. It&#x27;s supposed to help with fine hair, but I did not see a difference. Smell is okay and it didn&#x27;t make my skin break out.</li>
    <li> I received COVERGIRL ‪#‎UltraSmooth‬ Foundation for FREE from Influenster! I loved the product. It provided great coverage on my acne prone skin. There was no waste with the given applicator. It worked best when I dapped the foundation on my skin instead of wiping it. ‪#‎RefreshVoxBox‬</li>
    <li> I received this product for review from influenster, though all my opinions are my own. I got this to review and was super excited but my excitement was soon replaced by disappointment. First of all the applicator, seriously who came up with this thing? I tried to use it i really did but it kept sticking to my skin. It was like trying to rub dry plastic across my face not my favorite feeling :( The foundation isn&#x27;t to terrible but, not the greatest coverage and the color i received was a little to dark for my skin. I also didn&#x27;t like the smell of the product either. So overall I wasn&#x27;t into this product at all.</li>
    <li> I have been using the CoverGirl Ultra Smooth Foundation for several weeks now. Let me begin with the basics, its a small bottle about 25 ml but a little goes a long as I learned that from first applying it. It comes with this special applicator unlike anything I had seen before. Its an oval shape silicone applicator. Its similar to some facial scrub brushes, but this one was smooth with a middle bump in the middle of it. Its purpose, I don&#x27;t know. The applicator is pretty soft to the touch and the foundation goes on directly on to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked the color from an online option so I was guessing which color was best suited for my skin. I picked the Medium Beige but when I received it, it was a tad too dark for my skin. Its okay though I still used it because it wasn&#x27;t that off. I put some on the applicator and began to apply it on my cheek where I had some scarring. I noticed that the applicator was leaving some streaks and I kept smoothing it until they were gone. It took quite a bit of smoothing before they disappeared. I had put too much foundation on the applicator. I put less the next time but I still noticed with the silicone applicator it wasn&#x27;t going as smooth as I had expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After that I used my makeup brushes and liked how it went on better with the brushes. It covered some of the dark scarring I have which are not that bad. I however did noticed it wasn&#x27;t a total coverage. It says on the bottle that it helps minimize the look of fine facial hair and to smooth over the foundation in the direction of hair growth and I did. Its not an issue for me if that peach hair is noticeable but maybe for others it is. I liked the foundation itself because its smooth and it doesn&#x27;t have that foundation smell and its really soft. I didn&#x27;t like the applicator much though. Maybe its due to my combination skin; I am not sure but on my face it didn&#x27;t go as smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I said it was easy to apply because the foundation itself is easy to apply, allthe foundation transfer completely from the applicator to my skin. No foundation went to waste. After applying in the morning I noticed late afternoon that it looked like I needed to reapply or &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; the foundation. It didn&#x27;t cause me irritation so far but I have had dry skin due to illness so I haven&#x27;t used it on a daily basis. I alternate with this foundation and my powder one. I received this foundation complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes but the opinions are entirely my own .</li>
    <li> I received CoverGirl Ultrasmooth Foundation to try out free from Influenster.It is the first liquid foundation that I have used. I have sensitive skin and it does not irritate it which is a big plus for me. I think it does reduce the look of facial hair which is great if you are looking for a product that can do that. The applicator is weird, but I have used it a few times and you get use to it over a blender. I think the point of the applicator was to reduce the amount of product that is absorbed by the blending sponge and I think it does that. However, the applicator is difficult to use in smaller spaces like around the nose. The coverage is medium and it does require some reapplication. All in all, I thought it was a good product but the applicator needs some work.</li>
    <li> I received my CoverGirl ‪#‎UltraSmooth‬ foundation last week in my Refresh VoxBox. As a Mary Kay user, I was skeptical, but I loved this product. It had just enough coverage for me, but was smooth, thin, light and airy. I will absolutely be purchasing this product again soon! The applicator glides over skin smoothly, without any pulling or tugging.  The coverage is great, smooth and completely flawless.  I love this product!</li>
    <li> I am literally in love with this foundation! I actually got this free from my Influenster Refresh VoxBox. It perfectly matched my skin tone and it applied smoothly. The consistency is a bit more thick than I would like but once I have it on, it doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy which is amazing :)</li>
    <li> I received CoverGirl Ultrasmooth Foundation to try out free from Influenster. What I liked best about this product is that it is a long-lasting foundation and can be applied very smoothly to the face. I also like that this comes with an applicator for a smoother process. While the applicator may seem unusual at first, it does a good job at blending the makeup so that you can cover dark spots and blemished easier. The product is also supposed to smooth down fine hair on the face, but in this respect I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference. Overall, this is a product I would definitely want to keep using.</li>
    <li> I tried this foundation thanks to Influenster, received it complimentary for testing purposes. I like it. It is light to medium coverage. Wish that my pores didn&#x27;t pop out with this foundation other than that I really like it.I The only problem I had was my pores popped out with this foundation but it also depends on the primer I use under it. Overall I would definitely recommend it to people, if you have very visible pores just make sure you use a good primer.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear foundation very often, as I always feel it looks unnatural on me. I received a sample of this stuff, and I was really impressed. It blended well and was long lasting. I did find the applicator that came with it to be useless, and ended up using my fingers for application.</li>
    <li> I recieved this product in my Influsenster RefreshVoxBox and I liked the way the foundation felt on my face. The coverage was good and easily buildable. However, I really do not like the applicator. It makes the makeup go on streaky.</li>
    <li> I have really fallen in love with this product. I got it in my Influenster Voxbox to test out and I was a little worried that the color and applicator would not work right or look right. The applicator does take a bit of getting used to but it does apply the product nicely and really blends it in well. There were no weird lines from application. The small peach fuzzy hairs were greatly minimized with this product. The color was perfect acutally and I am naturally a light olive color. It did not feel cakey or greasy. I have been using it just about every day since trying it!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome.  The applicator took a bit to get used to, but now I love it.  No more foundation fingers from applying my makeup.  Coverage was full, but light weight.  Color true to promise.  I received a sample bottle from Influenster, but all opinions shared are my own.</li>
    <li> I am usually pretty skeptical when it comes to liquid foundations, especially grocery or drug store foundations, but I gotta say, I am VERY impressed with CoverGirl&#x27;s Ultrasmooth Foundation! I barely notice I&#x27;m wearing it except when I look in the mirror and see even skin tone with blemishes hidden away looking completely natural. Medium beige is perfect for my skin, it looks like mineral make up, comparable to Bare Escentuals. Although I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes, I would truly go out and buy this foundation again!</li>
    <li> So I received this #UltraSmoothFoundation from influenster for free for testing and review purposes In my #Refreshvoxbox. I personally like the foundation it has good coverage but without using the rubber thing that didn&#x27;t work at all, could of done without it it doesn&#x27;t blend well the foundation is really creamy doesn&#x27;t leave that cake heavy feeling on your face. #contest</li>
    <li> I have tried the foundation multiple times since I received it for testing and reviewing purposes, and at first trying to use applicator was difficult. I think if there was a little handle on the applicator it would make a huge difference in applying the foundation, and the time it takes because at first I would get frustrated and end up using my beauty blender to finish my makeup. I now have more patience with the applicator after several times of using it, and now I really like the concept of the applicator and I like the results it gives my skin. I will be getting another color because the one I received was a shade too light, but I make it work with bronzer.</li>
    <li> I received CoverGirl Ultrasmooth Foundation to try out free from Influenster. I have sensitive skin and it does not irritate it which is a big plus for me.  The applicator is weird, but I have used it a few times and got use to it. However, the applicator is difficult to use in smaller spaces like around the nose. The coverage is descent but it does require some reapplication throughout the day. Overall this product met my needs, but I would like to see a revised applicator in future foundations</li>
    <li> This foundation works great! It&#x27;s medium to full coverage and its buildable! I have sensitive skin and the foundation did not irritate it at all! I received the product for testing purposes and fell in love with it! The hairs along the side of my face were no longer visible! It gave a nice smooth flawless finish. I also like that even though its full coverage it does not feel heavy on my skin. I recommend this product to anyone! Even if hair is not a problem, definitely give this product a try!</li>
    <li> I received the product free thanks to Influenster for testing purposes. I like the product, and it is buildable. I am not a big fan of the applicator, it just kinda smears the makeup around and makes a bit of a mess. I used the product on its own and it gives great coverage. I have pigmentation on my skin, and it does a great job covering it. I like a matte makeup, and can add this with my Urban Decay Naked foundation and get a great look! I received this product for free, but the opinions are of my own.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to receive this produce from influenster to try but I&#x27;m not sold on the applicator.  Overall the coverage was good and fairly lightweight but not the best foundation.  All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I was thrilled to get the opportunity to try this product for free thanks to Influenster (but my opinions are entirely my own.) I&#x27;m always looking for a good foundation, especially since the one I&#x27;d been using was discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the foundation itself. It gave light coverage and is smooth but I did have to build up on some of my problem spots I also had to reapply during the day at times. The color matched my skin tone so I was happy with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the applicator was useless. It was just a piece of plastic. The point is supposed to be to &amp;#34;tame&amp;#34; your facial hairs, but I didn&#x27;t see how using the applicator did anything at all to fix my facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Nice color, light coverage&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: May need to build, applicator is useless</li>
    <li> The color was perfect for my skin.  It says that it is hair smoothing, and I think that it really does help reduce the appearance of fine hairs on your face.  As for the applicator I did not care for it at all.  I tried using it, but I did not like the way that it moved the product around.  I am very happy with the foundation itself.  It is very buildable and creates a smooth face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
