      <li>You&#x27;ll have a light, shiny finish.</li>
      <li>The product is original.. . . .</li>
      <li>As we all know, these huge sizes are the only good value for Kerastase products</li>

      <li>My super-fine, straight hair looks unwashed within two days.</li>
      <li>but I like the scent and conditioning features of Lait Vital much better and will not be ordering this again for my dry hair.</li>
      <li>Crystalliste Cristal is probably a great line from Kerastase, just not ideal for my hair type.</li>
      <li>I have dry, fine, frizzy hair.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair very soft!</li>
      <li>Although I love Kerastase in general, this shampoo just was not right for my hair type.</li>
      <li>In fact, the first three ingredients are the same.</li>
      <li>These make my hair shinny all the time and these are professional use.</li>

<li> /&gt;Nothing wrong with this conditioner</li>
<li> My scalp itches really bad after using this to the point that I was scratching my head so bad it bleed.</li>

    <li> Although I love Kerastase in general, this shampoo just was not right for my hair type. I have very, very fine, naturally wavy-slightly curly hair, and lots of it! Can easily go two to three days without washing it. However this shampoo and rinse (bought both) seemed to weigh my hair down and make it look greasy! Not for me but it smelt great. I ended up using all of it over time but invested in the Kerastase Resistance line of shampoo&#x27;s and rinses (green bottle). Crystalliste Cristal is probably a great line from Kerastase, just not ideal for my hair type. The smell was really nice though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Kerastase products for over 3 years now and I love them!&lt;br /&gt;It makes my hair feel so healthy! I would recommend this product 100%.</li>
    <li> I have very long Asian, semi-thick hair and this conditioner is perfect! I bought this with the shampoo. Leaves my hair very soft!</li>
    <li> I love Kerastase&#x27;s products. I use both shampoo and conditioner. These make my hair shinny all the time and these are professional use.</li>
    <li> Perfect! I loved this product! I didnt have any problem with this order. The product is original.. . . .</li>
    <li> I love this product! My super-fine, straight hair looks unwashed within two days. Also, I am sensitive to sulfates/sulfites/whatever can cause scalp to itch, and have had rashes from other products. Not so with this one!</li>
    <li> Left my Hair feeling dry and brittle, won&#x27;t be  buying it again.</li>
    <li> This does a great job of conditioning dry, fine hair without making it flat.  I have dry, fine, frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> This light conditioner is perfect for long hair. Great for thick hair as well. Does not feel heavy. Nice fragrance too.</li>
    <li> As we all know, these huge sizes are the only good value for Kerastase products and I like having access to the salon size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing wrong with this conditioner but I like the scent and conditioning features of Lait Vital much better and will not be ordering this again for my dry hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Keratase products for over 8 years, I&#x27;ve never had this problem..My scalp itches really bad after using this to the point that I was scratching my head so bad it bleed. Spend the extra cash at the salon to make sure the product is legit.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I buy this conditioner. I have long thin hair and this conditioner makes my hair so shiny and with volume. It smells like cherry blossom and hydrates the ends of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it is so liquid and runny.</li>
    <li> Item was priced way cheaper than I could have purchased it at any salon, and it arrived super fast!  Thanks much!</li>
    <li> This would have been a 5star review IF I had thought I was buying SHAMPOO. But since it is listed as conditioner that&#x27;s what I thought I was buying.  NeedlesstosayShampoo doesn&#x27;t work as conditioner . . . If you want a great shampoo, buy this.  if you want conditioner, look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Use with Kerastase Cristal Bain shampoo or with other products.  This conditioner does a great job of detangling and protecting without making the hair waxy or oily.  I loved it the first time I tried it.  It is outstanding for long-fine hair. When you get hooked, buy the large 33oz bottle and save a bundle.</li>
    <li> My wife said, product  works great with shampoo.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good stuff but not worth the price tag.I don&#x27;t see any difference in my hair between this product and Suave&#x27;s version of Kerastase. In fact, the first three ingredients are the same. They make up 95% of the product.</li>
    <li> This condition hold be used with the shampoo.  It&#x27;s light, not gummy, and you should run a large toothed comb through your har before rinsing for easier handling.  You&#x27;ll have a light, shiny finish.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, makes hair shiny!</li>
