      <li>This scrub is the best facial scrub that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>

      <li>100% vegetarian ingredients, no parabens or animal testing, love this product</li>
      <li>I am sure this would be great for a drier or normal skin, but not optimal for an oilier skin.</li>

      <li>smells amazing, really cleanses face easily, love it.</li>
      <li>This product is amazing, very gentle on your skin and feels refreshed after every use.</li>
      <li>Its more money than i would normally spend 10.00 each but honestly one day of use</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried St Ives, and the smells aren&#x27;t really natural and pleasant.  </li>
      <li>Scrubbing particles are so huge that there is no way to scrub without scratching the face.</li>
      <li>I pair this with the Alba Botanica toner to minimize pores and their oil free moisturizer to hydrate my skin, making it appear flawless.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I like that it is organic and doesn&#x27;t contain harmful chemicals or parabens, and it has a light pineapple scent.</li>
      <li>Light fragrance</li>
      <li>It leaves skin feeling very fresh and isn&#x27;t overly abrasive.</li>
      <li>Alba&#x27;s Pineapple Enzyme Facial Scrub is deliciously pineapple with hints of orange juice and dreams of coconut drinks on beaches somewhere very far from home.</li>
      <li>Not sure if this will be the best choice for the summer.  </li>
      <li>The face doesn&#x27;t feel clean and polished after i use this scrub.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too abrasive, made from organic ingredients, and keeps my face clean.</li>
      <li>I use this scrub in the shower to clean my face.  </li>
      <li>Purifying Pineapple Enzyme Facial Scrub that it would be a good option for my skin.</li>
      <li>I bought this face scrub thinking it would be a mild cleanser to take off my make-up and wash my face at night/morning.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many facial scrubs over the years,  most consisting of sugar or salt crystals.  </li>
      <li>I originally went in hunt of the Freeman Pineapple Enzyme mask but after visiting a number of grocery, convenience and beauty product specialty stores I gave up and just went for the first thing that had pineapple enzyme in it.</li>
      <li>The scrubbing particles kind of stick to your face (especially in eyebrows)</li>
      <li>Other scrubs with any grit to them aggrevate my fair skin but not this one.</li>
      <li>I went to Target to verify that this didn&#x27;t smell right and noticed that Alba has changed the packaging.</li>
      <li>I seen and I felt results right away.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great scrub that doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling like it&#x27;s been rubbed raw.  </li>
      <li>It is however a nice option for use in the winter time when my face starts to get chapped and has patches of dry skin.</li>
      <li>now that&#x27;s a dedicated customer  ;-)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d love to see this in a larger container!</li>
      <li>Short and sweet - my favorite face scrub so far!  </li>
      <li>I love it, just wish it had a smaller price tag or a gift set to get all pieces at a much discounted price.</li>
      <li>The scrubbing granules are pretty large, but they didn&#x27;t scratch my face much...</li>
      <li>The exfoliating granules are very mild and the aloe makes this extra soothing.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t exfoliate as much as I like.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy this facial scrub.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle on the skin, but gets the job done.  </li>
      <li>My face feels soft, calm, noticeably exfoliated.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
      <li>I have had great luck with other products I have used from this line, but this one was not what I expected.</li>
      <li>you know like get the whole set (5 items mask, moisturizer, cleanser, toner and scrub) for 35.00 pretty much buy five get one free and one at half price.</li>
      <li>It seems like the scrubbing bits dissappear/dissolve quickly, so you are left with the enzyme on your face.  </li>
      <li>However, this face scrub is so mild that I have to use a second cleanser</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I have SUPER sensitive skin and this is the only thing I can use that doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out!</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m assuming that the product sold to me via Amazon is old/expired and sold at such a cheap price because this packaging is no longer current.</li>
      <li>I have  very sensitive skin and the Alba Hawaiian&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for some time and this is DEFINITELY NOT the same quality as the original product by Alba.</li>
      <li>My face feels clean when I finish, but not super scrubbed.  </li>
      <li>Not harsh on my skin.</li>
      <li>and this is gentle enough for me.</li>
      <li>The Alba skin care product line is very satisfactory when used properly.</li>
      <li>but once I rinsed it off I immediately noticed how soft my face was and</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>It has not  not dried my face.</li>
      <li>I like this as a natural cleanser.  </li>
      <li>Gentle enough that I can use it almost every day.</li>
      <li>Works good but unfortunately for me, it broke me out in a rash however for my daughter</li>
      <li>I feel that it is a very gentle scrub, and I&#x27;m not sure it is a scrub so much as an enzyme cleaner.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love most vegetarian and cruelty free products.  This nifty scrub will even out your skin tone but only if you use it religiously twice per day (morning and before bed).  You also need to make sure you moisturize after scrubbing.  The only reason why I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is because it&#x27;s a little difficult to fully rinse away.  The scrubbing particles kind of stick to your face (especially in eyebrows) so your morning and bedtime routines will take a little longer.</li>
    <li> This scrub is the best facial scrub that I&#x27;ve ever used. It contains little granules but they are not scratchy and overly abrasive. Other scrubs with any grit to them aggrevate my fair skin but not this one. It does a better job than high-end exfoliants at 4X the price. Gentle enough that I can use it almost every day. I found it at the health food store here and was literally driving across town to get it, and buying *two* bottles at a time so I wouldn&#x27;t run out. I&#x27;d love to see this in a larger container! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Excellent and gentle product!</li>
    <li> Alba&#x27;s Pineapple Enzyme Facial Scrub is deliciously pineapple with hints of orange juice and dreams of coconut drinks on beaches somewhere very far from home. The tropical escape factor is very present all while the scrub works overtime to remove dull surface cells. Lavender, Aloe, Jojoba, Pineapple, Papaya, Awapuhi, Bromelain and Vitamin E are the base for this creamy cleanser enhanced with a botanical fragrance. The exfoliating granules are very mild and the aloe makes this extra soothing. After one use you can see results in tone/texture and moisture balance, after three uses, you may find yourself ordering a second tube. It is that impressive. Looking forward to trying the travel kit because the products have amazing summery scents that remind me of warm days at the beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
    <li> I have been using this facial scrub for years and I love it.  It smells really good and it cleanses really well.  I started buying it on Amazon because it costs less than buying it at my local health food store.</li>
    <li> I use this scrub in the shower to clean my face.  I feel that it is a very gentle scrub, and I&#x27;m not sure it is a scrub so much as an enzyme cleaner.  It seems like the scrubbing bits dissappear/dissolve quickly, so you are left with the enzyme on your face.  My face feels clean when I finish, but not super scrubbed.  I like the low price and I do use the product regularly, but I probably won&#x27;t get it again.</li>
    <li> This is a nice product if you dont have oily skin or for winter time use. As it is a creamy face scrub, it leaves my face a bit too filmy, as I already have combination skin. It is however a nice option for use in the winter time when my face starts to get chapped and has patches of dry skin.</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful! Within two weeks a majority of my acne scars were gone. It leaves skin feeling very fresh and isn&#x27;t overly abrasive.</li>
    <li> This scurb is used by a woman that has her own creative youtube channel called &amp;#34;Sunkissalba&amp;#34;! This is the best gentle exfoliater:) You can use it everyday as gentle as it is!</li>
    <li> I have SUPER sensitive skin and this is the only thing I can use that doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out! smells great!</li>
    <li> Love this product --makes my skin smooth and bright. I have sensitive skin and this is gentle enough for me.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical because it didn&#x27;t really feel like it was scrubbing my face but once I rinsed it off I immediately noticed how soft my face was and my skin had this glow to it. And it smells great! I went ahead and got the cleanser and toner too.</li>
    <li> Short and sweet - my favorite face scrub so far!  Smells wonderful.  I will continue to purchase -- love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m usually big fan of Alba Organics brand but this scrub is a waste of money. Scrubbing particles are so huge that there is no way to scrub without scratching the face. My skin is not sensitive at all and I can tolerate any torture on my face. But this scrub ruined the reputation of scrubs for me. I switched to peeling gels. 2 stars are just for organic components.</li>
    <li> It smells nice and is enjoyable to use. I don&#x27;t know that it does anything more spectacular for my face than another scrub would, but I enjoy it anyway.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t feel exfoliated with a lot of scrubs but this... Oh my gosh. I love it. A little goes a long way so all I use is a little bit on damp skin. I seen and I felt results right away.</li>
    <li> I love this scrub. I once mistakenly ordered the non-tropical version from Alba (which looks very similar in packaging) - that one has NO perfume, but it has an awful plastic smell, like the smell of the tube or something. Still trying to use that one up. Now I make sure to get the tropical version. It&#x27;s a wonderful scent that wakes you up in the winter.</li>
    <li> I like this as a natural cleanser.  It smells great, scrubs well and leaves my face feeling clean.  My biggest complaint with this product is the packaging.  It didn&#x27;t come sealed in any way and the outside of the bottle was pretty dirty - not what you like to see in a brand new product.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product. Didn&#x27;t exfoliate as much as I like.</li>
    <li> I have tried many facial scrubs over the years,  most consisting of sugar or salt crystals.  Many have scratched&lt;br /&gt;my  face to the point where I have to wait 2 -3 days to heal up.  I have  very sensitive skin and the Alba Hawaiian&lt;br /&gt;Facial Scrub with Pineapple Enzyme does the job beautifully.  My face feels soft, calm, noticeably exfoliated.&lt;br /&gt;Good for me.</li>
    <li> i didn&#x27;t like it at all. i&#x27;ve used all kinds of facial scrubs and this is not my fav.  2 things: its way to coarse to be a facial scrub and second it leaves skin oily. The face doesn&#x27;t feel clean and polished after i use this scrub. Its a no go for me.</li>
    <li> The item I received was either expired or fake. Packaging was different, quality of the scrub and scent of product was strange as well. I&#x27;ve been using this for some time and this is DEFINITELY NOT the same quality as the original product by Alba.</li>
    <li> Nothing fantastic, could probably use any other facial scrub from the grocery store and have the same results.</li>
    <li> I just bought this, the cleanser and the toner from target the other day (buy 3 save five bucks) I originally went in hunt of the Freeman Pineapple Enzyme mask but after visiting a number of grocery, convenience and beauty product specialty stores I gave up and just went for the first thing that had pineapple enzyme in it. Its more money than i would normally spend 10.00 each but honestly one day of use and I already could see a result as could my co-workers. My skin looks brighter and feels softer. I love it, just wish it had a smaller price tag or a gift set to get all pieces at a much discounted price. you know like get the whole set (5 items mask, moisturizer, cleanser, toner and scrub) for 35.00 pretty much buy five get one free and one at half price. Seriously, though if you can afford it i suggest it.</li>
    <li> I bought this face scrub thinking it would be a mild cleanser to take off my make-up and wash my face at night/morning.  However, this face scrub is so mild that I have to use a second cleanser if I am wearing make-up.  I wear make-up as natural as possible so it isn&#x27;t caked on but after washing my face with the face scrub I can still see powder foundation on my face.  I won&#x27;t be buying this product again but I feel like I have to use it up since it was so expensive.</li>
    <li> The Alba skin care product line is very satisfactory when used properly. The Alba Botanica Pineapple Enzyme Facial Scrub washes away any trace of dead skin and calms the irritated skin all at once. I pair this with the Alba Botanica toner to minimize pores and their oil free moisturizer to hydrate my skin, making it appear flawless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to any and all women looking to improve their complexion.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t like the slimy texture of this product and the slimy glaze it leaves on your face after you wash it off.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this scrub for years. The product I received smells like menthyl and lacks the fruity smell. The texture of the scurb is also different. I went to Target to verify that this didn&#x27;t smell right and noticed that Alba has changed the packaging. So I&#x27;m assuming that the product sold to me via Amazon is old/expired and sold at such a cheap price because this packaging is no longer current.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE the smell!! Not harsh on my skin. Looking forward to purchasing more from this product line.</li>
    <li> Like it. Works well with the papaya mask. Gentile cleanser with just a touch of grit to help scrub away the dead skin. Light fragrance</li>
    <li> 100% vegetarian ingredients, no parabens or animal testing, love this product</li>
    <li> Love this product! Arrived sooner than expected!</li>
    <li> One of the only &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products that does not break me out on my face.</li>
    <li> This leaves an oily residue on my skin after just one use. NOT cool. I already have oily skin and use a medicated acne lotion, so I don&#x27;t need something leaving my skin feeling oily after washing! I like that it is organic and doesn&#x27;t contain harmful chemicals or parabens, and it has a light pineapple scent. The scrubbing granules are pretty large, but they didn&#x27;t scratch my face much...I&#x27;ve used more abrasive products than this. I would probably use this once or twice a week in the winter when my skin gets dry patches, but not during the summer.</li>
    <li> smells amazing, really cleanses face easily, love it.</li>
    <li> Excellent!  Would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> This face scrub is just okay. It has a pleasant smell and has just the right amount of exfoliating effect. Ingredients are good. However, on my combination/oily skin this rather creamy face scrub takes far too long to wash completely off my face. For some reason, the exfoliating beads and product stick to my face and take longer than usual to wash off with water. I would purchase the product again if it wasn&#x27;t such a hassle to feel it had been completely washed off my face.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this facial scrub. It&#x27;s not too abrasive, made from organic ingredients, and keeps my face clean. Recommended.</li>
    <li> I have had great luck with other products I have used from this line, but this one was not what I expected. My assumption was it would be good for an oilier skin type. The product has an oily consistency and it leaves behind a film. I am sure this would be great for a drier or normal skin, but not optimal for an oilier skin. I assumed by the name Pore Purifying Pineapple Enzyme Facial Scrub that it would be a good option for my skin.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It&#x27;s gentle on the skin, but gets the job done.  It&#x27;s a great scrub that doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling like it&#x27;s been rubbed raw.  Awesome smell too!  I&#x27;ve tried St Ives, and the smells aren&#x27;t really natural and pleasant.  This one has a great fruit smell and is perfect for fair skinned people with delicate skin -- especially us older folks.  I used to buy this product at my local CVS in NH, but we moved.  I was so disappointed I couldn&#x27;t find it in the local stores in CO that I tracked it down and ordered it online.... now that&#x27;s a dedicated customer  ;-)</li>
    <li> I love this face wash! My complexion has never looked better!</li>
    <li> Nice gentle scrub wth a great scent. It has not  not dried my face. Will purchase again to continue to use during the winter.  Not sure if this will be the best choice for the summer.  Less harsh than the St. Ives apricot scrub although I love that one too. I have had it for around 1 month and the 4 oz will last me around 2 months.</li>
    <li> Works good but unfortunately for me, it broke me out in a rash however for my daughter it does well without a reaction.  I now only use it once a month.</li>
    <li> I Love Alba products.  I use the face scrub in the shower and the regular face wash for daily skin care</li>
    <li> This product is amazing, very gentle on your skin and feels refreshed after every use.</li>
