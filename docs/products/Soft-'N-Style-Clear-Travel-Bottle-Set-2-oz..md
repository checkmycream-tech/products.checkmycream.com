      <li>Okay bottles.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re okay.</li>
      <li>Just glad they did not leak.</li>
      <li>I put a bit of perfume in one spray bottle to carry my favorite scent and some non-aerosol hair spray in another.  </li>
      <li>Great little bottles in a great sealed bag that can go in any suitcase or makeup case.</li>

      <li>Very effective spray for applying facial toner: lightweight, easy to use spray button, fine mist.  </li>

      <li>Cheap.  </li>
      <li>Super cheap, leaked / broke in</li>

      <li>The crystal clear bottles made it easy to tell things apart, too.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It also includes a sturdy enough carrying case that shouldn&#x27;t leak if something would happen to do so, keeping your luggage safe on your travels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>exactly what I wanted/needed for my trip.</li>
      <li>I still put them inside a regulation size zip lock bag and into a larger one for easy access and to protect against leakage.</li>
      <li>the bottles are just fine, the case is cheap, and pulled apart after a few days use.</li>
      <li>the bottles seem very durable.  </li>
      <li>good quality bottles, decent spray action - hasn&#x27;t failed yet, after a full 3 weeks of vacation use.</li>
      <li>first and second uses.  </li>
      <li>but they are clear not colored.</li>
      <li>one thing to note is that they are all completely clear, unlike the picture where the bottles are colored.</li>
      <li>The kit comes with all clear bottles in a clear plastic zip pouch.</li>
      <li>You kinda have to get one of these if you travel frequently.</li>
      <li>The case was less useful than a ziploc, it arrived already falling apart at the seams (which seemed to be barely sealed together)</li>

    <li> The case was less useful than a ziploc, it arrived already falling apart at the seams (which seemed to be barely sealed together), I bought this for a flight I&#x27;ll be going on soon and the bottles still seem to be useable (no idea how well they&#x27;ll be under pressure) so I dont have time to request a refund, but the bag itself is absolutely pointless, it barely stays together and the zip part is really rough to open.</li>
    <li> like the bottles but they are clear not colored. sometimes i grab the wrong one.</li>
    <li> the bottles are just fine, the case is cheap, and pulled apart after a few days use.</li>
    <li> I used these for a 3 week trip to take my facial products in checked luggage.  I was very happy that they din&#x27;t leak, lids fit tight and the sprayers all reach the bottom and function well.  It was helpful to have both sprays for liquids and pumps for lotions in one set. The crystal clear bottles made it easy to tell things apart, too.</li>
    <li> Got these to go on the plane.  Filled them with lotion and hair styling spray.  Everything stayed sealed and didn&#x27;t leak on me.  Of course I would still recommend testing them for leaks before you pack them.  One star docked because one of the lotion pumps did not work for me.  The other pump, however, worked great.  I don&#x27;t know why one worked and the other didn&#x27;t.  Either way, I just screwed off the lid and dumped it onto my hand that way.  Still efficient.  Just glad they did not leak.</li>
    <li> Just as sturdy as you would find in a super store. No issues.</li>
    <li> all the pump works as should.</li>
    <li> Okay bottles. The top gets unscrewed easily, which causes leakage.</li>
    <li> This did the job, but not really worth the money. I could have saved a few dollars buying the pieces separately at Target.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for travel.</li>
    <li> Very good quality and just what I was looking for.  I use it on a daily basis and have had no issues with the pumps which is a big for me. the bottles seem very durable.  would recommend.</li>
    <li> Worked great on my travels</li>
    <li> These bottles should work great for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;I have by count: 2 lotion type bottle, 2 spray bottle, and one capped bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve mainly used the spray bottles at length, and I can say that the spray comes out even and as a fine mist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also includes a sturdy enough carrying case that shouldn&#x27;t leak if something would happen to do so, keeping your luggage safe on your travels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;- pumps work well&lt;br /&gt;- plastic case should hold up to prevent leaks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- maybe expensive for what you are getting (but have not compared to any store prices)</li>
    <li> I really like this set because it comes with two spray bottles and two pump bottles (which you usually don&#x27;t find with travel bottle sets).</li>
    <li> Great bottles, well-made. I like that they are colored for easier identification of what is inside.</li>
    <li> These worked well for me when I traveled this summer.</li>
    <li> The bottles are not colored as it appears in the photo. The kit comes with all clear bottles in a clear plastic zip pouch. It is &amp;#34;not the look of aluminum&amp;#34; as described</li>
    <li> exactly what I wanted/needed for my trip. good quality bottles, decent spray action - hasn&#x27;t failed yet, after a full 3 weeks of vacation use.</li>
    <li> Did the job, handy travel bottles.</li>
    <li> Great little bottles in a great sealed bag that can go in any suitcase or makeup case.</li>
    <li> You get a variety of bottles - 2 spray bottles, 2 pump bottles, and 1 regular screw-off cap bottle. They&#x27;re okay.</li>
    <li> Super cheap, leaked / broke in first and second uses.  Now trash.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed! Small, travel sized bottles with spray pumps for my cosmetics. There was even one without a pump tht I can use for lotions.</li>
    <li> These are perfect for travel.</li>
    <li> they do not leak which is a big plus for me.</li>
    <li> Love it! Super convenient. You kinda have to get one of these if you travel frequently. I was a lil concerned about the pumps, and sometimes you can&#x27;t get anything out even when there&#x27;s like 1/5 of the stuff left. But all those concerns went away once a started using them!</li>
    <li> Not one leak on two trips now.  Perfect size.  Difficult putting anything thick inside bottles (lotion, conditioner, gel)</li>
    <li> I travel a lot and this travel sized kit has worked great. No issues at all.</li>
    <li> These bottles were not the highest quality but were effective at holding liquids for international travel and for the price I really couldn&#x27;t complain. I liked the variety provided- one thing to note is that they are all completely clear, unlike the picture where the bottles are colored.</li>
    <li> Very effective spray for applying facial toner: lightweight, easy to use spray button, fine mist.  Just what I wanted,after trying others.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t leak, ive flown twice with these and have had no issues with them.</li>
    <li> These were great for travel instead of taking full size bottles of the product.</li>
    <li> Great Little Spray Bottles.  Going to use to spray acrylic and watercover paint on canvas!</li>
    <li> These bottles are perfect for weekend getaways and carry on travel. I put a bit of perfume in one spray bottle to carry my favorite scent and some non-aerosol hair spray in another.  You can put in just what you will need, save money not buying the travel size bottles, and save the added weight in your carry on as well by not carrying a full travel size bottle. I still put them inside a regulation size zip lock bag and into a larger one for easy access and to protect against leakage.</li>
    <li> These suck, they don&#x27;t spray</li>
    <li> Cheap.  Everything leaked. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Actually comes with 2 pumps and 2 sprays.  One of the pumps I had with lotion stopped working after a couple of times.  Sprays still work.</li>
    <li> For small inexpensive plastic bottles, they are what you&#x27;d expect...nothing great but not bad.</li>
