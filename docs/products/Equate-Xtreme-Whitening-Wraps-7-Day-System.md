### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>They work great!</li>
      <li>I followed the instructions perfectly and I&#x27;ve never had this problem with whitening strips.</li>
      <li>Works great!</li>
      <li>I am very pleased and so is my wallet!</li>
      <li>lol.  </li>
      <li>Work great, no compaints.</li>
      <li>Great for people on a budget like I said.</li>
      <li>Not doing the math, I didn&#x27;t realize these weren&#x27;t that good of a deal.</li>
      <li>and the ingredients used are very safe.  </li>
      <li>They fit great in my opinion &amp; I love the results!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what kind of side effects there&#x27;s supposed to be but</li>
      <li>Sure they aren&#x27;t the best whitening product on the market but its definitely worth the price if you are on a budget like I am.</li>
      <li>Very easy to use.</li>
      <li>Well, it wasn&#x27;t, but it sure looked like it was.  </li>
      <li>OK, this is my experience -</li>
      <li>I love these strips.</li>
      <li>/&gt;these trays are even better then walgreen&#x27;s house brand.  </li>
      <li>They were $14.89 and it has 7 top and 7 bottom gel whiting retainers.</li>
      <li>If you accidentally let the top tray touch the bottom tray, it will pull both of them off.</li>
      <li>If money is no object, go with Crest Whitestrips as they are more comfortable to apply/wear, but these did do the job.</li>
      <li>But, other than that, these strips are great!</li>
      <li>The wraps comform to my teeth so easily and stay on the full 30 minutes!</li>
      <li>it also matter how comfortable and easy to use they are-</li>
      <li>and they work just fine.</li>
      <li>They aren&#x27;t anything like the smooth crest wraps.</li>
      <li>+ on the crest kit when this product is available.</li>
      <li>The trays have made my gum so irritated and bruised, they were bleeding with light brushing.</li>
      <li>I have not noticed a significant difference in my teeth color.</li>
      <li>what else, right!  </li>
      <li>It is true that you get what you pay for.</li>
      <li>I will definitely continue to use for the rest of the 7 days and buy more if needed :)</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m always looking for a whiter smile and</li>
      <li>How are these useful????  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t understand why anyone in their right mind would spend the $50</li>
      <li>The only thing i don&#x27;t like about them is that they sting my gums a little bit, and they don&#x27;t taste the best.</li>
      <li>Although this product is more reasonably priced, I&#x27;m surprised that others rave about it..</li>
      <li>and this time, buy the Crest White Strips as they have gotten much better reviews.</li>
      <li>I am in the process of getting veneers on the top teeth and bought these to lighten the bottom teeth only.  </li>
      <li>Although I found the strips very easy to use, they had absolutely no effect on my teeth, which after 6 days show no difference at all.</li>
      <li>The first use was simple and easy.</li>
      <li>However, they are very sticky when trying to take them off.</li>
      <li>My teeth weren&#x27;t stained really to begin with</li>
      <li>It seems cheap compared to the $50 price tag of Crest&#x27;s 3D White.</li>
      <li>That said, having used a more expensive product years ago (which proved messy, slippery and not as effective), I must say I love the form fitting &#x27;technology&#x27; (as described on the box) and the convenience of how well the wraps sticks, how sturdy they are, and how comfortable it is to apply the wraps to my upper and lower teeth at the same time for 30 minutes.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It much easier to use these wraps than most other products out there.</li>
      <li>they all use hydrogen peroxide, but how strong it is and how long you leave it on your teeth matters.  </li>
      <li>The top and bottom wraps stuck to each other instead.</li>
      <li>The wraps are loose, slip and come off easily even though I followed the instructions regarding drying my teeth beforehand etc.  </li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised after the first use.</li>
      <li>Today is my 3rd day using this product and given the results, I&#x27;m considering not going the full 7 days because my teeth look great!&lt;br</li>
      <li>Mainly in price because 10 of the crest strips cost $19.99.</li>
      <li>and I had relatively high hopes for it.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend to everybody.</li>
      <li>I only need 3 every now and then to brighten up my smile.</li>
      <li>I will never use this product again and would rather pay the extra bucks for something useful.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;d have an electronic reminder of a product I&#x27;d be interested in purchasing again, and was surprised by the low ratings.</li>
      <li>people dont seem to realize pretty much all the kits out there are the same, its the application thats different.  </li>
      <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this for anyone with extremely sensitive gums.</li>
      <li>I read from the box that there may be some side effects in people with sensitive gums</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t use this product if you have sensitive gums.</li>
      <li>They Do Not Fit Comfortably In Your Mouth.</li>
      <li>They also made my gums sensitive and sore when I had to brush.</li>
      <li>you DO NOT need to dry your teeth first.  </li>
      <li>The next morning my gum went back to normal color, but as soon as I started brushing my teeth, my gum bled!</li>
      <li>You can barely move your mouth around or they will slip off.</li>
      <li>I bought this product at a local store and was surprised that it was much cheaper then then other brands, but decided to give it a try anyway.  </li>
      <li>If you do not dry your teeth first they will not stick and you have to leave them in for a half hour.</li>

<li> (yes that&#x27;s how long they kept my teeth white!)</li>
<li> product conforms comfortably and securely to my teeth after a minute or so, and, as stated in the instructions, if you rinse with cold water it comes right off...but pulling it off minus cold water has not been an issue for me.</li>
<li> I bought this at Walmart due to the low price</li>
<li> but I am an occasional dark soda drinker.</li>
<li> Do not use if you have a loose</li>
<li> But truth is it&#x27;s only slightly cheaper.</li>
<li> The only issue is that my gums are a little tingly after</li>
<li> I have to spend thirty minutes with my mouth tightly closed in the hopes that will hold the bottom tray in place.</li>
<li> I used it just like they said, but there was absolutely no difference in the color of my teeth.  </li>
<li> What a total waste.  </li>
<li> Figured I&#x27;d buy it in lieu of shelling out the $50+ for other brands.</li>
<li> I bought these at my local Walmart for $14.99 (not sure why amazon is selling them for $25)</li>
<li> All of you who gave negative reviews are obviously illiterate and dont know how to follow instructions.</li>
<li> It did whiten teeth a little but not really worth it.</li>
<li> they lose potency after the directed time period, i just like to leave them in a little longer to get all i can.</li>
<li> Also, they hydrogen peroxide in the whitening strips burnt a little bit of my gums and bleached the edges of my gums a little.</li>
<li> these gave me just the little boost that I needed.</li>
<li> I guess compared to the twice a day ten minutes a day, thin crest whitening strips they&#x27;re comparable.</li>
<li> Compared to my usual Crest Whitestrips, using these &amp;#34;trays&amp;#34; was quite uncomfortable to have in my mouth since they are very bulky and have a bad taste to them, however , they did stay on my teeth and were not difficult to take off.</li>
<li> They take just a few seconds to conform to your teeth and stay in place for the 30 minutes you have to keep them on.</li>
<li> Waste of money.</li>
<li> I think a refund plus my trouble is in order.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your time, effort and money on this garbage.</li>
<li> I just peel the wraps off slowly and brush my teeth afterward</li>
<li> This was very painful and even left part of my gums white.</li>
<li> in fact, after a half hour they are sort of difficult to peel off.  </li>
<li> /&gt;the tray is a little difficult and uncomfortable but they do the job</li>
<li> Chances are the negative reviews are from people putting the wrong side on their teeth.</li>
<li> Dramatic difference.</li>
<li> They Also Turned My Gums White &amp; They Were Very Painful.</li>
<li> My advice: don&#x27;t waste your money-very disappointed in this.</li>
<li> If you now realize that you put them on wrong then</li>
<li> I&#x27;m so sorry I ever bought this thing.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought this product at a local store and was surprised that it was much cheaper then then other brands, but decided to give it a try anyway.  All I can say is that this is the worst product ever.  The wraps are loose, slip and come off easily even though I followed the instructions regarding drying my teeth beforehand etc.  I used the product for 3 days and noticed no difference. I&#x27;m going to try and return it and this time, buy the Crest White Strips as they have gotten much better reviews. Don&#x27;t waste your time, effort and money on this garbage.</li>
    <li> All of you who gave negative reviews are obviously illiterate and dont know how to follow instructions. On my 4th day. Dramatic difference. Work great, no compaints. Especially in price. Would highly recommend to everybody.</li>
    <li> people dont seem to realize pretty much all the kits out there are the same, its the application thats different.  they all use hydrogen peroxide, but how strong it is and how long you leave it on your teeth matters.  it also matter how comfortable and easy to use they are- thats where these shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;these trays are even better then walgreen&#x27;s house brand.  you DO NOT need to dry your teeth first.  Just leave the trays in, and after about 10 minutes they will gelform to your teeth.  in fact, after a half hour they are sort of difficult to peel off.  Do not use if you have a loose tooth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also think these are stronger power then others.  after 3 applications your teeth will look obviously different.  just tell people you went to the dentist!  and the ingredients used are very safe.  i go longer then what the instructions say, i know youre not supposed to but there have been stories online of people leaving these in overnight without issue.  they lose potency after the directed time period, i just like to leave them in a little longer to get all i can.</li>
    <li> I bought these from my local walmart. They were $14.89 and it has 7 top and 7 bottom gel whiting retainers. they remind me of hockey mouth guards. The first use was simple and easy. However, they are very sticky when trying to take them off. If you do not dry your teeth first they will not stick and you have to leave them in for a half hour. I have not noticed a significant difference in my teeth color. Also, they hydrogen peroxide in the whitening strips burnt a little bit of my gums and bleached the edges of my gums a little. They also made my gums sensitive and sore when I had to brush. The instructions also do not tell whether or not you are supposed to brush before or after using the strips. I guess compared to the twice a day ten minutes a day, thin crest whitening strips they&#x27;re comparable. Mainly in price because 10 of the crest strips cost $19.99. I am just hoping the pain I put my gums through isn&#x27;t going to cause permanent damage.</li>
    <li> I picked these up for $15. It&#x27;s a 7 day set (7 uppers + 7 lowers). Not doing the math, I didn&#x27;t realize these weren&#x27;t that good of a deal. It seems cheap compared to the $50 price tag of Crest&#x27;s 3D White. But truth is it&#x27;s only slightly cheaper. Because the Crest Whitestrips come with 20 days (40 total strips). Also to note these do not work that well. It did whiten teeth a little but not really worth it.</li>
    <li> MY LIPS ARE STILL BURNING 24 HOURS LATER FROM THESE WRAPS!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand why anyone in their right mind would spend the $50+ on the crest kit when this product is available. It&#x27;s $14 and some change at Walmart and I&#x27;m on my third day and I already see a big difference! The wraps comform to my teeth so easily and stay on the full 30 minutes! The only issue is that my gums are a little tingly after so I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this for anyone with extremely sensitive gums. I am very pleased and so is my wallet!</li>
    <li> I purchased these from Walmart, not Amazon. Terrible product.  Followed directions and they would not stay on my teeth.  The top and bottom wraps stuck to each other instead.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t use this product if you have sensitive gums. This was very painful and even left part of my gums white. I&#x27;ll have to continue searching for another product to whiten my teeth. I hope to get my money back.</li>
    <li> Comparing equate with crest whitening strips: I think this product would work well if it would actually stay on your teeth. You can barely move your mouth around or they will slip off. I used crest whitening strips 2 years ago (yes that&#x27;s how long they kept my teeth white!) and I thought this cheaper brand would do just as well, but if you can&#x27;t even get the wraps to stay on, it doesn&#x27;t matter how well they work if they won&#x27;t stick. And by the way, those &#x27;wraps&#x27; are actually annoying trays. They aren&#x27;t anything like the smooth crest wraps. With crest whitening strips, you didn&#x27;t feel like you had to spit every couple minutes like you do with the equate trays. If you accidentally let the top tray touch the bottom tray, it will pull both of them off. The instructions say if you need help getting them off then to rinse your mouth in water and they will come off, but they don&#x27;t even need to put those instructions in cuz they keep getting off by themselves. So annoying. I will never use this product again and would rather pay the extra bucks for something useful.</li>
    <li> It is true that you get what you pay for. Although this product is more reasonably priced, I&#x27;m surprised that others rave about it.. Although I found the strips very easy to use, they had absolutely no effect on my teeth, which after 6 days show no difference at all. My advice: don&#x27;t waste your money-very disappointed in this.</li>
    <li> OK, this is my experience - what else, right!  lol.  I used it just like they said, but there was absolutely no difference in the color of my teeth.  I took a before and after photo, and there is no difference.  When I showed the photos to my husband, he said, &amp;#34;That&#x27;s the same photo!&amp;#34;  Well, it wasn&#x27;t, but it sure looked like it was.  I would show you the two photos, if I could.  Well, that is how it worked for me.  : (</li>
    <li> I love these strips. I am on my 3rd day out of 7, and i can already notice a difference. The only thing i don&#x27;t like about them is that they sting my gums a little bit, and they don&#x27;t taste the best. But, other than that, these strips are great!</li>
    <li> They work great! Chances are the negative reviews are from people putting the wrong side on their teeth. Hence the complaints that they wont stay on and seeing no results. The side thats facing up in the tray is the side that goes on the teeth. The side that peels from the tray does not. If you now realize that you put them on wrong then the class thing to do is update your review.</li>
    <li> Being involved in the dental field, I&#x27;m constantly concerned about the color of my teeth. I bought these at my local Walmart for $14.99 (not sure why amazon is selling them for $25) but I did notice results in 3 days. Sure they aren&#x27;t the best whitening product on the market but its definitely worth the price if you are on a budget like I am. I don&#x27;t smoke or drink coffee but I am an occasional dark soda drinker. My teeth weren&#x27;t stained really to begin with but I&#x27;m always looking for a whiter smile and these gave me just the little boost that I needed. Great for people on a budget like I said. Very easy to use. I had no problems applying or removing. They take just a few seconds to conform to your teeth and stay in place for the 30 minutes you have to keep them on. I leave mine in while I shower and they work just fine.</li>
    <li> Bottom would not stay on my teeth, fell off after 15 seconds.  How are these useful????  I think a refund plus my trouble is in order.  What a total waste.  DON\\&quot;T spend money on these. END OF STORY.</li>
    <li> Works great! I only need 3 every now and then to brighten up my smile. I get compliments on how white me teeth are all the time. They fit great in my opinion &amp; I love the results!</li>
    <li> I picked these up from my local store. I cannot, no matter what, get the bottom tray to stick to my teeth. I have to spend thirty minutes with my mouth tightly closed in the hopes that will hold the bottom tray in place. It simply slides around from side to side if left alone. I followed the instructions perfectly and I&#x27;ve never had this problem with whitening strips.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product from my local Walmart. Figured I&#x27;d buy it in lieu of shelling out the $50+ for other brands. Was sold on the idea of the \\&quot;Quality Guaranteed\\&quot; seal. Figured I&#x27;d try it for 3 days and return it if I saw no results within that timeframe. Granted, I&#x27;m neither a smoker nor a coffee drinker, so I figured 30 minutes a day of whitening would prove beneficial within 3 days or wouldn&#x27;t prove beneficial at all. I was pleasantly surprised after the first use. My teeth are literally &#x27;pearly white&#x27;! Today is my 3rd day using this product and given the results, I&#x27;m considering not going the full 7 days because my teeth look great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came onsite to &#x27;Wish List&#x27; this product so I&#x27;d have an electronic reminder of a product I&#x27;d be interested in purchasing again, and was surprised by the low ratings. That said, having used a more expensive product years ago (which proved messy, slippery and not as effective), I must say I love the form fitting &#x27;technology&#x27; (as described on the box) and the convenience of how well the wraps sticks, how sturdy they are, and how comfortable it is to apply the wraps to my upper and lower teeth at the same time for 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product conforms comfortably and securely to my teeth after a minute or so, and, as stated in the instructions, if you rinse with cold water it comes right off...but pulling it off minus cold water has not been an issue for me. I just peel the wraps off slowly and brush my teeth afterward (although the instructions don&#x27;t speak to pre- or post-brushing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> Compared to my usual Crest Whitestrips, using these &amp;#34;trays&amp;#34; was quite uncomfortable to have in my mouth since they are very bulky and have a bad taste to them, however , they did stay on my teeth and were not difficult to take off. I did see results after 2 uses. If money is no object, go with Crest Whitestrips as they are more comfortable to apply/wear, but these did do the job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my 3rd day using these and I already see a big difference.  I will definitely continue to use for the rest of the 7 days and buy more if needed :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the tray is a little difficult and uncomfortable but they do the job</li>
    <li> It much easier to use these wraps than most other products out there. The teeth get white and it doesn&#x27;t break my budget.</li>
    <li> I am in the process of getting veneers on the top teeth and bought these to lighten the bottom teeth only.  After finishing the bottom molds and seeing no change, I trimmed the upper molds at the corners and used those also on the bottom teeth.  I  left them in for an hour each time, each day.  Total days used 12.  NOTHING.  No change at all.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I bought this at Walmart due to the low price and I had relatively high hopes for it. Boy was I wrong.&lt;br /&gt;After using the second strip on the second day, I noticed the part of my gum that touched the strip turned white. Yes, my GUM got dyed white. I read from the box that there may be some side effects in people with sensitive gums so I disregarded this. The next morning my gum went back to normal color, but as soon as I started brushing my teeth, my gum bled! The trays have made my gum so irritated and bruised, they were bleeding with light brushing. I don&#x27;t know what kind of side effects there&#x27;s supposed to be but losing blood is not acceptable. I&#x27;m so sorry I ever bought this thing.</li>
    <li> They Do Not Fit Comfortably In Your Mouth. I Used It &amp; It Didn&#x27;t Whiten My Teeth At All.&lt;br /&gt;I Used Them Just As Directed. They Also Turned My Gums White &amp; They Were Very Painful. Definitely Dissapointed.</li>
