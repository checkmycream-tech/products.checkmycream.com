    <li> Nothing to really note here. They&#x27;re applicator bottles and work as expected.</li>
    <li> Item is good and long lasting. Mine didn&#x27;t have the measurements in black though, but have been using them for years without any issues. Good buy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bottle. but seriously, be prepared to open the tip, they come sealed.</li>
    <li> I like this bottle, only wish I have known you have the cut the hole in the top on your own. I put oil in bottle to put in my hair and nothing wasn&#x27;t coming out, and had to cut my own hole. That was the only downside.</li>
    <li> Nice bottles for all purpose or everyday uses.....durable enough.</li>
    <li> There isn&#x27;t much not to like about these bottles.  They serve their purpose.  The tops seem to stay on tight.  Would have like to have had something that would keep the little red cap attached to the bottle so you wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about losing it  but other then that I have no complaints about these applicator bottles.</li>
    <li> I took a risk and ordered these in spite of some of the reviews. The bottles I received are soft, but sturdy. Also, they look just like the one in the picture (clear, measurements on the side, with red caps). Someone mentioned having to cut the nozzle because it is not opened when they arrive. To get around that, I took the metal end of my rattail comb and poked it in the hole. It was the PERFECT size. This way, I did not have to cut anything and the cap still fit. I use one bottle for scalp treatments (carrier oils with essential oils), and another for relaxer base for easy application. I didn&#x27;t need six, but I am sure I will put them to good use.</li>
    <li> I use these bottles for body oils that I make and use at home.  I love these bottles.  The price is great.  The bottles are sturdy and easy to handle.  The measurements on the side have rubbed off, which makes me a tad bit sad but otherwise, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Was as advertised. Did the job I needed them for. Held several different liquid glues with no problems.</li>
    <li> The ones that arrived did not have a cap which is an important distinction. And these are an &amp;#34;add-on&amp;#34; item so I&#x27;m not sure how returns or exchanges work.</li>
    <li> was exactly as advertised</li>
    <li> This product was exactly what I was looking for to mix all my natural oils for easy application to my hair and daughters hair.</li>
    <li> Wow! Where can I begin! These are AWESOME! They sturdy and durable. Also, It came with all six like it said it was. I even put the bottle in the microwave to melt some coconut oil and the bottle didn&#x27;t melt a bit but the oil did. I wear a lot of braids and protective hairstyles because i&#x27;m in college, so it&#x27;s EXTREMELY easy to get this bottle in my scalp to give it the nutrients it needs!</li>
    <li> I use these to put oil in to apply to my scalp. Makes that task less messy. It&#x27;s very easy to use. My bottles did not come w/ the applicator tips which I really did want but they are still very useful. Just do not put the bottle in the microwave to heat up oil. The actual bottle can withstand a quick heat up but the top will melt/crack. If you want to heat up your oils just put it in a cup of hot water.</li>
    <li> The bottles I received were not as pictured in his description. The ones I received had a long black applicator tip with no cap. I specifically needed bottles with a cap as seen in the picture. I was disappointed and frustrated, to say the least.</li>
    <li> These bottles do exactly what they should. The tips do not have a hole in them. I read another recommendation and poked a hole in the top with my small nail scissors rather than cutting the tip to open it up and that worked perfectly.</li>
    <li> Bottles shipped fast.  I augmented the tips of nozzles by cutting the very tip off bc my hair oils weren&#x27;t coming through fast enough for me.  Just scissored a tiny bit off, and the red cap still fits like a charm.</li>
    <li> Got exactly what I bought, Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> These bottles are wonderful.  They each came with a little red cap which makes traveling with them hassle free.  I use them to mix oils and do hair treatments and they are great. If needed I will definitely be buying more!</li>
    <li> I love these applicator bottles for mixing my hair oils or body oils. I like that they have clear markings of how many ounces you are using so that you know exactly how much product you are mixing.  I use these bottles daily.</li>
