      <li>Overall you cannot beat this kit for the price, it is an excellent backup kit or starter kit to learn on.</li>
      <li>99% sure that Amazon fulfilled the order, so</li>
      <li>/&gt;The needles are ok, there are better ones out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Alot more problems with it.</li>
      <li>I ended up liking this footswitch better than my hotfoot switch.</li>
      <li>something better quality.</li>
      <li>I was really expecting something good.</li>
      <li>Easy set up.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a beginner and everything worked fine.</li>
      <li>Everything is fine except , my mini power box isn&#x27;t working yet and its not oval shaped like in the display...</li>
      <li>But if you intend to just use the gun and extras it comes with im sure its worth the money.</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;ve ordered a seperate set of practice skin, quite cheap.</li>
      <li>foot switch is cheap though.</li>
      <li>For being so cheap</li>
      <li>Cheap is cheap...</li>
      <li>Great kit for its price, though I never received the practice skin and came with only one metal tip.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Could need a better foot pedal but other then that its great</li>
      <li>obviously its not going to be a super professional power supply and kit, so you cant always expect the best...</li>
      <li>The gun is nice that tattoos come out nice just one problem is it said black ink</li>
      <li>Other than that everything else was great.</li>
      <li>It arrived three days after purchase, super quick</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure what I was actually supposed to get isn&#x27;t much better than what I did get...</li>
      <li>Other than that its great and worth the $</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t look fresh at all.</li>
      <li>works great for small tattoos</li>
      <li>Very cheap only used it 2 times before giving out for no reason</li>
      <li>Pretty, though.</li>
      <li>and I feel like this is exactly what I need to start off.</li>
      <li>I am Very upset.</li>
      <li>I  really Like,</li>
      <li>Cant really beat the price.</li>
      <li>Tried/used it 3 times, 1st time worked great, 2nd time it stopped during a tattoo several times, 3rd time didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
      <li>After I hand straightened the bend, the machine ran better than two of my other machines (so now this one is going into my arsenal instead of just parts)</li>
      <li>a lot of people need to realize that a small power supply like this one in the kit can over heat very easily...</li>
      <li>The power supply is tiny but ample, does not get too hot.</li>
      <li>Not bad need a better foot switch and sometimes it will randomly stop working</li>
      <li>I did a tattoo on myself and it looked fine for a few days and</li>
      <li>Considering this is a beginner kit and there are numerous parts, I think it wouldn&#x27;t be too much to expect that there be some DIRECTIONS maybe?  </li>
      <li>/&gt;But whether it came directly from the seller, or Amazon ware house...</li>
      <li>Overall i&#x27;m disappointed, but not to upset since it is my own fault for buying something cheap.</li>
      <li>but the ink was green instead of black, if I decide I want more ink</li>
      <li>Cant speak for the ink or other stuff that came with it, but I REALLY like the power cord that came with the kit.</li>
      <li>Works great, I was worried that the,quality would be bad bc of the low cost but that wasn&#x27;t the case.</li>
      <li>If you dont know jack about tattoing then you might want to have a buddy tune this machine for you, other than that - it is decent.</li>
      <li>Is this brand new,I&#x27;m guessing it is,saw other guns say new</li>

<li> did contact the seller about the missing skin and tip, they where quick to respond and agreed with no issue to send the missing items.</li>
<li> Got it on time but when i tried to use it the power supply doesnt turn on waste of my money either want a refund or a new power supply...</li>
<li> Had to order twice first one missing half of stuff</li>
<li> and if there&#x27;s a short in the power supply all it takes is a little bit of soldering and that&#x27;s it...</li>
<li> second one got brought bad as return for first one without proper return labels never put on</li>
<li> The design on the machine itself looks like a melted chilly pepper, but if you are like me, I dont really care what the machine looks like, only how well it works.</li>
<li> Just Got My Kit Yesterday &amp;amp; The Only Complaint That i Have is the pedal is Plastic &amp;amp; feels like it might break.  </li>
<li> just lost bout $40, not worth it.</li>
<li> The order said black ink</li>
<li> Crappy it gave out 3 tattoos after buying in less than a week</li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t get black ink though, it came with purple ink that doesn&#x27;t stay in your skin..</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> Like how to put this sucker together?  </li>
<li> This is my second order from this company in a week because of poor quality in the equipment once again in the middle of a tattoo the power supply took a crap left me in another bad situation.</li>
<li> The coil tape looks cheesy, and the metal frame that came with the machine had a slight bend in it.</li>
<li> After 5 minutes it stopped working no good I paid for this item</li>
<li> power supply is no good at all.</li>
<li> wtf is going on?</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> a lot of people need to realize that a small power supply like this one in the kit can over heat very easily... they always say you get what you pay for. obviously its not going to be a super professional power supply and kit, so you cant always expect the best... after all the kit is only just about 25 dollars. don&#x27;t tattoo yourself every day of the week. and if there&#x27;s a short in the power supply all it takes is a little bit of soldering and that&#x27;s it...</li>
    <li> Power supply just died in the middle of making my tattoo and it sucked not recommended</li>
    <li> Good gun. Comes with no directions but just google &amp;#34; how to assemble tattoo machine&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Recommend getting a new foot pedal but for the price, this thing is perfect</li>
    <li> The gun is nice that tattoos come out nice just one problem is it said black ink and it came with purple</li>
    <li> The hex bar dosent screw in it did one time and thats it..</li>
    <li> The gun keep shutting off n stopping n it gave out n no longer works</li>
    <li> Machine works great power supply is a piece of</li>
    <li> This is why only licensed professionals should be tattooing.</li>
    <li> It works great, in my opinion. Ink is better than I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> Everything came in pictured above. Tattoo gun works good! For this price it was a good deal</li>
    <li> It was good quality stuff</li>
    <li> Pretty good for a beginners tattoo kit!! My bf has already given his 1st 2 tattoos ever and hasn&#x27;t had any problems out of it yet!! Hopefully he won&#x27;t!!</li>
    <li> Power supply wont work after 10 minutes of use i recommend a different kit</li>
    <li> Crappy it gave out 3 tattoos after buying in less than a week</li>
    <li> Had to order twice first one missing half of stuff second one got brought bad as return for first one without proper return labels never put on some how and now they want me order again</li>
    <li> Love this machines it works get for what I use it for. I&#x27;m just beginning tattooing and I feel like this is exactly what I need to start off.</li>
    <li> Works great, I was worried that the,quality would be bad bc of the low cost but that wasn&#x27;t the case. It arrived three days after purchase, super quick</li>
    <li> I received this today,  everything came as shown in the picture but the ink was green instead of black, if I decide I want more ink I&#x27;ll buy some sepreatly,  for a beginner this is a good kit,  I&#x27;m a beginner and everything worked fine.</li>
    <li> stopped working next day..</li>
    <li> Everything was really awesome except they sent freaking white ink!!!! Why would you do this?</li>
    <li> I am Very upset. It came in today. Hooked it up. And it didn&#x27;t work at all. I&#x27;ll be returning this  ! I was really expecting something good. But I&#x27;m never buying anything like this from Amazon again. I rate this 0</li>
    <li> Just got mine today!!!! I&#x27;M happy but it&#x27;s not the same kit on the pic and I was given the wrong ink color</li>
    <li> This is my second order from this company in a week because of poor quality in the equipment once again in the middle of a tattoo the power supply took a crap left me in another bad situation. Don&#x27;t order this product. Very very unhappy.</li>
    <li> After 5 minutes it stopped working no good I paid for this item and it don&#x27;t work&lt;br /&gt;This is bad business&lt;br /&gt;I should get a refund or get sent another one that works ..</li>
    <li> Considering this is a beginner kit and there are numerous parts, I think it wouldn&#x27;t be too much to expect that there be some DIRECTIONS maybe?  Like how to put this sucker together?  How to operate it?  There isn&#x27;t even a model name or number on here to google an owner&#x27;s manual.  WT????&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t buy this to tattoo people.  I&#x27;m a 4-H mom that needs to tattoo rabbit ears for identification.</li>
    <li> Excellent kit, power supply amazingly powerful for not only for its size, but for the PRICE, ang gun is good, runs like a champ, overall excellent product, 5 stars.</li>
    <li> The pedal shocks me sometimes...but the machine runs fairly well. had to google how to set it up though, as it came with no directions.</li>
    <li> This kit is really good for  a starter. The only thing is it doesn&#x27;t come with instructions ... So you have to go on YouTube or whatever to figure out how to peace it all together.</li>
    <li> Is this brand new,I&#x27;m guessing it is,saw other guns say new</li>
    <li> Would not work at all. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I needed an extra power supply and a machine for parts. The coil tape looks cheesy, and the metal frame that came with the machine had a slight bend in it. After I hand straightened the bend, the machine ran better than two of my other machines (so now this one is going into my arsenal instead of just parts) The power supply is tiny but ample, does not get too hot. I ended up liking this footswitch better than my hotfoot switch. It is prone to getting dust inside and requires cleaning out if it stops, recommend a spotless area (which you should have anyway) and a rubber mat. Cant speak for the ink or other stuff that came with it, but I REALLY like the power cord that came with the kit. The design on the machine itself looks like a melted chilly pepper, but if you are like me, I dont really care what the machine looks like, only how well it works. Overall you cannot beat this kit for the price, it is an excellent backup kit or starter kit to learn on. If you dont know jack about tattoing then you might want to have a buddy tune this machine for you, other than that - it is decent. Cant really beat the price. Now I have a second power supply I dont have to wait for my wife to finish with hers.</li>
    <li> Not bad need a better foot switch and sometimes it will randomly stop working but that&#x27;s what I get for buying this kit. Other than that its great and worth the $</li>
    <li> This set was really good i like it theres no lag&lt;br /&gt;Could need a better foot pedal but other then that its great</li>
    <li> Great seller, good contact</li>
    <li> The only thing that matches the picture is the tattoo machine &amp; ink</li>
    <li> both the gun and power supply stoppedworking in like 7 hrs, junk!!!</li>
    <li> It was a wonderful product at a great proce</li>
    <li> My nephew had bought this to practice with and its great</li>
    <li> Everything is fine except , my mini power box isn&#x27;t working yet and its not oval shaped like in the display...wtf is going on?</li>
    <li> Terrible! For being so cheap I guess you get what you pay for, but my power box wouldnt even power on the tattoo gun. No directions on how to put together. One would assume this being a beginners kit you would get instructions. Had to go out an buy another power source.</li>
    <li> Some directions on how to assemble this machine would have been nice. It took us over an hour of googling images to guess how it went together. Pretty, though.</li>
    <li> great beginners kit.  solid build.  foot switch is cheap though.</li>
    <li> Just Got My Kit Yesterday &amp;amp; The Only Complaint That i Have is the pedal is Plastic &amp;amp; feels like it might break.  Besides That Everything Else Is Great . i Just Recommend Investing Into another Pedal. The Ink Stays In Great Too.</li>
    <li> Got it on time but when i tried to use it the power supply doesnt turn on waste of my money either want a refund or a new power supply...</li>
    <li> Great machine, overall a perfect deal. The only thing is that you shouldnt use this ink on anyone but I&#x27;ve tested out the kit on actual skin and the needles I  really Like, Great stuff, man(woman).</li>
    <li> Great kit for its price, though I never received the practice skin and came with only one metal tip. But I&#x27;ve ordered a seperate set of practice skin, quite cheap. But all in all, great stuff. 👍</li>
    <li> Order came very quickly! Although I was sent the wrong kit! Instead of the kit listed I received http://www.amazon.com/Beginner-Tattoo-Machine-Supply-Needles/dp/B00J48LD00/ref&#x3D;aag_m_pw_dp?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;m&#x3D;A3TLZYWP2Q4XVD &amp;#60;that....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The power supply is no good at all. Tried/used it 3 times, 1st time worked great, 2nd time it stopped during a tattoo several times, 3rd time didn&#x27;t work at all. I could hear a low humming noise telling me it was getting power, and when pushing on the foot peddle you could feel in the gun it was trying to get power but no adjustments or attempts to get it going would make it work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The needles are ok, there are better ones out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ink I received was dragonhawk ink, not immortal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also since I didn&#x27;t get the kit listed on this page, I didn&#x27;t get the practice skin, or the 2nd tattoo tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did contact the seller about the missing skin and tip, they where quick to respond and agreed with no issue to send the missing items. At the time I had not realized just yet that i was sent the wrong kit until i started looking around on their shop page and found the one I actually got.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 99% sure that Amazon fulfilled the order, so I do not blame the seller for the mix-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But whether it came directly from the seller, or Amazon ware house... You get what you pay for. I&#x27;m sure what I was actually supposed to get isn&#x27;t much better than what I did get... Cheap is cheap... Make sure to check you items you get to what it shows in the listing and what it says you&#x27;ll get. Overall i&#x27;m disappointed, but not to upset since it is my own fault for buying something cheap. But if you intend to just use the gun and extras it comes with im sure its worth the money. Just dont depend on the power supply, get your self something better quality.</li>
    <li> Good beginner kit..Didn&#x27;t get black ink though, it came with purple ink that doesn&#x27;t stay in your skin..Other than that everything else was great.</li>
    <li> Product is AWSOME 👊🏾👊🏾👊🏾👊🏾</li>
    <li> The order said black ink and I received white ink, what am I supposed to do with white ink make a white outline, gimme a break.</li>
    <li> This was one of my first tattoo machine and kits I purchased and after having it for over a year it still works great! I now have four and they are all good quality performance machines.</li>
    <li> Great it came all in place and very organized, everything placed in bags and boxes, perfect to start doing tattoos for beginers</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work when I tried to use it and I don&#x27;t know how to send it back just lost bout $40, not worth it. Sorry</li>
    <li> good tattoo kit for the price and it came in in 3 days</li>
    <li> Very cheap only used it 2 times before giving out for no reason</li>
    <li> Only is the power cords are not that grate</li>
    <li> The ink is crap it does not set well in the skin. Alot more problems with it. I did a tattoo on myself and it looked fine for a few days and now it looks like I&#x27;ve had that piece for 8 years it doesn&#x27;t look fresh at all. HORRIBLE I tell you absolutely HORRIBLE!</li>
    <li> Great machine. Easy set up. Came with everything but the Practice Skins.  Wasnt the one shown In the picture but to me it was better anyway. Awesome Thanks</li>
    <li> works great for small tattoos</li>
    <li> Power source stopped working as soon as I figured out how to set everything up</li>
