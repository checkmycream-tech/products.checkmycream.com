### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The husband didn&#x27;t even realize when he made it home tonight that it was changed- perfect :0)  </li>
      <li>and the results were GREAT!</li>
      <li>I got a \\&quot;great deal\\&quot; on this as they are promoting it a lot.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Oh, and it didn&#x27;t do a good job at all on the stubborn grays</li>
      <li>gave it 4 stars because it smells and stains quite a bit--otherwise, very very pleased with the resulting hair color.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Because I wanted to buy the Clairol Perfect 10 hair color I like, but I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere except for Amazon, and I wanted to have it right away.</li>
      <li>So many one star reviews!</li>
      <li>I liked the way it saturated my hair, creating even coverage.  </li>
      <li>Despite what others are saying, I really liked this hair color.</li>
      <li>I also thought the foam would be nice, but it splashed all over the place, it did get on my skin</li>
      <li>After rinsing and conditioning, my hair smelled nice.</li>
      <li>The CUSTOMER IS ON THEIR OWN.  </li>
      <li>As with most dyes, be sure to ventilate the room!</li>
      <li>Thanks to  reviewer Sherry Zbar \\&quot;tap shoe\\&quot;, I ignored the written directions in the box and had very good results.   </li>
      <li>I have been coloring my hair for around 20 years and have done my own hair many, many times.</li>
      <li>I thought it was very easy to use &amp; the foam made for more even color distribution.</li>
      <li>was to strip the color from my hair and then re-color with another nice&#x27;n easy product.  </li>
      <li>but I am very happy with the blonde colours.</li>
      <li>ok</li>
      <li>and I am pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>I will continue to use my favorite product, Loreal no drip formula.</li>
      <li>Also, most of the reviews were written a couple years ago &amp; perhaps Clairol has made some changes for the better; I couldn&#x27;t find any type of date on the box or instructions.</li>
      <li>I have a horror story (which many women do) concerning hair color.</li>
      <li>I read the reviews of this product after using it and I would like to say that I did not experience anything which most of the reviews have said to have happened.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I went to several supermarkets and pharmacies, but the Perfect 10 was gone.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know for how many days.</li>
      <li>it seems the people who continuously shake the foam aren&#x27;t pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>I also never leave color on for more than 15-20 minutes.</li>
      <li>(I have used most of them)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The conditioner is also very nice, and my hair came out very soft.</li>
      <li>The results were excellent: good grey coverage, nice overall color, some highlights still visible.</li>
      <li>For me the colour was great, I used extra light blonde and I am very happy with the results</li>
      <li>So easy to use</li>
      <li>never use the foam again, it also had too strong a smell, but I like the scent of the conditioner</li>
      <li>and it was my first attempt to dye my own hair.  </li>
      <li>Their colors are accurate and my hair is always soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a smooth take, shiny, and did well on the grays.</li>
      <li>The application was super easy, but I won&#x27;t be using this again.</li>
      <li>I have to admit, I was excited to try this foam.</li>
      <li>/&gt;My feeling for this product are very positive!</li>
      <li>(The foam is so easy to apply, I can apply it without the help of others with normal dyes and does not get everywhere, just make sure the bottle is held upright and you should be fine!)&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I can honestly say that my hair feels soft and glossy and I am writing this the morning after I applied it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>, that was the only good thing about this product.  </li>
      <li>If they replaced Perfect 10 with this, it should be at least as good.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>With the nice n easy foam (Only purchased because i had a one box free coupon) it really \\&quot;tingled\\&quot; when it went on, and my head is still itchy 12+ hours after using it.</li>
      <li>I normally buy the regular Clairol Nice n Easy Light Brown or Golden Medium Brown, but I had a coupon for this product, and it was on sale.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about coloring my hair at home, and this product has changed my mind.</li>
      <li>I bought the foam on clearance, (now I know why!),in med golden brown.</li>
      <li>Very neat product, very easy to use, not messy at all.  </li>
      <li>Right now I&#x27;m standing in my apartment, and I&#x27;m too embarrassed to go</li>
      <li>Fantastic new product!</li>
      <li>this product is pretty powerful and WILL STAIN.</li>
      <li>This morning I used Nice&#x27;n Easy foam 5rb (medium reddish brown) and after 22 minutes my hair was pitch black!  </li>
      <li>I anticipate more dye jobs to achieve perfection, and this is the only dye I will be using!</li>
      <li>My hair feels pretty smooth and soft regardless.    </li>
      <li>I divided my hair into bottom, middle, and top layers.</li>
      <li>The first squeeze comes out runny, but from then on it is the foam consistency advertised.</li>
      <li>The smell is somewhat potent, open windows for circulation</li>
      <li>One star is too many actually.  </li>
      <li>and today was my first time using this product.  </li>
      <li>My hair was nice an smooth, the highlights were subtle and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is very easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t drip like other liquid dyes.</li>
      <li>It also REALLY stained my skin and scalp, where I&#x27;ve never had such a problem before-even with the conventional Nice n Easy.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After the easy application I left the dye on for 25 minutes, then I rinsed out and applied the conditioner; others have said that their hair feels like straw</li>
      <li>I did not find any issue with smell nor burn, and I have super sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>I was only looking to cover the gray and not a drastic change, and this product made it easy to accomplish this.  </li>
      <li>I put this product on subscribe and save to make it easy to get it to me when I am ready for the next batch.  </li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t want to make it my personal fragrance or anything, but it was totally fine.</li>
      <li>I then read the Amazon reviews and got really nervous about using the product.</li>
      <li>You then squeeze the bottle from the middle, and a lightly colored foam comes out of the dispenser.</li>
      <li>I also thought that there was a really generous amount of product.</li>
      <li>I really like how my hair color turned out with this product</li>
      <li>I realize this is a bit counterintuitive, and the product looks really watery in the bottle, but stick with it.</li>
      <li>I really had to scrub to get it</li>
      <li>It has gotten light enough that I thought I would try to tone it myself.</li>
      <li>I really wish I had read the reviews.</li>
      <li>And I used number 9, light blonde.</li>
      <li>I think the people that had a problem with it being liquidy &amp; dripping may have shaken it too much.</li>
      <li>I have always been pleased with the results and this being the sole reason I carry in using this dye, it&#x27;s so convenient and quick and gives the colour that any other dye would.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
      <li>I also agree with several reviewers who said the smell was slightly sweet.</li>
      <li>The foam is non-drip and did not cause a mess, in fact, I think foam is my new favorite application texture.  </li>
      <li>Also, if any of the dye gets on to your skin then wipe it off with an old towel straight away, that&#x27;s what I did</li>
      <li>Follow the instructions carefully; shake mixture 3 times only; as you squeeze the bottle do not tilt it too much; don&#x27;t wait more than 25min, or the color will darken.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t live near a store &amp; REALLY needed to get my hair colored NOW.</li>
      <li>I usually leave my dyes on for a little extra time so they get darker, but I took this off at 25 minutes and it was perfect.</li>
      <li>I find it amazing that even in these tough economic times a company with a consumer name an repretation of Clairol would basically tell their unsuspecting customers that even though (through no fault of the customer)</li>
      <li>Live and learn.</li>
      <li>but I can assure you it turned out to be the extra light blonde</li>
      <li>Also, just a side note, the color doesn&#x27;t come out as a pretty white foam, mine was orange and that made me nervous to put it on my hair.</li>
      <li>However, I also saw a few people who had had good experiences, but said that the directions were a little off.</li>
      <li>I have never disliked a hair color product before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is quite messy -- more so than traditional applications.  </li>
      <li>I even asked my husband if my hair smelled weird, and he said it smelled good.  </li>
      <li>Overall, the color (Medium Golden Brown) turned out nice, but the hassle unfortunately makes me not want to use this product again.</li>
      <li>I will admit freely that it has a different smell, but it doesn&#x27;t linger after rinsing like other dyes do.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going back to the older version of the product.</li>
      <li>For me, this is often a problem with drugstore dyes, so although my hair is dark brown, I always go with Medium Golden Brown.</li>
      <li>It also does sting which is something that no other hair color seems to do.  </li>
      <li>I do have different tones that look natural.  </li>
      <li>I naturally have medium blonde hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Right now I&#x27;m standing in my apartment, and I&#x27;m too embarrassed to go out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Why?\\&quot; you ask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I wanted to buy the Clairol Perfect 10 hair color I like, but I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere except for Amazon, and I wanted to have it right away. I went to several supermarkets and pharmacies, but the Perfect 10 was gone. There wasn&#x27;t a single box on the shelves. Nada.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I saw this, and I figured, \\&quot;It&#x27;s also from Clairol. If they replaced Perfect 10 with this, it should be at least as good.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says it&#x27;s a drip-free foam, but the stuff still managed to get on my face and neck, even on the bathroom sink. And it doesn&#x27;t come off!! I tried wiping it off while I was coloring my hair, and I tried scrubbing it off with an exfoliant after I had finished coloring my hair--but I still have brown splotches on my face and neck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What the heck, Clairol??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now I can&#x27;t go out. I don&#x27;t know for how many days. I&#x27;m so upset, I could just scream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do. Not. Buy. This.</li>
    <li> I have been coloring my hair for around 20 years and have done my own hair many, many times. This was by FAR the WORST product I have ever used. In order for the foam to come out, you have to squeeze the bottle. Since I had gloves on, it became slippery and the bottle flew out of hands 3 times (one time it actually fell into the toilet!). I had black dye on my face and all over the bathroom. The smell was absolutely disgusting and it took at least a week before the stench went away. Also, the color did not match the box. Terrible!</li>
    <li> I have been dying my medium-length hair for 10+ years and today was my first time using this product.  The foam is non-drip and did not cause a mess, in fact, I think foam is my new favorite application texture.  I liked the way it saturated my hair, creating even coverage.  The box provides a conditioner and I left it on for about 5min before rinsing. My hair was nice an smooth, the highlights were subtle and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars because it smells and stains quite a bit--otherwise, very very pleased with the resulting hair color. Will use it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIPS:&lt;br /&gt;- Follow the instructions carefully; shake mixture 3 times only; as you squeeze the bottle do not tilt it too much; don&#x27;t wait more than 25min, or the color will darken.&lt;br /&gt;- The smell is somewhat potent, open windows for circulation&lt;br /&gt;- Before you dye your hair apply Vaseline/cold cream on hairline and ears-- this product is pretty powerful and WILL STAIN. I had some parts that got stained and had to use oil-based eye make up remover... I really had to scrub to get it off.&lt;br /&gt;- If you have a white bath tub washing your hair might stain it a little--- use some clorox toilet gel-- leave it for 10min-- it will just wash off.</li>
    <li> I  had been curious about foam/mousse dyes, and when I saw this on sale, I grabbed it. I then read the Amazon reviews and got really nervous about using the product. So many one star reviews! However, I also saw a few people who had had good experiences, but said that the directions were a little off. Thanks to  reviewer Sherry Zbar \\&quot;tap shoe\\&quot;, I ignored the written directions in the box and had very good results.   The key seems to be the mixing. Once you add the color and the developer, you just swirl three times, DON&#x27;T shake until fully mixed. I realize this is a bit counterintuitive, and the product looks really watery in the bottle, but stick with it. You then squeeze the bottle from the middle, and a lightly colored foam comes out of the dispenser. Again, looks are deceiving; this is not a pump. However, if you keep squeezing from the middle of the bottle, you get foam, down to the last drop. You then work the foam in like shampoo.  The biggest issues people seem to report are messiness, odor, and color, so here are my experiences in those areas:  MESSINESS: I have been dying my hair for 10 years, and this was the least messy product I have ever used. The bathroom cleanup was extremely minimal, and I did not have a lot of dripping. I did put Vaseline on my hairline ahead of time, though. I also thought that there was a really generous amount of product. I have thick hair that falls several inches below my shoulders, and I had plenty of foam color to go around,  ODOR: Having read all the horror stories, I was prepared for something nasty, but I opened my bathroom window and put the vent on, and it was just fine. There was a smell, but I don&#x27;t think it was anything worse than any other dye I have used. I also agree with several reviewers who said the smell was slightly sweet. I wouldn&#x27;t want to make it my personal fragrance or anything, but it was totally fine. After rinsing and conditioning, my hair smelled nice. I even asked my husband if my hair smelled weird, and he said it smelled good.  COLOR: Lots of people seem to feel that their color came out way too dark. For me, this is often a problem with drugstore dyes, so although my hair is dark brown, I always go with Medium Golden Brown. I also never leave color on for more than 15-20 minutes. Mind you, I&#x27;m just trying to cover greys and approximate my natural hair color, so this approach might not work for everyone. I always use the color on my hairline as a guide, and with this product I rinsed out after about 15 minutes. The results were excellent: good grey coverage, nice overall color, some highlights still visible. The conditioner is also very nice, and my hair came out very soft. However, I would recommend that you open the conditioner packet before you get in the shower, as it is not very perforated, and next-to-impossible to open with wet hands.  I can&#x27;t give the product 5 stars because of the unclear directions, however, I will defintely be using this again!  * It seem as if the company has modified the directions here in the Amazon listing, as you will see the \\&quot;3 shakes\\&quot; in the online directions. However, the directions that come in the box clearly tell you to shake until the product is mixed, and this seems to produce disastrous results.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. The foam was a total mess. It was runny and got on everything. Usually I can wipe my ears/neck/forehead with a paper towel afterward and not end up with stains, but I had to call in sick today because I can NOT get them off! It also has an unpleasant smell. I mean, hair dye doesn&#x27;t smell like roses, but this smells like urine. It came with two packets of conditioner, one for now and one for a week from now. I had to use both for the post-dye rinse, and I have a chin-length bob.   That said, I DO like the color. I usually leave my dyes on for a little extra time so they get darker, but I took this off at 25 minutes and it was perfect. I also like my browns a little reddish, and this is quite red. It&#x27;s a smooth take, shiny, and did well on the grays. However, I will not buy this foam-style again.</li>
    <li> This product obviously wasn&#x27;t tested by \\&quot;real\\&quot; people.  It is quite messy -- more so than traditional applications.  The foam went everywhere but I didn&#x27;t realize what I had colored until it showed up a several minutes later.      The color turned out darker than I expected.  Not a big deal as it will fade in a few days, but it is noticeably darker than previous color applications.      I cannot recommend this product.  It was a lot of work cleaning up the mess it made while coloring my hair.  Don&#x27;t buy it.  Stick to what works for you.  There&#x27;s a reason you like what you currently use.</li>
    <li> Fantastic new product! So easy to use and the results were GREAT! I&#x27;m not crazy about coloring my hair at home, and this product has changed my mind. Will use it again and again in the future!</li>
    <li> I bought the foam on clearance, (now I know why!),in med golden brown. My hair was dyed a shade lighter than medium brown and the color came out spotty, almost black in some areas &amp; a dark golden brown in others. Looking like a skunk is Clairol&#x27;s interpretation of highlights and lowlights because that is how my hair turned out. The dye rinsed out ok but I was left with hard hair even after I deep conditioned it with keratin conditioner. I went to my salon &amp; my stylist thought I had left the color in for an hour because my hair was so fried! I will not recommend this to a friend or use it again. I&#x27;ll stick to Loreal&#x27;s Preference or Excellence. Their colors are accurate and my hair is always soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to leave negative feedback about this dye on their website and they didn&#x27;t publish it! They don&#x27;t stand by their word or products at all.</li>
    <li> I have to admit, I was excited to try this foam. The first thing I noticed was the horrible smell. It actually does smell pretty bad, and I did not get used to the smell at all. It was a little harder to use than I thought. I have really thick long hair, and I was told I only needed to use one bottle. I normally have to buy two bottles of the other brands. It was a little difficult to cover my entire head. I waited the 25 minutes as directed. When I finished rinsing and conditioning, I dried my hair and I noticed that the product was a lot darker than I thought it would be. I naturally have medium blonde hair. And I used number 9, light blonde. And my hair came out darker than it was before. I am disappointed with the color. I was just trying to touch up where my hair had grown out. I will continue to use my favorite product, Loreal no drip formula.</li>
    <li> I did not read the reviews before I bought this.  I have been coloring my hair myself for many years and have never had a worse experience than this one.  One star is too many actually.  That&#x27;s how bad it is.  I got a \\&quot;great deal\\&quot; on this as they are promoting it a lot.  The smell is really, really bad.  Then there is the mess - the fluffy foam in the picture is really drippy and brown.  It is very difficult to accurately apply to your temples and hairline, so you end up with skin that is stained a very dark brown.  It also does sting which is something that no other hair color seems to do.  I really wish I had read the reviews.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve dyed my hair plenty of times, all with no problems. With the nice n easy foam (Only purchased because i had a one box free coupon) it really \\&quot;tingled\\&quot; when it went on, and my head is still itchy 12+ hours after using it. It also REALLY stained my skin and scalp, where I&#x27;ve never had such a problem before-even with the conventional Nice n Easy. The application was super easy, but I won&#x27;t be using this again.</li>
    <li> Despite what others are saying, I really liked this hair color. I have a horror story (which many women do) concerning hair color. My stylist has been determined for some time to make me a red head despite my consistent \\&quot;no.\\&quot; I have been growing out my natural dark blonde and went to her to tone down the brassiness from a previous dye job. Instead, she took it upon herself to dye my hair a dark copper. Without my consent. Needless to say, I was a little traumatized. For a couple of weeks now I have been shampooing with Prell everyday trying to fade it. It has gotten light enough that I thought I would try to tone it myself. Knowing that my ends would soak up color like a sponge, I went for a Medium Ash Blonde instead of Dark Ash to start.     Using this color is a very simple process. The key is to only shake the foam bottle to mix about 3 times. ONLY 3! NO MORE! The first squeeze comes out runny, but from then on it is the foam consistency advertised. I divided my hair into bottom, middle, and top layers. It is very easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t drip like other liquid dyes. I will admit freely that it has a different smell, but it doesn&#x27;t linger after rinsing like other dyes do. (You know how you can smell it all day after? This isn&#x27;t like that. My boyfriend is nodding emphatically at this comment.) As with most dyes, be sure to ventilate the room! The conditioner included seems to work well, but I usually try to deep condition and use Argan and Macadamia oil regularly in preparation for dye jobs that will damage. My hair feels pretty smooth and soft regardless.    My hair is not a perfect red-free blonde, but it certainly has toned it down from its previous brightness to a pretty auburn. I anticipate more dye jobs to achieve perfection, and this is the only dye I will be using!</li>
    <li> CAREFUL the new foam is UNPREDICTABLE &amp; Clairol does not stand behind their product!  In fact I doubt that they even tested the product sufficiently before bringing it to market.  I have been coloring my hair for years and years using a competitor&#x27;s product and have never had any problems.  This morning I used Nice&#x27;n Easy foam 5rb (medium reddish brown) and after 22 minutes my hair was pitch black!  I called the customer service line and the only solution that they offered was to strip the color from my hair and then re-color with another nice&#x27;n easy product.  When I told the rep that I was afraid to use 2 more processes on recently colored hair (I figure this would damange my hair and even perhaps make it fall out of my head!!)- he told me that perhaps I should go to a hair salon to have it done - at my expense of cause!  I find it amazing that even in these tough economic times a company with a consumer name an repretation of Clairol would basically tell their unsuspecting customers that even though (through no fault of the customer) their product worked in a awful and unexpected manner- The CUSTOMER IS ON THEIR OWN.  CLAIROL WILL NOT DO ONE THING TO RECTIFY THE SITUATION THAT THEY CAUSED.</li>
    <li> I really like how my hair color turned out with this product, it&#x27;s darker than I expected, but I still like it. Two things I do not like about this hair dye: 1. It smells really bad. When I was applying the color on my hair, my husband could smell it all the way out in the living room and asked me if I was pouring beer on my hair. 2. This stuff is SO messy. I took my time with the application and yet I still ended up with dye all over my ears and forehead, down my arms and on my neck. Also, just a side note, the color doesn&#x27;t come out as a pretty white foam, mine was orange and that made me nervous to put it on my hair. Overall, the color (Medium Golden Brown) turned out nice, but the hassle unfortunately makes me not want to use this product again.</li>
    <li> I am a total novice at this and it was my first attempt to dye my own hair.  I feel blessed that I did not read the other (bad) reviews before, as I would have never tried it.  I did not find any issue with smell nor burn, and I have super sensitive skin.  The product did foam as expected, and did not drip in the hair.  Directions were a piece of cake, and I was careful to follow them.  Not sure how others did not get foam, but perhaps they did not gently shake only the specified 3 times?  The color is as expected and the gray is covered completely.  I do have different tones that look natural.  The husband didn&#x27;t even realize when he made it home tonight that it was changed- perfect :0)  I was only looking to cover the gray and not a drastic change, and this product made it easy to accomplish this.  I put this product on subscribe and save to make it easy to get it to me when I am ready for the next batch.  Goodbye gray!</li>
    <li> I normally buy the regular Clairol Nice n Easy Light Brown or Golden Medium Brown, but I had a coupon for this product, and it was on sale.  It was fairly easy to use, but very irritating to my scalp.  It burned on application, and my scalp still itches!  Also, the color is way too dark.  This product is supposed to be Light Brown, but my hair is very dark brown, now, almost black, with no highlights.  So, now I&#x27;m on the web trying to find out to lighten up hair that is dyed too dark.  Never again... I&#x27;m going back to the older version of the product.</li>
    <li> I was afraid to use this product after reading the reviews, but decided to try it bc I don&#x27;t live near a store &amp; REALLY needed to get my hair colored NOW. I think the people that had a problem with it being liquidy &amp; dripping may have shaken it too much. Also, most of the reviews were written a couple years ago &amp; perhaps Clairol has made some changes for the better; I couldn&#x27;t find any type of date on the box or instructions. I don&#x27;t think it had an unpleasant smell &amp; it didn&#x27;t sting or burn my scalp. I thought it was very easy to use &amp; the foam made for more even color distribution. I used to dread coloring my hair, but I will use this foam from now on.</li>
    <li> This was the messiest dye I&#x27;ve ever used.  I also thought the foam would be nice, but it splashed all over the place, it did get on my skin and I didn&#x27;t even know it (don&#x27;t wear my glasses while dying my hair so I couldn&#x27;t see it!).  My hair is way too dark, too, and I bought Medium Brown, not Black!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will never use the foam again, it also had too strong a smell, but I like the scent of the conditioner, that was the only good thing about this product.  I have never disliked a hair color product before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and it didn&#x27;t do a good job at all on the stubborn grays and I left it on well over 35 minutes.  I started using Avon&#x27;s Hair Color when it came out and I just forgot to order it for this week&#x27;s color session and am I sorry!  Avon&#x27;s got it all over this terrible product!  Very neat product, very easy to use, not messy at all.  Live and learn.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews of this product after using it and I would like to say that I did not experience anything which most of the reviews have said to have happened.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the foam does act like a foam if you follow the instructions. You&#x27;re supposed to only shake it three times and leave it to settle for about a minute, this will ensure that what you get out is a foam (I have used this product multiple times and I have never had a runny liquid which gets everywhere) On the multiple occasions where I have used the foam if was definitely non-drip, I even held in upside down to check it wasn&#x27;t runny and it did not drip at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the smell is not that bad, I found it to be tolerable and having used other dyes, I couldn&#x27;t really tell much difference in terms of smell.(I would also like to add that you shouldn&#x27;t be alarmed by the initial colour of the foam in the bottle, for me it was red but I can assure you it turned out to be the extra light blonde I purchased)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further more, the \\&quot;burning\\&quot; is nothing more than a slight itching sensation, which again was tolerable and not as bad as others have stated. Also, if any of the dye gets on to your skin then wipe it off with an old towel straight away, that&#x27;s what I did and I found no problems. It wasn&#x27;t the dye, it was the I was clumsy in the application of it. (The foam is so easy to apply, I can apply it without the help of others with normal dyes and does not get everywhere, just make sure the bottle is held upright and you should be fine!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the easy application I left the dye on for 25 minutes, then I rinsed out and applied the conditioner; others have said that their hair feels like straw but I can honestly say that my hair feels soft and glossy and I am writing this the morning after I applied it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the colour. For me the colour was great, I used extra light blonde and I am very happy with the results, obviously I cannot say anything about the brown colours as I have never used th but I am very happy with the blonde colours. (I have used most of them)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My feeling for this product are very positive! I have always been pleased with the results and this being the sole reason I carry in using this dye, it&#x27;s so convenient and quick and gives the colour that any other dye would.&lt;br /&gt;My final comment on this product would be to follow the instructions, that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re there for! From reading these reviews I can see hat it seems the people who continuously shake the foam aren&#x27;t pleased with the results. All I can say is, I followed the instructions to the latter and I am pleased with the results.</li>
