      <li>All in all, a good toothbrush that does the job.</li>
      <li>but it works good.  </li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t think that could be good for it.</li>
      <li>wise</li>
      <li>Its good.  </li>
      <li>Seems to do a good job.</li>
      <li>I must have gotten a good brush...</li>

      <li>Very satisfied.</li>
      <li>great product at a great economical price</li>
      <li>I love this toothbrush!</li>
      <li>It just feels like its working better and at about 1/10th the price!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s battery operated; so I don&#x27;t need cords of any kind to use it.</li>
      <li>am very HAPPY with the service, I received these in a very timely manner and they were packaged&lt;br /&gt;great.</li>
      <li>This one is noiser, but good and strong.  </li>
      <li>What&#x27;s even better is the replaceable brushheads as to where u can save even more $!  </li>
      <li>He doesn&#x27;t treat his in any special way, so it looks like it&#x27;s just a roll of the dice as to whether or not you get a good brush.</li>
      <li>The first one was great for a while, but water got into the battery compartment and caused the batteries to leak.  </li>
      <li>The massaging rotations of the bristles are also very comfortable for my gum line, which I think I tend to abuse with a manual toothbrush.</li>
      <li>So when you buy this item; make sure to also order a pack of replacement heads.</li>
      <li>Love these toothbrushes.</li>
      <li>It did the job for me, and I felt I was getting my teeth and gums more thoroughly cleaned than with a manual toothbrush.</li>
      <li>and we love them.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d go with something a bit more sturdy, even if it costs more.</li>
      <li>It is a bit noisy but that&#x27;s okay</li>
      <li>Cleans my teeth better than any brush I have used before.</li>
      <li>my daughter recieved a crest spinbrush for christmas and she claimed that it was the best brush ever 5 months later, comparing her experience to going to the dentist for a cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Glad</li>
      <li>I love my spinbrush pro.</li>
      <li>I love the spin brush.</li>
      <li>There are better brands of electric toothbrush out there.</li>
      <li>I love this toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>Bought an Oral-B Pulsar today, hopefully that will work out better.</li>
      <li>Makes me teeth feel fabulous!</li>
      <li>For effectiveness at cleaning, I&#x27;d give it 4-5 stars, as it seems to clean more effectively and quicker than brushing alone; however, brushing for a longer period of time would probably get close to the effectiveness of the spinbrush.  </li>
      <li>but they still do a pretty good job.</li>
      <li>Mine lasted for exactly 3 uses, and I loved it</li>
      <li>These are great for the price, its allot better then spending the 60 dollars or more for the same thing.</li>
      <li>My brother has had a battery-powered toothbrush for years, and I always made fun of him for being so technologically trendy.  </li>
      <li>Fast service and good quality</li>
      <li>The brush does spin quite fast and with a fair amount of power.    </li>
      <li>If you plan on buying one of these and are switching from a manual brush, be warned that the vibrating takes some getting used to, but is easily overcome.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong).</li>
      <li>When I first got this toothbrush, I really liked it.</li>
      <li>I like the spinner feature, really gets teeth clean and gets the gumline good too.  </li>
      <li>I tend to stir up a lot of drool whilst brushing, and with drool and toothpaste dribbling down my front and sometimes splattering my surroundings, it seemed best to make this a part of my shower ritual.</li>
      <li>Now if this was maybe 2 or 3 months it would be fine, except for one factor:&lt;br /&gt;THEY</li>
      <li>it is still working fine.</li>
      <li>Fine toothbrush..</li>
      <li>I love the way they work, but they break too quickly.</li>
      <li>Aside form this problem,I liked the toothbrush a lot but certainly can&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
      <li>With the Spinbrush I have to remember that I need to count 120 seconds which may not always be accurate because my mind tends to wander...</li>
      <li>It works, it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
      <li>I think the whitening aspect may be a gimmick, but I would still recommend this for a cheap electric toothbrush that you can buy replacement heads for.</li>
      <li>NONE of my rechargables fit, rayovac AA nimh, eneloop nimh AA, etc...  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t speak for the rechargeable system also available from Arm and Hammer buy</li>
      <li>I was happy to find the same thing.</li>
      <li>Works really well and gives a nice clean feeling</li>
      <li>It is very great at cleaning every tooth completely and yet inexpensive enough that if you forget it while traveling you can easily replace it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is quite a shame, because as a toothbrush, it does a decent job and leaves my teeth feeling nice and clean.</li>
      <li>This seems more of a disposable toothbrush that should be thrown away once the first set of batteries die.</li>
      <li>I use it every day and it worth the money!</li>
      <li>In this regard, this spin brush is great for kids who don&#x27;t like to brush for very long.  </li>
      <li>It does keep my teeth clean though.  </li>
      <li>Makes Ur mouth feel clean.</li>
      <li>It meant not feeling like my teeth were completely clean.</li>
      <li>it worth its price, easy to use.</li>
      <li>However, until the company either supplies the o-ring replacements or, better yet, develops a new design for the battery compartment, I would strongly discourage people from buying this product.</li>
      <li>I have had this for over a month and it makes it much easier and creates more confidence in doing a thorough brushing job.</li>
      <li>the amazon price is so good that the price of one spinbrush is comparable to two regular brushes from the market.  </li>
      <li>The ones that only vibrate don&#x27;t do as good a job.</li>
      <li>Worth the cheap price</li>
      <li>the water) but other than that its a great brush.</li>
      <li>this paticular brand lies flat no prob, and the med bristles last longer and clean best imo.</li>
      <li>SpinBrush is powerful and leaves my teeth feeling clean after use.</li>
      <li>Get the Oral-B. A much better buy, only one battery needed and better quality.</li>
      <li>It seems that water somehow got into the battery compartment and quickly corroded the electronics.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this type of tooth brush for years and have never had one stop this quickly.</li>
      <li>They can rightly boast that it gives you a clean cleansing</li>
      <li>This toothbrush may say medium, but I found it is kind of soft and very gentle on my gums, hence no bleeding gums anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love my new Spinbrush.</li>
      <li>I now have the Oral B electric toothbrush and found it to be very welled designed, water proof, battery is easy to replaced.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> very good toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I use it every day and it worth the money!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I have used Spin Brush for about two years,&lt;br /&gt;I am very HAPPY with the service, I received these in a very timely manner and they were packaged&lt;br /&gt;great.</li>
    <li> Its good.  Hard to get excited about a toothbrush but it works good.  Its the item I expected. I would buy again</li>
    <li> Disappointed that this has already stopped working.  I&#x27;ve used this type of tooth brush for years and have never had one stop this quickly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these for a couple years, the heads are extremely hard to find, but I&#x27;ve got 11 of them stashed so far. I might buy this brush as a backup in case the motor/battery end dies. Protip: Energizer lithium AA&#x27;s will supercharge it&#x27;s small motor, and wont break it(at least not in 2 years, so far).</li>
    <li> cleans my teeth. was a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Fast service and good quality</li>
    <li> This toothbrush lasted all of three weeks.  Water gets into the battery compartment and ruins the batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money for an Oral-B toothbrush.</li>
    <li> After my Oral-B battery brush finally died, I decided to try the Crest brand battery brush. Big mistake! First of all, it took 3 different people to finally get the battery cover off to replace the two batteries. I used cooking oil on the plastic parts so it would come off easier the next time the batteries needed replacement. That did help, although I was surprised how quickly this would be necessary.    The brush does spin quite fast and with a fair amount of power.    Compared to the Oral-B, this is a poor design....plus it uses 2 batteries instead of one.    Get the Oral-B. A much better buy, only one battery needed and better quality.</li>
    <li> For effectiveness at cleaning, I&#x27;d give it 4-5 stars, as it seems to clean more effectively and quicker than brushing alone; however, brushing for a longer period of time would probably get close to the effectiveness of the spinbrush.  In this regard, this spin brush is great for kids who don&#x27;t like to brush for very long.  I have trouble getting my kids to brush for 2 minutes, they tend to brush for 1 min or less and with this spin brush, they do seem to get a better clean in that amount of time than they would with a manual toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the problem with the spin brush:  The replacement heads are about ~$10 for a two pack.  For that price, I decided that I will do my brushing with a manual brush and brush for a longer period of time to get about the same cleaning effect.  For kids who generally tend to be impatient, this product is great!  Just be prepared for the high price of the replacement heads.</li>
    <li> I bought this toothbrush because I was looking for one that was not a kids toy. I have no basis for how it should work because I have never had anything quite like this.  Basing my selection on past purchases, I expected to have a similar experience with this brush. I like the design and the coverage area of the brushes (the last one that I got seemed to have been made of rubber. But, once you manage to turn it on it acts like a jackhammer (bone jarring) in your mouth.  I looked for some way to see if I could turn it down but no go.  I am now afraid to use it because I am afraid that I will lose tooth enamel because it seems much too strong for its purpose. They can rightly boast that it gives you a clean cleansing but I feel that with continued use one might also wind up with a cleam mouth.</li>
    <li> After using oral b for some time, this toothbrush was a pleasant surprise. SpinBrush is powerful and leaves my teeth feeling clean after use. I would recommend this product to anyone who prefers a battery operated toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I must have gotten a good brush...I have had mine for over a year now, close to the 2 yr mark too...yes you read correctly...I have had not a problem with mine. I must be lucky then based a the very many poor reviews this product got. I keep mine in a cup that we have in our bathroom, our cup doesnt have weep holes in it so sometimes when I forget to pour out the water the bottom of my brush is in water....it is still working fine. My only problem is that the rubber on my switch got moldy looking...(from the water) but other than that its a great brush.</li>
    <li> I have owned quite a few battery powered or rechargeable toothbrushes and this is definitely the worst.&lt;br /&gt;It has, in my opinion, two big problems: the fact that it is not waterproof and the annoying ability it has to go through many, many batteries very fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Spinbrush&#x27;s consumes a lot: I brush my teeth three times a day and a set of batteries only last about two weeks. I am not sure if it is defective, but it would certainly be expensive in the long run. Please note that I used &#x27;would&#x27; and not &#x27;will&#x27;. I don&#x27;t expect this toothbrush to survive as it is certainly not waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;I use the term waterproof loosely here, because I don&#x27;t mean that you can&#x27;t take it into the shower and use it there, or that water will get into it if you drop it in a bathtub full of water -that would be asking a lot. What I mean is that, during normal toothbrushing activities water collects into the battery case quite easily and quickly.&lt;br /&gt;If you are very careful you can empty it, dry the batteries, leave the toothbrush open and let it dry, but it is a bit of a pain if you ask me (and the case is also hard to open, which doesn&#x27;t make things easier).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is quite a shame, because as a toothbrush, it does a decent job and leaves my teeth feeling nice and clean. Unfortunately the two big cons make it a tool I would not recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Its an alright toothbrush but for the money its worth it</li>
    <li> I like these toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> didnt even work when I first put batteries in it. I had one that I used for years and when it died I figured just to get the same thing again. WRONG! now I have to replace it again cause it was pointless.</li>
    <li> I have had this for over a month and it makes it much easier and creates more confidence in doing a thorough brushing job.</li>
    <li> Seems to do a good job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought two of these tooth brushes and both have had the same problem: the battery compartment.  The black o-ring within the battery compartment is the cause of the trouble.  It either prevents the proper closure of the battery compartment, as other reviews have noted, or it eventually breaks entirely, allowing even more moisture inside.  I&#x27;ve tried to find that particular o-ring in hardware stores, the Crest website, and elsewhere, but have not succeeded.  If Crest would make them available, these units might last a lot longer.  When they work properly, I really like these brushes, which is why I bought a second. However, until the company either supplies the o-ring replacements or, better yet, develops a new design for the battery compartment, I would strongly discourage people from buying this product.</li>
    <li> I guess you really get what you pay for with this \\&quot;powered\\&quot; tooth brush.  It stays powered for about 2 brushing sessions, and then for the next 10 you think this is the last time - it is going to die mid brush. When it dies mid brush and you have half of your mouth all nice and brushed and a mouth full of paste.  Then you are forced to use something else to finish the job.  I bought 2 replacement heads at the same time.  The next day I had to buy a 20 count battery pack.  Cheaper than buying a new \\&quot;powered\\&quot; brush.  I just hope they last me through the 2 additional heads.  All that said... that isn&#x27;t the worst of it.  It pinches my tongue and cheek, I thought I just needed to learn how to avoid that, but now 3 months into it, this morning I had 5 pinches.</li>
    <li> My brother has had a battery-powered toothbrush for years, and I always made fun of him for being so technologically trendy.  Then my mom came home with a Spinbrush Pro Whitening for me, and I have to say that I really like using it.  Though I can&#x27;t debate the reviews from users whose brushes died after three or four months, I&#x27;ve been using my brush for a couple months now without any problems.  It leaves my teeth looking whiter, though not as white as tooth whitening gel does, and best of all, my teeth feel super slick and clean.  The massaging rotations of the bristles are also very comfortable for my gum line, which I think I tend to abuse with a manual toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Better than most other brands including Oral B.</li>
    <li> It worked great for about 3 or 4 weeks, then it just went dead...  Now if this was maybe 2 or 3 months it would be fine, except for one factor:&lt;br /&gt;THEY MARKET IT WITH REMOVABLE HEADS AND BATTERIES. Why pretend that the product is sustainable if it isn&#x27;t? I didn&#x27;t abuse the toothbrush in anyway and barley got any water on it (although thats what toothbrushes do) and it still broke..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opened it up and tried to replace the batteries and I could smell that the motor burnt out. Bought an Oral-B Pulsar today, hopefully that will work out better. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
    <li> Mine lasted for exactly 3 uses, and I loved it but then it died. I changed the batteries but it still doesn&#x27;t work. Complete garbage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Spinbrushes for over 3yrs. They preform excellently. Makes Ur mouth feel clean. Batteries last between 4-6 months. U should change brush heads every 3-4 months as instructed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love Using my spinbrush</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the on/off button is hard to use, especially when hands are wet.  Would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have bought two of these brushes. I love the way they work, but they break too quickly. Neither one of them has lasted longer than three months (the package says to replace the heads every three to four months...think about it) The first one was great for a while, but water got into the battery compartment and caused the batteries to leak.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I blamed it on myself and went out to buy a new one. I was extra careful not to get the bottom wet, which is interesting to do considering it is a product that is made to be used around water. Not to be disgusting, but how do you rinse off your saliva without getting it wet??? This second one lasted a little bit longer than the first one, but now I have an interesting problem where I cannot get the battery compartment to fit back inside the brush! Even with the batteries not inside it, the compartment will not snap all the way in. If it&#x27;s not closed, it won&#x27;t run, and water would be able to get inside anyway.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The following are points to consider, on their own they would not bother me but I&#x27;ll mention them anyway: &lt;br /&gt;-The battery compartment, when working, is a little difficult to get open.  &lt;br /&gt;-On the first brush I had no problem getting the power switch to slide up with wet hands, but on the second brush the switch went considerably harder and I need to put my hand inside a towel to turn the brush on.  &lt;br /&gt;-As far as it&#x27;s whitening properties, I don&#x27;t know if it does that, I&#x27;ve never paid attention. It does keep my teeth clean though.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, my boyfriend bought his at the same time that I bought my first one, and his is still going strong. He doesn&#x27;t treat his in any special way, so it looks like it&#x27;s just a roll of the dice as to whether or not you get a good brush. I&#x27;m not taking that chance any more, the next brush will be a different brand. I&#x27;d rather buy a more expensive brush that lasts a long time than a cheap one that I have to replace every 3 months.</li>
    <li> my daughter recieved a crest spinbrush for christmas and she claimed that it was the best brush ever 5 months later, comparing her experience to going to the dentist for a cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so i got one.  and i too am impressed.  neither of us are experiencing the problems i read here.  both brushes remain in operable condition and show no sign of wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and the amazon price is so good that the price of one spinbrush is comparable to two regular brushes from the market.  today i am buying replacement heads for both my daughter and myself.  when the brush(es) tanks, i will be back to buy more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**update**&lt;br /&gt;three months later and all is still well.  both brushes work superbly and do not seem to have the problems others mention with leaks and so forth.  working as designed.  -bw 7.28.08</li>
    <li> This is by far the worst toothbrush I have ever used. I just does not last. After 3 months of using it the brush barely works. A put new batteries into the thing every week and a half. That does not seem normal. In addition, when I remove them they are all rusty and wet. It is also difficult to replace the batteries because the cap that closes the battery compartment does not close and I have to use WD 40 every time I try to access the battery compartment. How could Crest put their name on such a bad product fools me. They make great paste but horrible brushes. They need to get back to the drawing table for this one. I usually don&#x27;t write reviews of products but this product infuriated me to no end. The only reason I give it 2 stars is because it worked well for the first 2 months. This seems more of a disposable toothbrush that should be thrown away once the first set of batteries die. Crest should just put batteries in the brush and seal the compartment so that it is not user accessible, that way the brush would be thrown away when it should be and avoid hassles for the customers who try to figure out how to close the battery compartment when it fails to close properly. What a waste!!</li>
    <li> Have used the Spinbrush for years.  My dentist says whatever I am doing, keep on because I have had no cavities, very little plaque. They also last a very long time.</li>
    <li> I thought I was getting my 7 yr old a cheap electronic toothbrush, just for the heck of giving it a try.  To my extreme delight he now gives much less trouble to brush his teeth, he does a more thorough job of it since the head is also so hard at work, and although I expected the brush to conk out in no time (it costs so little, I had low expectations) it&#x27;s been months and I still haven&#x27;t even had to replace the battery!    Time to get one for myself.  I recommend with 2 thumbs up.</li>
    <li> Impressive brush for the price.</li>
    <li> Cleans my teeth better than any brush I have used before.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as described, and saved $$$ ordering through Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always preferred the Spinbrush toothbrushes over the high dollar Sonicare ones.. I&#x27;d rather have the brush spin than just vibrate. It just feels like its working better and at about 1/10th the price!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, and not worth even the cheap price.  I&#x27;d go with something a bit more sturdy, even if it costs more.</li>
    <li> Works really well and gives a nice clean feeling</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these &amp;#34;el-cheapo&amp;#34; electric toothbrushes for years. My dental hygienist says, &amp;#34;Whatever you&#x27;re doing, keep doing it.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just remember to always get the ones with the rotating and back-and-forth head. The ones that only vibrate don&#x27;t do as good a job.</li>
    <li> it worth its price, easy to use. I like it very much. I definately consider to recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> Worth the cheap price</li>
    <li> I used a more expensive competitors&lt;br /&gt;Toothbrush for two years and constantly found myself left with cavities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The large brush size on this toothbrush has really changed the game!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last two trips since switching, I am the picture of perfect oral health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 star deducted for not being rechargable!</li>
    <li> I wanted Medium brush, they sent soft</li>
    <li> As always my favorite tooth brush :)!!!</li>
    <li> I bought it to replace my older toothbrush bought 4 years ago. I was happy to find the same thing.</li>
    <li> These things work great without breaking the bank.  No point in buying the ones in the store that look like something your dentist would have in their basement.  What&#x27;s even better is the replaceable brushheads as to where u can save even more $!  About the only negative here is the batteries sometimes get corroded, which can be messy &amp; hard to remove.</li>
    <li> Buy the generic replaceable heads.&lt;br /&gt;Do your toelifts while you brush and you should get to 150 in two minutes without bouncing.  I dare you!</li>
    <li> This is one loud toothbrush.  I&#x27;m pretty sure I have no enamel left on my teeth after using this product.  It is not for the faint of heart.  This is a case where I should have invested in a Sonic instead.</li>
    <li> When I first got this toothbrush, I really liked it. It did the job for me, and I felt I was getting my teeth and gums more thoroughly cleaned than with a manual toothbrush. Then a few months passed, and water seeped into the battery compartment. The batteries were corroded (ruined) and the toothbrush no longer worked. Now let&#x27;s think about this for a minute: a toothbrush is regularly exposed to what? Anyone? Anyone? Bueller? Yes, a toothbrush is regularly exposed to water. So a toothbrush that contains batteries should have what built into it? Yes, a barrier that keeps the water from getting into the inner mechanism of the toothbrush. The Spinbrush Pro lacks such a barrier, and therefore will eventually get fouled by water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did the manufacturer not know that their device would be regularly exposed to water? I&#x27;d suggest you look for something that is a bit more expensive (one time) but does not require replacement on a regular basis. That&#x27;s cheaper in the long run.</li>
    <li> I bought the Spinbrush because I needed an electric toothbrush right away and couldn&#x27;t wait for one to be shipped from online, this is just what they had in the local pharmacy. So this review is a comparison between Arm and Hammer&#x27;s Spinbrush and Oral B&#x27;s Dual Vitality by Braun. I have to say Spinbrush falls short for me. The heads were medium but I felt like it was soft. The vibrating mechanism didn&#x27;t seem as powerful to me next to the Oral B perhaps that has something to do with the fact that the Spinbrush isn&#x27;t a rechargeable battery. It meant not feeling like my teeth were completely clean. Also I think I&#x27;m spoiled by the fact that the Oral B has a timer for 2 minutes (I&#x27;ve been using the Braun device for 5 years and it&#x27;s still going strong). With the Spinbrush I have to remember that I need to count 120 seconds which may not always be accurate because my mind tends to wander...brushing one&#x27;s teeth can be a really mindless chore.&lt;br /&gt;Design wise I don&#x27;t like the sliding power button. I prefer one to depress. The handle itself can become very slippery and difficult to grab/switch off the device while brushing one&#x27;s teeth. By the laws of physics and gravity all that froth will go downwards...The head is a bit tricky to twist off and even though I do rinse out the inside as well, the brush still leaves a puddle of white remnants of toothpaste that leak from the head when placed horizontal on the bathroom sink. The area to replace the battery is also difficult to open but I suppose they really wanted to make that part impervious to water leaking in.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s a functional toothbrush. It works, it&#x27;s cheap. There are better brands of electric toothbrush out there. This device kinda sails through the middle for me.</li>
    <li> I love the spin brush. I&#x27;ve used it for years. Lasts for awhile and with replacement heads and new batteries you can&#x27;t kill it.</li>
    <li> While I was out shopping in a local store, I spotted this Spinbrush with medium bristles. At the time, I did not realize that it was a medium bristle until I went home and opened the package. However, since I was coming from soft or very soft bristles, I decided to brush my teeth more gently and let this toothbrush do all of the work. It does have a rather large toothbrush head, yet this is good because it cleans all areas of all of my teeth, even those hard to reach places in the back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results after using this brush: My teeth were very clean and cleaner than my old soft manual toothbrush! Felt like I had just gone to the dentist for a cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;Also, this brush removes plaque and tartar much better than my old manual brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Special thing for you to know: I have gingivitis and if I brush too hard or use a medium or hard toothbrush, my gums bleed. Not good. This toothbrush may say medium, but I found it is kind of soft and very gentle on my gums, hence no bleeding gums anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this toothbrush to all!</li>
    <li> If you get it wet it stops working, which is quite ironic given its a toothbrush. If you want something to work for a month or two its fine, otherwise avoid it entirely. I intitally thought the water was effecting the battery compartment but after cleaing the contacts and replacing the batteries it seems clear to me that the motor fails due to moisture, pretty quickly after ordinary use.</li>
    <li> I love the brush, and can see a big difference in my dental hygiene.  The price was reasonable, and the replacement brushes are also well priced.</li>
    <li> Great price for the $$$</li>
    <li> I saw lots of really nice reviewing comparing to the more expensive toothbrush like sonic care. Let me tell you, the power is no where near a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; the sonic care. It went into the garbage on the first try.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes -- I usually buy the &amp;#34;Spinbursh Pro&amp;#34; -- don&#x27;t think the whitening is that effective, but the plain old one was not available. No difference otherwise, and these brushes do a great job along with the flossing all dentists recommend. I am a bit of a spendthrift about these brushes, though. The battery cover is hard to deal with. When the batteries die, I throw away the whole brush and open a new one. Heck -- it&#x27;s a lot cheaper than periodontia surgery!</li>
    <li> Nice little brush that ones with the battery. It is a bit noisy but that&#x27;s okay I am only brushing my teeth</li>
    <li> I like these brushes because they don&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg like others but they still do a pretty good job. I&#x27;ve had this one for a few months now and its great. Batteries last forever. I had one like this before just an older version or non whitening, and it lasted for over 15 months. Just replace the heads when necessary. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t remember what &#x27;stiffness&#x27; of brush I had on my old Spinbrush so I ordered one with Medium bristles. These are too stiff for me and hurt my gums so I&#x27;ll be ordering some Soft replacement tips.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful dental care appliance, and having wore out a number of them over the past several years, I can attest to their quality and longevity. Being handicapped, I find that using mine is much easier in the shower. I tend to stir up a lot of drool whilst brushing, and with drool and toothpaste dribbling down my front and sometimes splattering my surroundings, it seemed best to make this a part of my shower ritual. No one will think the worst of you for slinging spit in the shower-if you&#x27;re alone, that is.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00027CCCU Sprinbrush Pro Whitening Battery Powered Toothbrush, Medium (Colors May Vary)]]</li>
    <li> Horrible toothbrush! The motor is so powerful that turning it on instant sends all of the toothpaste flying! It gets all over the bathroom and whatever clothes I&#x27;m wearing. The on/off switch is so tough to move that half the time I just use it as a manual toothbrush (I am an athletic 20something male, if I have trouble with it I feel bad for those with arthritis!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I initially bought this toothbrush because it can stand on its own and my old OralB could not. I also generally like Arm and Hammer products.  I&#x27;ve never had this problem with OralB products - I guess I&#x27;m going back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just avoid this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I love my new Spinbrush. I usually use manual toothbrushes but decided to change to a battery operated brush. I choose this one because I don&#x27;t like the soft brush ones. They don&#x27;t seem to clean very well to me</li>
    <li> I am  very very very happy with this and i recommened this to anyone who like this type of thing.</li>
    <li> Love these toothbrushes. We don&#x27;t have to replace the bodies until about 18 months use. I imagine you can overdo it and cause damage if you use it too long per brushing.</li>
    <li> a great way to brush your teeth without a lot of effort.  This toothbrush is battery powered and it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I have used a Spinbrush for years, and bought this one as a backup to use if my present one ever gives up the ghost. Very economical, and it has even impressed my dentist! Mine is loaded with the silver &amp; blue lithium Eveready batteries and they really make the brush honk! They last an incredibly long time too, for being NON-rechargable. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I like the spinner feature, really gets teeth clean and gets the gumline good too.  I tossed my old one without it right away.  This one is noiser, but good and strong.  I bought the refills at the same time, since It is hard to find them, if you try to find them at the store later.</li>
    <li> Good.  Doesn&#x27;t reach back teeth very well.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted. Has good speed and the medium brush is firm enough to make your teeth feel clean and polished.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied. No problems.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush! It is very great at cleaning every tooth completely and yet inexpensive enough that if you forget it while traveling you can easily replace it. I buy the &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; for the kids &amp; &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; for me.</li>
    <li> It does work well when you get it. I use it once a day (regular brushes the other times) because I worry about whether it&#x27;s too harsh, but that&#x27;s just my own thing which may have no basis in fact. Be aware that there are some replacement brush-heads that only have the top part spinning, and the bottom part doesn&#x27;t move. I think those ones are not labeled \\&quot;whitening.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, after a few months I have trouble getting the battery cover closed all the way. When it comes too far open, the batteries lose contact and it shuts off. I&#x27;ve actually cracked the housing trying to get it closed. THe problem is getting worse and worse to the point where it&#x27;s almost unusable now.</li>
    <li> The design must be defective, because I&#x27;m reading review after review where people have a similar experience. My spinbrush failed after just a few days. It seems that water somehow got into the battery compartment and quickly corroded the electronics. I&#x27;ve owned previous models of spinbrush and they held up pretty well. It seems that this new 2-speed variety of brush has a design defect. Definitely not recommended.</li>
    <li> At first, I hated this toothbrush. It seemed to consume batteries way too quickly and leaked from the top after use which made a mess on my bathroom counter. After the first one finally broke, I figured I would give Crest the benefit of the doubt and get another one because it was so cheap. Best decision I&#x27;ve ever made. The new brush is fantastic. Not one complaint about the replacement. It still consumes batteries quicker than I&#x27;d like it to (needs replacing about once every 3 weeks) but is a small sacrifice for the brush being so cheap. It cleans my teeth extremely well. I could see a difference with the 2nd cleaning. I switched from a manual brush, so of course I expected a little better cleaning, but it exceeded my expectations. By teeth actually shined in the light instead of just reflecting the light. I noticed that my teeth were substantially whiter after about the 1st month of use. Very compact design and is pretty quiet. If you plan on buying one of these and are switching from a manual brush, be warned that the vibrating takes some getting used to, but is easily overcome. I highly recommend this to anyone, and am using it as stocking stuffers for my family. Combine this toothbrush with Listerine antiseptic mouthwash and Colgate Total plus whitening toothpaste for long lasting fresh breath and sparkling white teeth.</li>
    <li> these make my mouth teeth and gums feel cleaner than a reg toothbrush ever could.  I got one of those $70 rechargeable ones for xmas and still like these best!&lt;br /&gt;something most people wouldnt think about - it is a pain if it will not lay flat, bristles up.  some roundish ones wont -drives me nutz!  this paticular brand lies flat no prob, and the med bristles last longer and clean best imo.</li>
    <li> Received it today and used it immediately out of the package. My mouth and teeth have not felt so fresh and clean in a very long while. Glad I replaced my old vibrating toothbrush brush with this spinning head brush. You can tell it is cleaning your teeth and gums a lot better than my old plain Jane. Buy this tooth brush and free the world of bad breath for once and all. ;-)</li>
    <li> Ive had it for about a month now. Seems to work very well. Seems to be well made. Have not had to replace the batteries yet.&lt;br /&gt;However, I have not noticed any whitening effect, even after a month. I do not drink coffee or smoke, so its not that I&#x27;m constantly staining my teeth or anything. I think the whitening aspect may be a gimmick, but I would still recommend this for a cheap electric toothbrush that you can buy replacement heads for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned tons of these, and all have lasted for a long time, years in fact.  The problem is after all these years, they cannot seem to make a spinbrush that accepts standard AA rechargeables.  What a lack on insight from their Research and Development team from such a huge company.  I never have an issue with water getting in, i never have a problem with longevity.  NONE of my rechargables fit, rayovac AA nimh, eneloop nimh AA, etc...  they are too tight in the battery holder, and when the battery holder clips into the brush the batteries won&#x27;t touch the contacts inside the brush without much banging and bashing, annoying me to no end and causing me some pretty bruised up hands in the process.  However, this is THE ONLY brush in the price range, if i had a few hundred laying around, me and my wife would have PHILIPS!!!!!</li>
    <li> These are great for the price, its allot better then spending the 60 dollars or more for the same thing. My wife and i both have one and we love them.</li>
    <li> Fine toothbrush.. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> After about 4 months, I decided it eats batteries every month (due to the double brush system), batteries aren&#x27;t easy to replace, water-gunk accumulates in spaces between the plastic in the handle, and sometimes the heads loosen and pinch gums. My husband and 2 kids also tried it, but tossed it after 2 months. Good idea, poor execution.</li>
    <li> This is the only toothbrush I will use.  Great results!</li>
    <li> great product at a great economical price</li>
    <li> just got this new one and love my old one....same brand :)</li>
    <li> Item arrived in the time stated and it is working very well.</li>
    <li> This product failed after 5 weeks due to a frozen activation switch. The battery compartment is very difficult to open. A very poorly design that should be withdrawn from the market. I now have the Oral B electric toothbrush and found it to be very welled designed, water proof, battery is easy to replaced. Stay away from the spinbrush and buy the Oral B product instead.</li>
    <li> Makes me teeth feel fabulous!</li>
    <li> Appears to get the job done. Battery powered...what else can I say?</li>
    <li> I like Spingbrush Pro toothbrushes because my mouth feels cleaner with every use. It&#x27;s battery operated; so I don&#x27;t need cords of any kind to use it. The head on the toothbrush is replaceable. So when you buy this item; make sure to also order a pack of replacement heads. I change mine once a month. I bought the medium bristles; but now I will try the firm ones because it seems that the mediums are too soft for me.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric toothbrush, so I can&#x27;t compare it to anything else. However, this toothbrush does the job very well given the price. I expect to have to buy a new one every six months or so because the handle gets wet and I don&#x27;t think that could be good for it. But the price is low enough to afford to buy a new one when needed. My only gripe is that the button is sometimes hard to push and I have to use my nail to turn it on. Seems like this is more of a problem when it&#x27;s a little wet from the steam in the bathroom. All in all, a good toothbrush that does the job.</li>
    <li> I love my spinbrush pro. These replacement heads fit perfectly and work perfectly. I highly recommend them. I have definitely noticed a difference how my teeth/gums look and feel after brushing versus a manual toothbrush.</li>
    <li> My experience was similar to several others who have commented about water getting into the battery compartment and eventually destroying it. I used mine for about 2-3 months before the spin brush broke so bought a replacement pack of two. I had noticed a tendency for water in the battery compartment so began to pay better attention to ensuring the compartment was closed after opening it. Despite this, once when the brush quit working and after opening the battery compartment to check it, there was considerable water inside. After this I could not get the battery lid to re-seat and so had to throw the brush away along with the second brush head previously bought. I can&#x27;t speak for the rechargeable system also available from Arm and Hammer buy I can definitely recommend avoiding the battery-operated one. It will cause you trouble. I am surprised that Arm and Hammer has never corrected this problem as it has been mentioned by several reviewers. Aside form this problem,I liked the toothbrush a lot but certainly can&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Pros: It cleans your teeth and makes them feel smooth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It is very loud, it vibrates your whole skull, it collects toothpaste in odd crevices that drips out afterwards, and then it breaks after 2 weeks of use. I must have got it too wet because all of sudden it stopped working while I was rinsing it off.</li>
</ol>
