      <li>once i figured that out it works excellent.</li>
      <li>They come out perfect and identical to the picture.</li>
      <li>great price too!</li>
      <li>and I was so amazed incredible</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s a great stencil maker</li>
      <li>This stencil machine works great</li>
      <li>lol.</li>
      <li>Cheap!!!  </li>
      <li>good for the price.</li>
      <li>so fare so good.</li>
      <li>They loved</li>
      <li>its a good buy, and it works fine.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for at a great price!  </li>
      <li>still loving it.</li>
      <li>great, nice clean prints .ez</li>
      <li>great product , works as advertised , shipping was fast !!</li>
      <li>great first try,</li>
      <li>Thanks eyepower for such a great product its awesome!!!</li>
      <li>thats how i learned how to use it, and i love it.</li>
      <li>Great product quality and shipping was reasonable.</li>
      <li>you might have to experiment a bit with it, but it&#x27;s easy once you get the hang of it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;it worked fine for 2-5 times.</li>
      <li>your money and get a light table</li>
      <li>A cheap thermal copier like this is a must have for any \\&quot;back-yard\\&quot; tattoo artist.  </li>
      <li>I wish I would of used it more when I first got it so than I can return it.</li>
      <li>not one stencil I tried coping, came out clean.</li>
      <li>makes very crisp stencils.</li>
      <li>This is a very affordable thermal copier that works very well for the price.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very upset because it never worked once.</li>
      <li>, I definitely recommend using Genuine Spirit thermal paper.  </li>
      <li>This is a pretty good little machine overall.</li>
      <li>highly recommended.</li>
      <li>You have to be sure that you align the paper straight due to the smaller size of the machine.</li>
      <li>I use bloodline paper from skin candy, and although I&#x27;ve wasted a couple pieces because of a poor feed through the device, if I take my time and set the paper correctly before copying the transfers have been perfect.  </li>
      <li>Cut out in the middle of a busy weekend of tattooing, right before a convention.</li>
      <li>no problems with it so far.</li>
      <li>No complaints at all and a major upgrade to my tattoo setup!</li>
      <li>If it continues to waste my $$$ paper, i&#x27;m demanding a full refund.</li>
      <li>Luckily, all of these machines work about the same, just feed your stencil paper yellow side up into the back part, and the design you want to transfer into the top-loading slot, with the design side facing the yellow paper.</li>
      <li>Do as the other buyers on here say and check youtube first before you use it, the manual for it is garbage.</li>
      <li>The instructions are in broken english, but if you watch some online videos on how to use a thermal copier the machine is very easy to use.  </li>
      <li>first couple of times i tried to make a stencil nothing transferred, then i realized that the stencil paper goes upside down from what i was expecting.</li>

<li> no more finger cramps for me....</li>
<li> but its making me give at least one</li>
<li> was worried about this product after all of the negative reviews that it received, but when it arrived it worked like a charm.</li>

    <li> great product , works as advertised , shipping was fast !! makes very crisp stencils. i would buy this product again if needed for the business</li>
    <li> was worried about this product after all of the negative reviews that it received, but when it arrived it worked like a charm. the instruction booklet is truly useless, in fact i would give this product 5 stars but the instruction booklet really is that terrible. first couple of times i tried to make a stencil nothing transferred, then i realized that the stencil paper goes upside down from what i was expecting. once i figured that out it works excellent. highly recommended. great price too!</li>
    <li> The instructions are in the worst English I have ever seen. I CANNOT figure out how to use this stupid machine... definitely will be returned. MINUS STARTS...</li>
    <li> This is a very affordable thermal copier that works very well for the price.  The instructions are in broken english, but if you watch some online videos on how to use a thermal copier the machine is very easy to use.  Before I would hand trace all my stencils... then if I screwed up placement or transfer of the stencils I would have to start all over.  A cheap thermal copier like this is a must have for any \\&quot;back-yard\\&quot; tattoo artist.  I use bloodline paper from skin candy, and although I&#x27;ve wasted a couple pieces because of a poor feed through the device, if I take my time and set the paper correctly before copying the transfers have been perfect.  No complaints at all and a major upgrade to my tattoo setup!</li>
    <li> This item works great! No paper jams, clear lines, and small enough to transport.  Exactly what I was looking for at a great price!  Would definitely recommend this item!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very upset because it never worked once. 150 down the drain. I would like my money back or one that works. I don&#x27;t even know how to try and send it back.</li>
    <li> it took a few tries before we got the hang of it. so fare so good. still loving it. its perfect for beginners.</li>
    <li> The product I received was terrible!!! The machine did not work properly... not one stencil I tried coping, came out clean. Cheap!!!  I returned it within 24hrs of shipment being received.</li>
    <li> Here are some problems with this. Instructions are horrible, the worse guidances ever - it&#x27;s like someone put it through google translator from some sanscrit or something. Next, attempts to print in carbon paper have been horrible.. it eats paper and spits out crumples, 5 wasted. Will be returning when I have the time, but since i need it now, i have to deal.. (for now). If it continues to waste my $$$ paper, i&#x27;m demanding a full refund.</li>
    <li> This stencil machine works great, I definitely recommend using Genuine Spirit thermal paper.  I have been using this machine for months and have had no problems.</li>
    <li> its not even the same machine as in the picture it doesn&#x27;t work the instruction manual doesn&#x27;t tell you anything I went through an entire box of paper trying to figure it out and still nothing I wouldn&#x27;t even give it one star but its making me give at least one</li>
    <li> Broke instantly cheap piece of crap</li>
    <li> After a month of using this item, it stopped copying on the one side. it got all grainy and not clear. Contacted the seller and they did nothing. About to try and contact again.</li>
    <li> This Machine Was A Gift For My Husband Witch Does Tattoo Work And He Loves It... Thanks eyepower for such a great product its awesome!!!</li>
    <li> excellant for the money</li>
    <li> Broke within two months of use, and the seller would not take a return. Cut out in the middle of a busy weekend of tattooing, right before a convention. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> it took some time to get use to but it&#x27;s a great stencil maker</li>
    <li> It keeps jamming and it stops working all together. I have a business to run and if my merchandise doesn&#x27;t work it puts us back.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good little machine overall. I managed to get it working great first try, no problems with it so far. Do as the other buyers on here say and check youtube first before you use it, the manual for it is garbage. Luckily, all of these machines work about the same, just feed your stencil paper yellow side up into the back part, and the design you want to transfer into the top-loading slot, with the design side facing the yellow paper. hit copy, wait, done. you might have to experiment a bit with it, but it&#x27;s easy once you get the hang of it.</li>
    <li> works as stated. good for the price. i&#x27;d buy it. so if you want one, get it. that is all.</li>
    <li> This item does not work don&#x27;t waste your money trust me.... I wish I would of used it more when I first got it so than I can return it.</li>
    <li> my tracing days are over with this baby I saw my friend using it and I was so amazed incredible I have to have one now....like I said get it now</li>
    <li> I bought this as a birthday present for a friend who is into tattoos. They loved it said it works great.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You</li>
    <li> then I read the instructions. I would have started there but all other reviews told me to ignore them and go to youtube. Ignore that. Read the instructions.</li>
    <li> no more finger cramps for me....this machine works great, nice clean prints .ez instructions to follow ,if not then you always hv youtube. There was one little prob..the power cord connection to the machine not holding tight enough, needed to change that luckily i have a few of those hanging around, don&#x27;t worry eyepower you guys can make up for that with my next order..lol.</li>
    <li> Great product quality and shipping was reasonable. Wish it had the USB port.</li>
    <li> ive not tried it yet im still waiting on other supplies ! i thought for the purchase price it would be nicer then it is</li>
    <li> yet, this product didn&#x27;t disappoint me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;everyone says how it crumbles and it jams and other stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ll admit the instructions are a little plain and not that helpful, but theres something called youtube, go watch a tutorial. thats how i learned how to use it, and i love it. its simple, it works, i wish it was a bit cheaper but hey, it&#x27;ll pay for itself and save me a heck of a lot of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dont listen to the other reviews!!!! its a good buy, and it works fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;!!!!!!UPDATE!!!!!! 09/6/2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is now terrible. i regret everything i said above, it sucks. dont get it. ive had it for a while now. it eats your paper like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it worked fine for 2-5 times. after that...god awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;save your money and get a light table</li>
    <li> The reviews do not do this little machine justice. I had mine out of the box for about 10 minutes and was creating the best transfers I have ever had. You have to be sure that you align the paper straight due to the smaller size of the machine. But it is a miracle in a little box. The transfers take about 5-7 seconds to create. They come out perfect and identical to the picture. I LOVE IT!!!!!</li>
