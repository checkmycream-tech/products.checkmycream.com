      <li>else do you need to know -- it honestly does what it says - and I LOVE IT!  </li>
      <li>else do you need to know -- it honestly does what it says - and I LOVE IT!  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
      <li>This is a great hair dryer at a fantastic price.  </li>
      <li>However, my hair did come out nice and shiny.</li>
      <li>nice dryer at a nice price.  </li>
      <li>The really nice thing</li>
      <li>It fits your hand well, has nice adjustability,</li>
      <li>This is a great dryer once I got used to having a full size dryer again.  </li>
      <li>and I appreciated the control I had, being able to switch between heat settings and air flow speeds to get the perfect look.  </li>
      <li>&gt; annnd a &amp;#34;cool shot&amp;#34; which Iove, Love, LOVE!</li>
      <li>this one was by far the best one I came across.</li>
      <li>Great hair dryer, nicely balanced, good air flow, and not too loud.</li>
      <li>It has a cool air blow feature which is good for finishing the drying process.  </li>
      <li>But it could be the better quality materials that make it heavier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love the color.</li>
      <li>This hair dryer is so much better</li>
      <li>But my hair has been getting split ends and damaged, so I love that this dryer is designed to protect against heat damage.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>It uses ionic ceramic toumaline to help reduce frizz and static that occurs from blow drying your hair.  </li>
      <li>I also had more shine, again a surprise.  </li>
      <li>hair comes out smooth and nice with the Remington.</li>
      <li>We don&#x27;t use the attachments for curly hair, so while they were included and seem durable, we&#x27;d not be able to say how well they work.  </li>
      <li>While I still like this product, I have since received a Bio Ionic from Vine, which I like more.</li>
      <li>Some days I do a better job than others.</li>
      <li>The shell of the DC and Revlon are plastic while the T|Studio uses better quality materials.</li>
      <li>Mostly I like that</li>
      <li>This hair drier is great, mostly because it is much quieter than most others.</li>
      <li>It also has a cool shot button, which I absolutely love!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nothing special, but it&#x27;s a nice touch that you can remove it vs. trying to get all the gunk out while wrangling the rest of the dryer.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It has the heat protection &amp;#34;ionic technology&amp;#34; that helps keep your hair frizz and fly away free, dries hair fast</li>
      <li>My favorite part about the design is it&#x27;s comfortable to hold, the controls are placed well for comfortable use and most of all</li>
      <li>so while I believe this dryer is worth the money and has some nice features, it seems like a lot of the others on the market.</li>
      <li>This one replaced the last Remington that I had (and loved) since 2002!</li>
      <li>It seems to take no time to get the cool shot on this one!  </li>
      <li>These attachments  go on and off easily, and there is even a “cool-shot” feature to help set your style.</li>
      <li>It keeps it off the counter, saving room and keeping it within easy reach.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is not, however, a dryer that is easy to carry around.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a good size for older kids and teens to use.</li>
      <li>it is very capable and effective at drying and styling.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;It has an easily removable filter, which is a huge plus.  </li>
      <li>So one great feature is this Remington has a removable filter for easy cleaning, and that will definitely prolong the life of the hair dryer if the filter is cleaned out</li>
      <li>Three heat settings and two speeds give it great versatility to do a speed dry or more leisurely</li>
      <li>I also like that the hanging loop on the end is nice and large</li>
      <li>This will be my primary dryer until something happens to it.  </li>
      <li>or if that light just for show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a fantastic value at this price point.</li>
      <li>*C.S. Light</li>
      <li>The Wind Tunnel also helped to ensure nice, smooth, straight hair - the way I like to style my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is lightweight and comfortable to hold, buttons are easy to operate and the cool setting works to set the hair.</li>
      <li>It has enough heat for curling but a great cool shot for setting the curl.  </li>
      <li>This ceramic dryer cools off quickly and stores easily under the sink, or anywhere desired.</li>
      <li>I did notice that the Remington does not seem to be as hot which is probably better for hair</li>
      <li>I once ruined a dryer because I didn&#x27;t realize I needed to clean the filter.  </li>
      <li>This is a nice blow dryer for the price, and it is more lightweight than my trusty Revlon/Helen of Troy model that&#x27;s still ticking even after numerous drops on my bathroom floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This specially designed dryer features a grill that is infused with microscopic conditioners.  </li>
      <li>in all, this is a good hair dryer, especially for the price range.</li>
      <li>It has three heat and two speed settings, and a cool shot button to help set your style.</li>
      <li>They stay cool to the touch during use.  </li>
      <li>Cool shot feature</li>
      <li>I didnt expect the claims on the box to really be true, particularyl at this dryers price.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good, no-nonsense hair dryer, and I&#x27;m rating it as such.  </li>
      <li>and it has the cool shot button as well.  </li>
      <li>I love this dryer so freakin fast</li>
      <li>and I like the three levels of fan and heat, plus the cool shot button.  </li>
      <li>I still love this hairdryer as much as I did on day one.  </li>
      <li>but if you are naturally curly it is a nice attachment to have.&lt;br</li>
      <li>All in all this is a very nice hair dryer for the price while the 9096 beats it in fit and finish ever so slightly -</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s not to say its very small or it would not make the best grab and go pack it up dryer, but</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s super lightweight.</li>
      <li>/&gt;At 1875W for both models, they both heat up quickly and put out a LOT of heat.  </li>
      <li>Overall, however, I definitely recommend this hair dryer as it has great features, works very well and is such a great value!</li>
      <li>Low speed and low heat works best for us.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> (UPDATE 10/13/16 Blow dryer just quit working)  I got this thinking it would not top my Revlon hairdryer I have which I had loved.  How wrong I was.  This hairdryer is about the same size as my other one and has the same 1875 Watts of power, but it&#x27;s got a lot more options!  Cool, Warm and Hot, and High, Medium, Low air speed as well as the coveted cool shot button that I like.  The Remington&#x27;s cool shot button activates faster than my other hair dryer.  It seems to take no time to get the cool shot on this one!  It also comes with two attachments, the one that I use for &amp;#34;fluffing&amp;#34; when I want to keep my hair curly and the other one that I use to help &amp;#34;straighten&amp;#34; when I&#x27;m going to flat iron.  I also like that the hanging loop on the end is nice and large so it hangs well on the hook in my bathroom.  Some hairdryers don&#x27;t even have that or have one so small it won&#x27;t hang on a peg.  I found that I was able to blow dry my hair quickly with this dryer and I appreciated the control I had, being able to switch between heat settings and air flow speeds to get the perfect look.  UPDATE 9/13/15 I still love this hairdryer as much as I did on day one.  I have relegated my other Revlon dryer to &amp;#34;back up&amp;#34; status, for emergencies or if my son needs one for his hair.  This will be my primary dryer until something happens to it.  I&#x27;ll update my review if anything changes.  UPDATE 10/13/16 - The hairdryer just quit working yesterday.   Could not get it to work again, not sure what happened!</li>
    <li> This is a nice basic hairdryer. We have a big family and own several Remington hairdryers. This one is in the kids bathroom. With its smaller grip it&#x27;s a good size for older kids and teens to use. It dries hair fairly quickly, on par with most other dryers we&#x27;ve owned. We keep it on a command adhesive hook above the outlet to the side of the sinks. The cord has a good sized built in loop for hanging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really happy to find that it comes with both a wide, flat nozzle for straightening as well as a diffuser for curly styles. My fancy high end dryer didn&#x27;t come with a diffuser and it took forever to find one that fit. I also like that it has a cool button, no need to slide a button up and down to set a style with cool air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint is that this dryer is a bit noisier than the other Remington dryers we have. It&#x27;s not so noisy that it consider it loud for a hairdryer but if you&#x27;re searching for a quiet model know this one is average to slightly above average as far as noise goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I&#x27;m impressed with this hairdryer. It&#x27;s a fantastic value at this price point. All our other Remington&#x27;s have lasted years.</li>
    <li> I got this because my old hairdryer was starting to get beat.  I was really surprised at how quickly my hair dried using it.  I have long hair which usually takes a while to dry and literally it took just a few minutes to get it dry.  Really surprising.  And it wasnt superhot either.  I also had more shine, again a surprise.  I dont know how a dryer can shine your hair but it does.  I didnt expect the claims on the box to really be true, particularyl at this dryers price.  A great deal!</li>
    <li> Great hairdryer, does what it needs to.</li>
    <li> After about a week of research (aka reading countless reviews on many different hair dryers) this one was by far the best one I came across. I have been using it for about two weeks now, &amp; it has totally lived up to all my expectations. I have long, semi-thick hair &amp; when I use this dryer on the highest heat setting, my hair is dry within 10-15 minutes, which in my opinion is pretty great. It is not silent, but not too noisey either. It also has a cool shot button, which I absolutely love! The loop for hanging the hair dryer is also quite helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this dryer has not given me any problems &amp; I am 100% satisfied with it so far.</li>
    <li> I normally do not use a hair dryer but my office now has a gym; after working out I don&#x27;t want my very long hair dripping all over the place. My hair is straight so I do not need the diffuser attachments that came with this dryer. I was surprised at how quiet this hair dryer is and how much volume of warming air it generates. My hair was dry in minutes. This dryer is light and very efficient. I love the color. Very impressive addition to my hair care regime.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair dryer at a fantastic price.  It contains all the elements I have in my older and much more expensive hair dryer.  It uses ionic ceramic toumaline to help reduce frizz and static that occurs from blow drying your hair.  It has three heat settings and two blower speeds.  I generally use the medium heat and the high blower, but I like to have the option to do a quicker dry with high heat when needed.  It also includes the cool shot button which allows you to quickly cool the dryer down in the midst of drying and styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has an easily removable filter, which is a huge plus.  I once ruined a dryer because I didn&#x27;t realize I needed to clean the filter.  Now I periodically take the filter off and blow the &amp;#34;wrong way&amp;#34; through it to clear dust that accumulates through time.  I do this about one a week or so and it helps keep the dryer running well and from burning out.  I have placed a towel hook next to my bathroom sink and I hang the dryer on it.  It keeps it off the counter, saving room and keeping it within easy reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer comes with both a concentrator for when you are styling your hair or trying to focus the drying effort as well as a diffuser. The latter is important for me as my hair has a lot of wave and curl and blow drying it without the diffuser turns it all to frizz instead of curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with this dryer and recommend it as a good and fairly inexpensive choice.</li>
    <li> This is a nice blow dryer for the price, and it is more lightweight than my trusty Revlon/Helen of Troy model that&#x27;s still ticking even after numerous drops on my bathroom floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the numerous dial settings, BUT this dryer does not that hot.  But maybe that&#x27;s to be expected because this is a &amp;#34;damage control&amp;#34; blow dryer, and heat - along with chemicals like peroxide and ammonia - is one of your hair&#x27;s biggest enemies.  Have always dried my hair on the lowest heat and speed settings, and the cool shot should be highly distinguishable from a warm setting.  On this hair dryer, you can barely tell them apart.  All heat settings feel relatively the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The verdict is that, using this dryer, it took a LONGER time to dry my thick hair.  However, my hair did come out nice and shiny.</li>
    <li> We like this little beast around here, I have short thick somewhat unruly hair, my daughter has long curly naughty at times hair. It works well for both of us. It got the job done fast with out being uncomfortably hot and feeling very heavy. That&#x27;s not to say its very small or it would not make the best grab and go pack it up dryer, but its no cumbersome either. It left out hair very manageable, love the two extensions and option for different heat and speed settings. Remington makes quality items for a fair price. We like it.</li>
    <li> This is a great dryer once I got used to having a full size dryer again.  I bonked myself in the head the first couple of times I used it because I’m used to a mini-travel-size blow dryer that is about thirty years old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dryer comes with an attachment for curly hair and a diffuser, two things my travel dryer doesn’t have.  The blow dryer also has dual heat and air controls, and seems so deluxe compared to my other dryer, which is very basic and only has a switch for hi or low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the snappy purple color too, but this dryer isn’t small and actually takes up a lot of space, however, it does cool down quickly so can be put away without worry of it being too warm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Featuring ionic technology, this dryer helps to keep hair moisturized and dries it faster.  My hair is long and dries quickly without frizz.  This dryer leaves my hair nice, soft, and fluffy, which is a very good thing when you have fine, limp hair.  I want to try the curl attachment and do a scrunching style on my hair, but I haven’t played with that yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn’t know Remington made hair dryers.  Overall, I’m very satisfied.  I think if any of you need a new hair dryer, this would be worth trying.</li>
    <li> This is a very good blow dryer. It has three heat and two speed settings, and a cool shot button to help set your style. It&#x27;s 1875 watts- so it&#x27;s nice and strong though not as powerful my professional hair dryer that does dry my hair faster. But my hair has been getting split ends and damaged, so I love that this dryer is designed to protect against heat damage. Only time will tell if that feature works, but I sure need it. This also has the usual attachments that I never use but they look the same as what typically comes with a blow dryer. My biggest problem with blow dryers is the motor dies from not regularly cleaning the lint filter (which draws in dust and causes the motor to overheat). So one great feature is this Remington has a removable filter for easy cleaning, and that will definitely prolong the life of the hair dryer if the filter is cleaned out regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair comes out smooth and nice with the Remington. My favorite part about the design is it&#x27;s comfortable to hold, the controls are placed well for comfortable use and most of all it&#x27;s super lightweight. Also, this dryer is not as loud as most others. It looks great in purple too. I do wish the cord was a little longer. It&#x27;s long enough for plugging into a high outlet in a bathroom, but if I need to use a lower outlet in another room  then the cord is too short for me to stand and dry my hair (though adequate if I sit down). I&#x27;m used to a longer cord, so others may not mind the cord length, but I&#x27;m taking one star off as I think the cord should be at least a foot longer. Overall, however, I definitely recommend this hair dryer as it has great features, works very well and is such a great value!</li>
    <li> I have been using an older model Remington hair dryer, and, while that model has held up well with daily use for over 3 years, this newer model is lighter weight and slightly smaller yet produces the same results as the old model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Remington says that it has micro conditioners to prevent heat damage and increase hair shine. It also says that its ceramic technology prevents hair damage and dries hair faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since using the Remington hair dryers (daily) my hair (untreated and treated) do not show hair damage at all - no split ends, no dry/brittle, no fly-away. Whether this is attributable to the dryer or my hair product (changed when I started treating my hair), I cannot say. I use shampoo &amp; conditioners about every other day and dry my hair every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry time is fast. The new model doesn&#x27;t seem to have a faster dry, but the dry time is pretty quick nonetheless. I do not use either attachment. This dryer comes with a diffuser (Remington caught flak with the last model not including a diffuser) and a directional blower. Both are standard plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this Remington dryer works well, dry well, and should last a number of years if it follows in previous models&#x27; footsteps. Very happy with the feel and results.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good, no-nonsense hair dryer, and I&#x27;m rating it as such.  Three heat settings and two speeds give it great versatility to do a speed dry or more leisurely styling assistance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m particularly fond of the removable filter...this is replacing an older hair dryer that was very difficult to clean.  I&#x27;m less fond of the attachments...not that they are bad or anything, only that I&#x27;ve never used any kind of attachments for a hair dryer.  They seem a little loose though, so I&#x27;m not sure of their ultimate utility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does put out plenty of power, and it seems like a &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; heat without a ton of noise.  It&#x27;s not whisper-quiet, but it does seem a little more discreet than my old hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So  I do like this - it&#x27;s handy with a decent amount of power behind it.  As I said, it&#x27;s no-nonsense.  And I appreciate it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned like 3 or 4 blow driers in my time. I&#x27;m not so good about consistently using them because I&#x27;m lazy. Well, I also know how harsh blow-drying can be on hair (particularly colored like mine), so I tend to avoid it. But every so often (more so in the winter), I find I need to dry my hair quickly instead of waiting. My last hair dryer died in a blaze of glory - well, actually it more or less fizzled and refused to turn on. So when this popped up in my Vine selection, I selected it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Remington hair dryer comes with attachments - one, a diffuser, that looks like an alien product (apparently used for curly hair), and a funnel appendage that reminds me of an airplane wind tunnel. I don&#x27;t have curly hair so I didn&#x27;t bother with the diffuser (I really wish it had not been included because all it does it take up valuable drawer space), but I did test out the Wind Tunnel (much as I like pretending it&#x27;s a wind tunnel for miniature airplanes, I would like to know, what is this thing called really?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love all the settings! My last hair dryer pretty much had hi-lo, hot-cold and that was it. This has 3 heat settings and 2 speeds along with a cold blast setting, allowing for a more controlled drying experience. I found it really dried my thick, wavy hair well (another reason why I hate drying my hair - it usually takes 30 minutes for it to be all dry) and relatively quickly. The Wind Tunnel also helped to ensure nice, smooth, straight hair - the way I like to style my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m impressed and pleased. I wish that the diffuser hadn&#x27;t been included because I have no need for it and the space it takes up BUT I know that those with curly hair may appreciate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 09/18/16: While I still like this product, I have since received a Bio Ionic from Vine, which I like more. The Remington&#x27;s Cool Burst is far too easily activated when I am drying my hair, a problem I don&#x27;t have with the Bio Ionic. Therefore, I am taking away 1-star to show this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brought to you by:&lt;br /&gt;*C.S. Light*y: *C.S. Light*</li>
    <li> This one replaced the last Remington that I had (and loved) since 2002! I have very long hair that&#x27;s color treated, and these types of hair dryers are a life saver.  I hope this one lasts 13 years... added bonus... it matches my purple-accented bathroom.  :)</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is slightly smaller than the Goody Heat dryer I currently use.  It is not, however, a dryer that is easy to carry around.  It feels well-made; it’s a little heavier than my Goody Heat dryer despite being smaller.  It is also quieter.  We have three puppies and they react very differently to the Goody Heat and the Remington so I am not the only one to think the Remington is the quieter dryer.  As far as accessories go, the concentrator and the diffusor are comparable to what you find in other dryers.  The heating speed too is comparable.  I have shoulder-length fairly thick hair so perhaps there is a noticeable difference with longer hair but there isn’t with mine.  I did notice that the Remington does not seem to be as hot which is probably better for hair overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a good hair dryer, especially for the price range. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a decent hair dryer, and we usually buy the less expensive ones because they seem to last as long, if not longer, than more expensive ones.  On this one, the handle doesn&#x27;t fold, which is kind of a pain for storing, and it only has two heat settings, which my wife found to be either too hot and not hot enough, so she went back to her old one.  The removable filter is a simple plastic screen that screws off of the back so it can be washed.  It&#x27;s nothing special, but it&#x27;s a nice touch that you can remove it vs. trying to get all the gunk out while wrangling the rest of the dryer.  We don&#x27;t use the attachments for curly hair, so while they were included and seem durable, we&#x27;d not be able to say how well they work.  At any rate, it&#x27;s a good dryer we&#x27;ll keep in the guest bathroom and can serve as a functional backup.</li>
    <li> I’m always in search of a hair dryer that can blow dry my thick, curly hair as well as my stylist does. (I know … I know … it’s the person not the tool.) When she dries it, she barely has to touch it up with a flat iron. When I dry it … I have to do a little more work to straighten out the wavy stragglers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review compares the Revlon 1875W Tourmaline Ionic Ceramic Dryer, Remington T|Studio Silk AC Professional Hair Dryer, and this one (Remington Damage Control (DC) Ceramic Hair Dryer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of them have:&lt;br /&gt;  * Same wattage&lt;br /&gt;  * Three heat settings&lt;br /&gt;  * Two speed settings&lt;br /&gt;  * Cool shot feature&lt;br /&gt;  * Diffuser and concentrator attachments&lt;br /&gt;  * Ionic technology&lt;br /&gt;  * Ceramic technology&lt;br /&gt;  * Hanging loop&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Revlon does not come with a removable filter, the two Remingtons do. (The TStudio doesn’t say it on the box or description. Company website confirms it.) Revlon and Remington Damage Control have tourmaline technology, the TStudio does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Revlon’s concentrator attachment stays on. The Remington’s fall off often. If I put the dryer down to adjust my hair, it comes off some of the time. It&#x27;s hot to put it back on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All three take about the same time to dry my hair. I may have gotten slightly better results (less wavy) with the Remingtons than with the Revlon. I say “may” because the difference wasn’t large enough to be clear. Some days I do a better job than others. Human error, you know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Damage Control felt like it took less effort and the reason is most likely because it’s the lightest of the three. The shell of the DC and Revlon are plastic while the T|Studio uses better quality materials. But it could be the better quality materials that make it heavier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can only assume the DC is cheaper than the T|Studio because of its plastic shell even though it has tourmaline technology, which the T|Studio does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve yet to try the diffusers. Whenever I wear my hair curly, I let it dry naturally. That’s the whole point of going curly – not having to do any hair drying. As for noise – I can’t answer which one is quietest because I’m deaf. It’s not a good idea to wear hearing aids while drying wet hair. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The winner? The Remington DC because it takes the least amount of effort to use and produces the same results as the others. The T|Studio is just too heavy and the Revlon doesn’t perform as well as the DC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update November 16, 2015: I downgraded the dryer from 5 stars to 3 stars because the heating element is giving out. It has been getting as hot in the last couple of weeks. When I switched back to an older dryer, I could see a big difference. Lasted only three months.enever I wear my hair curly, I let it dry naturally. That’s the whole point of going curly – not having to do any hair drying.

    <li> This dryer is inexpensive (under $20), light weight, has multiple settings (low, medium, hot…which supposedly reduce damage to the hair) and some attachments (two….one of which is a diffuser). This ceramic dryer cools off quickly and stores easily under the sink, or anywhere desired. Why then do I give this dryer 4 stars versus 5? Because there was nothing different or original about this dryer…so while I believe this dryer is worth the money and has some nice features, it seems like a lot of the others on the market.</li>
    <li> I have very thick course wavy hair and the Remington D3190A works fast and helps reduce frizz when I wear it straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The diff-user works very well when I wear it curly.  It is lightweight and comfortable to hold, buttons are easy to operate and the cool setting works to set the hair.</li>
    <li> Remington blow dryers may be a little heavier than you’re used to, but they are made well and made to last.  I have 3 of them in my household and like them all, including this one.  It has enough heat for curling but a great cool shot for setting the curl.  This one makes my hair a bit softer than the other two, which may or may not be your thing.  The sleek hair concentrator attachment is a bit tricky to get on and stay on, but only at first.  After using it several times it seems to work itself out and goes on easily and stays put.  I don’t use the diffuser but I will assume the same holds for that.  Attractive looking and a good buy.</li>
    <li> We have just gotten rid of all the hair dryers in the house to try some new ones (the last ones should have been thrown out years ago) and this one works great. My wife and daughter have very kinky curl hair and it takes time to dry their hair but this product cuts that time in half which is great. Very strong firm hair dryer that feels high end upon picking it up(although very affordable looking at the price). My daughter has taken over this one in her bathroom (she loves the color purple) so we have let her take possession of this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great hair dryer that you would expect to see at a high end salon.</li>
    <li> Let me start with the removable filter which allows you to  clean the dust out, my previous dryers did not have this option and the filter would clog diminishing the airflow and the drying ability. That is why this is such an important feature to me,you would think all hair dryers would have it!&lt;br /&gt;Now to its features: it has 3 heat settings and 2 power settings (*wish there were 3!)&lt;br /&gt; annnd a &amp;#34;cool shot&amp;#34; which Iove, Love, LOVE! I have very thin, fine hair and when I set my hair with heat rollers I use the &amp;#34;cool shot&amp;#34; feature to speed up the &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; and my curls stay in longer as the hair is more cooled down before I take the rollers out so the curls don&#x27;t fall out as quickly as they used to, my set lasts longer.&lt;br /&gt;I use the concentrator but have no need for the diffuser but if you are naturally curly it is a nice attachment to have.&lt;br /&gt;It has the heat protection &amp;#34;ionic technology&amp;#34; that helps keep your hair frizz and fly away free, dries hair fast (I have long hair) and doesn&#x27;t tangle it up when just doing a blow dry and not setting my curls.&lt;br /&gt;It has a 2 year warranty and is at a GREAT price for what you get. I would recommend this dryer.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned hands down!!!! I love this dryer so freakin fast it&#x27;s amazing. Came in less than a weeks time. Very pleased!</li>
    <li> Reviewed by Lynn Holland&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Remington D3190A is a great hairdryer for the price. It has multiple heat and fan speeds, so you have good control of drying your hair exactly the way you want to. In some dryers, the low is too cool and the hot is scalp –scalding, but this one is just right. This model has diffuser and concentrator to style curly or sleek These attachments  go on and off easily, and there is even a “cool-shot” feature to help set your style. I really like the fact that it is lightweight, so my arms don’t get tired while drying my hair. If I could change this, it would be to add a retractable cord, so it would store neatly. Overall a fine appliance that will get lots of use.</li>
    <li> While I can&#x27;t say I find this dryer faster than my previous one or that I notice any special benefits from the ceramic features, I do like the dryer a lot.  Probably my favorite feature is the cap on the fan at the back allowing for easy cleaning as that will extend the life of the dryer.  I liked my previous dryer&#x27;s feature of a retractable cord and miss that in this one, but it&#x27;s not a deal breaker.  I like that there is a loop for hanging the dryer if you want to keep if off the counter and I like the three levels of fan and heat, plus the cool shot button.  Mostly I like that it seems to have more power but doesn&#x27;t seem more harsh on my hair as I&#x27;d expect.  I have short fine hair that dries quickly anyway, but this dryer does that job without my scalp feeling burned.</li>
    <li> This dryer is lightweight, yet has a quality feel to it.  It fits your hand well, has nice adjustability, an dries your hair well without over-drying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the price is quite reasonable too.  Seems like a product that will last, and of course it&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;no name&amp;#34; product, but a Remington, so presumably the quality is there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A nice dryer at a nice price.  5 stars.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is so much better the one I had to replace. It is lighter in weight and the control buttons are so easy to shift back and forth between cool, warm and hot. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent hair dryer with some good features.  Some of these features seem to be from a marketer&#x27;s mind rather than real.  It won&#x27;t fix damaged hair...whatever that means.  It won&#x27;t make your hair shinier, healthier, or improve your already good looks.  However, in real world day-to-day use it is very capable and effective at drying and styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels solid and well built without being too hefty.  It has very solid cord connectors and circuit breaker protection built into the plug...excellent safety features!  The handle and controls are very well placed for ease of use.  They stay cool to the touch during use.  It has 2 speeds and 3 heat settings.  Low speed and low heat works best for us. It puts out a huge amount of hot air at high heat and high speed.  It has a cool air blow feature which is good for finishing the drying process.  It has a couple of attachments, a concentrator and diffuser, which you may find useful.  It definitely is not portable though it is transportable if weight is not an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair dryers are a commodity and there are a lot of choices.  This unit stands out in a crowded field and should work for almost all hair drying and styling situations and requirements.</li>
    <li> I love my new blow dryer. It does not dry out my hair. perfect. Thanks</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer, nicely balanced, good air flow, and not too loud. This is one appliance I hate having to replace, as you get so accustomed to one, but this one is if anything an improvement over my old favorite. Dual heat &amp; speed controls are a must for me. Nice inclusion of the extra drying attachments.</li>
    <li> This hair drier is great, mostly because it is much quieter than most others. This is a big plus, especially for shared bathrooms. It comes with a couple adapter pieces that either diffuse the air or focus it, depending on what your hair is like. It is clearly very nice quality. The only thin that would be nice is a retractable cord, but that is a small quibble. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This is a very good hair dryer for the price.  I am comparing this hair dryer to the Remington AC9096 I purchased this past Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At 1875W for both models, they both heat up quickly and put out a LOT of heat.  The motors are both reasonably quiet with the D3190A having a slightly higher pitched sound to it. Not louder per se, but just a little more trebly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Functions wise, both have 3 fan and 3 heat setting and a separate &amp;#34;cold shot&amp;#34; button.  The 9096 has a more positive click to the cold shot button but both work well.  Both come with the same accessories, a diffusor and a flat nozzle.  Both have ceramic and ionic technology though only the 9096 has the ionic &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; led light.  I&#x27;m not sure if you&#x27;re getting more ions with the 9096 or if that light just for show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other differences are the intake and output nozzle of the 9096 are smaller so the heat is more directed while the direction of the buttons are reversed (up vs. down being on/off, hotter/cooler. Not really a big deal I suppose.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the 9096 is heavier and more back heavy while this 3190 is more balanced meaning it doesn&#x27;t want to tilt up in your hand. All in all this is a very nice hair dryer for the price while the 9096 beats it in fit and finish ever so slightly - but I suppose that should be expected for the roughly $10 price premium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, it all depends on whether any of these differences are meaningful and whether the small price increase is justified.  Either way, both should be solid choices.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to believe a hair dryer could make a big difference but this one absolutely DOES.  I&#x27;m sooo thrilled with it!  My kinky/curly fine/thin hair has dried much faster than usual (even though it&#x27;s the same wattage as my previous dryer) and so smooth, soft, shiny and healthy looking (getting that without a flat iron also means that it gets to stay fluffier looking instead of flat and stringy).  -- I found it cheaper at Walmart, but it says it&#x27;s a LIMITED EDITION so if you can&#x27;t get it there, get it here.  But GET IT -- it&#x27;s great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I have to have on my driers is separate controls for the heat and for the air - this does - and it has the cool shot button as well.  The really nice thing if you use the end attachment that condenses the direction of the air flow, is that this dryer has a round end (not oval) so you can turn the attachment when you need to instead of holding your arm/wrist in awkward positions to blow at a certain angle.
