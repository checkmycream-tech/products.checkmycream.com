<li> Most store bought creams seem to further irritate his rash and are uncomfortable to apply!</li>
<li> I have tried several other products and nothing compares.</li>
<li> I have even mixed it with a small amount of the Remedy Antifungal Clear Ointment, and has proven dramatic overnight results and relief for the patient/toddler/family member.  </li>
<li> If put on thick enough, it will resolve a rash within 2 days- usually one.</li>
<li> The nurses only used this in the NICU, couldn&#x27;t go wrong.</li>

    <li> This stuff is great. My kid has really fair, sensitive skin and breaks out in rashes despite our best efforts. Most store bought creams seem to further irritate his rash and are uncomfortable to apply! He will scream and cry. This is soothing and healing and he doesn&#x27;t cry when applied. Natural ingredients and smells good too not at all chemically. Aside from my homemade cream this is the Only stuff I&#x27;ll use on my kids bum!</li>
    <li> I am happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent paste for diaper rash in toddler-adult care.  I will buy again 100%.  I have even mixed it with a small amount of the Remedy Antifungal Clear Ointment, and has proven dramatic overnight results and relief for the patient/toddler/family member.  Excellent Product!</li>
    <li> This works fantastic on healing bed sores, and works well for prevention in the problem areas.  Buy several at a time. More economical!</li>
    <li> use on my babies booty when she has rashes, its amazing!!! A lot goes along way!! We have had this 4 oz tub for 11 months and just now thinking about ordering more so im stocked for another year :)</li>
    <li> This was purchased for an elderly man, and he said it was just what he was looking for.  So, I guess it works well</li>
    <li> This stuff is magic! If put on thick enough, it will resolve a rash within 2 days- usually one. Be sure to keep it away from the baby&#x27;s mouth, as the bottle says to call Poison Control if ingested- but it will do wonders for diaper rash.</li>
    <li> I love this product I use it at nap on baby to prevent diaper rash , baby came home from children hospital and I used it loved it eversince</li>
    <li> This product helps with healing - from burns to blisters - I keep it on hand at all times.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Works great on reddened areas to prevent further breakdowm. Massage gently to reddened area while you apply.will buy again</li>
    <li> The nurses only used this in the NICU, couldn&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> This product was used on my 88 year old mom when she was in the hospital. She was stacrting to have some skin breakdowvn and it went away after I continued to purchaseit online.The CNA&#x27;s at the rehab said it was a really good product.</li>
    <li> My friend told me about this product as she uses it on her son. It works so well for my sons skin irritation under his trach ties. I have tried several other products and nothing compares.</li>
    <li> This is one product that really is gentle on the skin and does do the job. Love it and will not use any other.</li>
    <li> I gave this paste 4 stars because of the pungent perfume.  While the aroma is basically very pleasant and so much nicer than the astringent smells of most pastes, it is very perfumed ... too much so for my fibromyalgia sensitive nose to enjoy.  But the skin protection aspect works very well.</li>
    <li> This worked very good and I have been telling my friends and family about this product. I give this a five stars.</li>
    <li> I got a different product</li>
