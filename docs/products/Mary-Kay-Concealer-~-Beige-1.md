      <li>she loved it and it got here super fast!  </li>

      <li>This shade is too light.</li>
      <li>Great products especially the basics like wash, moisture, concealer and foundation.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>

      <li>Love the product, came right away</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have super light skin</li>
      <li>The reason I love this concealer so much is because of the consistency of coverage.</li>
      <li>so i just use it for highlighting and it&#x27;s not bad at all.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended for such a good price!</li>
      <li>°°° I highly recommend their foundation also:-)</li>

      <li>Whatever the reason, I ordered this on a whim and remember why I liked MK back when.</li>
      <li>But it wasn&#x27;t the right shade</li>
      <li>And it was the right shade.</li>
      <li>Too many of the concealers on the market today are very light and give little coverage.</li>
      <li>Coverage is decent, but there are far better products out there.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!!</li>
      <li>And it seems to cover under eye circles and blemishes pretty well.</li>

      <li>Coverage it good, goes on kind of thick but doesn&#x27;t look thick or patchy on your skin.</li>

<li> This purchase is just like all of the other one&#x27;s that I&#x27;ve purchased directly from a Mary Kay Consultant.  </li>
<li> from what I can tell A LITTLE BIT REALLY GOES A LONG WAY.</li>
<li> I like how long it lasts.</li>
<li> and I mean really well.</li>
<li> (The other is their Ultimate mascara.)</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t dry and give the appearance of wrinkles.  </li>
<li> this is not worth 13$ its way tiny and you have to apply quite a bit for it to show up...</li>
<li> next tim I will get a little darker color.</li>
<li> Just what I expected.</li>
<li> The shade was a lot lighter than expected.</li>
<li> but it is still thick enough to last all day.</li>
<li> It is a thicker concealer so a little goes a long ways.</li>
<li> I choose a slightly lighter color then my skin</li>
<li> The concealer covers well and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy like some others on the market.</li>
<li> I remember using Mary Kay&#x27;s Signature Concealer a few years ago</li>
<li> Received my order within a few days of placing my order.</li>
<li> Mary Kay has a few products that I will continue to buy forever -- and this is one of them.  </li>
<li> I usually use it, and if I don&#x27;t, friends wonder how I got the spots.  </li>

    <li> High quality. I highly recommend it!! It is as good as announced. If i need another one, I would buy it again.</li>

    <li> I have several dark spots and it covers up very well.  I usually use it, and if I don&#x27;t, friends wonder how I got the spots.  Will keep using.</li>

    <li> This product was ok. I used it a couple of times and that&#x27;s about it. The shade was a lot lighter than expected. The liquid was very thick. This might work well for others, but not for me.</li>
    <li> Exactly what  I expected.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t remember why I stopped using Mary Kay. Perhaps it was the MLM thing. Whatever the reason, I ordered this on a whim and remember why I liked MK back when. Great products especially the basics like wash, moisture, concealer and foundation.&lt;br /&gt;This concealer actually hides discoloration well without making my face feel like a cake.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really happy that this was delivered in only 4 days. I have only tried it once so I will need to try it a few more times but from what I can tell A LITTLE BIT REALLY GOES A LONG WAY. And it seems to cover under eye circles and blemishes pretty well.</li>

    <li> Wow! I bought the ivory 2 because the seller was suggested it to me. But it wasn&#x27;t the right shade so i just use it for highlighting and it&#x27;s not bad at all.
