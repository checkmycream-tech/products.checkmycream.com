      <li>The best ridge filler I&#x27;ve used thus far.</li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t peel, chip - use it alone with NO polish just a Hydrating top coat.  </li>
      <li>Fills my ridges and many times I don&#x27;t even apply any polish.</li>
      <li>Wear seems to be 2-3 days at most.  </li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>The product flows much better over the nail and dries rapidly to a semi matte finish almost a glow.  </li>
      <li>Store nail polish bottles perform better than this</li>
      <li>I use Trind nail repair on top.  </li>
      <li>Two coats are better than one.  </li>
      <li>I was amazed by now well this filled in all my ridges!  </li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>It is nice to have nails that all have a smooth looking surface.</li>
      <li>One thing to know is that it dries very quickly</li>
      <li>Super Glue sometimes helps for a while but the best bet is re-tightening the lid then carefully unscrewing it hoping for the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My nails appear smooth and stronger.</li>
      <li>so far so good.</li>
      <li>it is clear leaving my nails bright with a mild shine.</li>
      <li>and so far I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
      <li>It takes nail polish and top coat very well although neither is necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I had to re-apply after a couple of days as it wore off rather quickly -</li>
      <li>This is a  nice filler but being an 83 year old senior, my nail wrinkles are very pronounced.</li>
      <li>Great at the beginning but after awhile it starts to thicken and is hard to use.  </li>
      <li>I use several Barielle nail products and this is my favorite as it performs exactly as advertised.</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND AS LONG AS I CAN GET IT</li>
      <li>With a little bit of prep with my wife&#x27;s nail files and three coats of this filler the cracks are filled and the surface is smooth.</li>
      <li>Did not notice much of a difference in the appearance of my nails after using this product.</li>
      <li>and I really can&#x27;t tell much difference in the appearance of ridges on my nails.</li>
      <li>and my thumbs are ready for work in the morning.</li>
      <li>I tried several coats but it still did not make the nails smooth after polish.  </li>
      <li>It IS better than other fillers how ever,</li>
      <li>Then it starts peeling from the top of the nail down within 3 days..</li>
      <li>I love that it has emollient properties as age and dryness promote ridging...and you can&#x27;t effect the other!  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I have a physical job and work with my hands all day and rarely chip or tear my nails.</li>
      <li>No more hiding my nails from people :)</li>
      <li>Needing to use 3 coats to try to even out the ridges and this is after I smooth the highest ones down..</li>
      <li>Stays on for nearly a week.  </li>
      <li>so they look all natural.</li>
      <li>but it takes about twelve hours for it to harden completely</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been almost ten years since I have had thumb nails that looked normal.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND AS LONG AS I CAN GET IT I WILL NEVER USE ANOTHER BRAND ON MY NAILS. THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT.</li>
    <li> This is such an underrated product but once used you will find your nails healthier and stronger. Love it !!!</li>
    <li> Received very quickly, in perfect condition.  Very good product.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> It does even the ridges before I apply colored polish. The polish goes on smoother.</li>
    <li> Pricey and I really can&#x27;t tell much difference in the appearance of ridges on my nails.</li>
    <li> It is nice to have nails that all have a smooth looking surface. Love this product.</li>
    <li> Only had it a week.  Goes on well and so far I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Well, it helps on some nails where the ridging isn&#x27;t too bad, but it wasn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34;.  Wear seems to be 2-3 days at most.  It is an improvement, though, so I&#x27;ll continue to use it, and may try a different brand.</li>
    <li> Needing to use 3 coats to try to even out the ridges and this is after I smooth the highest ones down.. Then it starts peeling from the top of the nail down within 3 days..</li>
    <li> This product after two days starts separating from the nail bed.  I noticed no difference in the condition of my nails.</li>
    <li> I was amazed by now well this filled in all my ridges!  I had to re-apply after a couple of days as it wore off rather quickly - but I did not put polish over it so this may have been my mistake.</li>
    <li> I did web research to choose this brand.  I have almost prismatic angles on my pinkies which made polish look uneven.  Problem solved by Barielle.  Great for home manicures!</li>
    <li> I love all the Barielle products are excellent. This one is especially useful as hands and fingernails age. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This product is the best ridge filler I have tried.  I love that it has emollient properties as age and dryness promote ridging...and you can&#x27;t effect the other!  The product flows much better over the nail and dries rapidly to a semi matte finish almost a glow.  You could wear this alone or under polish.</li>
    <li> Stays on for nearly a week.  I use Trind nail repair on top.  Makes ny nails look smoother</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been almost ten years since I have had thumb nails that looked normal. With a little bit of prep with my wife&#x27;s nail files and three coats of this filler the cracks are filled and the surface is smooth. You have to look closely to see any flaws now. No more hiding my nails from people :) I touch my thumb nails up once a week to keep up with the growth, takes about five minutes. For those of you concerned about this product holding up under stress, don&#x27;t. I have a physical job and work with my hands all day and rarely chip or tear my nails. One thing to know is that it dries very quickly but it takes about twelve hours for it to harden completely so I will usually apply it a couple hours before I go to bed and my thumbs are ready for work in the morning. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Hid the ridges on my nails. I used to have beautiful nails but age crept in! With Barielle and a light color polish they are looking great! Couldn&#x27;t find in stores so ordered online.&lt;br /&gt;Mahalo (thank you) from Hawaii,&lt;br /&gt;Suzanne</li>
    <li> This is a  nice filler but being an 83 year old senior, my nail wrinkles are very pronounced. I tried several coats but it still did not make the nails smooth after polish.  It IS better than other fillers how ever,</li>
    <li> The best ridge filler I&#x27;ve used thus far. Very happy with the results, and with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Did not notice much of a difference in the appearance of my nails after using this product.</li>
    <li> Great at the beginning but after awhile it starts to thicken and is hard to use.  I use as undercoat for all my nail colors.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. SMOOTHS and thickens nails with no shine so they look all natural. Love it</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! Will buy more and more!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Two coats are better than one.  Will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> I use several Barielle nail products and this is my favorite as it performs exactly as advertised. A little goes a long way so one coat works well. If a thick coat is applied or multiple coats, the product tends to feel rubbery and might peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When dry it is clear leaving my nails bright with a mild shine. My nails appear smooth and stronger. It takes nail polish and top coat very well although neither is necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why not 5 stars? The cap of the bottle is cheaply made and separates from the brush applicator, leaving it behind, attached to the bottle. It doesn&#x27;t seem to matter which Barielle product either. If it comes in a nail polish style bottle the lid has separated leaving the brush behind. Super Glue sometimes helps for a while but the best bet is re-tightening the lid then carefully unscrewing it hoping for the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dime Store nail polish bottles perform better than this which is why it is mystifying as to why a company charging a premium for what they call a premium product would serve up shoddy and tacky packaging.</li>
    <li> Sells for $16.00 at (Drugstore.com) - great product  - better price here at Amazon.  Been using it for a week and it doesn&#x27;t peel, chip - use it alone with NO polish just a Hydrating top coat.  so far so good.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  Fills my ridges and many times I don&#x27;t even apply any polish.</li>
