<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love this product.  I&#x27;ve used it just a few times and I&#x27;ve been horrified at how much stuff it pulls out from my teeth and gums even though I brush and floss 3 times a day.  Using the irrigator, at first, is messy and fun.  I felt like a child learning how to use a new squirt gun.  My advice is to try this out in the shower.  The key is keeping the unit upright while aiming it at the inside and outside of your teeth.  Practice tilting your head until you get the right angle then turn on the unit and use it.  I know my dentist is going to be thrilled with my teeth during my next visit!</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use and really portable. It really helped me out in a surprising way recently. I was traveling with my cat and found that in the morning, she had decided to embed herself in the mattress springs under the motel bed in an effort to avoid being put into her carrier to leave the motel with me. After many unsuccessful attempts to coerce her out of there, I pulled out my oral irrigator, aimed it under the bed and out she came in a jiffy! It&#x27;s great for teeth and cat control!</li>
    <li> I love this little Handi-Dandi Oral Cleaner  Fast and easy to use!  Would recommend this product to all who  like a fresh, clean, relaxing way to finish the day.  Just enough power to do the job.  I could never get my Water-pik at the  right speed it was always to slow or  to fast.......</li>
    <li> This product cleans teeth, gumline and any details in the mouth by strong jet flow of plain water. In terms of cleaning performance, this product is excellent and I have little complaints. It&#x27;s a simple device with a power on/off switch and no pressure control, but this is adequate. The water jet is strong enough to break and blow away food debris stuck between teeth or, without going to any detail, anywhere for that matter. It just breaks and washes away not just soft stuff but also tough vegetable fibers and all. It&#x27;s almost like a dental floss and toothpick that can reach anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the way I use it, the strength of this product is that I can thoroughly clean my mouth and teeth with plain water, without using toothpaste or mouthwash. People who are very acute to the flavor of food, wine, beer, tea and other beverages are very much aware that, for full appreciation of the flavor of food and drinks, the mouth has to be absolutely clean, but you can&#x27;t use toothpaste or mouthwash because these products just ruin the sense of taste so badly for a few hours! But then brushing without toothpaste is not as effective. I always wanted an effective flavorless toothpaste and mouthwash but this product is actually better! Plain water has never before made my mouth this clean and fresh. Unlike false sensation of cleanliness that comes from the mint flavoring, this thing keeps my mouth clean and fresh for hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another way this product is great is when small inflammation breaks out in mouth, especially during the period of high stress or irregular schedules. It leaves unpleasant sense in my mouth, even after prolonged brushing using an electric toothbrush and a strong toothpaste. But this irrigator thoroughly jet cleans the inflammatory areas even if it&#x27;s under the gumline or other hard-to-brush area. It&#x27;s more thorough than toothpicks and brushing, and takes much less time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I&#x27;ve described the performance aspects, and in this regard, this product deserves 5 stars. But the reason why I took one is because the product design is not quite polished; this product has some inconveniences. This irrigator is a bit large in my hand, although making it any smaller would also reduce the capacity of the water reservoir, requiring more water fills during a single cleaning. I might like to see a small countertop design (like Waterpik WP-100) but using rechargeable batteries, so that it is easy to use when traveling or in bathrooms at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nozzle is held in place by an o-ring and friction. So the nozzle can rotate easily, especially after a few weeks of use. I prefer something that can be tightened, so that the direction of the nozzle is fixed in relation to the direction of the whole hand unit. Right now, I have to use both hands to hold the hand unit and the nozzle to keep aiming the nozzle precisely where I want to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The power on switch is placed in a rather inconvenient location. I would prefer to have a push-on switch rather than a slide switch for the power, because I aim and use bursts of water jet, although user opinion may vary on this one. Another inconvenience is that this device must be held upright in order to make full use of the reservoir capacity. This is because water can&#x27;t be pumped up when the remaining level is low, unless the irrigator is held upright. These are relatively minor inconveniences, but I believe they are fixable ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product is heavier and bulkier than an electric toothbrush, and it&#x27;s not very ideal for carrying. Perhaps irrigator is much smaller market compared to electric toothbrush, and the product design hasn&#x27;t been perfected and matched to the user preference yet, but products like this are very useful and effective as I just realized, and I do hope Panasonic and others continue to improve oral irrigator products.stars.

    <li> I have had 2 of the portable irrigators~~~in both cases, after a few months, they simply go dead? I keep them charged, changed the water pic part and they still fizzle out!    Does anyone know what I might be doing wrong?</li>
    <li> The story is this.  I bought a Panasonic (older model EW176 )and a Water Pick oral irrigator years ago while using braces for use in my office.    Water Pick was large and bulky, battery charge didn&#x27;t last long, leak water, slight mess, will rate zero stars.    The old Panasonic, battery life is very good, I can replace batteries using regular batteries, never lost pressure, no leaks, still working today.  Is great if you have braces.  Pressure is very good, some home electric machines have too much pressure that could make your guns bleed.  The pressure is perfect for this unit.  It has been more than five years and still working like in the first day.      Works so good that I just bought a second one (new model) for home use.</li>
    <li> I have had this item and used it for nine months now.  I really appreciate the help it gives in cleaning my dental work (rapid palitor expander).  I bought it on the suggestion of my orthodontist.  I wondered on how well it would work on battery power but it really does a good job.  I have rechargable batteries for it and when they are fresh they clean out stuff that flossing doesn&#x27;t get to.  Great for home and travel.</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what I wanted and hoped for. It is true that it doesn&#x27;t hold enough water to get through your entire mouth, but I feel that is expected due to the size of the resevoir. Its not that big a deal to refill it. Also, I haven&#x27;t had it long enough yet to atest to how long it will last, but at this point I am completely satisifed. I am sure that I will get my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> I reviewed a number of oral irrigators online and decided on Panasonic&#x27;s. I have absolutely no regrets. It works as designed, is portable, affordable and not too loud.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only downside is the small water tank but that&#x27;s it. I&#x27;ll recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> it really works. I also bought this for my parents and friends. &lt;br /&gt;good stuff</li>
    <li> I bought the Panasonic EW1270AC Portable Oral Irrigator about a year ago. Some have expressed concern about the battery life, but if you use rechargable NiMH batteries, you&#x27;ll get lots of use before you need to recharge them. &lt;br /&gt;I have fairly large spaces between my teeth due to gum disease, and while I like to floss, it is just too inefficient to floss after every meal. And with the spaces like that, there are lots of places for food to hide. With the Oral Irrigator, its a breeze to clean up between the teeth. Gets the darn food out of there. &lt;br /&gt;I have tried things like the water pik, and its too harsh. Besides that, the cord presents a hassle. &lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic EW1270AC Portable Oral Irrigator does a great job, and eliminates the hassle you&#x27;d have with a water pik.  &lt;br /&gt;I waited a year before writing this, and it goes to show, that I really like the product. If it didn&#x27;t cut it, I wouldn&#x27;t still be pleased with it a year later.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this item several times over the last few years.  It&#x27;s sturdy, holds plenty of water, and has the power to do the job.  Honestly, I don&#x27;t know how I would have done without it.  I highly recommend it. [[ASIN:B0000A10MZ Panasonic EW1270AC Portable Oral Irrigator]]</li>
    <li> I try for about a week, and I don&#x27;t like that much. If the company makes a tip with smaller opening where it doesn&#x27;t shoot out that much water (less messy job) and thus will also increase the pressure, I don&#x27;t mind to invest in the new tip and give it a try again.... That&#x27;s just give me an idea; I&#x27;m going to reduce the opening of the tip with \\&quot;crazy glue\\&quot; and see how it works.</li>
    <li> This one is acceptable, however, do not buy it if you are expecting it to be anything like a trip to the dentist.  It is not powerful enough for my tastes.  Expect to fill it a few times before you finish.   &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> The new Panasonic oral irrigator is a vast improvement over the old one.  It has a significantly largerwater reservoir and a much better \\&quot;holding-pen\\&quot; for the irrigator tip when not in use.  However, the little latch-door over the water-filling hole came off almost immediately - as did the one on my old Panasonic and only the fact that it came off where I could find it keeps the implement usable.  I had to get rid of the old one when I lost the latch. Batteries never last as long as one might wish but that&#x27;s a minor cavil. And it&#x27;s a bit heavy, but one of the few portable irrigators available and better than its few competitors. Overall, at the price, it&#x27;s a good tool.</li>
    <li> After 3 months of daily use, this nifty little device keeps on pumping! My wife wouldn&#x27;t let me take over the tiny bathroom counter with a traditional counter-top style water irrigator. In addition to the space, the dangling cord would have been a pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This portable Panasonic device tucks into my medicine cabinet.  It takes 10 seconds to get ready and it works as well as the counter-top device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, okay, you have to change the batteries once a month.  No big deal.  It is small and portable and it works.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> The Panasonic EW1270AC Portable Oral Irrigator works well in removing anything left behind after flossing, and seems it will clean any pockets in gums that flossing cannot reach.  The only downside is that the two AA batteries do not seem to last long.  Would recommend rechargables.</li>
    <li> Not as powerful as the rechargable Waterpic of similar size.  Much lighter and is easier to hold and control.  Noticed  weaker power into 3rd week of AA batteries. I have both products and use them in different bathrooms, always take the Panasonic when traveling. Waterpic stopped working after a short 6 months, company did send me a replacement at no cost to me. Very good customer service via e mail. Wonder if they will replace it again?!  If I only had one it would be the Waterpic as mouth feels cleaner after use.</li>
    <li> Does a good job, but you need to hurry, as the water reservoir holds just enough to complete the cleaning process. Don&#x27;t expect the power of a non-portable unit. Convenient for traveling.</li>
    <li> absolutely shocked with the power on this little thing, great product! If you&#x27;re just starting out try squirting in back of mouth first around teeth and gums and close your mouth over it as you do it so you don&#x27;t spray everything!  Highly recommended! Better then Flossing!</li>
    <li> Be very careful! The irrigator can caused a mess until you get use to it.   Not recommended for those under 16 years old unless supervised.</li>
    <li> I bought 4 Portable Oral Irrigators for my family for stocking stuffers. I am not a dental hygienist, but believe that after having my gums scraped once that you cannot floss enough. My 7-year-old son uses the product twice a day, when before flossing was a bowl of tears and rarely occuring. It is simple to use, and does what it needs to do. I wish they made the unit or the \\&quot;pik\\&quot; in different colors so you can differentiate users. We solved the problem with a Sharpie. Also it has no power adjustment like the electric ones do, so if you are ultra sensitive, it may take a while to get used to. Keep in mind you are buying a \\&quot;portable\\&quot; irrigator, so those things should not be expected. Good price point too.</li>
    <li> THIS ITEM IS WORKING GOOD, BUT YOU NEED TO FILLED WATER SO SOON BECAUSE THE RESERVOIR IS SMALL AND ALSO THE TIP IS MOVING KEEP MOVING WHILE USING IT.BUT ITS CONVENIENT TO USE WHEN YOU TRAVEL.I RATE IT NO 4.  DANNY CRUZ OF CALIFORNIA, USA</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m delighted with this product. To be sure, it doesn&#x27;t perform at the level of, say, the Hyrdo Floss stationary model. That&#x27;s just not realistic for a battery-operated portable. It does, however, perform quite well, certainly well enough to be valued for travel use. I recommend this highly.</li>
    <li> Just got this - built quality is excellent - the water jet is powerfull; wouldn&#x27;t want it any more than this...Panasonic products are always excellent and this is well designed and works flawlessly - highly recomended.</li>
    <li> I would give this a 5 because it is very portable &amp; works well, but it keeps collapsing while using it. You have to stop, open the door &amp; dry it off so you can pull it out again. I was also disappointed that the instructions say not to use a mouthwash in it.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s always some food that get stuck between my wisdom tooth and the tooth next to it. This product solves my problem. I love it.</li>
    <li> their are 2 choices for the rechargables 1. this one                                           2. the WATERPIK \\&quot;Ultra\\&quot;  the Panasonic has a 10x better battery because it holds a charge for much longer. If you buy the Ultra by WATERPIK you can rely on one thing if you use it continually, replacing it every 3-6 months. Too bad the Panasonic is so much weaker than the WATERPIK brand rival. The answer is there is no good answer for rechargables. I went with the best choice I believe which is   [[ASIN:B000CEMWHI ShowerBreeze w/ 3&#x27; hose Oral Irrigator]]More powerful, no dead battrries EEVVEERR, and best of all no freakin mess. NO CONTEST.</li>
    <li> The product is quite compact, so its good for travelling.  It works well and can the water can be filled without any problems.</li>
    <li> This is easy to use and does a good job.  It&#x27;s small size makes it easy for travelling.</li>
    <li> This irrigator is really useful when you&#x27;re travelling. Is not a good substitute for the electric ones, but do a good job on the run. The water tanks is small, you have to fill it several times to ensure that all your mouth is done, but filling it is really easy and simple and quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a really good buy if you&#x27;re going on a trip and wants to keep your hygiene habits. Good value for your money.</li>
    <li> This product is not nearly as good as the Waterpic which I have in another bathroom of my house.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using this product twice a day for many years and i couln&#x27;t do without it ....i take it along everywhere i go (in my carry on for fear of lost baggage )...it&#x27;s keeping my gumms strong and healthy ...it&#x27;s one of my best friends ! highly recommend it !!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best oral irrigator: strong motor, narrow jet, ordinary AAA battery compartment, convenient collapsible water reservoir, easy clenaing.&lt;br /&gt;Replacement for a Waterpick handheld with its weaker pump motor, a rechargeable internal battery that doesn&#x27;t last.  I had to chase around until I found a source that delivers to Canada. For some strange reason Panasonic does not sell it nor lists it here.&lt;br /&gt;Very prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> Very good product, easy to fill, easy to replace batteries, easy to clean.  all in all it does the job.[[ASIN:B0000A10MZ Panasonic EW1270AC Portable Oral Irrigator]]</li>
    <li> This water pick works as good as my non-portable water pick, and I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;(Revised)I have actually had two of these in 2 years. One an internal seal blew on one and the next one the irrigation tip broke off inside the unit. I wont be purchasing any more of these.</li>
    <li> As an adult in new braces I wanted a quick portable way to assist keeping my teeth clean. The item is easy to use, convenient and works as described. I like to use it more than once a day - when I don&#x27;t have time to floss. (A real pain with braces- threading the floss through the wires. ) If it lasts I will continue to use it after the braces come off.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!    I use it for everyday oral hygiene.  However due to its lightweight and compact size  you can take it with you. The unit provides great water  pressure for cleaning the teeth, better than the similar water pik   units I have used before and it does&#x27;t jam on small particles.   Even better I am using rechargeable AA batteries. I am still using the same battery even after two weeks. The water pik units use a large self-contained NiCd component that the company sells no replacements for - you have to buy a whole new water pik unit!</li>
    <li> I love this Panasonic Oral Irrigator!!  It&#x27;s light, handy and powerful!  I purchased a rechargable waterpik 6 months ago and it&#x27;s already giving me problems.  The off/on switch works only part of the time.  I assume that has something to do with the rechargable battery being defective but am not sure.      Anyway, this unit is more powerful and definitely more dependable!  I will use it all the time and trash the other one.  It&#x27;s handy for travel also.  Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I bought this Panasonic Irrigator exactly six months ago, right after my routine dental check up and cleaning.   I have had every Oral Irrigator that has been on the market, and this by far is the best one.  I love it, it&#x27;s small, it&#x27;s easy to take on trips, and I saw somewhere that the batteries die quickly.  I&#x27;ve changed the batteries, to date, only once, and I use it every single morning.  It doesn&#x27;t hold a lot of water so I just refill it again to make sure I get a thorough cleaning, and my mouth feels great.     It seems to be doing a darn good job so far, I don&#x27;t suffer from bleeding or sore gums.  I gave this Panasonic irrigator 5 stars, because I can&#x27;t find anything at all to complain about.  Try the Panasonic EW1270AC Portable Oral Irrigator, I think you will be pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Appreciate that it runs on batteries instead of having to be recharged.  Easy to fill, easy to use, very effective.</li>
    <li> This product works well and is so easy to use. If I need more water it is easy and quick to fill. This is so much better than my big old waterpik. And it&#x27;s great for travel.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this product. I wanted to use it while travelling because my main one is too heavy and large to pack. This waterpik is truly portable because it took up less space in my suitcase, the batteries lasted nearly three weeks before I needed to replace them, and it worked so well I did not miss my main waterpik I left at home. The only disadvantage is I had to do at least two refills of water in order to get the job done. I solved that problem by using a tall glass to dilute the mouthwash and water, and then refilling the waterpik to get my second washing. A great product!</li>
    <li> This item was a complete waste of money and I&#x27;ve already told several friends not to buy it. I ordered it for travel and it is definitely not user friendly. The only thing I liked was the size.</li>
    <li> I got this based on the previous reviews and have been using it now for over a year. It helped, along with a sonic toothbrush, clear up some chronic inflammation I was experiencing. My dental hygienist is very pleased. So am I. Uses batteries every so often. I don&#x27;t mind filling it twice if needed. It only takes a moment. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Very effective after-brushing tool and cleaner than floss. Because of MS/balance problems, I always need a hand free to hold onto the counter, sink or wall for balance, so it&#x27;s impossible to floss while standing at the sink.  Bonus:  eliminates the step of rinsing after flossing, so you save time, too. This handy \\&quot;squirt gun\\&quot; is plumb spiffy!</li>
    <li> Device worked for a few months then something clogged the water intake. Dead! Can&#x27;t get into the thing (of course) so there it sits. This is not to mention the miniscule capacity of the water supply. OK. Lesson learned. Went and bought a full fledged Waterpik.</li>
    <li> As a portable, it&#x27;s great. Only complaint is that it&#x27;s not as strong as I&#x27;d like it to be. Maybe because I&#x27;m using rechargeable NiMH Duracell batteries. From what I understand, they carry a lower voltage (1.2v?) as opposed to disposable alkaline batteries (1.5v).</li>
    <li> I had this for about a year and it finaly broke. One of the troubling things I discovered was that after a while it started to build up mold or alge inside the tank. I discovered this when the pick-up tube fell off and I had to take it apart to re-attach it. I was fairly grossed out at this black ooze but I cleaned it well and put it back together.     Be aware that taking it apart is not something you can do often as I broke it the next time I tried to clean it. I am however buying another of this same one as it is, sad to say, the only good one on the market. All the other brands are about as cheap and shoddy as they can get</li>
    <li> love it for its portability but I wish there were more pressure and more water capacity.</li>
    <li> Not as powerful as a plug-in electric. Must be filled several times each use, an inconvenience. Water comes out freely in other ways than through spout. Cover of fill hole keeps popping off, a nuisance. Cannot rate it against other battery operated units, as only used a plug-in electric before.</li>
    <li> Excellent product in its price rank. Easy to use, no special service and maintenance needed. Portable and powerfull.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item in 2009 to replace a portable Water Pic that I had twice purchased and the battery went bad within a year.  I decided they were dishonest since others had this same problem and they could not still be selling it without knowledge.  I swore to never buy anything Water Pic again even though I have great experience with their 120 V models.  An honest company does not continue with such an excuse for a product.  But this little Panasonic guy works just fine.  I have used it with alkaline batteries for more than a year.  They fall off with a gradual decline in power and after approximately half life the device becomes pretty anemic.  A couple of months ago I tried Sanyo Eneloop rechargeable AA batteries with this irrigator and could not be more pleased.  They pretty well maintain most of their power till they just quit. The device is a bit hard to get completely dry to pack for a trip so I place it in a ZipLoc bag and then inside my dopp kit for travel.  It&#x27;s the only oral irrigator I use at present, and it is well over two years old.</li>
    <li> I travel every week for business and needed something small and inexpensive for the corporate apartment. This is perfect for what I needed. It isn&#x27;t quite as powerful as the waterpik I have at home, but it&#x27;s perfectly fine. It&#x27;s easy to use; easy to fill, clean and store.  It fits in a medicine cabinet.  If I needed to travel back and forth with it, it would fit in my backpack or computer bag. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to my friends.</li>
    <li> This irrigator barely lasted 10 seconds with the water before it \\&quot;blew\\&quot; it all over me and my bathroom. It appears to be electric toothbrush size online, when in reality, it is so big and wide, my hand barely can hold it to even use it.  The pressure was sufficient, but after it blasted water all over my face and didn&#x27;t even last more than 10 seconds before it ran out of water. I attempted to use it several more times afterward to see what I might of done incorrectly, however it is a defective product and I returned it very promptly.</li>
    <li> Despite the fact that I am in my 60s this is my first oral irrigator. I can&#x27;t tell you how much fun I had during my first use spraying water all over the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, it appears well made and very easy to use. I have had no problems during the month or so that I have been using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives&lt;br /&gt;  easy to use&lt;br /&gt;  well made&lt;br /&gt;  the door to the water compartment has occasionally come loose but is held on by a squeeze mechanism, not&lt;br /&gt;  pins. When it comes off it is not broken. You just slip it back into place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives (all not very important)&lt;br /&gt;  It tskes two tanks of water to do my entire mouth. A very minor inconvenience.&lt;br /&gt;  The two required AA batteries do not last very long (a week or two). Unless you have a secret source&lt;br /&gt;  you are going to want rechargeables.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seems to be a reliable PORTABLE instrument at a bargain price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An Update: As of August 2012 is still works great. Actually batteries last about a month. It&#x27;s a shame it is no longer available but perhaps you can find a similar product.</li>
    <li> The reservoir isn&#x27;t large enough for one flossing, must be refilled.</li>
    <li> At 63 and just NOW getting braces, I was desperate for a way to clean my teeth (since flossing is all but impossible now, even with that silly little needle threading device they give you to pull floss between your teeth). I read tons of reviews here and other places and settled on this Panasonic unit. I&#x27;m on the road a lot so portability was paramount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been two weeks now and I use this thing almost to excess. I HATE all that chow that wedges itself in and around the metal-works. In fact, I find that I eat less often now simply because it&#x27;s such a pain in the butt to clean up and look civilized afterwords. I do have to make sure I keep replacement batteries around because they don&#x27;t last forever. And I usually have to fill the tank twice for a thorough cleaning. But hey, it&#x27;s portable, so you can&#x27;t expect a canteen with a hose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I really like this product and would recommend it to anyone who needs this type of cleaning (ESPECIALLY if you&#x27;re wearing braces - ha).</li>
    <li> I have a Waterpik WP100 at home and since I got braces I can&#x27;t live without it; however, carrying it is not so easy. I decided to try this oral irrigator after checking some reviews and I gave it a 5 after using it for 2 weeks. It works about 30 times with alkaline batteries, it does a great job (normally with one fill) and it&#x27;s very handy and portable.</li>
    <li> After replacing my portable Waterpix 10 times, I decided to try Panasonic EW1270AC portable oral irrigator.  This item uses AA batteries instead of recharging the battery.  So far I have been very pleased with this product.  I have replaced the battery one time since I started using it.  Although Waterpix was very good about replacing their portable waterpix, I think you would be happier with Panasonic. I don&#x27;t mind the small tank that some people seem to be unhappy with.</li>
    <li> I bought this irrigator for my son, who has braces.  He loves it.  Quick shipping also.</li>
    <li> I have now been using the Panasonic EW1270AC for over three months on a daily basis and find it to be a great purchase.  It is not as powerful as my AC powered reservoir tank Water-Pik, but it is far more convenient to use and does a good job.  So, instead of using the AC powered once a week, I use the Panasonic every night and my gums and teeth are clearly in better condition.  It is small enough to keep it near my sink without it being very intrusive, thus making it very convenient to pick up and use at any time. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I use rechargeable AA batteries so am not very concerned about battery life which appears to be about 30 uses on non-rechargeable alkaline.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic is great for traveling, easily fitting into my toiletries case.  I originally bought it for traveling, but am so pleased with it that I now use it every day. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Strongly recommended.</li>
    <li> I like this \\&quot;waterpik\\&quot;. I&#x27;ve had it a month now and I&#x27;m still on my first batteries. It holds enough water for me. My mouth feels really clean after using it. I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s really powerful enough, but then, the plug-in type probably aren&#x27;t either. And they take up so much space on your counter.</li>
    <li> Made well, works well.  Definitely use rechargeable batteries.  Mine last about 20 uses before needing charge.  Not as strong / forceful as an electric model, but still strong enough.</li>
    <li> A great product and actually better than I had anticipated.  I am greatly surprised as how I use it twice daily which is certainly more than I ever flossed before.  Well priced-easy to travel with and certainly a must for oral hygien for people that do not floss on a regualr basis.</li>
    <li> I will be buying my second one for all the reasons listed by others: travel compact, ease of use, power of pressure, large resovoir.  It does not takeup lots of space in the bathroom either.  The only objection I have with it is that it is not easy to clean out.  Water gets between the 2 cylinders and eventually gets cruddy with no way to disassemble it for cleaning. I am only buying the new one because I can&#x27;t clean the old one and it is getting pretty bad!  It still works well (had it for over 3 years)but I need a more sanitary one.</li>
    <li> This product gets an A+. Found it to be very portable for travel. Tank wholes plenty of water. Battery seem to last, been on 3 trips an still same battery. Easy to handle. Although i tried to think of something negitive, I just cant find anything. Worth every Dollar.</li>
    <li> I have owned several AC-powered oral irrigators over the years and as a frequent traveler I missed their hygienic benefits while on the road.  This irrigator collapses into a small package that easily fits into my shaving kit and I never take a trip without it.  Further, the pressure developed by the   small battery-powered pump is more than sufficient to flush debris from the gingival areas of my teeth. I have two permanent bridges and two implants that require fastidious cleaning and this product makes the process easy and thorough.  My dentist was so impressed with my oral health, I gave him one for Christmas.</li>
    <li> Money well spent. Easy and quick to use with great results. &lt;br /&gt;Great improvement to my gums noted by my hygenist within 30days of &lt;br /&gt;nightly use. Recommend to all.</li>
    <li> I used this last weekend when travelling and it worked like a charm. The water pulse is very strong, and if you hold it upright, you will get every last drop out. Once I used it a couple of times I was able to work fast enough so I didn&#x27;t have to refill the tank. I have a home waterpik unit with adjustable pulse and had to turn it all the way up to match the strength of this portable irrigator. This is way better and much faster than flossing! I used rechargeable AA digital camera batteries to power this in case they ran low, but after 4 uses, they did not.</li>
    <li> This irrigator is a great product.  Its surprisingly strong and a great thing to have around as an oral hygiene aid.  Helps get the particles out that you have brushed out.  I would recommend it, especially those people with \\&quot;food traps\\&quot; in their mouths, or braces.</li>
    <li> Too much pressure for my sensitive gums, my husband loves the pressure. Seems to work great except the water compartment constantly molds and mildew builds up on the inside. It&#x27;s a pain to keep clean since it doesn&#x27;t come completely apart to clean properly. After 6 months I&#x27;m definitely buying a different model.</li>
    <li> I bought this at the same time as the waterpik ultra. I love the waterpik, but am not such a big fan of this item. It is a bit awkward to handle. It doesn&#x27;t seem as sanitary, since the water canal doesn&#x27;t dry out all that easily, and it isn&#x27;t quite powerful enough. My mouth just doesn&#x27;t seem as clean afterwards.     That being said, it is probably not a bad choice for travel, when you don&#x27;t want to lug around your waterpik. I have braces, so need to get the gums and between my teeth clean, so I will use it for this purpose. I definitely would not use it to replace flossing, more as an addition to flossing.     It is easy to fill, and would be useful in a bathroom that doesn&#x27;t have an outlet available (i.e. my parents have such an ancient bathroom that it does not).     Overall, I can only give it a fair rating. I am not overly impressed.</li>
    <li> Based on the cost and the limitation associated with a portable device (battery powered), this product performs very well.  The water pressure is not as strong as my full size waterpik, but I can carry it along anywhere and also use it at work.&lt;br /&gt;Some time, I have to refill the water to get the job done, but that is OK because I prefer to keep the size as is.  If there is any complaint I have to make is the water pressure, but I prefer to have this way rather than having higher pressure, but has to add power adapter or bigger/heavier design.&lt;br /&gt;I think the AA size battery is excellent choice of design compared to irreplaceable rechargeable battery.  I cannot say much with the durability yet since I have not reached 4 months of usage yet - otherwise it is fine.</li>
    <li> This one has a great design for travel but I found two issues    1) Not enough power  2) Water tank i too small    I returned mine.</li>
    <li> For my purpose - to take it on trips, it is great and it holds enough water for 2 quadrants. What I wished it had is a switch to alter the strength of the water flow. It is pretty strong.  Otherwise - I had returned a waterpik - it works quite well.    And that was only for the first few tries. Now I am actually on a 4 months trip and cannot use it as it does not turn on. I am disappointed and will have to return it.</li>
    <li> I really like this product...it does the job...rinses my mouth and gets everything out. It is easy to work and a great product!</li>
    <li> Not much water. Difficlult to navigate in my mouth. Water Pic is much better but Water Pic&#x27;s quality has declined a lot over the years and they don&#x27;t offer much repair on many units.</li>
    <li> This is not an ultrasonic cleaner like the dentist uses; this has just a gentle jet of water which nonetheless seems to regularly wash out stuff that neither brushing nor flossing dislodged. I have found some of the waterpik models to be painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it for a little over a year now, taken it on several out of town trips, and had no problems with it. I find the thirty seconds or so that the reservoir lasts is long enough for one pass through my gums.  And the dentist thought my gums were healthy, unlike the previous checkup a year ago.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son after he got his braces.  He loves it.   It&#x27;s easy to use, compact enough to fit in the small cabinet in his bathroom and fits in a Zip-Loc bag for traveling.    I have had 3 of the portable Water-Pik brand versions but all lost battery power in only a few months even though they were supposed to be rechargeable (which seemed more &#x27;green&#x27; to me).  However, this one has as much power and has held it&#x27;s charge for 2 months now with no trouble.  While I liked the interchangeable picks on the Water-Pic brand this one seems to be a much better value if you are looking for a small, portable version.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for an extended vacation this winter and it seems it will be a nice unit for traveling. It stores fairly compact and uses 2 common AA batteries.  These irrigators are critical to my dental care program and regular use has helped me immensely over the years. However, compared to my standard Water-Pik home unit the pressure of the pulses is much gentler. I think it will still benefit me during a 5 month long tour in Europe and SE Asia but to those of you buying it for home use I would recommend getting one of the larger, 120v units.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about this amazing little device. As an adult with braces I&#x27;m always nervous about food in my braces when out. This is small enough to keep in my handbag, yet does the job. The kids even steal it for water gun usage.  Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> There is only one speed, which is really strong and empties the water tank way too quick. Basically the tank holds enough water to last about 5 seconds. If you accidentally push on the top half of the item while holding it water spills out at the center of the device. In addition the product is too big and bulky for the average woman&#x27;s hand. It is hard to direct the water flow in your mouth and hold it at the same time. What a mess it can make, water was everywhere.</li>
    <li> I travel frequently and this unit does everything that my larger counter type unit does..........mainly an irragation flossing of my teeth.  It contains enough water in its resevoir to do a complete one time flossing without having to refill.  The batteries being used twice a day lasts about 10 days.  Compact and easy to travel with.</li>
    <li> I waterpik daily so I use it every time I travel.  Note, the picture is of a different (newer?) model but I&#x27;m happy with the one they sent me as it is identical to my previous one (left in some hotel bathroom...).  Bring extra AA batteries on a long trip.</li>
    <li> Very handy unit, especially for use when traveling. Collapses into compact package. Does not run for 20 minutes as advertised (probably a typo), but the water supply will last maybe 30 seconds - enough time to rinse your teeth pretty well. (You can quickly refill the reservoir and resume cleaning with minimum delay and inconvenience.) Big tip: although unit works well with ordinary alkaline batteries (2 AA cells) invest a few dollars in rechargeable NiMH cells as used in digital cameras; they power the irrigator for a long time with top performance and can be easily recharged.  I&#x27;m buying more of the irrigators for gifts; they are inexpensive and provide a useful purpose.</li>
    <li> This my second panasonic oral irrigator.  The first lasted 4 years with twice daily use.  The irragator goes with me wherever I travel and provides for a clean and refreshing finish to my morning and evening brushing.  Buy one, you cannot be anything but pleased</li>
    <li> Owning this is a feel-good situation. It works great, is simple, and attractive in a simple way. BTW,the tank seems a good size to me.  After my cordless Water Pic gave out early, I tried the system that attaches to the shower head. It is not nearly as well engineered. The panasonic is the clear winner to me at this time.</li>
    <li> Clever design makes for a compact unit which worked well for me on a recent two week trip.  It would be nice if a second head could be included since I travel with my wife, and we had to keep cleaning the head for individual use.  Also there is no pressure regulator. The pressure on full battery charge too strong for us. I managed to reduce this by using slightly used batteries.  I would buy this unit again.</li>
    <li> I advise using this device in the shower since the squirt action is forceful (that gets the particles out from under bridge) and makes a mess at sink area. Better than flossing and a good value.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for less than one month. It is replacing a larger irrigator I had which broke. Thus far, I like it; it seems to work fine, probably not quite as powerful, but serves my purposes. It is quite small thus portable enough to take on trips (unlike the larger dental irrigators), which I like. I will reserve final judgment until I&#x27;ve used it for a longer time. The batteries seem to last long enough that it is not a nuisance (something I was concerned about before buying this). So far I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my son who wears braces.  I bought it instead of a Waterpik product, because it received better quality reviews.  The first time he used it, he was impressed, but after only two uses the batteries had been drained to the point that it only produced a mediocre jet of water.  His other complaint is that it requires at least 5-6 refills of water or mouthwash to do a thorough job of cleaning his teeth. After using it for a week, and changing batteries twice to keep the jet at maximum flow, he has gone back to flossing.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, we are horribly disappointed with the Panasonic EW1270AC and consider it a complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> I am happy with this product. It would&#x27;ve been  nice if it would come with additional irrigator like the Waterpik portable unit, but it is more compact and transportable than the waterpik model and it runs on ordinary batteries. Great for travel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2011 Update: 5 years later and the irrigator is still working well, but seems to drain the 2xAA batteries faster now as it does not seem to deliver the same high pressure stream for the same duration as it once had..so I replace batteries about once every 3-4 weeks now.</li>
    <li> Very good for travel purposes. Water pulsation is strong enough (not quite as strong as Water Pik at full strength, but fine for travel). Need to fill with water twice to do a good job, but that only takes a couple seconds.</li>
    <li> I use it when my gums get irritated, not every day. My Routine: brushing, flossing, irrigating with water and finishing with mouthwash and a sore spot is gone in two days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good power when 2 AA batteries are new. New batteries would last through several weeks of daily use. Low pressure when batteries  need replacing. Easy to use, A nice compact size and can compact to half its size though I don&#x27;t do that until it is dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More pics should be purchased if more than one person will use the appliance.</li>
    <li> This little device does it right. Much better than the WaterPik I owned....The built-in battery in the WaterPik eventually wears out and you are stuck with a paper weight.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Get some rechargable batteries and one charge should last for weeks. Packs nicely for travel too.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the options of larger electric units I&#x27;ve used in the past, but the fact it is portable, inexpensive and works well makes it a great choice.</li>
    <li> The chore of flossing has never been easier! I have a rather long bridge and it was a real pain to keep things clean underneath - no longer with this irrigator! I keep it in the shower and cleaning is a daily event.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I do tend to have it to fill it a couple of times, but only takes a second. Power behind the water is very adequate to achieving a thorough cleaning.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only thing is I wish it came with a couple of tips to be able to share with the family. Additional tips are more than $5 each, even on Amazon.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, a very solid construction and performance.</li>
    <li> We have one of the older irrigators that must be plugged in, etc.  I wanted some portability and found this unit.  Works very well.  It does not have a power adjustment setting -- and it sparys hard.  I also have to fill it usually two times (but that&#x27;s no problem).  I would buy this unit again.</li>
    <li> I love this!  Replaces flossing and gives your teeth a fresh and clean feeling. Fill two or three times for a complete treatment.  I hate to floss and I use this irrigator two times a day!  You will love this product.  Linda</li>
    <li> This compact sized irrigator works quite well. I use it while in the shower, because it does spew water around if you are not careful. You have to keep your lips in an almost-closed position around the sprayer tip to fully prevent spraying outward. I have a permanent retainer secured to my teeth and this machine works well at cleaning out food residue. My bathroom vanity space is very limited, so this sets in the shower for my use. I love the fact that it takes regular batteries too. I would purchase replacement tips for other family members who use it. They are available through Panasonic&#x27;s website. Overall, a good buy.</li>
    <li> After the first use with the Panasonic Oral Irrigator my mouth felt refreshed! I used this before going to bed and my mouth still felt completely clean when I woke up. It is very powerfull, but the water doesn&#x27;t last very long. The Panasonice Oral Irrigator can be compacted down and stored easily. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Only downfall......this must be used in the shower or outside. It WILL MAKE A COMPLETE MESS. I will use mine in the shower from now on. My mirror got a nice bath afterwards!</li>
    <li> I purchased this Panasonic Oral Irrigator to take along when traveling. Since I have a prosthetic device in my lower jaw, I need to have a way of keeping the area clean. It was kind of hard lugging a regular sized water pik along when traveling. This portable unit worked great for me. It was easy to fill and handle, and the water pressure was sufficient to do the job. I would even consider using it at home daily. Very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> I just got back from 16 days in the UK. I bought the Panasonic EW 1270 for this and other upcoming trips after reading the reviews and deciding against the Waterpik portable (because of reports of battery usage).     I never had to change batteries during my trip. This product was completely reliable and performed well. Yes, you will run out of water if you are not quick and what&#x27;s the big deal about filling the well again? One point: the pictures are taken from a side angle so it looks smaller than it really is - 2.5x6x1.5 or so. It also has enough weight to make a backpacker think twice about carrying it on a trek.     If you are looking for something to take with you traveling, I recommend this item. - Kathy in CA</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great little device.  As an adult, I got braces on the back of my teeth. It&#x27;s impossible to get food out w/out a water pick.   This one travels well - I can keep it in a big purse and it does the job just fine.  I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using an oral irrigator that attaches to a shower arm, so I am used to a very slim handle attached to a flexible hose. I find this Panasonic unit awkward to hold and am having trouble reaching my back teeth.  Also, I find I have to refill it at least 3 or 4 times.  But for travel it is better than nothing.</li>
    <li> It was very powerful, but very uneven. And seriously my bathroom mirror kept getting soaked. PLUS there should be two speeds. Not just one long stream which you can&#x27;t control. Grrrrrrrrrr, wish I would get my money back.</li>
    <li> My orthodontist strongly recommmended an oral irrigator when I was fitted with braces last year, and specifically mentioned a Waterpik. I think Waterpik has become similar to kleenex; a brand representing a category. Without any research I went to the closest drug store and purchased a Waterpik for about $50. I loved it at first - the gratification of seeing the food spilling into the sink - excellent! But in just a matter of months it simply stopped working - kaput. I chalked this up to bad luck, \\&quot;I got a lemon\\&quot; I told myself and went back to the store for another. A few months later, the same story. Again and again. In the end I bought four Waterpiks and every single one died within a few months. It was at that point I finally excercised some due diligence and investigated alternatives. The Panasonic is vastly superior to Waterpik in every way. First and foremost it still works after several months. Second, it has a great compact design, making it easy for travel. Finally, it was cheaper than any Waterpik I had purchased in the past. All in all this is a great product at a very good price.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a travel irrigator and although the spray is not as intense as I would like, I am impressed with the rest of its features.</li>
    <li> I use water pik at home.  and I love it! I can&#x27;t live with out it.  but I travel a lot! so, I bought this portable Panasonic EW120 because it has  great reviews. But when I used it for the first time, I was disappointed because the water comes out a lot weaker than my water pik at home. but I will use it until it dies on me.</li>
    <li> After reading the other reviews and having experience with a \\&quot;countertop waterpic\\&quot;, I did not know what to expect. When We opened the box We found an excellent product, properly weighted, with ample room for water or water/mouthwash for both my wife and me. Though it lacks a \\&quot;pressure adjust\\&quot;, the force was sufficient to do the job we needed, the tip is adjustable with the \\&quot;star\\&quot; located at the bottom of the probe. The reservoir door even snaps back on when it \\&quot;popped off\\&quot;.     No leaks, battery power, does its&#x27; job, decent price...whats not to like? Would recommend this to anyone...in fact we just ordered a second one for a spare.</li>
    <li> I love this product and would recommend it.  Has enough power to wash off items the brush can&#x27;t reach between the teeth.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this unit.  Last about a month on 2 AA batteries and compact enough to travel anywhere.  Powerful and effective.  My dentist thought he saw an improvement when I mentioned that I started using it.    There are downsides.  One, the small size means you have to refill a few times per session.  Two, as it drains, the partial vacuum sometimes pulls the tank up into the main unit.  Just a bit uncomfortable, but doesn&#x27;t cause any problems in functioning so I still give it a \\&quot;5\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I have recently purchased the Panasonic Irrigator and love this a lot.  I usually use the irrigator after brushing my teeth. I use it around the gum line and works very well for me. I am very happy with this purchase</li>
    <li> I would suggest this item if you are looking for a good portable oral irrigator.</li>
    <li> The irrigator works very well and is easy to use. The only downside is its small water capacity, but if it were larger the unit might be too large to handle easily. Because of its size, it would be good for traveling.</li>
    <li> Cannot say that this is great, the water pressure is weak and the tank too small and after taking it with me on a few trips, it stopped working.</li>
    <li> the Panasonic does a decent job. It holds enough water and the battery lasts a long time. I had the portable WaterPik and it was awful.</li>
    <li> This is a good oral irrigator that you can take with you on vacation. I recomend though that you use lithium batteries otherwise the alkalines do not last long</li>
    <li> I was skeptical a battery powered Water Pick, not much bigger than an electric toothbrush, would be effective but I was pleasantly surprised.  It is amazingly powerful and has enough spray for a single session (30-40 seconds.)  I&#x27;ll probably try rechargeable batteries because I&#x27;ve gone through my third set in maybe a 2 months.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something in addition to regular teeth. So it&#x27;s a nicely add-on. The water container sure is small and I usally need 2nd refill. However the machine itself is small and handy too and not very noisy compared to the larger water piks.</li>
    <li> The instructions tell you to keep it upright and to put it in your mouth and close your mouth around it before turning it on.  If you&#x27;re careful to do this, it works well; otherwise, it leaks and sprays. Also, be careful not to aim it at your tonsils -- it made mine hurt and bleed.</li>
    <li> After using 2 different brands of oral irrigators and having them both die prematurely, I tried this Panasonic portable irrigator. It&#x27;s biggest advantage is that it&#x27;s small in size and portable. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s small in size which means it&#x27;s fluid capacity is limited and it must constantly be refilled to do the job.  Additonally, it lacks the pressure adjustablility of conventional tank irrigators and I find the output could be stronger.  &lt;br /&gt;So far, battery life seems acceptable. I use rechargeable batteries, so that shouldn&#x27;t be too much of an issue.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best oral irrigators available, if not the best.  If you take a look at similar products from WaterPik or InterPlak, they are usually very big (taking up most of your counter) or very noisy.  This Panasonic irrigator is neither- it&#x27;s a little larger than a regular electronic toothbrush and fairly quiet. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It uses two AA batteries which are not included, but that doesn&#x27;t matter as I recommend using rechargeable batteries.  The \\&quot;20 minutes\\&quot; of cleaning is about the total time that it lasts on regular Alkaline batteries, but of course it will last much longer on your own rechargeable NiMH batteries.  People complain that the water tank is too small and lasts 20 seconds, but I mean, that&#x27;s the tradeoff right?  You can&#x27;t have a small unit and a big tank at the same time.  It doesn&#x27;t matter though since filling it up is easy: just open up the cap and fill it up.  A typical full mouth cleaning takes 1-3 fill ups. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The build quality is excellent.  The plastic feels very solid. &lt;br /&gt;It thoroughly cleans food and other particles from your teeth.  Like any oral water pick though, water gets everywhere (this happens with all oral irrigators- it&#x27;s inherent in how it works), so I usually recommend using this over the bath tub (unless you&#x27;re okay with cleaning up the water from the mirror). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This Panasonic product is top-notch and definitely is better and more reliable than the Interplak and Waterpik competition.  I strongly recommend it ... excellent value.</li>
    <li> Bought this product for my parents.  They use a waterpik at home, but were looking for something portable for a trip.  Worked great.</li>
    <li> I recently went on a European trip for 3 weeks and bought the Portable Oral Irrigator especially for this occasion.  I was looking for something compact.  It was a great buy!  It&#x27;s not only compact, but powerful too. &lt;br /&gt;Now I keep it at work and use it everyday.</li>
    <li> This item worked great.  I acutally bought 3 of them for different family memebers. Everyone likes this item and no one has problems with them.  As most people know these can be messy with water shooting back out of your mouth, but that is what you get with any irrigator.  The BIG PLUS here is how portable it is and that you don&#x27;t need to plug it in.  Also can use in the shower if you like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; One day after lots of use mine stopped shooting water but I simply pulled the two sections apart, and reattached the little tube hose. It works great once again and no problems since. Great item and I recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> This unit is good for traveling, but not for home use. The whole unit is what you see here -- the resevoir is the blue bottom. The white top houses the battery. Yes, it is battery operated and the resevoir is very small. I returned it to get the Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet instead.</li>
    <li> I bought this in early January 2006.  I bought it for trips when I didn&#x27;t have access to my Hydrofloss, to which I am addicted.  It worked ok, but was annoying to have to fill it up twice for each use, and the batteries didn&#x27;t last long. Then last week it stopped working about two weeks after the warrany ran out.</li>
    <li> Operation is fine as long as the batteries are good. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After two or three runs, energy declines. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Does not work with Acccumulators. They have to little power. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;but looks very solid and reliable. &lt;br /&gt;Tank could be larger.</li>
    <li> It seems that nobody can get these \\&quot;oral irrigators\\&quot; right.  The Waterpik portable device is a disaster; the batteries are gone within a year. THis Panasonic model does hold a charge (so far); it certainly lasts longer than the few times that one reviewer reports.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROs&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side, Panasonic designed this so that you can fill it horizontally--no more struggling to angle the device (as with the Waterpik) to get enough water in it.  One tank lasts about 35 seconds, enough to quickly do one&#x27;s mouth. However, for a more thorough job, you&#x27;ll probably want to fill it twice--not a big deal. It does a fairly good job of cleaning, more on that in the next section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONs&lt;br /&gt;Pressure, Pressure, Pressure.  As others have noted here, this model does not deliver the water pressure of many of the Waterpic models--even the horrid portable Waterpic delivers more power. THerefore, after a few weeks using it, my impression is that it does not blast away particulates, etc. as well as one should reasonably expect.  It gives a nice massaging feeling, and those with sensitive gums might appreciate the lower pressure, but it only does an adequate job as a flosser.  Of course, you should ask your dentist! FOr the money, not bad, but the Waterpik \\&quot;Ultra,\\&quot; though more expensive (over $50) may be the better buy in the long run (please see the many reviews for it here at Amazon.com).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now, my recommendation is to wait until someone builds a better irrigator, especially if you don&#x27;t have the space or the money to spend on the Waterpik Ultra.  Reach makes a very good, very cheap flosser that&#x27;s a handle with disposable flossing units that snap into it: http://www.amazon.com/Reach-Access-Flosser-Family-Refill/dp/B000GGKPRQ/sr&#x3D;1-13/qid&#x3D;1172205923/ref&#x3D;sr_1_13/002-5549519-4589615?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;s&#x3D;hpc.  Unlike other handheld flossers, the string doesn&#x27;t break in your mouth, and it&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I had the rechargable water pik, it lasted about a year and would not take a charge. The Panasonic uses 2 AA batteries. I have had it for several months and have yet to replace the batteries. I use it several times a day. A much better unit, no need to regharge, just replace the batteries.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. My wife and I both use it. It keeps out mouth really clean. we love it.</li>
    <li> My experience with this irrigator has been good. It could have some more power and a larger water tank. By far the best benefit of this product is its ability to being portable. It suits my needs and cleans like a champ.</li>
    <li> Great product for travel, it is small and compact, easy to handle and does a great job. I am very happy with it and recommend buying it.</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THE PANASONIC UNIT AND HAVE BEEN VERY PLEASED WITH THE PERFORMANCE.  THE BATTERY LIFE IS VERY GOOD AND THE UNIT DESIGN AND USABILITY IS VERY GOOD.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a \\&quot;Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet\\&quot; for more than two years. I really can&#x27;t live without it, so I bought this one when I travel. It works okay, but nowhere near the waterpik. The water pressure is very low, and you have to fill in water several times.     I&#x27;m not complaining. It&#x27;s small, easy to carry, and uses AA battery--no worries of international voltage change. I won&#x27;t like it if I have to use it every day, but once a while, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
    <li> Excellent product; well designed; good water pressure and battery life ... far superior to the rechargable waterpik product (I&#x27;ve owned both).</li>
    <li> I purchased this item after a long search of other similar items.  Originally thought it was going to be quite messy &amp; I would use it in the shower.  That is NOT the case.  It is very easy to use and not messy at all. You need to fill the unit about 3 times for a complete cleaning of your teeth, but that is not a problem at all.    Works great, I guess the Panasonic Name says it all. I understand it is much better than the \\&quot;Water Pic\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I like and use it a lot, but factoring in the cost of batteries, it becomes kind of expensive to use. I wish there was a corded version of it.</li>
    <li> I was expecting the force of the spray to be adjustible, as it is for my standard waterpik.  I was stunned when I first turned it on and found that it could shoot water 10 feet across the room.    Great for terrorizing my cats.  Completely useless for my mouth.</li>
    <li> It ran out of water before I even finished the first half of one side of my mouth.  And there was so little oomph in the water pressure, that I might as well have just rinsed my mouth with water from the tap.I used fresh Panasonic batteries as the directions said, and got such poor results that now, I&#x27;m just directing the spray from my shower head onto my teeth, and that&#x27;s better than using the oral irrigator.  I received a full refund from the supplier through Amazon, and that was very nice.  I will certainly order more from Amazon, but NOT an oral irrigator.</li>
    <li> This is a great device. It works fine for 12 months so far and is still going strong. My daughter went through two oral irrigators by Waterpik in less than a year. Not that she didn&#x27;t take good care of them. They just died out of no reasons. So Panasonic is the way to go! Two AA batteries last quite a while too.</li>
    <li> it worked ok when it worked I guess, but even then the only way to know I was getting full power was to use a fresh set of batteries every day.  Plus it died completely after a couple of months.  Standard rechargeable batteries seem like a good idea but the charge and performance is so variable and unreliable that for anything more demanding than a remote control for your TV you are better off with a cord.  Where that is impossible, such as a digital camera, go with a camera with a custom polymer battery.  Since the product won&#x27;t work without it they have to make it somewhat decent.   For something like this irrigator at least if it doesn&#x27;t work with a cord you will know that it is the device and not the batteries.</li>
    <li> Very good product; easy to fill and has good pressure.  Time will tell if it&#x27;s more dependable than the WaterPik portable dental jet. I&#x27;ve had 2 of those that didn&#x27;t last a year, but I&#x27;m very pleased with the Panasonic so far.</li>
    <li> The Panasonic EW1270AC is a fine portable irrigator. It has adequate power, pulsates rapidly (faster than my waterpik on setting 5, the setting I use), collaspes into itself for small storage, and uses replacable AA batteries. All of which make it perfectly suited for travel.     Now dont forget this thing is not plugged into the wall like your waterpik, so you cant expect it to be as powerful. The blue water resevoir detaches from the white upper part so that it can be cleaned and completely dried out; from reading other reviews, some other people dont seem to be aware of this. There is even a place to store the long tip on the side of the device so it wont get lost or broken in your bag/suitcase.    This will not out perform or equal a waterpik, but is pretty decent when your not at home. I recommend getting one of these if you travel often and feel like you need to use an oral irrigator. Also, I would get some re-chargeable batteries as it will get expensive in the long run if you dont.     Lastly, to open the battery compartment, I washed a nickel and use that to open the large \\&quot;screw\\&quot; on top of the device, the nickel fits perfectly in the slot.</li>
    <li> The product is excellent but should have a bigge water reservoir....  It&#x27;s compact and has a very good water pressure.</li>
    <li> Purchased this irrigator after my dentist recommended it . I&#x27;m not the best at using floss under my bridges and he suggested this particular product. It does exactly what he said.. Works fine, has enough force to clean without any problem. It&#x27;s easy to use and a good bargain for the price. I do have to fill it up twice to thoroughly clean, but that&#x27;s not a big deal.  I like the fact that it&#x27;s portable and compact . No units to clog up space on my washstand in the bathroom.  It&#x27;s a good deal... Get it !!</li>
    <li> Good for travel with limitations.But cannot do without it when I travel internationally. Not ideal but a great substitute when traveling! I cannot do without it. So far have not found a more ideal one.....it is not as good as the one I have at home but when traveling have not been able to find a more compact &amp; more effefecve one. Would be happy if something as  good as a home one was available for travel!?</li>
    <li> The irrigator works quite well. It is small enough to reach to the back of the mouth; the water reserve is good for maybe 1/2 of a mouth rinse. The 20 minutes in the description refers to the battery life; one charge lasts for a couple of weeks of use (I am using rechargeable batteries).  UPDATE: seal between pick and resorvoir has worn out after 6 months of use, and water now sprays and leaks from the bottom of the pick. Downgraded to 2 stars.</li>
    <li> Love this product as a portable with the proviso that it is just that, portable with limited power but in a pinch and for travel it is a great second to my HydroFloss which I would replace the minute it failed.  The Panasonic allows me to travel abroad with something guaranteed to get the food out between my braces.  Mind you, I am an adult with braces who does a lot of public speaking attending a lot of business meetings so I cannot afford to go with hairy teeth from a salad or spinach dish.  You all know what I mean.  My periodontist loves the combined effect of my travel Panasonic and my HydroFloss.</li>
    <li> I had been using a water pik at home for years and needed a compact one to bring on vacation. I was so pleased with it on vacation that I am throwing away my old bulky water pik and using the portable one exclusively.</li>
    <li> Despite the negative reviews for the rechargeable Water Pik, I tried it because it was rechargeable and had a slightly larger water reservoir than the Panasonic. They were right, I was wrong. The Water Pik&#x27;s pressure fluctuated wildly, and the battery died after about 4 months. The Panasonic works beautifully. Pressure is higher, it&#x27;s quieter and more compact. I use Ni-Mh batteries and recharge once a week. So far it&#x27;s all pro and no con.</li>
    <li> I will use this oral irrigator almost every day, but control of this product is a bit iffy.  You are not supposed to irrigate your tongue or throat, but the irrigator seems to have a mind of its own.  Still, for the price, this product has real value and I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I bought this a couple years ago and it&#x27;s great.  No problems with it, batteries last a long time, plenty of water pressure to clean the crud out of your teeth.  Small enough to pack in your carry-on and I recommend it to everyone who travels.</li>
    <li> This is a great little irrigator.  It&#x27;s portable...fits in my travel toiletry bag and is relatively strong, considering its size.  I like to use this instead of flossing and it seems to work fine for me.  But my dentist still recommends flossing so I try to floss every once in a while.  I&#x27;ve had it for five years now and use it every time I travel (at least 3 per year) and it&#x27;s held up fine.  I take the batteries out after every use so they don&#x27;t corrode between uses.  Sometimes I need to refill, but it&#x27;s a small price to pay for the convenience.  If you&#x27;re looking for an oral irrigator for daily use, I&#x27;d recommend something bigger that plugs in so that you don&#x27;t have to worry about refilling the water and changing the batteries.  But for travel, this thing&#x27;s perfect!</li>
    <li> UNIT WORKED GOOD THE ONLY PROBLEM I SAW WAS THAT WATER CAP COMES OFF WHEN CLEANING IT AFTER I USED IT . IT GOES BACK ON WITH NO PROBLEM. BATTERYS LAST LONG.I ONLY USE IT 3 TIMES A WEEK. UP DATE ITS NOW 7 YEARS LATER STILL WORKS FINE I DO PULL BOTTOM HALF OFF TO CLEAN IT GOOD IN SIDE.</li>
    <li> Prior to obtaining this product I had used a similar device made by Waterpik.  That one paled in comparison to Panasonic&#x27;s product.  With the use of some rechargeable batteries this irrigator lasted me for many weeks before needing a recharge.  My only complaint is that it has no speed modulation and it is almost too powerful.  It certainly gets the job done though.</li>
    <li> My wife and I use a 110 VAC WaterPik daily.  We purchased this Panasonic battery-powered device to accompany us on a recent cruise because it is smaller and more compact than the WaterPik.  The unit works well, but it is not as powerful as our 110 VAC unit.  It take two, or three, fillings to complete its job, but that&#x27;s certainly not a real drawback.  We find it very useful as a travel companion, but I wouldn&#x27;t want to use it as a replacement for our more powerful WaterPik.</li>
    <li> I have had a lot of trouble keeping food out of the space between two crowns, as well as other cracks and crevases in my mouth.  This product was very easy to use, and worked very well.  I was afraid when the label said \\&quot;bleeding\\&quot;, but I suffered no ill effects whatsoever.  It can shoot water all over if you are not careful, and you need to refill it after cleaning two or three teeth, but it is worth it.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Worked when I first put the batteries in -- but when I tried to use it the first time, it didn&#x27;t work.  Tried three sets of batteries - still didn&#x27;t wor!!</li>
    <li> This is my 4th one for my mother in-law. She took my advise and tried it for better oral cleaning. She loved it as my sons, my wife and myself. Price is lower than the first one I bought few years ago.</li>
    <li> Perfect little item to put in a suitcase when going away.  The intensity of the water stream is pretty good and does the job.  I have to fill the tank 3-4 times.  It&#x27;s easy to do and takes just a second.  I suggest that you pry open the package carefully and use it to pack it when going away.  The plastic packaging is a perfect protector of this little appliance when packed in a suitcase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT USE THIS AT HOME.  If you&#x27;re serious about maintaining dental health, you&#x27;ll use a full-size water pik at home.  I am currently using this one and think it&#x27;s great:  Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet.  Bought it here in amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  bought it February 2008.  Used it 20 times maybe.  By the summer of 2010, it stopped working.  Tried multiple sets of fresh batteries.  Buh-bye.</li>
    <li> perhaps be a bit handy so as to be able to reconnect the tube which sumps the irrigating liquid from bottom of the resevoir into the bottom of the chassis: not a feature of the previous model.</li>
    <li> As I have aged my teeth are separating and a toothbrush, even the expensive sonic ones, do not get the stuff between my teeth. I had one of these and miss placed it and that was why I purchased another. It is wonderful to carry with me if I go out and get the food stuck and it hurts sometimes. This does the trick. Amazon had the best price and S&amp;H. Give it a try. You have to work with it so not to bathe yourself but once you figure it out you will not want to be without it again!</li>
    <li> I agree with a lot of the positive reviews in that the portability of this product is great.  It is much weaker than the Waterpik unit I have at home.  I have had no problems with the battery life.  I usually have to refill the reservoir once to get a full mouth clean, but b/c it is so quick to refill it is not too much of a problem.  I also recommend keeping one at work for emergency food removal.</li>
    <li> We received the Panasonic Oral Irrigator and immediately tried it out.  My wife has implants and a bar to secure her lower denture, and flossing can be a problem.  This device makes short work of cleaning out under and around the bar and implants. It is convenient and effective, and takes only one fill of the reservoir. She wishes we had ordered this months ago.  I heartily recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product. It is small and easy to travel with. It works well. You do need to fill it twice to get a good cleaning job.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item because it works on rechargeable batteries and does not have to take up space on the counter top while recharging. Also, most built in rechargeable batteries, I have found, seem to start loosing their power after a year or less. I have lots of AA Rechargeables since my digital camera uses them!     Yes, you need to fill the tank 3 or 4 times to clean all your teeth. BUT, I have used this Panasonic Irrigator about 20 times and I have always had food particles removed from my teeth.    I bought it to keep my teeth free of food particles and it does a great job. The small size is a bonus! With the extra tips that I purchased, my wife gets to use it also!</li>
    <li> I have used this product on my vacation in Egypt for two weeks, it work great, power is adequated with rechargeable batteries, I wish the unit should came with two picks, one pick is wrong for over all classes, indicated so cheap in everyway, I gave it 2 stars because for that, if come with 2-picks, it should be in the 4-stars categories, because for travel peoples normally at least two peoples involved. Panasonic, don&#x27;t be so cheap! show some class!!</li>
    <li> The jet is not strong enough for my liking (does not work on pineapple for example!)</li>
    <li> An honest review, from 2 satisfied, long-term customers . . .    Same as flossing, only different. MUCH better.    My wife and I have used 5 of these over a 10+ year span (some were an earlier model, round &amp; small). After about 2-3 years of use the motor brushes wear down, and after a few fits and starts a replacement is ordered. Amazon has always had them for $30, so, it costs around $1/month.     If you have braces or any dental work, you should just flat-out get one.    The \\&quot;20 minutes\\&quot; spec is how long a pair of AA batt&#x27;s will run the pump at full strength. So, 40 seconds of use each day will run them low in a month or so. You can keep using them, they&#x27;re just weaker. We recycle batteries.    I cannot imagine going anywhere without it. I have another at work for use after lunch.    You&#x27;ll stand agog, watching &#x27;fresh garbage&#x27; tumble into the sink. You don&#x27;t want this gunk in your mouth; you know what it turns into (and smells like). You just never got to see it up close until now. Whether to refill it or not depends on whether it&#x27;s still pulling chunks of food out of your mouth. Meat, bacon, popcorn, fish, seeds, nuts, candy, spices, veggies, etc., no longer held in limbo.    Don&#x27;t touch the plastic tip directly to your teeth to completely eliminate any scratches. It is considered a &#x27;personal&#x27; device, but we both use the same one. 1-year warranty.    Rechargeable Ni-Mh batteries at 1.2 volts have less &#x27;oomph&#x27; -- an Akaline&#x27;s voltage is 25-30% higher, so the pump works harder. Your choice.    So, if using alkaline batteries makes it too strong for you to take, switch to rechargeables or some weak alkalines (and NEVER mix battery types). Later, when your gums are healthier, you can step up to a stronger stream. The purpose of the EW1270AC is to clean and strengthen your gums, and I find it does a super job.    If you&#x27;ll take my advice for a terrific toothbrush, I prefer the Cybersonic 2 (or #3) Oralcare System Toothbrush ($30 or $50, 110V charging stand, Amazon). We&#x27;ve had 5 of these things over 10+ years (we have a #2 and a #3 right now). Got our first one as a birthday present. I was amazed the first time I used it - got a funky taste in my mouth that got stronger and stronger after 2 minutes of brushing as it pulled off crud that my old toothbrush had left behind. Been using Cybersonics ever since.  Imagine a powerful tuning fork with an ordinary brush humming on the end. Two fresh snap-on brushes arrive in the mail every 3 months (for $5, which also pays for the warranty coverage). You&#x27;ll find that ordinary electric toothbrushes cost a lot of $$$ for complicated replacement brushes, so they don&#x27;t get changed.  After about 5 years, the internal batteries won&#x27;t hold much charge, it&#x27;s sealed watertight so you can&#x27;t replace them. Your warranty buys you a new one; you pay $10 S&amp;H. For fresh brushes and the cleanest mouth I could possibly have, the two together cost 10 cents/day (with high power Ni-Mh). Cheap. I hope they make both of these for a long, long time.    We can not imagine going anywhere without both of them (read, they both travel very well on vacations).  And my hygenist isn&#x27;t flirting with me -- my mouth really is very clean. She always hands me a complimentary toothbrush and travel toothpaste, and I always hand the toothbrush back.</li>
    <li> The device fell off the sink onto the bathroom floor AND BROKE!!!!!  The plastic is so brittle it can&#x27;t take a simple spill.  I am very disappointed.  My suggestion: KEEP AWAY from this product.</li>
    <li> This is a quality product, and the sellers quality people! THanks for the smooth transaction! :)</li>
    <li> This is the second type of oral irrigator I have purchased.  The first one was an Oral B, had to be plugged in, and was inoperable after five months.  I had a design flaw with the plug-in charge system which allowed the electrical connection to get wet and it became inoperable. The Panasonic is much more user friendly, and since it operates on batteries, is not a pain to have on the sink top.  Most importantly, it works very well, has lots of energy to pulsate the water, and I love it!</li>
    <li> Got this after having two waterpics - the large canister w/hose AC driven one, and the portable type. The canister unit finally leaked too badly to use any more, and the portable has loose heads that prevent you from controling the spray effectively. This unit works great and the heads are stable so you can aim at a specific area or tooth. The only downside is it&#x27;s consumption of batteries. You can buy rechargeables but then you need to pack a charger when you travel. The irrigator breaks down to a nice compact unit for packing.</li>
    <li> I bought this irrigator in 9/08 and have used it everyday. My last dental exam in Feb showed a dramatic improvement in the gum pockets varying 1 to 3mm. Prior to this I never had an improvement only a  slow degrading in depth of the gum pockets. My remaining teeth feel more firm in their sockets. This unit is perfect for me at home or on the road, it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all to refill while using - takes less than a minute. I am on the same battery since I bought it - cheap enough for me.</li>
    <li> I own the PANASONIC irrigator since the earlier model with a smaller  tank. I got this one because the older  died on me.  It is perfect to clean my  bridges. I don&#x27;t use bridge threads because it hurts my gums and it is too difficult  to use. With this  irrigator my bridges are always clean and the water pressure is perfect; not too strong and not too soft (unless the batteries are dying). I have to refill the tank two  or three times during cleaning but it is normal  if you  want  to do a very good irrigation between teeth. It is worth the $23-$26 and you can take it anywhere; it is  not too big and it takes  two AA batteries.</li>
    <li> First time user of a water irrigator. I found it very portable, easy to use, and more power than expected. Only wish is that it had a medium/low setting because I got it mainly to clean a wisdom tooth that is half missing until I get it fixed. It is more than adequate.</li>
    <li> Panasonic EW1270AC Portable Oral Irrigator is outstanding Product     Pro- Easy to use. Works great. Super high preassure.     Con- None    Worth every penny you spend for it.</li>
    <li> Pefect replacement for standard electric.  All you need are rechargeable batteries.  Strong pluse, more than adaquet water capacity.  Mechanically very sound. Uses minimal battery capacity with each use.  Recommend rechargeable batteries, regular batteries are some times weak off shelf.</li>
    <li> Oral irrigators like this give your mouth a clean feeling, and your dentist will smile upon you as well (they do a good job of getting rid of gunk between the teeth and at the gumline that would otherwise turn into tartar). &lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;This unit is compact and fits together well. The motor nests into the water tank when not in use, and a quick tug is all you need to pull it out. It&#x27;s easy to hold and well designed. The only flaw is that you&#x27;ll need to refill the water tank during use, because it doesn&#x27;t really hold enough to go over your entire mouth (it&#x27;s not 20 minutes worth of water as the editorial review says above - more like 40 seconds), but this is simple - flip open a little piece of plastic and run water into the hole, then flip it closed and continue.</li>
    <li> When this instrument worked, it was wonderful, however, it just stopped working and it could not be fixed.  It lasted about 2 months.</li>
    <li> I was told by my dentist that I was going to need surgery to stop my bleedy gums (because of an abscis or pocket?).  I decided to try this product to see if I could stop the bleeding without surgery by using the jet to clean out the pocket.  AFTER ONE DAY OF USE, bleeding almost went to nil.  After one week, I don&#x27;t see any bleeding when brushing.  The clean feeling you get after using this product is great.  This could possibly be the best product I have ever bought for my health.  This is definitely something people should buy if they have gum problems.</li>
    <li> A very good product that does the job well.  I have been using it for more than 2 months and it cleans my teeth well.  At first I made a mess with water all over the sink, but I have managed much better now.  The unit is very convenient to pack for traveling, however, the batteries run out pretty fast but I overcame the problem by using rechargeable NiMh batteries.  The water tank is small but I don&#x27;t mind to fill up the tank again, it just takes a few seconds.</li>
    <li> The unit works well, perhaps too well.  There is only one level of water pressure- hard.  I&#x27;m worried I&#x27;m going to knock something loose.  I wish there was a gentle setting. It is quiet though, something the bigger units haven&#x27;t figured out.</li>
    <li> Not much power, but it does the job.  Tip seems to be a flimsy. Used it for 18 day trip to China with wife on one set of batteries.</li>
    <li> It was time for a change since my third waterpik broke (to be fair, that was over a span of several years). I intended to use it mostly as a backup when I buy another plugin irrigator, but it&#x27;s been doing so well I haven&#x27;t bought a replacement plugin one yet. I&#x27;ve been using for two months now and I would recommend it.     Pro: Very compact compared to a plug in one. No high pressure hose line to break (a major fault in waterpiks). Powerful enough. Well constructed.    Con: Need to refill at least twice and possible more for each cleaning (depending on how fast you move that nozzle around). No pressure control. Pressure varies with battery power. Refill opening cover gets lot of use - it&#x27;s a snap lid.    Update Nov 2008: It keeps on going, and going... Using it everyday and on travel and haven&#x27;t even thought about buying a Water-pik again. Hint: use a high capacity rechargeable (&gt;2500man) - makes a BIG difference.</li>
    <li> Only had it 10 days or so, but so far it seems great. Fast and easy to use so you&#x27;ll actually use it. Definitely strong enough. Can&#x27;t say anything about battery life... I&#x27;ve only used it 8-10 times, but it&#x27;s definitely still strong enough. I really like it. would definitely recommend it</li>
    <li> Light, easy to carry and take anywhere. Does a great job massaging at the gum line. I take it to work and on trips; no cord and doesn&#x27;t take up much space. The tank holds just enough water to do an effective job.</li>
    <li> Researched for a replacement for my old WaterPik, and came across this portable Oral Irrigator. Found lots of complaints about poor quality in the current WaterPik line. This Panasonic had many positive reviews and it was portable. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The irragator has performed flawlessly over the last two months. Batteries last about a month with daily use. &lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is a small water tank, although it does fill up very easily. Compared to my old waterPik, it is down on pressure. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It works well and is quiet. Just needs a bit more punch.</li>
    <li> When the dendist said I had a few deep pockets and he wanted around $400 to treat it, I bought a Sonicare 7500 and one of these.  I have used it twice a day for a few months the batteries are just now showing a reduced power (maybe time to change them - but it still shoots water over 10 yards).  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My follow up pre-treatment visit indicated the deep pockets had reduced in size by half.  Long story short, I showed the dentist this unit and he was impressed.  I am too. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Yes, it isn&#x27;t a WaterPic, and it doesn&#x27;t have the big resivor of a WaterPic.  If I wanted something like a WaterPic I would have gotten it.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I wanted something small enough to pack in my shave kit and effectively blast what I can&#x27;t get with a toothpick.  As mentioned by someone earlier, you can see the food particles falling into the sink when using it. I don&#x27;t need to spend much time with this after a 2.5 minute brushing with the Sonicare.  I have adjusted my usage to match pretty close a complete tank (hitting inside and outside between all teeth).    &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you travel and you want something like a (short water supply) WaterPic - get this unit.  As mentioned by others it doesn&#x27;t hold enough water for a 20 minute irrigation - but as I said, I got over it and adjusted for it (I don&#x27;t know if even a WaterPic holds 20 minutes of water.  If I wanted to flush for 20 minutes, I&#x27;d connect a valve, hose and mini-nozzle into the 65# pressure home water supply. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One last comment: Use warm water for a better experience; cold water just doen&#x27;t feel right.</li>
    <li> I bought this unit from Sharper Image because their description led me to believe that it would be better than traditional flossing.  The product manual, however, instructs that the oral irrigator should be used in conjunction with flossing, which seems redundant.  I went to using it regularly, but after a few weeks I felt that my teeth were not as clean as they were with floss, and after flossing I found a good deal of build-up.  Maybe I wasn&#x27;t using it properly, since it seems that a lot of people give this unit high marks, but I just didn&#x27;t find it helpful.  Try the Reach Access Daily Flosser, which I found is much more effective.</li>
    <li> I was a little cynical about the effectiveness of gadgets like this, but after using it, i am satisfied that it does what it proclaims. Regular use of this product should keep your gums healthy and food particles out of the gaps between the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The make and quality of this product is just top class. The material feels like soft rubber and you know its high grade plastic. Very well made and of course its one of those rare items, because its \\&quot;Made in Japan\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Outanding product. Puts Portable Waterpic to shame.  Battery operated unit is much more convenient and reliable than the rechargeable Waterpic (the Waterpic portables die in under a year - I went through 3 of them!)  Also, the Panasonic portable irrigator collapses conveniently for travel - a very nice feature and the reason to have a portable.  Finally, the pressure issued by the Panasonic is more uniform than the Waterpic, and gentle but firm.  I will now replace my sink-side Waterpic (the large one) with the Panasonic.</li>
    <li> The Panasonic provides adequate power in a collapsing, portable design. I wish that the water reservoir was a bit bigger, but that would, of course increase the overall size, so making it larger probably would not be practical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it stands, one filling usually provides just about enough water for a fairly good cleaning. Battery life has been pretty good so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As one of my dentists once said, oral irrigators are even more important than brushing and dental floss can actually force food under the gums, creating all kinds of problems.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use and so far I haven&#x27;t had to change a battery.  It is very gentle but removes food between brushings.  I use in between brushings and flossings, and it just feels good!</li>
    <li> This irrigator works really well. One important feature: you can easily replace the AA batteries when they run down, unlike the Waterpik portable irrigator, which I had to throw away when the Ni-cad battery would&#x27;nt hold a charge. This unit is compact, just the right size for travelling.</li>
    <li> I like this oral irrigator.  It doesn&#x27;t hold much water (you have to fill it up at least two times during use), but it really does the job, it&#x27;s easy to use and I can be quick about it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been through 4 or 5 portable oral irrigators in the past ten years.  The first ones I bought from Panasonic were quite weak and ceased to work within a year or so - changing the batteries didn&#x27;t help!  So I discarded them and went for a hand pump kind, but when that broke I went back to Panasonic - this model works better than their original model.  The pulse is stronger, it&#x27;s easy to fill, and hasn&#x27;t died on me yet.  So I&#x27;m hopeful it&#x27;ll last more than a year!</li>
    <li> My experience corroborates what earlier reviewers said:  It&#x27;s more powerful and easier to pack than a compact Interplak portable I&#x27;d used previously; it delivers as much power as my full-size, countertop Waterpik; and you need to refill it at least twice during each use.  But it delivers exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t like to floss or dont floss much, this thing is good. Unlike the &#x27;pik, its more compact and less cluttersome, which means you might actually use the thing. Good for small apts like mine. I like the fact that it stores in itself, making it a great travel item too.     You do have to fill it a couple of times to get thorough. I typicall fill it 3 to 4 times to ensure I work around each tooth. The pressure isn&#x27;t too strong, but that&#x27;s a good thing. You can actually damage your gums if the pressure is too strong. It does what its suppose to do nicely. I would like a setting to increase the pressure but that might be asking too much. :)</li>
    <li> Wish I got his when I wear braces a decade ago.. I don&#x27;t think is that helpful for non braces user.. Floss does better job overall over this, mainly because the hardest part of the teeth only floss can take it out not this, it doesn&#x27;t had enought water so you had to refill water often.  It might hard to use it, travel is good but careful not make a mess lol</li>
    <li> Portable for trips, but I think it should have a larger reservoir. For battery powered unit, it&#x27;s great for the money.</li>
    <li> I love the Panasonic Portable Oral Irrigator so much that I purchased this one as a backup in case something happens to the one I am curently using. I love how it leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean, and I know I am doing something really, really good for my teeth and gums. I rate the oral irrigator as 5 stars!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent oral irrigator for travel. It is not as powerful or versatile as an OralBreeze or corded WaterPik, which would be the first choice to keep in your bathroom at home. But my gums suffer if I travel for very long without my irrigator, and this is a perfect choice for travel. Works just fine: pressure is adequate, tank size is sufficient, collapses to a compact size.</li>
    <li> never knew how much was left behind after brushing.  My mouth feels so much cleaner and it&#x27;s great if you have bridge work it gets under it very good.  Love my Panasonic portable Irrigator.  Getting for both my daughters for christmas.</li>
    <li> I have had a Waterpik portable and a Panasonic portable. My first was a Waterpik. It worked well. My present Panasonic seems to work just as well, it seems. It is nice, since you never have to plug it in. I have a battery charger, so batteries are no problem. I think I have had it about a month, now, and it is still running on the original charged batteries. I recommend it highly!  Sincerely, John D. Jacoby</li>
    <li> I just recently got a permanent dental bridge &amp; when at home I use a water pik to make sure to clean under the bridge, but when traveling I needed something to take along.  The Panosonic Portable Oral Irrigator worked very well to get the area under my bridge clean of food debris.  It often needs to be refilled as the reservoir is not that large but it is a very convenient product and I am completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> This is really a fine product.  It&#x27;s portable, it&#x27;s powerful, and it works.  Read through all the reviews and then ask yourself, \\&quot;Do I want a reasonably priced irrigator that does the job?\\&quot;</li>
    <li> This is my first experience using this type of product. After using the Panasonic Oral Irrigator a couple of times a day for three months, I went for a routine dental checkup. As the hygienist was cleaning my teeth, I noticed that I could barely feel it. In recent years my teeth have become quite sensitive, so I usually dread seeing the dental hygienist. She asked me what I was doing differently, and I told her about my Panasonic. She told me to keep using it because my gums were so pink and healthy. On my previous visit I had been told that my gums had inflammation even though I was using a Sonicare toothbrush and flossing.     Now that I am accustomed to using this product, I would not want to be without it. An electric toothbrush and flossing are not enough. After I brush my teeth and floss, I use the Panasonic Oral Irrigator, and I am amazed that additional debris is almost always removed by the Irrigator. Furthermore, your teeth will always feel as clean as they do after a professional cleaning. This product is a bargain and very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how people live without one of these. Unfortunately, I left mine in a hotel in Cabo San Lucas and don&#x27;t want to bother trying to have it mailed back. It has been a week and I have to buy another one. I&#x27;m used to the fresh feeling that a toothbrush, toothpaste and mouthwash don&#x27;t leave. The Panasonic leaves my mouth feeling CLEAN. I also had the &#x27;Grossan Original Throat Irrigator&#x27; to remove any tonsiloliths (throat stones).  It is quite pricey, $17, but worth it. It attaches perfectly to the Panasonic. The Panasonic doesn&#x27;t not hold much water and you will have to fill it about two times when using, but who cares? After a while it will get dirty, but you can take it apart and wash it.</li>
    <li> I have had these Panasonic irrigators for many years.  They have been great. This particular one was a dud. It only worked for a few days</li>
    <li> I purchased the Panasonic oral irrigator after reading other positive reviews.  The water pressure isn&#x27;t as foreceful as my Water Pik countertop unit, but it&#x27;s still pretty strong, in my opinion.  Does a good job at dislodging food from my braces, very portable, and I paid less than $30 for it on Amazon.  Keep in mind, this is a Portable unit.  I need to fill the resevoir once or twice to get the job done, and there is only one speed setting.  I am still satisfied with my purchase, and would recommend this product to anyone looking for a Portable oral irrigator.</li>
    <li> Yes, I know.  It says irritator and not irrigator.  This was intentional.  While the unit worked well for a time, it exploded during use and caused me eye and facial damage.  The pieces of the device were scattered throughout the bathroom.  I am contacting Panasonic to seek compensation.</li>
    <li> This item is compact, easily assembled, simple to use, not messy, and does a good job irrigating between the teeth.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s portable, waterproof, easy to use, large tank, 1-2 fill is enough to clean teeth, I use rechargeable batteries, no problem, I would recommend this product. My dentist was impressed.</li>
    <li> Have been using this irrigator for three weeks and still on same set of batteries. So far I am very pleased with the cleaning, simplicity of use and since I travel extensively internationally, love the light weight. Previously I used an Portable (charging unit) Waterpik which added extra weight and space to luggage. Saving weight anywhere these days is a plus. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So for the first three weeks, this is a great product!</li>
    <li> This unit functions very well. It would be much better if it had a stronger pulse option.</li>
    <li> I have braces and I travel for work.  I purchased this to use when I travel.  It gets the job done.  The pressure is pretty good.  I wouldn&#x27;t use it as a my main device at home.  It is compact and fits easily into my carry on.  I also travel with a Sonicare, both cases are about the same size.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s powerful and easy to use. No problem so far. I will buy another one for my wife.</li>
    <li> For the price it does a very good job. It is a bit tedious to have to refill water after about 30-40 seconds, but not having to have a cumbersome unit makes it worth the hassle. Does a good job cleaning and massaging - definitely good for travel.</li>
    <li> Panasonic Portable Irrigator works very well and fits into my medicine cabinet, so it&#x27;s out of sight. It has to be filled 2 times for a good cleaning but I don&#x27;t mind at all. The fact that it works well,  has no wires and can be tucked away(no clutter) is just what I wanted. I reccommend it highly.</li>
    <li> Purchased this item and am very pleased with it.  It does the job and meets my needs for my oral hygiene.  The product reviews said what it was supposed to do and it does.</li>
    <li> This is my second Panasonic Oral Irrigator.  I had great use of my first one.  I love having a compact oral irrigator handy when   away from home.</li>
    <li> This is the right idea, but horrible at execution.  No power at all no matter what angle.  You are truly better off gargling than using this.  I thoroughly regret buying this.</li>
    <li> I bought this unit with not much expectation when it was the \\&quot;deal of the day\\&quot;. I was very impressed when I received the unit to find its build quality/construction was very good, and impressed with the way the whole works. Not only is the design very well thought out, but the unit actually works- So I give this device a 5 star rating for Price, build Quality of item, and product usability. I keep this at work, would also work great on vacation, &amp; business trips because it is really compact and the bigger waterpik wouldn&#x27;t be practical to lug with you.</li>
    <li> This is the best for eithor at home or travel.  I will buy another if needed.</li>
    <li> Have three of three in the last 2 years; It is great (but one has to keep fresh batteries in it,obviously,or the water pressure can be limited after the battery powers down); I wish there were some method to chemically clean the inside as depending on the state of ones water (I live in NYC where the water is Good, actually) but probably with a fair amount of chem&#x27;s and I suspect ,over a shorter period than I would like-that the Interior gets a bit of   &#x27;brown stuff&#x27; (don&#x27;t ask me what it is) but to try to avoid this, I leave the little cover open and this helps dry out the inner water chamber and its parts.  I have NEVER had a good experience with the corded Water Pics which are awkward and so on so THIS IS IT.    Good product, but one has to dispose of it when the interior (which I&#x27;d love to figure out how to effectivey clean!)</li>
    <li> I purchased the Panasonic irrigator 2 years ago. It is a good product when it works. Mine stopped working some months ago. I could not repair it. As I needed it urgently, I now bought a second one - as I found no alternative. Per se not a good policy, I admit.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve had about 8 of these over the last 15 years (including an earlier model). It is indispensable -- I cannot imagine not having one wherever I go.  The battery voltage determines the strength of the water stream. Use rechargeables (1.25V) or old alkalines for lower water pressure, fresh alkalines (1.5V+) for more pressure.    We use &#x27;em twice a day, every day. After a couple of years, the motor brushes start to wear out and you have to tap the side to get them to work. That&#x27;s boring, so I just buy a couple more and get back to my life. (One at home, one at work for lunchtime.)    Some folks here complain about &#x27;the tank&#x27;s too small&#x27; (fill it twice), &#x27;the batteries don&#x27;t last&#x27; (they&#x27;re fine), &#x27;I like my waterpik&#x27; (had one - clunky, takes too much room and doesn&#x27;t travel well), &#x27;mine broke&#x27; (none of mine ever broke or leaked), and &#x27;it&#x27;s messy&#x27; (hold your mouth over the sink; it&#x27;s just like brushing). Go ahead and get one. You&#x27;ll be glad you did -- it&#x27;ll be the smartest 20 bucks you ever spent.    Use it every day and your dentist will be pleasantly surprised (mine always is). My gums are healthier, stronger and cleaner, and gum health is really what it&#x27;s all about. Not a total substitute for floss, but a grand sight better than nothing.    I cannot imagine not having one of them around at all times. Packs easily for travel, easy to clean and store, cheap at $21 (they used to be much higher), reliable (for a couple of years). Gets trapped food from between my teeth (I hate it when that happens!) and gets food residue that brushing just plain misses. There&#x27;s nothing else like it.</li>
    <li> I would buy this item again if I needed to.  The only thing that I do not like is that the reservoir is not big enough.  When you start to clean your teeth you have to refill the reservoir by the time you have finished either the top of bottom set of teeth.  You cannot clean your whole mouth at one time.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t think this will replace your countertop waterpik, but this machine&#x27;s perfect for travel. I have braces and can&#x27;t stand the feeling of food stuck in them between meals. This portable irrigator went a full week on a single pair of batteries and a single filling cleaned my braces out quickly. It&#x27;s not tiny, but well designed to minimize space while not in use.    I&#x27;d highly recommend it for anyone needing this type of travel companion.</li>
    <li> Am currently on my second home Water-Pik, but needed something convenient to use while travelling.  This Panasonic unit is compact, uses AA batteries , and is quick &amp; easy to use.  You can&#x27;t expect it to be comparable to the counter-top Water Pik...it is bulkier to hold, has a relatively small water reservoir, and isn&#x27;t as powerful, BUT it IS a worthy option for taking on trips. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It seems that some purchasers may have misunderstood the 20 minute run time issue.  Simply put: The reservoir may have to be refilled to do a thorough job at each use &amp; alkaline batteries may be consumed after about 20 total minutes of use, but those batteries have lasted well over 30 uses, so far, for me.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Unless you just want something smaller than the Water-Pik, because of the battery replace/recharge issue &amp; the less powerful water jet, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for daily home use although I&#x27;m sure some users might find it perfectly acceptable. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> This is the second irrigator like this that I&#x27;ve bought. My teen with braces needed the one my husband and I had been using for the last year. I really missed it- my gums did, too, so I ordered another one. It works great. I never floss and still get great checkups from my hygienist.</li>
    <li> I bought this bc my dentist said to get an oral irrigator for my gums bc they were showing the fist signs of periodontal disease. Many models required a plug in and we don&#x27;t have a outlet in my bathroom. We also have very little storage space (it&#x27;s an old house with a pedestal sink) so this one was great. It takes up very little space and runs on batteries. I use rechargeable batteries and only have to replace them every few months. My dentist said my gums looked great on the next visit.</li>
    <li> I had to replace a plug-in waterpik, read the Amazon poor ratings on most of the large 120V. models and decided to go with the Panasonic portable instead. It works excellently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic waterpik is small, one filling of water works fine to do all your teeth, is nicely made, collapses for travel and costs half of what big ones do.</li>
    <li> I love this item.  I&#x27;ve used a home version of this since I was 12 (I&#x27;m now 44).  I hated to go on an extended vacation without it and was very happy to find one.  It costs more than the one I have for home use, but sometimes you have to pay for convenience.  It holds plenty of water to complete a thorough cleaning job and travels very well.</li>
    <li> This is the second of these that we have purchased.  My husband travels a lot, so we needed two... one for me at home and one for him on the road.  We have had one problem with both of them.  A tiny part inside of the part where you put the water in seems to come loose and float in the water.  When this happens, no water will spray out of the nozzle.  So, my husband gets his big tweezers out, searches around in there for this little part and then puts it back in place.  This happens more often than we like.  But, we have also tried the Waterpik.  We did not like that one much.  It did not spray very well and did not work well at all if we put warm water in it.  The Panasonic is much more reliable and the spray is powerful and does a great job.  The batteries seem to last about 3 weeks with both of us using it.  Overall, this is a good product and I am pretty happy with it.</li>
    <li> I have used the previous mode for quite some time, before it finally quit working.  This model is even better, as it has a greater liquid capacity.  Highly reccommend.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my husband.  Good pressure. Handy for traveling. Pressure is not as good as the electric version but it gets the job done. This is his second one. The first one lasted for about 3 years.You just have to watch the refill cap - it will sometimes come off in your travel kit if you do not close it properly. I am getting one for myself.</li>
    <li> I wanted something portable since I travel a lot....this is perfect!  It holds a nice amount of water and the ease of assembly is great.  The only problem is the batteries wear down relatively quickly but that&#x27;s easily solved with rechargable batteries.</li>
    <li> I own both Waterpik and Panasonic. this one is really convenient I&#x27;ve been using at work and travelling. Presure is not an issue if you use rechargeable battery because it draws battery quickly. Very comfortable compared with Waterpik.</li>
    <li> good overall product, have had one for about 2 yrs. Only one speed, but is adequate for the job</li>
    <li> This item is tops.  Easily portable.  Quiet.  Works great.  Perfect for traveling!!  Can be used by kids more easily than a counter-top irrigator because of thumb on/off switch.  A good buy for sure!</li>
    <li> In short, it&#x27;s a toy... with a water stream that&#x27;s weak. It was a great disappointment.</li>
    <li> I use this for traveling and it does a fairly good job.  It isn&#x27;t as powerful as plug in models but it is lightweight and portable.  I think it is much better than not using one when away from home.</li>
    <li> This product is much better than I expected..is perfect size for travel..easy to operate and control, very compact.  Takes 2 filling of water for a full mouth..but fast, east to refill.  I highly recomend it.  Jacki    Redondo Beach, CA</li>
    <li> i bought this for travel only. it worked great for 10 day trip. i&#x27;m still using it at home to see how long batteries last. still working after 20 days. product was easy to use. need to refill water for complete rinse, but that was easy.</li>
    <li> I love the easy set up, and use of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drop in 2 batteries, and fill the tank, connect the nozzle and your good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read some other reviews that indicated low water pressure, but this seems more than adequate to me.  Very strong.  So much so, that if you hold the stream too close to your gums or tongue, it hurts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down side is that there is a LOT of splatter from the strong spray.  This could probably be minimized by a better technique, but water does go flying on the mirror, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact the splatter is so much on my mirror, that I&#x27;m considering using this in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is simply a well designed and reasonably priced product.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Unit arrived in excellent condition &amp; functions as advertised, however, will upgrade in the future to a unit that develops higher stream pressure.</li>
    <li> Perfect travel companion, lightweight and has good cleaning power. Highly recommended for use.[[ASIN:B0000A10MZ Panasonic EW1270AC Portable Oral Irrigator]]</li>
    <li> I got this on sale last week with a rebate.  Otherwise, I might have felt as if I overpaid for it.  So far it is working just fine (getting the job done) and I like the convenience of being able to have it lay flat on the bathroom counter without it taking up much space.  I figured we need the Sonicare and this because DS is getting braces next week.  I am giving it three stars because it does not seem very study and like so many other flimsy plastic products, planned obsolescence is the name of the game.  It did come with a one-year warranty:)</li>
    <li> Not only is this product very well conceived/designed, compact &amp; sturdy, but it works perfectly &amp; can be taken anywhere because it runs on batteries. Bravo Panasonic!</li>
    <li> First oral irrigator.  Aghast at how many food particles are left after brushing.  The Panasonic is easy and consistent.</li>
    <li> This works great!  I use it everyday and it is small enough to put in my handbag to use on the go.  The battery lasts a long time too.</li>
    <li> I tried disposable batteries then later tried rechargeable batteries but it drains batteries fast.  Would be great if it has its own lithium ion battery.  After several months it ended up in a box in the basement.</li>
    <li> I had the older model for at least four years, this model is more improved, it&#x27;s excellant for cleaning the area between the teeth and gums!</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace a bigger oral irrigator that had to be plugged in.  This is alot easier to use and clean.  The only thing, I usually have to fill it twice when using.  Would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this device after lunch and when travelling for two years, and it is still working.  This device is not as strong as an electric one that you might use at home, but for situations like travelling or work this is a great device for continuing your dental hygiene.  This was one purchase that was worth the cost of the device.</li>
    <li> Being battery operated, it is not as powerful as an electric oral irrigator, but its compact size makes it easy to pack for travel.  Good for its purpose.</li>
    <li> What a let down. The reviews were pretty good on this product but the performance is really lacking. I had a waterpik years ago and it had variable speeds and plenty of pressure if you wanted it. This item has one light duty pressure/speed and has a tough time getting anything out of your teeth.  The product does not hold very much water on a fill up and you have no idea which way the pik is aiming and it is very hard and wet to change directions.  I&#x27;m going back to the old plug in Waterpik, this Panasonic product just does not cut it.</li>
    <li> so i wanted to get one of those portable picker, and my dentist said i should get the waterpik . but after reading lots of reviews i decided to get the Panasonic. sine i never used the other one i can only write my experience with his one.  the picker works grate. it does the job very good, and i can see all the food that left in between my teeth going down the drain every time i use it. i just wish it would had more power. overall i am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I formerly had the Waterpik WP-360W which stopped working after the first day on vacation.  I then bought the Panasonic EW1270 as a replacement based on the reviews I saw here.  After finally having the chance use it, I can say it worked like a champ during my two week vacation.  It takes a couple of tank fills for each use, but even so, after two weeks the lithium batteries were still good.  The stream is strong, and although not adjustable, I would still very highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My dentist told me to start using an oral irrigator.  I didn&#x27;t want a large unit taking up space on the bathroom counter or spending a lot of money on it.  After researching products, this one looked good and I have not been disappointed.  It gets the job done; is reasonably priced; and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space.</li>
    <li> makes a mess when you use it but it makes my mouth feel clean.  i like to add some mouth wash in.</li>
    <li> I did have this for a while but gets stuff growing in it and very hard to clean. I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Excellent product easy to use, better than the corded versions that dentists recommend.  Well worth the price.  Quality of product is great.</li>
    <li> After using the Panasonic Oral Irrigator for 6 months, my dental check-up was great. Periodontal pockets that were detected on earlier exams were smaller. My dentist wondered what my regimen was.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is good for your heart also as the size of these pockets has been found to be correlated with heart disease ([...] So this small electric oral irrigator is good for your heart also!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The oral irrigator is very fast and easy to use. It takes seconds to fill and minutes to use. That is important for those things you are \\&quot;supposed to do daily\\&quot; but never seem to have the time to do.  The oral irrigator takes up very little counter space and is not a mess if you bump into it (like the larger irrigators with open reservoirs).  The pressure is very good and apparently my gums are impressed!!  And so is my Dentist!</li>
    <li> We recently purchased this item from Amazon.Com.  It is everything we expected!!  Panasonic makes a terrific product.</li>
    <li> I love the size and the design.  It works very well.  The directions say not to use with mouthwash.  Many of the reviews recommended rechargeable batteries, so that&#x27;s what I started with.</li>
    <li> Althouhg this is not a substitute for Flossing, but is quite effective in cleaning in-between the teeth. &lt;br /&gt;Althouhg some people have commented about low battery life and need to refill the same several times during a single use, I am qwite satisfied with both these parameters. &lt;br /&gt;Good Buy</li>
    <li> I tried another brand and was very disappointed, but the Panasonic is great.  It is very portable, but I just wanted something small for my bathroom shelf. It is easy to use and I like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have to be plugged into the wall outlet. It has great battery life, and is still going on the same batteries after 3 weeks. I also recommend rechargeable batteries.</li>
    <li> The original review below was written in mid May 2006.  Approx. June 5, several weeks after I expected a reply, I received a reply to my snail mail inquiry to Panasonic. The reply informed me how to return device. Tried Irrigator one more time before shipping it back to Panasonic, and the device worked. A plastic piece has dropped out of the resevoir, so I don&#x27;t know how long the Irrigator will now work, but I am going to give it a try. When the Irrigator works, it is good value for the money, and seems to be effective.    Written in Mid May 2006     While of good design, don&#x27;t buy this product unless you can afford to discard the Irrigator if it breaks. I have wasted hours of my time trying to deal with Panasonic Customer service, far more time than is justified by a $35 device. The Oral Irrigator failed within 30 days of use, but I didn&#x27;t get around to dealing with it until after the Amazon 30 day return period.    The Panasonic website doesn&#x27;t work, email to an address from the website is returned undelivered, phoning customer service means in indefinate hold, and if you finally do get someone, they are useless, and you may be summarily disconnected. Mail sent via USPS to Panasonic personal care division is not answered.  Phoning Panasonic&#x27;s corporate offices in New Jersey is a worthless exercise.     I have tried all of the above multiple times. And finally when Panasonic sends you an email, after multiple phone calls and prolongued discussion with Panasonic in New Jersey, the website to which you are referred by the email doesn&#x27;t work.     I have owned many Panasonic products, as they have been a preferred manufacturer for me. That has now changed.    I suggest to Amazon that, if my experience is repeated more than once with other customers, Amazon consider not carrying any Panasonic Personal Care Products.</li>
    <li> We bought this along with the plug in variety when my wife recently got braces on her teeth.  Without this handy item, she would have a tough time keeping her braces clean when we are not at home (she is meticulous about these things!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is surprisingly powerful, and delivers a strong stream of water that gets out the most stubborn food hiding and clinging to braces and teeth.  The resevoir is not huge, but enough to do the job considering this is a device for the &#x27;field&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The batteries are easily inserted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be nice is a small travel case was provided to protect the cleaner (that is my only grouse).</li>
    <li> I have had the Panasonic for about 2 months now and it is great.  It is much more gentle on my gums then flossing.  I have tight teeth in spots and it takes a lot of pressure to get floss between them.  Sometimes the floss really pops in and hurts my gums.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This irrigator works almost as well between teeth as floss but  cleans out the gums in front and behind the teeth better then floss. It leaves my mouth feeling very refreshed.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I plugged up the drain and watched what came out after a few meals and let&#x27;s just say it does it&#x27;s job well. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Battery life has been very good - better than I expected.  You do have to refill once or twice but it is quick and easy and not an issue.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I will be buying another for my wife.</li>
    <li> The Panasonic Oral Irrigator performs better and is easier to use than the Water Pik. The problem is that the rubber gasket in the water chamber &lt;br /&gt;shredded after about a month and a half and now leaks when it is full. I may have to replace it soon.</li>
    <li> this is very tiny and actually good enough for me to broght to europe for travel. it isn&#x27;t strong as waterpik I always using at home because it  works by batteries  but I traveled through europe problem-free with different european electric outlets  I satisfied with the product.&lt;br /&gt;it was compact to keep in my bag for lunch during the trip.</li>
    <li> Works well, and its disposable batteries are a big plus.  Tank is of adequate size.  Nicely built and has held up well in extensive travel.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. It runs out of water quickly, but it is easy to refill. I use rechargeable batteries because it would cost too much money to use regular AA batteries. It works fine with NiMH batteries.</li>
    <li> This is one powerful little tool &amp; it runs quiet also. I use rechargeable batteries with mine &amp; they last a long time. I have to fill my Panasonic twice to get the job done, but it is so easy to fill &amp; operate. Water Pik is a joke, this is the Real Deal! &lt;br /&gt;Steve</li>
    <li> This Portable Irrigator does exactly what I wanted it to do.  It is a very convenient substitute for cleaning my teeth and gums while I&#x27;m away from home.  When home I use my full-size unit.  The Panasonic Irrigator does a great job for such a small unit.  I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> The portable panasonic irrigator is a great tool for people who want more convienence when they irrigate.  I like that it is easy to fill &amp; provides easy portability.  The stream, although not as strong as a corded model, is very effective in cleaning between the teeth.  I always thought that the corded models were too strong and that this irrigator has just the right amount of pressure.</li>
    <li> This product was purchased for use on trips where it was not possible to take my Water Pik irrigator.    Although used for just one week thus far, I was pleased with the pressure offered by the product and it&#x27;s ease of use. Additionally, the use of batteries, which are easily found in most any store, is a big plus in the product&#x27;s appeal.</li>
    <li> The Portable Irrigator is very convenient for having at the office or taking on trips.  It is simple to operate and works well.  The ONLY negative I have is that the water pressure is not as strong as it could be.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Panasonic unit to take on an upcoming trip - versus lugging the large water pik I use in my bathroom.  I have only used it a few times but it appears it will certainly do the job.  Filling with water is an extra step but due to it&#x27;s compactness and light weight it certainly \\&quot;outweighs\\&quot; taking the large version.  Yes, so far I like it for a trip or maybe staying overnight at a friends house.  I would recommend it.    George Morrison</li>
    <li> Outstanding product. I bought it for my wife who has only used manual toothbrushes in the past and finally decided to \\&quot;take the plunge.\\&quot; It is so great, that I plan to purchase one for me (to replace my older Braun 2-speed Oral B). The Phillips has a built-in UV Sanitizer (I don&#x27;t know how well it works, but use it anyway), is higher pitched sound (which, I am told by my dentist, is patented at the best sonic pitch). I can also take the additional portable re-charger on long trips. The Braun has such a large re-charger that, except for short trips which don&#x27;t require re-charging, is impractical to take. Subjectively, I believe that the overall quality is better than the Braun. My dentist recommends it (but he also sells it at a profit, so I can&#x27;t assume his \\&quot;objectivity\\&quot;). I give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> It goes along in the RV, travel, and home use.  It is stimulating for the gums.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Works wonderfully.  Just enough water to do your whole  mouth.  Terrific size, takes up hardly any space.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my third one of these and really like them.  They work well and seem well designed.  The water tank is a bit small, so you will end up filling the unit multiple times (I generally need 2-3) per use.  I bought this to use on trips, but have been using it also at home because I find it takes little space on the back of the sink and does the job well.  Using daily, I&#x27;ve been getting about a year out of these units.</li>
    <li> This powerful little irrigator really gets the job done at a great price--and, although others may have complained about battery life--I&#x27;m three weeks in on the same original (non-rechargable) batteries.  Because of the portable size, it&#x27;s necessary to fill the water reservoir a couple of times in order to get to all those teeth, but I can really see the difference it&#x27;s made with my gums--and it&#x27;s nice to be able to throw it in my travel bag.</li>
    <li> Works okay but needs a refill to complete the job. Needs a speed control.  It is bulky to handle and difficult to turn off while manipulating.  Would not buy another one.</li>
    <li> This is a good unit for stay-overs or vacations. The only problem I had was that the water feed tube came off inside the top section. This was easy to fix. I just pushed it back on the nipple. I never had a problem with it again. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> This is the handiest little irrigator around.  It does a good enough job and is compact and light weight.  Easy to fold up and take along on a trip.  I&#x27;ve considered getting a second one to keep in my suitcase.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0000AERJR Panasonic EW1270AC Portable Oral Irrigator]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have had a few others in the past, but they were too weak to think about taking on a second trip.  My wife, who uses a Waterpik electric unit at home at least once a day, just returned from a 4-week trip abroad, and she reported that: (1) this worked great--strong stream, and (2) she did not have to change the battery at all during the entire trip, even with daily use.  Five stars to Panasonic on this model.  I am leaving in a few days for a short trip, and I will certainly take mine along (I had ordered one for each of us).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ADDED COMMENT: Wednesday; August 5, 2009--Be careful with the irrigator tip and an open drain.  I lost my tip down the bathroom drain in the Sydney, Australia Hilton (happily, on the last day of my stay).  It is encouraging to note that one can obtain replacement tips from J&amp;R through the Amazon Marketplace.  That way, you do not have to order a whole new unit.</li>
    <li> I paid $27.95 (free shipping) in Oct 2009 for this item and it still works as it did when I first got it. Very portable with just batteries, no cords or chargers. Recommended to me by my dental hygienist. Easy to use, empty out, and rinse the reservoir.</li>
    <li> I hardly ever use it but my wife seems to like it. Blasts the crud loose (talking about my own mouth, don&#x27;t know about hers.) OK, the 20-word requirement is done, Submit. Or, quit before the hole gets deeper.</li>
    <li> I am still using this after several years.  I like that it is so portable and easily cleaned.  I like the portability.</li>
    <li> This is a great oral irrigator. It doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space, runs a long time on batteries, is portable and does as good a job as the plug in type. Mine is still running after several years.</li>
    <li> The portable irrigator is difficult to use. Water sprays all over - outside your mouth. You have to refill it with water several times during one cleaning. And it doesn&#x27;t effectively clean the food in your mouth. At times, it irritates your gums. Save your money and wait for a better product!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had a chance to use this a few times.  It&#x27;s a little messy (as all of them are).  It&#x27;s very handy and portable. It doesn&#x27;t take up much room and it&#x27;s easy to use.  I like it so far.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s quiet a good. when I have a trip, it&#x27;s very convenient. everything is enough for need. one thing, if I have to point out, sometimes, I feel the water pressure is so strong.</li>
    <li> This little gadget got my teeth and gums cleaner than I ever thought possible. There was just one drawback--it was making my gums recede! Used it for 2 weeks, 2 or 3 times a day or more (the fresh clean feeling got quite addictive). I actually felt better. I had gingivitus and slight periodontitis. But soon my teeth were getting quite sensitive and to my horror I realized it was indeed destoying my gums. It says in the instructions to talk to your dentist first before using if you have gum desease which I have not, perhaps he will know if its possible to use safely. It also says to not touch the tip directly to your gums, indeed, as far away as possible but this is difficult since then its harder to keep the mouth completely shut &amp; water sprays out. And you can&#x27;t see what you&#x27;re doing either since your mouth is closed. Anyway since using I have learned how important it is to keep ones mouth clean--plaque forms at the tooth gum boundary 20 minutes after eating &amp; the bacteria double every hour and enter into your bloodstream through the gums and cause all kinds of problems.</li>
    <li> Yes, this thing has power. Not as much as a plug-in WaterPik, but unless you also use your Oral Irrigators for hydro strip mining gold, the Panasonic will do just fine. I accidentally turned it on once and the water stream shot clear across the room! Doubles as a high-powered squirt gun in a pinch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How long does it take to get a bulky WaterPik plugged in, assembled, filled with water, used, cleaned, disassembled and stored away again? The Panasonic takes only 10-seconds from storage to working. Refills due to the small water reservoir? Less than 5-seconds, making multiple refills a non-issue really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s face it, the more time, mess and hassle we know a task will take, the less likely we are to do it. That&#x27;s just human nature in the busy world we live.  Fortunately the Panasonic rids you of these subconscious roadblocks in this QUIET, compact and convenient machine. Use it for travel or bring it to work for after lunch clean-ups. I doubt the WaterPik can make the same claim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, you&#x27;ll need to recharge your 2 AA batteries often, but if you don&#x27;t already own rechargeable batteries/recharger, then the Panasonic is a great reason to start! They get 1000 recharges per battery compared to buying hundreds of expensive alkaline batteries... you do the math!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: If you&#x27;re a person who never flosses and isn&#x27;t convinced their water irrigator is effective unless it&#x27;s loud and leaves all their gums bleeding, choose a WaterPik. But judging from their reviews their quality and longevity have been suspect at best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I have no stock in Panasonic nor do I work for them. I just really like well made, quality products that make my busy life a little simpler.  :)</li>
    <li> Had owned previous model, EW176WC, which performed well but collected mold from time to time.  Left it somewhere while traveling, so ordered two of the new ones (EW1270AC).  Much improved, runs longer on a tank, but  water stream is slightly thinner.  Better materials, better design.  No mold.    Received intact on or about 1 July 2006.  Opened one upon receipt, saved other for future use while traveling or at work.  Opened second one yesterday, 9 August 2006.  Nozzle was missing.  Called Panasonic today.  Got the runaround.  We can&#x27;t do that, call this number.  They can do it.  After several phone calls (seven with people) they finally said they would not send the part!  They insisted I contact the seller.  So now I have contacted Amazon.  I told them I don&#x27;t want to return the item; I just want the nozzle.  (Have not heard back yet.)               How much does it cost, you ask.  Five bucks.  Fine. If I need to, I will order the part.  But you can believe without doubt I will not buy a Panasonic product for the rest of my life.                        P.S.:  Had a similar experience with a Panasonic fax machine about two years ago; thought I had learned my lesson then.  (I went through 4 or 5 of them before the warranty ran out.)  But how hard is it to screw up such a simple product as an oral irrigator?  See the review by Charles Hine, dated 16 May 2006, below.    11 August 2006:  Wow, Amazon is sending me a new irrigator along with a prepaid return label for the incomplete one.  Did I say I would never buy a Panasonic product?  Well, I take that back.  I might buy some more irrigators -- but only from Amazon.  (I have no affiliation with Amazon.)    14 August 2006:  Received replacement irrigator from Amazon, complete with nozzle.  They sent me an email explaining that their only possible recourse was to send the complete item.  Works for me.</li>
    <li> We use a Water Pik oral irrigator for everyday dental hygene and it performs well except for its size making it a strictly home limited operation. So we purchased a Panasonic EW1270AC Portable Oral Irrigator for use when we travel. It was a wise choice and we recommend it to everyone. Works well, is compact and makes dental hygene easy when your \\&quot;on the road\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> We have had many Panasonic products over the years and have always been pleased with their performance.  This one falls way short.  It works pretty well with fresh batteries for the first 3-4 cleanings, but the power diminishes greatly thereafter.  Taken on a trip of several days I must carry a supply of batteries to keep it going with any effectiveness. I would like to return it if it isn&#x27;t too late.</li>
    <li> This is a must have for anyone with braces.  Small food particles can easily get trapped around braces and this product is a life saver!   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;No matter how well you think you brushed your teeth - you will be amazed at the results of Panasonic&#x27;s Oral Irrigator.  In fact, you will be  wondering if you really did brush your teeth.  Because flossing is so time intensive and fiddling with braces, most people don&#x27;t do it. The irrigator is the best alternative to keeping your teeth clean and food free.  Both my orthodontist and dentist have raved at how clean my teeth are.    &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Once you use it you won&#x27;t want to be without it. If you have braces, it&#x27;s a given you will have food showing every time you eat.  In 30 seconds the irrigator takes care of those annoying sesame seeds you can&#x27;t reach and the spinach salad that wrapped itself around the wires.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So do yourself a favor and have one of these irrigators at home and take a second one to school or work.  It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> It works great, at home or on the road. Cleans well, no need for floss. It is better than floss because you don&#x27;t dig into your gums.</li>
    <li> I ordered this gadget from Amazon on a whim.  I am sure glad I did.  This little thing works great!  You may have to refill the basin once during use, but it&#x27;s no bug deal &#x27;cause you are standing at the basin anyway.  Rechargable batteries are the way to go, can get lots of use from one charge.  Get it, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> I have had this product for a couple of months now.  I have also used the Waterpik \\&quot;tank system\\&quot; in the past.  The advantage of the Panasonic is simply convenience.  It takes up very little space and is easy and fairly quick to use.  The batteries have held up well.      My only negatives would be:    1.  The pulse power, which needs to be cranked up slightly. It still does the job, but about 25% more power would give it that \\&quot;wow, it&#x27;s really cleaning like crazy\\&quot; factor, which I don&#x27;t really get with this, but I did get with the larger Waterpik.      2.  The spout at the end easily swivels around the base, so you have to maneuver it carefully and make sure it is pointed in the right direction at all times, which can be somewhat annoying.      I do use this device more than I used the larger tank system from Waterpik, so in that regard I recommend it.  Having something with somewhat less power that I use regularly is clearly a better value than a more powerful unit that I use rarely.      On the other hand, if you don&#x27;t mind the clutter on your bathroom counter and will use it just as often, I would go with the larger Waterpik system with the tank and tubes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a strong advocate for oral irrigators.  My at-home Waterpik irrigator saved my gums.  I looked at reviews for portable products and decided on the Panasonic.  It&#x27;s light and easy to use.  My only complaint is that, unlike the non-portable machines, the speed is not adjustable.  I would like to have the option to make the water pulse more strongly.  Also, you need to fill it at least twice to get the job done; however, it&#x27;s easy to do and therefore not a problem.  So far, I&#x27;m very happy I bought it.</li>
    <li> Before you get the wrong idea from my review, let me state my opinion: \\&quot;I love this product!!!\\&quot;  I will not repeat what I&#x27;ve read in other reviews. Instead I want to give you an idea of the durability of this product. Here goes. After a while of using, I noticed that batteries were coming out damp, about 10 months after using daily. I change them about every two weeks, using NiMH rechargeables. I thought I was just being clumsy while changing the batteries and making them wet. But I methodically dried it up before opening the battery compartment. It never occured to me that there was water leaking or water infiltration into the unit. Now after 15 months it finally died. It no longer turns pump on. Being out of warranty I opened it. I found the pump motor had rusty water all around it.   So what did I do about it? I bought several more as replacements. It gets used at least once a day (sometimes 2 or 3), to keep braces clean. It sure helps protect the orthodontic expense we are going through. We cannot find another product that is as portable (small size) and practical (no power cords or coiled hose to deal with) to store on the bathroom counter. It is also super compact for taking on trips (it survived going to Europe and Mexico).  I&#x27;m a first time user and I was skeptic about its value. If you find it at 30% off retail, then consider yourself lucky and get yourself one!</li>
    <li> I have owned one of these before and they really really lack power.  Better to just floss, or rinse.  save your cash and buy 10,000 feet of floss instead.</li>
    <li> The packaging of this product was so difficult that I severely cut  my wrist trying to cut into the bubble protector.  I was trying to  open it with an exacto knife and it slipped.  It cut over 1/2 inch  and very deep and I am on a blood thinner, so it was very scary.  Please try to do another type of wrap.    The product itself is wonderful.    Mrs. A. Darling</li>
    <li> Pros: quite portable when in closed position, good water pressure, comfortable jet nozzle, fast pulsations, easy to grip, not too noisy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: only 40 seconds or less of water per tankful, granted, this is a portable device, but not enough for a full mouth cleaning (will have to refill 1 or 2 times); battery life is mediocre (manual says 20 minutes, but I find that pressure diminishes after 15 minutes of run time); cannot use any fluoride rinse liquids with this - only water is allowed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To correct some other review regarding the run time - the 20 minutes it reports is for battery life, not water capacity. Water capacity is 165mL (approx. 40 seconds worth with new batteries) as per the manual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t come close to the larger counter-top devices in practicality, but for something to throw in a suitcase, it fits the bill.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t help but laugh hysterically everytime I try to use this with my 10 year old.  First of all, you MUST be directly over the sink when planning on using this irrigator.  Second, plan on gagging over the amount of water that is shot into your mouth.  Third, you WILL be wiping down your entire bathroom after the shower that takes place from the water splattering out of your mouth.  WOW!!  Now the good news is that it does in fact work.  We bought this for our 10 year old that needed something to help clear out his orthodontic equipement and it has helped.  But WHOA it is a mess!  Beware...</li>
    <li> The power from the nozzle and the amount of water the device can hold is more than adequate to clean your teeth. I never bought a portable Water Pik so I can&#x27;t make any comparisons. The only thing to add about the purchase was how Amazon dealt with an abnormally slow free shipping of this. They sent it out next day air!</li>
    <li> This Irrigator performs fairly well, but not great. I bought it as a replacement for my WaterPik that unfortunately died after one year of use. The WaterPik was cordless with a rechargeable battery and it was somewhat more powerful. You could not, however, travel with it unless you brought along its base unit. This unit (Panasonic) uses disposable batteries that require replacement each month if used daily. It is, however, therefore better for travel than the WaterPik. I think while the Panasonic is not quite as powerful it probably does an adequate job of cleaning the gum pockets; which my dentist says is the real benefit of using an Irrigator. I use it everyday after brushing and my dentist says he sees an improvement in my dental hygiene and, more specifically, health of gums.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the water pyc.  It has a lot of power and cleans really well .  I recommend it highly</li>
    <li> I was convinced to purchase this item because of the good reviews Ive read about it. The first 2 weeks worked perfectly well but I was so disappointed that on the 3rd week it suddenly stopped working even on new batteries. I&#x27;m returning it and will probably get the Waterpik.</li>
    <li> I bought my first Panasonic oral irrigator over 5 years ago.  It and a replacement I bought served well, but over time were prone to water leakage into the battery compartment.  This new model seems to have solved that problem as well as being easier to keep clean and providing a large enough tank capacity to require only one filling per use.  It&#x27;s a winner in my book.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I knew if I had the larger oral irrigator I would put it away and forget to use it, this one is small enough to leave out and that way you see it so you don&#x27;t forget to use it. You do have to refill it alot but it does work ok . And you can bring it to travel.</li>
    <li> Very convenient when not at home.  My 8 yr old uses to get stuck food out from palate expander while at school; does the job well.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this irrigator for a few weeks but a few days ago it became useless. It goes into a pulsing action and the pressure pushes the tip out - it won&#x27;t stay in. I thought it might be the batteries and replaced them but no difference. Since I bought it in the States but am in Paris France for several months to come it&#x27;s not worth sending back so I&#x27;ll have to throw it away. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is much better than the first Panasonic battery operated Irrigator. The old one was good but I&#x27;m glad I got this one.  I use rechargable batteries which work better than regular batteries. It runs out of water pretty quick but thats a small inconvience because it fills quickly and easily.</li>
    <li> My old Panasonic irrigator gave out after 5 years of travel-only use. It occasionally wouldn&#x27;t switch on, finally wouldn&#x27;t switch on at all. Batteries were good. I scraped the (-) contact in the battery compartment cap and the (+) contact at the bottom of the battery compartment with a straightened-out wire coat hanger and it worked again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These contacts do corrode. If you&#x27;re not going to use the device for a while, take the batteries out and leave the battery compartment cap off to let the contacts dry thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that the Panny doesn&#x27;t supply as much pressure as my Water Pik but it&#x27;s much better for travel.</li>
    <li> I got this awhile back for travel and it works pretty well.  Not as good as my [[ASIN:B000GLRREU Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser]], but it does the job.  Batteries seem to last an ok amount of time.  But this just doesn&#x27;t have the force or power of my regular model.  But for travel, or maybe even at the office, this one does the trick.  I do, however, have to fill it twice to clean my mouth as thoroughly as I like.  If you&#x27;re looking for one to use in the home, this one isn&#x27;t it; it&#x27;ll prolly cost too much in batteries and isn&#x27;t as good as the regular waterpik. But overall, it&#x27;s good for what it is; a travel oral irrigator.</li>
