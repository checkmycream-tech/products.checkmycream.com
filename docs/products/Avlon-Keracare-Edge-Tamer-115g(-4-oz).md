      <li>its worth the money :)</li>

      <li>well worth the price</li>
      <li>This product is great especially if you have kinky, natural hair like mine.</li>

      <li>Great product, second time ordered from the same seller.</li>
      <li>Thank you very much.</li>
      <li>There still was some white flaking, but I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s with any product.</li>
      <li>This was my first time purchasing this product</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty gummy tho and will probably build up but just wash hair more often,  overall</li>
      <li>Love this product - especially the size!</li>
      <li>I am african american as well and do not have any time of good hair</li>
      <li>Ok this is the deal this product is good as long as you only use a TINY bit.</li>
      <li>So, I guess that&#x27;s positive.  </li>
      <li>I buy it quite often and the shipping is pretty fast.</li>
      <li>It does lay your edges down, but the look of your hair is nothing spectacular.  </li>
      <li>Then realized its super clear.</li>
      <li>I am happy to report that this products holds the edges of my hair down for several hours.  </li>
      <li>This product is only really good for a single use.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I LOVEEEE THIS EDGE TAMER!!!!! I have tried other products and this really works and lives up to the name!</li>
    <li> I just received this product and I have used it just once but the result was nice. I have curly hair that I sometimes relax.  I haven&#x27;t relaxed my hair in sometime so my edges are not straight; when I applied the product, it worked really well to flatten my hair. I didn&#x27;t need a lot of the product either and so far it does not look flaky. I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> I tried this product after my sister received it from her hair dresser and told me how great it worked for her. Its not sold in stores so I bought it online. It works wonders for keeping my edges down. I am African-American and I have really curly hair that is hard to tame. This product held my edges down and does not flake. What I like most about this product is that you dont have to use a lot of it for it to work and when you brush your hair the next day there is little need to apply more of the product because it sits in your hair and starts to work all over again after brushing your hair. This is the best product I have used since the KMS wax stick which is no longer sold. Great product for people with curly hair.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best edge control Ive used.  I am African American and have 4b hair and it is really difficult to get my hair to lay flat. This is the only thing that works for my hair type. I just have to make sure I use it on clean hair to not get that white film on your hair.</li>
    <li> She really like this product. Mainly because of previous experience &amp; usage.</li>
    <li> This works great for my edges.  I find that it works best when i mix it with a little water, as it is a little thick.  I have no issues with buildup at all. I find that I do need to apply it everyday, but it generally lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Really holds it all down. It&#x27;s pretty gummy tho and will probably build up but just wash hair more often,  overall I&#x27;m impressed !</li>
    <li> True this item will make your edges lay down and doesn&#x27;t flake but beware it does turn white if you have to reapply it within a few days without washing your hair in between. I didn&#x27;t like that fact because it cakes up on top of each other and my edges would be bulky and white by end of the day. I am african american as well and do not have any time of good hair so I bought this product to tame my edges while wearing a sewin. I now have bought the olive oil edge tamer which is much cheaper and will see how that works out for me</li>
    <li> Just use a little bit of the product on your edges. It works really well on my hair ..... ...</li>
    <li> Excellent product and I would gladly re-order from this vendor.</li>
    <li> not what I thought, however Avlon is really a good product.</li>
    <li> Perfect for fixing rough edges</li>
    <li> when I first opened it I thought it was empty. Then realized its super clear. I haven&#x27;t used it yet but the smell is faint which is good.</li>
    <li> I have used this product several times now and feel that it is just overpriced for the results that you get.  It does lay your edges down, but the look of your hair is nothing spectacular.  I do have to reapply it the next day, but there is no flaking.  So, I guess that&#x27;s positive.  I think what makes it different from styling gel is that it doesn&#x27;t harden your hair.  I would like it much better if were sold for $5.00 instead of $17.00.</li>
    <li> i absolutely love this gel, it&#x27;s healthy, doesn&#x27;t flake, the best edge tammer your ever gonna find, I know, I&#x27;ve tried over ever possible brand.  Best thing, online is almost 10.00 cheaper than in stores, at least in MN</li>
    <li> It is NOT flake free, and only really works if your edges are already straight.  If you&#x27;re in between hair appointments and need to tame your edges for a neat, straight look... doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> My beautician introduced me to this product and when I tried to purchase more she was out of it. I didn&#x27;t ask but should have asked if it can purchased from someone other a salon, which I found out after I purchased the two jars that they can be purchased from a beauty supply store. My next purchase will be directly from the local beauty supply store to avoid the shipping and handling. This product works very very well for holding down the edges.</li>
    <li> As a black woman who is recently going natural this really helps keep edges down and neat. Wonderful product. Better than JAM!</li>
    <li> My hairdresser uses this on my edges and it works wonders! I use it in the off weeks I don&#x27;t go to the hairdresser.</li>
    <li> It says that this product should only be applied to clean hair so caking up should not even be a problem. You should wash your hair and not be lazy. Also that olive oil product is a joke. It&#x27;s like jam. It get all nasty and greasy to the point that its literally sliding down your face on a hot day. Wash your hair and you&#x27;ll be fine. I&#x27;ve also heard that this product makes your edges grow like a weed!</li>
    <li> Love this tamer. Works great!</li>
    <li> Really works good. Been natural for 3 years and it slicks my hair down. I highly recommend this product to those who enjoy slick edges.</li>
    <li> This product cost me 20 dollars! Sadly it does not work for my hair type! I thought because it cost so much that it would be an excellent product; but no, it is not. I am African American who is currently transitioning from relaxed to natural. The jar says that it holds down natural &amp; permed edges but not mine!! It holds down for about 15 minutes then curls and gets greasy! Im very dissapointed that i purchased this products. I&#x27;ve also realized that if you use to much it turns white, so i have to run the side of a flat iron against my eges! Which is not healthy for everyday use. After the jar is gone i will not be purchasing this product nor refer this product!</li>
    <li> Keeps my edges down while still feeling moisturized and not dry! I&#x27;m almost out it and will order this again!</li>
    <li> This product is the best edge tamer. It leaves no marks. It will last me a llong time because you only need a small amount daily.</li>
    <li> Gift to my sister &amp; she liked it very much.</li>
    <li> The. Best. Edge. Control. EVER!  Doesn&#x27;t turn hair white. Sleek, shiny hold. The best thing I&#x27;ve ever purchased from Amazon ever.</li>
    <li> This edge tamer did not slick my edges down at all really. It lasted for a short amount of time. It began flaking up &amp; it turned white. I was horrified going into a meeting at work!!! Needless to say, I will not purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I heard of another product &amp; used it for my edges &amp; it worked wonders. It is Creme of Nature Argan Oil Perfect Edge. It held my edges for 5 days instead of 1 hour. It never flaked or turned white. It actually made my hair shiny &amp; quite smooth. I would not recommend Keracare Edge Tamer at all. But if you are looking for some edge control that works &amp; last for days I&#x27;d try Creme of Nature Argan Oil Perfect Edge. It works great for me</li>
    <li> I liked the product but wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. There still was some white flaking, but I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s with any product. The size of the container is worth the price. I&#x27;ll be using this for a long time.  In all the product was good and did what it needed to do. It looks good and shiny at first but appears to go away.</li>
    <li> Yes finally an edge control to tame my edges. I have unprocessed hair that is curly kinky. The products hold for a long time. Remember that a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while and it works as advertised. It lays my edges down without looking hard or flaky. Even my hair stylist uses this in her salon. I just started buying on Amazon for the price. It&#x27;s an excellent product!</li>
    <li> My hair dresser used it, and I fell in love with it. A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Doesnt hold on natural hair!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold my edges what so ever and it gets greasy after a while. If you have a lot of edges that needs to be laid then this is not the product for you.</li>
    <li> Love this product - especially the size!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m African American and when I apply this, my edges make me look like I&#x27;m mixed lol. My edges stay slicked all day and I love it. They give you a good amount per container but I wish they made bigger ones . Still love it though !</li>
    <li> My beautician uses this product , and I fell in love. It holds better than gel , and even holds through the summer heat and humidity. Great buy!</li>
    <li> This was my first time purchasing this product and I did not care for it.  I think I wasted my money.  It makes my hair too hard and I doubt that I will use the product.</li>
    <li> This product is great especially if you have kinky, natural hair like mine. This product was recommended to me by my hair dresser she always uses it. its worth the money :)</li>
    <li> Works real good keeps your edges down all day</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on the reviews. It did not work for me!! It slicked down my edges down for five minutes, then I got a white build-up. Overall, I was very disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my natural type 3 (or so) hair.  As a Black woman, I&#x27;m somewhat weary of purchasing products without great reviews.  This product was used by a stylist as she was two-strand twisting my hair, and I was amazed by the results.  I now use it to tame my edges, when I&#x27;m wearing almost any do.  It&#x27;s truly a miracle product!</li>
    <li> The best Gel I have ever used.</li>
    <li> The product works great for soft hair.  This is the only edge control that works for my hair.  The hair holds together the entire day without frizzy up or curling up.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of edge control products and so far this one is the Best.&lt;br /&gt;It gives your edges a very smooth finish with out the build up or stiffness!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE IT!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this edge control. Really holds it down.</li>
    <li> Edge Tamer works great and a little bit lasts a long time.  I bought it in March - it&#x27;s now 2 months later and I&#x27;ve used less than 1/4 of the jar. I am happy to report that this products holds the edges of my hair down for several hours.  I tried cheaper disappointing products in the past that worked for only 1 hour or less, leaving a lot of residue.  I gave Edge Tamer 4 stars (instead of 5) because there is some residue from the thick consistency but it&#x27;s manageable.  I recommend after applying the product, re-smooth any caked-on residue after 1/2 hour and it will be gone.  I plan to this buy this product again.</li>
    <li> It worked ok in the winter for keeping my edges tamed; however, since it has began to warm up a bit, but the end of the day my forehead is a sticky mess.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, it works wonders. No matter how badly my hair needs to be done. After using this stuff my edges become silky and smooth, like I was part Indian.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cake up. Lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I got a email saying that my transaction was canceled, so I had order the keracare product again. So the day that it&#x27;s supposed to be delivered I got the product that was denied and the product I reordered. So I was charged for somthing that I thought was canceled, but at least I got the products safely and on time. The product works good on dry hair and edges. My daughter has African American hair and it doesn&#x27;t work very well on her hair.  If you sweat or wet your hair it will wash right off. If you put to much  on your edges or hole head it will leave white stuff in your hair from the product.</li>
    <li> Ok this is the deal this product is good as long as you only use a TINY bit. This product is only really good for a single use. What I mean by single use is that after you use it you have to wash the area before you apply more or you will get a nasty buildup that isn&#x27;t in any form nice looking. I also have to say if you are an eyeglass wearer like myself be very careful not to get it on your glasses. it ruined the finish on my Prada plastic glasses. I am a little afraid if it does that to plastic what is it doing to my skin and hair. Now once again it does work but it has its limitations. Another reason for using a tiny amount is it gets greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone out there finds a product that holds down edges without buildup or a greasy residue please please please share it with me...</li>
    <li> I have ordered this product in the past. It was in great condition when delivered, as expected. Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> I have tried several different Edge Tamers and the hold was very week.  However, Avlon Keracare was awesome.  I have very coarse type 4c hair.  It is stubborn and unruly but this product worked very well for me.</li>
    <li> It held my edges down every bit of 30 mins than all my curls came back, I would say if your hair is processed it will be a nice sleek hold but with natural hair we have a lot of these waves going so we need a actual product that will hold the smooth look. I have better results with HIcks</li>
    <li> Simply the best for edges....very moisturizing and keep edges beautiful all day. My mom and I like trying different products and this one is a true winner!!</li>
    <li> Great product, second time ordered from the same seller.</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff!!! Works wonders on edges! Keeps edges soft, slick and moisturized. I buy it quite often and the shipping is pretty fast.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best edge tammer! It keeps your edges down all day!</li>
    <li> works well to keep little ends in check</li>
    <li> Love this product! It is one of the best edge tamers out there for my natural hair! I have bought this item several times and it never fails me! It doesnt cake and it never turns white. Love it!</li>
    <li> My sister introduced my to Avlon Keracare Edge Tamer a year ago.  Thanks Sis. As long as there is hair on my head and I can get a perm this will always be my chose for keeping my edges smooth and laying in place. I found it to be fantastic for my Afro-American hair.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT WORKS WELL ONLY ON SHORT HAIR THAT IS RELAXED ONLY.  IT CAN BUILD UP AND GET HEAVY/STICKY ON YOUR HAIRLINE AND THEN YOU ARE FORCED TO WASH YOUR HAIR.  BUT IT IS CLEAR.  NON STAINING.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff 3 days straight since I&#x27;ve purchased it and each time I would notice that my hair would lose hold in the middle of the day. Guess I need to find something else to get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;If it matters I have 4a/4b type hair.</li>
    <li> Works ok on natural hair. In sure it would hold much better on relaxed hair. Build up is not too much.</li>
    <li> I purchased based off reviews and thought I finally found something to slick down my edges and sadly this did not do it for me.  I have 4a type hair and while this product feels like it would give a firm hold it did not.  I put it on and it stayed straight for about 30 secs after that it curled right back up.  So this is a no for me, will keep looking...</li>
    <li> Every woman should have this product!  If you like creating sleek styles or the perfectly pulled back ponytail this is the product for you.  I have a lot of fly-aways that I often tried to fix with hairspray.  But this edge tamer works even better.  Put a little in the palm of your hand, rub your hands together, and then apply around the edges.  I then use a brush to work it into my hair.  You do not even need to use hairspray with it.  Your hair is smooth and in place without feeling hard or sticky.  Ideal between touch-ups as well!</li>
    <li> This is the a good pamade.  It is durable and lasts all day.  Quite expensive but well worth the price</li>
    <li> This product tames my edges and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair.  It works best when your hair is straight, but I use it on my natural hair too.</li>
    <li> Just okay!  It leaves a white residue in your hair.  My advice is to keep your hair clean each time you apply this stuff.  I personally prefer Design Essentials edge tamer as it holds the best without all of the yucky residue that this leaves behind!  Yucky!</li>
    <li> Really greasy. Even a small amount is too much.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s been a learning curve for me to figure out how much I should use for my 3a hair type. A little goes a long way for me. It&#x27;s got a pleasant smell that lingers throughout the day. Product buildup is not an issue either.</li>
    <li> Works great! Not greasy, but gives an excellent shine and finish. Holds the hair great!!!!</li>
    <li> This product did allow for a soft hold on my kinky curls but before the day was out I had white flakes. Not so great for the cost.</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  Makes your hair grow</li>
