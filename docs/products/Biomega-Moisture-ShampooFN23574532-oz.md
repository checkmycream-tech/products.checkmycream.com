<ol>
      <li>This is a wonderful solution!</li>
      <li>Wonderful scent!  </li>
      <li>Great for hair with Keratin treatments, color or glaze!</li>
      <li>It does not have an overly perfumey smell and it does an excellent job of cleansing hair without stripping all of the oils and without leaving a siliconey residue (get my drift Pantene?).</li>
      <li>This is unequivocally the best shampoo that I have ever used.</li>

      <li>Worth every dollar, this shampoo is healthy for hair.</li>

      <li>PRETTY MUCH IN LINE WITH RETAIL PRICING.  </li>
      <li>Combined with a good conditioner, makes it soft and less frizzy.</li>
      <li>This product really leaves my hair soft.  </li>
      <li>One-third of the product was missing from the container and it looked like someone had put shrink wrap over the top.  </li>

      <li>I received this product in the mail today and when I opened the package it was wet and full of shampoo.  </li>

<li> Recommended by my colorist, this cleans the hair well, doesn&#x27;t fade color, and doesn&#x27;t dry the hair.</li>
<li> I have extremely dry and frizzy hair</li>
<li> Purchased because it has no sulfates which will help prolong hair treatments listed previously.</li>
<li> It appears that it had been previously used.</li>
<li> Moisturizing, but not too heavy.  </li>
<li> Was not quite used to less suds, but I adjusted!</li>
<li> My hairdresser recommended it a few years ago because it doesn&#x27;t have all the bad stuff in it, but I won&#x27;t use anything else because of what it does for my hair.  </li>

    <li> I received this product in the mail today and when I opened the package it was wet and full of shampoo.  One-third of the product was missing from the container and it looked like someone had put shrink wrap over the top.  I would not advise buying this product online.

    <li> I have extremely dry and frizzy hair and I&#x27;ve tried lots of different types of shampoo.  This is the only type I will use anymore because it is the only one that I found that actually made a difference in my hair.  My hairdresser recommended it a few years ago because it doesn&#x27;t have all the bad stuff in it, but I won&#x27;t use anything else because of what it does for my hair.  Combined with a good conditioner, makes it soft and less frizzy.</li>
