      <li>This is simply the best cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>

      <li>But I&#x27;m happy with the results thus far on my skin staying hydrated.  </li>

      <li>If you are looking for a gentle, natural product with excellent cleansing ability, this is it.  </li>
      <li>This cleanser is nothing short of amazing and by far the best cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>It also has a uniquely yummy scent.  </li>
      <li>makes my face feel clean after a day of makeup.</li>
      <li>It smells great, and my face feels so smooth after each use - gentle enough to use twice a day.</li>
      <li>I think this is a good natural product by an ethical company.</li>
      <li>This is a good cleanser for my dry skin.</li>
      <li>It goes a great job - cleans really well, but doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
      <li>starters, this--for lack of a better term--smells like old lady perfume; it&#x27;s cloying and stays on your skin all day, so</li>
      <li>No artificial frangrance,</li>
      <li>since it is a product I use twice a day on my skin, I am trying to be more conscious of what I am using.  </li>
      <li>I have been looking for a more natural cleanser,</li>
      <li>/&gt;Product arrived quickly and was exactly as advertised.</li>
      <li>also, my pores got very large.  </li>
      <li>I have been on the lookout for cleansers that are more natural and this really fits the bill.  </li>
      <li>Very gentle for mature/dry skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>No chemicals, but a powerful scent that would certainly annoy if you don&#x27;t like it.</li>
      <li>I will ever try another MyChelle product (especially without being able to smell it first).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so dissatisfied with this, my first experience, that I&#x27;m not sureif</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products and MyChelle consistently pulls through.  </li>
      <li>I purchase most of my facial products from Vitacost, but I did want to leave a review on Amazon because I often refer to customer opinions from here.  </li>
      <li>At first the smell bothered me because you expect a pumpkin smell</li>
      <li>Really gives your skin that added moisture and softness in a face wash, which is rare.</li>
      <li>My skin feels invigorated and moisterized after use.will definitely buy and check out more products.</li>
      <li>It has a light pumpkin scent and a creamy texture that leaves your skin feeling ultra soft.  </li>
      <li>Simple coconut oil does a better job than this cleanser, and leaves my skin smelling/feeling</li>
      <li>Non drying, leaves my face feeling soft and clean</li>
      <li>Have also used the fruit enzyme cleanser from this line and that is a great choice too - especially for summer since it is a bit less moisturizing than the pumpkin cleanser.</li>
      <li>The smell is nice, was a little drying.</li>
      <li>, so I&#x27;ve started with the Pumpkin cleanser, the Deep Repair Cream and the Fabulous Eye Cream.  </li>
      <li>It is gentle and yet cleans my face well.</li>
      <li>Gentle cleanser  </li>
      <li>I really like this cleanser.</li>
      <li>Creamy and very hydrating.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle, but if you leave it on your skin for a few minutes you can feel your skin start to warm</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin on my face and this stuff makes my face feel super soft and silky.</li>
      <li>Other reviewers seem to love it though, so maybe it&#x27;s just me.</li>
      <li>I have to use another brand of facial wash just to clean the brush.</li>
      <li>strongly recommend it to people with dry skin.</li>
      <li>This is the first face cleanser that has help my redness &amp; keep my face clear.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not enough to keep me from using it, but I&#x27;m trying the honeydew unscented next to see if it&#x27;s better.</li>
      <li>If you are more used to a foaming cleanser than it will definitely feel different.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>so I have tried far more cleansers than the average consumer, including many of the most expensive ones on the market, and Creamy Pumpkin tops them all.  </li>
      <li>This cleanser leaves my skin feeling clean, without being dry or oily.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not bad, per se, but I expected miracles that didn&#x27;t really happen.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought a few MyChelle products, and I don&#x27;t love any of them.</li>
      <li>Great for sensitive skin and for those dry, harsh winter months!</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin, prone to rosesea, acne, and dryness and this stuff</li>
      <li>Ok so I&#x27;m kinda obsessed with skincare because my skin no matter what I do is always super dehydrated.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a natural smell</li>
      <li>The smell is great--spicy and cinnamon-y--and the texture is soft and creamy.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I would suggest buying this product only if one has very very dry skin.  my skin is combo.  I counted 4 new large blackheads (sorry if this is tmi) after I used this product for just two weeks.  also, my pores got very large.  within a day or two after I stopped using the product, my pores got significantly smaller.  for those reviewers who don&#x27;t like the smell, to me it smells like noxzema. I could live with the smell if it worked well for me, but it was honestly the worst facial cleanser that I have ever used.  I didn&#x27;t feel that it cleaned well at all.  I used it with a cleansing brush and it left a residue that I had to wash off with another cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the two top ingredients are glycerin and coconut oil.  the product does say DRY on the label, but I didn&#x27;t see that in the photo on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I&#x27;d use it to wash my hands, but it doesn&#x27;t work well for that either.  bye bye mychelle pumpkin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years. I started using this as my skin was so sensitive to anything. I tried several products including Cetaphil and everything would make my face red and irritated. I was told by a representative to make sure I tried it for at least a few weeks. I didn&#x27;t need that long...there was improvement after the first few days. NO more redness or irritation. Like I said been using it for years and have had no problems. I also use the revitalizing nighttime cream(unscented) plus I have used their stick foundation which is great also!</li>
    <li> this was the awful. I tossed the rest. greasy. smelly. had to wash my face after using it. yuk</li>
    <li> Having recently found the need to go \\&quot;Gluten Free\\&quot; I have had to switch facial products as well, it&#x27;s amazing just what you&#x27;ll find gluten in.  MyChelle Dermaceuticals has provided an excellent array of products to choose from all of which are gluten and wheat free.  I&#x27;ve only used 3 products so far, as I&#x27;ve just had to switch in the last 2 weeks.  But I like what I&#x27;ve tried.  I have very dry skin, year round, so I&#x27;ve started with the Pumpkin cleanser, the Deep Repair Cream and the Fabulous Eye Cream.  I&#x27;m not looking for something to remove wrinkles-as this cannot happen unless you have surgery.  But I&#x27;m happy with the results thus far on my skin staying hydrated.  I purchase most of my facial products from Vitacost, but I did want to leave a review on Amazon because I often refer to customer opinions from here.  (I do shop a great deal from Amazon too - excellent prices!)</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin that is prone to redness and breakouts and this all-natural product is wonderful.  It has a light pumpkin scent and a creamy texture that leaves your skin feeling ultra soft.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is my second time buying this product. I have very sensitive skin on my face and this stuff makes my face feel super soft and silky. After a week of using it, I got a lot of compliments on my healthy, glowing complexion.</li>
    <li> I really love this cleanser.  I have been on the lookout for cleansers that are more natural and this really fits the bill.  If you haven&#x27;t used a &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; cleanser it may take some getting used to.  If you are more used to a foaming cleanser than it will definitely feel different.  I have been looking for a more natural cleanser, since it is a product I use twice a day on my skin, I am trying to be more conscious of what I am using.  This cleanser leaves my skin feeling clean, without being dry or oily.  By nature, I have combination skin and this cleanser is neutral for both types.</li>
    <li> I think this is a good natural product by an ethical company. I am still getting used to it. It feels a bit thick almost like a lotion so the feel is deffernt than soap. But my skin seems to like it so I will keep using it. My skin is dry and senstitive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products and MyChelle consistently pulls through.  The Pumpkin Cleanser is their best selling product yet!</li>
    <li> I had high hopes due to the review. It&#x27;s not bad, per se, but I expected miracles that didn&#x27;t really happen. I have very dry skin (Midwest winters aren&#x27;t helping), but also a bit of acne on my forehead, and this hasn&#x27;t really helped either thing. The &amp;#34;creamy&amp;#34; in the title made me think it would be actively moisturizing my face as I washed, but I don&#x27;t really notice a difference between using this and using my regular Cetaphil.&lt;br /&gt;As for the smell, I do kind of like it, actually.&lt;br /&gt;Not bad, but not amazing. Other reviewers seem to love it though, so maybe it&#x27;s just me.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser. I have sensitive skin and this cleanser does not irritate it and does not dry my face out. Plus it smells delightful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for a year. It goes a great job - cleans really well, but doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
    <li> It smells great, I love the creamy texture. My skin feels invigorated and moisterized after use.will definitely buy and check out more products.</li>
    <li> Turned to a watery mixture. Was very hard to use afterwards. The smell is nice, was a little drying. Wasnt really able to use it after it changed. Cant really recommend as the product went bad after a week</li>
    <li> This product is a great cleanser, and also does a good job removing makeup.  We have been using this for years and will keep coming back!!</li>
    <li> I love this product. Such a  a great deal, it is more affordable than Walgreens.</li>
    <li> I really like this cleanser. It is gentle and yet cleans my face well. I will continue using it is product.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser. It smells incredible and leaves your skin feeling so smooth and clean. The ingredients are pure and good quality. Plus, a little bit goes a long way so the bottle lasts a long time!</li>
    <li> The only cleanser I use, natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> The ignorance regarding the scent of this lotion is staggering. What you&#x27;re smelling ladies is CLOVES. Lovely, pungent clove. The clove leaves a little tingly feel (not unlike the old noxema cream).  No chemicals, but a powerful scent that would certainly annoy if you don&#x27;t like it. This cream is awesome for my dry skin. Creamy and very hydrating. A keeper for sure !</li>
    <li> This is a good cleanser for my dry skin. It removes every trace of makeup without drying, and I have to use very little moisturizer overnight. I&#x27;m just not a fan of the scent, which is nothing like pumpkin. It&#x27;s not enough to keep me from using it, but I&#x27;m trying the honeydew unscented next to see if it&#x27;s better.</li>
    <li> Ok so I&#x27;m kinda obsessed with skincare because my skin no matter what I do is always super dehydrated.  This cleanser is nothing short of amazing and by far the best cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used. It somehow cleans yet soothes and keeps my skin hydrated. It doesn&#x27;t foam up it&#x27;s more like a cream but foaming cleansers are full of nasty chemicals and you don&#x27;t need a cleanser to foam in order to cleanse properly. Be warned tho it doesn&#x27;t smell great....... At first the smell bothered me because you expect a pumpkin smell and it definitely isn&#x27;t that. It&#x27;s a natural smell no chemicals but definitely not pumpkin.  Yet it worked so well I ignored the smell and by the 3rd use I don&#x27;t even notice it anymore and it doesn&#x27;t linger so don&#x27;t fear no one will smell it on you.. I&#x27;m excited to try more from mychelle I&#x27;m REALLY impressed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I only purchased the small bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For starters, this--for lack of a better term--smells like old lady perfume; it&#x27;s cloying and stays on your skin all day, so I wouldn&#x27;t buy it unless you want to smell like rose potpourri with a touch of baby powder (in no way does this smell like pumpkin). It literally has a chemical STENCH, like walking past a yankee candle shop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My bad decision to purchase this was born of a desire to find a gentle cleanser for the removal of eye makeup; at least one reviewer said this was good at makeup removal, so that tipped me on my purchase decision. In my experience, this does a terrible job of makeup removal (all my cosmetics are Tarte, for reference); the only time it did a mediocre job of removing any makeup was when I scrubbed with a washcloth, so I give my arm and the washcloth more credit than the cleanser. This does such a bad job and the smell is so offensive (and lingers for so long) that I only use this as sort of a pre-rinse when I am about to get in the shower, because otherwise I can smell it on me all day. The lingering stench also makes me concerned about what they are using to make the fragrance, because natural fragrances (in my experience) usually only hang around for a short period of time. It also leaves a powdery-feeling film on my face unless I follow it up with a better cleanser. Simple coconut oil does a better job than this cleanser, and leaves my skin smelling/feeling better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s 2 stars on effectiveness (because it does a poor job on the &#x27;cleanse&#x27;), but the stench is what brings it down to 1 for me. I was really disappointed because MyChelle is a natural brand with products that are generally pretty highly reviewed. Feel free to try this if you like artificial cloying floral scents or have reactive dry skin (I am combo) and do not wear any makeup. For the quality, this is also overpriced by about 60%. I&#x27;m so dissatisfied with this, my first experience, that I&#x27;m not sureif I will ever try another MyChelle product (especially without being able to smell it first).</li>
    <li> great cleanser - best i&#x27;ve ever used. makes my face feel clean after a day of makeup. It smells great, and my face feels so smooth after each use - gentle enough to use twice a day.</li>
    <li> I like the smell and the way my skin feels, but it does not do a good job of removing makeup and dirt. I use one of those spin brush devices to wash my face and there is always this oily residue that does not wash off. I have to use another brand of facial wash just to clean the brush. That being said, I use a toner to get the rest of the makeup and dirt off. I like this products, but would not reorder.</li>
    <li> Love every MyChelle product on the market!!</li>
    <li> This cleanser is a must have for dry skin.  It leaves your face feeling like velvet.  I worked in the cosmetics industry for over a decade so I have tried far more cleansers than the average consumer, including many of the most expensive ones on the market, and Creamy Pumpkin tops them all.  It also has a uniquely yummy scent.  Please MyChelle, make a larger size!</li>
    <li> This is simply the best cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used.  The smell is great--spicy and cinnamon-y--and the texture is soft and creamy.  It cleans well without being too foamy, which I appreciate.  I have very sensitive skin, prone to rosesea, acne, and dryness and this stuff keeps it all in check.  I&#x27;ve tried many different options and this is the best.</li>
    <li> Discovered this cleanser by accident...but love it!  If you are looking for a gentle, natural product with excellent cleansing ability, this is it.  It it wonderful for removing make up also.  It has a heavy pumpkin pie spice smell but I happen to love pumpkin pie!  Have also used the fruit enzyme cleanser from this line and that is a great choice too - especially for summer since it is a bit less moisturizing than the pumpkin cleanser.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought a few MyChelle products, and I don&#x27;t love any of them. They all smell a bit medicinal, and haven&#x27;t done anything for my skin. I&#x27;m switching back to the Yes to Carrots creamy cleanser, which smells and feels nicer than this one.</li>
    <li> cleanses without being harsh  smells divine</li>
    <li> Great for sensitive skin and for those dry, harsh winter months! Really gives your skin that added moisture and softness in a face wash, which is rare.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing on my finicky combination skin. It doesn&#x27;t irritate or dry my skin like all other cleansers.&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend it to people with dry skin. It doesn&#x27;t foam - maybe because it&#x27;s free of unnecessary chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is small but lasts for a very long time. I didn&#x27;t get mine on Amazon but at my local Whole Foods, where one of the employees recommended this product. I&#x27;ll be getting more from Amazon now.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with all of the MyChelle products that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for several years and I always go back to it. I&#x27;ve tried other MyChelle products and I alternate but this is my favorite. Very gentle for mature/dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;Product arrived quickly and was exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> Gentle cleanser  on my 50+ skin.  I have tried others,  &amp; felt like they dried out my face.  Been using this brand/  type for a while &amp; am Very happy.  Will continue to use.  No problem w/ scent,  either.</li>
    <li> Love this face wash! It&#x27;s gentle, but if you leave it on your skin for a few minutes you can feel your skin start to warm (I assume from the enzymes breaking down dead skin and dirt). It does not irritate or strip my skin. I still have to use a moisturizer after, but my face has a tendency to dry out after washing so that&#x27;s no surprise. I usually use this after exfoliating with a salt-oil scrub from Trader Joe&#x27;s, and together they seem to be helping my blackheads. No artificial frangrance, but it has a nice scent, kind of like there are mild spices in it or something. It doesn&#x27;t later but applies creamy to the skin. I recommend letting it sit a few minutes and even exfoliating gently before rinsing it off. It does not strip the skin in my experience, but it does take care of oily buildup.</li>
    <li> This is the first face cleanser that has help my redness &amp; keep my face clear. I recommend this with anyone who has dry skin.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful cleanser. Smells delightful. Non drying, leaves my face feeling soft and clean</li>
    <li> Only cleanser I have found that really works for my face. Use wipes to remove makeup before cleansing for best results.</li>
