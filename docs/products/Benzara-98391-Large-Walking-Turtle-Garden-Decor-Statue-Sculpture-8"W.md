      <li>Upon opening the package I immediately ordered 3 more, 1 for me and 2 for gifts for friends.</li>
      <li>I get so many compliments.  </li>
      <li>I thought he might be a good addition to her garden and might even scare the bunnies away from her plants but as long as she likes him inside, that&#x27;s great too.</li>

      <li>it&#x27;s smaller version (found in Home &amp; Kitchen) which I also ordered are gorgeous!</li>
      <li>I bought this guy for my turtle garden but he looks like he will break easily</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m sure it will look nice next to my cousin&#x27;s garden pond.</li>
      <li>The turtle arrived quickly and was well packed.</li>

      <li>they are that pretty!</li>
      <li>This turtle is pretty cool...</li>
      <li>In my opinion this turtle is too nice to put outside.  </li>
      <li>I read the other reviews that mentioned great detail and vibrant colors.  </li>
      <li>This is the larger version (I also bought the smaller one) and they look very nice together, side by sidel.</li>
      <li>You won&#x27;t believe how lovely it is nor the low price you paid for it.</li>
      <li>It is hard to find anything for the yard that still looks good after one sumer that is not expensive!</li>
      <li>They are beautifully crafted but are too tiny for an average lawn garden.</li>
      <li>This turtle really is on the small side and isn&#x27;t  remarkable in any way.</li>
      <li>However it is large enough to be seen and has a &#x27;happy&#x27; presence in my little garden.  </li>
      <li>The shell of the turtle is really shiny which adds to piece.</li>

      <li>Really like the size and the coloring of this turtle.</li>
      <li>I shipped it straight to her and haven&#x27;t gotten to see it yet.</li>
      <li>This little guy or girl seems to rule our flower bed and gets more compliments than some very health flowers.</li>
      <li>Love this little guy for my strawberry garden in the summer.</li>
      <li>I have not met this cute little turtle in person since it was a gift.  </li>
      <li>Love this little guy.</li>
      <li>Got it yesterday (7/15) and it&#x27;s already in the flower bed at the front door right next to the &amp;#34;bunnies&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Reviews are right about the actual size and weight.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this little guy!</li>
      <li>I bought it to replace a cast concrete turtle that disintegrated near a pond.</li>
      <li>If only &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; meant large.  </li>
      <li>I have mine in the house sitting next to a large Peace Plant.  </li>
      <li>This little guy is so adorable that I can&#x27;t say enough about it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little smaller than we would have liked, but he is now sitting next to our pond, peeking out from the rocks and everyone adores him!</li>
      <li>I received the package today and immediately noticed it was nowhere near the 8 lbs that is in the product description.</li>
      <li>Items are missed marked.  </li>
      <li>but it is completely mismarked by packing company.  </li>
      <li>Cute, but unless your garden is very small, it would disappear.  </li>
      <li>Still looks brand new after several weeks of 90 to a 100 degree weather.</li>
      <li>This was purchased and shipped directly as a gift to a relative.  </li>
      <li>It was too small to be useful.  </li>

    <li> This little guy is so adorable that I can&#x27;t say enough about it.  I get so many compliments.  It&#x27;s very realistic looking and is perfect in my garden among the bursts of color.</li>
    <li> Items are missed marked.  It therefore was completely useless for what I had in mind.  It was too small to be useful.  The box says 8lbs but it is completely mismarked by packing company.  They are beautifully crafted but are too tiny for an average lawn garden.</li>
    <li> Pretty little turtle,  hard to see on mulch and not very big at all.</li>
    <li> I have not met this cute little turtle in person since it was a gift.  My sister-in-law said she loves it and has placed him on her hearth by the fire.  I thought he might be a good addition to her garden and might even scare the bunnies away from her plants but as long as she likes him inside, that&#x27;s great too.</li>
    <li> Very well-made outdoor garden statue.  I have a Zen garden and am using the turtle according to feng shui principles.</li>
    <li> This turtle is stunning. The photograph doesn&#x27;t do it justice. It&#x27;s beautifully made with shell details and colors that are beyond what I expected. Upon opening the package I immediately ordered 3 more, 1 for me and 2 for gifts for friends. You won&#x27;t believe how lovely it is nor the low price you paid for it. I&#x27;m extremely happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kathy H.&lt;br /&gt;Woodland, CA</li>
    <li> Love this little guy. Wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like him but he looks great in my yard.</li>
    <li> I love turtles... this one is a bit different.  It&#x27;s heavy and seems sturdy.  I love the shell.  We&#x27;ll see how it holds up outdoors.</li>
    <li> I received the package today and immediately noticed it was nowhere near the 8 lbs that is in the product description. Once I got it out of the packaging I would say it is maybe 1.5 pounds and really small. I cant blame anyone for the size because I believe they do mention it is only 5&amp;#34;x7&amp;#34; so that is my fault, but I don&#x27;t think this will go in the garden. It feels much more like a plastic toy than a stone garden sculpture. I will say it is good looking, just not what I thought I was buying.</li>
    <li> I love this turtle. It&#x27;s smaller than what I would have liked but the details are nice. I will use it in my indoor plant room.</li>
    <li> This little guy or girl seems to rule our flower bed and gets more compliments than some very health flowers.</li>
    <li> Love this little guy for my strawberry garden in the summer. I wish I would of gotten two.  Great purchase.</li>
    <li> My 14 month granddaughter loves turtles so we purchased it for the garden and for her. The turtle is shiny and looks great. The turtle arrived quickly and was well packed.</li>
    <li> this turtle is so very nice, that i will not put it outside.  I have it indoors.  Good quality and attractive</li>
    <li> So cute----I ordered another one. Gave one to my daughter. He is a cutie</li>
    <li> We all love the paint and glaze on this guy! It&#x27;s a little smaller than we would have liked, but he is now sitting next to our pond, peeking out from the rocks and everyone adores him!</li>
    <li> Very nice and looks great next to my pond. Georgia weather destroys almost everything! We have tremendous heat and humidity plus snow and ice in the winter. It is hard to find anything for the yard that still looks good after one sumer that is not expensive! Still looks brand new after several weeks of 90 to a 100 degree weather. Good price</li>
    <li> I bought this guy for my turtle garden but he looks like he will break easily so I kept him in the house.  Nice turtle.</li>
    <li> This turtle is pretty cool...the shell is my favorite part...not a fan of the silver legs and head...wish it would have been done in a more natural finish like the shell.  $11.99 was a fair price.  I&#x27;m sure it will look nice next to my cousin&#x27;s garden pond.</li>
    <li> Got it yesterday (7/15) and it&#x27;s already in the flower bed at the front door right next to the &amp;#34;bunnies&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Perfect addition for the garden.</li>
    <li> Looks better in person than on computer screen. Looks great with my backyard water feature. Excellent value for the buck.</li>
    <li> Very handsome turtle with beautiful marbling in the stone that can&#x27;t be appreciated from the online photos.  Not sure I will put it outside but it looks great on the coffee table!</li>
    <li> Very cute and durable!</li>
    <li> I did read the reviews before purchasing this. This turtle really is on the small side and isn&#x27;t  remarkable in any way. I am not happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This turtle and it&#x27;s smaller version (found in Home &amp; Kitchen) which I also ordered are gorgeous! Although smaller than I expected in size. The weight given is 7.8 pounds. It is actually 1 pound 4 ounces. The dimensions given make no sense at all. The actual dimensions are 7.5\\&quot;L x 5\\&quot;W x 3.5\\&quot;H. I was looking for something bigger and thought from the weight given that this would be it. I will keep them and find another use for them...they are that pretty!</li>
    <li> This turtle is beautiful.  I put it outside and then after a week or so I decided to bring it inside because it looks so nice.</li>
    <li> Nicely made.  In my opinion this turtle is too nice to put outside.  I have mine in the house sitting next to a large Peace Plant.  The shell of the turtle is really shiny which adds to piece.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister who was renovating her garden. I shipped it straight to her and haven&#x27;t gotten to see it yet. I asked her to write the review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This turtle is almost too beautiful to put outside.  It captures the movement of turtles perfectly.  The turtles that wander into my yard will take a second look at this beauty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And there you have it. Now I want one.</li>
    <li> Yeah, it&#x27;s made in China, but I really like it for the price. The shell has patterns and colors that you won&#x27;t believe, and the details of the skin and face are very nice. I bought it to replace a cast concrete turtle that disintegrated near a pond. This one is nicer, cost less, and won&#x27;t fall apart. Reviews are right about the actual size and weight.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my deck at my lake house. The word &amp;#34;Large&amp;#34; is truly deceiving.  It is no near that. I read the other reviews that mentioned great detail and vibrant colors.  The shell is dull in color and the head/legs are silver making it not look realistic at all.  The only pro to this item, is the weight.  This helps so it will not blow away easily.  I put it on my deck anyway, and did not receive any compliments.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice piece . . . but &amp;#34;larrge&amp;#34; should not be in the description. It is quite small! . . . Just about actual turtle size.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this little guy! He&#x27;s perfect. Very shiny coat (which looks pretty durable) and great detail. He&#x27;s now sitting on part of a tree stump in my garden - I&#x27;m reserving total judgement to see how he fares through a NC winter. But right now, he&#x27;s the perfect addition to my flower bed!</li>
    <li> Looks great and has been outside with no changes in color of the turtle.</li>
    <li> Really like the size and the coloring of this turtle. Very nice - so nice that it is inside my house.</li>
    <li> If only &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; meant large.  It&#x27;s small but heavy I do have the perfect place to put it in my flower garden.</li>
    <li> beautiful , son wanted when he saw it. will need one forme.</li>
    <li> Cute, but unless your garden is very small, it would disappear.  If this was a large, I&#x27;d hate to see what a small looked like!</li>
    <li> This was purchased and shipped directly as a gift to a relative.  She said she liked it, so I suppose it was OK.</li>
    <li> Well, don&#x27;t think it actually walks!!  (grin).  However it is large enough to be seen and has a &#x27;happy&#x27; presence in my little garden.  I believe it will &#x27;weather&#x27; well - it has a nice sheen about it.</li>
    <li> This is the larger version (I also bought the smaller one) and they look very nice together, side by sidel. There is a beautiful  shine to the shell so I keep it indoors so I can see and enjoy them more often.  Also, it&#x27;s lightweight but still has a substantial feel to it.</li>
    <li> this little guy sits on a rock that I have near a small waterfall in my garden.  He looks perfect and doesn&#x27;t blow over , very good quality</li>
    <li> Very good quality.We have two in the back yard with the collection of frogs.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s difficult to tell from a photo what the quality of an item will be.  This garden statue was beyond what I had hoped for.  The detail, quality and size of the turtle are top-of-the-line.  I would recommend this item to anyone considering an outdoor ornament for their garden.  The seller was prompt with delivery.</li>
