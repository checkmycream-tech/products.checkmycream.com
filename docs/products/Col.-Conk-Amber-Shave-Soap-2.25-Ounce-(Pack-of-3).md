      <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed my skin drying out or getting oily, but there&#x27;s also nothing about this soap in conjunction with my current razor or brush that is making me jump up for joy and scream about it from the heavens.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve used the Art of Shaving lavendar shaving cream which doesn&#x27;t lather up particularly well either, but it has far more lubrication for your face and it smells great.</li>
      <li>As with all Colonel Conk soaps, they lather quickly and easily and rinse clean with no film or residue.</li>

      <li>I have been using the old brush and mug system and have found many of the soaps to be lacking until I found Col. Conk Amber Shaving Soap.  </li>
      <li>It takes a lot more time than other brands but the results are better.</li>
      <li>he was totally right.  </li>
      <li>packaged and sent out right</li>
      <li>you have sensitive skin and an easily bothered sense of smell</li>
      <li>bought this at the end of May 2013 and have gone through the first shaving soap in November.</li>
      <li>When you use a warmed cup and hot water, beard hairs and stubble give way to soft and smooth skin in a matter of a few swipes with a good razor.</li>
      <li>I think I prefer the Bay Rum, but these are my second favorite.</li>
      <li>I always get a smooth painless shave and my skin feels soft and lubricated.</li>
      <li>Better than canned shaving foam by a long shot.</li>

      <li>so I do not know much about it.</li>

      <li>Decent smell.</li>
      <li>\\&quot;I like that smell\\&quot;) and it doesn&#x27;t particularly lubricate the skin for a close shave.</li>
      <li>One cake lasts me for at least a month of shaves and the amber scent is my favorite, a mild masculine smell.</li>
      <li>A little pricey, but still my favorite.</li>
      <li>The scent to me is mild compared to other brands.</li>
      <li>scent that goes great with cold weather.</li>
      <li>It costs more, but a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>I prefer Colonel Conk soap to other brands because it is glycerin, and glycerin soap produces a nice dense slick lather.</li>
      <li>They lather very well, but don&#x27;t last as long as a non-glycerin soap would.</li>
      <li>It lathers quite well and stays wet for a reasonable amount of time.</li>
      <li>it lathers well and does not dry up as fast as other soaps I have used.</li>
      <li>Does not dry out my face.</li>
      <li>I soak the brush under hot water and fling out a little water and proceed to suds up the soap.</li>
      <li>, I highly recommend this soap for all wet shavers with the same issues as myself.</li>
      <li>Leave my skin soft with a close shave, not dry like other shaving soaps.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m having trouble getting a good thick lather, always seems runny, but that&#x27;s likely bad technique more than a failing of this soap.</li>

    <li> This soap is amazing on my sensitive skin. There is hardly any scent to be had, and the scent you are able to smell is so light and pleasant, you won&#x27;t want to reach for anything else. It lathers quite well and stays wet for a reasonable amount of time. I usually lather my face first, shave, then lather my neck and shave again. When you use a warmed cup and hot water, beard hairs and stubble give way to soft and smooth skin in a matter of a few swipes with a good razor. It lubricates nicely and my safety razor slides through my 3-4 days of stubble growth with relative ease when using this shave soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive skin and an easily bothered sense of smell, I highly recommend this soap for all wet shavers with the same issues as myself. You won&#x27;t be disappointed, especially at the price you are paying and the quality that Col. Conk pushes into their products. Take note, this soap should last you quite a while, as a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Best mug soap ever!  Price is great too.</li>
    <li> not the most expensive but I prefer this soap because of the luxurious foam, glycerin moisturizer, and the pleasing scent. Lasts for quite some time as well (this is my 3rd purchase of the Col. Conk brand soap).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well packaged and sent out right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do have to have a shaving brush to use it for those not in the know</li>
    <li> I read the great things about this product and decided to purchase some and give it a try. Quite honestly it&#x27;s just ok. It doesn&#x27;t lather up particularly well, it has a very light sent (which is fine, but it doesn&#x27;t make you say, \\&quot;I like that smell\\&quot;) and it doesn&#x27;t particularly lubricate the skin for a close shave. I&#x27;ve used the Art of Shaving lavendar shaving cream which doesn&#x27;t lather up particularly well either, but it has far more lubrication for your face and it smells great. It costs more, but a little goes a long way. I&#x27;ll stick with AOS unless I can find another soap which is reasonably priced and works better than this.</li>
    <li> This soap gets the job done it feels good works good and smells great and the way it cleans as it shaves feels great.</li>
    <li> This is good soap, I just prefer the lime scent more. It has a mild after shave kind of scent, where the lime reminds me more of margaritas. The aftershave is not over powering though.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shaving soap.  The lime is also nice but the feel and smell of the amber is my favorite.</li>
    <li> I have been using the old brush and mug system and have found many of the soaps to be lacking until I found Col. Conk Amber Shaving Soap.  I always get a smooth painless shave and my skin feels soft and lubricated.</li>

    <li> Much better than the squeeze bottle stuff. I&#x27;m having trouble getting a good thick lather, always seems runny, but that&#x27;s likely bad technique more than a failing of this soap. Decent smell. Not overpowering. Melts well into a coffee mug to use as a base.</li>
    <li> My favorite shaving soap. Been using it for years.</li>
    <li> I prefer Colonel Conk soap to other brands because it is glycerin, and glycerin soap produces a nice dense slick lather. So it helps your razor glide very smoothly and the result is a very close and comfortable shave. And the lather doesn&#x27;t dry out on your face during shaving. One cake lasts me for at least a month of shaves and the amber scent is my favorite, a mild masculine smell. A boar brush works best with this soap because a glycerin cake is somewhat hard and the stiff boar bristles work well to develop a lather that is just the right consistency. The Colonel Conk boar brush is a good match with this soap.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Col. Conk Bay Rum ones for a while and thought I&#x27;d switch it up.  These are really nice, have a pleasant smell, and last quite a while.  I think I prefer the Bay Rum, but these are my second favorite.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this 3-pack multiple times, and enjoy it.  It&#x27;s easier for me to shave with a couple of these stacked in a cup, than to have to reach the brush all the way to the bottom to get soap.  They lather very well, but don&#x27;t last as long as a non-glycerin soap would.</li>
    <li> The best soap I have ever used.  Nice and thick and smell is great.  A little pricey, but still my favorite.</li>
    <li> This soap is very effective at helping me with a nice clean shave.  I haven&#x27;t noticed my skin drying out or getting oily, but there&#x27;s also nothing about this soap in conjunction with my current razor or brush that is making me jump up for joy and scream about it from the heavens.</li>
    <li> The glycerin soap is soothing on the skin and does a great job of comfortable lubricating my skin while softening the whiskers to give me a consistently good shave.</li>
    <li> It is not too frothy but soaps up enough to give a smooth shave. He won&#x27;t use anything else. Wonderful.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaving soap I have found.  Leave my skin soft with a close shave, not dry like other shaving soaps.</li>
    <li> This is my winter shave soap -- I use the lime in the summertime. As with all Colonel Conk soaps, they lather quickly and easily and rinse clean with no film or residue. I like this scent in the winter because it&#x27;s a heavier &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34; scent that goes great with cold weather.</li>
    <li> Very happpy with it.  Great lather.  Put in microwave to soften to fit the mug.  Will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I have used this shaving shop for over 20 Yrs.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this and I love the scent!</li>
    <li> Great shaving soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this at the end of May 2013 and have gone through the first shaving soap in November. For shaving 5 days a week this translates to about 5-6 months for each soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lots of lather even with the hard water I have. Smells good too.</li>
    <li> For those who like to shave the old fashion way, this is an excellent product</li>
    <li> This soap smells great, works very well, and fits in my husband&#x27;s shaving cup. It&#x27;s a win-win-win! He likes it too, says it&#x27;s his favorite scent and doesn&#x27;t irritate his sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This is the best case period, lightweight, does this case does not bulk to phone.also comes in other colors looking at getting another case from this company ,GOOD JOB TO ALL.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not fussy, and neither is my beard. I wet-shave using soap and a brush, using the same Gillette Sensor/Excel blades I&#x27;ve been using since forever. But I could get away with using bath soap if I had to. I&#x27;ve used everything from Williams to hand-made artisan soaps without issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Conk soap lathers better than what I&#x27;m used to, and it has a pleasant smell. It does the job of lubricating my face at least as well as anything else I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s not so thick that I can&#x27;t see the edges of my goatee to shave up to the edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These three bars look like they&#x27;ll last me for a couple of years, too.</li>
    <li> i was always a shave gel kinda guy.  i used gilette fusion gel for years, and my buddy told me to lose that stuff and try shave soap instead.  he was totally right.  i combo this stuff with an exfoliating wash before shaving and an alum bar and shave balm after i shave and i have never gotten a smoother shave with less irritation.  if you are thinking about buying this product, do it.</li>
    <li> hubby loves this stuff.  he shaves with a mug and bristle brush and this is one of his fav soaps.</li>
    <li> Best shaving soap, smells great, lathers better and last a long time.  Better than canned shaving foam by a long shot.</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance, decent lather ... decent life.  I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Good soap, makes your beard very smooth, smells good</li>
    <li> I have been wet shaving for less than a month so I do not know much about it. Even though, I have tried 3 different brands. What I can say about this brand is a little different than the rest. I notice it foams up a lot better when the shaving brush is wetter. I soak the brush under hot water and fling out a little water and proceed to suds up the soap. It takes a lot more time than other brands but the results are better. The scent to me is mild compared to other brands. I am not sure if I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> it lathers well and does not dry up as fast as other soaps I have used.</li>
    <li> Great soap. Great value. Better than the high dollar men&#x27;s department store varieties. Lathers well. Does not dry out my face.</li>
