<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This came faster then i thought it would. I love it when i make my home mask and things. Really good. and for a really good price!</li>
    <li> Its the perfect size for me. The measuring cups help alot. If had it and used it many times and hasnt fallen apart on me like ive seen previous reviewers say. I enjoyed my products and will order from them again</li>
    <li> great little bowl set for mixing the powder masks.  Delivery was so long, I forgot I had ordered this item, but it does come from Hong Kong.  I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I love facials! This tool makes such activity a blast because I would only rely on myself rather than a professional to apply facials.</li>
    <li> This actually made my mask mixing more easier. The lil mix spatula is perfect has the lil measuring scoops and a brush to apply the mask. Only bad thing is that it took a long while to get here because its coming from china. But I didn&#x27;t mind because I wasnt in a hurry to receive it.</li>
    <li> Cheap. The brush broke after two uses.</li>
    <li> Metric measurements. Also, the bristles on the brush fall off during mask application.</li>
    <li> The product is very small.  Upon arrival I noticed the item had been opened and restapled, very disappointed!</li>
    <li> Got this to mix up face masks that require a non-reactive bowl.  It&#x27;s tiny, but plenty big enough and perfect for this purpose.</li>
    <li> It seems like it was opened/used before because the plastic casing it&#x27;s in is stapled closed. Also, the brush has a scratch on the handle and is extremely stiff, even after washing it and running warm water over it for awhile. At least it was cheap and a perfect size for my mask.    Lol I just noticed.. the blue set was supposed to come with a brush with a blue tip as well. I got a pink brush with the rest of the set being blue. Weird how they mix things up like that. Makes me wonder what goes on over there. But oh well.</li>
    <li> Great for a variety of beauty products.</li>
    <li> I liked it but it is a very small cup.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. I bought this for the Indian clay mask I bought on here and the brush is totally useless with a clay mask. I wound up just applying it with my hands. The bowl is so tiny I had to slowly mix it so it wouldn&#x27;t spill everywhere. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Very cheap, very practical. SURE, you can use a regular bowl and spoon, but this little kit has all you need for a mask, and since I live in a dorm room and it is a hassle to go all the way into the kitchen to get my one good glass bowl, I like to leave this next to my amazon clay mask in my beauty drawer, to make it easier (and more likely) for me to squeeze in a 15-minute mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just go to the sink, measure out a tablespoon of powder and a tablespoon of water with the included tablespoon, mix up the mask in the bowl with the paddle, and then use the brush to smoothly apply. Once I have applied the mask and set the 15-minute timer on my phone, I quickly rinse the bowl, spoons, and brushes in the sink in less than a minute and rush back to my room (and growl scarily at any person that laughs at me in the hallway). I then plop down and enjoy some guilty-pleasure Netflix shows with some pre-maid instant iced tea (bendy straw included, of course) like the glamour queen I secretly am.</li>
    <li> Works great for exactly wht I need..nothing more nothing less</li>
    <li> Nice facial mask mixer bowl. Had all the measuring spoons and brush and applicator necessary. I use it every single time I prepare my clay facial mask. Great buy</li>
    <li> I love this thing..very handy</li>
    <li> This product is exactly as pictured. My set did match except for the brush which is pink. It&#x27;s a tiny bowl with tiny measuring spoons, tiny paddle, and tiny brush. It&#x27;s the perfect size to mix and apply facial masks. It makes applying them effortless and mess free. Cleanup only takes a second. Yes, it&#x27;s cheaply made. Yes, it looks like a toy. Yes, it looks like it should be sold in a dollar store. It&#x27;s dirt cheap and ships from China. What more can be expected out of it? It gets 4 stars for taking nearly a month to arrive. I know that has to do with customs but if I had known before ordering I would have chosen a different color on Prime shipping. It&#x27;s also not ideal with bentonite clay because of the metal on the brush. It would be better if it was all plastic. Just avoid touching the metal part to the clay. Unfortunately it does creep up the brush toward the metal part anyway. Nonetheless, it&#x27;s perfect given the cheap price.</li>
    <li> Brush is useless, brush part got unstuck and fell while I was using it. The bowl is the size of my hand when cupped. I like the scoops measures and the spatula though. But these things can be purchased at your local dollar store.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and excellent seller ..... indicate to everyone!</li>
    <li> Nice way to mix up the mask ingredients. Made it much easier than using a bowl from the kitchen and just the right size .</li>
    <li> Love the bowl, measuring cup, and mixing knife. The brush however isn&#x27;t made as well as it could be. I have already had the brush come off the handle, so I am wondering how long it&#x27;s going to last</li>
    <li> Simple item but has all as explained and pretty sturdy.</li>
    <li> i did not care for this at all , very cheaply made and to be honest you might be able to find this at a dollar store so don&#x27;t waste your money on this .</li>
    <li> I loved everything expect the brush. The brush doesn&#x27;t have a good glue. The brush is more like a piant brush than a hair brush. What you get is going to cost you more or less based on your luck.</li>
    <li> Great measuring cup for facial clay I used this mixing cup measuring spoons, mixing spoon and paint brush thing. It works like a charm I mixed it with the Aztec secret Indian healing clay. Works well with mixing perfectly. I mix with vinegar water plus the powdered clay. After mixing I used the paint brush to my face. The paint brush is very good to use and feels durable. A tip when using brushes with the facial clays you should wash it right after use before it gets hard and hard to clean.  Good</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay for the money</li>
    <li> It came in green while I&#x27;m pretty sure it shows blue on the pics. Also its oily when it came but its ok, I could easily wash it off. Overall, great quality, definitely worth more than its price but wrong color killed it since I&#x27;m a color paranoia.... Blue is everything to me!!!</li>
    <li> Cheapo product, not at all what I expected,  I threw it away without using it, the bowl was very tiny.</li>
    <li> it isn&#x27;t what I expected.  It was cheap looking.  I expected a more durable product</li>
    <li> India to buy clay mask the use of this treatment, the right size, a good brush. For mixing a small amount. And care is considered very reasonable prices, because cheap products. But I was wrong, I love my case! I would recommend it to a friend! Thank you very much</li>
    <li> It showed up half size smaller than I thought, but the brush is good quality.</li>
    <li> Very cheap. It was like using my daughter&#x27;s toys. Came in 6 weeks after I purchased. I would not recommend this to anyone. Better to just use what you have at home.</li>
    <li> This was just what I was looking for. It&#x27;s great for my masks, my serums and my peels. Great price.</li>
    <li> I use it to mix my face clay. Love!</li>
    <li> Perfect. Does exactly what its supposed to. I use it at least once a week. I&#x27;ve had it for about 6mos now, and have absolutely no complaints</li>
    <li> came earlier than expected delivery. works great for my clay mask routine :)</li>
    <li> I love it. It is very useful. It makes my mask creamy and easy to apply on my face.</li>
    <li> When I orderd this product I did not know that it would have been sooooo small. It is the size a toddler would use! Maybe it was my negligence for not reading the reviews and looking at the measurements! Overall I would have not bought this if I had known it would have been so small!</li>
    <li> This item is a waste of money. The brush I got was not blue, it was pink and made the whole set look miss matched. The brush is also really stiff and the bristles hurt my face. I will never us this product again and I encourage everyone else to look at a different product.</li>
    <li> For the price, it&#x27;s just okay. The bowl and tools are much smaller than expected.</li>
    <li> came today much smaller then expected.</li>
    <li> it tooks so long to get this product and it was not that worthy it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so cute. I love the different tools it comes with, unfortunately the brush keeps un-attaching from the base because the glue didn&#x27;t hold well from what it seems, but overall great for the price. It&#x27;s quite small but don&#x27;t be in shock, it&#x27;s perfect size for a face mask. I don&#x27;t think anyone would need any bigger than that. Will probably order this again.</li>
    <li> Really little, not worth the price, disappointed.</li>
    <li> great product to apply my indian healing clay with.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t expect it to be so small.  Plastic.</li>
    <li> GREAT discounted price. I am pretty sure I got this product, but I have no idea where it is. I obviously haven&#x27;t used it. That being said maybe it&#x27;s discounted, and I can&#x27;t find it because you don&#x27;t really need it. Aren&#x27;t you glad I wrote this review that tells you nothing about the product? You&#x27;re welcome ;)  Ironically, I JUST received this product.  I am so spoiled by Amazon Prime, I thought I received it. I stand by my &amp;#34;great discounted price&amp;#34; aspect to the review.  The reason it is discounted is because the quality is pretty poor. If I use the bowl at all, I can&#x27;t see it standing on it&#x27;s own.  I&#x27;ll try it out, but I honestly wouldn&#x27;t bother with purchasing this set.</li>
    <li> this could have been great, the bowl, stirring stick and measuring scoops are higher quality that I expected but the brush was terrible--the glue (some epoxy type glue or rubber cement) used to stick the bristles had dripped down to the tip essentially making it totally unusable. obvious quality control issues there</li>
    <li> It came much earlier than my expectation, well pack.  It&#x27;s good quality and easy to use</li>
    <li> It is an accurate and easy way to make facial&amp;other types of face masks,etc. However,it is very cheaply made.</li>
    <li> i purchased this to go with the indian  healing clay and it allows my 14 yeqr old son to mix and mask himself..awesome</li>
    <li> If you like to make your own masks at home, this has everything you need. I use mine at least twice a week. I do wish the bowl was just a little bigger, but otherwise, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> I had originally purchases this to be used with my Aztec healing clay and came to realize that I only used 2 or the 4 items (the bowl and measuring scoops) because the other two are very flimsy and not sturdy. So instead I just purchased a $1 E.L.F. Foundation brush from the drugstore. Other than that the shipping took a long time but came faster than the estimated delivery date which was a plus.</li>
    <li> This is ok, a lot smaller than I thought it would be but it serves it&#x27;s purpose well. Easy to mix up my facial masks in and arrived relatively quickly.</li>
    <li> Great for Indian clay mask</li>
    <li> After 2 months of waiting for this product from Hong Kong we finally got it the bowl was cracked and the brush was different then shown, if u want to wait months not kidding btw ordered in January it&#x27;s now the end of March and I just got this, next time I&#x27;ll just burn my money</li>
    <li> The brush started falling apart.</li>
    <li> So disappointed with this purchase, but you truly get what you pay for. This comes with a TINY bowl, and the brush is cheap. As soon as I took it out of the package it was shedding. I would send it back but it&#x27;s not worth it for 2.00. Not sure what all these 5 star reviews are talking about. If I could give it -5 stars I would.</li>
    <li> I rate this product 5, I love this mask bowl brush set, I can mixed mask in a bowl instead of using paper cup, I would tell a friend</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s usable, but very cheap quality.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer glass to plastic, but it works&lt;br /&gt;as it is suppose to. The bowl tilts very&lt;br /&gt;easily.</li>
    <li> When I first saw this, I got the impression that it was the size of a mixing bowl. When I got it, I saw that the big bowl is actually the size of a child&#x27;s teacup and everything is pretty much small. It&#x27;s okay, still usable. I use it to mix Aztec Indian Healing Clay for my face</li>
    <li> I was surprised that I liked this set so well.  It is of perfectly nice quality, the brush is sturdy and is a pleasure to use.  Love the measuring spoons, the spatula is great.  Have no reservations about buying this, it is an asset to any mask, hair, other cosmetic routine.</li>
    <li> I like it very much. I am absolutely amazed at this stuff!This product is high quality and good values!!! good</li>
    <li> it definitely helps preparing my mix for my mask, would recommend it to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;the only bad side is that it took for ever to arrive, but so worth it!</li>
    <li> This thing is made of very cheap flimsy plastic.  The shipping also took an entire month!  I only gave it one extra star because while it&#x27;s horribly cheap, it is possible to mix stuff in it.</li>
    <li> Smaller than I thought</li>
    <li> Broke after one day of having it.</li>
    <li> what can you expect for $4.  i feel like it&#x27;s something from the dollar store that a child would play with.  i purchased this to use with a vinegar / clay mask but then realized that the mask can&#x27;t be used with a plastic bowl anyways.  lame given that this set was suggested to me when i purchased the clay off of amazon.</li>
    <li> I only really bought this for the mixing bowl and spatula looking thing. the brush was a neat addition but I had no use for it. The little measuring cups were a neat addition too, useful. It&#x27;s kinda small but its a facial DIY mask bowl, you don&#x27;t need a lot to put on your face. At least I don&#x27;t. I use azteca clay facial stuff, mix it with some apple cider vinegar, gets the job done. Good price, I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> This set is rather cute, but it really should be pictured next to something to show how small it is.  It&#x27;s adequate for my needs, and easy to find a place to put it away, but buyers should just be aware that the bowl only has a circumference of 10&amp;#34; (the diameter is about 4.5&amp;#34; across).  See it pictured below, next to my wireless mouse (which is only 5&amp;#34; long).</li>
    <li> Very worth the price! Great mixing kit for masks and other similar things!</li>
    <li> Took pretty long to get it delivered but it&#x27;s worth waiting.It&#x27;s very cute mask cowl and looks good quality wise. Brush lil small but it&#x27;s fine.&lt;br /&gt;I like it!</li>
    <li> it is alot smaller than expected. Ordered for a friend and she was a little disappointed. But she said she will use it.</li>
    <li> I use this to mix up a mud mask 1-2 times a week.  It&#x27;s a great set at a great price.  It took longer for it to come in but worth it in the end.</li>
    <li> Cheap but effective. It works and it&#x27;s pretty much all I need.</li>
    <li> Very small play set. Took forever to ship but not worth returning it. Maybe my friends daughter can use it to play beauty salon.</li>
    <li> The cup is small, but it&#x27;s big enough to make a facial in. I use the Indian healing clay and the Moroccan red clay with Apple cider vinegar and the measuring tools aren&#x27;t always used because I just approximate,  but it they&#x27;re nice to have. The thing itself is very nice and was a great price. Shipping wasn&#x27;t fantastic but it wasn&#x27;t terribly urgent, so it was fine. A great purchase overall. And the brush that comes with it is great and very soft, and the bristles don&#x27;t come off at all. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s not sturdy enough to use with thick clay, but it&#x27;s good for milk, honey, or avocado masks.</li>
    <li> This product can only be as good as expected. Remember the price is under $10 bucks. If your the type of person looking for high end quality this may not be the product for you, but it does the job for me. I would not waste my time on a rush delivery because the shipping charge would out weight the cost of your product. If your looking for higher quality put the extra shipping charge toward a higher end product. I purchased an additional one in pink for my Mom. It&#x27;s the thought that counts!!!!</li>
    <li> I like it, it&#x27;s very handy, for the price, can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nothing too fancy but it works great for what I wanted. The price is right too. I have used this set twice now and it seems like it will hold up to plenty more uses. The shipping came really quick. I will most likely order a few more for Christmas gift baskets.</li>
    <li> I just love it. Was perfect for my needs.</li>
    <li> This is cute and handy.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for my aztec clay mask</li>
    <li> Bought a mud mask to mix together and this set makes it so much easier. It came with all the pieces I needed to give myself mini spa treatments at home, and cleanup is a breeze. Obviously it&#x27;s not something you&#x27;d use in a spa, but in your own bathroom or with some friends it&#x27;s pretty neat.</li>
    <li> The bowl is small (teacup sized). the spatula, and measuring cups are great for my weekly facial mask. Very easy to clean and run through the dishwasher. It&#x27;s the perfect size as it doesn&#x27;t take up much space at all.&lt;br /&gt;I will say I never used the brush, it just wasn&#x27;t large enough for me - I use a different brush I bought a while back that works well. I will say it took FOREVER to get to me (almost 4 weeks) because of where it&#x27;s shipped from...so be prepared to wait a while, but it&#x27;s jut so perfect that I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy another set (maybe in another color) and wait very happily for it. For this price...it&#x27;s well worth the wait too!</li>
    <li> When it arrived the package had been opened and stapled shut and the brush was from another package, the tip was pink instead of blue. It was all made of different types of plastic in different shades and was all slightly dirty but it works for what I wanted it for.</li>
    <li> Is so cute and good for my facial and body masks, no more messy countertops.</li>
    <li> This product is very small. It took a very long time to arrive. and the brush broke without being used. I will send a photo later. It comes from out of the country took over a month to arrive.</li>
    <li> Very nice  brush, spoons, bowl .</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as big as I expected. The bowl was small and the measuring spoons are not in teaspoons and tablespoons. It&#x27;s ok but not the best.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t know about this bowl yet as I have not used it yet,If I had I may have rated it higher. Thanks Linda</li>
    <li> The price and quality certainly match one another. Ah, the set it TINY, the bowl is small and it doesn&#x27;t really balance well when there is product inside. Oh well.</li>
    <li> tooks a LONG time to get. I forgot I even ordered it by the time it showed up. Cheap brush and the bowl is WAY too small</li>
    <li> Brush fell apart ..which is the only reason I really bought it. The rest of the items I have in my kitchen. Mistake purchase, even for the low price.</li>
    <li> This item is good but, small&lt;br /&gt;A &#x27;ll.  I like type he smooth spoon and t :) e brush is great.</li>
    <li> does what its meant to.&lt;br /&gt;i use it once a week.&lt;br /&gt;highly recommended, took over a month to arrive, but thats ok since it come from over seas</li>
    <li> Shipping took forever and the product was super cheaply made and just trash, so that&#x27;s where it went. In the trash. Not worth returning.</li>
    <li> This product was fine for the price. The bowl, measuring spoons, and spatula work just fine. The brush on the other hand was of poor quality. The brush head separated from the handle on the first use. Nothing a bit of glue couldn&#x27;t fix but it could have come glued as well.</li>
    <li> Extremely small, but I like it because the brush is very soft, the spoon it just right for stirring​, and the measuring spoon comes in handy!</li>
    <li> This is a complete disappointment.  Everything is so small, I don&#x27;t even understand how you could use it for anything. The bowl, the brush, the spoon, it all looks like kids play toys.  Also, I ordered a blue one and the one that came in the mail a month and a half later is green.  The only good part is the price but it&#x27;s so small it shouldn&#x27;t cost anymore than it does.</li>
    <li> Love it! Really useful for making facial masks.</li>
    <li> I bought it because it was very cheap and thought it would be convenient to have a bowl and a set just to use for clay. As simple as a plastic set of bowl, brush, etc. can be, it has proved very very convenient. Could I do the same stuff with a regular kitchen bowl? Of course I could, but it&#x27;s useful to have this set only for this purpose. The small spoons will make me save a lot of clay which I was wasting before, and the brush is useful to apply it properly. It is fairly small, which in my opinion is a positive, rather than negative aspect, as it is very easy to keep around. It&#x27;s just a plastic bowl, spoons, etc. nothing special, but I found it convenient to have. So far I have been very happy with this purchase. My only complaint is that it took a while to arrive, about 3-4 weeks. If I had the chance I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Brush broke in first 3 uses</li>
    <li> Though you could also buy this in a Dollar General store, but in my case they don&#x27;t have in mine, it does the job. Makes easy production and clean up. Measurement are very helpful too. 😄👍</li>
    <li> 5 stars all the way. The brush is firm and direct.&lt;br /&gt;I spoon makes it easy for me to place my clay mask over my eyebrows without touching.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy for all my frineds!</li>
    <li> Very happy with this purchase. The reviews said it is small, which it is but for a face mask a small bowl is perfect. Very happy with the purchase and price.</li>
    <li> Good product, brush looked liked it was cut on the one end but otherwise I&#x27;m happy with it</li>
    <li> Smaller than expected . Did not come with blue brush but a pink brush . Look good can&#x27;t wait to try it,</li>
    <li> To a ling time to arrive, is very small and my applicator brush already broke.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so small it not even usable. She can&#x27;t mix n e thing in it as it&#x27;s too small. We are completely unhappy with this product</li>
    <li> I like this I use it every week for my faces masks</li>
    <li> This works well for mixing up the Aztec face mask without making a huge mess. I just measure equal parts clay and vinegar with the scoop, using the plastic stick to mix. This was well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Very cute neat and small. You have all you need for a perfect facial spa at home. Love it.</li>
    <li> This took about 2 months to come in the mail....It came in a nondescript envelope from China with Chinese writing on it. I was scared to open it since I totally forgotten I had ordered it with the Aztec Clay and Vinegar....I had no idea was the envelope contained. It certainly will serve the purpose of mixing up a facial but not worth the $ or the time you have to wait to get it.</li>
    <li> It makes me feel all right. Just kidding This is awesome. Would suggest to others for purchase. Fantastic consistent product.</li>
    <li> the shipping came so fast!&lt;br /&gt;i didn&#x27;t use it yet but i expected silicon but it looks plastic...&lt;br /&gt;other than that it is very nice compare to the price</li>
    <li> should mention it&#x27;s completely kid size. and should be less that a penny.</li>
    <li> 2 starts are for the measuring spoons (ha ha). Very cheaply made. Brush did not even glue to the wooden stick. Fail off first picked up. Stir stick is flimsy. Bowl is all scratched up because of cheap plastic. I use it to mix clay and water and ended up using my fingers. measuring spoons are just like any other one. I don&#x27;t even need it. If this one is a disposable set, it might be ok, but not a set where you would use over and over again... though the brush feel kind of nice and soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a couple months and it works perfectly for what I needed it for and just the right size.</li>
    <li> Worst product I have ever ordered on Amazon!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;It is not worth half the price.  It is cheap, like a toy for a kid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took 25+ days to arrive.  I would have been better off going down to the Dollar store and get something similar for less than $1!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I CAN&amp;#34;T BELIEVE A WAITED 3 WEEKS FOR THIS</li>
    <li> This took so long to ship if forgot I ordered it. It&#x27;s very small I was expecting the size of a cereal bowl and it is smaller than 1 cup. I suppose you dont need a huge bowl for masks but just not what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> This little kit is perfect. I used it with the Aztec Indian Clay and apple cider vinegar I just got and it was super easy to make the mask and mix and easy to clean up and the brush was perfect to apply. I was concerned it would be too flimsy and had bought an extra make up brush instead, but this works totally fine. If your looking for a DIY mask kit - I can&#x27;t imagine anything better.&lt;br /&gt;Note: This ships from Hong Kong though, which I didn&#x27;t know and was bummed when I saw the shipping estimate being 3-4 weeks, although it did arrive several weeks before their estimated arrival time, so in the end worked out totally fine.</li>
    <li> slow shipment.  International, so it is understandable.  But the product is not impressive.  By what i can see, i would have better get this at the .99cents store.  Poorly packaging.  The plastic package that it came with is staples all four sides and it got cut or break from shipment or someone else returned (I&#x27;m not sure) around the small tiny bowl, which leaved the scratch on the bowl and the brush head it looked like it is about to come off from the brush handle.  It looks more like a toy to me.</li>
    <li> Average, bowl is real small.</li>
    <li> I use this for at home masks. The brush fell apart right away but I love the rest of the kit. It does take a while to arrive.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty quality product! I got it for the mixing bowl, measuring cup, and plastic spatula. I didn&#x27;t give a hoot about the brush, but if you DO care about the brush: steer clear. When I received mine, it had already shedded about half the bristles in the packaging and was essentially unusable. I ended up pitching it. Shipping took a long time, but it came well packaged. I use it to mix up face masks and it serves its purpose very well!</li>
    <li> Had to wait a while for this product but it was worth it.</li>
    <li> a lot smaller than it looks and the brush is small and fell apart after using it 2 times</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great thing to have for mixing facial masks or hair masks.comes with a mixing spatula,measuring spoons and an application brush.</li>
    <li> This is perfect and exactly what I needed.  YES, it is small, but you don&#x27;t need a big bowl for a mask.  Plus for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it.  It also arrived very quick which was a pleasant surprise.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Cheap made ,but for the price is OK .fast shipping</li>
    <li> Definitely worth the price... Very cheap. Packaging was stapled together on one half, the other half was already opened. Just horrible</li>
    <li> Slow delivery and the brush is not what i was expecting. I will have to find a stiffer brush to spread my clay mask on with.  This brush may work better with a more liquid like mask.</li>
    <li> not has big as I expected but will do for my facial mixes!</li>
    <li> This item is perfectly fine for mixing my face masks . For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> By the time it got me it was in pieces. Many pieces. Not worth it.</li>
    <li> This is a childs toy!  JUNK!!!</li>
    <li> Good for its purpose. I use it for my at home facial mask. I loveeeee the brush. Nice and soft ,feels great on.skin and apply product evenly. Great price great product. The only down side is that it&#x27;s not the best plastic but like I said it serves its purpose</li>
    <li> The sizes are listed in the description, but the information is presented in a complicated way. When I ordered, the sizes in inches were not given. I took a gamble on this and lost. The bowl looks like it was made for a child to play with, way too small. The item obviously shipped from China and the packaging had Chinese writing on it, which made me think twice for obvious reasons.</li>
    <li> Came in a small package from what looked like a dollar store in China. I would not recommend anyone to order these.</li>
    <li> A nice small size, perfect to make enough mask for 1 or 2 people.</li>
    <li> So excited to use this for my facials</li>
    <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that my brush is pink tipped, (so if it being completely color coordinated is a deal breaker for you, I&#x27;d say pass) otherwise this is a perfect little set to use with my Aztec Secret clay masks. Having the brush to apply makes it less messy, too, which means I&#x27;ve been using my AS a bit more often. Took a while to come, there are sets that are prime eligible as well but the price was quite a bit higher.</li>
    <li> This item is not really good quality.</li>
    <li> Terrible product, brush was missing all the brissels and it&#x27;s made so terribly cheap.  Vender would not authorize refund and wanted me to take picture of brush due to not believing me.</li>
    <li> This item appeared larger in the photo on amazon but I bought it with 3 other items so did not investigate. It is very small and at first I was disappointed but it is actually an excellent size. I would recommend it but be prepared for a very small bowl</li>
    <li> Received a pink one, with a blue label, this oversight made me angry Not worth returning BUT I HATE PINK I&#x27;LL RESTATE THIS AGAIN, JUST BC THE LABEL SAYS BLUE, LOOK INSIDE THE DARN PACKAGE TO MAKE SURE THE PRODUCT IS WHAT IT SAYS IT IS.</li>
    <li> I do a lot of diy masks and this little package is great. I really liked it and for the price you can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> Order awhile ago from factory market, and I got to say they are awesome hence the four stars. Factory market went above and beyond the call of duty to satisfy a customer. The product came as describe. Happy.</li>
    <li> This item is perfectly fine for mixing my face masks. It is easy to clean. The price is just right.</li>
    <li> All of the utensils work well and are perfect for clay masks that can&#x27;t be in contact with anything containing metal (such as bentonite clays). The only thing is that I wish the bowl was a little bigger. It certainly does the trick for making facial masks, but I sometimes like doing body masks, which means that I have to make multiple &amp;#34;servings&amp;#34; in the bowl. It still works fine, just a little more inconvenient.</li>
    <li> Sorry I ordered it, the product is useless.</li>
    <li> I love the mask bowl now I can throw away other containers</li>
    <li> This is perfect for my Aztec clay facial mask, easy to clean and whatnot. It&#x27;s actually pretty small, but it doesn&#x27;t need to be any bigger. The tools are useful and also easy to clean, the brush hasn&#x27;t lost any bristles yet so I&#x27;m happy. It all came in a really cheap, ugly looking package that was stapled together, but it came from China so I&#x27;m not all that bothered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember, this is a cheap priduct. You get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> Quality product. use it for mixing and applying facial creams or masks. I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.  It&#x27;s inexpensive and will to the job if you&#x27;re looking for something similar.</li>
    <li> It is a lot smaller in real life...</li>
    <li> I disagree with the reviews that say it&#x27;s a waste of money. Honestly, you get what you pay for. If you&#x27;re using this to mix your facial masks then it&#x27;s a perfect inexpensive buy. if you&#x27;re buying this for it&#x27;s superiority in detail then forget about. It is what it is. It&#x27;s PERFECT for me. It&#x27;s a very simple product, a brush, measuring tools and bowl.</li>
    <li> Shipment came before the expect. Really cute product and cheap. I recommend</li>
    <li> Great product to use when mixing products that cannot be mixed in metal or with metal. A very sturdy set.</li>
    <li> They do what they are supposed to. If you are making a homemade face or hair mask (as opposed to mixing a store bought one) know that this is very tiny-  hands cupped together hold it completely. The brush is my favorite part.</li>
    <li> Not the best quality but it works</li>
    <li> Smaller than I thought. About the size of a 1/2 measuring cup. Works as needed though.</li>
    <li> Love it ... it looks just like I thought. . So I&#x27;m happy with it .. can b use for some many things...</li>
    <li> This is so cute! Love it for my clay mask.</li>
    <li> very small and cheap, but serves it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
    <li> It arrived wa after the products I ordered...which bummed me out. But the real shocker was the size of it. It looks like it was from my toddlers tea set.!?#! #!!</li>
    <li> For the price I loved it. Of course it&#x27;s cheap looking because it is cheap but with that being said the brush is soft the plastic is hard and durable.</li>
    <li> Easy to mix your DIY at home facials - love this.  It was so inexpensive and I use it for a make @ home facial  Easy to clean, comes with its own facial brush.  Definitely worth a purchase if you do a lot of at home - DIY facials.</li>
    <li> Love this item.  Is made in china, the brush is hollow.  But it is really cute.</li>
    <li> The brush fell apart the first day</li>
    <li> The bowl is perfect and pretty durable, as is the brush. These both also clean very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; and the &amp;#34;measuring spoons&amp;#34; have thin pieces of plastic left from being cast, which isn&#x27;t a big deal, but it can be hard to clean, and it catches on the sponges, and is tough on soft hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it&#x27;s exactly what I needed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping does take a while, but it was worth the wait for the convenience of doing your own facials more easily!</li>
    <li> The bowl could be bigger</li>
    <li> package was opened and half of the bristles on the brush were scattered within when i received it. for what i paid for this, i don&#x27;t really mind. it&#x27;s inexpensive and easy to use, and i&#x27;d give a higher rating, but the whole brush thing was kind of a bummer.</li>
    <li> I use this to make clay face masks. Small, but just the right size to make one mask...maybe holds a little more than a cupful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect anything fancy for the price. Though the brush is a bit sturdier than other people have commented. Even if it does fall apart, I could just pick up an e.l.f. brush for a dollar as a replacement.</li>
    <li> The product is extremely useless. Considering I ordered it January 10th and didn&#x27;t receive it til March 13th, and then the product is of poor quality (the brush head literally came off the 1st use), I would not recommend this for purchase. If you do, be prepared to use gorilla glue to prolong its function. I went back to tuperware, a paintbrush, plastic spoon, and tbs measure scoop..</li>
    <li> Love this little mixing bowl for my aztec healing clay masks! Super easy to use and clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty much a passive person, but this is extremely small. For me it is workable, I use it for facials and mixing a couple of times doesn&#x27;t really bother me. But I have bowls that belong to my toddler twice bigger than this</li>
    <li> I love it although it took more than 8 weeks to deliver, But I can&#x27;t complain since it was so cheap.</li>
    <li> Haven used it yet ready too though.. It&#x27;s just right for my farcical mask.</li>
    <li> This is everything to apply my Aztec Mud Masque with, you have to add apple cider vinegar for it to be effective, the paint brush is lovely, and makes the task easier!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this little bowl! It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for !!!! Great for mixing my weekly facial! THANKS!</li>
    <li> The bowl is about as big as a small teacup, the rest is just as useless...Do not buy! Avoid this!</li>
    <li> The bowl and everything is fine but why would it take a month to get here? I have purchased products overseas many times and it usually takes 2-3 weeks at most. Again the product itself is fine but the wait time is ridiculous. To their credit, the bowl made it within the estimated delivery time frame</li>
    <li> Not as big as I thought it would be but serves the purpose. There is nothing much left to say</li>
    <li> Broke after a week. cheap</li>
    <li> I use this set daily and it is a nice little set to use for skincare product mixing and facials. Tools are nice. This brush didn&#x27;t fall apart but the other one in pink did. Not sure why but it is  good set overall and the spatula and the brush are great for mixing and applying skin care masks. Long delivery wait time.</li>
    <li> Great for masks. Just really handy and easy to clean. I usually throw mine in the dishwasher. Great steal for the low price.</li>
    <li> Use it for other things</li>
    <li> Cheap had to ship from China, got it almost a month after order, the brush broke in 2 weeks of use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great combo with the right size. They make the mask time easy and less frustrating. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Nice set. Took forever to get to my door step.</li>
    <li> for the price I guess I shouldn&#x27;t expect too much. However, the day I received it, The brush was already broken from the handle. And that was really a bummer, I tried to make the best use of it, but it was annoying trying to apply my ask and getting dirty since the handle was no longer on the brush. I bought for that exact reason.</li>
    <li> Great little set for when your doing any type of facial mask. Took a very long time to arrive (2-3 months) but it was crazy cheap and worked for what I needed for my diy facials.</li>
    <li> Makes it so easy to mix, measure and apply any masks.</li>
    <li> I thought these bowls would be a little larger. The were the size of the inside of my palm. Took forever to come. I actually forgot I  bought it.</li>
    <li> This product is garbage. That is all. Getting what you paid for.</li>
    <li> This kit was exactly what I needed for my at-home facials.  The material makes is super easy to clean (most of the clay dried and fell off the second I scrubbed it).  For the price it is an excellent bowl/tool ensemble.</li>
    <li> This product was a little smaller than expected, but when mixing a mask, you don&#x27;t need a large bowl. It is still convenient. I bought this to mix and apply the Indians secret clay mask. The brush was a little cheaper, as was expected, but got the job done. For 3$, I&#x27;d recommend this to just make things a little easier.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great... all the tools I need to prepare a facial mask.  Especially loved that it came with measuring spoons.</li>
    <li> I received my order on time which was nice, but the brush was dirty!!! I&#x27;ve tried to clean it, but I think it&#x27;s stained. Good thing i only paid $5 for it... They best part about the purchase was the masque bowl. I&#x27;ve used it a couple times and I like it.</li>
    <li> Love this produce.  Just the right size.</li>
    <li> Not anything fancy but it serves its purpose and it was dirt cheap! It arrived timely and without incident so I would recommend</li>
    <li> this item is okay.  It is much smaller than I thought, but overall it is a nice small set for facials.</li>
    <li> This set is adorable. Took a while to get shipped. I almost forgot I ordered it till it came. No more bowls or Tupperware and teaspoons to mix my beauty masks and treatments. Before I got this set I was wasting so much product. U know u mix up ur mask and end up throwing some away because u over did it the amounts. The measuring spoons are perfect. You will find out just the amount u need for your mask. I use the spatchula to mix my clay mud masks and apply it too. The brush is better for smoother liquid treatments. Easy cleanup and cute to boot :) every lady should have this!</li>
    <li> Not what I thought it would be. The product is very small (child like).</li>
    <li> This is like a mini set of plastic.</li>
    <li> Great for applying my red mud mask.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s to small like it toy.</li>
    <li> Used it to mix that aztec secret clay mask stuff and was totallly great.</li>
    <li> Nice, inexpensive set to use for mixing your little beauty recipes. I like to keep separate tools for bathroom/beauty and kitchen/food.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s MUCH MUCH to small for anything really practical.</li>
    <li> MASK BOWL IS REALLY SMALL BUT GETS THE JOB DONE. TOOLS INSIDE OF BOWL REALLY USEFUL.</li>
    <li> For under $3, this is a great set. Works just as you would expect.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect little mask bowl. It&#x27;s the right size and good quality. Very cute!</li>
    <li> Very good price.  This is just plastic basic set, but it serves the purpose and the price it great!</li>
    <li> Great kit for making masks, cleans up easily and easy to store after use.</li>
    <li> Could be a little bigger but works good</li>
    <li> If you do clay masks at home, this set is very useful. However, the brush broke one week after purchase. I could not expect anything more for the price I paid.</li>
    <li> when i received this, i realized why it was so cheap. it is so tiny. it looks like a doll accessory</li>
    <li> Good size for when traveling</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for, I suppose, but this is a very simple and convenient alternative to using kitchen dishes to make poultices and beauty masks and such. The spatula is helpful as are the measuring spoons since a lot of natural products shouldn&#x27;t come in contact with metal. I keep my set in the bathroom and use it when I want to make a Bentonite Clay mask or Honey and Essential Oils mask and it&#x27;s very handy. Of course, clean it before use, but when I tried to clean the brush the brush part fell off the handle immediately. Easily fixable with some glue, but not really worth the effort. My bowl and tools were all blue, as shown, but my brush had pink bristles and a Silver colored metal over the white stick. And it took forever to get it, but I believe it ships from China so that is to be expected as well.</li>
    <li> Not that great. The brush is pretty awful. It was pretty cheap so not that concerned. I can still make use of the bowl in general. Kind of felt some kind of toy product. Like a toy bowl/spoon included in a kid&#x27;s toy kitchen set.</li>
    <li> it took forever to receive. works well for putting face masks on.</li>
    <li> The brush was broken when I got it but I put it back together. Other than that the product is nice and it&#x27;s cute. Perfect size for mixing face molds in.</li>
    <li> I bought this set primarily for the facial brush so that I can apply face masks evenly. I used it for a while in making the own masks and this set is perfect for that!</li>
    <li> Item was very small and it took a long time to receive it.</li>
    <li> lock big but it&#x27;is too small :(</li>
    <li> Item is wrong color. Title clearly says blue. it&#x27;s fine, I&#x27;m a girl so the pink color won&#x27;t be a huge issue, but still the title of the product should be changed. I pay $2 extra for the BLUE so it&#x27;s a little upsetting that that didn&#x27;t matter. Not sure if that&#x27;s the seller&#x27;s/packaging&#x27;s fault, but I&#x27;m including it in my review so other know that it can happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that the product works fine &#x3D;) Great for clay masks.</li>
    <li> It works great with the mud</li>
    <li> Plastic is thin and cheap.</li>
    <li> nice set. I use it for making home masks for my face</li>
    <li> It was much smaller than I expected.</li>
    <li> Perfect kit for applying clay masks. Perfect measurements, brush is quality soft bristels.</li>
    <li> Not sure how long the brush will last. Poor quality</li>
