    <li> My favorite hair spray</li>
    <li> Specifically bought this to go through airport security when travelling.  A very convenient size.  Also I find the hairspray works extremely well with a slight application.</li>
    <li> I keep one of these in my desk drawer at work in case I need some extra hold. It&#x27;s small and easy to carry around on the go, and the hold is pretty good. Just don&#x27;t expect it to hold up to anything too demanding.</li>
    <li> Great hold. Best hairspray for fine hair.</li>
    <li> Perfect for travel. Exactly what I need.</li>
    <li> Nice hairspray.  Not sticky and holds hair in place.  Nothing outstanding.</li>
    <li> Average product - extremely overpriced!</li>
    <li> Had to buy a travel size because I was flying to Boston.  So I thought I could get it cheaper on line.  Wrong.  Walmart has the same size for $1.00.  However, I did like the hairspray.  I would buy this brand again.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for at least ten years. This is a travel size that is perfect for purse or office desk drawer for quick touch ups.</li>
    <li> GOOD PRODUCT WILL ORDER AGAIN</li>
    <li> I ordered this small size because the spray is perfect.  I tossed out the larger size because the spray nozzle did not work well.</li>
    <li> [t was small..for the price</li>
    <li> I like this brand, it hold very well and this is a great travel size</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I has going on an overnight airplane trip. The 1.5 oz size allows it to be in carry-on luggage per the TSA. The produce itself is fine. I did misread the heading for the product and thought I was getting two of the containers. Actually, &amp;#34;Two&amp;#34; is part of the product description and not the quantity. Later I found the identical product at target for much less than I paid online.</li>
    <li> Wow I thought this was gonna be a regular size can of hair spray..nope. it&#x27;s travel size. It&#x27;s mini. Not worth the price. I&#x27;m very unhappy I can get a can at the store for same price and a lot more spray.</li>
