      <li>Wonderful!</li>
      <li>I have never used a product like this before, but I was very happy with the results.</li>
      <li>Excelent very good product.</li>
      <li>So off to the store I went to purchase 100% acetone remover which works great.</li>
      <li>Great concept but needs work.</li>
      <li>This worked great.  </li>
      <li>polish remover and the orange sticks were great.  </li>
      <li>Works great for shellac polish.  </li>
      <li>This product is high quality, the instructions are thorough, and the nail polish looks great!!</li>
      <li>I was apprehensive about buying the remover kit to save money - but the aluminum inserts makes it much more convenient than trying to soak cotton balls and wrapping foil around my fingers and toes.  </li>
      <li>This product is ok</li>
      <li>Thank you for such a wonderful product.</li>
      <li>Plastic would be better.</li>
      <li>I love this kit, Contains everything you need to remove your gel nail polish.</li>
      <li>I love having all the tools to do my nails from home.</li>
      <li>The foils are exactly what I wanted &#x3D; but getting 10 or 20 isnt a good deal.</li>
      <li>I received a red Carpet kit with the UV light for Christmas, was very impressed with the results and the ease of use.</li>
      <li>Makes take the gel off so easy.</li>
      <li>It was easy to use, and effective the first time around.</li>
      <li>The polish remover is great but not much of it.  </li>
      <li>Good kit - has all the items you need for proper removal.</li>
      <li>Makes removing gel nails easy and fast!</li>
      <li>I have tried a lot of other methods to removing gel nail polish and this one has worked the best for me.&lt;br /&gt;I liked it because there is no mess involved and the gel comes off almost completely.</li>
      <li>Great have been looking for something that takes off gel polish without a mess.</li>
      <li>I love shellac but don&#x27;t get manicure regularly</li>
      <li>Exactly what I order and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  </li>
      <li>I will probably buy more in the future, as they&#x27;re easier than cotton balls and foil from home!</li>
      <li>The aluminum foil sheets with the built in cotton patch are really functional and you can reuse them a couple of times before you need to replace them.</li>
      <li>Overall - a nice kit - though you could buy each items individually a bit cheaper.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>We were new to gel polish and a bit nervous.  </li>
      <li>This product line is simple to use and a very high quality product.</li>

<li> Then move to the other hand.  </li>
<li> I think it would be easier with a cooton ball and a square of foil you can ball tightly over it.</li>
<li> It is hard to get the foil to keep it on tight.</li>
<li> the removal is a small bottle as in the kit............</li>
<li> Stick with using acetone even if it harsher at least it works.</li>
<li> The print of the directions, however, so small that it was difficult to understand the directions for the use of the product.</li>
<li> Wood sticks are worthless in my opinion.  </li>

    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the quality of the product. I wont be recommending it. Also found similar and better in my local store at half the price.</li>
    <li> 3 star rating only because I didnt read box properly - not enough foils included.&lt;br /&gt;The polish remover and the orange sticks were great.  The foils are exactly what I wanted &#x3D; but getting 10 or 20 isnt a good deal.</li>
    <li> it is ok, but for the staff inside to expensive. the removal is a small bottle as in the kit............</li>
    <li> Good kit - has all the items you need for proper removal. The aluminum foil sheets with the built in cotton patch are really functional and you can reuse them a couple of times before you need to replace them.

    <li> Wonderful! This product is high quality, the instructions are thorough, and the nail polish looks great!!</li>
    <li> This kit works just like the products that are used at a nail salon, but I can remove my polish at home, which saves me time and money.</li>
    <li> Thank you for such a wonderful product. We were new to gel polish and a bit nervous.  This product line is simple to use and a very high quality product. I will be using Red Carpet products for a long time.</li>
    <li> Used as directed, but didn&#x27;t take off gel polish. Stick with using acetone even if it harsher at least it works.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this. The soaked padding needs to be pressed on to the nail. It is hard to get the foil to keep it on tight. I think it would be easier with a cooton ball and a square of foil you can ball tightly over it. Great concept but needs work.</li>
    <li> I have never used a product like this before, but I was very happy with the results. It was easy to use, and effective the first time around.</li>
    <li> My husband got this for me for Christmas, but I think you can remove the gel polish with regular acetone and I have never used the foils.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I order and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  I love having all the tools to do my nails from home.</li>
    <li> What can I say!  This product is ok and I wouldn&#x27;t order it again.  The polish remover is great but not much of it.  So off to the store I went to purchase 100% acetone remover which works great.</li>
    <li> Works great for shellac polish.  I love shellac but don&#x27;t get manicure regularly so I like the option of taking it off at home.  This worked great.  I would do one hand at a time.  Then move to the other hand.  The hardest part is getting the foil to stay on your finger.  I left it on for a while and the nail polish peeled off with a cuticle pushers help.</li>
    <li> The solution and wraps don&#x27;t actually work in the time frame designated on the box.  It takes longer and it doesn&#x27;t just slide off without scraping!</li>
    <li> Excelent very good product. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great have been looking for something that takes off gel polish without a mess.</li>
    <li> I received a red Carpet kit with the UV light for Christmas, was very impressed with the results and the ease of use. So I just had to purchase the removal kit. Makes take the gel off so easy.</li>

    <li> I love this kit, Contains everything you need to remove your gel nail polish.</li>
    <li> Makes removing gel nails easy and fast! Very simple process! I will probably buy more in the future, as they&#x27;re easier than cotton balls and foil from home!</li>
