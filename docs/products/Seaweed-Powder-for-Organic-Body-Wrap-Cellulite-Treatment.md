      <li>Here comes the amazing part,</li>
      <li>Amazing product.  </li>
      <li>But that one time was amazing.  </li>
      <li>I used the recipe on the jar as a guideline and created my own face mask mixture using the seaweed powder, sea salt, olive oil, and water.  </li>
      <li>The smell is kind of fishy but keep in mind</li>
      <li>Washed off with ease and had nice glowing skin.</li>
      <li>also used it on my face twice and already see a nice difference.  </li>
      <li>This product is awesome it really does work it takes off</li>
      <li>Vet nice product.</li>
      <li>I am honest</li>
      <li>This is the absolute best for cellulite</li>
      <li>Excellent product, arrived very promptly</li>
      <li>Really felt wonderful afterwards.</li>
      <li>Nice to use as a bath soak.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I wish I could have liked it, but between the nauseating smell and the stain in the tub, I&#x27;m going to have to stop using it.</li>
      <li>All reviews are 100% my own opinion</li>
      <li>Love this powder it works great for the skin helps reduce the appearance in cellulite and is a lot more affordable then going to the salon</li>
      <li>I am really loving this product!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I think you can get creative and mix it up with just about anything that is good for the skin and make a paste out of it....</li>
      <li>I liked the email that i got from them about all the recipes i can do with it.</li>
      <li>To get the kind of &amp;#34;paste&amp;#34; that I was looking for, I also end up adding some water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I liked both recipes.</li>
      <li>It is cost effective to do my spa at home myself than pay to do it.</li>
      <li>It takes a very long warm shower with your best body washer and a very nice body lotion or oil to cover the fishy smell.</li>
      <li>Smell is very very strong .</li>
      <li>I love it; the smell is very strong</li>
      <li>I have not been given any free order for a true review I have not even contacted comp they sent a welcome n some ways to use seaweed mixture.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It arrived quick! Its messy and i did not lose a inch</li>
    <li> Yes this product does help with inflammation of the skin.  Thus, it makes the appearance of skin look nicer.  However, it can be drying if used daily.  Without daily use the effect on the skin is lost.  Too, it is smelly and, messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have taken baths with the powder and, my skin did look great.  Yet, as a cure for cellulite?  No.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, use on special occasions to pamper yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will mainly finish my jar doing facials every so often.  The baths smell up the bathroom for days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I doubt I will reorder this product.</li>
    <li> Exactly what it says it is.</li>
    <li> love, use on hair and skin</li>
    <li> Only use this once but I love it. My skin appeared to be brighter and smoother. The next morning I didn&#x27;t want to use my regular face cleanser.</li>
    <li> Work like it is supposed to. The seaweed has helped in my weight loss by getting rid of cellulite. Received the product at a decent time.  Would by again and suggest the seaweed.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing for your skin and hair, however is smells awful! It&#x27;s a catch 22 because the results are great, but then you smell like rotting fish and seaweed.&lt;br /&gt;I honestly can&#x27;t decide if the results are worth it.  I think I&#x27;ll try using it with strong smelling essential oils to see if that helps at all.</li>
    <li> Used this product for over a month every day, super messy. Didn&#x27;t see any results in reducing my cellulite. I followed directions in full and even added in the expensive clay. No reesults. I will not try again</li>
    <li> I have been using this seaweed powder mixed with olive oil to create a face mask. It leaves my skin super soft and radiant. I have tried it twice as an aid for cellulite in the thigh area, but I just couldn&#x27;t get past the mess that it makes in the shower, it may work but I&#x27;ll never know. Overall, great product that I use as a mask twice a week.</li>
    <li> Follow the instructions. Buy bentonite clay add it with this, olive oil and salt. Don&#x27;t forget to pick up essential oil.  I have a serious spine issue. I&#x27;ve not been able to exercise hardly at all. There have been extended amounts of times in bed. I have a LOT of cellulite on my leg.  I followed the reciepe and wrapped. Durning this time I prepared my hair dye and colored my hair. After about 30 minutes I used the remaining leftovers in my metal bowl and scrapped them in a hot bath.  With the Saran Wrap still on I hopped into a very hot bath and soaked. After 10 more minutes I began peeling the Saran Wrap and scrubbing off the rest of the clay.  It was instant. Less cellulite. Amazing product.  I&#x27;m stunned, now what to do with all that high priced product I&#x27;ve tried from bliss, clarins and nuxe????</li>
    <li> I really like this product after one time my skin looked better. The only problem is I bought it to use on my face but I can&#x27;t get past the smell. I know its seaweed and is supposed to smell that way but I can&#x27;t get past it. Straight up fish smell. I&#x27;ll use it on my body but not on my face.</li>
    <li> Love it. I&#x27;m wrapped up now!  Some people have complaints about the smell. I put doterra geranium oil in, and it smells fabulous. It&#x27;s also fantastic for skin, so........win, win!  Enjoy.</li>
    <li> too messy, clumps, makes a HUGE mess.. didnt see a differnece</li>
    <li> Thank you for this product. It is truly everything I wanted. I created a body scrub with it. Anyone who is on the fence about this product, please take advice from me and purchase it. Very fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I was surprised how well this product work for me , everything they claim is true! I would recommend it to anyone looking to help improve their skin issues.</li>
    <li> At first I was frustrated bc I only mixed it with water and it was so clumpy and falling everywhere.  Then, I did some reading and mixed it with olive oil and sea salt and it&#x27;s wonderful.  You can make it to whatever your desired consistency is.  It is a little messy so I suggest doing in in the shower and having some old rags to wipe your hands on after rinsing.  Also, if you have some sort of workout belt or something to put on top of plastic, it makes it feel like it stays in place better.  I haven&#x27;t been consistent about using it so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s helping, but my skin feels awesome after.  Great price for the amount you get also!</li>
    <li> Way bigger than I thought, which is amazing! It came in about two days and the first thing I did was use it as a face mask with the seaweed powder, olive oil, vitamin C serum and essential oil lemongrass. I left the mask on for one hour. I won&#x27;t lie, it does get a little messy. Mixing it was fine and clean but once you apply it, it tends to drip everywhere until it actually dries which takes a while. But the clean up wasn&#x27;t bad so I can&#x27;t complain. Here comes the amazing part, when I took the mask of my skin was so soft, softer than it had ever been. My blemishes didn&#x27;t just immediately disappear but they were less red and noticeable. I also applied the mask on my neck which made ir super soft as well. The next day I did a belly wrap with the same concoction and I wrapped it in seran wrap and left it on for an hour as well. I can&#x27;t say I saw any major weight loss differences in my stomach but my skin was smooth and brighter and softer! I love this stuff! There&#x27;s so much too it will last me forever! Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> This is definitely a high quality product.  While I do not enjoy the &amp;#34;fishy smell&amp;#34;, I suspect it is caused by the high grade of seaweed that is used.</li>
    <li> I was very excited waiting for my delivery and has it has arrived earlier than expected.&lt;br /&gt;The powder smells awful but I usually always add either peppermint or orange essential oil, which makes it better.  I have been using it for 3 weeks and have applied every 3rd day. The tights looking much better, but the cellulite is not completely gone. So I will continue using it and doing sport for the best results.</li>
    <li> Love this product....</li>
    <li> Works well and doesn&#x27;t dry out my flab!! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this as a face mask. Leaves my skin so soft and glowing. Slight tightening a plus!</li>
    <li> I love it not only dose it reduce the appearance of cellulite, it also makes my skin smooth and soft. I mix it with lavender or jazmen to hid the sea like scent.</li>
    <li> Smells really bad! Have only used once- it creates a horrible smell!</li>
    <li> Smells really bad and doesn&#x27;t to help cellulite even after using 5 days a week for a month</li>
    <li> am returning it back on 6/9/15 and should be on his way back to ur company, thank you, is not what I was looking for, anabell lemus</li>
    <li> Use this seaweed to make body scrub. Works wonders and leaves my skin glowing and smooth. I&#x27;ve ordered this a few times and always arrives quickly with no problems.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product twice on my face and also did a wrap on my lower body. Right after doing it the first time I went to get my haircut and my stylist said my skin looked \\&quot;luminous\\&quot;.  I&#x27;ve been going to her for almost 20 years... this was a new compliment!! I really like the product and I&#x27;m really curious to see what it does to my body twice a week after 2+ months!  I paid $25.00 (shipped) and although I&#x27;m obviously fine with that I do think that the price is a little steep.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been able to use it once so far.  But that one time was amazing.  I applied to my stomach and my skin is firmer and less flabby already.  I mixed it too thick so I will have to pay attention to mixing it next time.</li>
    <li> Horrible smell. Used for a month and no changes.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like because of the SMELL!</li>
    <li> This stuff is like magic!  I have been using it everyday, I mix  3 tablespoons of seaweed, 1/4 cup olive, 1/4 cup course sea salt and five drops of lemongrass oil in a wide jar.  Before taking a bath or shower I spread the mix in a circular motion almost like a message on my legs or anywhere you have cellulite.  I leave it on for three to five minutes,longer is better.  When rinsing off I slowing splash water and massage it vigorously into my skin.  My cellulite is disappearing it&#x27;s amazing.  I had little cellulite saddlebags, their gone that&#x27;s how I know this stuff works.  I still have some cellulite on my legs but I notice everyday I have less and less the more you use it the more the cellulite disappears.  I thought I could never get rid of it, thank God for seaweed!  I highly recommend this product, the seller is great I received my product in a timely fashion and the product delivered what it says it does.  Goodbye cellulite welcome great looking legs.</li>
    <li> This is the only thing that will literally erase my eczema! I usually mix it with tepid water and then slather it on wherever I need it, then I actually wrap the area with seran wrap and let it sit for about 45 minutes…works beautifully! Love this product, it is definitely true to its description!</li>
    <li> This is my go to powder to get rid of bumps, dirt and oil on my face. I use it mainly as a mask, but I&#x27;ve also mixed it with Noxzema as a quick facial wash. I don&#x27;t mind the smell as much because the results are phenomenal. I&#x27;ve mixed it with a few drops of apple cider vinegar or Listerine and it&#x27;s still amazing. I haven&#x27;t tried it for cellulite yet, but I plan to in the future. It&#x27;s not messy if you use a scooper and keep a plastic knife on hand for mixing. This jar will last a lifetime providing great results.</li>
    <li> This may work great, but it&#x27;s ridiculously messy. Too difficult/messy to use and make. No bueno for me.</li>
    <li> too messy and smells bad</li>
    <li> This is by far the best stuff and the only product to get rid of my cellulite. I have tried everything even vela shape..After 2 treatments I saw results..I have done 5 treatments now &amp; my cellulite is no longer noticeable, I use the scrub with the ingredients suggested..and wrap with plastic for 20-30 minutes. I will also continue using it to maintain and keep my skin smooth..Extremely pleased &amp; highly recommended…To the company my sincere gratitude for providing such a great product at an affordable cost.</li>
    <li> It is a very good product. It is comfortable to put it on my body. I got a result through 5 times. My skin is tighter, and the volume decreased by 1.5-2 cm.If you like it then you wrap fit</li>
    <li> ***good luck with their website, it&#x27;s technically non-existent because it provides zero info, looks like a scam to me - bellavoeux dot com - it doesn&#x27;t have any products listed, just a list of random fancy words like prada boots sunglasses paris etc....please do your research before buying, google it...seems like the company was created right after the Dr. Oz show in a midst of all the hype , a little fishy...In addition, when I bought it in May the price was $19, now it&#x27;s almost $30, what&#x27;s the reason??? the hype? I doubt it&#x27;s organic, it might make your skin smooth, but so will any seaweed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just started using it (used twice), so can&#x27;t really tell if it works yet. But, I have tried other seaweed masks before and I just wanted to write something as a comparison.&lt;br /&gt;My first try:  First of, the smell is disgusting. I first tried to make a body wrap by the recipe I found online: seaweed powder, oil (I used jojoba), essential oil and WATER. When I mixed  the powder and the oil, the texture was pretty nice, very creamy. I decided to forgo the water, applied it to my leg and wrapped with plastic wrap. No problem there... Nevertheless , I then decided to  follow the recipe anyway (to get more of the product) and added water to the paste I already made. OMG...The texture immediately turned into chunks and it started to smell so bad, to the point that I almost threw up. When applied it to my other leg, it was not sticking to the skin and was falling down (as one other reviewer described). When I later got into the shower to rinse it off, the mud that was nice and creamy (on one of my legs) turned into chunky texture with horrible smell once it got mixed with water from the shower. The whole shower bottom was full of smelly chunks, not sure it it&#x27;s good for the drain :-(. So, at this point I am not sure whether I got a bad batch or THIS particular powder SHOULDN&#x27;T be mixed with water.I wish I took pics, before and after I added water , maybe i&#x27;ll do that just to prove my point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My second try: This time I did some research and I see a lot of recipes saying to mix it with water only. So this is what I did. I left out the oil and just mixed the powder with water. Immediately the smell was apparent, but I kept on mixing it to get to a good consistency and give it another shot. Just like the first time, it happened again. The texture was chunky, not creamy at all. I firmly believe that this product is best when mixed with oil ONLY. So I still applied it to my legs, wrapped it and now sitting and waiting to rinse it off. The smell is bad, I can smell it through the plastic wrap and the sweatpants. I don&#x27;t mind any of the natural smells, as long as the texture is nice and creamy and it works. So far, it&#x27;s none of the above, unless I only mix it with oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the bottom line is - if I don&#x27;t get any solution from the company - i will mix it with oil ONLY (no water, even though I would still have to take if off in the shower and the whole chunky stuff will be on my shower floor no matter what) or I have to return it and try other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** Trying to do the scrub by suggestions of other reviewers, however, the smell is really bad and the texture of the scrub is not even near how the scrub should feel. I am returning the product and going back to using the mud I had previously used and which actually gave me good results (it&#x27;s expensive, therefore I was looking for a cheaper alternative, I guess you get what you pay for)</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! Not only does it come with a lot but you can see a difference in the skin for the first time! I love it; the smell is very strong but you get used to it. I use kt for body wraps; I add olive oil and tea tree oil and then apply it on!</li>
    <li> There were no instructions or ingredients listed. The company emailed me to advise they accidentally  forget the instructions and offered me 10 percent off my next purchase, however did not send the instructions after I requested that they do so.  After this, the company started calling me to purchase more seaweed powder. I did not give them permission to call me about making another purchase. I can not even use what I have, due to the lack of info.</li>
    <li> I made a cellulite scrub and have only been using it for less than a week, so I haven&#x27;t gotten results yet, but I am hopeful that this scrub will lessen my cellulite.</li>
    <li> It does make the skin smooth, the mixture is pretty messy though. I mixed mine with olive oil, sea salt &amp; lemongrass oil to make it smell good. But looks like it will work with consistent use</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any results yet, I don&#x27;t use it everyday, but I do use it a lot. Another thing is that when you try to apply it to your skin, it constantly keep falling off, so you definitely has to do it in the tub. I am gonna use the entire product til its all gone, and hopefully by then I can at least see some results.</li>
    <li> I had read about many of the seaweed powder reviews, many had talked about the odor, this one is mild to my nose.  I had mixed it with a coconut concoction the next time I  will mix with Aloe Vera.  I&#x27;ve only used it once so far so,  it made my skin was really soft,  but I&#x27;m still dimpled.</li>
    <li> Can tell you to buy I just started using it, the size of the jar is big, and I just started using it can tell you to buy it until another week I will tell you how good it is</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this several times over the past two weeks, and feel like it is helping tone down the dreaded cellulite.  I mixed the recommended receipe of Seaweed Power, Sea Salt, carrier Oil (I use more than just Olive Oil) and some essential oils (including the recommended lemon grass).  To get the kind of &amp;#34;paste&amp;#34; that I was looking for, I also end up adding some water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My process is to first dry brush my legs, then massage this concoction into my thighs, then wrap in plastic wrap (starting at the knee on the left, up, around the buttocks to anchor the wrap, and down the left leg to the knee).  Then, because I have them, I wrap over that with stretchy leg wraps.  (I really want to get some sort of compression shorts that would be easier to slide over everything and hold it in place.)  Then I pull on my sweats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some info I read states you can just &amp;#34;relax for a half hour&amp;#34; and let the seaweed do it&#x27;s magic.  I use that time to get on the treadmill or exercise bike to really get those thigh muscles going and build a little heat.  I feel like exercise is a big component that we all hate to do, but it tones the underlying muscles along with burning some of the extra fat.  After working out, I remove the wrap, hop into a shower and scrub off the seaweed paste (which is, as others have mentioned, a bit stinky even with the added oils... but the smell goes away after showering).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m seeing results.  It&#x27;s isn&#x27;t overnight, but it is working.  And I think that the seaweed wraps are helping move things along.</li>
    <li> Vet nice product. It got rid of most of my cellulite after one treatment paired with a half an hour in an infrared sauna. I&#x27;m still in shock.</li>
    <li> I use this to mix a couple of different skin care treatments. I like this powder and I like using seaweed. This is very good quality, good texture. There is a very strong smell with seaweed that lingers--it smells like it is straight from the ocean. Takes a while to get used to--essential oils help.</li>
    <li> Have used product a few times so far &amp; skin is definitely smoother &amp; softer with a more tone appearance.</li>
    <li> Messy and hard to mix and smells bad, but it makes your skin super smooth and i believe it did tighen up my skin a bit. So I can dig it, something new to try and way less expensive.</li>
    <li> Attempted to use it as a mask and a wrap. It made me itch, and left residue. It stains your clothing, so make sure you use old clothes/ rags.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything to improve the look of my thighs as I age and nothing seems to work. After only 3 uses, once every other day, I&#x27;m very encouraged. This might just be the thing that takes care of the cellulite on my thighs.&lt;br /&gt;**I&#x27;ve used this 2 times as a mud pack: once with coconut oil and apple cider vinegar, and once with olive oil and water. I liked both recipes. It&#x27;s very thick and a bit hard to rub on: it didn&#x27;t want to stick until I really diluted it with more liquid.&lt;br /&gt;**I&#x27;ve used it once in a hot bath. I think I prefer the hot bath and will probably stick with that method. The mudpack might work better as its more direct and potent, but in experimenting I&#x27;ve learned a few things......WARNING: Do not use as a mudpack on a white bathroom rug!!!!  I found that when its smeared on like thick mud, it has a tendency for little pieces to flake off as it dries, and get all over the bathroom floor. It&#x27;s messy. Plus I don&#x27;t like standing around for 30-45 minutes waiting for it to dry. It was much nicer to sit in a hot tub with 1/2 cup of Seaweed Powder in it for an hour with a good book and a tall glass of ice water, followed by a short shower to rinse clean. (I find that I get thirsty when using it so drink plenty of water during and after.) I&#x27;m using this product in conjunction with the Cellulite Massager Brush in the shower when I&#x27;m washing the treatment off.&lt;br /&gt;The value and price of this product is excellent - the jar is so big it surprised me. I like that its an Amazon Prime product and came in 2 days. Some people complained about the smell but I don&#x27;t mind it as it smells like the ocean to me, and its not that strong. All in all its a healthy all natural product and definitely worth trying to see if it works on &amp;#34;uniquely you&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t come with directions first of all. The jar is huge and i guess I got what I paid for. When I mixed it with water it didn&#x27;t mix well and created clumps, so i feel that I waited my money.</li>
    <li> I really works on all parts of your body.  I started to use it around my thights, now I included my neck, feet, underarms, buttock, any other parts of my body.  I am using the formula, i.e. 1/4 cup ea of olive oil, sea salt, 3 tbsps of seaweeds, and essential oil.  I use this one hour before going to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff, I even enjoy the smell..kind of beachy.  Soo, I&#x27;ve found that it works best as a scrub and if you use it everyday.  Obviously you won&#x27;t see results right away.  I mostly use it on the back of my thighs which is my biggest trouble spot.  I use 1/4 C sea salt, 1/4 cup grape seed or coconut oil and 3ish TBS to get a good scrub.  If you add lemongrass oil to the mix it smells wonderful! It makes my skin soo soft and has definitely helped the appearance of cellulite.</li>
    <li> hard to mix, smells horrible, but i did see a difference in skin, i wish it was already in a wrap</li>
    <li> I received my seaweed  wrap from amazon. Unfortunately there were no instructions.  I was able to research how to use the product.  I have only used it once so far and it was very messy but my skin did feel really good after using it.  I will try the process again in a few days.</li>
    <li> I love how this makes my skin feel! My skin feels so soft. I use it on my face and all over as a body wrap.</li>
    <li> I was amaze with the big tub it came in. Great smell. It is cost effective to do my spa at home myself than pay to do it. I began using it 2 weeks and it has my skin feeling silky. Friends who meet me said my skin has a healthy glow. I just smile because I feel good. I will continue to use it twice per week and buy more of it. Great job, keep it up.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!!! I have been using it on my face and legs with unbelievable results. It really works!! One treatment and you see the difference. It&#x27;s a must try and see the results for yourself!!!</li>
    <li> Makes my skin so soft and I actually saw improvement with dimpling after one application.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Excellent product one of the best at awesome price I tried other products the quality of this and the quantity are a great buy</li>
    <li> Yes, I would recommend this product.It does work and I&#x27;ve seen results in three weeks. I&#x27;ve been using it twice a week.</li>
    <li> Not sure what I am doing wrong used this a a cellulite fixer and after two months of mess no success will try to incorporate something else out of it</li>
    <li> Mixes easily and gives great results!</li>
    <li> It is really the Olive Oil that I mixed with it that I don&#x27;t like too well.  I suppose this is OK, but I don&#x27;t believe that it is changing any cellulite.  Maybe it will just take longer.</li>
    <li> Omg.. I love this product... I have been using this product for th three months and the results are amazing!!! My skin is soo soft and smooth and the cellulite is starting to smoothen out. The smell is kind of fishy but keep in mind it&#x27;s seaweed😊 I used it as a  body wrap and sometimes as a topical application and let it dry for 15 minutes then shower. The jar is huge so this is way worth buying.  Product recommended</li>
    <li> I like the amount and mixing condensity. The main concern I have is there was NO safety seal on this tube. I feel hesitant about using. It smells like seaweed but not sure why there would be no seal. Will need to contact customer service and hope for a replacement.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen improvement. The lemongrass does make it smell great. I&#x27;ve been using the Dr. Oz formula.</li>
    <li> I am extremely pleased with the customer service, as well as the product in general. Will continue to use the seaweed powder indefinitely.</li>
    <li> Smell is very very strong . Get ready . but I like how skin feel and I think that iodine in the powder sinking  through my skin giving me more energy next few days . also I use it for face and  i see how happy and tighter skin is . I do once a week.</li>
    <li> Did absolutely nothing for me! Did some more research only to find that squats and lunges DOES combat cellulite. Therefore, I have been hitting the gym and I am certainly noticing the results! (I have also heard the a rebounder and working out on a vibrating machine also combats cellulite the most)</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Arrived earlier than expected. Noticed a difference in  my skin, feels really soft. Got pass the smell, but overall product is great😀.</li>
    <li> I think it may work, it is just soooo messy.  It smells fishy too.  Some people may be okay with that though.</li>
    <li> Received very quickly and haven&#x27;t been able to use it yet.  It looks very interesting and I look forward to starting</li>
    <li> Crazy fast delivery!!!used it first time today,omg I don&#x27;t believe in anything until I c it myself,so I followed the body wrap instructions n had all the stuff at home ,kept it on for one hour, itsa miracle!!! im so happy it does work!!!of course it didn&#x27;t erase all the cellulite,but I c such a huge improvement ,skin looks very smooth n silky,will keep u updated ina few weeks,thanks to mother nature n ppl who knows how to use it :-)</li>
    <li> I used the recipe on the jar as a guideline and created my own face mask mixture using the seaweed powder, sea salt, olive oil, and water.  I applied to my face and let it do its magic.  Made my skin feel alive and smooth.  Definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> All I can say is that this product is expensive and it is too early for me to tell if it truly works as a cellulite reducer. What I can say is that it works perfectly with the Dr. Oz cellulite formula (lemongrass essential oil, powder, sea salt and olive oil). After this initial investment in the seaweed powder, I can make this scrub at home for virtually nothing for a very long time - so I consider this a good investment. Using the scrub twice has made my legs softer than they have been in years. I also like knowing that I can make batches of this product at home without adding all of the chemicals to keep it preserved. I like how natural and how soft this makes me feel.</li>
    <li> I heard it&#x27;s excellent if only I could open it. I will keep trying, or can you replace it. Thanks</li>
    <li> I had written before that it came in a small bag......I had the wrong item!&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff....came on time....came as advertised....and works beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;I use it as a face mask and body scrub. I also use it as a seaweed wrap.&lt;br /&gt;It works just like the spa wraps I have gotten....</li>
    <li> Works really well on smoothing out the skin. i have also used it as a mask. Really smells like the beach</li>
    <li> It smells really bad and hasn&#x27;t helped with my cellulite at all yet. I&#x27;ve used it for seven days so far and am starting to wonder if it&#x27;s worth the mess it makes in the shower.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous product! I use it as a body wrap for detox and weight loss. I mix it with bentonite clay and some sea salt and spring water. The smell of the &#x27;sea&#x27; is very strong, so I put Doterra essential oils (cypress and grapefruit, about 30 drops each) for aromatherapy and added skin improving benefits. My skin is smoother and softer and younger looking after even 1 treatment. Most people are iodine deficient and this is a great way to &#x27;feed&#x27; the body essential nutrients!</li>
    <li> i got the seaweed and i will try this weekend it s fishy of curse but let see if with the combination that Dr Oz say will work</li>
    <li> I use this as both a face mask and I use it for body wraps too.  I haven&#x27;t used this product long enough to say that it does remove any cellulite, but I can say that it leaves the skin soft and glowing.</li>
    <li> Its a good product, but still I don&#x27;t know how long to leave it on, or if putting it on overnight will help it work better. My big complaint is you have to upload something in order to view your webpage, I have a new computer and I don&#x27;t want a lot of junk built up on it, perhaps you could send me a link directly to your site. Hopefully there I;ll find more answers. I do think I should have gotten written directions along with the product. I&#x27;ve used it sever times and want to use it more, so if you have more info to give me, it would be appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deirdre</li>
    <li> Great product. I noticed results after the first application!</li>
    <li> This is also good for your skin, and it&#x27;s  done a good job. I would recommend it.&lt;br /&gt; For people that have alot of Fat they want to get rid off.</li>
    <li> Seller shipped product very very fast.  However, the product itself does not have a pleasant odor.  I am using it for a home remedy of cellulite reducer.  Mix it with lots of lemon essence oil; no other scent recommended.  Product is okay.</li>
    <li> It smells pure!! and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> Prob works great I just can&#x27;t get over the smell :(</li>
    <li> I have used this as a wrap a few times now and already see a difference in my skins appearance. I will definitely be buying more in the future. I am going to try some of the different recipes and see how they work also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item for free or at a discount for testing and review purposes. All reviews are 100% my own opinion</li>
    <li> I am really loving this product!&lt;br /&gt;I have never been much of a believer in body wraps, but after reading about the many benefits of seaweed, I decided to give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;The container is much larger than it appears in the picture, so I definitely feel like I have gotten great value for the money.&lt;br /&gt;I mixed this with some green clay , sea salt and olive oil and applied to my upper arms.&lt;br /&gt;I did dry brush the skin first.&lt;br /&gt;I then wrapped my arms in plastic , and let it sit for 1 hour.&lt;br /&gt;I rinsed it off, and was shocked at how soft and smooth my arms were. I also measured my arms before applying, and found that I lost 1/4&amp;#34; in both of my upper arms!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had read about the strong smell of the product, but I honestly didn&#x27;t find it to be too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried this as a mask this morning, and found that it left my face and neck looking firmer and smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome product!</li>
    <li> If you can get past the smell (strong seaweed odar) it&#x27;s very good.</li>
    <li> THis is a great product. Will definetly recommend! I have seen results and will continue to use it. I heard about this product on the Doctor Oz show. Looking forward to wear my Skorts this summer.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, mix it with the suggested ingredients, ms she it into skin and by some warps and warp the heck out of yourself, leave in place for s long s ou can tolerate, the longer the better and vwala your cellulite begins to diminish over time. Took. Couple of months of vigorous use but they actually do work and I am extremely happy with my results.</li>
    <li> Works great especially when mixed with Indian clay and raw apple cider vinegar for a mask. Leaves skin very smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> Great product used it as a facial mask left my skin feeling very clean and soft. I noticed my pores were smaller which is a plus  I would recommend it to any one whose interested in this product</li>
    <li> Wow wish it had bigger container, so nice and makes reall easy to work with, very fine poweder, Can&#x27;t belive its almost gone the best for the body wraps</li>
    <li> It was hard to get the right consistency and made a mess all over my shower. I didn&#x27;t really see any results.</li>
    <li> The product is of good quality, but the recipes for the cellulite wraps are an absolute disaster.  Very messy.  Won&#x27;t be doing those again until they come up with better advise on wraps!</li>
    <li> Very smelly and grainy.  Not at all what I expected.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I make a body wrap of it and in just two uses I notice a difference in the cellulite on my legs. It does smell horrible but what do you expect from seaweed?</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great I have only used it for two days and I already see the difference, I combine it with olive oil, sea salt and essential oil before I shower and massage it. It makes your skin very smooth!</li>
    <li> LOVE it! Received product as expected. I&#x27;ve use it as wrap solution on my legs. Really felt wonderful afterwards. Silky smooth.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, but does not take the place of diet &amp; exercise.  Product works great!</li>
    <li> I only tried once since the seaweed stained the bathtub and spent hours trying to get the greenish color out. Afraid to try again for this reason.</li>
    <li> This is the absolute best for cellulite and I have tried a lot of things! I&#x27;ve done three 30 minutes body wrap treatments and my cellulite is 95% gone. Can&#x27;t wait to do more! Use it as a mask too, made my skin feel wonderful.</li>
    <li> It gave me rash all over my body, so I only used it once, maybe it wasn&#x27;t for me since I have sensitive skin :(</li>
    <li> I am so glad I tried this seaweed powder!  It came as advertised and was a nice big container.  I have tried so many things over the years for cellulite and none worked until now.  I used it as directed on my legs a handful of times and can already tell a difference.  I had such a cottage cheese look that has now firmed up, a big difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used it on my face twice and already see a nice difference.  It is firmer, healthier, just a big difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this BellaVoeux Seaweed Powder - what an awesome find!!!</li>
    <li> Love the texture of skin after a wrap or face treatment with it, but the smell is awful.  But awfully natural from seaweed.  It takes a very long warm shower with your best body washer and a very nice body lotion or oil to cover the fishy smell. But results are great</li>
    <li> I will know within 30 days, if the product is productive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m making body scrubs and facial masques with this and I am truly impressed.  I&#x27;m my own guinea pig, and my first facial was amazing.  Thanks for making this product so available.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product to try a cellulite wrap but changed to a skin scrub for cellulite instead after watching Dr, Oz.  I have only used it for four days but I can already see a difference and my skin is amazingly soft.  I go ahead and use it one my feet as well and get the same results- smooth soft skin.  The recipe I used is 1/4 cup olive oil, 1/4 cup kosher or sea salt and 3 Tablespoons Seaweed Powder- mixed together.  I am anxious to check out their web site for more options.</li>
    <li> You can use this for pretty much EVERYTHING skin related...</li>
    <li> I DON&#x27;T BELIEVE FOR A SECOND THAT THIS HAS HELPED CELLULITE IN ANY WAY WHAT SO EVER BUT IT HAS MADE MY SKIN SOOOO SOFT. I AM AN EX SMOKER AND THE THINGS THIS STUFF HAS DONE TO HELP MY FACE IS MIRACULOUS!!! I DON&#x27;T HAVE THOSE DEEP SMOKER GROOVES AROUND MY MOUTH ANYMORE. THIS STUFF IS FANTASTIC. I JUST ORDERED THE BENTONITE CLAY TO ADD TO IT AND I CAN&#x27;T WAIT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT. MAYBE THE CELLULITE IS NEXT.</li>
    <li> Been using for about a week. Starting to see some mild results already. Smell is not great so I Will experiment with adding oils to it to assist.</li>
    <li> Love this powder. It came in a huge jar. Will probably last me for months. I&#x27;ve only used it as a facial mask and probably will just for that. I don&#x27;t need it for cellulite use. The powder is really a fine powder. It does smell fishy like seaweed and a bit strong but if it didn&#x27;t smell like that than it wouldn&#x27;t be the real deal. It&#x27;s seaweed what else is it suppose to smell like?! People on here have complained about the smell, I just deal with it. It&#x27;s not suppose to smell like roses. If you use it with other essential oils mixed in I&#x27;m sure they smell wouldn&#x27;t be that strong. I&#x27;ve just mixed it with plain water to start. It mixed well, no lumps to deal with. Slathered it on my face and waited about 20 minutes. Dryed quick. Washed off with ease and had nice glowing skin. I&#x27;m not sure how it helps with acne as my face is clear but it can&#x27;t hurt it. My skin stayed soft and glowing into the next day. A little bit of powder goes a long way to mix for a facial mask. This stuff is awesome and I&#x27;m glad I got it!</li>
    <li> This really works!  I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and have noticed a difference in the way my skin feels and looks.  I was skeptical at first but I&#x27;m so glad I tried it.  I make the paste and apply it and cover it.  Then rinse it off in the shower.  I will definitely be repurchasing this.</li>
    <li> Love this powder it works great for the skin helps reduce the appearance in cellulite and is a lot more affordable then going to the salon</li>
    <li> I bought this product when I watched the Dr. Oz show and it was recommended as a home treatment for cellulite. I bought it for my daughter and she uses it everyday. I personally use it to exfoliate my face when I mix it with other ingredients. My face comes out nice and smooth. I love this product and will buy again. A++++</li>
    <li> Seems to diminish the signs of cellulite.  Only used twice need to use more to make sure I see a difference</li>
    <li> Just plain old BAD........</li>
    <li> easy to put into a salt scrub for legs</li>
    <li> This item shipped quickly and was exactly as described - a great value for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like many other reviewers, I purchased it to create a salt scrub. I&#x27;m told the ingredient is highly effective in reducing cellulite, however, BE YE WARNED: if you don&#x27;t add an essential oil to the mix, you will smell like Sea World. Probably what you should expect from Seaweed powder, but seriously, the scent is no joke. I mixed it with a generous amount of Peppermint oil and it works great!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this product that long so maybe that&#x27;s why I see no improvement but be warned, this stuff is MESSY! And if you have a small bathroom like me be ready to smell seaweed for the next few days.</li>
    <li> It really works!!!  I see such a big difference in just 2 weeks.  Can&#x27;t wait to see how it works long term.</li>
    <li> Awful smelling even with essential oils . Couldn&#x27;t stomach the smell.</li>
    <li> I use this seaweed powder for body wraps. It works great! Definatelly will buy it again! ! ! ! ! ! ! !  ! !</li>
    <li> Well, this is a challenge for me, but I started this treatment and it seems to be working.  Use the recommended ingredients as a mixture and it really does make your skin feel great.  I believe it&#x27;s worth the price and experience so far is working.</li>
    <li> I saw this in dr Oz and decided to try it wow what a difference it has made. I&#x27;m very pleased with the change in texture if my legs. Leaving for beach and taking shorts. Which I haven&#x27;t worn for years:)</li>
    <li> I made the Dr. Oz seaweed scrub with this and it is helping.  The container is huge and the powder mixes easily.</li>
    <li> This seaweed powder was easy to use as both a scrub and a body wrap. Has a slight odor but with an essential oil added to the mix it was fine. I noticed great results immediately especially after using the seaweed powder as a wrap. But even after using it as a body wrap 10 times the results were still only temporary. I will continue to use this seaweed powder until I finish it (there&#x27;s aLOT in this container - definitely worth the price) especially now that summer is here. Would be great to use just before going to the beach!</li>
    <li> WOW, WOW, WOW!  Cannot get over this product I&#x27;ve done two stomach wraps and I can tell in a major way!!  My clothes even fit better will be definitely ordering more!!!</li>
    <li> I mainly bought it for body wraps and such but I just can&#x27;t get myself to do it (&#x3D;lazy). However, I have been using it 1-2 a week on my skin. I mix it with Aztec Indian Secret Healing clay, lemon and tea tree oil, kelp extract, and argan oil, and I have smaller pores which is such a relief! I do have to continue using it to keep it that way but I don&#x27;t mind - it makes my skin looks great. Maybe I should just go for the body wrap :)&lt;br /&gt;The only pain is in removing it. I don&#x27;t like it and it takes a while  but it is so worth it. It is a great quality seaweed powder, and there is so much of it.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have been using for this past week and it really does work. I have been keeping a personal journal.I am wrapping now as I am typing this. I use it a little differently. Since I was already waist training I use the plastic along with my old waist trainers and since I have 7 children I go clean up and exercise with it. Comes off easily and the smell is a bit strong but I just got use to it.  You can add lemomgrass or something to help with that. Will definitely buy more.</li>
    <li> Very messy and I didn&#x27;t see much change in the areas where it was used. The price wasn&#x27;t high but it&#x27;s not worth spending money on.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome it really does work it takes off inches n makes dry skin like new. I read all of the reviews bout the smell. I love the smell its pure n from the most amazing natural things on earth seaweed. I put lavender for relaxing n get n my health spa sauna  45 min with Saran wrap on n put some mixture on hands/face/neck n top of feet.  Yes entire body when rinsed n dry. I measure n still inch loss. I only have used it 3 times after tonight.  Everyone should try this u will be on the success side. I have not been given any free order for a true review I have not even contacted comp they sent a welcome n some ways to use seaweed mixture. I am honest n I hope more will give this a try.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and works great! I mix with hemp oil and emu oil with a few drops of geranium and frankincense and it helps tone skin and leaves it super soft.</li>
    <li> I was weary about trying this product because I have tried other cellulite reducers and they were all a waste of money. So I thought why not, one more try and thank goodness I did! It&#x27;s smelly (like seaweed) but it actually worked. The instructions suggested many ingredients but I just used 1 cup of the powder with 1 tbsp of sea salt and 2 cups of water. It made a lot but it said if u added more powder it would work quicker and they r right! I applied the clay on my thighs and I waited an hour. The results were mind boggling! I highly recommend this product! I will use this continually to keep and get the results that I&#x27;m looking for! 😀 So happy!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this seaweed powder to use for body wraps. I purchased it to cleanse my face with. I mix the seaweed powder with a few other natural ingredients (raw honey, himalayan salt, turmeric powder and ground Ceylon (true) cinnamon) and add a little water until it forms a paste. Then I apply it to my face using circular motions all over. Then rinse. My face has a golden glow when I&#x27;m done and feels really clean.</li>
    <li> This product is great when used for a seaweed scrub.  You skin is smooth and soft after the first treatment.  The jar is huge and will last for months.  Only downer is that it has a bit of a seaweed smell at first, but it goes away after a few minutes after you put lotion on.</li>
    <li> Thank you very much for the speedy delivery. I can&#x27;t wait to try this Seaweed Powder - Pure Ascophyllum Nodosum (Kelp) Powder.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d  research seaweed powder properties.  As a wrap it help aid n cellulite reduction. As fast as a couple of days. You will see your skin get smoother.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, arrived very promptly</li>
    <li> Too messy; little difference in cellulite.</li>
    <li> This powder really works on your cellulite. BUT the smell is horrible. I used it only once noticed the difference on my legs, but I was sick from my stomach after having to smell it for 20 minutes. I don&#x27;t think I can stand to use it again because of the smell.</li>
    <li> I previously read some of the reviews of this product to gauge how big this jar is compared to other leading brands. I still was not certain it would really be a large jar until I received it. I was pleasantly surprised at the amount that was given, as I have multiple areas I would like to fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first used this product on my face as I have had a lot of stress in my life, and in turn, caused me to break out a little bit and have clogged pores. The smell was not as bad as I expected; I feel a lot of the reviews of that are exaggerated. It is seaweed, so I did not expect it to smell like bath and body works. That being said, it took a moment to get over the smell once it was on my face, but it was not horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the mixture, I simply used tap water mixed with the powder. I immediately started to notice it working. It started to dry on my face, and like many other masks I have tried, my face started itching - signalling that the impurities were being pulled. This happened for a while, about 30 minutes in, it finally was not as bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little scared when I rinsed it off because my face was splotchy all over. I almost thought I had an allergic reaction to it, but it went away in about an hour. I was very pleased with the results I got. My face was very smooth and soft, and much of the clogged pores I had previously were gone. There were a few, but it was not nearly as bad as before. I feel that with continuous use of the product, I will continue to see positive effects as a result of this product. I have noticed that I am glowing more, less prone to clogged pores and pimples, and have seen more youthful skin.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this product and was convinced I would love it.  Granted, I didn&#x27;t expect it to get rid of my cellulite, but I was hoping it would help tone and moisturize my skin a little.  Maybe it would have, if I had continued to use the product.  But the smell was unbearable.  I made the suggested sea salt scrub recipe, and despite adding a good dozen drops of lavender oil, it still smelled like dead fish.  Essential oils can be expensive, and I didn&#x27;t want to waste any more. The scrub was nasty looking.  Like it should be something in a toilet, not something on my skin.  But it is seaweed, so I was expecting the icky look and smell, I just wasn&#x27;t expecting the smell to be so strong.  The worst part though was the dark green stain it left all around the bottom of my bathtub, despite the fact tgast I had the shower heads running the entire time I was using the scrub.  It took quite a while to get my tub white again.  And my skin didn&#x27;t look or feel any different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I wish I could have liked it, but between the nauseating smell and the stain in the tub, I&#x27;m going to have to stop using it.</li>
    <li> Based off of my first experience, most people with that experience would probably give the product 1or 2 stars.. However, I&#x27;m aware of the multitude of benefits of seaweed for your skin and it&#x27;s really not the company&#x27;s fault I had a messy experience; they gave me a high quality product.  Anyways, I mixed it with sink water to use on my face and some of my body.. bad idea.  clumps everywhere! my bathroom became the ocean and my mother became the shark (she wasn&#x27;t too happy before I cleaned it all).  Determined to have a better 2nd experience, I boiled some water on the stove and added the powder, this eliminated the clump issue but I still had to open some windows for the lovely smell.  It does make your skin softer and tighter, you just need the time to use it. I haven&#x27;t used it in a couple of days simply because I&#x27;ve been busy and haven&#x27;t had the time. Overall a good product though if you remember to boil water first :)</li>
    <li> Got it just over a month ago, I have been using it every night and started seeing results within the first 10 days. Absalotly love the stuff.</li>
    <li> Using this with olive oil, as opposed to water, is much easier to apply &amp; remove.  It needs heat, to make it work, so I sat in the sun with it on. I was happy with the results :)</li>
    <li> I have always been baffled that we could put people on the moon but not help every day women with cellulite. I&#x27;ve had terrible cellulite since puberty, now I&#x27;m 36 years old 5&#x27;5&#x27;&#x27; and a size 8. At one time I was a size 16, that weight loss did not help the texture of my skin, neither has age. First the cons: It doesn&#x27;t smell pretty and it is messy. Now the pros: It works, it works, it works!! The first time I mixed it with water and lemon grass essential oil, applied it and wrapped myself up in saran wrap for an hour. The second time I mixed it with Kathys Family lotion- a light organic lotion my skin likes, and water. It wasn&#x27;t as gloppy and went on more evenly. I used it on my stomach, thighs, legs down to my knees, rear end and my upper arms. I wrapped myself up and did a quick kettlebell exercise and some squats to make sure it warmed up. It showers off easily and doesn&#x27;t make a huge mess coming off.  It is just messy going on. The cellulite wasn&#x27;t as bad after just the first application and my usually dehydrated skin appeared more hydrated! If you are losing the cellulite battle like me I highly recommend trying this, even if your skin is just dull I recommend it. There is A LOT in the container. I hardly made a dent and I used it liberally. I think you can get creative and mix it up with just about anything that is good for the skin and make a paste out of it....olive oil, coconut oil, essential oils etc. I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell, but I will definitely suffer through it for the results. I used one of those ultimate lipo applicator wraps for the first time ever available here on amazon one week before trying this. I think the combination of the two are incredible if you have a pretty serious skin dimpling issue like myself, for instance behind the thighs is actually a little painful to the touch. I eat a relatively clean diet and lead an moderately active lifestyle too (but for the first 28 years of my life that was not the case so perhaps the damage had already been done). Prior to purchasing these two products I had given up on the cellulite battle all together for the last 10 years since I had tried and failed miserably at all kinds of lotions, potion and vitamins. I&#x27;m sold on this stuff and plan to use it regularly forever. I actually wore shorts for the first time since I was 13 years old last week and I was not ashamed of my legs at all, granted they weren&#x27;t teenager short shorts, but they were shorts!!</li>
    <li> It is not doing the job that I expected.</li>
    <li> I liked the email that i got from them about all the recipes i can do with it.</li>
    <li> This product is great, it makes your skin soft. I would highly recommend this product, so far I&#x27;ve been using it for facial masks.</li>
    <li> I just started using it and so far I don&#x27;t see a difference regrading cellulite but it feels good on my skin and after the wraps the skin is soft and smooth. The smell is not nice but once covered as a wrap it is OK. Leaves a mess in your bathroom so be careful</li>
    <li> I ordered seaweed powder because I saw it on Dr. Oz show to help with cellulite. And was so excited to get an email from Trove Of Goods on how to do the treatment very helpful . It smells good and feels great . I won&#x27;t know tell later if it really helps with MY cellulite.</li>
    <li> Skeptic turned believer. I use as a mask after dry brushing my face and my skin is now super soft and fresh looking....43 yr old mother who lives in the dry desert.</li>
    <li> I used for more than 3 months and I didn&#x27;t see any difference at all.</li>
    <li> I used this exactly as instructed every day for a week straight, and saw no improvement in my cellulite whatsoever. Other reviewers reported seeing results in that amount of time, or less. Plus, it&#x27;s REALLY stinky. It&#x27;s been a month and the odor still emanates up from my kitchen drain every time I do dishes, from when I rinsed out the bowl there. To be fair, maybe it&#x27;s my type of cellulite. I wasn&#x27;t targeting the stuff on the back of my thighs, below the butt, like most people. My problem area is on the front of my thighs, right above my knees. I&#x27;m already slim, eat right, and exercise, and until age 50, had good legs. I don&#x27;t see my type of cellulite on other women, so maybe it&#x27;s just a weird kind that doesn&#x27;t cooperate with what works for others.</li>
    <li> Product arrived very fast. Very large amount given for the price. I have been using it for a couple weeks, I haven&#x27;t seen a difference yet. Least I didn&#x27;t spend a lot, so my lost their gain.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I use this as a bath soak. It smells like sewer water but if you can get past that it&#x27;s an awesome product :-)</li>
    <li> absolutely fantastic.  I did not get this for cellulite, I was actually getting it to make seaweed masks.  However, I have now used it with olive oil and sea salt for a scrub and noticed a tremendous impact on the cellulite on my thighs in about 3 uses.  I now use it as a cellulite scrub about once a week and it has been fantastic both for cellulite and evening my skin coloration on my chest (I am freckly).  I have even noticed that a small mole I have always had on my chest has been diminishing almost to a point of being completely gone.  I guess you cannot underestimate the helpful qualities of seaweed.  For the most part I have been using this mixed with a little olive oil to make a nice mask for my face that I leave on for about 30mins to an hour and then wash off.  This has an amazing instant effect on fine lines and wrinkles and when put on a just appearing acne spot, seems to make it almost immediately stop.  It smells hideous so I would not suggest greening up your face and trying to curl up with you man (or children, in my case they run off screaming that I look like a zombie but hey, mom&#x27;s need alone time too!).  It is however really fabulous and mixed with olive oil alone for a facial or with olive oil and sea salt for a scrub is absolutely fantastic and well worth it.  I love this produce and will definitely continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Love it for my skin! Helps with dryness!</li>
    <li> Love how easy this is to use and I definitely saw results.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work well as expected</li>
    <li> This is great stuff......try it you will like it.</li>
    <li> Powder not smooth when you try to mix it up with water, so it&#x27;s unconvinient to spend time just to make it smooth. No questions about quality, it is good</li>
    <li> My teenage daughters love this for a facial mask.  It helps control the acne. It doesn&#x27;t get rid of it completely, but it helps.</li>
    <li> Nice to use as a bath soak.</li>
    <li> I found this very messy to use. Didn&#x27;t really notice any help but may just be me as I have very dry skin.</li>
    <li> After one application I noticed a huge difference in my skin. I have pretty bad stretch marks on my stomach from my pregnancy 3 years ago. This helps me so much! It reduced the red and made them softer. I will be buying more as needed.</li>
    <li> Glad I bought this product. I&#x27;ve been using it as a body wrap treatment.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Spa like. Will def purchase again.</li>
