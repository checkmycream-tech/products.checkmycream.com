<li> /&gt;The minute i unscrewed the plastic black ball top the smell of &#x27;expired, old, or stale product&#x27; (choose any word)</li>
<li> it&#x27;s really stupid of these people to not continue a good thing.</li>
<li> I feel as though I am being taken for a fool for even considering continuing to use a product with which I have been so fond of for so long.  </li>
<li> You&#x27;d think my dry skin would just drink it up, but it doesn&#x27;t..</li>
<li> returned it, too costly for such a small bottle.</li>
<li> My only complaint is the fact that you no longer have it in the 30 oz.</li>
<li> size that I previously purchased.</li>
<li> Needless to say, I rushed out to buy the lotion the same day and, since then, have received the same type of compliment</li>
<li> A little pricey though.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste time, money, bubble wrap or stamps on this.</li>
<li> I bought a bottle that was twice this size for  $5.00 less !  </li>
<li> She squeezed a little sample for my hands from small bottle she had in her purse.</li>
<li> It has a very odd smell, nothing like the Jean Nate I have purchased in the past, and I am using Jean Nate for over 40 years.</li>
<li> It seemed whiter than the usual buttery color.  </li>
<li> There was no way I was going to even dab it on my wrist; I guess there&#x27;s just no more Jean Nate.</li>
<li> I also use Jean Nate&#x27;s Silkening Body Powder and the After Bath Splash Mist, which I spray as a fragrance late in the afternoons.  </li>
<li> It is too thick and clotted to come out of the bottle even with determined squeezing.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m looking for some other less expensive lotion !</li>
<li> I purchased 4 of the 8oz bottles as it was much less expensive than the 32 oz.</li>
<li> Unfortunately this batch of Body Lotion seems to be past its prime.  </li>
<li> I was totally dissatisfied and disappointed.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s unfortunate, as the price continues to go off the charts.  </li>
<li> Way too expensive !  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m disappointed in the fact that it does not  he that scent</li>
<li> I now have lotion and body splash that I can&#x27;t use because it&#x27;s bad!!!!</li>
<li> it was watery, and smelled nasty.  </li>

    <li> This was not the same as any Jean Nate Body Lotion I had bought before, or have bought since.  it was watery, and smelled nasty.  It seemed whiter than the usual buttery color.  Will only buy in sets from now on.</li>
    <li> Silky smooth lotion infused with the great scent of Jean Nate!A good value for the price if you are a fan of this wonderful smell for the &#x27;70&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Arrived well packaged and is exactly what I remember using decades ago.  What a find!</li>
    <li> I purchased 4 of the 8oz bottles as it was much less expensive than the 32 oz. bottle.  Do not know why the prices difference and it was a big difference, but I find the lotion as I use to purchase in the stores.  Do not know why the stores no longer carry this as the lotion and after bath splash are terrific together.</li>
    <li> LOVE the smell and it works really great, making you skin soft. A little pricey though.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this batch of Body Lotion seems to be past its prime.  The scent is definitely off.  It&#x27;s unfortunate, as the price continues to go off the charts.  I feel as though I am being taken for a fool for even considering continuing to use a product with which I have been so fond of for so long.  I feel that Revlon is being disingenuous in even releasing these products for sale.  I have been using this product for over 45 years...my granddaughter always teases me that she can find me just by my signature scent.</li>
    <li> Traditional scent, very nice.</li>
    <li> Came quick.  Always like it.</li>
    <li> My mother in law has been using Jean Nate for years &amp; can&#x27;t find it in stores. Thank GOD for the internet.</li>
    <li> This product did not have the original Jean  Nate smell. It has a very odd smell, nothing like the Jean Nate I have purchased in the past, and I am using Jean Nate for over 40 years.</li>
    <li> I have used this for many, many years. When I can&#x27;t find it, I get real testy. When I found it on your site, I was elated.</li>
    <li> This product is great. Has a sexy  clean fragrance and moisturizers making skin feel smooth. It has a fresh fragrance that&#x27;s great in tropical climates.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful!!!!!!!!!!!  I live in a dry climate, and this really makes a difference. I just wish it came in a bigger bottle.</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite summer body lotion.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
    <li> I only bought this product because I love the scent of jean Nate. I&#x27;m disappointed in the fact that it does not  he that scent</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this lotion for awhile &amp; I found it on your website !! I have used this product, along with the cologne for many years</li>
    <li> Only problem was the gift wrapping. A different box and  cheap bow did not justify the added expense. I will not opt for gift wrapping again. I would however, purchase the product again.</li>
    <li> returned it, too costly for such a small bottle.</li>
    <li> i was wary of trying to find this delightful elixir of childhood, and i should have know that it&#x27;s gone with the wind. I found an 8-oz. bottle on Amazon and the price was fair, so I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;The minute i unscrewed the plastic black ball top the smell of &#x27;expired, old, or stale product&#x27; (choose any word) was obvious. There was no way I was going to even dab it on my wrist; I guess there&#x27;s just no more Jean Nate. Manufactured by Revlon, which also I think owns Clinique...it&#x27;s really stupid of these people to not continue a good thing. Every single cosmetic I love ends up discontinued after a short time...that includes fragrance, lipstick, eyeshadow and translucent face powder. But I digress. Don&#x27;t waste time, money, bubble wrap or stamps on this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Jean Nate Body Lotion exclusively since I was in graduate school at the Univ. of Maine, some 50+ years ago and still love it.  A classmate always smelled so fresh and clean so I asked what fragrance she used. She squeezed a little sample for my hands from small bottle she had in her purse. Needless to say, I rushed out to buy the lotion the same day and, since then, have received the same type of compliment many more times over the years than I can possibly count.  I also use Jean Nate&#x27;s Silkening Body Powder and the After Bath Splash Mist, which I spray as a fragrance late in the afternoons.  I do order 3 or 4 of the body lotions at a time as they last me about a year and I can not ever find this item anymore in either brand-drugstore in my area.  It&#x27;s the very best.</li>
    <li> great product have used it for years used to buy value size but could not find it</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to be the same fragrance as the spray</li>
    <li> Way too expensive !  I bought a bottle that was twice this size for  $5.00 less !  What in the world is in this lotion that costs soooo much.  I&#x27;m looking for some other less expensive lotion !</li>
    <li> Revlon should have never discontinued this lotion. My wife swears by it.</li>
    <li> I enjoy using the Body Lotion.  It is very refreshing and the fragrance is great.  My only complaint is the fact that you no longer have it in the 30 oz. size that I previously purchased.</li>
    <li> This is nothing like the Jean Nate lotion I&#x27;ve grown to love. I don&#x27;t believe it is really Jean Nate. It is too thick and clotted to come out of the bottle even with determined squeezing.  I had to remove the lid and then can&#x27;t get it out of the bottle. It doesn&#x27;t smell like Jean Nate lotion.  I was totally dissatisfied and disappointed. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t order the larger bottle!</li>
    <li> You&#x27;d think my dry skin would just drink it up, but it doesn&#x27;t..</li>
    <li> Have used this for years and really love it!  Price way up, though since Jean Nate was purchased by Revlon.</li>
    <li> This is not the Jean Nate I used many years ago.  They have done something to the product that changed the old fragrance into a \\&quot;musky\\&quot; smell.  My husband even commented on the smell as not being the same.  I now have lotion and body splash that I can&#x27;t use because it&#x27;s bad!!!!</li>
    <li> GREAT LOTION.  NICE FRAGRANCE</li>
    <li> This is on my refill list, never disappoints.</li>
