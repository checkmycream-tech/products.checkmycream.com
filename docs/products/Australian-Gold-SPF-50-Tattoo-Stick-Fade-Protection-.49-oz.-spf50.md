      <li>many applications.</li>
      <li>I love this sunblock.</li>
      <li>It smells good though, and seems to work really well.</li>
      <li>makes it easy to find.</li>
      <li>I give a swipe across my tattoo with this, and then use a finger to fine detail it.  </li>

      <li>Its worth the price instead of having to get your tattoos re-done.</li>

      <li>thank you very much</li>
      <li>The only thing that would make it better is if t was waterproof.</li>
      <li>By the end of the day my whole body was sunburned other than my tattoos they were protected and still colorful!!!</li>
      <li>I have a huge Taking Back Sunday tattoo that I had gotten in April of 2012.</li>
      <li>i can&#x27;t really tell if it helped protect my tattoo or not.</li>
      <li>I really like this product.  </li>
      <li>I think the amount you pay is much too pricy for what you get.</li>
      <li>It leaves my tattoo looking bright and vibrant after applying not white and foggy like other sun screens.</li>
      <li>Neither of us burned (he usually tans instead of burning, I usually burn instead of tan) and our tattoos were in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This does it&#x27;s job and is super simple to apply.</li>
      <li>Easy application due to the size of the stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Randy</li>
      <li>have to say that I am amazed by this product since if you are one that is concerned for keeping your tattoos looking new, you probably want to resist sunlight.</li>
      <li>I dont need to massage it in to my skin and it smells nice; like a subtle pina colada.  </li>
      <li>Despite it&#x27;s tiny size, the has lasted through a summer and fall, with more than half remaining to tackle the coming spring</li>
      <li>One time I smeared it up too high and had an obvious color gap where this was applied vs my normal skin.</li>
      <li>Stick is large and oval-- much easier to cover tattoos than other lip balm sized competitors.  </li>
      <li>If it were larger roll on you wouldn&#x27;t be able to get in your tattoo well enough and it would get the other part of your skin.</li>
      <li>This smells great and it works on sun protection of your tattoos but very expensive for the size.  </li>
      <li>If one of you would have at least truthfully given a review by stating &amp;#34;it&#x27;s the size of a matchbook or zippo lighter&amp;#34; then I definitely would not have purchased this item.  </li>
      <li>If you have big tattoos you should need more os this, but for small tattoos is enough.</li>
      <li>The product is small so if you have a lot of tattoos you need to cover you would probably run out quick.</li>
      <li>I got this a few years ago after my first tattoo.  </li>

<li> The product is small so if you have a lot of tattoos you need to cover you would probably run out quick.</li>
<li> I got this a few years ago after my first tattoo.  </li>
<li> When I received the stick it was broken inside and was stuck to the top of the container, does not move up and down correctly.</li>
<li> Small pocket size high SPF to protect your ink.</li>
<li> but it works, I would have expected something a bit larger but nonetheless, it works,</li>
<li> My boyfriend has two tattoos that are a few months old</li>
<li> I have a colorful and expensive 3/4 sleeve tattoo on my left arm that was being wrecked when I drive.  </li>
<li> but I still anticipated something a little bigger than I got.</li>
<li> You don&#x27;t need a lot and it helps to get the small tattoos as well as the large ones as you just slick it on.</li>
<li> I bought this from my tanning salon for 11 dollars, which I thought was so expensive, but worth saving my tattoo for.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s practically the same size and less than half the price.</li>
<li> One stick will last me a little over a month!</li>
<li> I wish it came in a different container other than a small deodorant like container.</li>
<li> I wont try any other product.</li>
<li> I applied heavily once at 8am and a second time a little lighter at 12pm</li>
<li> Would say its a little over priced for such a small amount.  </li>
<li> I have this product and even though it is small it lasts a very very long time.</li>
<li> 50 SPF is a little overkill and isn&#x27;t even recognized by the FDA</li>
<li> I read the other reviews that it was small</li>
<li> It WILL however leave that area untanned and you will have a lighter patch around your work which should fade and blend in a few days.</li>
<li> I tan on a level 5 bed everyday, and the color hasn&#x27;t faded a bit.</li>
<li> it is 50 proof so its a little thick and will fell heavy on your skin</li>
<li> It needs to be small to do the trick.</li>
<li> I keep it in my purse generally, it is small and compact</li>
<li> small</li>
<li> the price for what you get is not worth it!!!</li>
<li> when I got this in the mail, it&#x27;s really small!</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s really small!</li>
<li> The stick is very small</li>
<li> That makes spreading it on a small tattoo difficult.</li>
<li> price, don&#x27;t be shocked by the size, it lasts!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This smells great and it works on sun protection of your tattoos but very expensive for the size.  Still would buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this sunblock. Yes it&#x27;s tiny for the price but it works very well and smells amazing. It leaves my tattoo looking bright and vibrant after applying not white and foggy like other sun screens.</li>
    <li> Smells great and seems to work well. I read the other reviews that it was small but I still anticipated something a little bigger than I got. I think the amount you pay is much too pricy for what you get. I also bought a tatto goo color guard stick. It&#x27;s practically the same size and less than half the price. I would repurchase that item before purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> Work great, very easy to apply. I keep it in my purse generally, it is small and compact and it&#x27;s shape makes it easy to find. I sometimes use it on my face in a pinch if I am outdoors and worried about a sunburn. I recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> Good, but it&#x27;s really small! If you have big tattoos you should need more os this, but for small tattoos is enough.</li>
    <li> I was kinda bummed out when I got this in the mail, it&#x27;s really small! maybe 1/4 the size of a stick of deodorant. It smells good though, and seems to work really well. Just wish it was bigger!</li>
    <li> Thought this sunscreen would have been a bit larger in size for the price.  Its smaller than 1/3 the size of a stick of deodorant.  Would say its a little over priced for such a small amount.  The product itself is good.</li>
    <li> small but it works, I would have expected something a bit larger but nonetheless, it works, thank you very much</li>
    <li> I have a huge Taking Back Sunday tattoo that I had gotten in April of 2012. I was very concerned for the bright sun in Texas to be shining down on my great artwork at Warped Tour (last week). Fortunately, I found this product online and heard some great reviews, so I gave it a go.&lt;br /&gt;I loved it! My boyfriend has two tattoos that are a few months old so we both used this product at Warped Tour- where we were out in the sunlight for about ten hours. Neither of us burned (he usually tans instead of burning, I usually burn instead of tan) and our tattoos were in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that I am amazed by this product since if you are one that is concerned for keeping your tattoos looking new, you probably want to resist sunlight. This product makes sunlight possible!&lt;br /&gt;I personally do not tan in a tanning bed, but I feel like this product would protect the UV Rays of a tanning bed as well as the Sun&#x27;s rays.&lt;br /&gt;Good price, don&#x27;t be shocked by the size, it lasts! Think of it like chap stick- you use it all the time, and it takes forever to run out of it. The price is honestly lower than it should be for the quality.</li>
    <li> Works amazing! Protects your tattoos from fading :) I won&#x27;t tan without it! Smells amazing, non sticky, and goes on with ease!</li>
    <li> The stick is very small but you don&#x27;t need a lot is exactly as described arrived when expected to very happy.</li>
    <li> All of you who have simply said in your review &amp;#34;it&#x27;s small&amp;#34; have grossly missed the mark and as a result, have left me feeling like I&#x27;ve been bamboozled. If one of you would have at least truthfully given a review by stating &amp;#34;it&#x27;s the size of a matchbook or zippo lighter&amp;#34; then I definitely would not have purchased this item.  I don&#x27;t care how good this product is, the price for what you get is not worth it!!! Shame on all you who didn&#x27;t have the courtesy to tell it like it is.</li>
    <li> This does it&#x27;s job and is super simple to apply. It goes on just like deodorant and protects my tattoo before going to the beach or hopping into the tanning bed. 50 SPF is a little overkill and isn&#x27;t even recognized by the FDA but it does it&#x27;s job. It WILL however leave that area untanned and you will have a lighter patch around your work which should fade and blend in a few days.</li>
    <li> Works great soo much easier than trying to outline my tattoos at the tanning bed. Small pocket size high SPF to protect your ink. Solid product!</li>
    <li> I have this product and even though it is small it lasts a very very long time. You don&#x27;t need a lot and it helps to get the small tattoos as well as the large ones as you just slick it on. If it were larger roll on you wouldn&#x27;t be able to get in your tattoo well enough and it would get the other part of your skin. It needs to be small to do the trick. Its worth the price instead of having to get your tattoos re-done. Also, fits well in your pocket, purse, or tanning bag.</li>
    <li> I used this on large tattoos in the sun of florida, did a great job, bit pricey for the amount, not many applications. I like the formula and the smell and texture. Easy application due to the size of the stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Randy</li>
    <li> I have a tattoo with white ink in it so to keep the white from yellowing in the tanning bed. One stick will last me a little over a month!</li>
    <li> I got this a few years ago after my first tattoo.  I use it before I go tanning or out in the sun.  Stick is large and oval-- much easier to cover tattoos than other lip balm sized competitors.  Colors of my tattoos are still vibrant and rich despite the amount of UV Ive received since getting them.  Im looking to get another since mine is running low.  I give a swipe across my tattoo with this, and then use a finger to fine detail it.  One time I smeared it up too high and had an obvious color gap where this was applied vs my normal skin.</li>
    <li> This product has  kept all my tattoos bright and colorful! I use in outside and inside the tannin bed! I recmomend it 100% I wont try any other product.</li>
    <li> I bought this from my tanning salon for 11 dollars, which I thought was so expensive, but worth saving my tattoo for. So far it&#x27;s amazing. It lasts all day, and Protects my tattoo. I tan on a level 5 bed everyday, and the color hasn&#x27;t faded a bit. The only thing that would make it better is if t was waterproof.</li>
    <li> The product is small so if you have a lot of tattoos you need to cover you would probably run out quick. But for a few tattoos its perfect and make application super easy and mess-free.</li>
    <li> The Australian Gold SPF 60 did its job I applied heavily once at 8am and a second time a little lighter at 12pm (after swimming it was still on my skin but I didn&#x27;t want to chance my tattoos getting burned ) I liked how I could see it as I was applying it and the smell is so nice! By the end of the day my whole body was sunburned other than my tattoos they were protected and still colorful!!!</li>
    <li> I have a colorful and expensive 3/4 sleeve tattoo on my left arm that was being wrecked when I drive.  There is nothing like a farmer tan to ruin good ink.  This stick is superior to sun screen lotions in that I do not get it all over my hands and shirt.  I dont need to massage it in to my skin and it smells nice; like a subtle pina colada.  I really like this product.  Despite it&#x27;s tiny size, the has lasted through a summer and fall, with more than half remaining to tackle the coming spring (when I can take off my hoodie).</li>
    <li> Excellent product, easy to use stick to help protect tattoos from sun fade.  Like how it works just like a deodorant stick, it stays on good and is not greasy.</li>
    <li> its great. my tattoos keep their color and it smells wonderful. keep in mind it is 50 proof so its a little thick and will fell heavy on your skin</li>
    <li> i can&#x27;t really tell if it helped protect my tattoo or not. its one of those products you just dont know but the SIZE is so deceiving!</li>
    <li> When I received the stick it was broken inside and was stuck to the top of the container, does not move up and down correctly.</li>
    <li> It seems to be working well. I wish it came in a different container other than a small deodorant like container. That makes spreading it on a small tattoo difficult.</li>
