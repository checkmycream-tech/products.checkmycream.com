      <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this product, it goes great with a cream blush!</li>
      <li>Why would this company not come out with a product she calls magic????</li>
      <li>Have to apply many many layers to achieve any color at all..</li>
      <li>Yes, I should have read the description in more detail, but I didnt</li>
      <li>Settles in wrinkles and makes them more notice.  </li>
      <li>I feel there is much better products out there.</li>
      <li>I love Carmindy but won&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
      <li>The highlighter is frosty and so is the blush - OK if you are looking for a frosty winter look, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I have very fair skin &amp; blue eyes - this helps to highlight both my skin &amp; eyes.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and has long staying power, blends beautifully.</li>
      <li>I am a huge Carmindy Fan</li>
      <li>Great product and would definitely recommend it!</li>
      <li>I was really hoping this would be a nice product.</li>
      <li>The pink looks great under browbone and on top of cheeks, and the white is great to put in the corner of your eyes.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff and love how FAST it got to my house.  </li>
      <li>very pleased..if you want to brighten your eyes and make them pop to enhance the color, this is the product!!!</li>
      <li>(Excuse me now as I go find more Carmindy things to order!!</li>
      <li>Not a powder, really moist, more like a cream.</li>
      <li>Loved this and will make it a regular purchase!</li>
      <li>Delivery was so quick..</li>
      <li>The product arrived quickly and was well packaged.  </li>
      <li>If anyone is aware of one that they like, please let me know!</li>
      <li>, I do think it&#x27;s worth it for the price and will get the job done.</li>
      <li>It gives my skin a really pretty glow.  </li>
      <li>Since I started using it, I have had 3 separate people comment on how pretty my eyes are and ask if I have colored contacts in.  </li>
      <li>PRetty pigments for eyes cheeks..whatever.</li>
      <li>The product she uses to highlight the inner corner of the eye, top of the cheekbones,</li>
      <li>Adds just enough of a healthy luster.</li>
      <li>It is fine used on upper eyelids and on cheek bones.</li>
      <li>The white stays a bit creamier in texture, but it&#x27;s fine, too.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing for contouring and dealing with dark circle under your eyes!  </li>
      <li>This highlighter works really well, even in unskilled hands.  </li>
      <li>Also, I put some on, but could not see it on my face at all (I am very fair-skinned).</li>
      <li>Anyway, if you use no concealer or a concealer that does not brighten, you may really like this product.</li>
      <li>I was not expecting it to look and feel so much like actors/halloween makeup---</li>
      <li>It helps me look refreshed and ready to tackle my day.</li>
      <li>I think this is a great highlighter, it gives me a subtle, natural looking glow</li>
      <li>Love watching Carmindy on What Not To Wear - so sad the last episode just aired - but learned so many things from the show and excited to find the makeup Carmindy uses!  </li>
      <li>Maybe it shouldn&#x27;t be used on older skin?  </li>
      <li>It is like brightening product ON TOP OF brightening product (I used it only above my cheekbone).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a cream but not a thick cream.</li>
      <li>I could buy more, but for some reason it is not available.</li>
      <li>I love this product and wear it everyday</li>
      <li>I thought it blended completely with my skin and left just mild iridescence and no color.</li>
      <li>I gave this 4 stars instead of five only because the products happen to have a certain look on me that is good but not perfect.</li>
      <li>I ended up letting my 7 year old niece play with it.</li>
      <li>At first I was skeptical, but after getting used to using this product I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>I would like to venture into using the pink because I think it would be a little more natural.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use the pink at all, but the white is very pretty.</li>
      <li>so you have to be careful not to pick up too much on your brush.</li>
      <li>I only use the white side, as I haven&#x27;t found the pink shade useful yet.</li>
      <li>I have bought at least 3 different highlighters, this one is definitely the BEST...goes on smoothly, doesn´t fade that fast and makes you look wide awake....</li>
      <li>So far I&#x27;ve only used the white to highlight, and it does work well.</li>
      <li>The white is the most useful part, too bad they dont´t sell it alone.</li>
      <li>It feels really watered down..</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love this product. I am a huge Carmindy Fan anyway and this just added to my make up collection. Great buy and super price!</li>
    <li> When I&#x27;m in a hurry, I dab some of this on my eyes, concealer, and mascara. It helps me look refreshed and ready to tackle my day. It is creamy and you can use your fingers to apply.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s thick &amp; creamy, so I used a triangle sponge to apply by dabbing.  I use it in a &amp;#34;C&amp;#34; shape area around my outer eye/cheek/temple areas.  I only use the white side, as I haven&#x27;t found the pink shade useful yet.</li>
    <li> This is not a powder, but rather a cream. You can&#x27;t use a highlighter brush, blush brush, or fan brush. You have to use a sponge or your fingers. This isn&#x27;t that big of a deal, but I would just prefer a powdered product which I could apply with a brush. Also, I put some on, but could not see it on my face at all (I am very fair-skinned). I had to put several layers on before I could see any illumination. The pink is worse than the white as far as visibility. It definitely does not give the &amp;#34;Carmindy&amp;#34; look from the WNTW show. Also, it doesn&#x27;t last very long, the illumination seems to go away after a few hours. I would not buy again, but instead look for a powdered white or pearlescent illuminator/highlighter which I could apply with a brush. If anyone is aware of one that they like, please let me know!</li>
    <li> I was really hoping this would be a nice product. It&#x27;s a cream but not a thick cream. It feels really watered down.. Have to apply many many layers to achieve any color at all.. Not a worthwhile purchase</li>
    <li> I gave this 4 stars instead of five only because the products happen to have a certain look on me that is good but not perfect. I have very pale skin. The white highlighter is too white, and does nothing much different from what my brightening concealer does. It is like brightening product ON TOP OF brightening product (I used it only above my cheekbone). I know some evaluators saw the pink highlighter as useless. I thought it blended completely with my skin and left just mild iridescence and no color. Anyway, if you use no concealer or a concealer that does not brighten, you may really like this product. I did not find the product too thick or cakey.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t make the splash I expected.  Very subtle, which actually may no be a bad thing...don&#x27;t want to look like a stripper!</li>
    <li> I miss this product!  It&#x27;s amazing for contouring and dealing with dark circle under your eyes!  Whenever I wear this as part of my make up, people would tell me that I should always wear make up!</li>
    <li> Love watching Carmindy on What Not To Wear - so sad the last episode just aired - but learned so many things from the show and excited to find the makeup Carmindy uses!  Love this stuff and love how FAST it got to my house.  (Excuse me now as I go find more Carmindy things to order!!</li>
    <li> I like how the highlighter looks once its on and smoothed out, but a little goes a long way.  It&#x27;s a little gooey in the container so you have to be careful not to pick up too much on your brush.</li>
    <li> I returned it. Was not refunded or replaced. I ordered two. The one I have is a fine product but the distributor  failed to perform.</li>
    <li> This highlighter works really well, even in unskilled hands.  Since I started using it, I have had 3 separate people comment on how pretty my eyes are and ask if I have colored contacts in.  It gives my skin a really pretty glow.  Great product and would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Loved this and will make it a regular purchase!</li>
    <li> Weak pigment...unless that sheer sheen look is what you are going for. The lid arrived cracked off too, which made putting this cream blush in my person impossible.</li>
    <li> Works well to add highlights, as done by Carmindy from What Not to Wear. I use white above lips, by tear ducts and under eyebrows and the pink to highlight upper cheeks.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it would be the same product that Carmindy uses on every episode of (my now off the air favorite TV show :() What Not to Wear. The product she uses to highlight the inner corner of the eye, top of the cheekbones, and under the brow is a nice, airy powder. This product is a cream. Yes, I should have read the description in more detail, but I didnt and it&#x27;s a little different than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I do like this product. So far I&#x27;ve only used the white to highlight, and it does work well. I would like to venture into using the pink because I think it would be a little more natural. The biggest complaint I have is that it doesn&#x27;t last very long. For whatever reason, it seems to rub off of my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, I do think it&#x27;s worth it for the price and will get the job done.</li>
    <li> Bought this because of the results I&#x27;ve seen when used by Carmandy on What Not to Wear.  I was not able to find it locally, so s/h made it more expensive.  These are creams, not powders.  Even though I have tried powdering before and/or after applying on the inner corner of my eyes, I still end up with it gathering in creases in a relatively short amount of time.  It is fine used on upper eyelids and on cheek bones.</li>
    <li> This product I gave three stars because it is unremarkable.  It is just o.k.  It gives you a little brightness on face and eyes.  If you just want a tiny hint of shimmer then this may be o.k.  I feel there is much better products out there.</li>
    <li> Adds just enough of a healthy luster.</li>
    <li> PRetty pigments for eyes cheeks..whatever.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t figure out what to do with this. Not what I expected at all. Not a powder, really moist, more like a cream.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Delivery was so quick..very pleased..if you want to brighten your eyes and make them pop to enhance the color, this is the product!!! Everyone can use this..I discovered this product years ago and when I needed to replace it I searched everywhere and finally found it here...Thank You amazon and Sally Hansen cosmetics!!!</li>
    <li> Great product. Will order again.</li>
    <li> Tried this when undereye concealer didn&#x27;t help/ One sweep under ,my eyes and it totally changes my looks. Just bought my second one!</li>
    <li> Was disappointed in the equality.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s what I was expecting it to be, unfortunately it has no magic wand to make the make-up challenged know how to use it properly. Darn.</li>
    <li> I was looking for the highlighter powder that carmindy uses on almost all her clients and sin ce this was  from her line thought I had found it ...... wrong.  This was an oily cream.  Why would this company not come out with a product she calls magic???? What a dissapointment</li>
    <li> I have bought at least 3 different highlighters, this one is definitely the BEST...goes on smoothly, doesn´t fade that fast and makes you look wide awake....will keep buying it on regular basis.  The white is the most useful part, too bad they dont´t sell it alone.</li>
    <li> I love this product and wear it everyday and I always get complements. At age 48 I actually get away with people thinking I am in my 30&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;Wish I could buy more, but for some reason it is not available.</li>
    <li> I honestly wouldn&#x27;t recommend. I have olive skin and pink wad way toobpink on mr and white made me look like a clown. Both colors were too shinny I ended up letting my 7 year old niece play with it. She uses it as lip gloss</li>
    <li> I think this is a great highlighter, it gives me a subtle, natural looking glow and it&#x27;s easy to use. In the past, I&#x27;ve used expensive department store brands like Burberry and honestly, this gave me the same results. I&#x27;d highly recommend this product, it goes great with a cream blush!</li>
    <li> At first I was skeptical, but after getting used to using this product I absolutely love it. I have very fair skin &amp; blue eyes - this helps to highlight both my skin &amp; eyes. A great buy!</li>
    <li> Settles in wrinkles and makes them more notice.  Maybe it shouldn&#x27;t be used on older skin?  I love Carmindy but won&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter.  She is happy with the product.  The product arrived quickly and was well packaged.  No issues at all.  Nice color.</li>
    <li> I was not expecting it to look and feel so much like actors/halloween makeup--- but it does.  I would have preferred something lighter to highlight.</li>
    <li> I will definitely buy this product again.  I like the two different colors - I use the white for around my eyes, and the pink on my cheeks along with blush.  Works great.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use the pink at all, but the white is very pretty. I wish it stayed on a bit longer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m devoted to What Not to Wear and had been searching and searching for highlighters to use the way Carmindy recommends. I couldn&#x27;t find what I was looking for in drugstores and Walmart, and this is PERFECT! The pink looks great under browbone and on top of cheeks, and the white is great to put in the corner of your eyes. I just feel so glowy when I wear it!!! The texture of the pink highlighter is awesome--goes on sort of powdery soft. The white stays a bit creamier in texture, but it&#x27;s fine, too. I&#x27;m really happy I found this and can stop searching for a good highlighter!</li>
    <li> The highlighter is frosty and so is the blush - OK if you are looking for a frosty winter look, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> Perfect blending, nice color, highlights just as Carmindy instructed on WNTW. It&#x27;s easy to apply and has long staying power, blends beautifully.</li>
</ol>
