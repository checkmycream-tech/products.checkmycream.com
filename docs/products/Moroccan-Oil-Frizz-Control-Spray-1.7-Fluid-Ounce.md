### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This size is excellent for travel as well.</li>
      <li>It leaves your hair with incredible shine.</li>
      <li>I loved it, it is great!!  </li>
      <li>Morocanoil makes great products.</li>
      <li>It does not do a great job for holding the hair, but it smells like paradise.</li>
      <li>Great addition to the Morocanoil Curl Cream.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of it!</li>
      <li>Great product a light weight frizz control oil.</li>
      <li>Absolutely the best anti frizz.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Seemed very light weight compared to the Redken argon oil I use.</li>
      <li>My girlfriend swears by this and won&#x27;t buy anything else any more.  </li>
      <li>So far so good!</li>
      <li>One spray and your hair is transformed from a static mess to great hair!</li>
      <li>It doesnt have a nice scent and it didn&#x27;t really do much for my hair.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;re better off buying the straight oil.</li>
      <li>all Moroccanoil products are Stellar!</li>
      <li>My hair looks great in just a few days.</li>
      <li>This stuff really works!</li>
      <li>I noticed a change from the first application.  </li>
      <li>for some reason it was making my hair extra receptive to static.</li>
      <li>Long hair requires more, but it is worth the price.</li>
      <li>Now I use the shampoo and conditioner, the oil, the curl cream and sometimes the frizz control for those really humid days.  </li>
      <li>I have very wavy frizzy hair</li>
      <li>The stuff really works.  </li>
      <li>I tried to take it back to Dellaria and they couldn&#x27;t help me, even with an exchange, because I didn&#x27;t have the original receipt.</li>
      <li>It made my hair so soft and brought the curl together.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s was taking months for my hair to recover to its natural curl.  </li>
      <li>I expected a texture similar to the original Moroccan Oil product, but in a spray dispenser.  </li>
      <li>I like this product very much, what I don&#x27;t like is the shipping and huddling, to my point of view its a ripe off, you company charge me 4.99 for each bottle, coming in the same box , same plastic wrap, same address</li>
      <li>It has a high alcohol content and seemed drying to my hair, and left it a little sticky instead of soft and shiny like I had hoped.</li>
      <li>So subtle and clean.</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair which tends to be dry.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s not what I&#x27;ve expected</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair which tends to be dry.  A few years ago I started straightening it then after 8 years I decided to let it go curly again.  It&#x27;s was taking months for my hair to recover to its natural curl.  A friend of mine turned me on to Moroccan oil.  I noticed a change from the first application.  It made my hair so soft and brought the curl together.  Now I use the shampoo and conditioner, the oil, the curl cream and sometimes the frizz control for those really humid days.  I tell all my friend about this stuff.........IT SO RAWKS</li>
    <li> I have very wavy frizzy hair and I have tried a ton of products over the years....all Moroccanoil products are Stellar!</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best anti frizz.  My girlfriend swears by this and won&#x27;t buy anything else any more.  This size is excellent for travel as well.</li>
    <li> I did not love this product.  I expected a texture similar to the original Moroccan Oil product, but in a spray dispenser.  It has a high alcohol content and seemed drying to my hair, and left it a little sticky instead of soft and shiny like I had hoped.</li>
    <li> I loved it, it is great!!  I would recommend to everyone. My hair looks great in just a few days.</li>
    <li> I purchased this from Dellaria salons and they were unwilling to take it back. I used it seven or eight times in different circumstances. Dry hair, wet hair, combed through, not combed through. It made my hair sticky and hard, as if I had sprayed it with hair spray, and smelled horrible as if there was a super high alcohol content. Another reviewer mentioned the same thing. I tried to take it back to Dellaria and they couldn&#x27;t help me, even with an exchange, because I didn&#x27;t have the original receipt. I even called MoroccanOil, and they were unwilling to help me, giving me the runaround back to the salon. I have since noticed that their products have a lot of dimethicone in them, with the actual oils being several ingredients down. You&#x27;re better off buying the straight oil.</li>
    <li> I like this product very much, what I don&#x27;t like is the shipping and huddling, to my point of view its a ripe off, you company charge me 4.99 for each bottle, coming in the same box , same plastic wrap, same address, WHAT IS THE BIG DEAL!!! TO BE CHARGED FOR THIS SMALL ENVELOPE $14.99. This is a shame, u should ask me if I want a priority mail.</li>
    <li> Great addition to the Morocanoil Curl Cream. My only complant is that it doesnt last as long as the curl cream. Long hair requires more, but it is worth the price.</li>
    <li> It doesnt have a nice scent and it didn&#x27;t really do much for my hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works!</li>
    <li> This does not work for frizzy hair ! I have thin hair and it tames nothing . I like the brand and their conditioners , but this product has made my hair dryer . If i could i would return it !!</li>
    <li> Great product a light weight frizz control oil. It leaves your hair with incredible shine. You only need a little to make a big difference.</li>
    <li> the bottle was broke when I received it then had to report them to amazon they did not take care of the problem when contacted and if there was a negative star I would give it that.</li>
    <li> The only product that has ever worked. One spray and your hair is transformed from a static mess to great hair!</li>
    <li> I am a Wen user.  I mean I do not cleanse or style my hair with anything but Wen.  Anyway, I need a bit of help in extreme humidity so I&#x27;ve been hearing about Moroccan oil hair products.  I saw this and decided to try it. WOWEEEEE!!!!  The stuff really works.  The next day after sleeping and sweating on my hair, which is very long, it still kept it&#x27;s non frizzy state.  You can use this wet or dry and when you do it does not weight hair down like plain argan oil does.  This is a keeper.</li>
    <li> They sent the wrong item, did not have the right one in stock, lost time and money, really inconvenient for me</li>
    <li> I love the smell of it! I got it for when we had super dry and cold winter days... for some reason it was making my hair extra receptive to static. It seemed to help. I did anywhere from 2-4 sprays when my hair was damp and blow dried it in.&lt;br /&gt;Seemed very light weight compared to the Redken argon oil I use.</li>
    <li> It does not do a great job for holding the hair, but it smells like paradise. So subtle and clean. Would keep using it until I run out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t exactly call it a disappointment but it was a let down. Wish it had worked..</li>
    <li> This spray does not weigh your hair down. It protects your hair form dryness and frizz. Morocanoil makes great products.</li>
    <li> Still experimenting. So far so good!</li>
