### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>/&gt;Other than that, they are pleasant to use as well as convenient.</li>
      <li>The results were good, but not that good.</li>
      <li>Apply to a clean face at night for best results.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the pads twice weekly for over 4 weeks and while I can&#x27;t say they&#x27;ve made a noticeable difference in giving me a more youthful and brighter-looking complexion, I can say that I&#x27;ve experienced fewer blemishes and irritated skin while using the pads.</li>
      <li>For now, I&#x27;d have to say that I think these are effective.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t have particularly scarred skin to make for a perfect test case, but I did have acne as a kid</li>
      <li>If, however, you have dry/combo skin and any sensitivity, best steer clear of these.</li>
      <li>and we LOVE that product.</li>
      <li>With that said, I would gladly recommend this product to any fellow acne sufferers; it has worked wonders for me.</li>
      <li>and says that this one would be in the top group.</li>
      <li>I will revisit this review when more time passes.  </li>
      <li>All in all, I&#x27;m quite pleased with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am sure over time I will see more improvement.</li>
      <li>but you can use them more often if you want.</li>
      <li>These are more like moist towels that you find in restuarants.  </li>
      <li>As with most Proactiv+ products, you&#x27;re paying a premium price for the convenience and the brand</li>
      <li>For the cost of 15 pads I would expect better results.</li>
      <li>These pads are like a moist wipe and are SUPER convenient for travel, which is nice.  </li>
      <li>I will certainly update this review if we end up getting good results with these pads.</li>
      <li>Giving the size and the individual wrapping, this makes them ideal for taking on holiday with you as they take up virtually no</li>
      <li>that I felt confident it&#x27;s a fantastic 5 star product.</li>
      <li>If I do notice anything to get excited about, I will be sure to return to update my post.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 9-18-15:&lt;br /&gt;Was 5 Stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>These pads are both convenient, gentle and somewhat effective.  </li>
      <li>This result may not be the same for all - I think younger, stronger skin could really see good improvement, as the ingredients are impressive.</li>
      <li>I have used the original Proactiv line in my 20&#x27;s and 30&#x27;s</li>
      <li>I used the correcting pads per the instructions - on clean skin, 5 days in a row.</li>
      <li>I used the pads on clean skin, 5 nights in a row then once a week.</li>
      <li>/&gt;That said, the convenient single towelette packaging makes them great for on-the-go, and I can see them having some benefit for people with oily skin.</li>
      <li>The alcohol and glycolic acid in these pads is supposed to clean your skin and provide a mild exfoliant.  </li>
      <li>These are some of the most gentle mark correcting pads I have tried.</li>
      <li>It was a convenient and quick addition to my bedtime routine.  </li>
      <li>They do not require addition of water and the single-use packets are appealing, particularly for people who want to take their skin care regimen on the go without having to pack tons of bottles and</li>
      <li>Mark Correcting Pads for five nights in a row, once a month, and I&#x27;ve noticed improvement in the appearance of some mild acne scarring that&#x27;s plagued me.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, a high-quality product that I would recommend to a friend mainly because I saw some results without peeling that many mark-fading products cause (and I&#x27;ve used a lot).</li>
      <li>me, the side effects, which include an increased sensitivity to the sun (something my fair skin already has) ultimately weren&#x27;t worth the &amp;#34;face time.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>When applied to my face, it stings a tad momentarily, but that sensation subsides quickly, and I don&#x27;t get any visible irritation.</li>
      <li>Overall I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the results and will purchase them again when these run out.</li>
      <li>I would use a hot washcloth and some mild face wash to clean my face, then the pad.  </li>
      <li>This is very easy to use, just open the toilette and apply the moistened pad to clean face.</li>
      <li>But, I can tell you that the compounds in these pads are incredibly powerful astringent agents.</li>
      <li>She tends to have much more sensitive skin than I.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyone concerned about their complexion should already be using a sunblock on a daily basis, but note that using this product increases sun sensitivity and the likelihood of sunburn, making using a good sunblock even more critical.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m hoping for smoother skin and the appearance of less wrinkles while my son wants improvement in dark marks from acne, but at this point I have to be honest and say at best I feel neutral about these pads.</li>
      <li>I think if you had acne issues, you might be the best customer for this product, but for other facial &amp;#34;marks&amp;#34; (scarring, sunspots, etc.)</li>
      <li>While it is great during the hot weather at keeping zits at bay &amp; cleaning the skin, it did little to reduce marks.  </li>
      <li>I guess I&#x27;m just not the right candidate for the</li>
      <li>I will certainly update this review if we end up getting good results with these pads.ohol to dry out pimples.</li>
      <li>I really wasn&#x27;t sure quite what to make of this product - is it for youths with acne problems or adults or both, but always willing to try something new, and I do get some breakouts off and on.</li>
      <li>Maybe too strong if you have naturally drier skin.</li>
      <li>They also contain salicylic acid for a similar effect, but that particular ingredient is no longer effective on my acne-prone skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>(I guess that&#x27;s exactly what these pads are supposed to do).</li>
      <li>The first night proactive did sting when applied</li>
      <li>Proactuve plus mark correcting pads aren&#x27;t exactly what I was expecting.  </li>
      <li>but at $45, I&#x27;m not sure how many more I would be willing to buy.</li>
      <li>I can often use products with alcohol in them (as these have) on my face, but it is pretty hit and miss.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Because of the performance and price, I can give these pads a solid 3 stars and nothing more...</li>
      <li>So this is exactly what I did.</li>
      <li>At first it burned a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I would need more time to determine the lasting benefits of these pads, but I have to say that I think they do have an effect.  </li>
      <li>There are more affordable products that have the same effects.</li>
      <li>generally feel like sometimes these kinds of products will work better for some people, and not as much for others.  </li>
      <li>I love that they are individually packed, as well.</li>
      <li>But if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re trying to do, and you&#x27;re willing to pay quite a bit for it, then this product largely lived up to its promises in my experience.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Strong medicine and perhaps effective--so strong the package counsels to only use one a week.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t feel that much unlike a stridex pad.  </li>
      <li>so I really don&#x27;t expect to see rapid</li>
      <li>much cheaper.r /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
      <li>It appears to be gentle-</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take off the marks fast.</li>
      <li>If I understand the directions correctly, use this once a week unless you want some intense treatment; then five days in a row (which I did).</li>
      <li>so I believe it was really irritated.  </li>
      <li>These work very well.</li>
      <li>I went through the 15 pack I found less and less skin being removed, and the mildly irritated feeling I would get was greatly reduced.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;After the first 5 days usage my skin did feel healthier but also a lot dryer than normal</li>
      <li>Thanks to all the summer sweating</li>
      <li>He has used many other similar products (e.g. Acne Free, etc.)</li>
      <li>so I was interested to use some of their new Proactiv Plus line.  </li>
      <li>to deep clean my pores of dirt and oil and blast those pimples away.  </li>
      <li>, I found this particular product very drying.  </li>
      <li>I have used the pads for only two weeks, but I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that they are too strong for my old, 80 year-old skin.  </li>
      <li>I took particular notice of the warning regarding sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>pads contain a mix of ingrediants, one of the main ones being alcohol.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall then Proactive does the job it&#x27;s intended to do but for my liking the price is way too high.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall then Proactive does the job it&#x27;s intended to do but for my liking the price is way too high.  </li>
      <li>glycolic and salicylic acids were gently and did not cause drying or peeling, my skin actually felt softer and smoother after the first use.  </li>
      <li>But I&#x27;m leery of the alcohol, and the way these pads feel remind me of when I was a teen and didn&#x27;t know any better than to wipe my face with a cotton ball saturated in witch hazel or alcohol to dry out pimples.</li>
      <li>The convenient individually packed pads also made it super easy to throw a few into my travel case for use while out of town for a week.</li>
      <li>I used the pads 5 days in a row one week and again on the second week and noticed softening of newer acne red marks and some lightening of freckles; however, I think probably longer use is required to minimize fine lines or wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>You can then use your normal acne products afterwards, if desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These pads make my skin very smooth, especially around the nose and other flaky areas.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of Proactiv+ Emergency Blemish Relief, but only time will tell if these pads produce a visible benefit that outweighs using a product that has alcohol listed as the second ingredient.</li>

      <li>I think this is a pretty solid over-the-counter skin product!</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t realize denatured alcohol is the second ingredient after water - an ingredient that I&#x27;ve read in high concentration can damage skin - and so far I don&#x27;t see any positive improvement.  </li>
      <li>I am happy to report that by the next morning my tiny pimples are dried up red dots rather than white heads.  </li>
      <li>If you have sensitive skin, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using the pads because of the alcohol content.</li>

      <li>You can find similar products much cheaper.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My son and I have been using the Proactiv+ Emergency Blemish Relief [[ASIN:B00TI6TSLO Proactiv+ Emergency Blemish Relief, 2 tubes (0.33 ounce each)]] and we LOVE that product. Both of us have had such fast visible results (me for spot blemishes and him for acne) that I felt confident it&#x27;s a fantastic 5 star product. But the Proactiv+ Mark Correcting Pads are harder to gauge in the short term as the recommended use is once a week to gently exfoliate and promote smoother skin, reduce the appearance of wrinkles, fine lines, post-acne dark marks, etc. I&#x27;m hoping for smoother skin and the appearance of less wrinkles while my son wants improvement in dark marks from acne, but at this point I have to be honest and say at best I feel neutral about these pads. I didn&#x27;t realize denatured alcohol is the second ingredient after water - an ingredient that I&#x27;ve read in high concentration can damage skin - and so far I don&#x27;t see any positive improvement.  At the same time, I like the brand and this is a product that&#x27;s recommended use is just once a week, so I really don&#x27;t expect to see rapid improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering these pads have alcohol and witch hazel, as well as glycolic acid and salicyclic acid, I do feel like the pads are reasonably gentle for a formulation that sounds harsh. When applied to my face, it stings a tad momentarily, but that sensation subsides quickly, and I don&#x27;t get any visible irritation. The pads don&#x27;t leave my my face red, but in the short time using the pads my skin is already dry and flakey. To me, the pads feel like a strong facial toner as they leave my skin dry and tight and, even after washing my face thoroughly before use, the pad is slightly discolored after wiping my face. I don&#x27;t know if the residue is &amp;#34;cellular debris&amp;#34; or just left over makeup residue. But I&#x27;m leery of the alcohol, and the way these pads feel remind me of when I was a teen and didn&#x27;t know any better than to wipe my face with a cotton ball saturated in witch hazel or alcohol to dry out pimples. Unfortunately, my impression so far is that the correcting pads are  going to make my wrinkles more pronounced by drying my skin out too much. My teenage son with oily skin is also trying the pads for dark spots he has from acne. The pads don&#x27;t sting his face, and he has no visible irritation either. But it&#x27;s just too soon to notice any results. As of now, I feel lukewarm about the correcting pads and can only give 3 stars. I&#x27;m a huge fan of Proactiv+ Emergency Blemish Relief, but only time will tell if these pads produce a visible benefit that outweighs using a product that has alcohol listed as the second ingredient.

I will certainly update this review if we end up getting good results with these pads.</li>
    <li> I have used the pads for only two weeks, but I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that they are too strong for my old, 80 year-old skin.  Maybe I was naive in thinking that I could improve my skin at this age.  My skin reddened, and took days to calm down.  This result may not be the same for all - I think younger, stronger skin could really see good improvement, as the ingredients are impressive.</li>
    <li> I have not used Proactiv products for years, but I decided to try the Mark Correcting Pads to see if I could improve some dark spots.  The pads, themselves, are very small, but do a decent job.  I followed the directions and used one pad once a week.  While I noticed very little change in my complexion, it did seem to cut down on the oily feeling in my t-zone.  However, it did not do enough to entice me to pay the high price to continue using the pads.  While they did not work for me, it is likely they would have a stronger impact on someone using the entire Proactiv system, so unless you faithfully use Proactiv, I would say pass on these.  There are more affordable products that have the same effects.</li>
    <li> I guess I&#x27;m just not the right candidate for the Proactiv+ Mark Correcting Pads regimen.  Although I like the idea of exfoliating &amp;#34;rough, dull  layers of skin&amp;#34; and reducing &amp;#34;the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles,&amp;#34; my face just wasn&#x27;t up to the residual discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s because I tend to have quite sensitive skin that is tends be be quite dry rather than oily and it&#x27;s been decades since zits have been an issue, but I found the 5% Glycolic acid in each pad to cause prolonged stinging followed by an extra amount of dryness that I really didn&#x27;t need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a result, I probably didn&#x27;t stay with the regimen long enough to see if they resulted in their promised &amp;#34;more even, youthful and brighter-looking complexion.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the side effects, which include an increased sensitivity to the sun (something my fair skin already has) ultimately weren&#x27;t worth the &amp;#34;face time.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I really wasn&#x27;t sure quite what to make of this product - is it for youths with acne problems or adults or both, but always willing to try something new, and I do get some breakouts off and on. This is very easy to use, just open the toilette and apply the moistened pad to clean face. If I understand the directions correctly, use this once a week unless you want some intense treatment; then five days in a row (which I did). I do have some reddish issues, as well as dry skin flakiness that pops up the second I apply makeup, and I noticed a definite improvement with both problems after a few days. This would be a problem I would like to buy once my supply runs out - but - the price point is a bit out of my league. The results were good, but not that good.</li>
    <li> The chief selling point of Proactiv+ Mark Correcting Pads is convenience.  It&#x27;s an all-in-one product containing cleanser, astringent, and exfoliator in convenient, single-use towelettes.  As with most Proactiv+ products, you&#x27;re paying a premium price for the convenience and the brand name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The exfoliators, glycolic acid and salicylic acid, are about half the strength found in most over-the-counter products so might be less likely to cause sensitivity reactions.  My skin is fairly sensitive, but I found using the pads once a week only mildly irritating, albeit very drying.  They did seem to work as an exfoliator, although I didn&#x27;t notice any significant difference in wrinkles or dark skin marks during the limited time I&#x27;ve been testing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone concerned about their complexion should already be using a sunblock on a daily basis, but note that using this product increases sun sensitivity and the likelihood of sunburn, making using a good sunblock even more critical.</li>
    <li> These actually made me break out. My complexion was relatively clear prior to using these. After 10 days of use, I was very broken out. I will not be using them again.</li>
    <li> I like these pads a lot. I use them about twice a week and have noticed a slight improvement in my skin over the past two weeks. I am sure over time I will see more improvement. Instructions say you should use once a week but you can use them more often if you want. Because they contain alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) and they are doing a slight peel it is recommend that you use sunscreen and wear protective clothing if you go out in the sun. I usually always wear a tinted sunscreen on may face and a hat so I have not experienced any problems with sunburn. I would definitely use this product again. Apply to a clean face at night for best results.</li>
    <li> I used the correcting pads per the instructions - on clean skin, 5 days in a row. After the fifth day, I still didn&#x27;t see a difference in my skin. The pads cleansed my skin but other than that, I didn&#x27;t see any changes. If you have sensitive skin, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using the pads because of the alcohol content. For the cost of 15 pads I would expect better results. You&#x27;d be better off using a less harsh product to cleanse your skin.</li>
    <li> I use these Proactive+ Mark Correcting Pads for five nights in a row, once a month, and I&#x27;ve noticed improvement in the appearance of some mild acne scarring that&#x27;s plagued me. My skin-tone seems to have improved, as well.  This product is convenient: each pad is individually packaged.  It appears to be gentle- I haven&#x27;t had my eyes swell shut or my skin burn for days, and I have really sensitive skin, so this is a plus.  You can use these pads on your chest and back, as well.  I think this is a pretty solid over-the-counter skin product!</li>
    <li> These mark correcting pads are designed to improve your skin through the chemical exfoliating action of glycolic acid. They also contain salicylic acid for a similar effect, but that particular ingredient is no longer effective on my acne-prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get 15 pads, individually packaged. You either use one/week, or one 5 days in a row. You can then use your normal acne products afterwards, if desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These pads make my skin very smooth, especially around the nose and other flaky areas. No irritation, but I think the concentration of glycolic acid is very low, since this product isn&#x27;t rinsed from the skin after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I like.</li>
    <li> We don&#x27;t know quite what to make of these mark &amp;#34;correcting&amp;#34; pads. Proactiv bills them as a supplement to your beauty regimen, and the normal use is to open one of the small packets and pull out the small pad (much like a smaller,more delicate version of a wet-nap) and wipe it on your face, ONCE A WEEK.  Alternately, you can use one pad daily for 5 days in a row, ONCE A MONTH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I generally feel like sometimes these kinds of products will work better for some people, and not as much for others.  The alcohol and glycolic acid in these pads is supposed to clean your skin and provide a mild exfoliant.  I think if you had acne issues, you might be the best customer for this product, but for other facial &amp;#34;marks&amp;#34; (scarring, sunspots, etc.) it didn&#x27;t seem to have any effect.  And at about $3 for each little pad, it seems a little pricy.</li>
    <li> These work very well. A few quick swipes really do add a cleansing sheen to my face, and the exfoliant leaves behind a pleasant, invigorating tingle to ler me know it&#x27;s working. And there&#x27;s no burn, either, even if I run it over a small cut or scrape.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these once a week after washing my face before going to bed (as indicated in the directions).  I was concerned they might be too harsh for my sensitive skin, but that has not been the case.  Thanks to all the summer sweating I&#x27;m doing while working my farm, I am of course breaking out.  Rather than pop these tiny pimples, I decided to see if these wipes would work as they claim.  I am happy to report that by the next morning my tiny pimples are dried up red dots rather than white heads.  There is enough to the wipe to allow me to wipe my shoulders where I also tend to break out in summer.  I am constantly surprised by the additional dirt that comes off on the wipes considering I already washed my face.  As far as reducing scars/marks all I can say is I think my pores are smaller, but so far I haven&#x27;t noticed any major skin improvements - I have a few very very minor acne scars &amp; a few chicken pock scars that do not appear to have changed so far, but I&#x27;m not done with the box (13 weeks to go) so time will tell.  If I do notice anything to get excited about, I will be sure to return to update my post.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 9-18-15:&lt;br /&gt;Was 5 Stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used all the pads.  While it is great during the hot weather at keeping zits at bay &amp; cleaning the skin, it did little to reduce marks.  I can see no real difference in the appearance of my skin after 15 weeks.</li>
    <li> I have used the original Proactiv line in my 20&#x27;s and 30&#x27;s so I was interested to use some of their new Proactiv Plus line.  These pads are like a moist wipe and are SUPER convenient for travel, which is nice.  They are on the pricy side, however... I used the pads on clean skin, 5 nights in a row then once a week. The pads cleansed and dried up pimples on my skin but other than that, I didn&#x27;t see any changes as far as the &amp;#34;correcting&amp;#34; part of the product.  No fading or changes in lines/marks. If you have really sensitive skin, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using the pads because the AHA and salicylic acid as these pad ingredients DO have a slight &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;drying&amp;#34; effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the performance and price, I can give these pads a solid 3 stars and nothing more...</li>
    <li> These pads are both convenient, gentle and somewhat effective.  They do not require addition of water and the single-use packets are appealing, particularly for people who want to take their skin care regimen on the go without having to pack tons of bottles and jars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glycolic and salicylic acids were gently and did not cause drying or peeling, my skin actually felt softer and smoother after the first use.  I used the pads 5 days in a row one week and again on the second week and noticed softening of newer acne red marks and some lightening of freckles; however, I think probably longer use is required to minimize fine lines or wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a high-quality product that I would recommend to a friend mainly because I saw some results without peeling that many mark-fading products cause (and I&#x27;ve used a lot). Ain&#x27;t nobody got time for peeling mark-fading products!</li>
    <li> I followed the directions for these mark correcting pads, one per night for five nights.  After the five nights, I saw no difference in my skin.  Marks were still there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the lack of mark removal, I found this particular product very drying.  I won’t be using it further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two Stars!</li>
    <li> I have naturally oily skin and quite a few marks that I&#x27;d like to get rid of. I don&#x27;t detect any help on the mark front. But, I can tell you that the compounds in these pads are incredibly powerful astringent agents. Maybe too strong if you have naturally drier skin. After wiping my face with one of these, I felt like it might crack it was so dry. It also stang--it actually hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strong medicine and perhaps effective--so strong the package counsels to only use one a week. I will try again in a few days and see if I notice any improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last note: my wife observed that these pads are NOT for anyone with rosea. It will actually make the condition worse.</li>
    <li> Proactuve plus mark correcting pads aren&#x27;t exactly what I was expecting.  I&#x27;ve used products like these before and they usually come as cotton wool pads soaked in whatever the applicant is.  These are more like moist towels that you find in restuarants.  Each of the 15 correcting pads are individually wrapped.  Giving the size and the individual wrapping, this makes them ideal for taking on holiday with you as they take up virtually no room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pads contain a mix of ingrediants, one of the main ones being alcohol.  When using this tends to have a burning sensation on your skin.  According to the instructions you are supposed to use these only once a week (therefore you get nearly 4 months supply in one box) however if you just starting to use these it is recommended that you use them once a night for 5 nights in a row, once a month then move onto once a week for the remainder.  So this is exactly what I did. The first night proactive did sting when applied but that doesn&#x27;t last too long.  By the third night things weren&#x27;t nearly as bad.&lt;br /&gt;After using you can see the dirt and grime it removes from your face on the pad.  Over time you can actually see the difference on the pad as the amount of grime reduces. It does however leave you a raw feeling in your face and living in the South I took particular notice of the warning regarding sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first 5 days usage my skin did feel healthier but also a lot dryer than normal (I guess that&#x27;s exactly what these pads are supposed to do). However I did not notice any phsyical difference in my appearance with smoothing out of features and having smoother skin, a claim made by proactive.  Proactive specifically states that it helps fade out and reduces paast acne marks which I have found not to be the case, however Proactive does not say how long this process takes.  I&#x27;ve only been using the product for a little over 2 weeks now (first 5 days, then once the next week as per the instructions).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How does the Proactive system compare to other alcohol based products that are on the market?  For a start Proactive is much more expensive with the mark correcting pads costing $3 each ($45 for the box).  Apart from the price difference though I can&#x27;t really see a big difference with other products that I have used.  They all fairly much do the same thing.  The big plus with Proactive is the portability and ease of use. Simply take the pad out of the packet and use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall then Proactive does the job it&#x27;s intended to do but for my liking the price is way too high.  You can find similar products much cheaper.r /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How does the Proactive system compare to other alcohol based products that are on the market?

    <li> These are some of the most gentle mark correcting pads I have tried. They seem to be making a difference in my marks, so I&#x27;m going to keep using them. I love that they are individually packed, as well.</li>
    <li> I think after you use them for so long they dont work...just my opinion</li>
    <li> I would need more time to determine the lasting benefits of these pads, but I have to say that I think they do have an effect.  Unfortunately, my wife found that they made her face burn even the next morning and she discontinued use.  She tends to have much more sensitive skin than I.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have particularly scarred skin to make for a perfect test case, but I did have acne as a kid and I do have a lot of larger pores.  Upon applying these pads, I found that my skin does look subtly smoother.  Over time I would expect that effect to increase.  I will revisit this review when more time passes.  For now, I&#x27;d have to say that I think these are effective.</li>
    <li> Proactiv. How can you go wrong? The products have stood the test of time because they work and the results are real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, there is no miracle cure for acne. If there was, a cure for mortality would be close behind. But I&#x27;ve found that Proactiv products stand up to their claims and that includes this one.</li>
    <li> For me, I don&#x27;t use the rest of the system so I don&#x27;t know what the rest of the regimine is. I used these as one of the suggestions for 5 days. At first the product burned my face a little, especially close to my eyes..not very close though.  The product is a little gritty which is fine with me. It seems it has cleaning properties but I felt really weird letting the product stay on my face overnight and had to fight with my inner being to NOT wash it off.&lt;br /&gt;My face seems smoother but it in no way gets rid of any brown spots and my husband says that the skin on my face looks red and irritated.  He didn&#x27;t know I was trying the product so I believe it was really irritated.  Maybe I just didn&#x27;t see it.&lt;br /&gt;This product is pretty expensive and not something I would buy all the time.  I will however use the rest as one of the recommendations says at once per week. I also have some tiny bumps coming up that I have noticed.  Be very careful what you put on your face as it all comes back around as you age.</li>
    <li> Even at age fifty I am still self-conscious about my acne so I joined the ranks of pop stars, actors, actresses and teenagers and started a Proactiv heathy skin regiment of cleanse, tone and repair.  In two weeks my skin cleared up dramatically but every so often a pesky pimple or two does come back.  During these times I ad the Proactiv + Mark Correcting pads to my daily regiment to deep clean my pores of dirt and oil and blast those pimples away.  Each wipe is individually wrapped to seal in the moisture and can be conveniently stored in a wallet or purse.  Designed to be used once a week, or five nights in a row once a month for dark spots, it&#x27;s active ingredient glycolic acid will exfoliate dead skin cells revealing the healthier looking skin below.  But a word of warning, some people who have used this product have developed rashes and minor skin irritations.  With that said, I would gladly recommend this product to any fellow acne sufferers; it has worked wonders for me.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, so for people with oiler and tougher skin, this review might not be for you. If, however, you have dry/combo skin and any sensitivity, best steer clear of these. I can often use products with alcohol in them (as these have) on my face, but it is pretty hit and miss. The Proactiv+ Mark Correcting Pads are a miss. Each time I use these, my skin becomes red and inflamed. I&#x27;ve persevered nonetheless to see if they could provide any actual &amp;#34;mark correcting,&amp;#34; but besides making my skin drier, I haven&#x27;t seen any long term changes in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, the convenient single towelette packaging makes them great for on-the-go, and I can see them having some benefit for people with oily skin. They just aren&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t take off the marks fast.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the pads twice weekly for over 4 weeks and while I can&#x27;t say they&#x27;ve made a noticeable difference in giving me a more youthful and brighter-looking complexion, I can say that I&#x27;ve experienced fewer blemishes and irritated skin while using the pads. I like that the pads remove any makeup residue left after cleansing for the evening. The convenient individually packed pads also made it super easy to throw a few into my travel case for use while out of town for a week. Overall I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the results and will purchase them again when these run out.</li>
    <li> I asked my acne-prone son to try these out and see if they helped the face on his skin. His summary pronouncement is that he likes the Proactiv+ product and felt that it helped reduce the number and severity of existing blemishes on his face. It did lighten some of the darkness and scarring on those blemishes, but it was not a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; cure. He has used many other similar products (e.g. Acne Free, etc.) and says that this one would be in the top group. That said, he also would probably not buy them at their nominal price of over forty dollars for 15 pads. He would be interested if they were about half that. If they cost fifteen dollars a package (one dollar a pad) he would definitely buy them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, they are pleasant to use as well as convenient. And, once again, they did have a noticeable benefit for his tough acne issues. It would have been a five star product except when considering cost and the shortfall, in his opinion, of the skin lightening effect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these now for a month, one a week. My skin is noticeably smoother and less greasy, even in the hot and humid weather. I have sensitive, acne prone skin and it is not at all irritated, which surprised me because usually these types of pads or wipes do leave a sting. All in all, I&#x27;m quite pleased with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My question with these types of products is how long do you have to use them before you see &amp;#34;fine lines and dark spots&amp;#34; disappear? I still have a couple months left but at $45, I&#x27;m not sure how many more I would be willing to buy. I will update this review if I see a dramatic change at the end of 15 weeks.</li>
    <li> This is a 15 pack of pads that I used every three days for about six weeks.  The instructions say you can use them frequently at first and once a week later on, so you may find a different schedule works for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a couple of scars on my forehead and large scar on my back from surgery, and after using the pad on my face I would use it on the scar on my back.  They don&#x27;t feel that much unlike a stridex pad.  I would use a hot washcloth and some mild face wash to clean my face, then the pad.  There is an alcohol smell, the pads removed a bit of grime the washcloth missed.  I also think it removed a bit of dead skin.  At first it burned a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I went through the 15 pack I found less and less skin being removed, and the mildly irritated feeling I would get was greatly reduced.  It was a convenient and quick addition to my bedtime routine.  I like that each pad is individually wrapped so that product isn&#x27;t wasted over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the pack, my facial scars are noticably reduced.  I&#x27;m honestly surprised it worked as well as it did.  The scar on my back looks the same, unfortunately, but I may have been stretching the product too far.  I think I would have to use this stuff for months and months to make the scars go away, and when I consider the price I have decided not to bother.  But if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re trying to do, and you&#x27;re willing to pay quite a bit for it, then this product largely lived up to its promises in my experience.</li>
