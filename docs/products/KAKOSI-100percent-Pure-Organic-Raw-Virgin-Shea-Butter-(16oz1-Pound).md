      <li>but I&#x27;ve heard that shea butter can have a very strong smell-</li>
      <li>Has a delicious scent and is a warm, buttery yellow.</li>
      <li>There are so many sketchy sheas out there.</li>
      <li>one that many people don&#x27;t like)?</li>
      <li>I love it and have started to use it on my scalp, hands and elbows.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really glad I ordered it.  </li>
      <li>The packaging was great, very professional.</li>
      <li>and it goes rancid very quickly.  </li>
      <li>The shea butter is a beige color and melts easily.</li>
      <li>but the butter has strong smell and aftertaste</li>
      <li>A super creamy butter that is wonderful for my dry skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought organic shea butter only once before, but that butter had a very light and pleasant nutty smell to it.</li>
      <li>The color is soft ivory, and the smell is pleasantly nutty.  </li>
      <li>It fantastic for the skin</li>
      <li>, I take a handful of it and apply everywhere with fantastic results.</li>
      <li>This stuff is silky and smooth.</li>
      <li>Arrived promptly with free shipping over $25...</li>
      <li>The smell is very fresh.</li>
      <li>I started using it as a moisturizer after shaving and the results have simply been amazing!</li>
      <li>great for skin in dry weather and humid.</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t want bright yellow</li>
      <li>The scent is pleasant and not overpowering as some of the other kinds I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>It has been my favorite Shea butter to work with so far.</li>
      <li>Kakosi, essential depot and mountian rose herbs (not on amazon) all have high quality, genuine, and certified organic product.</li>
      <li>The consistency and size of pieces is terrific - very easy to work with.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure if it were melted into a container it&#x27;d have the same smooth texture as the whole foods one.</li>
      <li>Smells fresh and pure.</li>
      <li>Our dollar is our vote in a totalitarian economy (&amp;#34;Wendell berry&amp;#34;)...  </li>
      <li>I hesitated paying more for this, but I feel totally confidant using it.  </li>
      <li>It is still pretty thick though and does a great job of keeping skin moisturized.</li>
      <li>This is the first time I have ever purchased Shae Butter</li>
      <li>and I still have a lot left over:)</li>
      <li>It gets absorbed into the skin quickly after application (which takes time and heat, since the shea butter is solid from being in the fridge).</li>
      <li>I have tried every organic lotion available and the key ingredient in all of them is shea butter.</li>
      <li>Plus it was cheaper than the one I bought in whole foods.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s turned out very well with my oils for my hair .</li>
      <li>so it blends in very well.</li>
      <li>KAKOSI brand is the real deal.  </li>
      <li>So much value.</li>
      <li>and I hope that the next order is fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Seller contacted me and offered to replace the product free of charge.</li>
      <li>The only thing that bothers me about the butter is that it smells kind of strange (almost a synthetic/plastic smell).</li>
      <li>It smelled like shea butter, but the fact that it was bright yellow meant that it had been dyed with a root extract OR was not genuine shea butter at all but rather</li>
      <li>As we support goodness we get high quality goodness, and that&#x27;s what this Shea butter is.</li>
      <li>I wonder which is suppose to be normal</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t imagine ordering anything from Africa uncertified as the chance of wage slavery and abuse is too high for me to justify supporting financially.</li>
      <li>What I received was two tubs of a soft, thick, bright yellow substance.  </li>
      <li>Raw shea has a fairly strong natural smell.  </li>
      <li>I use it at night after my vitamin A cream, as it also has natural vitamin A in it as well.</li>
      <li>I bought Organic Shea Butter at my local whole foods to compare them.</li>
      <li>The individual chunks were separated in the package, but I did order this in the fall and keep it in a cool, dry cabinet.  </li>
      <li>but it wasn&#x27;t a major deal as far as I can tell.</li>
      <li>(until my mixer whisk made indentations into it) and whipped it on high for several minutes until it looked like cake frosting.  </li>
      <li>It comes in chunks, the way true raw shea butter should.  </li>
      <li>And you can&#x27;t beat the price - ten dollars for genuine organic raw shea butter.  </li>
      <li>thick Creamy smoothness, with an oppression free product.</li>
      <li>I melted it down in a pot of hot water and poured it into a big jar.</li>
      <li>Totally raw, smell was mild enough to mask with essential oils.  </li>
      <li>This is my first experience with raw shea butter.  </li>

    <li> This is amazing! A super creamy butter that is wonderful for my dry skin. I use it at night after my vitamin A cream, as it also has natural vitamin A in it as well. My skin glows!</li>
    <li> My wife and I didn&#x27;t like the smell and taste of this shea butter. I tried to make some chocolate but the butter has strong smell and aftertaste like it&#x27;s not fresh. There was no &amp;#34;best before&amp;#34; date on the packaging. Totally useless for cooking.</li>
    <li> I was given a small container of Sudanese Virgin Shea Butter as a gift while in Nairobi, Kenya about a year ago. I started using it as a moisturizer after shaving and the results have simply been amazing! All the dark areas of my face that were a result of shaving are gone! That small container (about 3 oz) lasted me about a year and I bought this as a replacement. It only takes a dab at a time so I fully expect this container to last me a few years (I keep it in the frig). I love it and have started to use it on my scalp, hands and elbows. I promise you it&#x27;ll take years off your appearance!!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have ever purchased Shae Butter but it smelled fairly pleasant and was easy to use for what I wanted. I made a lotion out of it with cocoa butter &amp; coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading reviews for other Shae butters I was concerned it would arrive smelling rancid, but it was just slightly nutty and plain.</li>
    <li> The shea butter is a beige color and melts easily. It is still pretty thick though and does a great job of keeping skin moisturized. I have dry skin even in the summer, but this keeps it well moisturized. The only thing that bothers me about the butter is that it smells kind of strange (almost a synthetic/plastic smell). I&#x27;ve bought organic shea butter only once before, but that butter had a very light and pleasant nutty smell to it. I wonder which is suppose to be normal (I&#x27;m assuming the latter is but I&#x27;ve heard that shea butter can have a very strong smell- one that many people don&#x27;t like)?</li>
    <li> There are so many sketchy sheas out there. This one was awesome.  Totally raw, smell was mild enough to mask with essential oils.  Raw shea has a fairly strong natural smell.  But don&#x27;t buy bleached and deodorized shea.  It&#x27;s not good for you and it goes rancid very quickly.  I hesitated paying more for this, but I feel totally confidant using it.  I&#x27;m really glad I ordered it.  Makes incredible whipped body butter.</li>
    <li> Great price, easy to store in the fridge, I take a handful of it and apply everywhere with fantastic results. It gets absorbed into the skin quickly after application (which takes time and heat, since the shea butter is solid from being in the fridge). Has a delicious scent and is a warm, buttery yellow.</li>
    <li> great for skin in dry weather and humid.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Would prefer it in a plastic jar or closed container.</li>
    <li> Very impressed with this product. The consistency and size of pieces is terrific - very easy to work with.  The smell is very fresh. It has been my favorite Shea butter to work with so far.</li>
    <li> I have tried every organic lotion available and the key ingredient in all of them is shea butter. Now I just apply it directly ... much less expensive and no additives I don&#x27;t want!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in a recent purchase of \\&quot;shea\\&quot; butter from another seller, Nature and Herbs.  What I received was two tubs of a soft, thick, bright yellow substance.  It smelled like shea butter, but the fact that it was bright yellow meant that it had been dyed with a root extract OR was not genuine shea butter at all but rather butter from another kind of tree altogether.  I intended to make lotion bars with the shea butter but I don&#x27;t want bright yellow bars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The KAKOSI brand is the real deal.  It comes sealed in a heavy plastic bag.  It comes in chunks, the way true raw shea butter should.  The color is soft ivory, and the smell is pleasantly nutty.  And you can&#x27;t beat the price - ten dollars for genuine organic raw shea butter.  I purchased this (twice, actually) from the seller ICEMANS THUNDER.  They also have KAKOSI brand organic cocoa butter.</li>
    <li> The packaging was great, very professional. I had to cut it open to scrap a little but it wasn&#x27;t a major deal as far as I can tell. WAS DELIVERED ON.TIME! so  that&#x27;s a plus and I still have a lot left over:) will def. purchase again.</li>
    <li> I ordered this a few days ago thinking, finally a \\&quot;certified\\&quot; organic Shea butter at a decent price. What I received today was a rancid mess, I can still smell the fumes coming from the bag. I will be returning soon and I hope that the next order is fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Seller contacted me and offered to replace the product free of charge. Also, for those wondering the rancid smell was like spoiled salami. Will post another update when I receive the replacement.</li>
    <li> smells great and melts fairly easily.</li>
    <li> It seems to be a good shea butter. It smells a bit like it has been mixed with olive oil though. I mix this with other ingredients to make body butter so it blends in very well.</li>
    <li> This Shea butter isn&#x27;t greasy nor does it have a bad smell. It&#x27;s turned out very well with my oils for my hair . Good price too.</li>
    <li> Just writing in to speak to the Shea butter debate in the reviews. I got three different orders from certified organic sellers. I wouldn&#x27;t imagine ordering anything from Africa uncertified as the chance of wage slavery and abuse is too high for me to justify supporting financially. Our dollar is our vote in a totalitarian economy (&amp;#34;Wendell berry&amp;#34;)...  This is what I want everyone to know. Kakosi, essential depot and mountian rose herbs (not on amazon) all have high quality, genuine, and certified organic product. They are all white colored, not too smelly (all Shea has a smell) and of perfect consistency for moisturizer, sunscreen, and balm for the organic people out there. I&#x27;m just writing to call you folks in to the blessed simplicity of knowing our purchase supports good community and ecology and economy, from the producer all the way through. As we support goodness we get high quality goodness, and that&#x27;s what this Shea butter is. thick Creamy smoothness, with an oppression free product.</li>
    <li> I bought Organic Shea Butter at my local whole foods to compare them. They both smelled the same and reacted the same way on the skin. This one is a bit grainy but I think it&#x27;s because of the way it&#x27;s packaged. I&#x27;m sure if it were melted into a container it&#x27;d have the same smooth texture as the whole foods one. It melted perfectly for my body butters and deodorants. It acts as a great moisturizer for my face but I only apply it at night since it leaves my skin a bit oily. It fantastic for the skin and I would definitely buy it again. Plus it was cheaper than the one I bought in whole foods.</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly with free shipping over $25...product was wonderful with a true shea butter smell &amp; wonderful for our skin...not overly greasy...will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Melts, blends and whips up wonderfully! The scent is pleasant and not overpowering as some of the other kinds I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I love my shea butter! o versatile and moisturizing. Leaves my skin silky and never sticky. My order came in a silver ziplock bag so for ease of use I melted it down in a pot of hot water and poured it into a big jar. I have since made it into body butter, sugar scrub, lotion and use it in place of lip balm. This stuff is silky and smooth. No grains or gritty feeling to it. Smells fresh and pure. I will be buying this stuff for life. So much value. So little is needed to cover your entire body.</li>
    <li> I ordered this and the Organic Cocoa Butter from the same company to make homemade belly butter.  This is my first experience with raw shea butter.  I have used Burt&#x27;s Bees shea butter lotion before and the smell isn&#x27;t great, not bad, but that&#x27;s just how shea smells.  I found this product to have a similar shea butter odor, but it was definitely not overpowering or unpleasant.  The individual chunks were separated in the package, but I did order this in the fall and keep it in a cool, dry cabinet.  To make my lotion I melted equal parts shea, cocoa, and organic coconut oil (which I use for cooking) in a glass bowl over a pot as a double boiler.  Then I let it harden back up some (until my mixer whisk made indentations into it) and whipped it on high for several minutes until it looked like cake frosting.  Then I scooped it into some glass jars.  Great smell to the finished product, more cocoa than anything, I&#x27;m not into adding smelly oils to personal care products.</li>
