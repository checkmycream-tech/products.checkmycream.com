      <li>Effective!</li>
      <li>The directions warn you not to scrub in one spot for more than 2 minutes; I&#x27;ve found it best to keep the scrubbing under 30 seconds instead -</li>

      <li>The appliance is very easy to use.</li>

      <li>As of right now, i am very pleased!</li>
      <li>I follow the instructions exactly, and the system works great.  </li>
      <li>as a first time, though, this was a great experience.</li>
      <li>/&gt;\\&quot;Breakthrough, pre-dosed puffs deliver the perfect degree of gentle exfoliation with ultra-fine crystals and mild</li>
      <li>/&gt;IT is very smooth, and makes yours skin incredible and soft.</li>
      <li>And the paste that comes with it is great, just the right texture, and easy to wash off afterwards.</li>
      <li>I have purchased many items from Amazon</li>
      <li>/&gt;Again, I love using this product and still give it 5 plus stars.  </li>
      <li>i love this product.</li>
      <li>Love the scrub but the on/off button broke on my applicator and it ticked me off.</li>
      <li>It does have a tendency to get into your hairline, so using it prior to your shower would probably be the best idea.</li>
      <li>so you&#x27;ll have to spend more money.  </li>
      <li>The Youthful Essence&#x27;s tool comes with more attachments like the body scubber.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad to say that Neutrogena microdermabrasion is erasing all of the signs of pre-mature aging in just 2 weeks time.  </li>
      <li>I think it helped my moisturizer work better as well.</li>
      <li>br /&gt;Be sure to read the directions and use this system according to your skin type.  </li>
      <li>and I love the results.</li>
      <li>I figure it&#x27;s going to take more than 2 uses to get rid of them.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s all in your technique (which took me many trials to learn) &lt;br</li>
      <li>I have been using the product for years and LOVE it.  </li>
      <li>Just make sure you have a non-soap cleanser to wash your face before you begin, and a good moisturizer to put on afterward right before you get into bed.</li>
      <li>but after my first try 2 weeks ago i LOVED it.</li>
      <li>By the way, I use it on the top of my hands after doing my face, and it leaves them amazingly smooth and more receptive to hand moisturizer.</li>
      <li>It was no problem to rinse it off my face with water, and the sponge was very easy to clean as well.  </li>
      <li>The first week was amazing, I really thought I found something great.  </li>
      <li>I am happy with it so far.  </li>
      <li>(i did it 5 days in a row because i don&#x27;t have sensitive skin), it didn&#x27;t feel as great</li>
      <li>you have particularly sensitive skin, this may not be a great product for you, as it is a bit, well, abrasive.  </li>
      <li>I bought this, loved it and then tried to buy the crystals without buying the whole kit.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s price gouging just because these kits are no longer easy to find.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The Neutrogena Microdermabrasion cream is easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>After using this product the first time, I noticed an incredible new softness to my skin.</li>
      <li>The kit is easy to use and works just fine.</li>
      <li>I researched Cetaphil on the internet and found out that it&#x27;s highly regarded and excellent for sensitive skin.      </li>
      <li>I was very happy with the ease of use and near professional outcome.</li>
      <li>I am in my (very) upper 30&#x27;s and was happy to receive this for Christmas.  </li>
      <li>The sponges are not that easy to clean</li>
      <li>My skin looks and feels fabulous.</li>
      <li>just purchased the Neutrogena Advanced Solutions At Home MicroDermabrasion System for my 50th birthday, and I have to say,</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is available Oct. 10 for a list of $[...],</li>
      <li>this is so easy and quick to use.  </li>
      <li>With a good scrub, I could exfoliate just as well using my bare hands</li>
      <li>Below is my original post from 2006:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I would have gladly paid twice as much for this wonderful little product!</li>
      <li>i finished up the 5 days and while my skin did feel softer than it did before i started this, it wasn&#x27;t silky smooth as it had been after my very first use.</li>
      <li>and they told me it had been discontinued, which was strange because it was amazing!</li>
      <li>Safe and gentle.</li>
      <li>It is good for any facial skin problems, acne scars and all..  </li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t like the paste Neutrogena offers, you can either make your own or buy another brand.  </li>
      <li>Yes my skin feels smooth and yes the vibrating tool is pretty cool</li>
      <li>I go around in QUICK circular motion while applying pressure for 1 minute.</li>
      <li>For me, it was a painless process, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to give their skin a more youthful glow.</li>
      <li>I tried a different one from the beauty supply store and found the cream to have a better, more coarse texture and the motor was more powerful and gave a better \\&quot;wake up\\&quot; to my skin.</li>
      <li>Noticed the difference in my skin texture the very first day I used it.  </li>
      <li>I just used it for the very first time</li>
      <li>Your skin will feel so soft and smooth right after using the system that you may be tempted to not use any moisturizer or lotion afterwards, but make sure you do.  </li>
      <li>, I just got an email from Drugstore.com that there will be a new product from Neutrogena, called \\&quot;Neutrogena Healthy Skin Rejuvenator, The Anti Aging Power Treatment.\\</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 59, have had skin issues all my life (oily areas, dry areas, fair skin, lots of sun) and then added age and all that goes with it skin-wise.    </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have fine lines or large pores.</li>
      <li>The cream in this product works well, with a texture like fine sandpaper - but the applicator really is ineffective.</li>
      <li>Well worth every penny.</li>
      <li>The exfoliation cream worked well, but the tool wasn&#x27;t worth the purchase.</li>
      <li>It is well worth the money.  </li>
      <li>Leaves my skin with a fresh glow, but no redness.  </li>
      <li>To be more clear I must say that I&#x27;m 27</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.and easy to wash off afterwards.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended and easy to integrate into anyone&#x27;s skin care routine.</li>
      <li>It does make your skin softer right after the use</li>
      <li>If your skin is more sensitive, this is probably a better product, but I was looking for a little more abrasion.</li>
      <li>i would definitely buy this product again, but i think i&#x27;ll try other brands first and see which one is best.</li>
      <li>It has done wonders for the large pores on my nose, and the blackheads there have gone away!</li>
      <li>I had a Homedics one that I loved, but it gave out after a month, and a half</li>
      <li>To adequately rinse off the crystals, you really need to splash your face thoroughly.  </li>
      <li>face comes out really fresh, soft and smooth.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I purchased this item at Target several years ago for only $39.00. For perspective, I am in my late thirties and my skin has dulled and I have small wrinkles near my eyes and on my forehead- left over from the late nights of my twenties! It worked great, even after the first treatment (I was surprised, as I have very sensitive, pale skin with redenss from acne scars.) The pad is a thick squishy sponge that is replaceable and the cream has minute crystals in it that remove dead skin without scraping or tearing. Follow the directions, as you do not need to use much of the cream, just dot it on your forehead, cheeks, and chin and scrub away in little circles with light pressure, letting the vibrations of the device do the work (it vibrates and doesn&#x27;t spin.) There will be enough cream left over on your face for your nose and neck. It greatly improved the texture of my skin, which had little dry patches on my forehead and cheek bones. I started using it daily, waited a few days to let my skin regenerate, and then used it approximately every three days before bed. I would not reccomend using it in the morning, as it does leave your skin a bit red after a treatment. Also, make sure you moisterize afterwards, if you don&#x27;t your face will naturally try and provide more oil and you will be very shiney the next day.I think it helped my moisturizer work better as well. After about four months with the scrubby pad (which I washed with warm water after every use and let air dry to remoive the bactteria and dead skin) I was ready for a new one and another jar of the microderm abrasion scrub. I could not find it ANYWHERE. I bought this particular item because it is a name brand and I had seen it at CVS, Target, Wallgreens...all over and figured it would never be hard to find replacement parts. I could not find replacement creams or scrubbers on line either. I e-mailed the company and they told me it had been discontinued, which was strange because it was amazing! They made this similar pink device with a scratchy pad on the end (I tried it and it actually scraped away the skin under my eye and left a scab.) After a year or so I, sadly, threw it out. What a surprise to find, two years later, that the exact same item is for sale on Amazon at nearly four times the price! I think it worked great but I refuse to purchase it again as it appears that it was such a keeper they re-released it at a much higher cost. Great product, but I am very disappointed with Neutogena. I am trying the DermaNew, which is the same idea, much cheaper, and I am not frustrated with the company. I may buy the cream from Nutrogena and use it with the DermaNew device.</li>
    <li> I have now been using this product for almost 2 years, and still love it!  If I don&#x27;t use it at least twice a week, I definitely see a difference in my skn. I get blackheads again on my nose if I don&#x27;t use the product. My only complaint is that Neutrogena repackaged the refills in tubes with only one replacement head in the refill package - it used to be you could buy 2 sponge heads seperately, and one jar of the \\&quot;Facial Resurfacing Cream,\\&quot; but now you have to buy one sponge head together with one smallish tube of cream. At least you can find them everywhere - online at Amazon, or at Wal-Mart, Target, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I just got an email from Drugstore.com that there will be a new product from Neutrogena, called \\&quot;Neutrogena Healthy Skin Rejuvenator, The Anti Aging Power Treatment.\\&quot; It looks the same as the original MicrodDermabrision unit, but the Sponge heads (described as \\&quot;puffs\\&quot;) are pre-filled.  Here is what in part it said:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Breakthrough, pre-dosed puffs deliver the perfect degree of gentle exfoliation with ultra-fine crystals and mild purifiers.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is available Oct. 10 for a list of $[...], less online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I love using this product and still give it 5 plus stars.  Below is my original post from 2006:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just purchased the Neutrogena Advanced Solutions At Home MicroDermabrasion System for my 50th birthday, and I have to say, I am very impressed! It has done wonders for the large pores on my nose, and the blackheads there have gone away! People have always thought I look young for my age, but my skin is already feeling much softer to the touch (I have used it about 4 times so far). I absolutely love it! I would have gladly paid twice as much for this wonderful little product! I was hesitant to buy it at first, since I have sensitive skin, and the instructions say to use it every night the first 5 days or so, but I have used it every other night to sort of \\&quot;break my face in\\&quot; to it.  And the paste that comes with it is great, just the right texture, and easy to wash off afterwards. Although it says after the first week to just use it a couple times a week. I plan to definitely use it as part of my regular beauty routine! I highly recommend this product.and easy to wash off afterwards.

    <li> I asked for and received this item for my 39th birthday, and I can assure you that it works wonderfully.  I have very little sun damage, but the little that I do have is gone.  Mostly, I battle with dull, rough skin and acne, and both of those are almost completely gone as well.  The cream is gentle enough to not irritate my skin, but is definitely strong enough to get real, noticeable results.  I am a registered nurse, and my coworkers and patients are always complimenting me on my skin.  Believe me, before I got this product I never got compliments on my skin.    I follow the instructions exactly, and the system works great.  Your skin will feel so soft and smooth right after using the system that you may be tempted to not use any moisturizer or lotion afterwards, but make sure you do.  If you don&#x27;t, over time your skin may get irritated and patchy, which is certainly counter productive.  It takes me no more than about five (or ten minutes if I&#x27;m doing an \\&quot;intensive\\&quot; session) to do my entire face, neck, and collar bone area.      To adequately rinse off the crystals, you really need to splash your face thoroughly.  I hate doing this over the sink because I get water everywhere, so I use the system first, then jump in the shower and rinse my face while I wash my hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product thinking it would really make scars and lines go away, well, unfortunately, it has only given me more blemishes and small clogged pores that eventually lead to more breakouts. It does make your skin softer right after the use but... i don&#x27;t see any dramatic results. Its a pretty waste of my money and time to go through this though. The interesting part is, it only vibrates and the sponge doesn&#x27;t turn.... i don&#x27;t see how it can create a microdermabrasion. i would not recommend this product at ALL!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been bothered by dry patches on my forehead and cheeks, along with some redness. So when I heard about this little gizmo, it seemed like a good solution. I think I paid about $35.00 locally for it. Anyway, it&#x27;s well designed and has a good, substantial, quality feel. Even the batteries are included. It operates in a very interesting way. It doesn&#x27;t have a rotating head like you&#x27;d expect. It vibrates rapidly. Has 2 speeds.      I followed the directions exactly. Have used it 2 times so far. The parts of my face where there are no dry patches are quite smooth. The dry patches are still there, but are somewhate diminished. I figure it&#x27;s going to take more than 2 uses to get rid of them. The redness has diminished as well. An unexpected bonus, although it might be due to using a new moisturizer after using the appliance. I&#x27;m going to use the device every other day for about 10 days and then switch to three timess per week. The directions say 3x per week, but I think I need extra help!    The appliance is very easy to use. Just be careful and don&#x27;t apply too much pressure. I spent extra time (2 minutes) on the dry patches and one minute everywhere else. When wet according to directions, the pad makes a creamy foam that lubricates the dermabrasion process.     Rinse your face thoroughly afterward (I showered). I actually washed my face using the Cetaphil Gentle Cleansing Bar to make sure I got all the foam and debris off. I followed with Cetaphil Moisturizing Lotion. Very soothing. Give the lotion a minute or two to absorb and you&#x27;re ready to apply makeup. I wear loose powder mineral makeup (Bare Escentuals) and it went on with no problem. I bought the Cetaphil products especially for use with the appliance. I researched Cetaphil on the internet and found out that it&#x27;s highly regarded and excellent for sensitive skin.      This little thing works as advertised! Highly recommended and easy to integrate into anyone&#x27;s skin care routine.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a month and everyone is asking me what am I doing! I am 50, and have seen a visible difference from day one.</li>
    <li> *I had a Homedics one that I loved, but it gave out after a month, and a half so I wanted to replace it. I can no longer find one anywhere so I bought this assuming it worked the same way. Unlike the other microderm system this doesn&#x27;t spin. It just vibrates. It didn&#x27;t do anything my fingertips couldn&#x27;t do. The exfoliation cream worked well, but the tool wasn&#x27;t worth the purchase. It would be unsanitary to return an item like this so I&#x27;ll just take it as a loss.</li>
    <li> Effective! The associated products are also excellent. My skin looks and feels fabulous. I plan to buy one for my girlfriend as a gift.</li>
    <li> why in the world is this product $193 on amazon when you can buy it at the store for $25 dollars, could someone please explain why because i will never pay that much for any product that i brought wayyyyyyyy cheaper at walmart.</li>
    <li> I received this kit for Christmas. I was a little skeptical but after 2 wks my face was smoother and brighter. I had a few comments from co-workers and all-in-all I would recommend this kit to anyone who doesn&#x27;t have the time or the money to visit a spa. It&#x27;s probably the best over-the-counter choice. Easy to use but dries out your skin badly--even when using heavy moisturizer! Biggest complaint: it&#x27;s impossible to travel with. I put the lid on so tightly that we can&#x27;t get it off now but still there was a complete saturation of the bottom of my travel case.</li>
    <li> I bought this product as an impulse buy.  I don&#x27;t have fine lines or large pores. Using this product, I didn&#x27;t see a difference in my skin.  I was trying to soften the sides of my nose.  It&#x27;s a breathing ground for black heads.    I bought this product because I saw the Youthful Essence Informerial on TV.  I wanted the product badly and instead of ordering Youthful Essence, the stores had Neutrogena .  The paste has the same main ingredient, aluminum oxide crystals.    The paste used is gritty as it&#x27;s suppose to be but I didn&#x27;t feel like it was doing anything.  When it was time to wash it off, I had to rub it off, not rinse it off.    Pros:  1. It&#x27;s battery powered, so you can take it wherever you like.  2. The amount of paste is good.  3. If you don&#x27;t like the paste Neutrogena offers, you can either make your own or buy another brand.  You can probably use a facial paste that you use in the shower with microbeads and use it with the scrubber.  That could be a cheaper solution.  4. The scrubber has a stand.  5. Comes with two sponge heads.    Cons:  1. It&#x27;s battery powered, so you&#x27;ll have to replace the batteries.  2. The paste is icky.  3. You cannot use it in the shower or submerge it in water.  4. The sponges are not that easy to clean but it&#x27;s not that hard either.    I haven&#x27;t used Youthful Essence but Neutrogena and Youthful Essence seem like the same product.    To compare them both:    PRICE: Youtful Essence  Neutrogena comes with a tool, 2 sponges, and paste for $40.  Youthful Essence comes with a tool, 2 sponges, the paste, and some extra bonuses (like a facial brush attachment and a body scrubber) for $40.    TOOL: Youthful Essence  Neutrogena&#x27;s tool is not waterproof.  Kit only comes with 2 sponges.  Youthful Essence&#x27;s tool is waterproof now.  I believe it wasn&#x27;t before.  The Youthful Essence&#x27;s tool comes with more attachments like the body scubber.  I believe Neutrogena has a separate tool for the body so you&#x27;ll have to spend more money.  Both are battery-powered.    REFILLS: Neutrogena  Neutrogen&#x27;s paste refill and two sponges, that&#x27;s about $25.  The Youthful Essence&#x27;s website it says a 60-day supply (I don&#x27;t know what that means probably one jar) and 2 sponges for $40.    If the pastes are exactly the same, I couldn&#x27;t find the ingredients to Neutrogena&#x27;s paste on their website.  So if the pastes are exactly the same, I would say buy the Youthful Essence kit and buy the Neutrogena refills.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve never used an at-home microdermabrasion kit before so i can&#x27;t really compare it to others (yet), but after my first try 2 weeks ago i LOVED it. my face felt baby soft like never before. i couldn&#x27;t stop touching my face for 2 days and was shocked everytime by how great it felt. BUT after the 2nd day of using it (i did it 5 days in a row because i don&#x27;t have sensitive skin), it didn&#x27;t feel as great (but i didn&#x27;t break out or anything). i finished up the 5 days and while my skin did feel softer than it did before i started this, it wasn&#x27;t silky smooth as it had been after my very first use. i did notice my blackheads VISIBLY reduced--even the tough ones on my chin. the first time i used it, i just rinsed my face and went to sleep. i didn&#x27;t use any lotion because i have oily skin and the residue from the microdermabrasion cream left my face not dry. the second day, i used my blemish extractor from sephora and the blackheads came out very well and cleansed with murad&#x27;s pomegranate face wash/toner. fyi - if anyone has that extractor, i find that the \\&quot;whitehead\\&quot; loop works better at extracting blackheads than the flat blackhead loop (which scrapes and irritates my skin). anyway, it&#x27;s been 2 weeks and i&#x27;ve been lazy to try it again and my skin is back to square one. i&#x27;m not sure if i&#x27;ll start over with the 5 days in a row thing again or just do it 2 or 3 times a week for \\&quot;maintenance.\\&quot; i&#x27;m thinking (if i have time) of doing microD, extract, then a clay mask or peel. sorry to write a novel, but on a last note i just want to say that even if the effects aren&#x27;t long term, it sure felt great to have the skin of a teenager again (if only for 2 days)! if anything, it&#x27;s the best exfoliator i&#x27;ve ever used... even better than aspirin mask, IMO. i would definitely buy this product again, but i think i&#x27;ll try other brands first and see which one is best. as a first time, though, this was a great experience.</li>
    <li> I have to say that I am not a beauty product user, and have little experience with such products. I spend very little time taking care of my skin, aside from trying to remember to use sunscreen while out on the water all summer. I&#x27;m 59, have had skin issues all my life (oily areas, dry areas, fair skin, lots of sun) and then added age and all that goes with it skin-wise.    On a whim at the grocery store, I bought this product and noticed improvements within 10 days. A month later, I&#x27;m receiving compliments on my skin from old friends. I was astonished at the improvement in my face in all aspects: pore size, texture, bumps, sun related changes. And, best of all, it is easy to use (or else I wouldn&#x27;t be doing it!). Yes, you feel the vibrations but they are minor given the results. I tried in on my nose and had some sneezing episodes, but those passed by the 3rd session. Heck, if at 59 people tell you that they thought you were 45, you can live with it!     I&#x27;m writing this review to share my pleasure with the product. If you knew me, the fact that I&#x27;m writing something as a review, instead of going windsurfing, says a lot!</li>
    <li> This product works very well. I can see difference after using it for 2 times. And the best thing is, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, unlike other facial systems that use steam/scrubs/face brush. Neutrogena MicroDermabrasion System gently exfoliates without leaving undesirable traces on my face - no red spots, no breakouts, no dry flaky skin. I don&#x27;t need to use any special products after the treatment, I only use my regular off-the-rack moisturizer with SPF &amp; I&#x27;m ready to go.</li>
    <li> After reading all of the reviews, i too decided to jump on to the Neutrogena wagon. I just used it for the very first time and i must say i am very impressed so far. My skin is soft just like the product explained it would be after the first session.    I gave one to my sister in-law for her birthday. She has already completed her first week of using the product and she says she has already started to see her skin lighten just a little.     I noticed in some of the reviews that some people complained about the speed. I truely believe that the speed is just right, especially if you have sensitive skin, as i do. We shall see how it turns out as i continue using the product. As of right now, i am very pleased!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about six weeks.  The first week was amazing, I really thought I found something great.  The second week I broke out on the sides of my face... nothing major, just those bumps under your skin but enough to annoy me.    I read some reviews about this happening so I decided to stick with it any way.  The past couple of weeks I&#x27;ve used this product once or twice a week and I still feel like it&#x27;s breaking me out.  I&#x27;m 27, I shouldn&#x27;t have to deal with acne when I&#x27;ve come this far in life w/o acne and it&#x27;s scars.  Yes my skin feels smooth and yes the vibrating tool is pretty cool -- I&#x27;m just wondering when the break-outs will stop.  I change the pads on a regular basis and I even use antibacterial soap to clean them.  I&#x27;ll give it a few more weeks and update this review later.</li>
    <li> Love the scrub but the on/off button broke on my applicator and it ticked me off. Save some $$ and use your own elbow grease to scrub. It works!</li>
    <li> I have to clarify this is NOT THE SAME as YOUTHFUL ESSENCE. &lt;br /&gt;IT does NOT work the same and the product is NOT the same.  I MUST clarity that...  I dont want to confuse anyone here. &lt;br /&gt;Youthful Essence for instance is NOT pasty or harsh, or gritty. &lt;br /&gt;IT is very smooth, and makes yours skin incredible and soft.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s all in your technique (which took me many trials to learn) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you have had professional microdermabrassion then you will know how much scrubbing and pressure you will need to apply on your face. The crystals are abrasive and if you do not have the proper techniques you will hurt your face. I use the crystals in pure form ONCE a week (without the vibrating mechanism) BEFORE BEDTIME. These are the steps I do that WORK FOR ME. You may have a different system that might WORK FOR YOU. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1. Thoroughly wash face with cleanser (I use Neutrogena facial liquid soap) and rinse well. &lt;br /&gt;2. While still damp, I use crystals to thoroughly exfoliate my face avoiding eye area. I go around in QUICK circular motion while applying pressure for 1 minute. &lt;br /&gt;3. I rinse quickly and use Neutrogena Deep Clean Cream Cleanser to get all the crystals out since crystals are difficult to get out(it is also soothing). &lt;br /&gt;4. (Its not over yet) After patting my face dry I follow up by using Neutrogena Pore Refining Mask. It&#x27;s a cooling gel that you keep on for 5 mins to tighten pores. Rinse off and pat dry. &lt;br /&gt;5. I do not put anything else on my face before sleeping. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My face comes out really fresh, soft and smooth. The next morning I just use the cream cleanser to wash. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 10 months and I must say that nothing improved the appearance of my skin like this product. I followed the instructions on the box and after the first week I started using it only once a week. It&#x27;s a real pleasure to notice how soft, clear and hydrated my skin gets with every use.   To be more clear I must say that I&#x27;m 27 and I have combination skin. I use the MicroDermabrasion System always in the morning after washing my face with my regular face soap.  I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to improve the overall condition of their skin.</li>
    <li> I used the product but was not impressed with the speed of the motor. I tried a different one from the beauty supply store and found the cream to have a better, more coarse texture and the motor was more powerful and gave a better \\&quot;wake up\\&quot; to my skin. If your skin is more sensitive, this is probably a better product, but I was looking for a little more abrasion.</li>
    <li> I got a microdermabrasion done at a clinic and then bought this product to maintain the results at home. I was very happy with the ease of use and near professional outcome. If you follow the instructions, you WILL see a difference.     My only complaint is that you can no longer get the soft foam replacement heads (except along with the cream - which I don&#x27;t need right now).     One caveat: do please be careful with the cream - it seems to like getting into the eyes and that can be a yucky feeling, and downright dangerous if you don&#x27;t manage to flush out all the particles.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product.  I am a late 30&#x27;s woman whose skin is basically pretty good.  I have occasional mild breakouts and some blackheads, but even before I bought the Neutrogena microdermabrasion I would receive compliments on how smooth my skin is. But around age 35 I looked in the mirror and realized my skin was getting that middle-age dullness to it.  Unwilling to pay for a professional microdermabrasion, I decided to try the Neutrogena at home system.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Neutrogena Microdermabrasion cream is easy to apply.  The cream had the slightest pleasant smell, and was not sticky at all.  I used well less than a teaspoon, so a little goes a long way.  It was no problem to rinse it off my face with water, and the sponge was very easy to clean as well.  The treatment took me less than 10 minutes, fit in easily to my bedtime routine, and after the initial start-up treatments you only need to do it a couple times a week. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My skin definitely felt softer, smoother and more invigorated.  I could notice a difference after only one treatment.  But the real proof came from the way my husband did a double take a couple days later and commented that I looked younger.  (He didn&#x27;t know about the microdermabrasion.)  And even my 6 year old daughter told me my face looked pretty.  There was a clear and noticeable difference--after only a few treatments my middle-aged dull skin had definitely gotten back some of its youthful glow, and the few large pores I have did appear smaller. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Being lazy, I have not incorporated it into my regular routine like I should, but I do pull it out a few days before special occasions, vacations, or anytime I feel the need for a little brightening up, and will definitely always keep it on hand. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you have particularly sensitive skin, this may not be a great product for you, as it is a bit, well, abrasive.  For me, it was a painless process, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to give their skin a more youthful glow.</li>
    <li> I am in my (very) upper 30&#x27;s and was happy to receive this for Christmas.  Since my facial skin is a bit sensitive, I followed the \\&quot;sensitive skin directions\\&quot; and used it every other day to start off.  I really like the way it has helped my skin.  It&#x27;s softer and smoother, particularly the morning after I use it.  I&#x27;ve had no problem rinsing the cleanser off.  Just splash with lukewarm water until it&#x27;s rinsed away.  Any residue can be removed with a wet cotton ball or toner on a cotton ball.  Rinsing the cleansing pad is simple as well. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Be sure to read the directions and use this system according to your skin type.  Moisturize afterward and use a sunscreen the next day as well.  The directions warn you not to scrub in one spot for more than 2 minutes; I&#x27;ve found it best to keep the scrubbing under 30 seconds instead - that&#x27;s plenty.</li>
    <li> I am 49 and just starting to get a few wrinkles &amp; dry skin.  This system doesn&#x27;t hurt, just tickles especially around the nose area.  Leaves my skin with a fresh glow, but no redness.  Skin feels very soft after treatment, and it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now, but don&#x27;t see any difference in my few wrinkles, but I guess it&#x27;s not a miracle cure for wrinkles!!  All in all I would recommend this MicroDermabrasion system to others.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful and I keep it in my shower to use every 3 days.  I recommend it to all my friends.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for years and LOVE it.  For those of you who think you can&#x27;t get a refill on the sponge and cream, Wal Mart has a kit for around $17, by Neutrogena, with a sponge and tube of the refill cream.   Just for your information.</li>
    <li> this is so easy and quick to use.  after your 1st use, your face feels baby soft and looks refreshed.  i love this product.</li>
    <li> &lt;br /&gt;It really does work. No breakouts. No irritation to my skin. Safe and gentle.</li>
    <li> The cream in this product works well, with a texture like fine sandpaper - but the applicator really is ineffective. It basically vibrates, and you use circular motions to apply the cream.  I can pretty much get the same effect using the cream and my fingertips. I also found it hard to rinse the grittiness off afterwards - no matter how much I splashed my face. It does have a tendency to get into your hairline, so using it prior to your shower would probably be the best idea. That would also help in the removal of the cream after the treatment and less mess around the sink from all the extra splashing. A washcloth does work, but as a rule, I try to avoid using washcloths on my face - they harbor too much bacteria, and with breakout prone skin, I don&#x27;t need any help in that area.     Overall, not a bad product, just not a great one. However, for an at home treatment, and one that&#x27;s relatively inexpensive, it&#x27;s not a bad purchase.</li>
    <li> After using this product the first time, I noticed an incredible new softness to my skin. I&#x27;m on my third day of the five recommended at start-up and am truly pleased with the results. My skin is smoother, softer and brighter. It takes so little time at the end of the evening, and it&#x27;s so worth it! Just make sure you have a non-soap cleanser to wash your face before you begin, and a good moisturizer to put on afterward right before you get into bed. That&#x27;s all you need. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great service by the seller, and, of course, this is a wonderful product for a facial skin rejuvenation. By the way, I use it on the top of my hands after doing my face, and it leaves them amazingly smooth and more receptive to hand moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This product works beautifully. I have had it for a few years. The cream that is sold with it made my face break out so I use it with my exfoliating cleanser and I love the results. Every time I start to see the parentheses around my mouth make an appearance I use this to make them disappear. Well worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I bought this, loved it and then tried to buy the crystals without buying the whole kit.  I can&#x27;t find them anywhere!  Makes it a very pricey little beauty tool</li>
    <li> I paid just about under 30.00 for this product. It&#x27;s great! Just hard to find the crystal cream solution. When I run out, I&#x27;m going to ulta to find a similar type of crystal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, this is good but NOT worth paying the ridiculous 165 price tag! Seriously? That&#x27;s price gouging just because these kits are no longer easy to find. I would not pay over 40...I&#x27;d use a face scrub instead. There is something disheartening to see someone raise a 30.00 product to over 165.00 &gt;_&amp;lt;</li>
    <li> this product makes me dizzy because of the vibration it does.. i guess this isnt for me. at some point i use it,but turned the power off..my boys used it too,but it only give them more blemish...also this seller is ripping off anyone who will buy from them.. amazon is only selling this when i got this last year for only $15.99! and here with this seller? its $150?! hello! you must have mis-typed your pricing there!</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a gift for my daughter, she is happy with it, so I am sure it is a good product.  I bought it for the name and reputation.</li>
    <li> It seemed everyone raved about this version from Neutrogena because of the exfoliation cream which is now difficult to find.  If you still have this one KEEP IT!!! The new version uses microdermabrasion puffs instead of the aluminum crystals which were deemed unsafe. The refill puffs have an applicator head that fits this one AND they are less than EIGHTEEN BUCKS for 2 months worth; and even cheaper on Amazon Subscribe and Save ;) The New Microdermabrasion System Kit is around TWENTY BUCKS.  Alas, the newer version kits don&#x27;t include the counter stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you really like the foam applicators and exfoliation crystal cream Earth Therapeutics line is also compatible and fits too.  Just explore ALL your Microdermabrasion options on your skincare journey.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe I ever wasted money on this thing. I used it twice and ended up donating it to Goodwill. I didn&#x27;t particularly care for the scent of the cleanser and found it labor intensive to use, the product also lacks a timer to let you know when to move on to another part of your face (like the clarisonic does). Granted this product is considerably cheaper but you get what you pay for. As another reviewer noted it only vibrates, and I felt a little dizzy using it.</li>
    <li> I work outdoors in sunny Florida and my skin takes a beating.  I had brown spots, dry skin and lines forming.  I&#x27;m glad to say that Neutrogena microdermabrasion is erasing all of the signs of pre-mature aging in just 2 weeks time.  It is well worth the money.  Just don&#x27;t get it in your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriend told me about this and I wasn&#x27;t really to keen on trying it, but I did anyway.  Guys and girls this system works and clears up all kinds of skin problems.  It is good for any facial skin problems, acne scars and all..  I recommend it to any one who has any type of skin problems.</li>
    <li> Noticed the difference in my skin texture the very first day I used it.  My skin has ever since been soft and radiant.</li>
    <li> The kit is easy to use and works just fine. I was disappointed that the foam head didn&#x27;t spin - it just vibrates. With a good scrub, I could exfoliate just as well using my bare hands but now that I already have it, I&#x27;ll use it.   For the price, I might not recommend buying it. If it were $15 or $20, it might be a nice thing to have.</li>
    <li> I received my product in a timely matter.  I am happy with it so far.  I&#x27;m hoping to have great results within a month.</li>
    <li> This item was purchased as a Christmas gift.  After ordering the item, I found the same item on ebay for one fourth of the price ($50 vs $200).  The ebay item was new.  When a return was requested, the company declined due to the item being a health care product even though it was in the same condition (damaged box) that it came in and the box had not been opened.  I have purchased many items from Amazon and I have never been disappointed before this event.  Normally I would not check ebay but in the future you can be assured that I will.</li>
