<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It works great to tame the frizzys.</li>
    <li> Works very good on Course texture hair</li>
    <li> It certainly worked better than the other gel products that I&#x27;ve tried. It last longer too. I need something to last all day however. This has been the best product so far though.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.</li>
    <li> Keeps hair I place, not greasy. Love it.</li>
    <li> Edge Control really works. It leaves the hair soft, smooth and in place without a lot of oily residue.  This is the only product I use now.</li>
    <li> I will not be wasting my money on edge controlling products that do not work. There has got to be something out there for Black women who wear their hair natural, and want there edges to lay down without the white residue, and dull look. Can anyone recommend something? Please leave feedback here for me. Thanks!</li>
    <li> The Best ever don&#x27;t leave. Hair white or hard</li>
    <li> I liked this edge control for straight styles. I&#x27;m natural and when my hair reverts this just soaks right into my hair so I&#x27;ll save this for when i flat iron every three months. I love the smell by the way.</li>
    <li> Small amounts of the products work well. Not too sticky.  I would buy this product again.  Works on natural hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fantastic gel. It, holds down, the most stubborn edges, without flaking. Love it, will buy again! Great site to order from.</li>
    <li> Great shine, medium hold, but does give flaky residue</li>
    <li> Great product, not to be used everyday.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!  My edges lay realy smooth, even and greaseless!!  Love this!</li>
    <li> Product took my rough edges and made them smooth as silk.</li>
    <li> Very good. Acts the same wsy as when my stylist uses it on me.</li>
    <li> It adds control without the hard or slick look, very natural edge control!!  i changed my star rating because this is an extreme light hold. i have 3b curls and am curly as soon as i walk outside in humid Houston. Good for light hold but i&#x27;m looking for something a bit more strong than this.</li>
    <li> (I am AA with thick relaxed hair) I discovered this product just in time...I went from shoulder length hair to VERY short close cropped cut. This product helps to keep the back flat without any caking, flaking or build up. A little goes a long way with this product! I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Did not work good for me</li>
    <li> The best edge control out there. Does not make hair hard. Actually holds in place while moisturizing hair. Love the slick wet look.</li>
    <li> I have tried many of the edge control products. This one works great! I have fuzzy hair that tries to curl up and it doesn&#x27;t with this product.</li>
    <li> Great for my edges. No flaking. No white residue. Clean and light. Another staple for my natural hair care products. BTW, I have a fine grade of hair that&#x27;s natural and it doesn&#x27;t take much to manipulate it since it&#x27;s finer.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a miracle! I am natural haired, but I do use clip in extentions. When I flat iron my hair the edges can look a little rough trying to blend with my extentions and this stuff makes it all come together! A little goes a long way, and will have your hair on point!</li>
    <li> I use this on my daughter who doesn&#x27;t have a relaxer and it lasts for more than a day. Glad I purchased it after seeing it used in a YouTube video</li>
    <li> Best edge control I have used so far. Most edge controls like (Olive Oil and Creme of Nature) build up when using it daily. I had no issues with that. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair flake or greasy after applying it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold as well as it claims</li>
