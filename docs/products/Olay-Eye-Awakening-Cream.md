      <li>Maybe it is just sitting on top of my skin</li>
      <li>It feels really refreshing and opens my eyes.</li>
      <li>and that&#x27;s pretty good for the price.  </li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s better than a strong odor).</li>
      <li>I am 30, takes great care of my skin, eats healthy on most days and use SPF daily even on my make-up.  </li>
      <li>It does nothing for fine lines.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s use for me was to diminish fine lines and hydrate the eye area.  </li>
      <li>use it day and night and makes my eye areas plump and smooth.</li>
      <li>makes your eyes calm from swelling and look more awake..</li>
      <li>Pretty happy with this so far.</li>
      <li>me, this stuff really does brighten my under eye skin and it smells pretty good as well</li>
      <li>Beyond moisturizing, i didn&#x27;t feel anything special.</li>
      <li>I just got on line to buy a few more tubes of this amazing product!  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s just a good eye moisturizer for the day even though it doesn&#x27;t have SPF or actual anti aging effects.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to love this product too.</li>
      <li>When I bought this product I was encouraged that it would actually work by the good ratings it had received.  </li>
      <li>Not oily and absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>I think the action of the roller ball applicator does more good then the actually ingredients.  </li>
      <li>it really works!!</li>
      <li>I love these to carry in my purse for those days when I&#x27;m over-tired(far too frequently) and my eyes could use some rejuvenating!  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t notice a huge difference in my dark circles, but it smells nice and feels cooling.</li>
      <li>It also helps tighten the skin and reduce any wrinkles, I am lucky not to really have any wrinkles yet although my Mom told me it help ease hers (she&#x27;s in her 50s).  </li>
      <li>Most days I don&#x27;t even need to do that because this actually brightens my skin too.  </li>
      <li>I AM in my fifties and what&#x27;s funny is..</li>
      <li>The entire description of the product seems to point that this will feel refreshing under your eyes...</li>

      <li>But if its not, it doesn&#x27;t really make puffiness go away.</li>

      <li>The texture of this product feels good through, its very creamy, and thick, so you dont need a lot.</li>
      <li>I have always been satisfied with OIay with the other products that I have tried.  </li>
      <li>Love this eyecream feels nice and cold when you apply it.</li>
      <li>Speaking of which, the better way to release the cream is to slightly press on the tube and then apply it with the tube to your skin (vs. pressing the tube to your skin and then squeezing which might be too pressure/cream).  </li>
      <li>I have been using it for about 2 weeks or more, so far i have not seen a difference with my dark circles.</li>
      <li>like some kind of minty product, but in reality the only &amp;#34;cool feeling&amp;#34; is from the little balls that help release/massage the cream to your skin.  </li>
      <li>was needing new cleansers and moisturizers and found this product-</li>
      <li>I really wish they would give your enough time to fully test these products before wanting a review.</li>
      <li>tired!&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, there is something in the formula that I am sensitive to</li>
      <li>especially if you have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>okay, I think it does brighten my tired eyes.</li>
      <li>The previous reviewer was right on.. especially writing about her mother.  </li>
      <li>I have only used this product for a week or two, so that isn&#x27;t long enough to really tell if I will have that problem yet.  </li>
      <li>I noticed after the first use that my under eyes were lighter and puffier (not in a bad way, the cream just seems to have lifted or thickened my skin which I love).</li>

<li> The reason I gave this product a 4 instead of a 5 is that I have not had the opportunity to evaluate it long enough.  </li>
<li> Maybe i haven&#x27;t used this long enough to tell?</li>
<li> It was marked down to about $12</li>
<li> cools dark eyes very quickly but has had small results in removing or lightening the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
<li> Using this every morning for a week now and the tri-roller ball massager helps reduce puffiness in the morning especially if had a long night or ate some salty dinner!  </li>
<li> My left eye even looked a bit as if I&#x27;d been punched, with a dark smudge underneath.  </li>
<li> Bought it at Target for 12 dollars, same price as L&#x27;oreal eye cream in a little jar that I used at night.  </li>
<li> You only need a little.</li>
<li> I apply it a little bit lower than my lower lid, because if you do a &amp;#34;triangle&amp;#34; from the inner and outer corners of lower lids to the nose, (eye concealer trick too!)</li>
<li> Unfortunately, in my experience the results were pretty minimal.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used other products in this line</li>
<li> I do not have puffiness or dark circles</li>
<li> i dont know if i can say that it makes dark circles brighter or disappear.</li>
<li> My eyes also do seem to be less dark underneath, so that says something.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used half of the tube already.  </li>
<li> It seems to help a little with puffiness and dark circles.</li>
<li> a little spendy for so-so results.</li>
<li> I look a little weathered.  </li>
<li> My eyelids get dried out.  </li>
<li> , i dont use it everyday because i haven&#x27;t had the need to, but</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t notice a huge difference in my dark circles, but it smells nice and feels cooling. I like the roller ball applicator.</li>
    <li> This product works just as well as some of the more expensive brands I have tried.  I would say it doesn&#x27;t brighten under your eyes !00%, but it does something to help the overall appearance of darkness. Maybe more like a 40% improvement and that&#x27;s pretty good for the price.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to cause irritation to the skin either.  I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> This is better eye product and more visually effective than any eye cream I&#x27;ve used and I&#x27;ve used a lot.  Great price too!😁</li>
    <li> This works wonders. .I use it day and night and makes my eye areas plump and smooth.</li>
    <li> I really like this product and keep it in the refrigerator.  I use it in the morning while I am having my coffee before I put my makeup on for work.  It feels really refreshing and opens my eyes.</li>
    <li> Good refreshing and hydrating product! Not oily and absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> It feels refreshing to use in the morning before putting on makeup but yeah... it&#x27;s just a good eye moisturizer for the day even though it doesn&#x27;t have SPF or actual anti aging effects. I like how it&#x27;s not greasy. It&#x27;s sliiiightly tacky (in a really good way) so I like that for my eye makeup. It&#x27;s not tacky where it&#x27;s annoying, but just in comparison to a really moisturizing moisturizer where it&#x27;s slightly slippery. I&#x27;m 18 so I don&#x27;t need an eye moisturizer that&#x27;s crazy on hydration but for now it will do. Any moisturizer is better than none when it comes to anti aging stuff.</li>
    <li> love this stuff..it really works!! makes your eyes calm from swelling and look more awake..</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t last longer than a month. The consistency changed had to throw it out. I&#x27;ve used other products in this line never seen that problem before. But the month it did work it worked wonderfully</li>
    <li> Using this every morning for a week now and the tri-roller ball massager helps reduce puffiness in the morning especially if had a long night or ate some salty dinner!  It has white tea, honeysuckle, and cucumber extracts.  I am 30, takes great care of my skin, eats healthy on most days and use SPF daily even on my make-up.  This eye cream does not irritate my skin and I still use my ring finger to massage the cream around my eyes and eye brow.  It also helps tighten the skin and reduce any wrinkles, I am lucky not to really have any wrinkles yet although my Mom told me it help ease hers (she&#x27;s in her 50s).  I let this sit for a couple of minutes to my skin can absorb the cream before I put on any concealer under my eye.  Most days I don&#x27;t even need to do that because this actually brightens my skin too.  Price is good, cheaper than most department store products. Bought it at Target for 12 dollars, same price as L&#x27;oreal eye cream in a little jar that I used at night.  It also fits perfect in my purse and I reapply in the afternoon if need a quick freshening up.</li>
    <li> I just got on line to buy a few more tubes of this amazing product!  The previous reviewer was right on.. especially writing about her mother.  I AM in my fifties and what&#x27;s funny is..I use a magnifying mirror to put on my eye makeup and had been noticing my crinkles between brow and lid seemed smoother...it finally dawned on me it was this cream..that is what prompted me (of course!) to buy more!!!  It is great!!!</li>
    <li> I use a lot of Alay products and they are normally good  products. But this eye crème didn&#x27;t really do anything&lt;br /&gt;for me.  I take a lot of medications and sometimes (sometimes?) I look a little weathered.  Thought this might&lt;br /&gt;help.</li>
    <li> The reason I gave this product a 4 instead of a 5 is that I have not had the opportunity to evaluate it long enough.  I have a problem with excema sometimes with products and have not had that problem yet.  I have only used this product for a week or two, so that isn&#x27;t long enough to really tell if I will have that problem yet.  I have always been satisfied with OIay with the other products that I have tried.  I do know that this cream feels really good after applying it around my eyes.  My eyes also do seem to be less dark underneath, so that says something. I really wish they would give your enough time to fully test these products before wanting a review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used half of the tube already.  I use it day and night.  I had hopes for this because it is inexpensive. It&#x27;s use for me was to diminish fine lines and hydrate the eye area.  I do not have puffiness or dark circles so I can&#x27;t comment on those aspects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: I do like the packaging.  It doesn&#x27;t have a scent. It does feel cooling... for a couple of seconds.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: After about 1 hours, the moisture benefit is gone.  My eyelids get dried out.  It does nothing for fine lines.</li>
    <li> The entire description of the product seems to point that this will feel refreshing under your eyes... like some kind of minty product, but in reality the only &amp;#34;cool feeling&amp;#34; is from the little balls that help release/massage the cream to your skin.  Speaking of which, the better way to release the cream is to slightly press on the tube and then apply it with the tube to your skin (vs. pressing the tube to your skin and then squeezing which might be too pressure/cream).  Beyond moisturizing, i didn&#x27;t feel anything special.</li>
    <li> Pretty happy with this so far. I&#x27;ve been using it morning and night and I really like the cooling effect when applying. I&#x27;ve noticed a reduction in my under eye circles and puffiness after only a week of using. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> When I bought this product I was encouraged that it would actually work by the good ratings it had received.  Unfortunately, in my experience the results were pretty minimal.  And I am concerned about massaging the delicate under-eye tissue with the metal balls in the applicator for 30 seconds.  So it didn&#x27;t work out for me.</li>
    <li> I had been hesitant to ever buy under eye cream, because it is very expensive and I always thought the stuff would never actually work. I am 20 but I have very thin skin under my eyes, I don&#x27;t get enough sleep or hydrate well enough, and I try to cover this problem with make up (doesn&#x27;t work, just cakes and I end up wiping it away).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was needing new cleansers and moisturizers and found this product-the package was what drew me in. It was marked down to about $12 so I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot. This stuff is GREAT! I noticed after the first use that my under eyes were lighter and puffier (not in a bad way, the cream just seems to have lifted or thickened my skin which I love). Maybe it is just sitting on top of my skin but I don&#x27;t really care, because I can&#x27;t feel it  and it doesn&#x27;t look like I am wearing anything. I was able to go without putting make up or concealer under my eyes because this stuff did the trick and I only re-applied it once throughout the day (because I was nervous about not having on concealer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, this stuff really does brighten my under eye skin and it smells pretty good as well (there isn&#x27;t too much of a scent but that&#x27;s better than a strong odor). I would give it a shot because its cheaper than most products but does a great job!</li>
    <li> cools dark eyes very quickly but has had small results in removing or lightening the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how i expectably feel about this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for a while now, i dont use it everyday because i haven&#x27;t had the need to, but i dont know if i can say that it makes dark circles brighter or disappear. I have puffiness on my lower lid, but i also have big eyes to begin with, so maybe its just my bottom lid molding its form around my eye? But if its not, it doesn&#x27;t really make puffiness go away. The texture of this product feels good through, its very creamy, and thick, so you dont need a lot. I apply it a little bit lower than my lower lid, because if you do a &amp;#34;triangle&amp;#34; from the inner and outer corners of lower lids to the nose, (eye concealer trick too!) then its supposed to erase puffiness and all that. Maybe i haven&#x27;t used this long enough to tell? I really wanted to love this product too.</li>
    <li> I have a colicky baby and neither of us has slept more than 1-2 hours at a time in over 4 months, so I was a great candidate this product. I really wanted this to work, but it didn&#x27;t and I look just as tired as I am.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the way it made my eyes feel. There was sought of a sticky feeling.</li>
    <li> Great for under the eyes. They feel moisturized throughout the day.</li>
    <li> disappointing. do not see a difference in my eyes. goes in white and does not always blend in. will not repurchase</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed a difference</li>
    <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know if any of these sorts of cremes work, but I like it. The skin around my eyes stays moist without being oily and I feel like it looks brighter. You only need a little.</li>
    <li> I generally don&#x27;t buy special eye products because of the expense, but I loved the packaging on this one with the cute little roller balls in a little tube that was so purse friendly...but after one day of use (morning and then again at night) I awoke to puffy uncomfortable eyes.  My left eye even looked a bit as if I&#x27;d been punched, with a dark smudge underneath.  At best, it made me look deathly tired!&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, there is something in the formula that I am sensitive to and I had to throw it away (what a waste of money!)  I wanted to love this product, but it&#x27;s not for me.  Just a warning to those trying it the first time - especially if you have sensitive skin like I do - you may not be able to tolerate it.</li>
    <li> I like it for the gentle massage it gives as you apply it. It seems to help a little with puffiness and dark circles.</li>
    <li> product works ok.  I think the action of the roller ball applicator does more good then the actually ingredients.  a little spendy for so-so results.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for about 2 weeks or more, so far i have not seen a difference with my dark circles. IT does give you a nice massage when you roll it over your eyes, and the cooling effect is nice, but i don&#x27;t see a difference</li>
    <li> Works okay, I think it does brighten my tired eyes.</li>
    <li> Does not work as well as another brand I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I was really disappointed in this product. Did not work for me at all. I might as well flushed the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only gave it 2 stars because it smelled nice and it didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> REFRESHING UNDER EYE CREAM APPLIED BY A ROLLER.  AAA+++</li>
    <li> I love these to carry in my purse for those days when I&#x27;m over-tired(far too frequently) and my eyes could use some rejuvenating!  I&#x27;m disappointed it&#x27;s being discontinued.</li>
    <li> Love this eyecream feels nice and cold when you apply it. I believe it does make a bit of a difference I feel my bags being &amp;#34;Awaken&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> love ALL Olay products!</li>
    <li> Very refreshing! . Love it!</li>
