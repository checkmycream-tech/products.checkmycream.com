      <li>The best discovery Ever</li>
      <li>Perfect for my nose hairs.</li>
      <li>Works great, hurts quite a bit pulling hair from you nose!  </li>
      <li>I was really impressed with how this worked.  </li>
      <li>My hair problem in my nose has disappeared and the blackheads I was dealing with have been lifted out and my skn looks great.</li>
      <li>Great purchase</li>
      <li>Works great..</li>
      <li>This is great for removing nose hair.</li>
      <li>Good applicator.</li>
      <li>The applicator for the nose wasn&#x27;t that good.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>The wax smells amazing too.</li>
      <li>Super easy and did a very nice job removing hair from inside my nice.  </li>
      <li>I had best success heating it in a pan of hot water.</li>
      <li>This is great if you take care and not  pull out too much nose hair....</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
      <li>Of course everyone will tell you Oh those hairs serve a purpose, but somehow ripping them all out is more psychologically rewarding than worrying about whether I&#x27;m going to inhale some particle of dust.</li>
      <li>if so I would so order more</li>
      <li>have more wax then the tools to pill hair</li>
      <li>Ended up using the Popsicle sticks which worked much better.</li>
      <li>( If interested, I find that the best way to avoid any pain is when the wait time is up, just yank really fast.)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very good and do the work without any pain  ,, just I hope if the container was bigger .&lt;br /&gt;Nora</li>
      <li>Extremely easy to apply and remove.&lt;br /&gt;Used</li>
      <li>Just make sure NOT to put too much on the wand</li>
      <li>Yes it will hurt some...but honestly not as bad as I thought it would..</li>
      <li>Easy to use and very helpful.  </li>
      <li>Takes awhile to get it right.</li>
      <li>I actually found that the popscicle stick like applicators worked better.</li>
      <li>I bought the kit for in the first place.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I need.</li>
      <li>The product shipped quickly, price was right, but unless you&#x27;re a sadist steer clear.  </li>
      <li>This works fine, but I suggest you use wooden sticks to get a bit deeper.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>This product works really well.</li>
      <li>and I really do like the concept of it.</li>
      <li>FAST SHIPPER QUALITY PRODUCT</li>
      <li>I am OCD about nose hair, and much to my surprise I can do this without sneezing or tearing up.  </li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>BUT the other is so way better</li>
      <li>At first I was VERY skeptical about purchasing this item, was kind of nervous!!  </li>
      <li>you can reuse the applicators..but keeping some really icy water near..and once used..place in ice and the wax becomes very brittle and will break off the applicator easily.</li>
      <li>If your careful and only get the ones closest to the outer nostril it really keeps things neat and tidy.  </li>
      <li>I will most likely continue to purchase this, unless another depilatory company comes out with an improved version of a similar kit.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Proper technique and following directions exactly for warming the wax so not to get too hot</li>
      <li>Squeeze a little around outside to make sure the hair in the front of your nose gets in the wax and let it sit about 90 seconds.  </li>
      <li>Also instructions says 2 mins in microwave for a full bowl of wax, 1 min 30 sec for 75% of wax left in bowl and so on...</li>
      <li>Bought some wax in our local drug store and it didn&#x27;t work nearly as well as this product.  </li>
      <li>Does a good job, but a little on the expensive side for what you get.</li>

<li> Proper technique and following directions exactly for warming the wax so not to get too hot</li>

<li> Does a good job, but a little on the expensive side for what you get.</li>
<li> Next, wiggle it a bit and loosen any wax that touched the outside of your nostril, then with a firm steady twist, pull the applicator out.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s NOT like tweezing a single hair.  </li>
<li> Well I have half left but still had to heat it up for 3 minutes.</li>
<li> I ended up using all of them in one single use!</li>
<li> I was a little scared to try wax, especially inside of my nose.</li>
<li> Does not hurt hardly at all, I use it about once a month and it keeps the hair gone and makes it easier to keep clear.</li>
<li> and I am definitively growing less hairs each</li>
<li> Not better than other brands.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a messy process</li>
<li> It was my mistake, I should have read the instructions :/</li>
<li> Maybe it just takes some placement practice, I&#x27;m not sure; but the kit does work</li>
<li> rating because this kit is much less painful than the old fashioned pull-one-hair-out-at-a-time technique I&#x27;m used to.</li>
<li> The number of sticks provided is ridiculous!</li>
<li> A little painful to use, but I will tell you that it removed all nose hair</li>
<li> This stuff hurts and hurts bad:-(</li>
<li> Awful product.</li>

    <li> Takes longer to microwave than stated</li>
    <li> The number of sticks provided is ridiculous! I ended up using all of them in one single use! Awful product.</li>
    <li> Super easy and did a very nice job removing hair from inside my nice.  I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> This works fine, but I suggest you use wooden sticks to get a bit deeper. Use the plastic foldout of the mustaches to block your moustache hair. I didn&#x27;t do this and had to shave and start over. It was my mistake, I should have read the instructions :/</li>
    <li> At first I was VERY skeptical about purchasing this item, was kind of nervous!!  Item came on time and in one piece.  Easy to use and very helpful.  Just make sure NOT to put too much on the wand bc i made that mistake ONCE and the wax was dripping everywhere. Great purchase</li>
    <li> The applicator for the nose wasn&#x27;t that good. Ended up using the Popsicle sticks which worked much better. The wax smells amazing too.</li>
    <li> A little painful to use, but I will tell you that it removed all nose hair and I can go weeks between trimming. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Perfect for my nose hairs. Extremely easy to apply and remove.&lt;br /&gt;Used it 5 times now and I am definitively growing less hairs each time.&lt;br /&gt;I microwave the used sticks to remove was an hairs and reuse, it works.</li>
    <li> Bought some wax in our local drug store and it didn&#x27;t work nearly as well as this product.  My hair problem in my nose has disappeared and the blackheads I was dealing with have been lifted out and my skn looks great.</li>
    <li> This product works really well. I found it to be basically painless. The box includes some applicators and also some wooden spatulas that are basically popscicle sticks. I actually found that the popscicle stick like applicators worked better. And there is LOTS of wax in the jar. I bet there is probably enough for about 6 applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions say to heat the wax in a microwave. I had best success heating it in a pan of hot water.</li>
    <li> Works great.. Takes awhile to get it right. Also instructions says 2 mins in microwave for a full bowl of wax, 1 min 30 sec for 75% of wax left in bowl and so on... Well I have half left but still had to heat it up for 3 minutes.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good and do the work without any pain  ,, just I hope if the container was bigger .&lt;br /&gt;Nora</li>
    <li> I was really impressed with how this worked.  I am OCD about nose hair, and much to my surprise I can do this without sneezing or tearing up.  It&#x27;s NOT like tweezing a single hair.  Melt the wax, dip the applicator head and stick it up in your nose.  Squeeze a little around outside to make sure the hair in the front of your nose gets in the wax and let it sit about 90 seconds.  Next, wiggle it a bit and loosen any wax that touched the outside of your nostril, then with a firm steady twist, pull the applicator out.  Don&#x27;t yank!  Just pull decisively.  You&#x27;ll see dozens of hairs stuck in the wax pulled out with their root bulb.  Of course everyone will tell you Oh those hairs serve a purpose, but somehow ripping them all out is more psychologically rewarding than worrying about whether I&#x27;m going to inhale some particle of dust.</li>
    <li> Does a good job, but a little on the expensive side for what you get.</li>
    <li> The best discovery Ever</li>
    <li> Works great, hurts quite a bit pulling hair from you nose!  Ouch!  But works and lasts.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I need. Thanks</li>
    <li> This is great for removing nose hair. Love it! It&#x27;s a messy process but it everyone needs to do it.</li>
    <li> I only give it an &amp;#34;I like it&amp;#34; rating because this kit is much less painful than the old fashioned pull-one-hair-out-at-a-time technique I&#x27;m used to.( If interested, I find that the best way to avoid any pain is when the wait time is up, just yank really fast.) The problem I have is that the design of the plastic applicator stick doesn&#x27;t allow me to get to the problem hairs I bought the kit for in the first place. Maybe it just takes some placement practice, I&#x27;m not sure; but the kit does work and I really do like the concept of it. I will most likely continue to purchase this, unless another depilatory company comes out with an improved version of a similar kit.</li>
    <li> Good applicator. Not better than other brands.</li>
    <li> The product shipped quickly, price was right, but unless you&#x27;re a sadist steer clear.  This stuff hurts and hurts bad:-(</li>
    <li> This is great if you take care and not  pull out too much nose hair....some of the hairs in the back of the nose are needed!  If your careful and only get the ones closest to the outer nostril it really keeps things neat and tidy.  Yes it will hurt some...but honestly not as bad as I thought it would..Proper technique and following directions exactly for warming the wax so not to get too hot and it seems to work well.&lt;br /&gt;Yes you can reuse the applicators..but keeping some really icy water near..and once used..place in ice and the wax becomes very brittle and will break off the applicator easily.</li>
    <li> I was a little scared to try wax, especially inside of my nose. Do not be scared, it was painless and easier than I imagined.Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Does not hurt hardly at all, I use it about once a month and it keeps the hair gone and makes it easier to keep clear.</li>
    <li> FAST SHIPPER QUALITY PRODUCT</li>
    <li> I like this the only thing is you can&#x27;t just order the plastic nose waxes alone if so I would so order more have more wax then the tools to pill hair it says use sticks.  BUT the other is so way better</li>
