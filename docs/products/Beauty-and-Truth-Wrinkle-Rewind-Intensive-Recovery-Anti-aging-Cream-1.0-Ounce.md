      <li>the two of them together gives your face a nice radiant glow.</li>
      <li>I liked that reveal.  </li>
      <li>The customer service wasn&#x27;t all that nice and when I told him to just cancel everything, he practically hung up on me.  </li>
      <li>so i have very fine lines around my lips.  </li>
      <li>It is very easy to apply and it appears to be smoothing out the areas in my face,where I need it most.</li>
      <li>&amp; yes I did read all of the fine print!</li>
      <li>They better not charge my credit card.</li>
      <li>so make sure you get both.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure there is a team of people out there making sure this happens.</li>
      <li>In search of more info I stumbled across this ad for wrinkle rewind.</li>
      <li>no change whats so ever, better to stay with the ones you can count on.</li>
      <li>like i said - get both and make sure you contact them to get the discounted price of $20 each.  </li>
      <li>They suck you in with a cheap trial and then enroll u in a monthly club!</li>
      <li>AND I LOVE IT</li>
      <li>I love the Beauty &amp; Truth</li>
      <li>Not any better than the ones i buy at the corner drug store.</li>
      <li>They never charged my card more then the shipping cost</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t  order more</li>
      <li>This company is scamming innocent people.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a Jar of lotion you would be better to go, and buy yourself a 1.00 tube of whatever brand you like on the travel isle at Walmart, Target, CVS, Walgreens or</li>
      <li>I used to wear makeup because I felt it made me look &amp; feel better</li>
      <li>I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR MANY MONTHS</li>
      <li>Okay, here we go.  </li>
      <li>I then went on an internet search of dermaktive &amp; the Better Business Bureau rated them an F.</li>
      <li>in there ladies and make sure you cancel as they will do</li>
      <li>more than that A GLOW.  </li>
      <li>Many compliments for this 55 year old!!!!!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m as suspicious as the rest of you and just as easily manipulated to buy into TV ads.  </li>
      <li>so if you stay strong and demand your rights to be met.</li>
      <li>They hide the important information</li>
      <li>Dont the stories/ads for both products sound simular?</li>
      <li>The free trial of this product will cost you approx.</li>
      <li>In my opinion this is not a risk free trial.  </li>
      <li>This product leaves my face feeling gummy and makeup doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly.</li>
      <li>When you call to resolve,  they deny by stating that by accepting the &#x27;free gift&#x27; you accepted their auto bill.</li>
      <li>I ordered this product as a free trial, which has turned into a &amp;#34;trial membership&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>I called within the free trial to cancel , which it said to do on the website.</li>
      <li>I took advantage of the free trial and It worked just as they had said for me.</li>
      <li>and I got to try the product for free.</li>
      <li>I made the mistake of enrolling in their free trial.</li>
      <li>What a scam the product dose not work, when you try to return the FREE trial offer  </li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t recall becoming a willing member!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t understand the review&#x27;s with &#x27;lesser&#x27; stars - this product is amazing!  </li>
      <li>Sure wish I read this first.  </li>
      <li>I read nothing in my original purchase that said they would end up charging me $79.</li>
      <li>The \\&quot;cancel anytime at this number and a friendly representative will be available\\&quot; is hogwash.</li>
      <li>My skin feels hydrated and supple and significant difference from before I started using this product.</li>
      <li>Nothing special.</li>
      <li>thing is for certain, I am going to complain to the BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU.</li>
      <li>He would give me a refund of $50 and $48.54 even though I repeatedly told him that I wanted a full refund which he wouldn&#x27;t hear of.  </li>
      <li>They wanted to extend my trial period for another 15 days, then I could pay the full price.</li>
      <li>Got my money refunded didn&#x27;t  have to the product back finished it loved it.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s true, the Dr. Oz</li>
      <li>SO I AM READY TO ORDER MORE.  </li>
      <li>and I took her FULL name</li>
      <li>At the end of your 15-day trial period your Visa will be charged the full value of your trial order.</li>
      <li>if you have your initial jar handy, give it a whirl for month and see if your periorbital fine lines diminish.</li>
      <li>I thought for the 3.95 trial price, I would love to try a new product, especially if it was as good as all the reviews.  </li>
      <li>Luckily, my bank suspected fraudulent activities &amp; put a hold on my card.</li>
      <li>Luckily, going through Amazon meant I had no ordering hassles.  </li>
      <li>First of all I thought that the product was free if I paid the shipping price of $3.95 each for the Wrinkle Rewind and the OxyGenius.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am a fifty eight year old who cant believe how many compliments I have had on my complexion since I began using this product.</li>
      <li>Well worth the $$$$$....</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s a bargain for young, healthy looking skin.  </li>
      <li>Also, after your free trial be sure the cancel the future shipments</li>
      <li>A raw food vegan diet including a great deal of fresh wheatgrass juice, research Ann Wigmore and Victoria Boutenko</li>
      <li>I received the sample right away, with a member ship card, which I did not sign up for.  </li>
      <li>Something just isn&#x27;t right.</li>
      <li>I an positive this is not for me SCAM!</li>
      <li>I see many comments of concern regarding their apparently aggressive advertising.  </li>
      <li>It certainly helps the bags beneath the eyes!</li>
      <li>But use is for a month, without prejudice, and likely you will notice a significant plumpness to the skin as the collagen is rebuilt and the fine wrinkles begin to recede.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Funny</li>
      <li>so they can no longer charge me for this extremely stinky product that I am sure does not work!</li>
      <li>They will not allow me to return the first samples I received (that are still unopened).  </li>
      <li>the $4.95 I was willing to wager.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product is an absolute scam. I bought it because the advertisement stated that it was recommended by Dr. Oz. The very next day, Dr. Oz made a public announcement stating no one should purchase any product claiming to be endorsed by him. He stated that he would never endorse a particular product and anyone using his picture or name for advertisement purposes is doing so without his consent. I saw other reviews where people did not get their money back; therefore, I simply canceled my debit card and got a new one so they can no longer charge me for this extremely stinky product that I am sure does not work! I had just applied the product to my face when Dr. Oz made the announcement..talk about timing! I immediately washed the stinky crap off my face. Do not purchase this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could give it 0 stars.</li>
    <li> Please do NOT buy this product.  It doesn&#x27;t do 1 single thing that it promises to do. They have you get the trial offer and if you don&#x27;t read the back of the business card they charge almost 90 dollars to your credit card.  DO NOT MAKE THIS MISTAKE! ! It&#x27;s not a good product.</li>
    <li> I have not even opened the product when I discovered that my Visa had already been charged $78.49.  I called the automatic voice and cancelled it but cannot get this charge off of my credit card without contacting customer service and there is no number other than the automatic.  So I will just have my bank return the amount and lodge a protest.</li>
    <li> HI, This is a little unorthodox, I have not purchased this item, but the advertisement caught my eye and I searched for it on Amazon out of curiosity. I avoid these kinds of mixes and instead, I use separate oils for my face, and they are extremely helpful; raw organic coconut oil, vitamin e oil, almond oil, vitamin c serum, and hyaluronic acid, sometimes DMAE H3.  But other effective ways to assist skin health are:&lt;br /&gt;1. A raw food vegan diet including a great deal of fresh wheatgrass juice, research Ann Wigmore and Victoria Boutenko&lt;br /&gt;2. facial yoga--look up Ranjana Kahn on youtube, she offers a nine minute tutorial&lt;br /&gt;3. exercise, which increases collagen production&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps those who are dissatisfied with mainstream products!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about three years now and love it!  I see many comments of concern regarding their apparently aggressive advertising.  They are a business!!  And you can cancel anytime.  I depend on this product!</li>
    <li> The fact that that Ellen D is a spokes model for this makes me not want to buy it.  Who the F wants to look like that effing haggy dyke</li>
    <li> after reading the reviews about how hard it is to cancle after 15 day trial time is up .  I an positive this is not for me SCAM!</li>
    <li> Great product, but  the price is getting up to fast.</li>
    <li> Horrible company!  Talk about deceptive business practices.  The amount of hoops you must jump through to return this product is ridiculous.  Let&#x27;s put it this way...your trial membership comes with lots of strings attached.  Don&#x27;t believe what you read by people saying there is nothing wrong with the company.  I have had to call numerous times and after waiting on hold for 20 minutes then start to express my frustration, they simply hang up on me.</li>
    <li> I DID use the product and it doesn&#x27;t do anything.  I can&#x27;t believe I fell for the phony claim but I did.  They hide the important information and then they charge your card BEFORE the trial is up.  I called an cancelled and then they charged my card.  I am going after them.</li>
    <li> It does work sorry I bought it.</li>
    <li> Thank goodness for Amazon&#x27;s customer reviews.  I almost fell for this ad as well!!</li>
    <li> So far so good. Will order another one later....</li>
    <li> Love this product......discontinued the auto refill due to $$$, but once I went back to my previous product.......absolutely NO comparison....Well worth the $$$$$.... Many compliments for this 55 year old!!!!!! My skin feels hydrated and supple and significant difference from before I started using this product.</li>
    <li> I have the same complaint as others - placed an order for a sample for a cost of &amp;#34;postage only&amp;#34; and received a package with a membership card stating I would receive and be billed for a product each month - something I never agreed to.  I accessed the Better Business Bureau in Troy, Michigan where they are located and placed a formal complaint, something everyone else should do as well.  I also called my credit card company and cancelled my existing card - they will reissue a new card and hopefully this one will not be charged.  If it is, I indicated that I would dispute the charge and not pay it since I never agreed to a membership or to receive any additional products.  Judging from the reviews here I am quite hesitant about even using the product - I am holding on to the items and not opening them just in case they ask for return, but plan to have my dermatologist look at the ingredient listing to see if it is in any way harmful.  This has certainly proven to be a lesson to me and I will NEVER again order a sample product for &amp;#34;postage only&amp;#34;!!!</li>
    <li> Please, please everyone do not order the Wrinkle rewind or the Oxygenius.  This is the biggest marketing scam I have run across in a long time. I ordered this product because of a &amp;#34;risk free&amp;#34; promotional. When I read some customer feedback I saw some had been charged 78 dollars for each product the month following.  The small print says that by ordering the &amp;#34;trial&amp;#34; you are agreeing to enroll in AUTOMATIC shipping. The free trial of this product will cost you approx. $170 DOLLARS. When I called the Monday following my Friday order I was informed that my order could be canceled but S/H would still be charged to my card. My point is if you accept the trial you are locked in to the. In my opinion this is not a risk free trial.  Please beware.</li>
    <li> This product worked well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would all the people who HATED this product please contact me at desherwood@ptd.net ??? I will happily buy the introductory sample from you--it worked for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s work out a price and talk! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it, but in the ad, the before and after photos are clearly the same picture photoshopped.  So, really, the miracle is Photoshop - everyone should buy it to look younger, at least in photographs!</li>
    <li> This product caused my skin to break out in large bumpy pimple type lumps with white heads almost overnight.  Customer service will not acknowledge my concerns about the contents of this product, will not return phone calls, seems to only have one concern, money.  Not worth the free trial, you will be charged for new shipments every month.</li>
    <li> This product works great with Oxy Genius, the two of them together gives your face a nice radiant glow. I will admit that the fragrance was a little strong in the beginning. It&#x27;s floral smell which I am not fond of. However, I have adjusted to it, but is out of the Oxy Genius. The Oxy Genius bottle should be redesigned, as you&#x27;re not able to get the last drop of this miracle product...</li>
    <li> Will not reorder this product</li>
    <li> THIS IS A TOTAL SCAM. I ordered it and with 1/2 hr decided to cancel. The \\&quot;cancel anytime at this number and a friendly representative will be available\\&quot; is hogwash. I tried 4 times. Each time they went thru a tape recorded schpeel about how about this alternative, and this, and this and FINALLY it rings thru to a customer service rep. As soon as it starts to ring, the call aborts. In other words the only way to cancel is to get the product and mail it back with you paying for the postage. They better not charge my credit card. I had one opportunity to leave a message. I very firmly said to cancel my order. Made no difference. Yesterday they said it was in the mail. First time I&#x27;ve ever done anything like this online and it will be my last!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work, Dr Oz must get kickbacks!! Shameful advertising.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in this product. After using it as directed for 1 week, I saw no difference. According to the video, you should see a noticeable decrease almost immediately - lies! Don&#x27;t waste your time and money!</li>
    <li> What a scam the product dose not work, when you try to return the FREE trial offer  they charge your account anyway. You cant get help from the 24 hour phone line its a recorded message</li>
    <li> Sorry, but I have to disagree with the women who say this doesn&#x27;t work!  I just ordered my 5th jar of this, 2 from the commercial on tv, 2 from ebay and 1 from Amazon.  I had deep wrinkles on each side of my nose and since I&#x27;ve been using this they have almost disappeared, I can just barely feel them now.  I used to wear makeup because I felt it made me look &amp; feel better, now I put this on my face and go to town without makeup.  I like the way my face looks.  Women  have commented to me many times that I look younger than my actual age of 58.</li>
    <li> This product leaves my face feeling gummy and makeup doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly. Plus, the whole process is a scam. You are told you are getting a trial but then less than two weeks after receiving the product, you are put on auto shipping and charged almost $80 per product. The trial products that are supposed to be yours for the shipping fee must be returned. Getting  a refund was a a nightmare. Do not fall for the ad that sucks you in.</li>
    <li> My daughters , said they can see a change.  They would like to try it but it is to expensive.</li>
    <li> This is a very ugly scheme to get money by forcing charges for a &amp;#34;trial&amp;#34; , and only canceling future orders by spending more money for a return.  No matter what the product results, this is unacceptable business practice.</li>
    <li> As a moisturizing agent, the product was acceptable. As a wrinkle reducer, I found it did not do the job. Possibly I expected a faster improvement.</li>
    <li> As previous customers complained, my complaints are in total agreement.  Sucker you in!!!  I&#x27;m not finished with them yet.  I feel really cheated because a person from my community vouched for this product or I would never have been tempted to try this product.  UGH</li>
    <li> I cannot believe they have not been caught up with! I am sooo angry at myself for falling for such bull_ _ _ _!&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY!!!</li>
    <li> To all you unfortunate ladies out there who we&#x27;re dumped like me, keep persisting with the cancellation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the sample cream and payed for the packaging only.&lt;br /&gt;At no point was I informed about any subscription, monthly payments or cancellation obligations nor did I receive a confirmation with any terms and conditions explaining this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product never arrived and I now I got charged €78,49, so after contacting my bank about the fraudulent charge, I googled till I was blue a contact number in France and eventually I came through to the us customer service lady who &amp;#34;speaks&amp;#34; French.&lt;br /&gt;We continued the conversation in English and I explained the situation and demanded for the fake subscription to be cancelled.&lt;br /&gt;For 10 long minutes she kept trying to send me the product and offer me a reduced price for the monthly payments but as I kept stating that the companies actions were illegal and that I had and will again report them to the authorities she finally cancelled my subscription. I waited on the phone for the conformation email and I took her FULL name too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hang in there ladies and make sure you cancel as they will do so if you stay strong and demand your rights to be met.</li>
    <li> Before you buy this, go to their website and look closely at the pictures.  In the before and after pictures the women&#x27;s eye lashes are exactly the same.  Look at the hair curled by their necks...exactly the same.  The \\&quot;after\\&quot; pictures are air brushed \\&quot;before\\&quot; pictures.  If they are going to scam people, they should at least be smart enough to take a completely different picture for the \\&quot;after\\&quot; shot and then air brush that one.  They aren&#x27;t even good at scamming people</li>
    <li> SO....I wanted to cancel, becasue I didn&#x27;t want to continue at the high price.  They wanted to give me a discount, then they wanted to extend my trial time, then gave me advice on how to apply.  Each time they came back I said NO, I want o canel.  It was a very difficult process but they finally id give me a cancellation  number.  Next, I will see if they really do cancel it.  Very hard sell even as you cancel.</li>
    <li> Used this for one month and it did nothing for me no change whats so ever, better to stay with the ones you can count on.</li>
    <li> Please people, join me in disputing charges on your credit card.  If enough people dispute charge...maybe we can not end up falling victim to the poor choice of buying into this scam.  I cancelled within 15 days and still got charged the $150. for two tiny bottles of product.  My fingers are crossed that they don&#x27;t win this dispute.  I read nothing in my original purchase that said they would end up charging me $79. bucks a pop for these samples......why would I have willingly chosen to do something so stupid.  the $4.95 I was willing to wager.  Never again.&lt;br /&gt;And it&#x27;s true, the Dr. Oz (and Oprah wasn&#x27;t it) recommendation/commercial on Facebook I believe.  Never AGAIN!!!</li>
    <li> Expensive if not purchased on Amazon. It works well. I keep buying it. Rich cream that sinks into skin! Good</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR MANY MONTHS AND I LOVE IT, I RECOMMEND IT.  IT HAS IMPROVED MY FACIAL&lt;br /&gt;SKIN 100%.  SO I AM READY TO ORDER MORE.  THANK YOU1</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS SUPPOSE TO HELP WITH WRINKLES AND IT DOES NOT&lt;br /&gt;I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE. I THOUGHT AT FIRST THAT&lt;br /&gt;IT MIGHT HELP BUT I GO BACK TO OTHER PRODUCTS. THIS WAS OVER&lt;br /&gt;$50.00 BUT THIS IS NOT AMAZONS FAULT.</li>
    <li> I have to say that the advertising for this was something that pulled me in. So I Googled the product and noticed there are no negative reviews which makes me very suspicious. Plus there are pages of links that lead you back to the product which can only mean the company is trolling the web to make sure that anything Googled gets a positive bunch of links, however one does that. I&#x27;m sure there is a team of people out there making sure this happens. I just want to warn everybody to hold back on spending on this product until you find a decent review you can trust. You know there are some negative reviews out there. Why can&#x27;t I find them? Something just isn&#x27;t right.</li>
    <li> I love the Beauty &amp; Truth&lt;br /&gt;Wrinkle Rewind and all the products.</li>
    <li> Accidentally posted - should have been for Nuvie.</li>
    <li> The trial offer did not mention you have 15 days to send back or you&#x27;re charged $85!!  Also, the e-mail confirm only says you&#x27;ll be charged the full amount but never says what that $ amount is.  I called the customer service number.  The recorded operator takes you through a bunch of recordings and prompts and I stayed on the line for over 5 minutes until it hung up on me.  Luckily I used a prepaid CC so they can only charge me the balance on the card.  I will keep trying to cancel but if I can&#x27;t get through, at least I have that security.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be taken</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any improvement in soft lines and wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I would dearly love another jar, if possible!</li>
    <li> This did not do what it advertised and was a complete joke.</li>
    <li> I made the mistake of enrolling in their free trial. As others reviews have indicated, they engage in deceptive business practices that will surface on your credit card statement. I have accumulated over two hours of wait time trying to get their customer service reps on the phone. For all I know their customer service reps do not actually exist.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product as a free trial, which has turned into a &amp;#34;trial membership&amp;#34;.  I was charge the $3.95 as per the offer, being able to cancel further product being sent to me within 15 days.  I did cancel, but had an automated message - could not get a person - that told me I could return the unused portion for a charge of $40.  I sent 3 emails, called 3 times - each time being told that there was a heavy volume of calls due to a &amp;#34;typhoon&amp;#34; somewhere.  I finally got a response via email telling me I could keep the unused portion for $19.95.  This is a scam - pure and simple.</li>
    <li> Total SCAM operation. They offer a &#x27;free gift&#x27; for completion of a short survey and then begin sending you a useless bottle of baby lotion and charge your credit card 89.15 montly with no tie to the company. When you call to resolve,  they deny by stating that by accepting the &#x27;free gift&#x27; you accepted their auto bill. This is a fruadulent and horrible place of business.&lt;br /&gt;Do not fall for their ads. Product is not worth the postage it is shipped with.&lt;br /&gt;Better Business Bureau needs to get involved with Nu Vie Skin Care and shut down these SCAMS.</li>
    <li> This is a scam!!&lt;br /&gt;This does not work!&lt;br /&gt;The website has to write this:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;The story depicted on this site and the person depicted in the story are not real unless stated otherwise.

Already ordered it and we are both going to try this out, thanks. - The  Higgins family&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This person is also on the https://www.hiphopindo.net/news/audio/index.php and it is a totally different person but exact same message and name instead of looking old now they need to lose weight lol!! Same Sponsor for the  Garcinia Cambogia Extract. BTW that is a bunch of BULL as well..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a Jar of lotion you would be better to go, and buy yourself a 1.00 tube of whatever brand you like on the travel isle at Walmart, Target, CVS, Walgreens or whatever store you go to!</li>
    <li> So far I see no differance in face wrinkle&#x27;s and face feels dry after application.. My skin feels parched and somewhat pulled , not soft and supple. I am dissapointed.</li>
    <li> Did not like the product</li>
    <li> I like it.  It is very easy to apply and it appears to be smoothing out the areas in my face,where I need it most. The lines seem  to be disappearing.</li>
    <li> Not any better than the ones i buy at the corner drug store.</li>
    <li> Browsing threw Facebook the other day I came across an advertisement for a skin care product called dermaktive.Dr.Memmit Oz(as in DR.OZ from the Oprah Winfrey show) was in the advertisement &amp; the product was claiming to be discovered by him or a guest who was appearing on his show. Any how it was for this reason I clicked on the link &amp; read the ad. A woman was claiming she had discovered a beauty secret that works better then botox that after purchasing two different facial products that didn&#x27;t work so great separately she discoved putting them together they worked miracles! The product is called Dermaktive and guess what? You can receive a FREE 30 day trial &amp; only have to pay 5.45$ for shipping! Sounds great rite? I thought so to! Unfortunately you know what they say about \\&quot;if it sounds to good\\&quot;! Well it was! After putting in my personal info it asked for payment info. Credit cards are usually the only form of payment so it didn&#x27;t seem unusual &amp; yes I did read all of the fine print! Needles to say I received my credit card statement and there it was! My annual membership fee&#x27;s! Funny I don&#x27;t recall becoming a willing member! I then went on an internet search of dermaktive &amp; the Better Business Bureau rated them an F. In search of more info I stumbled across this ad for wrinkle rewind. Dont the stories/ads for both products sound simular? And after reading all the complaints about people getting charged for a membership with wrinkle rewind im convinced that wrinkle rewind and dermaktive are the same company and are using multiple sites to deceive the public! This is only my observation &amp; opinion if you want to decide for yourself go to.www.dermaktive..com and check it out!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand the review&#x27;s with &#x27;lesser&#x27; stars - this product is amazing!  I am a smoker and drink LOTS of water so i have very fine lines around my lips.  Ever since i started using Wrinkle Rewind the wrinkles are fading!  It truly DOES WORK!!  I have always used it WITH the oxi-genius tho so make sure you get both.  Also, after your free trial be sure the cancel the future shipments then you can TALK THEM DOWN to only $20 per month each!!!!!!!  Sorry Amazon!  But we can get these cheaper though the actual company!  Please!  If you had a bad experience with these do like i said - get both and make sure you contact them to get the discounted price of $20 each.  Go to findbeautyandtruth.com</li>
    <li> Product did not work as advertised</li>
    <li> I USE WRINKLE REWIND TWICE DAILY,MORNING AND NIGHT.I CAN TELL A DIFFERENCE UNDER MY EYES,I WILL SAY FOR ME, ITS THE BEST I HAVE EVER USED. THANKS WRINKLE REWIND.</li>
    <li> I wish I had read the reviews on this product before I ordered!  This company is scamming innocent people.  Unfortunately, I fell for it and tried to get my money back!  They said they would send part of it back, but not all!!! Their ad is misleading it makes you think you are only paying $3.95 and $4.95 for trial size jars, then they charge you $78.49 and $79.95 for the product they send you!  They told me they would send part of the amount they took out of my account.  I am waiting to see if they do or not.  I wish I knew how to get all my money back!  Any suggestions are welcome!  I shouldn&#x27;t have marked any stars!!!  I leave it to Arch Angel Michael to handle it for me.</li>
    <li> Just a good night cream. Nothing special.</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t list the ingredients!!!</li>
    <li> Best anti-wrinkle product I&#x27;ve found</li>
    <li> always delivers as promised</li>
    <li> Product is good, but I received it with no receipt. No papers in package. I don&#x27;t like that. I order a lot through amazon and this is the first time I haven&#x27;t gotton any type of paper work/billing information.</li>
    <li> Dr. Oz promoted this product.  It seems every product you see on his show, does not work as advertised.  Save your money.</li>
    <li> Did not see the results the were advertised.</li>
    <li> DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT! IT IS A SCAM AND WHEN YOU CANCELL, THEY WILL CONTINUE TO CHARGE YOUR ACCOUNT $88.97 AND BE RUDE WHEN YOU CALL TO DISPUTE THE CHARGES AND HANG UP ON YOU!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for one week.  Like how my skin looks and feels.  Come on, people, it took 57 years for my skin to develop this condition, it&#x27;s not going to clear up in a week.  I&#x27;m going to give it a chance.  If $29.95 a month is the price they offer you for wanting to cancel, take it and run!  That&#x27;s a bargain for young, healthy looking skin.  Am wondering if perhaps you aren&#x27;t taking the supplements?  From what I read (not on their website), those are a crucial part of the program.  I work hard for my money and am willing to spend some of it on me for me!</li>
    <li> I thought for the 3.95 trial price, I would love to try a new product, especially if it was as good as all the reviews.  So I ordered the 15 day trial size.  I then get an email confirming my trial order and that I&#x27;ve been automatically enrolled in their monthly refill program.  That I have 30 days to call and cancel.  I called immediately and cancelled the order.  No where did it state this when ordering.  I could have tried the product for 15 days THEN called cancelled the automatic enrollment, BUT I felt like I was scammed with this automatic enrollment and didn&#x27;t want to chance anything.  The customer service wasn&#x27;t all that nice and when I told him to just cancel everything, he practically hung up on me.  Beware.  Here is the info they send AFTER you order (again, no where is stated this WHEN you order):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;If you made a trial order purchase, you&#x27;ve been automatically enrolled in our time-saving Delivery Program. At the end of your 15-day trial period your Visa will be charged the full value of your trial order. Every 30 days thereafter, you&#x27;ll be sent a full-size refill order using your Visa on file. We offer a 30-day guarantee. Should you decide for any reason that you do not wish to keep the product, you may return it for a full refund, less the cost of shipping &amp; handling. Return shipping is the responsibility of the customer.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I tried this product because of a large deep wrinkle under the left eye. Nothing was working. After my credit card company helped end&lt;br /&gt;the double charge and got me out of the contract, I decided to try it. After ten days the deep wrinkle was almost gone. It does work. If I decide to reorder, I will probably do so on here. Safer!</li>
    <li> Loved how it made my skin feel...there is something astringent in it that tightens everything up, and we can all do with that!  Problem is, WHAT exactly IS in it?  How about a complete list of ingredients?  I went on line and read reviews from the Beauty &amp; Truth website - if I had visited this website earlier, I would NEVER have ordered the product.  Luckily, going through Amazon meant I had no ordering hassles.  I will probably not order it again.  Feels like a scam.</li>
    <li> I ordered  the product from the TV ad. Loved the product it actually  worked for me the crap with the company charging my account  before the trial  period  was up was my only problem. Got my money refunded didn&#x27;t  have to the product back finished it loved it. Didn&#x27;t  order more but now I&#x27;m  just not from that company.</li>
    <li> After being pulled-in by the product ad, I tried it.  A couple days later,my face, neck &amp; chest where I made the application turned red, swelled-up, bumps,ichy, soar, &amp; very unattractive.  Clearly I was having a bad reaction to one or more of the ingredients.  I&#x27;ve tried various creams in the past &amp; have never had any problems.  Oddly enough, it seems to get progressively worse even though I immediately stopped using the product after the 1st symptoms arrived.  This is day 3 &amp; if it doesn&#x27;t start showing signs of fading, I&#x27;m going to end up with a dermatologist visit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, For me - it was a bad -bad experience.</li>
    <li> this product is awesome it renewed my skin so all you people who gave bad reviews need to take better care of yourself because i am a drinker and a heavy smoker and this product makes me look 20 yrs younger!</li>
    <li> I bought the sample from a small ad on facebook, it said you get a 15 day supply for 3.95 shipping and handling.  I received the sample right away, with a member ship card, which I did not sign up for.  It stated that I would receive 1 bottle per month, regular price, and that I would be billed full price after I used the sample bottle for 15 days.  In other words they let me use the product for 15 days for 3.95, then charge full price for the same bottle. I called twice to cancel the membership I never ordered, the email address takes you no where.  Both calls, I spoke to people I could hardly understand, and apparently they couldn&#x27;t understand me.  They wanted to extend my trial period for another 15 days, then I could pay the full price. I told both people I don&#x27;t want a membership, and don&#x27;t want anymore product.  The last person agreed to charge me 19.95 for the trial, they collected from my bank the same day.  The last person also said my membership would be canceled.  I hope I don&#x27;t have to get a lawyer to get out of a contract I never signed up for.  Be very careful buying this product, Donna O</li>
    <li> I called the company 1 866 number, waited and finally got a customer service lady.  I looked for the ingredients in the Wrinkle Rewind product.  Online the key ingredients looked natural enough.  I liked that reveal.  I looked for  the rest of the ingredients and since nothing else was on the website,  I called for the other ingredients not listed.  She took my email and said to check out the info she is sending.  I never got any email from her or any ingredient list.  Wonder what happened.  I don&#x27;t want to try any cream that has something I am allergic to.  Does this cream contain glycols?  Glycols are antifreeze.  Isn&#x27;t antifreeze a poison?  I have bought creams that contain glycols and what a waste of time to have to return a useless product because I did not check out the ingredient list ahead of time.  I am doing it this time.  No order unless I see there are no ingredients that would cause me a reaction or compromise the natural ingredients. Glycols do not belong in any skin product. No aluminum either.  The review is about caution.  I want a good product that works for me. The before and after photos look good.  But, I want the answers.  Is Wrinkle Rewind a product for me? Depends on what is in it. I am not jumping on the bandwsgon because of the photos.  I am looking deeper.  Be advised.  Waited for a call back.  Some time has passed and never got a call back.  Waiting. Today is Nov.8, 2012.</li>
    <li> My experience is about the same as other consumers.  There is much that I did not understand when I responded to the advertise.  First of all I thought that the product was free if I paid the shipping price of $3.95 each for the Wrinkle Rewind and the OxyGenius.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twenty days after I had ordered these products, I called to cancel the orders.  Then a couple days later, I noticed that my checking account had been charged $78.49 and &amp;79.95 for the two samples, two and five days before this.  What I did not know was that I had two weeks to try these two products and if I did not cancel in that period of time, I would be charged for the trial products of approximately $80 each.  The trial products were not free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I called, the customer support person (for these two products) would not give me my money back.  He said that he could allow me to pay just $29.95 for each one because I was within the 30 day window.  He would give me a refund of $50 and $48.54 even though I repeatedly told him that I wanted a full refund which he wouldn&#x27;t hear of.  Out of shear frustration, I agreed to the $50 and $48 refunds.  Before this, I told him that I had not opened the product yet so I could send it back to get a full refund.  He would not consider it.  He kept repeating to me the $29.95 per month per product deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I told him that I wanted out of the program.  Another thing that was not an option.  This really made me very angry.  He said that he would give me until February 15th to call and cancel the products or there would be a withdrawal of $29.95 per product.  I repeatedly told him that I wanted to be totally cancelled. He just kept telling me I had until Feb. 15th to try the product and if I did not like the product I should cancel befor February 15th.  Finally I agreed with him and I will call them back and will try cancelling it in a few days.  It really made me angry that he would not let me out of the program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing is for certain, I am going to complain to the BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU.</li>
    <li> Why are there only two reviews and neither of them even used the product??!! Before I  buy it I would like to hear from people who actually use it.</li>
    <li> I just received it  so i don&#x27;t want to say one star or five so i had to put something so i put three stars.

    <li> This cream is a scam! Worst I&#x27;ve ever used- actually made skin so dry - I looked older and slight wrinkles or creases were intensified. They just charged my card for a refill I recd today!  Returning in am! WORST!</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product!  The small print is very deceptive, the product is very expensive and now I am seeing so many negative reviews about it not working.  And the customer service department is awful!  They will not allow me to return the first samples I received (that are still unopened).  They are terrible, it&#x27;s a scam. If this was a legitimate company with good products they would allow customers who were not happy with the product (or the price) to return it.  Don&#x27;t do it!</li>
    <li> LOVE this cream! Not sure I am showing less wrinkles, but my skin is softer and more moist.</li>
    <li> They suck you in with a cheap trial and then enroll u in a monthly club! $160 in charges the 1st  month!</li>
    <li> I am a fifty eight year old who cant believe how many compliments I have had on my complexion since I began using this product. Is it coincidence? Maybe. But I&#x27;m buying it again. I&#x27;ll let you know in a couple of months. Signed nurse in NJ</li>
    <li> I agree with the other reviews.  THIS IS A TOTAL SCAM.  My jar reeked of mildew. When I contacted them about the terrible smell they wanted me to return it at my expense and would replace it at the full price.  Sure wish I read this first.  Live and learn.</li>
    <li> i do not know whether product is helping however, the fragrance is nice.</li>
    <li> I took advantage of the free trial and It worked just as they had said for me. I called within the free trial to cancel , which it said to do on the website. They never charged my card more then the shipping cost and I got to try the product for free. And the product worked great</li>
    <li> Yes, the introduction to this product was sleazy and made promises not kept as far as the marketing program went (most all of us who tried this were caught in the same &#x60;auto-renewal scheme which is a bother and bad business). But get past the problems this company had with its initial presentation and simply use the moisturizer as directed and test it for yourself. The ingredients are indeed listed on the box in which the cream is delivered and do not suggest any miracle drug. But use is for a month, without prejudice, and likely you will notice a significant plumpness to the skin as the collagen is rebuilt and the fine wrinkles begin to recede.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For this reviewer the cream works as described, so if you have your initial jar handy, give it a whirl for month and see if your periorbital fine lines diminish. It certainly helps the bags beneath the eyes! Grady Harp, July 14</li>
    <li> I fell for the ads &amp; started to order this. I stopped before submitting the form, &amp; thought that was the end. The next day, one of their reps. called me to see if she could help me complete the purchase. All her questions made me suspicious, so I told her to stop because I was no longer interested in ordering. During the following 4 days, Beauty &amp; Truth tried to bill my credit card 4 times. Luckily, my bank suspected fraudulent activities &amp; put a hold on my card. When I called customer service, the rep. told me that I was not on the system, so they weren&#x27;t trying to bill me. They stuck to this story even after I told them that they had called me the prior week &amp; I reached them using a phone number the bank gave me. I finally had to cancel the credit card &amp; get another one issued with a different number. Stay away from these people!</li>
    <li> Love the cream but not much of it for the price.  Used as directed with NO results.</li>
    <li> Okay, here we go.  I&#x27;m as suspicious as the rest of you and just as easily manipulated to buy into TV ads.  The product arrived and of course I forgot to cancel within the time limit and wracked up unnecessary charges.  Finally cancelled.  In the meantime I had two jars and used them conscientiously (sp?).  Before the first jar was gone I noticed a new smoothness to my skin, but more than that A GLOW.  The effects show up in my photos.  Just so you know, I&#x27;m 73 and the choice of a wrinkle cream ain&#x27;t no joke.  Although the company advertises Wrinkle Rewind for $88, it can be obtained for $39.95 if one signs up for monthly purchases.</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful. I use it conjunction with the Revivagenix serum. Noticeable difference. It also smells really good. Recommend it highly !</li>
    <li> 2 wks in and not seeing a difference yet....</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference or imporvement</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
    <li> It did not meet my expectations</li>
</ol>
