<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Hard to review these products. How do you know you&#x27;re not sick because of this OR if you get sick is it less intense because of this, or would you have gotten sick MORE without it.  It&#x27;s quite subject and really unmeasurable.  I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle.  I feel sick today but I don&#x27;t know if it will become a cold, the flu, or what?  Or anything.  Like I said. Very difficult to make assumptions because that&#x27;s all they&#x27;d really be.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is about this vitamin but it seems to do the job.  I was told about this at my local compound pharmacy when picking up other items.  I am not sure exactly what the ingredients are but whenever I stop taking them, I seem to get sick and when I do take them, I don&#x27;t get sick very often.  They are very expensive so only worth taking if you think they work for you.  I find them cheaper on Amazon then they are at the store.  The 500mg is as high as $60 in the store which makes them $2 a pill and that is a lot!</li>
    <li> Better and cheaper choice</li>
    <li> This is a premier product. I have used it for many years personally, with my family and with my family practice patients. I don&#x27;t go a day without it.</li>
    <li> This product when taken daily keeps me healthy. That is why I highly recommend this product to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daniel C. Stewart</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who is not feeling their best.  I felt the difference right away! I was not as tired after taking it and have not gotten sick easily like I used to from colds and viruses.  I had a friend that recommended this product to me because it helped her and her children because they were suffering from the symptoms of lyme disease and once they started taking it they have felt better ever since! It is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> My husband and I have taken this for a long time. We dont seem to get sick. Will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> Felt immediately better and proceeded to get better fast - from a flu type thing. Picks me up if I have an energy slump. Keeps me strong through others&#x27; illnesses, and helps them too.</li>
    <li> Since starting these Beta Glucan WGP, over a year ago, I catch about one cold per school year. I didn&#x27;t believe the hype but was desperate to up my immunity, this does it for sure.</li>
    <li> It is very simple concept you take your pill and you boost your immune system, you should take it consistently. You boost it does not make you invincible and you should take care or yourself. So far no cold or flu.</li>
    <li> I personally have not noticed a difference with one bottle of it, but maybe I need to try it for longer.  Many other people seemed to get such great results.  Worth a try!</li>
    <li> We started taking this a few years ago to prevent illness.  It has really worked well for us.  The combination of mushrooms help to bolster the immune system.  We turn to it to give us the edge that usually means getting sick or NOT.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know if this product is working.  The caps are easy to swallow.  Researched this product before purchasing.  Read study published in Nature where it was discussed that all beta glucans not alike and this product got high ratings.  Since supplements in general are not regulated by the FDA it is hard to determine product quality.  Hence you have to rely on company honesty and independent labs to verify quality.</li>
    <li> best thing I have taken for my cancer</li>
    <li> So, I&#x27;ve been taking Immune Health Basics for 4 months now and have been exposed numerous times to sick people and have been able to stay healthy. I started taking it as my immune system was run down and I was catching every bug that came my way. I&#x27;ll report back in a few months once flu season has passed...</li>
    <li> Original and good quality. Cheaper than buying at the supplement store if you can find one that sells this. Don&#x27;t know if it works because i take this as a precaution. Just a security blanket. I eat my veggies and take good care of myself.</li>
    <li> I have been taking Immune Health Basics since September.  While my co-workers and family have experienced colds and the flu, I have remained healthy.  This is the best scienced based immune supplement that I have found.</li>
    <li> It is good for supporting breast cancer follow-up.</li>
    <li> my doctor, educated at Harvard, is a die-hard supporter of this product for chemo and immune improvement. I was told to wait until my chemo is over to take it...but my GP thinks it is safe right now. I took it before chemo and was getting over a cold and this product worked like a charm and I felt better and lost my fever by the next day.</li>
    <li> Unbelievable change in my energy levels.  Prior to this I could hardly get out of bed, then would get tired early afternoon.  I think it already helped me fight off a cold.  Where has this been the past 30 years???  So glad I found this.  Quick delivery, good price.</li>
