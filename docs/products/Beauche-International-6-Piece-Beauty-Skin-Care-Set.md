      <li>I first got the product from my aunt, she said it works wonderfully for her</li>
      <li>My aunt used this product and gave her amazing result.</li>
      <li>Not so effective to me.</li>
      <li>Gotta be honest</li>
      <li>I just love it.</li>
      <li>and I probably take a million selfies a day after that:)</li>
      <li>Love this products and their customer service</li>
      <li>This product broke me out, I gave it a month hoping it&#x27;ll get better.</li>
      <li>and I love the product</li>
      <li>Really love the product...</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>All in all I really love these products, been using em for a year or so, been keeping my face 90% clean without buring, redness n stuff.</li>
      <li>Hahahahaha:)</li>
      <li>It really WORKS :-)  </li>
      <li>Not a bad skin product at all.</li>
      <li>super small packaging... but its good!</li>
      <li>Shipment is fast too!  </li>
      <li>but Im sure it will soon finger cross</li>
      <li>I think every time I look in a mirror I would stop and be amazed how pretty that person is in the mirror</li>

      <li>i am not sure how many sets before my face cleared up !</li>
      <li>For the meantime, i bought the whole package, to see the full potential of Beauche.</li>
      <li>the exfoliating cream burns at first, then you apply the rejuvenating after about 15 mins, it all went back to normal.</li>
      <li>, my main problem was my scars from old acne.</li>
      <li>Theres a little stinging and itchy and breakouts at first but its tolerable its worth it no pain no gain</li>
      <li>I had acne scars that were lightly visible and uneven skin tone.</li>
      <li>I even recommend it to my sister who has the same problem and told it really made a difference..</li>
      <li>I only gave 4 stars because the bottle of the toner was leaking &amp; there was more than 1/3 of the liquid that  was wasted.</li>
      <li>This is the only one that really satisfy my needs in facial care.</li>
      <li>I was so disappointed since I didn&#x27;t received the 2 sets of beauche skin care that I ordered the last time even though I got a refund its frustrating to experienced this kind of situation since I&#x27;ve been ordering the same products for a long time.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;m a guy, I play sports and I work out every now and then. I&#x27;ve been battling with acne since I was 14 and now I&#x27;m 19. I first got the product from my aunt, she said it works wonderfully for her so I thought hey, why not right? so I did. Gotta be honest the exfoliating cream burns at first, then you apply the rejuvenating after about 15 mins, it all went back to normal. First 3 weeks I still broke out pretty much like I used to, then after that it all changed. My face has never been clearer ever, I went to my dermatologist all they gave me were products with Benzoyl Peroxide which burn my face like hell, but not with these beauche products. All in all I really love these products, been using em for a year or so, been keeping my face 90% clean without buring, redness n stuff. Try em, you wont regret it.</li>
    <li> Just what I&#x27;m looking for...</li>
    <li> I love it! Its very effective. I have been suffering from acne since the 4th grade and this product honestly gave my hope! It will make your skin exfoliate like CRAZY the first few weeks but after that you&#x27;ll realize its all worth it! My skin feels softer and smoother! I break out less too and my marks are clearing out. I just love it. &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I think it works and this is my 3rd set my scar its not clear yet  but Im sure it will soon finger cross i am not sure how many sets before my face cleared up !</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife. She loved it and arrived in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> Not so effective to me.</li>
    <li> super small packaging... but its good!</li>
    <li> I am Male, 43 of age, just wanted to get rid of dried skin and blemishes. I am just using my wife&#x27;s Rejuvenating Cream for testing. For only 3 days of  using, i can see the difference on the smoothness of my face. Not a bad skin product at all. For the meantime, i bought the whole package, to see the full potential of Beauche. I&#x27;ll be reviewing this product again anytime soon...</li>
    <li> Tried this product cause it was recommended by a dear friend of mine. I had problems with my combination skin so around my tzone I noticed that&#x27;s where unusually break out. I had acne scars that were lightly visible and uneven skin tone. But after 3 weeks of using this beauche product pack OMG!! At first I thought I wanted to kill my dear friend cause the &amp;#34;exfoliating cream&amp;#34; felt like a million baby needles were stabbing my face for 5-15 min at least :( but she kept telling me &amp;#34;no pain no gain!!&amp;#34;. Lol. After 3 weeks of using this product I realize what they mean by saying having that baby clear skin face:) OMG!! I think every time I look in a mirror I would stop and be amazed how pretty that person is in the mirror lol I&#x27;m conceited Hahahahaha:) and I probably take a million selfies a day after that:)</li>
    <li> I was so disappointed since I didn&#x27;t received the 2 sets of beauche skin care that I ordered the last time even though I got a refund its frustrating to experienced this kind of situation since I&#x27;ve been ordering the same products for a long time.I hope this would not happen again in my future orders.Thank you.</li>
    <li> fast shipping and I love the product</li>
    <li> this product really works. My skin has improved so much.</li>
    <li> I want to order 6 piece beauche international</li>
    <li> This is the only skin care product that I will use forever!  Works like magic and gives you flawless skin!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost a week now and I must tell you, it&#x27;s not a fake.  It really WORKS :-)  Love this products and their customer service is excellent.  Shipment is fast too!  No need to wait for a month to arrive, not like others :-)&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Beauche!!!</li>
    <li> My aunt used this product and gave her amazing result. I purchased the set and followed the instruction. I have combination skin, my skin wasn&#x27;t bad yo start with, my main problem was my scars from old acne. This product broke me out, I gave it a month hoping it&#x27;ll get better. It never did, I stopped using it for 2 weeks now. My skin is still recovering.</li>
    <li> I only gave 4 stars because the bottle of the toner was leaking &amp; there was more than 1/3 of the liquid that  was wasted.</li>
    <li> The soap is wonderful...the creams have terrible ingredients that are bad for you....buy the soap, not the creams!</li>
    <li> very effective using this for 5 years now...</li>
    <li> I bought some expensive facial care system that does not work. This is the only one that really satisfy my needs in facial care. It made my facial scar almost disappear and made my skin lighter and the oilyness is gone. Really love the product... I even recommend it to my sister who has the same problem and told it really made a difference.. I love this product.</li>
    <li> VERY Expensive and all the creams had just little amout in the jar!</li>
    <li> Effective in my skin really great.....</li>
    <li> great choice, my wife likes this product</li>
    <li> A coworker of mines recomended this product for my acne problem and after just one week of using this product i could see the difference in my skin. My acne looked dried up n my skin just looked smoother. Even after 2 days i could see a difference. I have been using it for 3 weeks now. I would definately recommend this product and i will definately continue using it.</li>
    <li> It makes my Face Glowing and pinkish! Theres a little stinging and itchy and breakouts at first but its tolerable its worth it no pain no gain</li>
