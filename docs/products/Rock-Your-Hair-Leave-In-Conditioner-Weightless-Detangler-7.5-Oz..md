      <li>THAT&#x27;S WHAT WAS IMPORTANT.</li>
      <li>It is fantastic for her hair.</li>

      <li>The bottle is so fun and cute.</li>
      <li>I try to stick to vegan, cruelty free options when it comes to hair care</li>
      <li>got it for free as part of a promotional package and have used it all</li>
      <li>originally tried at a hair show</li>
      <li>Maybe people with thinner, straight hair would have better results with it.</li>
      <li>This is my absolute favorite product from ROCK YOUR HAIR.</li>
      <li>SO MY HAIR IS FUNNY !  </li>
      <li>Just love this stuff and can&#x27;t find it anywhere local.</li>
      <li>she wakes up and her hair is soft and snarl free.</li>
      <li>My hair is quite long, very fine, and have quite a bit of it.  </li>
      <li>She was very excited about this product andit definitely didnt deliver</li>
      <li>Not the best I&#x27;ve tried, it showed little benefit after hair dried.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Price is reasonable too.</li>
      <li>I gave it a four because I didnt really like the smell</li>
      <li>I really like that it is a leave in conditioner and detangler all in one.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair very manageable</li>
      <li>I really use this every day on my hair and my daughters.</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>I bought this for my niece who has very curly hair and always would be upset that we had to brush out her hair after shampooing,  </li>
      <li>My wife says it leaves her hair very greasy</li>
      <li>This product was decent, but it did not de-tangle as well as I was hoping.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>It really makes your hair soft.</li>
      <li>, the bottle design is very teeny-bopper, looks kind of cheap on the counter with the hot pink and fake rhinestones.  </li>
      <li>I got this for my 2 year old who has curly hair ...</li>
      <li>Want soft hair?</li>
      <li>my 7 year old daughter likes it?</li>
      <li>Makes hair too soft for me.</li>
      <li>Most of the ones I have used make my hair feel heavy and greasy especially the next day.</li>
      <li>After a few sprays of this in my hair, the comb goes right through it and it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling greasy or oily after.</li>
      <li>I love the entire line but this amazing detangler works miracles on my mega long hair that gets hopelessly tangled with bad knots!</li>

<li> I use this as a detangler after towel-drying my hair and my normally difficult to get through hair is combed through quite easily.  </li>
<li> I guess my only reason for giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is I wish it was specifically made not only for detangling/conditioning wet hair but also as a moisture aid to refresh dry hair, like a wet or dry hair leave in conditioner product.</li>
<li> MY HAIR IS VERY LONG AND CURLY .I</li>
<li> I have very long, curly hair</li>
<li> It detangles but seems to dry my hair out a bit</li>
<li> AM BLACK AND ITALIAN</li>
<li> she always complains when we brush it.. dry or wet.</li>
<li> then it dried and my hair feels flat and oily.  </li>
<li> AND A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY.  </li>
<li> - I would &amp;#34;repurchase&amp;#34; once I work my way through my other backups.</li>
<li> I sometimes also spray it on my dry hair (even though it doesn&#x27;t specify to do this in the instructions) for a little extra moisture, but I&#x27;m not sure that it works</li>
<li> My hair usually falls flat in any humidity.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t use much, only 4 to 5 pump mists for hair past shoulder length and this bottle lasted me about a month and a half.</li>
<li> so it&#x27;s almost impossible to find an adequate detangler for it.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little pricey</li>
<li> A little pricey.</li>
<li> I feel like it coats my hair with a layer of product (not in a heavy or sticky way) that keeps strands separate.</li>
<li> Works, a few sprays and tangles are gone.</li>
<li> This does not feel heavy or leave my hair greasy.</li>
<li> YOU GUYS HAVE IT A LITTLE CHEEPER!</li>
<li> If you get it on the floor ,it&#x27;s slick.  </li>
<li> This may be compared to a typical less expensive retailed product.  </li>
<li> No more painful comb outs!!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My granddaughter has very fine, curly hair.  After trying so many products we bit the bullet and bought this.  It is fantastic for her hair.</li>
    <li> Not the best I&#x27;ve tried, it showed little benefit after hair dried.  I prefer Paul Mitchell&#x27;s leave in , The Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the bottle design is very teeny-bopper, looks kind of cheap on the counter with the hot pink and fake rhinestones.  Passing on to a preteen.</li>
    <li> My wife says it leaves her hair very greasy and she gave it to her Sister who agreed and threw it away. She was very excited about this product andit definitely didnt deliver</li>
    <li> This product was decent, but it did not de-tangle as well as I was hoping. I really didn&#x27;t notice a significant difference in my hair&#x27;s condition, but it does have a great smell. Comparable to Miracle 7, sold at Sally&#x27;s beauty shops.</li>
    <li> Just love this stuff and can&#x27;t find it anywhere local. thanks</li>
    <li> I bought this for my niece who has very curly hair and always would be upset that we had to brush out her hair after shampooing,  this works great just spray it on and start brushing. It also doesn&#x27;t make your hair look oily. Great product.</li>
    <li> I try to stick to vegan, cruelty free options when it comes to hair care so I thought I&#x27;d try this. The bottle is so fun and cute. My sister is 10 and she loved it! It smells rashly good too. My husband smells my hair all of the tI&#x27;m now!  I don&#x27;t use much, only 4 to 5 pump mists for hair past shoulder length and this bottle lasted me about a month and a half. I really like that it is a leave in conditioner and detangler all in one. Good for kids as well. It really makes your hair soft.</li>
    <li> It detangles but seems to dry my hair out a bit</li>
    <li> I have very long, curly hair so it&#x27;s almost impossible to find an adequate detangler for it.  This is just so-so as a leave-in conditioner.  I compare it to Pantene, which I can buy at Walmart or Target.  It&#x27;s just ok.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.  Maybe people with thinner, straight hair would have better results with it.</li>
    <li> I JUST BOUGHT THIS TO GO WITH SEVERAL HAIR CARE ITEMS FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTER.  SHE LIKES IT SO I GUESS THAT&#x27;S WHAT WAS IMPORTANT.</li>
    <li> Great item, and is exactly as described!!  Would purchase this item again if needed, and would suggest it to anyone else looking for such an item!!!</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite product from ROCK YOUR HAIR. I love the entire line but this amazing detangler works miracles on my mega long hair that gets hopelessly tangled with bad knots! No more painful comb outs!!! LOVE!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff- originally tried at a hair show</li>
    <li> Nice scent. Doesn&#x27;t leave hair stringy or greasy like some products. Cute bottle. A little pricey.</li>
    <li> I got this for my 2 year old who has curly hair ... she always complains when we brush it.. dry or wet. Softer!!! Softer!!!! so I got this and spray it on after her bath and she doesn&#x27;t complain anymore! she wakes up and her hair is soft and snarl free. It&#x27;s a little pricey but it works :)</li>
    <li> My hair is quite long, very fine, and have quite a bit of it.  So, hence , I can only rate this product based on my situation.  From my perspective, this leave in conditioner  does not detangle nor does it dramatically condition my ends.  This may be compared to a typical less expensive retailed product.  Two stars for pretty bottling and pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> Does it work to detangle? Yes&lt;br /&gt;Does my 7 year old daughter likes it? Yes, it&#x27;s PINK!&lt;br /&gt;Price is reasonable too.</li>
    <li> used it after using their shampoo and it felt ok.  then it dried and my hair feels flat and oily.  would not used again.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best leave in conditioners I have used. Most of the ones I have used make my hair feel heavy and greasy especially the next day. This does not feel heavy or leave my hair greasy. It also smells good which is a perk since most don&#x27;t smell good either!</li>
    <li> My hair usually falls flat in any humidity.  This product helps it keep it&#x27;s life even in the rain.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I TRULY LOVE THIS ! MY HAIR IS VERY LONG AND CURLY .I AM BLACK AND ITALIAN SO MY HAIR IS FUNNY !  BUT I USE THIS ON MY HAIR AFTER I WASH IT!  AND I CAN COMB RIGHT THROUGH IT!! AND A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY.  LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! !!!  BUT IN THE SALON I PAID $20.00 SO I WAS HAPPY TO SEE THAT YOU GUYS HAVE IT A LITTLE CHEEPER!</li>
    <li> I really use this every day on my hair and my daughters. My hair looks great and shinny and her hair doesn&#x27;t get as tangled.&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping and good price.</li>
    <li> I gave it a four because I didnt really like the smell but that didnt stop me from buying another bottle the product is great its just the smell wasnt the best its was an okay smell</li>
    <li> Works, a few sprays and tangles are gone. Smells good.  If you get it on the floor ,it&#x27;s slick.  Makes hair too soft for me. I use it sparingly .  Want soft hair? You&#x27;ll love it.  I&#x27;m trying to encourage curl and body.</li>
    <li> After a few sprays of this in my hair, the comb goes right through it and it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling greasy or oily after.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t moisturize or condition my hair at all, but is a fantastic detangler. I feel like it coats my hair with a layer of product (not in a heavy or sticky way) that keeps strands separate. Makes my hair very manageable and I like that I can run my fingers through it. For reference, I have almost waist-length, color-treated asian hair and I shampoo 2x a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got it for free as part of a promotional package and have used it all - I would &amp;#34;repurchase&amp;#34; once I work my way through my other backups.</li>
