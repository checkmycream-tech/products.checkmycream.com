      <li>Love the Shimmer to the Shadow.</li>
      <li>Love the sparkle.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a stunning pigment and consistency.</li>
      <li>It goes on easily and stays on until you take it off.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s soft and pigmented and sparkly (who doesn&#x27;t love a good sparkle?)</li>
      <li>Not as strong as I was expecting,</li>
      <li>and you can easily smooth the creasing out with your finger and it looks good as new ,but</li>
      <li>The lasting power is great.</li>
      <li>This is a beautiful pink champagne color.</li>
      <li>but, you may like it for the shimmer if u are looking for a very light shimmer soft look!</li>
      <li>Lovely color very natural yet</li>
      <li>I really like it!!</li>
      <li>This is a particularly nice product if your eyes are a bit deep set as mine are.</li>
      <li>shimmery there is pretty much no color at all to the shadow, it will be great to put under my brows or if you want to have a super natural no makeup look, with still having a little shimmer on your lids, I do have the bronzed shade , and I love it ,</li>
      <li>but super pretty and very wearable!</li>
      <li>very pretty and stands out, but not too much color for wearing on the job</li>
      <li>Exactly what I remembered.</li>
      <li>It adds a nice sparkle to other makeup and gives me lots of compliments.  </li>
      <li>it almost looks like a new penny type color, so I was excited because any copper like color really makes my eyes pop</li>
      <li>for Infallible eye shadows are: pretty much just that they do crease through out the day , not a ton</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s super soft and pigmented.</li>
      <li>i really like this shadow.</li>
      <li>but I really like this one and wear it a lot.</li>
      <li>I don think its brand new bc</li>
      <li>But it looks very natural and shimmers.</li>
      <li>This eye shadow came in sealed and exactly the same shade as pictured.</li>
      <li>Most eye shadows that have any sparkle in them usually end up all over my face.</li>
      <li>If you have gotten infallible e/s before you know they are generally metallic finish shadows and this one is very wearable.</li>
      <li>I love the color but this kind of shadow has a tendency to crease, which I hate.  </li>
      <li>pretty colors , lasts a really long time, I have had my bronzed color for about 4 months</li>
      <li>Soft sparkly shade.</li>
      <li>It looks like it will last for a pretty long time.</li>
      <li>This is cute for a real subtle look its a little too light for my liking seems almost clear to me</li>
      <li>Although I did end up finding a longer lasting brand of the same color with more shimmer for just a few dollars more at &#x27;MicaBeauty&#x27;, so that was a bit disappointing that I had already bought this.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had this eye shadow for a long time now, use it frequently, and have barely made a dent in it.  </li>
      <li>and I use it pretty much everyday</li>

    <li> this is my favorite! I will never buy another eye shadow again.</li>
    <li> This eye shadow came in sealed and exactly the same shade as pictured. Great quality and color pay out every time.</li>
    <li> looking at this color online it almost looks like a new penny type color, so I was excited because any copper like color really makes my eyes pop, I was a little disappointed when I got it just because even though it is super shimmery there is pretty much no color at all to the shadow, it will be great to put under my brows or if you want to have a super natural no makeup look, with still having a little shimmer on your lids, I do have the bronzed shade , and I love it ,&lt;br /&gt;cons for Infallible eye shadows are: pretty much just that they do crease through out the day , not a ton and you can easily smooth the creasing out with your finger and it looks good as new ,but still a con&lt;br /&gt;PRO: pretty colors , lasts a really long time, I have had my bronzed color for about 4 months and I use it pretty much everyday and it hardly looks used at all.&lt;br /&gt;when I received this shadow there was no seal on the packaging at all, it does not look like it had been used but as I said from the color that I have had for a few months it barley looks used,</li>
    <li> i really like this shadow. it&#x27;s soft and pigmented and sparkly (who doesn&#x27;t love a good sparkle?) definitely not &amp;#34;infallible&amp;#34; on it&#x27;s own -needs a base under it. but super pretty and very wearable!</li>
    <li> My sister showed me this eye shadow about a year ago, and I immediately fell in love with it!  It is difficult to mess it up!  There are so many ways to apply it for a beautiful look; I like to use a brush, while my sister uses a cotton swab!  I have also used my finger before, and it still looks beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this eye shadow for a long time now, use it frequently, and have barely made a dent in it.  This eye shadow may seem expensive, but it will last you for years!</li>
    <li> Soft sparkly shade. Not as strong as I was expecting, but I think the picture does do it justice. It doesn&#x27;t stay on all day, esp in the heat, but long enough to wear.</li>
    <li> Most eye shadows that have any sparkle in them usually end up all over my face. The L&#x27;Oreal 24 hour eye shadow really STAYS on, the colors are beautiful and sparkly. No under-eye sparkles. Great shadow. Have purchased additional colors.</li>
    <li> Great Color!!!Great Fall Brown color.  Love the Shimmer to the Shadow. Add&#x27;s definition to any eye color. Will be buying again!!!</li>
    <li> Love the sparkle.  It adds a nice sparkle to other makeup and gives me lots of compliments.  Plus, it stays on all day.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have this color yet but I love these eye shadows! It does last all day! The trick is put a little concealer on your lid then the shadow. It works great!</li>
    <li> a good color for work. very pretty and stands out, but not too much color for wearing on the job</li>
    <li> This is cute for a real subtle look its a little too light for my liking seems almost clear to me but, you may like it for the shimmer if u are looking for a very light shimmer soft look! Great for first time make up wearers like teens!</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful pink champagne color. If you have gotten infallible e/s before you know they are generally metallic finish shadows and this one is very wearable. The shine seemed to fade after  few hours even with primer and that is why I knocked one star off but I really like this one and wear it a lot.</li>
    <li> Good and cheap! Perfect</li>
    <li> This color is a perfect neutral nude! The lasting power is great. And it&#x27;s super soft and pigmented.</li>
    <li> I love the color but this kind of shadow has a tendency to crease, which I hate.  I only took off one star because the creasing is probably just how my skin reacts to it.</li>
    <li> It hás the perfect color and sparkle!!! Realy perfect! It stays Very long! Loved it!!</li>
    <li> Ordered for my granddaughter.  She loves the product.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE! It&#x27;s a stunning pigment and consistency. I&#x27;m hooked. It&#x27;s a rosy gold with a shimmery look on the eye. Didn&#x27;t seem to crease and works well alone or with other shadows to create a smokey eye.</li>
    <li> very good, i love it. it is a great eye shadow and perfect as an undershadow before applying darker colors, it really shines all day.&lt;br /&gt;Great service from company.</li>
    <li> I really like it!! Although I did end up finding a longer lasting brand of the same color with more shimmer for just a few dollars more at &#x27;MicaBeauty&#x27;, so that was a bit disappointing that I had already bought this. But it looks very natural and shimmers. It is beautiful!!! It looks like it will last for a pretty long time.</li>
    <li> Product was loose and old not happy</li>
    <li> Exactly what I remembered. Excellent staying power and a great price. The color also gets a lot of compliments!</li>
    <li> This is a particularly nice product if your eyes are a bit deep set as mine are. It brings them out at the inner corner. The color is a bit lighter than the picture appears. It goes on easily and stays on until you take it off.</li>
    <li> I don think its brand new bc it wasnt sealed</li>
    <li> Lovely color very natural yet eye catching goes on smooth and stays on all day!</li>
