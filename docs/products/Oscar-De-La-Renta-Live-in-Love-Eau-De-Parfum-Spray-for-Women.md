    <li> My favourite fragrance!</li>
    <li> Product received and was a wonderful surprise.</li>
    <li> It was a gift from my best friend, and I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> Smells good last a long . Everybody around me likes it. Will buy it again</li>
    <li> Great product!! Great service!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my new 2 favorite perfume. The perfume it&#x27;s outstanding for people that love her perfume to last in her body,I do recommend it,a great gift to someone you love.</li>
    <li> Item exactly as promised and received quickly</li>
    <li> A gift for my daughter in law. She loves it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 22 and I have to say this was not my favorite. I got it right before Christmas and gave it to my mom, she loved it but wasent for me</li>
    <li> This was a gift and the one who received it loved it.</li>
    <li> Liv in Love Eau De Parfum actually did not live up to my expectation.  Although, the sample smell that you get in the mail, does not match perfectly and not quite as good,.  It is a bit too strong for my taste, but i will at least wear in off and on over a short period.  Did not spend alot for it.  Thank Goodness.</li>
    <li> I am Mrs. Frugal when it comes to well...everything. I am one to stock up on all the free inserts of perfume you get in magazines.  I got this perfume in one of my magazines and fell in love with the smell.  I said.. I don&#x27;t care how much it cost&#x27;s I need to buy this perfume.  That says something!</li>
    <li> A beautiful fragrance, and I love the design of the bottle.</li>
    <li> Live in Love is an aptly named fragrance from a man who truly knows women. It is has passionate overtones with sweet seductive undertones. I was prompted to buy this perfume after receiving an actual sample while in Lord and Taylor. It is fruity without the overbearing qualities of stronger perfumes. Most importantly, there was no allergic reaction. It is a wonderful scent to wear all year round.</li>
    <li> Well, I smelled it for the first time in a magazine and thought it was so pretty but when I checked online, it was way overpriced! Thankfully, a few years later when I was looking for a pretty and feminine scent to wear as my \\&quot;wedding perfume,\\&quot; this one still stuck in my mind. I was lucky to find it on amazon for a quarter of the price they were selling it at Macy&#x27;s and other Department stores!!! Crazy right?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The perfume itself is lovely, light and feminine. I think it&#x27;s better to wear in the warmer weather but I could see it working in the winter as well. It&#x27;s just so pretty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, it doesn&#x27;t have a STRONG scent so you may feel like it dissipates or fades throughout the day, but once in a while I get a wiff of it on myself, and boy is it pretty and classy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been wearing it to work and it&#x27;s a perfect, mild scent that doesn&#x27;t over-power the office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just lovely!</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the product. Had purchased at a retail store some months ago. Was glad to find it at a discounted price. I would use this process again.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my sister. She love it. thnx!</li>
    <li> I get compliments often when wearing this perfume. It&#x27;s a seductively light fragrance that is very enticing. A classic bold and confident scent. Will be replacing my bottle when it&#x27;s gone.</li>
    <li> Excellent perfume and present for my wife.</li>
    <li> Wonderful smell, great longevity. Type of perfume that can be worn for any occasion. Not strong or overpowering at all but lasts through most of the day. Love it.</li>
    <li> People are describing this as &amp;#34;green&amp;#34;.  Eh, not really. It&#x27;s a soft floral with an initially sharp edge that fades down quickly. Contrary to the experience of others, I find this lasts all day, and I use it very lightly. But I really like it as an everyday general perfume. It really is lovely, and smells like it should cost a lot more. The bottle is huge and I expect it to last well over a year with daily use.</li>
    <li> I cannot tell you what it smells like because I am not good at that, but this is my 2nd or 3rd bottle!</li>
    <li> This is probably the 6th or 7th bottle of this perfume I have purchased off Amazon. It is WAY cheaper here than in department stores (under $40 here versus almost $100 in stores!).  It is the same, quality product.  I always get lot of compliments on the fragrance.  It is clean, floral,and has a lot of &amp;#34;green&amp;#34;, fresh notes.  Even when I can no longer smell it on myself, people (both men AND women) tell me I smell really good. Shipping is always fast, regardless of who I order it from.  Would definitely recommend this scent if you like floral fragrances.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume. Purchased two, one for me and my sister loves hers as well.  I will recommend this to my friends.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my sister.  It&#x27;s a wonderful Spring-time fragrance.  Lovely, without being overpowering!  It&#x27;s a very nice scent.  I first smelled this in a magazine and liked it, but it smells much better out of the bottle, of course!  Happy to Live in Love!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok.  Not as I thought it would smell.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll stick to Dior in the future. I can&#x27;t smell the bergamot.</li>
    <li> I have won this perfume for quite some time and of the five or six perfumes that I wear (including Chanel #50) this is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;35</li>
    <li> aroma is sweet and refreshing recommend</li>
    <li> GREAT PERFUME  FAST DELIVERY THANKS A MILLIONS!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been purchasing this thru a dept. store. This is the exact product! No gimmick!  Would do it again!</li>
    <li> This item is the real deal, it was not a knock off or a fake. Thank you for making this item available and saving me a ton of money!</li>

    <li> One of my favorite fragrances. Romantic but sexy and alluring. I get asked what I am wearing anytime I go out wearing  this fragrance.</li>
    <li> This perfume is light, verdant and floral, finishing sweet with a hint of patchouli. It is a wonderful fragrance and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume! Its such a beautiful scent. Its not overpowering, very feminine, &amp; its strong enough to last all day.I get compliments every time I wear it. Very economic price &amp; it shipped in 3 business days ☺</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance!!!  Soft, floral scent.  Only wish it lasted longer.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS NEWER, TO ME, FRAGRANCE. IT IS LIGHT ENOUGH TO ADD TO THE ORIGINAL FRAGRANCE......WONDERFUL FRAGRANCE........WILL BUY THIS ONE AGAIN.....GREAT PRICE AS WELL!!!</li>
    <li> This has become my new favorite perfume. This was bought for me as a gift but I feel that the price is good for the product. Oscar De La Renta made a great scent.</li>
    <li> My current favorite scent it arrives on time and is the size as promised. I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> Clean, feminine scent.  Love it!</li>
    <li> a good scent. a light and flowery scent especially for summer but I wished it lasted longer</li>
    <li> I have tried many others but this scent keeps me coming back. It&#x27;s classy and sophisticated. Many people ask about it when I wear it. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This is a gift for my mom which she requested.  The price was awesome compared to the stores and it arrived very quickly. She will be happy.</li>
    <li> Excellent light scent for anytime of day.</li>
    <li> Ordered it, got it quick, and what we ordered was in the box as expected. Pretty simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon - your word count thing is stupid.</li>
    <li> This fragance is the perfect way to define how Oscar de la Renta make a statement of feminity.</li>
    <li> Just accidentally I found a sample of this perfume somewhere, put it on just to try and in a middle of the day was caught by an incredibly amazing scent that turned out to have come from my wrist where I put the perfume. The scent was so wonderful, so I bought the whole bottle, and since it&#x27;s an old scent, the price was awesome. I really like this smell, it&#x27;s fresh and a bit oriental. And very very sunny.</li>
    <li> I DONT LIKE THE SMELL. IS VERY STRONG FOR ME</li>
    <li> I LOVE this perfume!  It is a very clean, floral scent that lasts all day.  I get compliments every time I wear it.  I was purchasing from a department store for $98 + tax, so this is a steal!</li>
    <li> I bought this fragrance after following a woman on the Metro Link wearing this fragrance and I just had to ask what she was wearing.  It&#x27;s very soft and slightly floral...a good fragrance for spring/summer.  But it wears off quickly so I purchased the body lotion for an added layer of fragrance and would recommend doing that, plus the body lotion is very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love the scent, but that is subjective. Go to any department store and find out if you love it yourself. What sucks about this perfume is that the scent dissipates within a couple of hours. It&#x27;s not an all day scent, which bugs me.</li>
    <li> I purchased this perfume for my mom. She went shopping one day and bought this lotion. She went to local department stores and this perfume costs about $40-$50 more. This is a great deal and the perfume shipped really fast. I will purchase this again for her and will definitely recommend and use this seller. The perfume really does smell WONDERFUL! GREAT BUY!!!!!</li>
    <li> I first got turned on to this fragrece at the mall when shpping, I fell in love with it... It smells very &#x27;high end&#x27; and &#x27;Posh&#x27; everywhere I go people say how wonderful I smell!! I keep some in my case/bag all the time as I re-spray about every 3 hours.. thats the only down side it only stays strong for 3 hours...so get one for home and one for on the go.. so you can re-spray. -Many blessings :)</li>
    <li> Love it.  I used only a small amount and my friends tells me I smell good! :)</li>
    <li> This perfume smells so good. Its more of a girlie, floral, flirty perfume. Ill definitely repurchase once this bottle is over.</li>
    <li> I received a sample from birch box and feel in love with the scent. This price was a steal for the bottle size.</li>
    <li> Its great and it smells lovely, shipping took about 6 days.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff...I heard it was discontinued and I was happy to find it on Amazon..bought 3 bottles.....</li>
    <li> This perfume is out Of this world you can rally put web other perfume that costa hundreds AMD still this be the winner is femenine is soft is unique forma now con this will be muy Fragace forma spring AMD summer forma e ver thank you todo the vendor was fast deliver definate i will buy from himno again.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife at Christmas. After going to sim fancy stores I checked out Amazon and they had the best price for the size! Sure it doesn&#x27;t come with a fancy bag and lotion and other samples of things they want you to by but the sent is what your looking for! This is the real deal!</li>
    <li> Smell so good but the smell won&#x27;t stay longer. I won&#x27;t buy this item anymore</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of Live in Love - Oscar de la Renta is synonymous with great fashion and this perfume is no exception.  The packaging is so attractive and I love looking at the bottle on my dresser.  The perfume has wonderful aroma and I get many compliments on the scent.  Amazon is always great on delivery and this was no exception.  I will order more for sure.</li>
    <li> Very nice fragrance, especially for the hot, humid Mid-South summers.  Very green, fresh, and citrus type floral; appropriate for casual and formal occasions.</li>
    <li> Paired with the lotion the scent lasts all day. I&#x27;m wearing it now (12 hours after putting on) and I can still smell it. Many many compliments.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing. I love this perfume</li>
    <li> I just had to review this perfume. It smells so good. Not usually someone who buys expensive perfumes but this was a must have. I wear it everyday, it makes me feel super fancy even when dressed really casually. Scent is hard to describe but instantly likable.</li>
    <li> This was the best find of all!!! Was so upset when I checked all the department stores and was told that they do not make this anymore! So hope this lasts me for some time! Ladies, you want a lovely perfume that turns everyone&#x27;s head and gets lots of compliments, buy this!</li>
    <li> sorry I purchased this.</li>
    <li> I really do love the scent. It is fresh and light. It seems to dissipate quicker than I would like. But I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Lovely, it is a bottle of sunflowers. I get so many compliments on this perfume because it is so fresh and different! My boyfriend usually can find me a mile away blindfolded by the smell of my Chanel Mademoiselle but he loves this new scent. I got a sample of this from Macy&#x27;s or somewhere and thought I would try something new for Summer. It also looks beautiful on my vanity because of the bottle.</li>
