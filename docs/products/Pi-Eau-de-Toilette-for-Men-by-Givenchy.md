<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> MY HUSBAND SMELLS JUST FABULOUS-LOVE IT</li>
    <li> The buckle came broken in two pieces.</li>
    <li> Reorder this item regularly.  Scent is consistent, pleasant, and long lasting.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing Pi now for about 15 years and I am a woman. A week doesn&#x27;t go by that I am not asked what my fragrance is and how great it smells on me.      I have never been able to wear the floral scented colognes that most woman&#x27;s fragrances are - they give me a headache.  I find the fragrance of Pi just perfect - the fragrance is very calming, sweet and seductive - I am complimented by both men and women.      So ladies next time you think of buying Pi for the man in your life try it for yourself!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this cologne. The smell is wonderful and lasts a long time unlike some watered down versions you buy online.</li>
    <li> look no further. this cologne is hands down the most pleasing enticing and engaging scent i have ever worn. it is second to nothing.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best that I have purchased. I don&#x27;t know anyone who would not like this for a gift happy shopping</li>
    <li> The top note is not something I thought i was crazy about until I wear the cologne. The middle and base notes get better as it blends with my biochemsitry. The scent definitely last almost the whole day.</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance of this Eau de Toilette</li>
    <li> I have worn Pi by Givenchy for Men cologne spray for a number of years.  It has a distinctive, subtle fragrance, which I personally like.  If you are looking for a fragrance that is not overwhelming, but rather very pleasant I recommend Pi.  I received my recent Amazon order timely.  Bob</li>
    <li> It would be cheaper to buy baby oil and put that on your skin for about the same smell that this cologne gives.</li>
    <li> Very good fragrance. think sweet yet smokey vanilla. it&#x27;s much more complex than that but that would be the first thing to come to my mind. Givenchy is a very high end designer and this cologne reflects the sophisticated taste.</li>
    <li> I love collecting colognes and this is one of my new favorites. Saw it at Macy&#x27;s for about $75 and came here to buy it for about half the price. It is musky and has a woody, leather, baby powder incense smell to it, if that makes any sense.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is very appealing to women.  Just a little turns heads.  It is priced much less through Amazon.</li>
    <li> One of my favorites, I spray once on my chest the smell stays on me all day.</li>
    <li> This was a very good deal.  I had been wanting some of this for a long time but it was way too expensive.  The price was awesome.  I will definately be doing business again.</li>
    <li> this product smell very good, I like it. my wife gift me that fragrances, because she like it. you can use at anytime, in the day or night.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading all the positive feedback. When I got it and put a little on I almost threw up it stunk so bad. I don&#x27;t know what was in my bottle but whatever it was I sure do not want anymore of it. Whatever it was stunk me up my shirt up my hand up and I tried to wash it off over and over again but the funk would not leave me alone. Have you ever been to the zoo and stood close to the monkey cage and you start to smell that funky musty pissy smell. Well it kind of smelled like that but worse. I think someone sold me monkey piss with a hint of monkey ass cheese. Sorry Pi By Givenchy For Men but I want to attract the laidies not a female orangutan. Bye bye monkey piss. Nothing against Pi Givenchy For Men I&#x27;m sure it is a good product but I feel I was ripped off and sold a fake product.</li>
    <li> This was a gift and I was very happy by the short amount of time it took to get this item and the price was very reasonable.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and price for this size.</li>
    <li> Received it on time,i am very satisfied with my purchase, reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I think that the scent from this cologne is wonderful.  I have received nothing but positive compliments, after applying it.  Some women have even come within close proximity just to inhale the aroma.  I find that the supply is exhausted quickly, therefore, it may not be the most cost effective product.  It does, however, get the job done because it has gravitational pull to most people who catches a contact!</li>
    <li> i buy his fragrance for myself. i think this scent can be used by both men and women as it is soft and quite nice.</li>
    <li> This is a very earthy and potent scent.  For those who like the citrus tones in many sport oriented colognes, this is not one of those.  I use Allure for men.  It has a subtle woodsy elements.  Pi is much stronger and would probably stand up well against tobacco smoke.  This strikes me a scent that would be a home in Middle East, but I have no basis for this intuition other than it is not like most European colognes.</li>
    <li> Many men like that musky-over-bearing-should-be-after-shave smelling designer crap.  Wrong.  Men should wear what women like because guess what?  They&#x27;re the ones that have to smell us.    Givenchy Pi is the best cologne I have worn.  I&#x27;ve been wearing for over 5 years now and every time I wear it, I receive compliments.      Why it is definitely a cologne, it&#x27;s subtle.  It lasts long.  It&#x27;s sweet smelling with just a kick of spice to it.  In my opinion the best fragrant combination and at a decent price.  I want to extend my thinks to the lady at the Lazaraus counter for giving me a tester back in &#x27;05.</li>
    <li> The best cologne I&#x27;ve ever owned! It&#x27;s completely different from anything I&#x27;ve ever smelled before, it&#x27;s very complex. I recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> Nice smelling perfume and it will last the whole day...I love it and bought it more as a gifts too..</li>
    <li> This is a quality, and good smelling, cologne for men under $100. Recommended by women, your girlfriend will like it! Not fruity or cheap like so many on the market. You&#x27;ll have to go to an \\&quot;upscale\\&quot; Neiman Marcus store to get better, and it&#x27;ll be over $100. Been there, done that!</li>
    <li> This is it guys. You won&#x27;t smell like a urinal cake (even your best friends won&#x27;t tell you) with Pi. I am NOT a heavy user of colognes but this is great. The smell is somewhat vanilla and if you use it sparingly women really respond to it. EVERYONE I let smell or try this loves it and that opinion has been consistent for 8 yrs now.    And guys less is more. If you are deluded into thinking splashing on the old toilet water is going to make you irresistible STOP. Where the cologne don&#x27;t let it wear you. Remember if you wanna get laid you have to let the lady breathe.</li>
    <li> My first review, so bare with me...  so, i purchased my first bottle of the stuff about 10 years ago(i use it sparingly). finally running out. did it go bad/stale? i doubt it. still smells amazing and is just as long-lasting as when i bought it. i did store it properly, so who knows... that&#x27;s besides the point. i needed a new bottle to replace my last one. i was kind of worried about it being fake, based on a few reviews i&#x27;ve read. i pulled the trigger and bought it through amazon...  got it today.   i looked up a few videos on how to tell fake colognes to see if this was real.   i questioned my purchase because my original bottle(3.3oz) had the Pi symbol towards the bottom of the glass. the one i received(also 3.3oz) had a larger Pi symbol towards the top of the glass. also, the new cologne had a slightly darker tint. i&#x27;ve read that Givenchy had a few different bottle designs for Pi and mine was congruent with all the pics i have seen.   1.) the packaging looks legit. has all the official Givenchy logos/stamps etc. ALTHOUGH, there were parts of the top folding tab on the box that were ripped off by cutting with a razor blade, kind of like when u remove labels from cardboard. idk what that&#x27;s all about. probably manufactures rules of resale and UPC stuff. shrugs.  2.) i see the bottom of the box has a barcode (some/most? fakes dont have an actual barcode, although it IS easy enough to print one).  3.) there is a serial number stamped into the box, 4 characters long, along with a percentage stamped below that. most fake productions would not spend the money for a stamping machine).  4.) the bottle shape, design, size were exactly the same. to the last detail.  5.) the bottom of the bottle has the SAME 4 digit serial number LASER ETCHED into the bottle. again, fake productions would almost certainly not go to such lengths to make a fake. they want cheap production with maximum profit.  6.) comparing the scent from my almost depleted bottle with my new one, the new oneis a tad stronger but has the SAME fragrance, tones, and aromatics.  so there, thats how i was assured my bottle was real. and if i missed anything, feel free to comment. this isn&#x27;t a 100% foolproof way to determine fakes, it&#x27;s just enough to put my mind to rest. also, this doesnt apply to EVERY fragrance out there, but it could be used as a reference.  lastly, ENJOY YOUR Pi! THE LADIES LOVE THIS STUFF!!! i&#x27;ve gotten countless compliments when i do wear it.  i hope this has helped you.</li>
    <li> After going through all the favorites out there, this is The One! Plus, it comes in a beautiful bottle. Goes great with Woman&#x27;s Givenchy Amarige, which is my signature fragrance, and has been since it&#x27;s introduction!</li>
    <li> Good product, I recommend it 100%, savory aroma to seduce a beautiful woman. Shop responsible and attentive, I recommend it. .</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance, only wish it would last a bit longer when sprayed. That would win the 5 stars</li>
    <li> It is a cologne that has received much acclaim, and I must say, deservedly. The smell itself is rather easy on the nose, and it does last a while on the body with just three or four sprays. All in all, a great cologne to wear, and definitely one for your personal collection if you are a connoiseur of colognes!</li>
    <li> I ready joy the long lasting lite vanilla, spice citrus and woodsy aroma of this cologne. This cologne works well for day or evening. You will not have to worry about a too powerful fragrance with Pi. One will receive many compliments during the day.</li>
    <li> Love Pi. Givenchy does have some nice newer products but I still love this one on my husband too. Great price, fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I got exactly what I expected and received it faster then I thought I would.  I love the cologne and the packaging the the cologne came in was very solid and secure.  Overall this was a great purchase and I have nothing bad to say about the product or the delivery or the entire process.</li>
    <li> I  thought it was a womens scent, smells like a lighter version of Obsession! But I love and I am gonna wear it even though I&#x27;m a women! Plain and simple!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite colognes. Its so different from the other colones he wears. It is soft,warm and sweet without smelling girly. He calls it my kryptonite because it smells so good to me I love when he wears this.</li>
    <li> My wife bought this for me for christmas and I really like it. It lasts a really long time and my wife goes crazy for the smell. I totally recommend this cologne is anyone who likes smooth,subtle smells.</li>
    <li> I was thrilled with the service with my order arriving several days ahead of time and in pefect condition. I&#x27;ll definitely use this service again.</li>
    <li> My husband wanted me to order this for him after sampling it at a local department store.  It works really well with his body chemistry and smells really nice.  On him, it smells really clean.  It is not overpowering.  The bottle is also really nice.  He now wears this everyday.</li>
    <li> Good product good place to buy it from. Shipped out fast and packaged good. Would buy items from them again</li>
    <li> I am a woman, but I love using it on myself, just because I love to smell it. It lasts so long, I just sprayed some last Saturday, and today is Thursday, I still can smell it from my coat!!</li>
    <li> This is the second bottle of this spray for me. I think it is one of the best smelling sprays available.</li>
    <li> Timely delivery and the cologne is great.</li>
    <li> My hisband has always used this and will not try anything else.  Bought it as stocking stuffer for Christmas, which he was totally thrilled.</li>
    <li> I love this smell and I always owned it. One of my friends smelled it on me and wanted one. So I bought it for him as a gift. I recommend anyone who wants to buy it.</li>
    <li> This product was sold &amp; shipped by Amazon. Bottle box was tampered including barcode. EDT has no smell at all. I have taken few picutres of the box before ditching the entire bottle. Not even worth as a car air freshner. I will upload some of the images.</li>
    <li> Back in September 2010, while going through a batch of cologne that belonged to my late father, I found Givenchy Pi. Having never heard of this particular brand of cologne before (I was new to fragrances at the time, having built an affinity for colognes over the past year), I sniffed the atomizer of the 1 oz bottle. I was intrigued. I took a shower, and applied some afterward. The warm, spicy scent of vanilla hit me. I instantly loved it. Time ensued, and I wore the rest of the cologne out as winter passed. By the time I had finished the rest of the cologne, I wanted to find it again.  Upon finding it on Amazon, I ordered it immediately. I wore it, wore it, and wore it some more. Things seemed different, though. The Pi from Amazon seemed less potent. The projection wasn&#x27;t as strong and the cologne&#x27;s longevity didn&#x27;t last as long as the other bottle. This concerned me, but nonetheless I still have continued to enjoy this cologne, even the one I received from Amazon. Amazon is a reputable seller, but for whatever reason, the version of Pi I received straight from the actual Amazon website seems less of the last one I used.  I recommend Pi to those who are inclined to enjoy sweet scented fragrances. It&#x27;s sweet, but it&#x27;s manly. I&#x27;ve received a plethora of compliments from girls (in their 20s, probably). For whatever reason, though, the projection and longevity I get out of the bottle I received from Amazon is a little disappointing, and that&#x27;s what is holding me back from rating the product five stars.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered ,golly I love this stuff gonna try some of givenchy other cologne&#x27;s for sure if anyone has recommendation feel free thanks!</li>
    <li> Excellent price.  Less then a smaller bottle at Target.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the real deal completely satisfied especially since I told a friend I bought a new bottle and he said he had purchased one awhile back offline so asked to see it the bottle was the same but the color looked like pee and the smell was so diluted how he didn&#x27;t realize it I couldn&#x27;t tell ya lol</li>
    <li> This is a very good scent....been out quite a while but it&#x27;s my first time wearing it.  I get good longevity out of this, over 8+ hours...projection is good, I&#x27;ve gotten compliments throughout the entire time.  This is a oriental spice frag that can be worn in most any setting and fall and winter are the primary seasons(however I would still d spring myself)  I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to purchase again, if you get a chance to buy just do it....</li>
    <li> I use three types of fragrances and PI by Givenchy is really me.&lt;br /&gt;Like most fragrances, is smooth and women like it.</li>
    <li> I recieved the cologne in a timely matter and it was just as I expected...and my husband loved it as a present.   Thanks for your great service!</li>
    <li> I was very happy with the price and quality of this product. It arrived in a very timely manner.</li>
    <li> Givenchy’s Pi is 17 years old and still going strong in the fragrance arena.  Pi is a warm and inviting fragrance beautifully blended with notes of vanilla, tonka bean, almond, and the outdoors (woodsy).  It is refined, distinguished, and a fragrance worn by gentlemen, but yet has a “softness” side that offers great flexibility demonstrated by very few fragrances.  Without question, Pi can be worn to formal outings, but offers that flexibility to also be worn in more casual settings. Further, pricing is fantastic and should be a staple fragrance in any collection – large or small – and definitely a safe blind buy.  Performance is above average, lasting 6-8 hours on me and much longer on clothing – all with projection/sillage at arm’s length or greater.  If you are not already sold on the fragrance, you will love the design of the bottle.  It will definitely be a conversation piece in your collection.  Nicely done, Givenchy.  My final tally for Givenchy’s Pi is 4.2 stars out of 5 stars with an endorsement to add to your collection.  On a personal note – when I wear Pi I am reminded of my favorite uncle (“Uncle Buddy”) and the good times shared – some fragrances will do that – like an old friend or family member that returns periodically to remind you of the past and fond memories.  Enjoy your day and happy fragrance hunting…</li>
    <li> Awesome scent. Relaxing and luxurious, Great on vacations.</li>
    <li> Excellent cologne. I get many compliments yet or people ask &amp;#34;what is that you&#x27;re wearing&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> My husband LOVED this birthday gift</li>
    <li> This is the only fragrance that I like for my husband to wear.  For the most part it smells good on him and I do not get an allergic reaction to the smell.  Also I just love the way it smells on him.</li>
    <li> This is the best perfume I ever have. I am on my second bottle in 5 years. It smells so good.</li>
    <li> I ordered the product on Monday and got it on Thursday, just as I was told it would arrive. It was safely wrapped and beautifully packaged. I had run out of my mini that I had bought two years ago (first fragrance I ever bought with my own money) but was intimidated by the price at department stores. Lucky I found it on here for half! It smells just as it always has: brilliant. This is definitely not a fake; it&#x27;s the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance itself may be my favorite of all time. It was marketed for men but I more so consider it a unisex fragrance, for the dry down heavily incorporate sugar, tonka bean, almond, and vanilla which are not commonly used in men&#x27;s cologne. The top and middle notes are a bit more masculine and quite sensual (I always get tons of compliments on this fragrance. Even my mother told me I smell &amp;#34;sexy,&amp;#34; which is kind of creepy when you think about it.) But the base is the ultimate oriental woody gourmand lover&#x27;s dream. Perfect for cold weather, but it is so complex and beautiful it could be worn year round by anyone confident enough in it. An absolute work of art. I recommend this beauty to all of my friends, both male and female.</li>
    <li> MY husband and I love this cologne. The scent is really nice. Would recommend anyboby to buy, you will love it.</li>
    <li> i have to spray like 3 to four times a day of this to feel it, the smell goes away after an 30 mins.. im so mad and you cann&#x27;t return it so it sucks i should of went to the mall but guess im to lazy should of read the comments also 02/19/2012.</li>
    <li> 3rd time is not the charm. This is my 3rd attempt at Pi and my last... I love the scent, it just fades away to soon. As opposed to Armani Code which lasts and lasts and lasts... Guess I&#x27;ll stick with Armani Code.</li>
    <li> the scent it not to strong and not to soft. just right</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this cologne. So perfect, not overwhelming. I bought it for my husband for Father&#x27;s Day. He sprayed some on immediately after he opened it. He likes it, most importantly is that I love it</li>
    <li> I have been using Givenchy Pi for over a decade and will not change it for anything in the world. In fact I tried and was very disapointed with the others. Even within the Givinchy brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the suttle scent that is very refreshing without being too overbearing or powerful. I have had guys and gals just lean in and smell me over and over as they can&#x27;t get enough of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
    <li> I like the smell but it is hard to get out of the bottle</li>
    <li> While in total agreement with all the positive reviews of PI COLOGNE, and a long time user of PI COLOGNE, let me offer one word of warning to those who purchase the product online.    There are many, many online sources for buying fragrances. In a few instances, we have found the lowest prices to be found at web sites that have sold us out of date merchandise. Both my wife and I have been disappointed to make a fragance purchase online, but when used, did not have long lasting impact hoped for when bought.    Our solution?    Call the web site directly, and ask when the product was produced, when it arrived at their warehouse, and how long it has been in their inventory. When we did this, we got FRESH PRODUCT. When PI COLOGNE is fresh, the fragrance lasts all day long with a subtle and pleasing aroma. A great product..........we agree with the review that called PI one of the five greatest of all time.</li>
    <li> This cologne has been around for about 10 years and only a select few last that long.  I&#x27;ve tried many different men&#x27;s cologne&#x27;s but PI by Givenchy is still my favorite.  Try it, you&#x27;ll like it.  I guarantee.....</li>
    <li> Excellent service and product!</li>
    <li> Original product, arrived in time pack or smells all day is delicious</li>
    <li> Present for my dad and he loved it. it smells great and it was a great price for this bottle.</li>
    <li> I remember my dad always referring to a womans special love as cake...lol...  Well men who where PI, will most def. take the cake...</li>
    <li> Stores like sephora macys and ulta have this for 78 bucks, I got it for 45. what a great Deal.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000C1VX6M Pi By Givenchy For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.3 Ounces]] I placed the order on Tues. 4/7 and it arrived perfect on Wed. 4/8 via UPS.  Their service is remarkable.  The product is in original wrapping and in mint condition.  Excellent timing.</li>
    <li> It was amazing. Got here on time and everything. My father loved it. This is his cologne and he said it was perfect. Very satisfied,</li>
    <li> I have loved this sent since I lived in France.  The price was attractive.  I get compliments all the time.</li>
    <li> As always, my husband -- and I  :-)  -- LOVED the Pi !</li>
    <li> Givenchy Pi is that fire! This fragrance has to be in the top 5 of all-time.</li>
    <li> This Eau de toilette sell so good i cant even ever imagined, Givenchy is always with good Perfumes. xo xo</li>
    <li> It came quick, didn&#x27;t see a receipt I dint think, but I bought for a friend and he was happy to receive it</li>
    <li> Love the product, but the bottle cap was broken</li>
    <li> it smells so delicious i don&#x27;t even know what to say. it last a long time too and is a big bottle. Bought from Amazon not a third party. smelt the one at kohls and this one from Amazon is the real deal and way cheaper plus free freight. I believe kohls charges close to $60 and this one cost bout $46. I spray damn near everything with it. just one spray is all it takes. next I wanna try Greenergy from Givenchy.</li>
    <li> Pi is ny husband&#x27;s signature scent and is complimented on it frequently. I hope Givenchy doesn&#x27;t stop making it. When he lijes something it&#x27;s hard fir him to change.</li>
    <li> This is the best-smelling cologne for men I have ever had the privilege of enjoying. I have bought it for two different men in my life now and they both love it, too. Yummy!!</li>
    <li> Arrived early and everything was as expected.  Great fragrance at a great price.  Can&#x27;t beat that. Purchased with Givenchy&#x27;s Xeryus Rouge, another great fragrance.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> My &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; favorite of all times!!!</li>
    <li> I had adidas moves before this eau de toilette spray. I wanted to change my spray,because adidas moves smell great, but just 1-2 hours.I chose Pi By Givenchy.It&#x27;s smell great,has very nice bottle,and Amazon&#x27;s price and service are excellent.In first,Pi had too strong smell for me, but after 10-15 minuts change to nice scent of sandalwood and patchouli.</li>
    <li> Funny story, I was at a local store in the mall shopping one day, about 8 years ago. I had bought my usual Obsession. I work in and with construction workers all day, so a light spray is all I ever use. The young woman at the cologne counter asked me if I had tried Givenchy PI. I&#x27;m not trying to be some highly cultured guy here, \\&quot;Tried it? I can&#x27;t even say that\\&quot;. She handed me a whole bag of the samples of Givenchy PI and told me to try it out since it reminded some of a lighter, more masculine Obsession.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought nothing of it, but as soon as I tried it, I loved it. My wife at the time, I was only about 24, she hated it! Oh, it wasn&#x27;t because she really hated it, it was because she was a jealous type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, so fast forward, divorce, and I swear to you all, she stole one of my shirts and sprayed Givenchy PI all over it! Over the next few years, we went back to being at least friends and about once a week she would stop by and ask me to spray the shirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure that doesn&#x27;t say much for me, she let me go, but not the smell. Needless to say, I moved on, got married to a different lady, and my ex no longer comes by to get me to spray the shirt for her. I could make this a review riddle and ask if you know why, but since I am really trying to tell how great this cologne is, I will tie up the loose strings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I married the woman from the cologne counter that gave me the Givenchy samples, and my ex, being a friend by then, came to our wedding, where my new wife, the cologne saleswoman, gave her a box of Givenchy samples so she would stop coming by to have me spray the shirt! Oh and yeah, this stuff is much better fresh. My ex says the samples don&#x27;t smell near as good as the bottle I have. Of course, the samples were old and that is how my current wife was able to give her a whole box of the samples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moral of the story, this cologne is loved by women. To this day, I am asked at grocery stores, gas stations, restaurants, what I am wearing by women and men always ask, \\&quot;Hey man, come here, what kind of cologne is that? Smells good\\&quot; you know, all secretive like, like they don&#x27;t want any other men hearing me tell them the name of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other moral is current wife still will spite ex-wife, even if it just outdated Givenchy samples!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my yearly presents from my wife during the holidays usually and one that I would recommend to all men for themselves or to women to buy for their man. In ending, fellas, if you ever thought cologne was too feminine or too anything, don&#x27;t do it with this one. Try it out, you&#x27;ll mostly likely love it and the responses you get from it.ways ask, \\&quot;Hey man, come here, what kind of cologne is that?

    <li> I have been a Pi by Givenchy wearer now for well over 10 years and I have to say that it is still my favorite scent. Since Pi is a relatively old scent by Givenchy it is becoming harder and harder to find the 3.3 ounce spray size at a reasonable price. Most of the malls that carry Pi do so in gift set format. These gift sets typically come with lotion, arm deodorant or shaving cream, but the cost of these sets rise to well over $80. It&#x27;s tough for me to justify paying $80 when all I really want is the cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But of course like always, if you are ever looking for something that is obscure or hard to find, there is a great chance that Amazon.com has it. In the case of Pi by Givenchy, Amazon.com saved the day. They have the 3.3 Ounce bottle at a really reasonable price (approx. $42). It is much cheaper than the prices I have seen at some of the cologne outlets in the mall and like always Amazon.com shipping got the product here within 3 days (standard).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this product is well worth the price point!</li>
    <li> This EDT is great, I&#x27;ve had it for years so it deserves my  5 stars without hesitation and in advance. I received it yesterday and the swinging plastic piece of the tip arrived broken. It must has been broken before it was shipped because the packaged was very well protected by Amazon. Don&#x27;t buy from that vendor. You have been warned.</li>
    <li> Love it. Not a bad price for the huge bottle.</li>
    <li> This is one of my all time favorite colognes that my husband wears. He didn&#x27;t know if he would like it at first, but it grew on him quickly.</li>
    <li> What more is there to say? OK, Ill say it again...every time he wears it, I want to make babies with him.</li>
    <li> Smells so much like play dough.  Its not a bad smell but for me, its not very wearable.  More suitable for females.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome fragrance !!! I receive many complements everytime i wear it...Its definitely a hit with the ladies</li>
    <li> If you like vanilla or cake you will love this. It is sweet without being feminine or too strong .</li>
    <li> I like to wear this cologne when going out with my friends, its smell is smooth and I&#x27;ve received many compliments on it already. It last a decent amount of time too. I also have the Givenchy Pi Neo which also smells great. But this one is a bit more elegant and will capture more attention than Neo. Its not musty at all. Go to the mall and sample it if skeptical, that&#x27;s how I got hooked on it, give it a second to settle on your skin and your realize you must have it. You cant beat the price either.</li>
    <li> It is not good product. Original one is amazing but this one smells bad, like fake one. Do not buy it here. Go to the store</li>
    <li> very good&lt;br /&gt;execelente the product, purchasing and shipping geestion.&lt;br /&gt;I congratulate</li>
    <li> Pi is a wonderful fragrance for a man - especially one who loves mathematics. The deal I received through Amazon was especially sweet. It was a perfect Christmas gift for myself.</li>
    <li> I recently bought this product through Amazon after having received a sample of the cologne at a retail store. I cannot say or share enough about this cologne and Amazon.com.  First, the cologne: I like colognes and over the years have had very many different favorites. Pi, however, was a fragrance I&#x27;ve not tried until recently. It has a great, distinctive, strong but not too strong scent that exudes a touch of class and sophistication. It&#x27;s mature but not old - young but not trendy. I had already received very many compliments on it. It&#x27;s my new favorite already!  Now on to Amazon: GREAT customer service, Amazon! I ordered this product and qualified for super-saving shipping. Honestly, I thought this would protract delivery HOWEVER, I&#x27;m amazed at how quickly Amazon got the product to me. I had the product within 3 days of ordering! I&#x27;ve bought a lot of things through various e-tailers, however, Amazon, in my experience, consistently ranks #1 in terms of customer service and price. Great job, Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely excellent service from the seller&lt;br /&gt;. Exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance! Been using it for years and very satisfied with it. Hope they never stop making it.</li>
    <li> I already knew the fragrance, so I gave to my husband and I love it. It has sweet and wood mixtured , also a pinch of vanilla</li>
    <li> Vanilla Vanilla Vanilla... gorgeous bottle and amazing scent, recommend it for you who love sweet perfumes, intresting evening with your other half</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my husband.  I love when he wears this cologne.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Long lasting, and my wife thinks its really nice. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this scent, and it&#x27;s a better price than the stores</li>
    <li> Im not happy at all ! Is not what i was expecting, the smell goes away easily :(</li>
    <li> I bought it for my boyfriend for his birthday he just love its.  It is he Fav. I even love it so much while he away i sneak put some one.</li>
    <li> very sweet odor  just like the bottle sold in Macy&#x27;s but much cheaper price</li>
    <li> Givenchy for Men, a cologne, is a very wonderful aroma on men.  Not only was this product pleasant, but was $20 cheaper than in any department store.  It came beautifully packaged and was sent timely.  I am Happy Shopper!!!  See me Shop Happy !!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this in stores and this one wasn&#x27;t as strong.....seems watered down.  Will not buy this item again at any price.</li>
    <li> I suspect the bottle I received its counterfeit. When compared to one I bought at the store the cap is different and also the liquid looked different. Hard to describe but definitely suspect. I will be buying next bottle in person.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s his favorite cologne to wear--and I love when he wears it.  We have a hard time finding it and the price is unbelievable.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my husband and we&#x27;re satisfied</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband after smelling it on a salesmen in a model home. It was such a different scent that I had to ask him what he was wearing so that I could buy it for my husband. He said that he received compliments on his cologne all of the time.  I can see why.  Once you smell this cologne, you will realize it is not like any other cologne that you have ever smelled. It is truly unique and in a class all it&#x27;s own. I love how it smells on my husband. It&#x27;s not too overpowering, it&#x27;s a real gentleman&#x27;s fragrance but also can pass for the rugged man&#x27;s fragrance, it&#x27;s very versatile in this arena. I think it can be worn to a sporting event or a black tie affair.</li>
    <li> beautiful fragrance..i got it for my husband</li>
    <li> This product does not have the same fragrance as the one from Dillards.  Amazon will not refund so I am stuck with this.  Not happy at all.</li>
    <li> Powerful, and good staying power, not a huge amount necessary.  But expensive and not quite worth the price.  I like the musky vanilla smell but there&#x27;s a little too much &#x27;perfumey&#x27; smell (I really don&#x27;t know how else to describe it) to make it work as either a sexy seductive or a manly power smell.  Just needs a little tweaking by the makers to be just right.</li>
    <li> Wonderful and quick spray for the day or evening!  And it comes in my sizes!</li>
    <li> my brother love this perfume so when he received it for it birthday you can imagine how trilled he was . He received in great condition and on time</li>
    <li> I wear Pi long times ago, I love it, but bought here at amazon the toilette spray and I don´t like the smell, it´s different, looks fake.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect gift for my brother.</li>
    <li> Anytime I wear this I get compliments!  I love the attention.</li>
    <li> What can I say. It smells divine.</li>
    <li> Pi by Ginvenchy For Men, has become my number one Favorite Cologne. It has an excellent Stay with you all Day or Night scent to it. I always like the Givenchy line, but Pi is my favorite by far.</li>
    <li> my favorite. great price</li>
    <li> This is one of my husbands favorites and it smell marvelous on him.  This  fragrance make you want to get closer and closer to your man, I love it!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite colognes that I buy for my husband.</li>
    <li> perfecto esa fragancia l he utilizado antes,lamentablemente me llego la tapa reventada,por lo demas bien ok</li>
    <li> i love this cologne. this was real for sure! great smell, last long time</li>
    <li> This smells like alcohol in a bottle.  Very disappointed.  Also, because it is flammable I am unable to return it. So this is a total loss of money for me.&lt;br /&gt; I have been buying Pi since 2000 and I know what it smells like, but this is definitely does not smell like Pi.  I have no idea if this is really made by Givenchy or not.  If it is, then it is a bad batch and keep that in mind.  I ordered in Sept 2014.</li>
    <li> My lifelong favorite fragrance, durability is unique.</li>
    <li> I heard so many things about it. Did a lot of research and finally settled on Pi, primarily because of its long-lastedness. However, how wrong I was. This does not last for even a couple of hours. Maybe it is this seller and the product is fake. Maybe, that&#x27;s how it is supposed to be. Either way, I will never buy this again and would recommend no one else does either.</li>
    <li> im not satisfy with this cologne,,wish i could send it back....not satisfy with this product not not satisfy for real</li>
    <li> Arthur was very pleased with his gift. I&#x27;m happy because he&#x27;s happy!!! Great job Amazon!!!!</li>
    <li> Smells great. I only buy items like this when they are sold by Amazon just for peace of mind knowing they have a much better chance of being authentic. This was sold by Amazon and smells potent unlike some of the cheap colognes you buy at a kiosk in the mall which sometimes smell watered down. Thanks Amazon for the cologne hookup.</li>
    <li> Smells right but does not last long as store bought. Spoke to store specialist and they said that it probably sat in the warehouse too long. When this happens the potency of the fragrance goes away. Somewhat disappointed. I would not advise buying online. Better to pay alittle more at Dillards, Macy&#x27;s, major retail stores where they send back outdated fragrances. This is the problem with buying online, these sellers buy the outdate stuff and resell it at discount. A ripoff for the consumer. Will not buy any fragrance online, flea markets, or discount stores again. Don&#x27;t overpay either. Some of the prices I have noticed are outrageous, almost double what you will pay at reputable retail stores.</li>
    <li> I have been using Pi since it first came out.I&#x27;ve ran out one time and bought Pi Neo,but did not like it.So I came here to get the real thing.(Pi)</li>
    <li> Save yourself the disappointment and head to the mall or nearest department store in order to purchase the real deal.  I&#x27;ve bought this product many times before in person from upscale retailers.  As such, I&#x27;m very aware of what the real deal smells like.  I was so happy when I received this product, only to be disappointed and upset by what I got.  The product was not the real deal and smelled nothing like what the authentic Pi fragrance smells like.  A few days later I went to the upscale dept store I normally go to and just repurchased the real stuff.  There is no confusing the smell of the real deal, which lasts and smells luscious, compared to this fake pine-sol smelling 3rd world nonsense that you will get when you buy it online from an unknown source.  STAY AWAY!!!</li>
    <li> This is awesome but bought this as a gift.  Somehow in shipping the top plastic gold top got broke but the spray was fine.  Think it was a one time fluke and would get again...</li>
    <li> This is the fourth time that I am purchasing Pi and  I always receive compliments. Just one spray in the air is enough. I however believe that a fragrance should match the chemistry of it&#x27;s user. For me it is 5 Star</li>
    <li> If you want to impress your lady friend buy this cologne.  I have received a lot of compliments.  I believe this must be Hank Moody&#x27;s cologne as well.  Great price compared to stores.</li>
    <li> I love the way it smells however there is a huge difference in the strength of the Givenchy bought from Amazon when compared to the one bought from the store. The scent is too weak and faint. Is it an old product setting on the shelf forever?</li>
    <li> the quality is very poor may be the product was to old .Do not smell .I used this product since 10 year. It look like a cope</li>
    <li> This is the best male cologne ever.  I have been wearing this for many many years.  Amazon had such a great deal on it.  A couple of years ago, I walked into the local Post Office and this woman turned to me and said, &amp;#34;OMG, you smell so good.  I could just eat you all up.&amp;#34;  I looked back at her and replied, &amp;#34;I know right!  I do smell good.&amp;#34;  Love this cologne.</li>
    <li> It smells like nothing...It&#x27;s a waste of my money.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband last Christmas and this Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;Scent is awesome, price was right.&lt;br /&gt;I think most men and ladies would love this.</li>
    <li> This costed me less than Macy&#x27;s($85?)offer and a lot less than Sephora&#x27;s price of $90.  The scent is unique, one I would recommend to someone who would does not enjoy musky scents that resemble Axe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I was looking for something suitable for a sensitive, shy, romantic, sophisticated  man who appreciates math; Givenchy Pi is exactly what I was looking for.  The scent is masculine yet has has a comforting hint of something sweet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon reading other comments, I hear that some fakes have been sent out.  I contacted amazon.com and brought this up, I was instructed to return if it was not the item I intended to buy.  Luckily, this item is legitimate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Test it out at a store that carries exquisite colognes, make sure this scent is the one you are looking for.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband to replace the bottle he finished. Its got a great smell too. Received it sooner than expected.</li>
    <li> Very fast delivered, great purchase for the price!</li>
    <li> Smells great, even better price point.</li>
    <li> Lovely perfume. This is my second time of purchasing this perfume and its the same smell and lasts long.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great luxury smell</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my son for Christmas.  He obviously likes it, and for me, the price was right.</li>
    <li> This is my second order for my son. Around the time when he was 16 yrs old he started to like cologne but he would wear that horrible, stinky body spray (starts with an \\&quot;A\\&quot;). I decided to step in and find him a cologne which would attract people and not flies. When he first tried it, he loved it. Than at school he kept getting compliments (especially from the young ladies). And to this day, he still wears it.    It is not overwhelming, a warm oriental/spicy smell. Settles in nice and people need to get a little close to smell it.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and good price</li>
    <li> Been buying this cologne for years, great deal!</li>
    <li> Everything was perfect. I recommend.</li>
    <li> By far the best smelling cologne i have ever had</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this stuff.  It&#x27;s very amazing.  I used Gravity for a long time, but more less quit wearing it.  I decided to check out a few colognes while in a store the other day and found I liked the initial smell of Pi and Adidas 1.  I put some on each arm and walked around for about 15 minutes and the Pi only got better.  It is nice and subtle scent that sticks around for a long time.  I highly recommend this stuff.  I wouldn&#x27;t tell anyone else around you though, as you&#x27;ll want to keep this stuff your secret.</li>
    <li> I first saw this aromatic with my friends in a Meijer display case at two in the morning. Seeing as we have a mutual friend, Pai (also known by the French name Cha Bou Pai), I pulled out my phone and ordered it on Amazon. The decision was that simple. The next day, I rethought my decision. Did I really need Pi? No. Nonetheless, my attempts to cancel the order were unsuccessful. And so, here I sit, engulfed in the scents of patchouli and sandalwood. The supposed irrationality of my decision in purchasing Pi is not the only reason that this product is aptly named. The smell, like the mathematical constant, is unending. My attempts to remove the fragrance from my wrists have so far been unsuccessful, and I believe the spray may be permanently embedded in my epidermis. Alas, the fragrance is beginning to grow on me, and I am starting to think that the scent may be appropriate in contexts besides the suggested evening usage. For example, this scent would be perfect for a trip to the library, given its academic aroma. 3.14159.... stars is not an option, so a solid 4 will suffice.</li>
    <li> I had about a quarter of a bottle of Pi by Givenchy for Men at home, which is why I purchased a new bottle from Amazon for when I ran out of my original purchase that I had made in-person from ULTA. Thank goodness I did, because I was able to compare the new bottle from Amazone with the real thing: The designer spry nozzle was busted and a cheap bronze plastic (the real deal is goldtone); the liquid is a light, piss yellow (the real deal is amber colored); the bottle is slightly slimmer, which shaves off an ounce as opposed to the 3.4 oz. original, and has subtle differences in the design elements of the glass since it is a more cheaply-made knock off. Of course, the most important factor is the difference in the frangrances. This fake version smells like Pi &amp;#34;Baby Butt Edition&amp;#34;, with a heavy alcohol and baby powder overlay. Be warned, don&#x27;t buy this product on Amazon. Finally, Amazone will not accept a return shipment of frangrances because they are considered &amp;#34;flammable liquids&amp;#34;, but the company will sure as heck ship them out to paying customers. What a rotten product and rotten double-standard.</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite. I have to say that its not a strong smell yet it is noticeable.</li>
    <li> Have always love this cologne smells just right.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance. It is sweeter but still has a musty smell to it. The women I have dated have enjoy it too.</li>
    <li> good deal. BIG bottle</li>
    <li> Great fragrance at a great price.</li>
    <li> exactly what my husband wanted</li>
    <li> This perfume is what I needed. I like it so much. The only disadvantage is that my father is overusing it. I guess I have to sell it to him.</li>
    <li> My husband and I love this fragrance it is delicious! So many women compliment my husband every time he wears this. It is a chick magnet for sure.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. I gave it to my girlfriend for Valentine&#x27;s Day and she loved it. This is the only perfume she wears.</li>
    <li> The product is not the same as the original.&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, this product is amazing. but my problem is about this seller. If you want to know if this perfume is good or not belief me its very good&lt;br /&gt;----&lt;br /&gt;again, my problem is with  DiscountPerfumes&#x27;s seller&lt;br /&gt;I had bought it from a store before I buy this one form this seller and return the original because the &amp;#34; big &amp;#34; difference in the price.&lt;br /&gt;1- the product glass was broken ( maybe the carrier was the problem ) BUT it is usable&lt;br /&gt;2- the smell isn&#x27;t the same 100%, it is about 60-70 from the original one, maybe water has added or something.&lt;br /&gt;My advice&lt;br /&gt;if you can buy this perfume from another seller, DO</li>
    <li> I love this cologne !</li>
    <li> La fragancia del Pi de givenchy - hombres es encantador..!! soy admirador de este perfume, y he tenidos buenos comentarios de el..!! El Aroma a Vainilla es muy rico.!!</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite fragrance...mine too. Great price... packaging was fantastic and it came on time.</li>
    <li> What I imagine a woman&#x27;s wet dream smells like.</li>
    <li> Very good item however, the 4 star rating is due to after 3 uses, the nozzle clogged and it no longer comes out in a mist. It squirts out in a straight line. I wonder if discounted items like this are in fact discounted because the distributor or manufacturer is aware of this type of problem and simply sells in bulk at a discounted rate. Either way, Cologne is good however the method of delivery now is kind of disappointing.</li>
    <li> Great price!  Can&#x27;t go wrong and save a lot from buying in the Mall</li>
    <li> This is a very good cologne.  I will use it all the time.  smells very nice.  Women love it very much.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s popular for a reason, not specifically my favorite (I think I like nautica voyage better, but they are completely different), but definitely a good mellow scent.</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful! It&#x27;s definitely dominated by vanilla but a tempered vanilla. It&#x27;s sweet smelling, although not so light as to be considered a woman&#x27;s fragrance. In truth, it&#x27;s probably more suitable as unisex scent.</li>
    <li> I was worried about the fakes I&#x27;ve heard about on Amazon but took the chance- This is the real deal and smells the same as I remembered. ONE spray lasts around 5-6 hours for me before I notice the fade. Neutral mellow smell that gets comments like &amp;#34;you smell great&amp;#34; as opposed to &amp;#34;I love your cologne&amp;#34;... It mingles with your natural aroma better and I think smells more organic and natural to people which I prefer.</li>
    <li> My favorite, I have been using it for years.</li>
    <li> nice and clean product</li>
    <li> I bought this stuff solely off what I had read online and I was not disappointed. Just ordered my 2nd bottle.</li>
    <li> smells good, but be careful, you can use too much without knowing it...just a lil shot does it..</li>
    <li> Only cologne I ever buy.</li>
    <li> Hey Amazon, If you are going to sell cologne at least make sure you sell the real thing. I had an old bottle I was trying to replace, and Amazon sold me a lemon. O &#x27; well you liver and you learn. This was not even close to the real thing. Amazon you need to make sure that the products that you sell are legit!</li>
    <li> As one of my husband&#x27;s favorite colognes, I purchased this as a surprise gift.  Overall, it was a satisfactory purchase and product.  There were no shipping or timing issues.  The product arrived on time and in one piece.</li>
    <li> Loving it, very good quality and original.</li>
    <li> Pi by Givenchy is my boyfriends favorite cologne so he loved it ..and I love it too its not to strong a nice smell relaxed smell to go out or for ever day wear !! I recommend it for men it smells great</li>
    <li> Soooo great ❤️❤️&lt;br /&gt;Like it too much</li>
    <li> I have been using Pi by Givenchy for going on 7 years now as my go to cologne / aftershave. It has a nice subtle vanilla scent that makes me feel at ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Long lasting&lt;br /&gt;Good manly scent&lt;br /&gt;Not an overpowering scent but strong enough to be noticed&lt;br /&gt;Bottle is stylish&lt;br /&gt;Sprayer holds up at least for 3 years (how long I had my longest bottle)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;None I can find&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I find Pi to be the best all around cologne on the market and have been happy with it for years. If you haven&#x27;t yet you should try it.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite colognes.</li>
    <li> I have loved this scent for years... This scent is one of the best on the market.  It is one of my top 2 favorites</li>
    <li> If you like cinnamon buns, then this cologne is for you. I remember it having a woody pine and slightly vanilla scent when I smelled it as a kid, so I decided to buy it online without sampling again. My girlfriend hates it. I have received no complements from girls about it, whereas with Carolina Harrera 212 [[ASIN:B001CT079C Carolina Herrera 212 By Carolina Herrera For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.4-Ounces]] I was getting comments left and right. This stuff smells goofy and not very professional. I just think that it is forgettable and has too light of a scent. I am now dreading it and trying to use it as quickly as possible to buy a scent that is more youthful and sexy. I am 26, by the way, and I am trying to impress young and sexy ladies, unlike other people on here that may be middle aged and don&#x27;t care as much. May sound superficial but this is a huge difference in taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moral of the story: ALWAYS get a sample from a store before you decide to buy online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Ken Flemming&lt;br /&gt;Author, How to Get a Job in Video Games</li>
    <li> Brand new sealed in box and not a faux cologne in the packaging. A++++++</li>
    <li> Excellent scent. My wife won&#x27;t let me wear anything else. Best place to order it.</li>
    <li> Love Pi especially at a very good price.</li>
    <li> Nice clean scent without that musky smell. Hope they never discontinue it. People always ask the name of this when my husband wears it.</li>
    <li> This is not the real thing. I am not sure why amazon is selling this!!!! you cannot even return a $50 product....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i thought that since this has been some time without bad reviews i would risk it but save your money and buy the real thing at the store!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i dont even know what to do with it since its so poor quality and came with a broke lid as well...</li>
    <li> The smell of this product is amazing. I wear it so much that people are starting to associate me with the smell. I must say this was an excellent job of receiving my cologne. The box was wrapped in bubble wrap which provided excellent protection to my cologne and i appreciate that. I will be doing a lot more business with you guys. I love the length of the smell as well. Provides you with a scent that lasts all day even when you think its gone some one else can smell it on you.</li>
    <li> This is a very fresh, yet spicy fragrance.  I think there are vanilla and cinnamon notes to it.  I&#x27;ve reviewed this before and still think it makes my husband smell like a giant french toast log.  Yummy!!</li>
