      <li>Nice, easy to use and worked perfectly.</li>
      <li>Great rods that come with a cute carrying case.  </li>
      <li>This is a great buy because when you go into the beauty store one pack of 6 is 3 or more dollars and if you have alot of hair like myself once you purchase all you need</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Does not hold well... i had to go buy new ones from cvs and they worked perfectly</li>
    <li> Works really well ~ not as comfy to sleep on as rolling in paper towels, but the end result is great</li>
    <li> It was just what I needed.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used them yet but they are exactly what I wanted.  Will followup when I do.</li>
    <li> This would have been perfect if the purple and grey ones bended.. Other than that they worked just fine. For the price I can&#x27;t really complain and i also don&#x27;t have long enough hair to use the bigger ones but. I would still recommend this.</li>
    <li> Awesome!  They arrived on time and did not have a bad smell or missing pieces as others experienced.  Great price and beautiful curls.</li>
    <li> My hair is going through some texture changes. Not to mention I&#x27;m trying to easy up on the heat for healthy hair. This allows me to do some fun easy styles without having to use any heat on my hair. I Love this set!</li>
    <li> Okay this is a horrible buy!!  The purple and the gray rods DO NOT BEND AT ALL!!!! I was so furious when I did my hair the night before going to work and I couldn&#x27;t put any curls in it using this product. I was lucky enough to have purchased a pack of longer purple rods from the Beauty supply store only because I saw the ones in the pack were short. The other samller rods work fine for those who like tiny curls but if you&#x27;re looking for the Kimmy K waves then this IS NOT what you want to spend your money on. This is not worth the money you spend on it. I read the other review just now and the Ms. Melissa had the same problem with this item. I swear I&#x27;m reading customers comments for now on cause if I would have seen hers I would have just paid the money and got them at Sallys. 1 Good thing is I just got off the phone with Amazon and they have already refunded me my money and sent me a packing slip to send this wack blankety blank product back. Although the seller is a selling a BUNCH OF CRAP Amazon is the best at resolving a problem!!!! Thanks Amazon!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHO NEEDS FLEXI RODS THAT DON&#x27;T FLEX!!!!</li>
    <li> The purple ans the gray did not bend at all! Period! Luckily I had some purples that I purchased from a beauty supply store when I was on leave in the states. The orange ones are ok at bending then the rest of the little one are pretty good too. But I normally dont want little curls. I like the big ones! I was so upset. I knew I should have just order the Annies...</li>
    <li> I love these flexi rods</li>
    <li> Work wonderfully, strong and flexible many nice sizes to choose from.</li>
    <li> Excellent so happy 😌 I get this</li>
    <li> I Youtubed tutorials before buying this and was skeptical because of my hair type (thick and blonde). However, I found a way to make them work as intended. Instead of bending them, I use small clips on the end of my hair to keep my hair from unraveling. I sleep on them although they are not the most comfortable. I recommend to anyone trying to go heatless like myself! :)</li>
    <li> All the rollers bend with no problem on my natural hair. Wish i had bigger ones instead of skinny ones.</li>
    <li> they&#x27;re nice and as described, but way too time consuming and there&#x27;s no way you could sleep in the things.  i don&#x27;t know what i expected.  magic curlers maybe?  these aren&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> I just received my flexi rods today. I was a little hesitant about ordering prior to reading the reviews. I checked each packet of the flexi rods, all bend accurately. I sampled a small section of my hair with the rods, it gives a nice firm hold. I like that the flexi rods are softly cushioned.</li>
    <li> I totally love these flex rods, they are awesome!!!!!!!!!!! these are the good stuff&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62; no curling iron for me again....</li>
    <li> These are the bomb and are pretty easy to use. My hair turned out great I just love them. Plus they are not as heavy on your head as the plastic per rollers.</li>
    <li> Please pay attention to the &amp;#34;SIZE&amp;#34; of the rods....some Very small. So good for tight curls or short hair. I have used the rods twice since receiving 7/29 and they seems like I may &amp;#34;not&amp;#34; get long term use out of them. Keep you posted! Also, I had to wipe each rod with a damp cloth, they were covered in a white dusting. No clue what it was, so I cleaned each which was time consuming for 60 rods. :(</li>
    <li> I love this alternative for curl</li>
    <li> I purchased these rods right before christmas and I was so excited once I got them.  I rodded my hair, wrapped my hair in a scarf and slept on the rollers with no problem.  When I woke up I had some wonderful curls.  My curls lasted for over three days and the only reason im sure they didn&#x27;t last longer is because I had to wash them out.  I didn&#x27;t have to use a bunch of hair spray or any other products for that matter and I ended up with soft, bouncy curls.  LOOVVVEEEE IIIIITTTTT.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once on natural hair, and it didn&#x27;t turn out that great.  Maybe for those who have straight or thin hair, this product would be great. I also air dried my hair.  Perhaps a hair dryer would have given me better results. I will try it again with a hair and see what happens.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews i was hesitant about some of the rods not bending, especially since i would be using the big ones. I havent used them yet, but when i got them i made sure they all worked. They do. Now im planning on purchasing a 2nd set</li>
    <li> So far so good with these..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to buy these to eliminate having to use a flat/curling iron everyday. I am trying to grow healthy hair without using much heat.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with the results I am getting so far using these. I&#x27;ve been using these every other night as I at times would like the curls to drop a bit. So far so good indeed!!</li>
    <li> My hair looks great, I even use it in my kid&#x27;s hair! I loved it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very, very much😃</li>
    <li> This came in brand new. It was awesome i love it. I use it a lot for when I&#x27;m about to got to bed. The next day i wake up with my hair wavy without using the wand. Thank you for this great deal.</li>
    <li> too heavy for fine hair</li>
    <li> ok could have a little more support when twisted</li>
    <li> I love them. I have really long hair and it takes too long to curl in the mornings. I just put these in at night and they work great. I have used all of the different sets and they all work fine</li>
    <li> I love this rod set to take the place of plastic or foam hair rollers. It will not rip out your hair or get tangle in a mess. I can sleep in them without it bunching and being uncomfortable. There are different size rods and you can make different hair styles. because they are color coated you know what size rods are in the pack.</li>
    <li> These flexi rods work well and I had no issues with them not bending. It&#x27;s a good deal and they are good quality rods.</li>
    <li> I was very leary about buying these rods because of my last experience. But I&#x27;m glad I did, not only are they a great price but they work AWESOME. I love how they come in all different sizes.</li>
    <li> It works. I just feel that I will need to purchase more of the smaller sizes but over all it works for me.</li>
    <li> These are so versatile. I use them on the ends of my twists and for wet sets on my natural hair. These are worth the money.</li>
    <li> The bigger rollers do not bend, but the rest of them work great. next time i will only buy the smaller ones.</li>
    <li> Fun and easy to use.  I am trying out each size for the curl-result, and the variety is fun.  I have&lt;br /&gt;shoulder- length, fine hair with some natural curl.  I get the same results with much less effort&lt;br /&gt;as a curling wand, which I use rarely because I hate putting my hair through the process.&lt;br /&gt;A great value, and the storage bag is convenient.</li>
    <li> purple don&#x27;t work, hasn&#x27;t for a few months now, but every other color works. love these for easy curls with no heat</li>
    <li> I haven’t  used the rod set yet. I checked some of the rods though and they bend easily so they should give the hair a good curl. I like them because each size is a different color that makes it easier to distinguish. I will update this review once I have used the rods on my hair.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get these I used them right away! Well I was a little worried about previous reviews saying the purple and orange rods don&#x27;t bend but they did I rolled my head with the larger rods and it was great except the gray rods smelled like mildew so I had soak them first but they worked great and it was a good deal had to give 4 stars because of the smell made me feel like they were sitting in musty basement for awhile.</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length hair, I purchased some other brand kind from Walmart, and didn&#x27;t really care for them.  This set though, I really love.  My hair has different lengths so I really appreciate the fact, there is so many different sizes.  I was a bit apprehensive about some of the reviews due to the fact some said some colors didn&#x27;t bend, and had a smell to them.  Mine all bend very well,and have no smell to them at all.  If your hair is hard to curl, these are great!  I haven&#x27;t left them in over night, but sometimes when im in a hurry, I take a spray bottle, lightly mist my hair, and leave in for about 20 min.  I have the nicest curl.  Give the Rods a try, the price is right for so many rods.  I nearly gave this much money for far less from Walmart, and am not happy with the walmart ones.</li>
    <li> Im happy with  the end wraps.  They arrived sooner than I expected. I will definitely order them again</li>
    <li> I love these flexi-rods!!! They are the right amount of each size and they produce great curls!! his was an excellent buy for under $20!!</li>
    <li> PROS&lt;br /&gt;-Carrying case&lt;br /&gt;-Various Sizes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;-As previously mentioned, the purple and grey rollers don&#x27;t hold when you bend, at all. Pretty much a waste of space. (NOTE: I ended up making the grey rollers hold a bend but bending them all&lt;br /&gt;-Also, both the grey and purple rods come 12 each, while the other colors are only 6 (making basically a quarter of this product useless)&lt;br /&gt;-All the other colors work great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you could pick the colors you want, this would be 5 stars.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t twist easily.</li>
    <li> The arrived when expected/ amazon prime&lt;br /&gt;I read reviews that the smaller ones didn&#x27;t bend but all of mine work just fine. I only needed the large ones but found that it was still cheaper to buy the set and loved that the set came with a carrying case. I love how easy these are to use and it takes very little time to roll the hair with these rollers.No more worries of missing clips, pins, clasps etc</li>
    <li> Junk omg...so hard to make them stay in hair and they look so ridiculous. Smell pretty weird too. Pretty bad purchase.</li>
    <li> I really love these flex rods it was my first time trying them I will be ordering more really soon</li>
    <li> My 10-year old daughter wanted some way to curl her wavy hair.  She asked for rollers, but I have nightmares about sleeping in those things - even the soft ones!  I saw these and thought they looked comfortable.  She loves them.  They are easy to use, both putting in and taking out.  And with the multiples sizes, she can get the look she wants.  Nice to have a soft-sided holder too to keep them all together.</li>
    <li> I was told how great this would be for tight curls. Well, I did not get the curls that I wanted or a curl at all. waste</li>
    <li> I rate this product a 5  it shipped fast and it was packaged very nicely I love the different sizes it worked great on my hair I feel it was a very good deal and I am a happy customer</li>
    <li> Unfortunately the grey and purple rods do not completely bend making it impossible to securely hold your curls and rods in place, the rods will just slide off your hair. Unlike the other reviews, I did not have smelly ones....lol</li>
    <li> I do not like thes roller. They donot stay on the hair.</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore this rod set!! It works wonders for my hair and are super easy to use! I would recommend to all.</li>
    <li> Nice, easy to use and worked perfectly. Good price</li>
    <li> Came neatly packaged. Like the carrying bag it comes in. All the rods bend.  Get nice curls/waves with these</li>
    <li> I LOOOOVE my flexi rods. At first I was worried that they would be too short for my long thick hair but they are perfect! I also like the different sizes. So you have big , medium,  or small curls. Once again I have to say Amazon ROCKS!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have never used flex rods before. Saw a utube video and decided to give it a try. Work great!</li>
    <li> We have not used these yet, but we are very excited to use them.  My daughter and I have gone natural and can not wait until summer to try new styles.</li>
    <li> They were useful. I think that they are a little expensive. I have had them for a little over three weeks now. Beautiful curls each time. Other than price, nothing wrong with them at all!</li>
    <li> Nice and comfortable. take a little practice to get use to but once you get going they are much better than the standard curlers. Love the convenient container so you don&#x27;t have to trouble yourself too much with storage.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and just as described. The rods bends and straightens easily. Soft enough to sleep on. My daughter slept with it in her hair. She didn&#x27;t complain and they did not fall out. She woke up with nice soft curly hair.</li>
    <li> I LOVE These rollers. Very gentle in my tender scalp and curl and body on my locks for days! Yay!!!</li>
    <li> Firstly I will say these rods had No funny smell and then bend just perfectly despite what some people have reported they are great! However if you have medium length (shoulder) and less you will need to purchase more of the smaller rods I needed more blue was perfect my for current hair length.. if you have a lot of hair! Easily done of course, this set has a lot of BIG rods for people who have long hair for nice curls, that is my only warning to you. Love them and my curls come out flawless! I HIGHLY recommend!</li>
    <li> I like this set because it&#x27;s fun, easy, and fast! I love it! And it&#x27;s enough for my hair as well!</li>
    <li> Just got these in the mail. The first think I did was to check and see if the purple and grey rods would bend, and they did!!! only reason I&#x27;m giving them 4 stars instead of 5 is because I havent used them yet.</li>
    <li> Love them&lt;br /&gt;shipping was great</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good quality and it curls my hair quite nicely. I used the ones all the way at the bottom and they were great in the drying and even for overnight use. I recommend this pack to anyone. I also like how it comes with all different sizes</li>
    <li> I like these rods. They all bend, so I didn&#x27;t have the issues that some other buyers had with their curl rods being inflexible. The only issue I had is that my hair takes *forever* to dry in these, so I&#x27;m not really sure that I&#x27;ll be using them, but the curl pattern is beautiful. I have naturally curly hair, but it&#x27;s nice to change up the texture and look every now and then, and this is a heatless way to do it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t trying them but they doesn&#x27;t look good product.</li>
    <li> Hard to keep in the hair after curling it!!</li>
    <li> Arrived as expected! Awesome price and fast shipping. Thank you!</li>
    <li> All of then work great, except the purple an grey ones, but the others work great, theres enough of them for my whole head to make small to medium size curls. A lot better then using heat or sleeping with huge rollers.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my girlfriend to curl her hair.  The value of this package was the best compared to the other packages.  You get a lot of these for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Flexible and held well in my hair. More than plenty to use. Only suggestion is that if you have long thick hair try using like a curling hair product with it when putting it in or extra hold hairspray. Lasted 2 hrs for me (with no product) after having curlers in for 4 hrs. Id still recommend this product to someone who wants heat less curls :)</li>
    <li> They are great! Made my hair look wonderful.</li>
    <li> good material but Betty hard to bend and make stay</li>
    <li> I was initially frightened by the reviews I read on this product but I think some batches are defective. I love this rubber rods  and they worked perfectly. So happy for this purchase</li>
    <li> The description says that there are 60 rods in the package. However, the specifications indicate that there are 6 rods of each color. There are only 7 colors shown in the picture. Which means 56 rods. What&#x27;s with the discrepancy? I don&#x27;t like that at all.</li>
    <li> I really love this. It worked perfectly on my natural hair. I am black and my hair is natural has to be done and this product is perfect. If you want to see how i use the product watch my youtube video and subscribe, if you have any question ask me on the comment section [...]</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I think the reviewers who gave these a thumbs up are women who use mostly the orange and smaller rods, which work fine, because like others who use the grey and purple ones, I find them impossible to use.  In my kit the grey ones are the largest ones, not the purple, but the purple size was exactly what I needed now and I had to use rubber bands to hold them in the bended form to make curls. Without the rubber bands they just unwind immediately and are useless.  With my hair being the length it is right now orange is probably good for real curls but I need the purple for nice soft wavy curls and will eventually need the grey ones because I&#x27;m letting my hair grow even longer.  If you think you&#x27;ll need the purple or grey rods just avoid this product altogether.</li>
    <li> They produce beautiful curls and are still usable even after my daughters began trying to play with them.</li>
    <li> The rods bends, great variety of sizes n colors. Durability n style at a great price.  So glad I purchased.</li>
    <li> Im so in love with this product, came quickly, and stores great. The curls form nicely and i loved that i got a nice amount of all the different sizes instead of buying them individualy, great pricing, and a great find</li>
    <li> The flexi rods work fine and are easy to use. In the set there are 10 packets of 6 flexi rods each one. There are 12 purple, 12 gray, 12 orange, 6 blue, 6 red, 6 yellow and 6 green.  All of them come inside the plastic vanity case so it works as storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of them bend ok and after using them return to their position if stretched. The material is soft enough as to sleep with them from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As there are 60 rods, it is possible to share with someone else. I prefer the big ones and I don&#x27;t need all of them to do my hair (all the purples, grays and oranges).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest drawback is the strong smell to plastic and the fact that the odor can stick to the hair if it is wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, it is a good set for 23.55$ (that&#x27;s what I paid) but I would not pay more for them and I would think twice before buying if I were very sensitive to odors.</li>
    <li> Use these slot love the way the curl my natural hair</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered and for a great price... As a hairstylist I&#x27;m happy with this purchase</li>
    <li> they work within an hour awesome i love these</li>
    <li> love using these curlers, my hair is medium texture and thickness, and is relaxed.  I usually use a setting lotion with my hair slightly to fully damp, and leave the curlers in overnight.  they also are not too uncomfortable to sleep in, and they all bended just fine.  I love the fact that I can skip the curling iron and any heat whatsoever and my hair looks fabulous!</li>
    <li> I have not been able to figure out how to use this item. They are too long and bulky. They are useless.</li>
    <li> I love all the different sizes. I am 1- year newly natural and purchased this set for when my hair continue to grow and I get length. The purple and gray rods are the largest so they don&#x27;t bend as easily or more flexible as the smaller rod do--but they DO bend. Worth the money cost me $21 (I waited until the price went down again from $35) because if bought the packages individually it would have been expensive.</li>
    <li> These rods work really well for the price. All my rods bend and work just fine. The only thing is the smell but all flexi rods have this smell so it&#x27;s not unusual after a couple of uses the smell will get faint. Overall for the price and the amount of rods its a steal.</li>
    <li> Easiest no heat hair curling I&#x27;ve ever done. The gray rods specifically work really well in my hair and give it a more consistent wavy look than just letting it do it&#x27;s own thing. Easy to sleep in, comfortable, does not pull my hair, and despite other reviewers stating that they don&#x27;t bend.... I&#x27;ve had no problem.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve recommended these to several people already because a lot of people I know hate having to heat style their hair.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy I purchased these!</li>
    <li> I love them. Came on time.</li>
    <li> My hair is natural..I wanted these rolls but they are yo expensive to buy separately in the store. These rollers  are good and soft.</li>
    <li> Unknown, it is a xmas gift.</li>
    <li> They seem to work for me and create beautiful curls. They aren&#x27;t too hard so it doesn&#x27;t bother me top sleep in them. Love them.</li>
    <li> Great price....bought two packs. Really wanted just the medium sized rods but it was way more cost efficient to get the entire 60 :)</li>
    <li> I love these! I am mixed race and my hair is pretty straight naturally with some small curls. I use these to get much more uniform and larger curls. ALL of mine bend fine perfectly and my dreams of looking like a caramel Shirley Temple have been realized LOL.</li>
    <li> Did what they were suppose too.</li>
    <li> It came just in  time , i had all 60 pieces&lt;br /&gt;I gave this 4 stars because they was dirty i had to wash them all before use, there was mud every where. theses rods gave me good waves/curls. i would buy again : )</li>
    <li> i bought it for my girlfriend who has no problem at all and has asked that I give it a five star rating!  since I&#x27;m not the one using it, I think it would be fair to go along with her request.</li>
    <li> I think you need longer hair to use these, but there&#x27;s plenty in this pouch. I&#x27;ll probably try them again next year when my hair is a little bit longer.</li>
    <li> The reason why I gave it 2 stars is because these things smell to high heaven. They smelt like an old peoples home.&lt;br /&gt;I tried washing them to get rid of the smell, but the smell won&#x27;t go away and the smell gets in my hair. It&#x27;s unbearable and I&#x27;m very angry about how awful it smells. Not to mention, the bag the flexi rods came in had 2 tares in it. Other than that the rods work perfectly and leave very nice curls.</li>
    <li> I was going to purchase tone pack from Target which only consisted of 15 rods for $15.  I searched and found these on Amazon for an incredible price.  Loving it!</li>
    <li> I love the rubber rods because they&#x27;re of very good quality and work very well. I&#x27;ve used them on my 4a natural hair several times and they give superb results. I also love that it comes in different sizes so that i can make curls of different sizes or just curl a section of hair in the size that i want it to be.</li>
    <li> Very good flex rollers. These work pretty much as they are described. I do wish they actually bent a little better, but for the most part, I feel they work 90% perfectly. Awesome carrying case and huge selection of sizes. I feel this is a great investment. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a great set. I am pleased with my purchase. Good quality. You can use different rods and make your style different every day.</li>
    <li> i like it a lot is very easy to do and the hair last ..... beautiful natural curls.. I recomemded</li>
    <li> I got my rod set on time, and had no problem with any them bending. They worked perfectly, I can&#x27;t keep my daughter from them, I will  have to order her some also.</li>
    <li> This is a great buy because when you go into the beauty store one pack of 6 is 3 or more dollars and if you have alot of hair like myself once you purchase all you need then you are going to spend tons of money . I love them because it is a variety of sizes and it comes with a little carrying case</li>
    <li> Love it it&#x27;s so easy I just roll and sleep and wake up to great curls my hair is naturally curly but these rods I don&#x27;t have to put any harsh chemicals in my hair 👍👍</li>
    <li> They all bend perfect. They made beautiful curls. I love them!!!</li>
    <li> I read the negative reviews and 1) ALL my rods bend 2) the rods had no foul smell or strange odor &amp; 3) ALL the rods were clean. I&#x27;m still learning how to use the rods but so far, I really like them. My hair is short and I need more of the small rods, so I might order another pack. And the zipper carrying case is very useful. No complaints!!  :-)</li>
    <li> Excellent price and I like the bag that came with the rods so I can keep them together</li>
    <li> Easy to use, comfortable to sleep with &amp; beautiful curls every time.</li>
    <li> Love the quick shipment. And the fact I was able to get all these different prices at a great deal compared to competitors.</li>
    <li> Love this every size and super fast shipping</li>
    <li> This item shipped quickly to my APO in Japan, and all of the rods bend and work how they&#x27;re suppose too. I think the people who had issues with the gray and purple not bending just got a bad batch.</li>
    <li> These rods give me a chance too change my look. I wear them to bed. I use end wraps to prevent hair breakage. Best purchase I made all year!</li>
    <li> It comes with 1 set of the 4 smaller sizes and two sets of the orange, grey, and purple; so if you wanted very tiny curls, this is not for you. I tested all the rods and they all bend. This is the best price that I&#x27;ve seen for them ($40 for 60 was the lowest before this) and they seem to be very good quality material.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so over joyed with this purchases works on my hair as well as weaves great price fast shipping love his buy.</li>
    <li> I got these and they are wonderful. They were just like the description. Great buy for the money. Worked great for me.</li>
    <li> Cheap isn&#x27;t always the way to go. The quality isn&#x27;t terrible but it isn&#x27;t superb either. I would recommend these for people just wanting to test them out. Another concern I had was that my package was delivered with no invoice which made me question of legit this company is.</li>
    <li> All my rods work fine, they all bend the way they should. Got great results while using them!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome deal.  I have only tested the bent and they are just as good as any others.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used my rods yet, but I did test a few od them and they worked just perfectly.</li>
    <li> Better than I expected at a low price.</li>
    <li> Great product. All of the sizes are PERFECT! Would def buy again!</li>
    <li> These were great!  Other reviewers mentioned that they don&#x27;t bend properly but they all bent perfectly in my daughters hair.  She found a way to sleep in them and was very happy with her curls the next morning.  I love this product!  It even has enough rollers to cover my whole head and I have very thick hair.  The case is perfect.  It helps keep track of all of the rods.</li>
    <li> These are really nice!  The only downside is that you are given so little of the smaller rods but it is still a good deal.</li>
    <li> ABLE TO USE THEM ON NATURAL AND RELAXED HAIR (IM NATURAL BUT CLIENT IS NOT)  MIGHT HAVE TO BUY MORE JUST TO HAVE ON HAND.</li>
    <li> Great rods that come with a cute carrying case.  Easy way to style my natural hair without heat damage.  Easy to store too!</li>
    <li> Work great for curly or straight hair.</li>
    <li> The rods work very well.  I tried them last nite and they work great. I was even able to sleep in them.</li>
