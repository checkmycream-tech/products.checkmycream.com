      <li>Thank you Kasny Recon for developing such a wonderful product.</li>
      <li>I plan on trying many more of your products.</li>
      <li>You will LOVE it.</li>
      <li>Keeps my skin hydrated all day. :)</li>
      <li>This product is okay</li>
      <li>It goes on nice and smooth, not oily at all.  </li>
      <li>but still is a good product if you are willing to pay the price</li>
      <li>My skin is very sensitive and this was great with no reaction at all.  </li>
      <li>my face burns and turns very bright red.</li>
      <li>Great natural moisturizer.</li>
      <li>All natural and a great price.</li>
      <li>It absorbs right into my skin, non greasy, and nice smell.</li>
      <li>and I love how this made my skin smooth and pimple free.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s to strong</li>
      <li>I love this one so far, as it makes my skin feel very healthy.</li>
      <li>Not to mention is smells fantastic.  </li>
      <li>I have only used it on my face, but bet it would be great on any area like elbows, knees and hands!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>My skin being fair and extremely sensitive had problems with every thing.  </li>
      <li>I know natural shea butter is a good product for the skin.</li>
      <li>have not used yet, tried it on the back of my hand and it seems to feel very nice.</li>
      <li>If you have normal to oily skin, you&#x27;re better off looking for a more lightweight moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>This is worth the money!</li>
      <li>Amazing natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>I skipped putting it on my hands for one day, and now they are cracking and sore, so obviously it was doing a good job before and is helping them to heal now.  </li>
      <li>Whenever I put my make up on over top of it, the make up did not spread around well and it appeared as if I was putting too much</li>
      <li>I am in my late 50s and this is the best cream I have ever purchased.</li>
      <li>I need to use more moistuizer on dry areas but this cream is very good overall.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s SO moisturizing and absorbs into skin so quickly.</li>
      <li>I have paid many times more for a similar amount that just didn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The container says it \\&quot;contains the purest Chadian Shea butter available, perfectly blended with other precious natural extracts to restore youthful glow, rejuvenate at the cellular level, and maintain moisture; all with a natural SPF.  </li>
      <li>It makes my skin feel really soft and healthy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s immediately absorbed and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all.  </li>
      <li>Ever since, I&#x27;ve looked for that ingredient when buying anything that goes on my face but rarely find it</li>
      <li>so it is economical too.</li>
      <li>The scent of this cream is distinct, but I like it.</li>
      <li>This is a great product for dry, sensitive skin!  </li>
      <li>and right before I apply my makeup.  </li>
      <li>So I was happy to find this product online listing shea butter as the primary ingredient (second only to water) and happier still to get three times as much for $12.  </li>
      <li>so don&#x27;t know about how the product work yet, but the company took my review and sent me another jar that was new and in secure container.  </li>
      <li>It adsorbs easily and makes my skin feel soft.  great&amp;#60;</li>
      <li>it absorbs well and would probably be good for normal to slightly dry skin.</li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t apply very smoothly at all, you have to rub it into your skin or you just get white smear marks.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many kinds of creams and finally I hit the jackpot.</li>
      <li>With this product, all that redness is gone if I&#x27;m consistent in using this product.  </li>
      <li>The actual cream seems OK.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many facial moisturizers, looking for a product to help w/my dry-red patches.  </li>
      <li>I find the shea and other organic ingredients soothing and refreshing, and the natural ingredients seem to hydrate the skin and not just sit on top.</li>
      <li>I have been using it for several months and have noticed a big differance in that the lines have softened on my face and new ones have not appeared because of this great moisurizer.</li>
      <li>Thanks for putting the customer first.</li>
      <li>maybe that helps it sink in, if you have dry skin, you would probably love it like I do.</li>
      <li>But this is largely because of the packaging.</li>
      <li>will certainly buy it again when I get to the bottom of the jar.</li>
      <li>I love the ingredients used in this face cream, very natural and simple.</li>
      <li>After years of searching for a facial moisturizer, I finally found the one to LOVE!...</li>
      <li>I highly recommend!</li>
      <li>My current regimen follows a very close WTG, XTG, and sometimes ATG shave (check the Badger and Blade forum if you need that deciphered) with a Feather SS using their Professional single-edge blade (that I love):</li>
      <li>Our Facial Revitalizing Cream is free of PEG, paraben, carboner, alcohol mineral oil and silicones.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but didn&#x27;t do much to heal my skin so much as amend the appearance of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>My skin absorbs it instantly and is silky smooth.  </li>
      <li>He loves this stuff, as much as I do.</li>
      <li>Needs to be worked into the skin as the consistency is very creamy.  </li>
      <li>I love how it&#x27;s almost as thick as Burt&#x27;s Bees carrot facial cream when you first touch it, but when you spread it out on your face this stuff is simply refreshing and moisturizing.</li>
      <li>Several days ago I got a new jar in the mail that was secure and was new.  </li>
      <li>The ingredients are all natural and very high quality.  </li>
      <li>Not too greasy or heavy, and quickly absorbed; actually requires more than one application.</li>
      <li>If this is the normal state for this product to be sold, I would not recommend it.</li>
      <li>He has very sensitive skin and when he is in the sun, as he is a lot, his skin gets very inflamed, I like that it has a natural spf in it.  </li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin that&#x27;s prone to rashes and breakouts.  </li>
      <li>The moisturizer itself is pretty much standard.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have a lot of problems with chemicals, but at the same time my skin is now so dry and itchy! After my shower, I put a dab of this on my palm, then a pump of my oatmeal moisturizer, mix it together, then put it on my face, arms and shoulders; It is wonderfully creamy, and has a very mild pleasant fragrance.  I also can&#x27;t tolerate anything that leaves a greasy residue on my skin or holds in the heat (which a lot of oils do!) This melts right into my skin and feels like I don&#x27;t have anything on my face; It moisturizes well, however since we have lately had unseasonably cold weather, I need to slather it on more than usual, whereas before I was washing/moisturizing my face 1x a day, after my shower, I am now applying throughout the day just before applying Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm. I skipped putting it on my hands for one day, and now they are cracking and sore, so obviously it was doing a good job before and is helping them to heal now.  I sure won&#x27;t skip it again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container says it \\&quot;contains the purest Chadian Shea butter available, perfectly blended with other precious natural extracts to restore youthful glow, rejuvenate at the cellular level, and maintain moisture; all with a natural SPF.  Our Facial Revitalizing Cream is free of PEG, paraben, carboner, alcohol mineral oil and silicones.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Acqua (water), Butyrospermum parkii (shea butter), Vegetable glycerin, Prunus ameniaca (apricot kernal oil), Glyceryl stearate citrate (plant derived), Glyceryl stearate (plant derived), Glyceryl stearate SE(plant derived), Theobroma nucifera (cocoa butter), Mangifera indica (mango butter), xanthane gum, Natural frangrances (essential oils blend), Tocopherol (Vitamin E Oil), Phenoxyethonol, Chlophenesin, Capryly glycol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eco-citizen - No Testing on animals - Fair - Made in USA\\&quot;  I&#x27;m not sure Fair what, since it just says Fair.</li>
    <li> The moisturizer itself is pretty much standard. Not too greasy or heavy, and quickly absorbed; actually requires more than one application. However, it came with absolutely ZERO anti-tamper/safety/freshness seals, the cream was all plastered to the lid, and it took a gigantic leap of faith to actually put my fingers into the cream and use it. For all I know, it could have been used by someone else before it got to my house. If this is the normal state for this product to be sold, I would not recommend it. But this is largely because of the packaging. Packaging doesn&#x27;t seem safe, and I won&#x27;t order again. The actual cream seems OK.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for dry, sensitive skin!  I&#x27;ve tried many facial moisturizers, looking for a product to help w/my dry-red patches.  This works!  It&#x27;s creamy &amp; soothing and calms my skin.  This is lovely for rich nighttime treatment; Smells good too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IN ADDITION:  great price!!!</li>
    <li> Honestly, I couldn&#x27;t believe that no one else has reviewed this cream. I got it several weeks ago. Bought it to soothe my very dry skin. Have used it every morning and night since. It is great stuff! It is creamy and goes on so silky you won&#x27;t believe it. I first thought it wouldn&#x27;t sink into my skin over my other lotions. and creams I use, but it did, and made my skin so moisturized! I do exfoliate so maybe that helps it sink in, if you have dry skin, you would probably love it like I do. I have only used it on my face, but bet it would be great on any area like elbows, knees and hands!&lt;br /&gt;I will certainly buy it again when I get to the bottom of the jar. A little goes a very long way so it is economical too. can&#x27;t beat that in this day and age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I can&#x27;t believe it has been almost two years since I ordered this cream. My hubby tried it a few weeks after I got it. He has very sensitive skin and when he is in the sun, as he is a lot, his skin gets very inflamed, I like that it has a natural spf in it.  He loves this stuff, as much as I do. He uses it morning and night, I use it in the daytime when my skin feels very dry and at night on my face and elbows.&lt;br /&gt;I do see the package is changed, but hopefully the ingredients will be the same as when we got it two years ago.  We are reordering it today, May 2012, because it is now almost all gone. We can&#x27;t believe how long it has lasted, like I said before a small amount goes a long way, just pat it into the skin, so it is well worth the price. His skin and mine drink it in. We hope this company keeps making it. Wish it came in a larger size.&lt;br /&gt;Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I love how it&#x27;s almost as thick as Burt&#x27;s Bees carrot facial cream when you first touch it, but when you spread it out on your face this stuff is simply refreshing and moisturizing. I appreciate the scent as well. Keeps my skin hydrated all day. :)</li>
    <li> My skin is very sensitive and this was great with no reaction at all.  I live in a dry climate and have very dry skin.  This cream does a very good job with moisturizing.  Has a pleasant scent. Needs to be worked into the skin as the consistency is very creamy.  I need to use more moistuizer on dry areas but this cream is very good overall.  All natural and a great price. Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Got this product and was not happy, I did a neg. review because the product I got was not sealed and I would not use it.  Several days ago I got a new jar in the mail that was secure and was new.  I have not use it yet so don&#x27;t know about how the product work yet, but the company took my review and sent me another jar that was new and in secure container.  I have to give this company a 5 star for doing this.  Thanks for putting the customer first.</li>
    <li> Have not used it enough to have a recommendation.  It is very rich and a little heavy for a face moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Other reviewers have found this to be too thick; it&#x27;s similar to an old-fashioned &amp;#34;cold cream,&amp;#34; like Noxema or Ponds that my mom used to use on her face (before she switched to Oil of Olay). So, it is a bit thick relative to some of the lighter moisturizers, but I use this post-shave on just the beard portion of my face which dries out at the slightest provocation otherwise, especially when the weather gets cold. My current regimen follows a very close WTG, XTG, and sometimes ATG shave (check the Badger and Blade forum if you need that deciphered) with a Feather SS using their Professional single-edge blade (that I love): I use the Weleda men&#x27;s facial moisturizer on my whole face--a tiny amount--and then layer this heavier cream over my beard area. No more problems with dry spots. I find the shea and other organic ingredients soothing and refreshing, and the natural ingredients seem to hydrate the skin and not just sit on top.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews for this I took a gamble to try it and I was disappointed. It has a slight smell I don&#x27;t care for and it doesn&#x27;t apply very smoothly at all, you have to rub it into your skin or you just get white smear marks. It seems to have a consistency like buttercream, as in that it is hard when cold, making it really hard to use right now because it&#x27;s winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I did like about it was that is doesn&#x27;t hurt when it&#x27;s applied. I have very dry skin, so when I apply normal mosturizers (even sensitive skin ones) my face burns and turns very bright red. This cream didn&#x27;t hurt on application and didn&#x27;t wear out either, so my skin did not start flaking later on in the day either. However, when I took a shower my skin returns to its dry state, so I sort of feel like this was a protective coating but didn&#x27;t do much to heal my skin so much as amend the appearance of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I will use it when summer comes around and see if its any different.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used alot of makeup and don&#x27;t like the feel of alot of gunk on my face.  I&#x27;ve also always had a hard time accepting the marketing hype about moisturizers.  Thirty years ago, I discovered shea butter.  Ever since, I&#x27;ve looked for that ingredient when buying anything that goes on my face but rarely find it and when I do, it&#x27;s usually the second to the last ingredient listed in a very expensive concoction.  (The last time I bought a moisturizer with shea butter, it was in a $50 tube that lasted less than a month.)  So I was happy to find this product online listing shea butter as the primary ingredient (second only to water) and happier still to get three times as much for $12.  Some people have reviewed it saying it&#x27;s too solid or too white and doesn&#x27;t soak in.  That has not been my experience.  In the jar, it has the texture of Noxzema but doesn&#x27;t sit on your skin. It&#x27;s immediately absorbed and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all.  It makes my skin feel really soft and healthy.</li>
    <li> I Live in the high desert, very dry all year long and this moisturizer is unbelievably rich. I am in my late 50s and this is the best cream I have ever purchased. I have been using it for several months and have noticed a big differance in that the lines have softened on my face and new ones have not appeared because of this great moisurizer. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> The scent of this cream is distinct, but I like it. It might be the lavender or sage in it. The consistency is thick, but you don&#x27;t need much to cover your face/neck and it absorbs well. I&#x27;ve been looking for a shea butter face cream, and it&#x27;s a big plus that this one lists shea butter as the second ingredient on the label.</li>
    <li> have not used yet, tried it on the back of my hand and it seems to feel very nice. Will let you know.</li>
    <li> After years of searching for a facial moisturizer, I finally found the one to LOVE!...My skin is on the dry side and this cream brings it back to life. I find it to be an incredible bargain at this price level. I have paid many times more for a similar amount that just didn&#x27;t do the job. Thank you Kasny Recon for developing such a wonderful product. I am amazed how my skin feels and looks. I plan on trying many more of your products. THANK YOU!</li>
    <li> I have tried so many kinds of creams and finally I hit the jackpot. I was a little hesitant about using it at night but I took the risk and in the morning my face was not oily like with the other lotions. I have been using it for a while and no breakouts, not even one! Its great now I&#x27;m using all shea touch products and theyre really good.  No herbal smell either.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell, it&#x27;s to strong</li>
    <li> The product is great on face and really worth it ...&lt;br /&gt;when i first received the product,I got only half the quantity,When I reported they sent me a new one in less than one week</li>
    <li> This product is okay but if you have sensitive or oily skin, I do not recommend this. I use it on my hands, legs, feet, elbows and knees instead.</li>
    <li> I have tried every product you can imagine and before this one I had such bad reactions.  My skin being fair and extremely sensitive had problems with every thing.  I put it on before I go to bed and right before I apply my makeup.  My skin absorbs it instantly and is silky smooth.  Not to mention is smells fantastic.  I would recommend it without thinking twice.  The only problem I have is keeping it away from my teenage daughter!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think is good it leaves my skin with a dry feeling. I know natural shea butter is a good product for the skin. I will give another try ortherwise i just waste my money.</li>
    <li> I love this cream and hope it never goes away!  My face is very sensitive and this is the only one that doesnt make me feel greasy and break me out.  It lasts a long time too.  Its a great product!</li>
    <li> 44 years old African American female. Very dry skin. I have tried and spent money on expensive moisturizers. I have been using this for three weeks and it has made a difference in my skin. I have gotten compliments on my skin since using this cream. I use it morning and night. I put it on under my makeup. It is not greasy or heavy. I use a lot because my skin is just so dry but a little does go a long way. I just like to saturate my skin. This is worth the money!</li>
    <li> This cream is easy to apply and feels good on my face.  It is not greasy.  Ignore its natural SPF, for that is minimal, but I do recommend the product, and I haven&#x27;t found it in stores.</li>
    <li> Oh my! This cream is unbelievable! It&#x27;s SO moisturizing and absorbs into skin so quickly. Amazing natural ingredients. You will LOVE it. Great for hands too!! Buy it!!</li>
    <li> I am in love with this lotion! It absorbs right into my skin, non greasy, and nice smell. I have mixed skin, oily in some spots, dry in others, blotchy redness in some spots, and I&#x27;ve had mild to medium breakouts since I was a teen. I&#x27;ve had this lotion for about a week, and I can see the color evening out! Also no breakouts since starting.  I think it&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin that&#x27;s prone to rashes and breakouts.  This cream is an excellent hypoallergenic treatment.  Goes on a little waxy, but that feature goes away after an hour.  Really good price.</li>
    <li> The ingredients are all natural and very high quality.  The 3oz quantity is a lot compared to what you would get in a department store for the same quality.  It adsorbs easily and makes my skin feel soft.  great&amp;#60;</li>
    <li> My skin is extremely dry - i have to apply a moisturizer as soon as I wash my face, else it feel stretched. I have tried many different moisturizers - some very expensive ones too. I love this one so far, as it makes my skin feel very healthy. I am on my second box now...</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  When I first got it I thought it was kind of thick and was worried it would be too heavy but it wasn&#x27;t.  It goes on nice and smooth, not oily at all.  I probably have normal to dry skin.  I also have issues with slight redness on my cheeks and forehead.  With this product, all that redness is gone if I&#x27;m consistent in using this product.  I also noticed by &amp;#34;smile&amp;#34; lines around my eyes have diminished.  I&#x27;m on my second bottle.  It lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> great product but the cream is a little greasy and not as thick as you would expect from a cream.,., it&#x27;s a little close to regular lotion if you know the difference...but still is a good product if you are willing to pay the price</li>
    <li> I got this lotion because it has a low toxicity rating on the EWG website.  However, I do not like that it makes my face feel waxy after I put it on.  Whenever I put my make up on over top of it, the make up did not spread around well and it appeared as if I was putting too much make up on.  I stopped using this product and started using coconut oil instead, much better results with that.  I&#x27;ll keep this stuff around and use it up, but I won&#x27;t be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> Great natural moisturizer. I love that it its very rich and goes on great. There is a lot of product in the jar so it will last a long time. I love the ingredients used in this face cream, very natural and simple. This face cream overall is an excellent cream to use. This is a great face moisturizer to use everyday, a very nice product!</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this moisturizer. I&#x27;ve been using this for a month now and I love how this made my skin smooth and pimple free.</li>
    <li> This product is far too oily and heavy for a face cream.  I would only recommend this if you have very dry skin.  If you have normal to oily skin, you&#x27;re better off looking for a more lightweight moisturizer.  I&#x27;m now using this as a body cream instead.</li>
    <li> I like a super-moisturizing heavy cream that leaves my skin soft and moist and this is just not heavy enough - it absorbs well and would probably be good for normal to slightly dry skin.</li>
    <li> I sent this to my mother, who was having problems with rashes and sensitivity to face creams. She loved this. It is simple, deeply enriching and it feels very pure.</li>
