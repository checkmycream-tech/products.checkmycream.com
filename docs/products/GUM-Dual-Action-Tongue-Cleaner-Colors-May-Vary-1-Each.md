<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the brush and It&#x27;s not sharp enough to do a good job of cleaning.  I through the junk thing away.</li>
    <li> The plastic tongue cleaner is all you really need. Does the job beautifully. If you&#x27;re currently not using a tongue cleaner, you&#x27;ll be impressed on the difference this makes, even if you already have good breath. The clean feeling that comes after you use it is not achievable with just toothbrush+floss.</li>
    <li> Great tongue cleaner.  This is the 2nd brand I&#x27;ve tried and prefer this one as it has a brush on the back.  So, 2 in 1.  Good product.</li>
    <li> This is just a great product. I used to brush my tongue with my tooth brush, but this works so much better. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have a different tongue cleaner (metal tongue sweeper) that I normally use. But the plastic GUM model also works fine. If I lose the metal one, I would go back to using the GUM tongue cleaner.</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how well this works.</li>
    <li> Like this smaller version. Not gagging as much</li>
    <li> Okay I got this cause I had seen stuff like this in the past before. I figured why not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far it works pretty well. I know some people have made the comment in the past &amp;#34;you can use a spoon to do the same thing.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Not really, this one actually has bristles that scrub the tongue and help get that stuff stuff under the hairs. The scraping part could maybe be done with a spoon maybe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe so far is purely cosmetic in that I wanted a blue one and received a redish one. But hey, colors may vary is there for a reason. If you&#x27;re looking for something like this then id get it, its pretty cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are a bit hard on it, so don&#x27;t expect them to move very easily, they are made for scrubbing the tongue. And the scraping part, has a wave like design to it, its not straight across like a spoon is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s my review, hope it helped.</li>
    <li> Worked as intended with not as much gag inducing reflex as using a toothbrush. It was quicker and more accurate than a toothbrush as well, covering a greater surface area of the tongue in a quicker amount of time. It also allowed for a greater use of force versus a toothbrush.</li>
    <li> i love this and it really does work just be sure to brush first then use the scraper to avoid bleeding</li>
    <li> the first time I ordered these they were lost in transit so I contacted Amazon and they refunded my money right away and I reordered and received them on time. Exactly what I was looking for. They bristles are not to soft but not to hard, the scraper on the other side did hurt my tongue the first time I used it but after that I knew not to do it so hard. I do plan on buying these again when I need to. Would also recommend to friends and family. I bought one for my husband as well.</li>
    <li> I have tried several brands of tongue scrapers. This product, the GUM Tongue Cleaner, is uncomfortable to use. The brush is no more effective than a toothbrush and the scraper is way too harsh on my tongue.  Even using a light touch, my tongue bleeds almost every time I use this scraper. Care of the tongue is supposed to be gentle. Because constant irritation can lead to infection or even disease, I am concerned about a product which causes irritation and bleeding with regular use. I also have [[ASIN:B005U8DZ4A 1 Pack Orabrush Tongue Cleaner Scraper]]. The Orabrush has a nice brush but does not scrape well. I also have [[ASIN:B000RDRLJS DenTek Tongue Cleaner - 1 Ea Sku Hd 1752484]].  I use it with the Orabrush. I&#x27;ve tried [[ASIN:B00E4MPRZ8 Dentek Dentek Comfort Clean Tongue Cleaner, 1 each (Pack of 3)]] and it choked me.  The only positive thing I have to say about the GUM Tongue Cleaner is that is has a narrow profile and does not cause gagging. I am going to continue to use the Orabrush Tongue Cleaner and Den Tek Tongue Cleaner until something better comes along.</li>
    <li> I agree with the person who rated it a 3. I wanted it to get all the gook at the back of my tongue. The stuff that I could literally see back there but could never reach.&lt;br /&gt;*I used the brush side and started making gag noises.&lt;br /&gt;*Yeah it&#x27;s just like a toothbrush, but I can get more done with a regular brush.&lt;br /&gt;*Like another person said, it caused me some tongue bleeding, so I had to scrub softer and still didn&#x27;t get much off.&lt;br /&gt;*&amp; lastly, it um, didn&#x27;t reach back there and get any of the junk, b/c I kept gagging and it just couldn&#x27;t reeach. Waste of my money.</li>
    <li> The brush side is great for loosening plaque on your tongue, and then you use the other side to scrape off the plaque. It&#x27;s holding up great and it works pretty well. It does give your tongue a slightly rough feeling after use, and I have not been able to get my tongue perfectly pink. I have never used any other tongue brushes so I can&#x27;t give a comparison. I use it every time I brush my teeth! Definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> This is great product that for some reason is hard to find at local stores in my area. For a heavy coffee drinker like me, this is a great help to get that deep cleaning twice a day.</li>
    <li> A perfect tongue cleaner.  I use it daily without gagging, and I would recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> I use a small tongue cleaner that works just fine and I thought to upgrade with this elaborate G.U.M. cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;after just one use I was disappointed and throw it in the garbage.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a while. It&#x27;s sturdy and effective. It cleans really well and is gentle on the tongue.</li>
    <li> Stores in my area no longer carry this item. I don&#x27;t know why. The tongue scraper is one of the best products I have used. I went through Amazon becaue I trust your validity. Thank you for having the product and for the timely response I received my package. Karen M. Smith</li>
    <li> random color. mine came in red. the brush is 2 layers of in between soft and medium bristles  on the other side is 2 layers of jagged scraper things. not too round but not too sharp. its literally perfect</li>
    <li> The Butler G.U.M Fresh-R Tooth Cleaner does the job and I like the feeling of the bristles on my tongue-it&#x27;s like a massage.:-)</li>
    <li> It really feels like you&#x27;re cleaning your mouth vs the other regular tongue scraper. I love how it&#x27;s double sided, really gets all the gunk off your tongue and you feel nice and refreshed after</li>
    <li> By far the best tongue cleaner out there. This dual action tongue scraper is awesome. The brush side has good strong bristles to scrape and clean your tongue. The other side has a hard plastic scraper which is what I was looking for and works very well.  I am very satisfied with this product, I threw and way the other 3 scrapers I had once this one arrived. It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> Its a good tongue cleaner.  Works well and gives the feeling of light tongue and freshness. It has two sided cleaner, I guess, thats what makes it special.</li>
    <li> Works well. Cleans my tongue. All I do is brush, scrape and then rinse with mouthwash. I like it alot</li>
    <li> The hard side of this tongue cleaner is wavy and ineffective...does not scrape evenly...and is so hard as to be painful.  The bristles are too stiff and also painful to use.  I&#x27;m sticking with the brand I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I used a Tongue Cleaner and I really like it.  My mouth feels much cleaner and I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> The cleaner was as advertised I like it used it everyday &amp; works pretty well with my mouth wash I use</li>
    <li> Just what I needed as a second tongue cleaner to keep permanently in my travel cosmetic bag.  Love the double sided options for cleaning the tongue.  Size is great.  Not to large to cause any &amp;#34;gaging&#x27; while using</li>
    <li> Good quality. Helps with bad breath. Cleans the bacteria from your tongue. So much better than using a toothbrush. Very comfortable and easy to use. Shipping did take a long time .</li>
    <li> I had expectations for this, but it turns out to be disappointing. Even my electronic toothbrush cleans my tongue more effectively than this. A waste of money.</li>
    <li> i think its the best tongue scraper b/c it has the brushes and then the scraper... the best!! would buy again!!</li>
    <li> The bristles are a bit weird, and you&#x27;ll have to use quite a few scrubs to get everything, but it serves its purpose and is a huge upgrade from a toothbrush alone. The non-bristle side is surprisingly effective on its own too.</li>
    <li> Works great, Breath and tongue feel cleaner and fresh, doesn&#x27;t make you choke or gag, would buy another when and if needed.</li>
    <li> Its inexpensive and it works great. It lasts a long time too! I recommend it for you to use it before going on a date!!</li>
    <li> This little tool is so friggin&#x27; amazing, I couldn&#x27;t believe it! When it arrived to my house, I rushed to my bathroom to try it out. I put in a dot of toothpaste on my tongue, run water over the tongue cleaner, and went straight to work. The \\&quot;claw\\&quot; side of it REALLY scratched all the nasty white gunk out of my tongue, it was so disgusting seeing it in action, but at the same time it strangely satisfied me seeing all of it finally coming out of my tongue. I kept at it for a minute or so, and then use the soft brush side to brush. I rinse my mouth, stick out my tongue, and OMG- 95% of the white stuff? GONE. GONE GONE GONE! I was so shocked and amazed! I do need to practice on getting it all the way to the back (it&#x27;s still a bit white back there), but otherwise? My tongue is soft, healthy, clean, and beautifully red... just the way nature intended it to be! I&#x27;m going to order a few more for my family now. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember: Your bad breath doesn&#x27;t come from your teeth, the insides of your cheeks or even your gums- It&#x27;s that NASTY white stuff on your tongue that&#x27;s causing all the trouble! So put that monster in place with this tool!</li>
    <li> I bought a single tongue cleaner to try it out first in case it didn&#x27;t work out, but I&#x27;m very impressed by it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been through many of these cleaners and found it difficult to find something that worked well. This product does a pretty good job for me.</li>
    <li> Love it! Cant live without it. Cleans your tongue great leaving breath more refreshing. I have been using this product for many years and will continue using it.  I would def recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> this product does the job as it was intended. the price is very cheap compared to a lot of other products like these.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this one, the one side of it just hurts, and the other side doesn&#x27;t do much. There are better ones out there...</li>
    <li> I recommend this product. It has cleaned my tongue so well I hadn&#x27;t have anymore thrush bacteria in my mouth anymore and will save you tons of money at the dentist office.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t love or hate it.  I don&#x27;t know what I was expecting, but it&#x27;s not amazing.  It&#x27;s basically a thinner toothbrush.</li>
    <li> This is one of those tools that you don&#x27;t know you need until you actually use one.  Do yourself a favor and go to the store and buy a cheap tongue scraper.  Then once you can&#x27;t do without this tool, then go to Amazon and buy this.  I have never used a tongue scraper until my sister introduced me to it.  Why would I need one when I use my toothbrush to scrape my tongue, right?  Using this tool gets so much grime and grossness out of your mouth and tongue that you didn&#x27;t even know you had.  Your mouth won&#x27;t feel clean until after you&#x27;ve used it, period.</li>
    <li> I have tried 3 of the best known tongue brushes on the market these days - Tung, Orabrush and GUM. I like Orabrush and this GUM tongue cleaners about the same. Tung&#x27;s bristles are too hard and make my tongue bleed sometimes, leaving my tongue smarting. Orabrush starts out absolutely perfect when brand new. However, after a week or 2, its synthetic material (silicone?) bristles lose their firmness and become too soft to do the job. The GUM tongue cleaner has bristles on one side and a scraper on the flip side. The brush is perfect for loosening all the gunk on your tongue. However, the scraper side is corrugated/wavy instead of being just flat. This causes the scraper to scratch your tongue and cause discomfort while not doing a great job cleaning. The scraper would have been much more effective in cleaning as well as in comfort if it were just flat instead of being corrugated. I still find myself using the GUM tongue cleaner more often than the other two, thanks to the brush side. I hope GUM one day will start making tongue scraper side flat.</li>
    <li> I just got this from my girlfriend, and I tried it for the first time tonight. It was delightful! The two sets of bristles are just the right length and firmness, and they do a great job. I love this product, and I would highly recommend it. :)</li>
    <li> It cleans your tongue to a pinky, cleanness. I love it. I never knew there was such a thing, and now I use it every night. Yay!</li>
    <li> Hadn&#x27;t used one of these prior, but they do make a huge difference for your breath. It is much easier to use one of these than a toothbrush, and this brand does a good job. Seems like a sturdy product that should last at least a few months before needing replace.</li>
    <li> Using a tongue scraper is a great idea. Using this tongue scraper is a terrible idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two design flaws with this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  1. Too thin -- you need several more passes to get the job done&lt;br /&gt;  2. Ruffled -- unless you have serious caking on your tongue (like, the amount of frosting on a cake) then the ridges on this product will be more painful than helpful</li>
    <li> Love it! Scrapes my tongue very well. Feels fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> Best tongue scraper I have ever come across. This isn&#x27;t available in stores anymore where I live, so I had to turn to amazon to get a new one. It just works well.</li>
    <li> This is a standard tongue cleaner that does an ok job at getting the job done.  Nothing too special about it, it&#x27;s wavy design makes it a little bit more difficult to use (but I guess slightly easier for some).  I actually preferred the Orabrush tongue cleaner better than this one - it&#x27;s a bit more expensive, but definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> Hard to find these two in ones that do it right! If I just scrape then sometimes it hurts, but the brush loosening stuff up helps a lot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to change them out after a couple of months, as they do get disgusting!</li>
    <li> Your above average tongue scraper. Gets the job done. I gave this to my grandmother because she claimed the Orabrush was a bit soft.</li>
    <li> perfect in removing gross from your tongue</li>
    <li> Great tongue cleaner! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t use it. Got it for my ex boyfriend.</li>
    <li> I have been using this tongue cleaner if you will for a long time. I have tried other brands but this one seems to do the job without much discomfort. The business end is soft which greatly adds to the comfort. I thought this was better than brand that offer bristles at the end for scraping the tongue. Definitely recommend purchasing this.</li>
    <li> Simple and effective. Has one job and does it well. I like the capability offered with the two differing sides.</li>
    <li> Works very well. Works better than the previous one I had, which did not have the brushes. For whatever reason, the brushes substantially improve the effectiveness of the cleaner.</li>
    <li> My instinct was to purchase this item, but I made the mistake of going with one of the wide, straight-edged Pureline products first. After having tried it, I just don&#x27;t understand how a straight-edged piece of hard plastic is supposed to effectively clean the uneven surface of the tongue, and I don&#x27;t know why I thought it would. The Pureline product wasn&#x27;t worthwhile at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The GUM cleaner, however, does the job extremely well. The brush is necessary to break up material, then the scraper takes it right off. It&#x27;s easy and leaves the tongue pink and fresh, something I couldn&#x27;t achieve with the other product. I was concerned because one reviewer criticized the zig-zag edge of the scraper, but it hasn&#x27;t been a problem at all. I believe it might even aid the design, since evenly distributed pressure was a major disadvantage of the Pureline cleaner. The narrower width helps a lot with the gag reflex; I still struggle with it at the very back, but that&#x27;s not something the GUM cleaner could have made any easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flawless product - I wish I had gone straight for this.</li>
    <li> The brush cleans the tongue very well.  I just don&#x27;t like the other side as it doesn&#x27;t work as well as a flat end.  I have a tongue cleaner without a brush and it&#x27;s just flat which works a lot better and doesn&#x27;t cause bleeding.</li>
    <li> Use it every morning.</li>
    <li> Favorite tongue cleaner.  Perfect shape and design.  Great price.</li>
    <li> This Gum Tongue Cleaner is a nice product. It helps a little. Most likely, using this tongue cleaner makes me gag. And sometimes my tongue would bleed a little. I still have my Orabrush Tongue Cleaner. Imma still give this product a 5 star rating.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve went without this product for so long. This little tool is amazing.</li>
    <li> Really impressed with this little tool - perfect size for me.  This is my first tongue scraper and I have to say it makes a huge difference.  I use it after I brush and floss, before mouth wash, and it has become part of my routine very quickly.  If I ever lose it I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy another.</li>
    <li> I started using this every morning as part of a 40 Day Baptiste Yoga Challenge back in the winter.  I can&#x27;t start my day without it now.  It&#x27;s amazing the difference it makes.</li>
    <li> I used to have a lot smaller one that came with my ultrasonic tooth brush, and the difference is immense.  I can&#x27;t believe the stuff that keeps coming off from my tongue for several times.</li>
    <li> Tried this once and haven&#x27;t gone back since. I started to taste things a bit better and I can&#x27;t go a day without cleaning my tongue now</li>
    <li> I am a total fan of this tongue cleaner!  It has the best of both worlds.  It has the brush to loosen things up, and the scraper to finish the job.  PERFECT!    Durable and long lasting too!  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> You ain&#x27;t never had a clean mouth until you use this. I never knew how good your tongue can get clean buy using this product. I don&#x27;t see how I ever lived without this product. It freshens your mouth and cleans so good. I never knew how dirty your tongue can be. Trust me, get this and you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Works better and lasts longer than any brand I have tried!!! Love it!</li>
    <li> cleans tongue well with out any plastic after taste. my mouth is fresher for it,thanks! will prob buy again in the future!</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dental hygienist and works great.  Very inexpensive, too!</li>
    <li> This thing is gross but great! My mom told me that she had cured her bad breath problem with use of a tongue scraper and I thought I&#x27;d try it for myself... It feels good to do this-although it does not feel good to look at the slime that comes off your tongue-ew. I don&#x27;t know if it has helped my breath, but my mouth feels cleaner after I use it! Plus, my dentist recommends that I brush my tongue to remove as much bacteria from my mouth as possible.</li>
    <li> Different than the ones I had found at the store (this one has bristles on one side)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;works great and helps with breath issues and keeping you feeling fresher</li>
    <li> For the perfectly clean mouth, I use a waterpik, followed by a brushing, and then the GUM Tongue Cleaner to finish the job. So clean, I can lick my dog.</li>
    <li> Bought these based on the reviews and it&#x27;s pretty decent. The scrapper is not the best out there, but with the brush is pretty strong and seems very durable. Just for that I&#x27;ll give it a 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Wavy Scraping edge makes it hard to clean entire surface of tongue effectively. (you are always going to miss spots since you won&#x27;t be lining up the ridges every time you scrap.)&lt;br /&gt;Wavy edges doesn&#x27;t scrape junk to front. Just scrapes tongue and leaves junk where it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 blades&lt;br /&gt;Brush on the other side for tongue brushing (should make the bristles shorter and stiffer).&lt;br /&gt;Does not trigger gag reflex&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to improve: if you want a wavy edge, make the second scraping edge flat. Or if you want two wavy edges, stagger the ridges so that the back blade covers the hole the front blade leaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think having a wavy front and a flat back edge would be great.</li>
    <li> For the past 3 or 4 months i have been having issues with bad breath. I would brush after every meal and sometimes more than that. But even after i brushed i would have a sense that i was still unclean. I thought i was being paranoid until i got a whiff of my own breath. Whoa. That stuff was kickin&#x27;.     So for about a month i&#x27;ve been trying to take chlorophyll (which supposedly cleans you out and you won&#x27;t have bad breath anymore), and brush with different toothpastes. Then i saw this product on amazon and I decided \\&quot;what the hell.\\&quot; So i bought it. I excitedly ran to the bathroom when i got it at 2 this afternoon. I cleaned my tongue and ta-da! i&#x27;m still smellin&#x27; like a peppermint patty at 11 at night. I haven&#x27;t brushed since lunch. Pa-dow.</li>
    <li> My tongue is a very natural red/pink color after using this, and my breath is much fresher! My whole mouth feels cleaner in general.</li>
    <li> This item works much better than the ones that come with the Breath Rx Tongue Care Kit. First one I received was from my dentist.</li>
    <li> Wonderful tongue cleaner. Does the job and it not expensive at all, compared to the one that I got in a local pharmacy store.</li>
    <li> After reading an article about the benefits of cleaning one&#x27;s tongue as part of an effective oral hygiene regimen, I purchased The GUM tongue cleaner. I used it; one edge has a small brush along it and the other edge is plastic.  Apart from immediately gagging, it did remove stuff on my tongue, especially the brush side.  Now, if they would construct these things as not to be gag-inducing, they would be perfect!</li>
    <li> Does not work as intended. My tongue pains and it hardly removes the coating.  I use a different product now.</li>
    <li> too mediocre for something that&#x27;s not included in a toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Works well, minimal pain or unpleasant feeling from scraping side. Brush side is handy.</li>
    <li> I used to use Pureline Tongue Cleaners, but Wal-Mart stopped selling them.  I ordered one of this GUM brand through Wal-Mart&#x27;s site to store.  I was very disappointed in it.  Firstly, the head is very flexible, so it did not clean as well as the other brand.  Secondly, the head is quite small, and I constantly gagged myself with it, so I ended up ordering a three pack of the Pureline brand through Amazon.  I paid more than I really wanted to pay for them, but I am glad to have the Pureline again.  It cleans so much better, and I do not gag myself with it.  Sorry, GUM, but I cannot recommend your tongue cleaner to others.</li>
    <li> I stopped using it because who cares. I don&#x27;t notice any benefits, though I didn&#x27;t have any problems in the first place. I don&#x27;t know why I bought this. I saw people in a forum extolling it&#x27;s virtue and wanted to try it.</li>
    <li> Got this for a houseguest who forgot theirs at home and she said it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a tongue brush. It brushes your tongue. It works.</li>
    <li> It was nearly 5 years ago I bought my first GUM tongue cleaner!  I now use it daily and nightly with great pride!  I highly recommend this item!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for probably two years now (just now reviewing all my amazon purchases)&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this tongue scrapper.&lt;br /&gt;Every other one I&#x27;ve had, lasted maybe six months, then breaks.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend, it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think that tongue cleaners are as noticed as they should be.&lt;br /&gt;They do an amazing job at cleaning the tongue and helping improve&lt;br /&gt;your breath smell. I have been using these tongue cleaners for a long time,&lt;br /&gt;and this cleaner is one of the best that I have used. There is a scraper on one side&lt;br /&gt;and a brush on the other side. The results are somewhat instant when using this product.&lt;br /&gt;If you have a more &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; tongue it will probably take one or two more &amp;#34;sessions&amp;#34; of use&lt;br /&gt;to get you back to a nice, clean, healthy tongue.</li>
    <li> Probably the best tongue cleaner out there. Works fantastic!</li>
    <li> IF YOU NEVER USED ONE OF THEM...... TRYING IT IS NOT WANTING TO GO WITHOUT ONE.&lt;br /&gt;AND IT LASTS FOREVER AND EVER.</li>
    <li> I really like the dual action design of this product.  you can brush your tongue with one side, and then scrape away all the debris with the other.  I like how thinly designed the head is... I have a pretty bad gag reflex and I have zero issues when using this product (unlike when I was trying to use my toothbrush).</li>
    <li> I wish it had a softer rubber squeegee material to scrape your toungue.  This is hard serated plastic that doesn&#x27;t feel good, and doesn&#x27;t work well. Would look for something else.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe I lived without this for so long!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s high quality, well designed and sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush on one side helps scrub the tongue and then the hard grooved plastic edge on the other side sweeps it clean.&lt;br /&gt;Much better that trying to use your tooth brush and gagging on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just like flossing, this is a critical piece of my oral cleaning regime.</li>
    <li> nice stiff bristles to brush tongue thoroughly and scraper on reverse. great for removing bacteria (white coloration on tongue) that cause bad breath. unable to find in stores...glad to find here at low price</li>
    <li> Wife loves the product; she claims that her tounge is cleaner than ever...</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with my product. I actually brought this product in Target, then for some reason they stopped selling it....its real nice. You have the brush on one side and the scraper on the other side. I&#x27;m glad I was able to google this product. When I need another one, I will be coming to amazon.com</li>
    <li> Excellent. I love it this tongue cleaner&lt;br /&gt;Does the job like its suppose too.&lt;br /&gt;Unlike a tooth brush when you do it too much it starts to sting</li>
    <li> I received the product on time &amp; in great condition as the cleanser works great, replacing my old one that I had for a little too long</li>
    <li> Great product! Keep using it for years! They don&#x27;t have them in local Walmart and need to be replaced as often like toothbrush, so online is the only way or overseas any grocery store :) Great seller, fast shipping, unopened, brand new! No problems! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This tounge cleaner can be a little rough when you first start using it.  Once you get the hang of what your mouth can hadle it is a great cleaner.  It is two sided with a scraper and rubber bristles.</li>
    <li> Quality product.  Seems durable and effective.  Not too big and not too small.  The only downside is that this product should be more along the lines of an add-on and the price point could be lower.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it says it will and is gentle on the tongue.  The inclusion of a brush makes it really effective.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great. It has the brush and scraper on opposite sides, unlike a very popular brand name tongue cleaner. It is also gentler on my tongue tha said popular tongue cleaner.</li>
    <li> Got three of these...one for me, the hubbie and my daughter.  I don&#x27;t know if this is really making a difference when I use this.  I&#x27;ve been using for about a week.  I had another wider one (I have to look for it in my closet) that seemed to do a better job.  It had a flatter edge.  This one has a brush on one side and a side with like a comb like area (don&#x27;t know how else to describe it) so it doesn&#x27;t scrape the whole tongue in one swoop.  My old one scraped the whole tongue and my tongue felt cleaner.</li>
    <li> My husband and I are fanatic about oral hygiene.  you might be too after experiencing the true clean feeling delivered by this simple tool.  We love them!!</li>
    <li> This actually helps with morning breath and bad breath a good amount. You should still pair it with flossing and mouthwash and brushing, but this is a huge improvement over brushing your tongue with a toothbrush and has a much longer life than your standard toothbrush. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> This tongue cleaner is a must have for everyone. It is very gentle on your tongue but keeps the mouths extra clean.</li>
    <li> Works great for the price.</li>
    <li> Solid product, does the job.</li>
    <li> nice sturdy piece to hold while scraping  away morning breath</li>
    <li> Useless garbage.  There are MUCH better ones on Amazon that do a much better job.  This is worse than a toothbrush.  You need a SCRAPER, not a cleaner, so look for that.</li>
    <li> They say that to get rid of bad breath, you should always remember to brush your tongue. I&#x27;ve sort of been a bit revolted by the idea of using my toothbrush to brush my tongue (perhaps a little unfounded was my revulsion). Enter: GUM Tongue Cleaner (colors may vary). No longer do I have to be revolted to the point of gagging when cleaning my tongue. BONUS! There are two sides to this tongue cleaner: one side with bristles and the other side with corrugated plastic. I&#x27;ll never be self conscious about having bad breath again after using this product.</li>
    <li> works great and mouth feels really clean after using it. It is especially good for people with gag reflexes. the shape helps is reducing the gag reflex.</li>
    <li> My tongue went from Pale white to PINK!  its so Squeaky Clean now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PERFECT  for MEN, WOMEN and CHILDREN!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t make you gag&lt;br /&gt;Small (just the right size) &amp; not so wide that you have to force yourself to keep your mouth open like competitor standard wide scrubbers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For men&lt;br /&gt;For women&lt;br /&gt;For children&lt;br /&gt;Has brush&lt;br /&gt;Low price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: None :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW TO USE?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Place scrubber with flat side on your tongue and gently RAKE your tongue outward&lt;br /&gt;Next flip scrubber to brush side and and use brush like Rake in a Y\\&quot; Shape outward  then flip scrubber to flat side and rake outward&lt;br /&gt; Next repeat step 2 &amp; 3 several times&lt;br /&gt;Congratulations ! YOU ARE A PRO TONGUE SCRUBBER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This scrubber, is perfect for the whole family, I bought one for all of us and everyone liked it, even my 8 yr. old.  Don&#x27;t be fooled by the wider ones, or the stainless steel version.  This one gets the job done PERFECTLY! It&#x27;s the right size too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparison:&lt;br /&gt;My sister and her 6 year old son use the wide version and both of them gag so much, I knew I didn&#x27;t want to try the wide version.  Thats why i did research, and decided to try a smaller size, but trust me the size is perfect. This is so easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You, should really try it, I can&#x27;t Believe most dentist don&#x27;t recommend this more often.  They really should because your mouth feels&lt;br /&gt;100 % percent more cleaner.  I thought, my tongue was clean after scrubbing with my toothbrush but I was wrong.  I sort of felt guilty not knowing this but, thank God I know now about tongue scrubbing.  This is funny, but it made me think of the shark tale movie with Wil Smith washing the whales.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you&#x27;ll try this scrubber, I&#x27;m so glad I did. &#x3D;) There won&#x27;t be no gagging in my bathrooms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You, should try it, the price is really inexpensive that it won&#x27;t be a dent or loss to your wallet.&lt;br /&gt;Kind regards, From this Blessed Mommy</li>
    <li> My order arrived really fast. This is my first tongue cleaner purchase and I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> Great for the price. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Works great way better than using your tooth brush gagging. It showed up when promised and feels good in the hand and mouth.</li>
    <li> Best tongue cleaner on the market. Practical and efficient design. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the gimmicks from other newer brands. This isn&#x27;t new technology. Putting it plain, it just works.</li>
    <li> Only tongue cleaner I use.  I have always brushed my tongue when I brush my teeth.  A habit my family picked up in Japan way back when.  This cleaner has small stiff bristles and a scrapper to get the gross stuff off the tongue and out of the mouth.  I am convinced this habit has helped prevent bad breath and cavities.</li>
    <li> Have used other scrapers, but this one is the very best I&#x27;ve used.  The scraper works well and does not hurt when used properly.</li>
    <li> Holy crap, this thing gets a lot of gunk out! I&#x27;m sold for life on this device.</li>
    <li> I was checking reviews about a lot of tongue cleaners and I had doubts which one to buy, since none of them is very expensive I ordered 5 different tongue cleaners.&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with GUM tongue cleaner, it is the best one !!! The brush is firm, it does not leave any gunk on your tongue and the scrapper works just well.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this tongue cleaner to anyone, whoever wants a fresh breath all day should definitely buy this product!</li>
    <li> Great product. Fast shipping. Thanks</li>
    <li> Keeps my tongue clean.</li>
    <li> not using it..the regular tooth brush does the same. Sorry but it is the truth.</li>
    <li> I use this tongue cleaner to get a good indication of my health.  If I am less healthy, I&#x27;ll see more gunk, and I notice that when I eat better and drink less alcohol, my tongue is cleaner. Either way it&#x27;s a healthy habit that I&#x27;ve started getting into and I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this Tongue Scraper. It really does make me feel cleaner. After a few uses you always want to start your mornings and finish your day with scrapping otherwise you feel like moss is on your tongue.</li>
    <li> My tongue is pinker than ever. This tongue cleaner has become a part of my nightly routine.</li>
    <li> Many of these tongue cleaners are way too large for the female mouth.  This one covers the Goldilocks Issue beautifully.</li>
    <li> After using it, I don&#x27;t want to stop because now I&#x27;m aware of how dirty my tongue really is...  Don&#x27;t use it unless you&#x27;re ready to become aware of how dirty your tongue can get in a day.  Just scrub the tongue with the bristles, and scrape the nasty off back to front.  Pretty easy.</li>
    <li> Worked well, but was a little flimsy</li>
    <li> This tongue cleaner doesn&#x27;t clean as well as metal ones, but it would be better than nothing.</li>
    <li> This one is the best, why is it so hard to find in NYC drugstores these days? What makes this one stand out for me are the grooved edge on the hard side and the fact that the handle itself is very stiff. I find that using other brands that are more flexible, I can&#x27;t press on my tongue as much and get the embedded gunk. I also find that flat edge cleaners don&#x27;t collect as much film. I keep one at home, one at work, one in the suitcase and one in the car! Breath is so much fresher for longer than with brushing alone.</li>
    <li> This tongue cleaner get&#x27;s the job perfect! I use it everyday! It is super easy to clean and is built tough to last.</li>
    <li> This tongue cleaner is the best and I would recommend everyone use it. I buy multiple at a time for everyone in my house hold. Very clean and doest the best job out of all other cleaners I have used.</li>
    <li> my son tends to have the milk residue on his tongue since he drinks a bottle still, thankfully he lets me clean his tongue with this product it works rather well.</li>
    <li> my son asked me for it and i got it. it did not come with whatever tube of whatever is shown on the picture posted here, but in the posting i ordered from it didn&#x27;t have that anyway.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed the huge difference this product does. Bad breath is practically non existent, my teeth have never felt this clean in my life.</li>
    <li> This tongue cleaner did the trick but I definitely would use it again if orabrush wasn&#x27;t in the picture. yup.</li>
