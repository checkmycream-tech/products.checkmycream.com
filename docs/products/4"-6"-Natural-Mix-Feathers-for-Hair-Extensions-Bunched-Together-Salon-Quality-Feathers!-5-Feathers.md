      <li>i love these things.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really pleased with them.</li>

      <li>These are even better than the ones at my salon.  </li>
      <li>You can also trim the top of the extension that may be sticking out from the top of the bead where your hair root is.</li>
      <li>so you will get a better information.</li>
      <li>i was very excited to put them in my hair.</li>
      <li>These arrived fast and are just gorgeous.  </li>
      <li>I thought I wouldn&#x27;t like the fact that they&#x27;re joined together, but it made the process of putting them in and making sure they&#x27;re all facing the right way so easy!</li>
      <li>so I can hide these easily if I want to.  </li>
      <li>Not only did the extension look beautiful, but it included two of the crimping beads for easy installation.</li>
      <li>They were long, beautifully colored, and very high quality (including many of the popular grizzly feathers).</li>
      <li>I got these feathers in about 2 weeks ago, they were amazing straight out of the package.</li>
      <li>They are simple to put in yourself, and look great.</li>
      <li>So in the end it was worth it for sure</li>
      <li>Super easy to put in.  </li>
      <li>Not only are these feathers nice, but they arrived super fast and are about 1/4 of what the price is in a beauty supply store (not that I saw any in a store this nice!)</li>
      <li>The original order was never received and 2 emails to the seller were never answered.  </li>
      <li>I was so excited.....</li>
      <li>my hair is about 25 inches long from root to tip and the longer feathers look very nice with my hair.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product! :)</li>
      <li>but these came fairly quick</li>
      <li>and i liked the feathers from the other brand more</li>
      <li>It arrived earlier than expected, which is great!</li>
      <li>I dont believe it was worth the money.</li>
      <li>and she rarely had problems.  </li>
      <li>they were long mixtures of different colored feathers and they are very good quality feathers.</li>
      <li>after fighting with my hair, and trying to put it in the right spot so that it showed i went out.</li>
      <li>They aren&#x27;t really full or super long, but for the price, you&#x27;re getting a really cute feather hair extension, neatly packaged with the two crimp beads as they advertised.  </li>
      <li>Can you say very very very dissapointed.</li>
      <li>&amp; I&#x27;d definitely buy from sexy sparkles again.</li>
      <li>I read the other posts before buying and thought it was a safe purchase, not so!</li>
      <li>I just recieved the extension .. and am not so happy with it, the feathers are extremely short not even 10 in long..</li>
      <li>They have actually stayed in my daughters hair much better than the $25 ones</li>
      <li>theyre simple and easy to use once you know what youre doing</li>
      <li>There were only one little feather in the package,the picture shows a whole bounch.wasn t too happy that it was one string</li>
      <li>I really do like the feathers</li>
      <li>When I recieved these feathers, I was absolutely stunned.</li>
      <li>I really dislike this product.</li>
      <li>it was fantastic quality, and the length was about 8 inches and the shortest was like 4 or 6 (but that was only one).</li>
      <li>Photo is very misleading, shows lots of feathers</li>
      <li>I am very disapointed.</li>
      <li>i ordered multiple extensions and the longest extension that i recieve is right around 14 or 15 inches long, which made me extremely happy because i have such long hair.</li>
      <li>, I believe this is an affordable way to get a high end hair salon look.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this feather extension.</li>
      <li>reason to pay high salon prices anymore.</li>
      <li>They must be running out of feathers because they were only 4 inches long and very cheap.....</li>
      <li>You can simply select the strand of hair you wish to put the feather bundle on, wet it and then twist it so the micro bead can easily slip onto the hair strand (about 1 cm from root.</li>
      <li>I did not know neon orange was a natural color?</li>
      <li>I dont understand why shipping cost so much when they shipped them in a regular stamped envelope.</li>
      <li>B0052G9LVG Natural Mix Feather Hair Extension]]    </li>
      <li>That was kind of frustrating.</li>
      <li>They were puffy and barely had stripes!!!</li>
      <li>the description says they can be a number of different lengths and the feathers i recieved were exactly that, a mixture of different lengths.</li>
      <li>I agree shipping is pretty high for just receiving a little cushioned envelope.</li>
      <li>Recieved these hair feathers and while they are pretty they were small and very costly.</li>
      <li>there were only 3 feathers not 5 as stated in the description and 2 were not even feathers decided to keep them as cost just as much to send them back</li>
      <li>I ordered mine first &amp; all the other girls I work with received</li>
      <li>For the record, you can put these feathers in yourself without the special beading kit (with the looping wire and small pliers), or a hair stylist.</li>
      <li>These came much faster than expected!</li>
      <li>I should&#x27;ve measured how much length it actually was because it was shorter than expected.</li>
      <li>The feathers are tough and dont disintegrate easily.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really dislike this product. It wasnt what i expected. The picture shown is nothing alike to how they come. They are really small, and barely notisable in the hair.</li>
    <li> It arrived earlier than expected, which is great! I wish I had known what I was going to get. I did not know neon orange was a natural color? I also expected them to be longer but that&#x27;s not a big deal. I really do like the feathers but I don&#x27;t think I will be using that one orange feather.</li>
    <li> I bought this feather this past July and it lasted about 5 months. During that time I received tons and tons of compliments! I highly recommend this feather extension. You&#x27;ll love it and others will too.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0052G9LVG Natural Mix Feather Hair Extension]]    My daughter bought this feather hair extension and once we FINALLY received the item, it was what she expected.  The original order was never received and 2 emails to the seller were never answered.  After filing a claim and writing a not so raving review about the seller, we received a phone call from the owner apologizing.  Seller didn&#x27;t understand why we never received it?  She sent it regular mail without any tracking.  She tried to explain how expensive it is to ship things and it was cheaper to send in the mail and she rarely had problems.  The item was re-sent using a tracking number and was received in good condition.  I believe that this is just a seller that has a popular item and is a bit overwhelmed by the amount of orders she is receiving.  The item itself was what was advertised.</li>
    <li> It took about 5-6 days to get this product.  When i received the feathers i was expecting longer feathers.  The ones i got were just under 4 inches.  I think there is a misunderstanding in the product description.  I am very disappoint in what i have gotten for a very very expensive price.  And the shipping was over priced for this little thing.  They should also come up with a different picture of the product because its not was i at all expected.  I will not be purchasing a product by this seller again.</li>
    <li> the pictuer is totally misleading overpriced!! only a few feathers are in the pack!! the picture shows tons of feathers. so not true. I am very disapointed. wrip off.</li>
    <li> Recieved these hair feathers and while they are pretty they were small and very costly. I was expecting alot more feathers then what I got for the price. TOO EXPENSIVE!!!!</li>
    <li> there were only 3 feathers not 5 as stated in the description and 2 were not even feathers decided to keep them as cost just as much to send them back just disappointed there was only one feather not 5 like the ad said and other 2 looked like pieces of hair</li>
    <li> Cute! Wish they were more noticeable. I should&#x27;ve measured how much length it actually was because it was shorter than expected. Love them though, wish I had more.</li>
    <li> Very very good quality and fast shipping. I have bought the real feathers and a few from others that are synthetic and the synthetic are worthless but the talk about how the birds are sacrificed for there feathers and anyone whom eats eggs or chickens even pet food that has chickens have no rite to criticize as the roosters are well cared for and quickly dispatched not treated badly as there counterparts are so speak up about animal crewlity  I DO and support your local havens for animals! Thank you Deniitall</li>
    <li> They aren&#x27;t really full or super long, but for the price, you&#x27;re getting a really cute feather hair extension, neatly packaged with the two crimp beads as they advertised.  Mine arrived pretty quickly and in perfect condition.  The feathers are in great condition.  I&#x27;m looking forward to wearing them for a while.</li>
    <li> i bought the same pack from a different brand and i liked the feathers from the other brand more but these came fairly quick</li>
    <li> i bought these extensions the other week and i must say i am very pleased. although i was wary due to the other reviews, i received this product in about 5 days after purchasing. the feathers were all about 8 inches and look like they do in the picture. you get about 5 feathes in a bundle and they go great with my brown hair. it took about 2 minutes to install. i simply put the feather and a few hairs through the bead and clamped it shut with some pliers. i am very happy with my purchase and i would recommend this to a friend:)</li>
    <li> This feathers were smaller than expected, the imagines of the product are misleading, the should have a comparative articule by their side so you will get a better information.</li>
    <li> I was so excited..... then they arrived!!! Can you say very very very dissapointed. They must be running out of feathers because they were only 4 inches long and very cheap..... my hair is atleast 12inches long. They were puffy and barely had stripes!!! Yikes, buyer beware. I read the other posts before buying and thought it was a safe purchase, not so! I will be returning them but I&#x27;m out of my shipping charges. I dont understand why shipping cost so much when they shipped them in a regular stamped envelope. I guess they&#x27;re one of those companies that know the product is not great so they make money off of shipping. Save your time and money.</li>
    <li> I just recieved the extension .. and am not so happy with it, the feathers are extremely short not even 10 in long.. and i have VERY long hair so I dont know how I could even put it in without it getting lost in my hair. I&#x27;m gonna try to see what the feathers look like in my hair but if im not happy with it I will be returning the extension ASAP! I dont believe it was worth the money.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product.  It looks just like what you buy in the salon.  i&#x27;d recommend this to everyone if you want to do them yourself and not pay someone.</li>
    <li> I got these feathers in about 2 weeks ago, they were amazing straight out of the package. it was fantastic quality, and the length was about 8 inches and the shortest was like 4 or 6 (but that was only one). i was very excited to put them in my hair. after fighting with my hair, and trying to put it in the right spot so that it showed i went out. NO ONE noticed it! so i do recommend if your hair is dark brown that this isnt the extension for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but i spoke with a woman that worked there, she helped out a TON! &amp; even told me that they&#x27;ll exchange it or give me a refund. lets just say im a proud owner of a Mermaid Feather Hair Extension that they provide! I LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FANTASTIC PRODUCT &amp; FANTASTIC CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!! WILL BUY AGAIN FROM HERE!!!!&lt;br /&gt;[:</li>
    <li> Considering that these feathers are over $25 in salons, I was very happy with these. They have actually stayed in my daughters hair much better than the $25 ones and they look GREAT!!</li>
    <li> These are even better than the ones at my salon.  Super easy to put in.  You don&#x27;t have to have the threading wire. I just slid the bead on a bobby pin.  They look great.</li>
    <li> My daughter saw these at the store, but they wanted over $15 to just put in one. I figured I would give it a try myself.&lt;br /&gt;These were excellent quality.  They were very easy to put it (there are online videos to show you if you can&#x27;t figure it out).&lt;br /&gt;No reason to pay high salon prices anymore.</li>
    <li> These came much faster than expected! They&#x27;re beautiful and so easy! I&#x27;m really pleased with them. I thought I wouldn&#x27;t like the fact that they&#x27;re joined together, but it made the process of putting them in and making sure they&#x27;re all facing the right way so easy! And they&#x27;re definitely arranged to my taste! I highly recommend this product! :)</li>
    <li> They are simple to put in yourself, and look great. My only complaint was that my purchase was a little on the short side, barely four inches. Also, one of the feathers in my bundle seemed exceptionally yellow. I just pulled it out, and had no problems otherwise. Next time I&#x27;ll have to order a longer extension.</li>
    <li> These got here very quickly and came with everything I needed to put them in! The feathers are tough and dont disintegrate easily. They seem to be tough and long lasting, I will be buying from again!</li>
    <li> Photo is very misleading, shows lots of feathers but you only receive 1 TINY piece with 5 extremely small and thin feathers.  Not worth the price at all, I would not have bought it if I had known.  Description of what you get was not beside the photo so I missed the ONE extention comment and didn&#x27;t read the reviews like I normally do, a very expensive lesson since I bought 2!</li>
    <li> i was extremely impressed with these feathers. they were long mixtures of different colored feathers and they are very good quality feathers. the description says they can be a number of different lengths and the feathers i recieved were exactly that, a mixture of different lengths. I LOVE THEM! some are very long and some are only about 4 inches long. my hair is about 25 inches long from root to tip and the longer feathers look very nice with my hair. i ordered multiple extensions and the longest extension that i recieve is right around 14 or 15 inches long, which made me extremely happy because i have such long hair. also, the colors of the feathers are gorgeous. some are solid colors and some are \\&quot;grizzly\\&quot; or striped. the feathers arrived in a timely manor and were in good shape upon arriving. i recommend these to anyone who is looking for good quality and good looking feather extentsions.</li>
    <li> I just use some eyelash glue to add these to my hair sometimes.</li>
    <li> These arrived fast and are just gorgeous.  I have brown hair with blonde hightlights so I can hide these easily if I want to.  LOVE!</li>
    <li> When I recieved these feathers, I was absolutely stunned. Each and every one of the feathers in the bundle was gorgeous! They were long, beautifully colored, and very high quality (including many of the popular grizzly feathers). Not only did the extension look beautiful, but it included two of the crimping beads for easy installation. For the record, you can put these feathers in yourself without the special beading kit (with the looping wire and small pliers), or a hair stylist. You can simply select the strand of hair you wish to put the feather bundle on, wet it and then twist it so the micro bead can easily slip onto the hair strand (about 1 cm from root. Then, insert the bundle into the bead, and use a simple pair of pliers to \\&quot;smoosh\\&quot; the bead down which allows the bundle to stay in place. You can also trim the top of the extension that may be sticking out from the top of the bead where your hair root is. Seeing as it can be 60 + dollars to get as little as 3 individual feathers to be installed (I had an individual feather installed at a salon and it was 30 dollars), I believe this is an affordable way to get a high end hair salon look. Happy shopping!</li>
    <li> The picture is misleading.  you think your get a bundle of feathers and instead they send you 5 strings of hair, so small and tiny.  i would NOT have paid 20.00 for this if i had known it was this little.  The colors are georgous but the amount of feathers are not worth the money, i totally got ripped off!</li>
    <li> these extentions do not come as long as expected; also the color and the picture is NOTHING like the actual product; the feathers do not straighten and curl as well as i expected; infact they go the opposite way of my hair. they also come with no instructions; and is NOT worth the money paid for it.</li>
    <li> Well I ordered these along with about 5 other girls at my hair salon. I ordered mine first &amp; all the other girls I work with received there&#x27;s before me. That was kind of frustrating. I agree shipping is pretty high for just receiving a little cushioned envelope. The extention itself is absolutely awesome. So in the end it was worth it for sure &amp; I&#x27;d definitely buy from sexy sparkles again. It&#x27;s a great seller, thank you</li>
    <li> i love these things. theyre simple and easy to use once you know what youre doing and they add just the perfect touch to your hair</li>
    <li> I loved the feathers but i hate that you guys put tape on them. It ruined my feathers and i couldn&#x27;t use them!</li>
    <li> product is very small and probbaly not worth the money, save yourself from buying the product you can probably get it for cheaper in a salon or at a craft store!</li>
    <li> The name is misleading. I thought i was getting 5 separate extensions. I guess $2 for one extension is ok but I paid $3 shipping for it to be packed in a bunch of peanuts? If it was only one it should have been sent in an envelope with a stamp. Unacceptable but not worth returning since the shipping wouldn&#x27;t be refunded.</li>
    <li> Not only are these feathers nice, but they arrived super fast and are about 1/4 of what the price is in a beauty supply store (not that I saw any in a store this nice!)</li>
    <li> There were only one little feather in the package,the picture shows a whole bounch.wasn t too happy that it was one string and it s nothing like the picture.Not loving it.</li>
