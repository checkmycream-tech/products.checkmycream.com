      <li>ITS AWESOME!!!!!!</li>
      <li>Best straighter I have ever had.</li>
      <li>The iron is wonderfully awesome, and arrived promptly, even though it was shipped across the pond.</li>
      <li>Works great on damp hair.</li>
      <li>I loved it until it stopped working.</li>
      <li>It does it&#x27;s job but isn&#x27;t as good as some others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>As another reviewer said, it takes a couple of passes to get a good result and my hair is not curly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had my own CHI ceramic iron for 6 or 7 years, and I loved it.</li>
      <li>but this gets hot and works great!</li>
      <li>and I was able to use my Discover Card rewards to pay for it!</li>
      <li>but I must say, this product is amazing.  </li>
      <li>but it was so effective on my hair and my daughter&#x27;s (even longer hair) that I bought one for each of us.  </li>
      <li>that is ok.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m able to get results like my stylist does and it lasts for days.</li>
      <li>So glad I upgraded.</li>

      <li>Price was right and I am super happy with the results.</li>
      <li>I loved that straightener it would leave my hair so straight and smooth!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many straighteners and was excited about this one.</li>
      <li>Easy to use.  </li>
      <li>Straightens fine, but rips my hair.  </li>
      <li>Love how quickly it heats up.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s important to note that this is not a \\&quot;professional\\&quot; heat tool.</li>
      <li>I used Chi silky serum which I think helped, but this iron was fantastic.  </li>
      <li>It does seem to work ok, and it is probably worth what I paid.</li>
      <li>This product isn&#x27;t delivered fit for use in the UK.  </li>
      <li>Most irons, including an old wet-2-dry iron I had fried my hair the more I used it, not this one.  </li>
      <li>works great on dry hair dont like that</li>
      <li>I would suggest if you have naturally curly hair to continue to research and find a better product!</li>
      <li>However, she is very dissapointed thinking it isnt the authentic one.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair shiny and straight and healthy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had this brand product before and am very satisfied with performance, little adjustment to using a larger size but works great</li>
      <li>had a girlfriend show me exactly how to straighten my hair without straightening my ears!</li>
      <li>I wasnt willing to spend $150 on one and was excited to see this on Amazon.</li>
      <li>My hair is quite fine but very wavy.</li>
      <li>Well worth the money.</li>
      <li>But I personally have had better results from a cheap grocery store tool than from this one.</li>
      <li>I have very curly hair and this flat iron works like magic!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t get very hot and it takes 3-4 times over one section to get it straight</li>
      <li>My sister had recently purchased a Royale Flat Iron at the mall (for $150) and called to tell me how great it was.</li>
      <li>Actually made my hair smoother and silkier the more I used it.  </li>
      <li>And obviously some people have enjoyed it</li>
      <li>this straightener really didn&#x27;t straighten like I was hoping it would!</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t get it completely straight!</li>
      <li>My wife loves this hair straightener, saves her time being able to use it on wet hair and it heats up quickly</li>
      <li>(I bought it because the reviews were pretty positive).</li>
      <li>A friend of mine back in the states (currently in Germany) told me about this iron and how she loved it.</li>
      <li>At first I was really upset because it was not the tourmaline style as listed.</li>
      <li>At first I was upset and didn&#x27;t really want to participate</li>
      <li>While it does do a pretty nice job if some hair is still a little damp on drying it out</li>
      <li>My hair went from dry and frizzy to silky and smooth!  </li>
      <li>The chi has a curved side which works really well for the waves.</li>
      <li>But delivery was fast.</li>
      <li>However, immediately she noticed that the plates dont light up red like the one at the mall did.</li>
      <li>I just want to give some real feedback here because reading what feedback was already on here</li>
      <li>Just say what it really is.</li>
      <li>Like freaky fast.</li>
      <li>to scratch the &amp;#34;ceranic&amp;#34; plates, and you  will see yourself that they are made from real steel.</li>
      <li>This device seems to only be good for wet hair also.</li>
      <li>I had tried a royal flat iron in an Orlando mall, it made my hair feel smooth and silky.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been going the cheap route with an average silk product, but I&#x27;ve discovered that while I can still use it when styling wet, using a higher grade silk works a lot better, in addition to protecting my hair.    </li>
      <li>Before this purchase I just had a regular (and I can&#x27;t think of the brand right now) straightener that you could purchase anywhere!</li>
      <li>However, my tresses never stood a chance against the single heat setting (lava hot!!)</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;d rather spend a little more time on my style than fry my locks.</li>
      <li>but as I had to pay an extra £13 to retrieve the item from Royal Mail I decided it wasn&#x27;t worth the postage cost for the return.  </li>
      <li>Leaves my hair feeling very soft too.</li>
      <li>Does work very well especially with wet hair dries it quickly</li>
      <li>At the firs moment the hair straightener looked little cheap to me when I unboxed it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried using it when my hair was wet and dry, and while both results were fantastic, styling my wet hair actually looks better.</li>
      <li>This is my third flat iron purchase and a much superior product than my two previous big box store purchases.</li>
      <li>Make my hair so soft.</li>
      <li>The one I purchased on Amazon, although I like it, is nowhere near the quality of the one I tried at the mall.</li>
      <li>As a person with naturally curly hair</li>
      <li>I use it every day and my hair looks fabulous in less than 5 minutes!</li>
      <li>I will say that it straightens quickly and the wet to dry feature did work for me on damp hair.</li>
      <li>The paddle itself is two inches, but the ceramic plates (completely ceramic, not plated) are only 1.75\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been a die-hard CHI fan for about 8 years, going so far as to only go to salons that used CHI products.</li>
      <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t really like is that it&#x27;s harder to do waves/curls with this vs my chi.</li>
      <li>I should have known from the first time I used it as it left my hair limp and brittle feeling after even just one use.</li>

<li> I thought it over, skeptical of both a different brand and an iron that claims to go from wet to dry, but my friend said she would buy me a CHI if I didn&#x27;t love this product.    </li>
<li> but when i tried it, i couldn&#x27;t believe how fast it straightened my hair which is not easy to style it at all!</li>
<li> I feel like it takes twice as long to straighten my hair-</li>
<li> How did I not know about wet hair flat irons?!</li>
<li> But in the beginning I was using the wet to dry feature and figured that on just dry hair</li>
<li> That&#x27;d probably not really do anything.</li>
<li> I have a lot of medium size hair which seems to get caught in the metal clamp when I&#x27;m ironing my wet hair.  </li>
<li> , you can use it on wet hair.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s thick with a lot of texture and I use professional quality products to protect and strengthen it.</li>
<li> I never blow dry my hair to complete dryness, which prevented me from straightening my weird fuzzball in the back of my hair.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t use this on very wet hair.</li>
<li> Maybe if it had a few more heat settings it wouldn&#x27;t be so bad.</li>
<li> not worth it.</li>
<li> It takes a lot less time because I just need to run it down each section once and its done.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is either on or off. No heat controls. I will use it for travel but I bought a different one.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the fact it only turns on- no settings- I feel like it takes twice as long to straighten my hair- but it does so that is ok.</li>
    <li> Actually made my hair smoother and silkier the more I used it.  Most irons, including an old wet-2-dry iron I had fried my hair the more I used it, not this one.  I used Chi silky serum which I think helped, but this iron was fantastic.  I would recommend to friends!</li>
    <li> At the firs moment the hair straightener looked little cheap to me when I unboxed it but when i tried it, i couldn&#x27;t believe how fast it straightened my hair which is not easy to style it at all! Deffenately would recommend it to everyone.  Thank you,   Petya</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a die-hard CHI fan for about 8 years, going so far as to only go to salons that used CHI products. I&#x27;ve had my own CHI ceramic iron for 6 or 7 years, and I loved it. Unfortunately, it died on me, and I&#x27;ve been looking for a flat iron for months. I wanted another CHI, but couldn&#x27;t find anything with a larger paddle than 1\\&quot;. A friend of mine back in the states (currently in Germany) told me about this iron and how she loved it. I thought it over, skeptical of both a different brand and an iron that claims to go from wet to dry, but my friend said she would buy me a CHI if I didn&#x27;t love this product.    It&#x27;s been two months since I got it, and am now a die-hard fan of this product. I can&#x27;t believe how well it works. I&#x27;ve tried using it when my hair was wet and dry, and while both results were fantastic, styling my wet hair actually looks better. I&#x27;ve been going the cheap route with an average silk product, but I&#x27;ve discovered that while I can still use it when styling wet, using a higher grade silk works a lot better, in addition to protecting my hair.    The only thing misleading about the advertisement is 2\\&quot; width. The paddle itself is two inches, but the ceramic plates (completely ceramic, not plated) are only 1.75\\&quot;. While I was slightly disappointed about the quarter inch discrepency, I got over it quickly, especially upon the realization that 2\\&quot; ceramic plates would result in a bigger, bulky handle.    The iron is wonderfully awesome, and arrived promptly, even though it was shipped across the pond.</li>
    <li> I bought this product while visiting the Florida Mall in Orlando. My daughter volunteered us to try this hair straightener when solicited by someone at a kiosk.  At first I was upset and didn&#x27;t really want to participate but I must say, this product is amazing.  I felt like I was in a before and after commercial.  My hair went from dry and frizzy to silky and smooth!  Easy to use.  You will love the results.  Even the humidity will not reverse the job once you&#x27;ve straightened your hair.  I never buy pricey stuff like this but it was so effective on my hair and my daughter&#x27;s (even longer hair) that I bought one for each of us.  I have not regretted my decision.  I use it every day and my hair looks fabulous in less than 5 minutes!</li>
    <li> This product isn&#x27;t delivered fit for use in the UK.  It has a two pin plug so you will need an adapter.  I would have returned the product but as I had to pay an extra £13 to retrieve the item from Royal Mail I decided it wasn&#x27;t worth the postage cost for the return.  It will remain in the box until I can get an adapter.</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair and this flat iron works like magic! I had never used one before, so had a girlfriend show me exactly how to straighten my hair without straightening my ears!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this brand product before and am very satisfied with performance, little adjustment to using a larger size but works great</li>
    <li> This is so awesome! How did I not know about wet hair flat irons?! I never blow dry my hair to complete dryness, which prevented me from straightening my weird fuzzball in the back of my hair. I don&#x27;t use this on very wet hair. That&#x27;d probably not really do anything. Works great on damp hair. Also, whenever I do use this, I get compliments on how shiny my hair is. The only thing I don&#x27;t really like is that it&#x27;s harder to do waves/curls with this vs my chi. The chi has a curved side which works really well for the waves.</li>
    <li> Dries your hair but leaves it frizzy and you have to use regular flat iron to style....double process, so not worth it.</li>
    <li> I had tried a royal flat iron in an Orlando mall, it made my hair feel smooth and silky. The one I purchased on Amazon, although I like it, is nowhere near the quality of the one I tried at the mall.</li>
    <li> Does work very well especially with wet hair dries it quickly no hair drier required got two of them to give away.</li>
    <li> works great on dry hair dont like that you have no control of heat but this gets hot and works great!</li>
    <li> Metal plates covered with paint!!!&lt;br /&gt;Try to scratch the &amp;#34;ceranic&amp;#34; plates, and you  will see yourself that they are made from real steel.</li>
    <li> This royale straightener is anything but royale. I should of went with the Chi. Heck, my Remington was better than this straightener. It doesn&#x27;t get very hot and it takes 3-4 times over one section to get it straight and my hairs not even curly. I will but be buying a royale product again.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this hair straightener, saves her time being able to use it on wet hair and it heats up quickly she thinks it is the best product on the market.</li>
    <li> THE BEST FLAT IRON IVE EVER OWNED... WORKS WELL ON MY THICK CURLY ETHNIC HAIR.  AND NO MORE BLOW DRYING.  DRIES AS IT FLATTENS... ITS AWESOME!!!!!!</li>
    <li> My sister had recently purchased a Royale Flat Iron at the mall (for $150) and called to tell me how great it was. I decided to check to see if I could find a similar one on Amazon. It was considerably less than she paid and I was able to use my Discover Card rewards to pay for it! This is my third flat iron purchase and a much superior product than my two previous big box store purchases. I&#x27;m able to get results like my stylist does and it lasts for days.My hair is quite fine but very wavy. It takes a lot less time because I just need to run it down each section once and its done. Leaves my hair feeling very soft too. So glad I upgraded.</li>
    <li> I loved it until it stopped working. I havent even had it a year...  Disappointed</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair shiny and straight and healthy. Love how quickly it heats up. Doesn&#x27;t pull or break my hair., you can use it on wet hair.</li>
    <li> My daughter wanted one of these from the mall horribly. I wasnt willing to spend $150 on one and was excited to see this on Amazon. However, immediately she noticed that the plates dont light up red like the one at the mall did. It does seem to work ok, and it is probably worth what I paid. However, she is very dissapointed thinking it isnt the authentic one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many straighteners and was excited about this one. It does it&#x27;s job but isn&#x27;t as good as some others I&#x27;ve tried. As another reviewer said, it takes a couple of passes to get a good result and my hair is not curly.</li>
    <li> I did not like it. It did not heat up enough to straighten and it has a crackle noise when heating up. I need to return the product.</li>
    <li> At first I was really upset because it was not the tourmaline style as listed. This has metal plates and only heats to 250. I was going to return it but a friend wanted it. Just say what it really is.</li>
    <li> Straightens fine, but rips my hair.  I have a lot of medium size hair which seems to get caught in the metal clamp when I&#x27;m ironing my wet hair.  This device seems to only be good for wet hair also.</li>
    <li> I was leary about buying a product for my hair online. But delivery was fast. Like freaky fast. Price was right and I am super happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I am really disappointed in the condition this flat iron has left my hair in after just a few weeks of use. I don&#x27;t consider my hair to be fragile. It&#x27;s thick with a lot of texture and I use professional quality products to protect and strengthen it. However, my tresses never stood a chance against the single heat setting (lava hot!!) on this tool. I should have known from the first time I used it as it left my hair limp and brittle feeling after even just one use. But in the beginning I was using the wet to dry feature and figured that on just dry hair it probably wouldn&#x27;t be so bad. Unfortunately, it continued to ruin my hair even when using it on dry so I had to discontinue use. It&#x27;s important to note that this is not a \\&quot;professional\\&quot; heat tool. Your hair stylist wouldn&#x27;t use Royale. It&#x27;s actually a brand of straightener that&#x27;s sold at the mall by pushy salespeople without a cosmetology license. I will say that it straightens quickly and the wet to dry feature did work for me on damp hair. But I&#x27;d rather spend a little more time on my style than fry my locks. Maybe if it had a few more heat settings it wouldn&#x27;t be so bad. And obviously some people have enjoyed it (I bought it because the reviews were pretty positive). But I personally have had better results from a cheap grocery store tool than from this one.</li>
    <li> Best straighter I have ever had. Make my hair so soft. I was offered this on vacation for 225 dollars and bought it on here for so much less. I had a chi and this was 10x better. Well worth the money. I love it.</li>
    <li> I just want to give some real feedback here because reading what feedback was already on here I feel like I was fooled!  While this straightener is okay, it&#x27;s not great! As a person with naturally curly hair this straightener really didn&#x27;t straighten like I was hoping it would! Before this purchase I just had a regular (and I can&#x27;t think of the brand right now) straightener that you could purchase anywhere! I loved that straightener it would leave my hair so straight and smooth! This one, well my hair is still wavy! Couldn&#x27;t get it completely straight! While it does do a pretty nice job if some hair is still a little damp on drying it out it&#x27;s just not what it seems! I would suggest if you have naturally curly hair to continue to research and find a better product!</li>
