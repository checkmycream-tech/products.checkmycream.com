<li> I use this with Mineral Veil for a little glow.</li>
<li> I have been using it for a few years now.</li>
<li> Hard to match color to skintone.</li>
<li> And I have tried the other cheaper brands of mineral makeups, NO GOOD!!</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve bought this from other sellers at a cheaper price and the foundation was horrible, clearly a knock-off brand.</li>
<li> The Medium shade is a blue base, not a golden base.  </li>

    <li> Love all bare minerals products.  My skin has never been better</li>
    <li> The best foundation ever!</li>
    <li> Hard to match color to skintone.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have been using it for a few years now. It gas great coverage. I recommend.</li>
    <li> Used this for years and nothing else can compare.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using bare minerals for few years now and I love it. It makes my face glow.</li>
    <li> I have used Bare Minerals for several years now.  I appreciate the opportunity and convenience of buying it on line.</li>
    <li> I always love this stuff. A perfect cover-up</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and this has been my foundation of choice for 5 years.  I have tried new oil control foundations from drug store to department store to boutique.  But I always go back to bare minerals.</li>
    <li> I have large pours so was looking for something that could help hide them.  This MATTE by bareMinerals does the job.  At first when I applied it I thought it only showed them more; but added a little more to the brush and did the swirling application and it hid what I was concerned with.  After that I&#x27;ve been making sure I put on enough to hide the flaws on my face.  The fact that I put it on in the morning and only need to reapply for evening is awesome and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing a mask.  Be sure and use the  primer by bareminerals...I put on moisturizer let it soak in and then the primer before adding the foundation.  My aging skin is fickle and can be dry one minute and oily a half hour later but this foundation seems to even out this problem for me.  Even when I sweat in Maui my skin looked great.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite makeup!  Believe me I have tried a lot of different makeups and I always come back to this one!</li>
    <li> Excellent, great product .</li>
    <li> This is my favorite and ONLY foundation.  I&#x27;ve tried other &amp;#34;mineral&amp;#34; foundations and there is no comparison!</li>

    <li> This is the real deal. I&#x27;ve bought this from other sellers at a cheaper price and the foundation was horrible, clearly a knock-off brand. But this stuff is the real BareMinerals. It&#x27;s wonderful to use everyday under your other makeup, or alone for sunscreen protection only, as well. It came in the mail fast and I&#x27;ll continue to purchase from this seller in the future. A+++ Highly recommended! Thank you !</li>
    <li> Goes on easily and always looks good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a bare minerals fan for life!! the best foundation ever, nothing compares. yeah ,it&#x27;s pricey, but you get what you pay for . And I have tried the other cheaper brands of mineral makeups, NO GOOD!! I even sleep in it once in awhile because I forget I&#x27;m wearing makeup!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s even improved my skin&#x27;s natural appearance since I&#x27;ve been using it.And there are even some other brands out there that are more expensive than Bare Minerals, and actually I think on amazon I have found it the cheapest place to buy it from. Thank you Amazon!!</li>
    <li> The Medium shade is a blue base, not a golden base.  Best for cool, not warm, colored skin.&lt;br /&gt;Messy to apply, but I just lay out a wash cloth.  If I get any on my clothes, one of those miracle cloths that they make for cleaning picks it right off. Stays on longer than any other foundation I&#x27;ve tried.  Definitely needs a moisturizer - otherwise, it won&#x27;t last.  I use this with Mineral Veil for a little glow.</li>
    <li> Just like I&#x27;ve been ordering directly from Bare Essentials.  A wonderful product I can depend on every time.</li>
    <li> I love bare minerals makeup.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and delivery was speedy!</li>
