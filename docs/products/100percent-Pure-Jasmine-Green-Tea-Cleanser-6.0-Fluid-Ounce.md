### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This product is perfect.  </li>
      <li>The cleanser smelled great too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This cleanser is great not drying on the skin.</li>
      <li>All around good.</li>
      <li>I also love the toner &amp; moisturizer!</li>
      <li>Amazing product line.</li>
      <li>100% Pure is the best - love all their products.  </li>
      <li>The scent is mild and pleasant.  </li>
      <li>Both are foam cleansers, therefore are very light.</li>
      <li>The problem is that the foam to me is mostly air and the product itself doesn&#x27;t feel as though it&#x27;s cleansing my skin.  </li>
      <li>It rinses off easily.  </li>
      <li>It is gentle on my sensitive skin and smells great too!</li>
      <li>My face feels smooth after using.</li>
      <li>I was amazed at how clean and fresh my skin looked and felt as well as how healthy it made it look.  </li>
      <li>Definitely worth it!</li>
      <li>great on my dry skin</li>
      <li>It foams up well &amp; my face feels clean.</li>
      <li>I am so glad I found 100% Pure products.  </li>
      <li>so clean and fresh smell.</li>
      <li>I am now a true believe in 100% Pure!</li>
      <li>a great cleanser, pure, natural and a natural alternative to all the &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34; out there that are so unhealthy...happy with purchase</li>
      <li>I switched to all natural face products and love this wash.</li>
      <li>I do like the scent of the Brightening cleanser as it is a fresh lemon smell.</li>
      <li>I like the lavender honey cleanser far better.</li>
      <li>so I had to buy it more frequently.</li>
      <li>Scent is light and leaves skin soft and clean.</li>
      <li>The foamer pump delivers the right amount to cleanse the face.  </li>
      <li>When you press down on the top, the product automatically foams which I thought was interesting.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t liked a cleanser this much in a long time!</li>
      <li>Try it and you&#x27;ll be a 100% pure girl too!</li>
      <li>Although I&#x27;m sure the ingredients are great, the way it leaves your face leaves a lot left to be desired as it sucks the moisture right out of your skin in my experience.</li>
      <li>This cleanser left my face feeling and looking even better than the Aveeno face washes.  </li>
      <li>favorite facial cleanser</li>
      <li>My skin feels soft and clean.</li>
      <li>This was my first introduction to 100% Pure products as I had never heard of them before.  </li>
      <li>However, my previous products have all been $30+ cleansers (Skinceuticals, Epicuren, and Jan Marini), so the price point for these are nice</li>
      <li>I bought this cleanser as well as the 100% Pure Brightening Cleanser with a lemon scent.</li>
      <li>switching from Aveeno&#x27;s acne cleanser to 100% Pure didn&#x27;t prove fatal as the 100% Pure regimen continued to keep my acne at bay.  </li>
      <li>I like 100% Pure products.  </li>
      <li>Being that it is all natural it even removes the toughest makeup, which is a plus :)  If you have sensitive skin like mine and or just looking into the all natural products...I highly recommend 100% pure!</li>
      <li>In fact, I don&#x27;t feel that it&#x27;s doing much of anything at all.  </li>
      <li>I like how gentle it is on my face.</li>
      <li>sensitive skin, but never a problem with this product, worth the dough.</li>
      <li>This product uses safe chemicals, which is really important to me, but it feels like a regular soap when you use it (the skin is left feeling dry).</li>
      <li>and this face wash seemed to leave my face very dry like the effect of cheap soaps.</li>
      <li>I have normal to oily skin</li>
      <li>I normally have combo/hormonal skin.</li>
      <li>In fact, it&#x27;s less effective at removing make up than the regular soap.</li>
      <li>However, I am very sensitive to perfumes, preservatives, chemicals and dyes.  </li>
      <li>Completely messed up my skin...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars just because the ingredients were natural and non-irritating.</li>
      <li>All natural ingredients.  </li>
      <li>I use that one in the morning and green tea in the evening, however the green tea cleanser does have a sort of cardboard smelling undertone, not super strong, but not the clean fresh green tea scent I was hoping for.</li>
      <li>I am in my 50&#x27;s with skin type normal (not too dry, not oily).  </li>
      <li>I received the 100% Pure Jasmine Green Tea skin care gift set from my sister for Christmas.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Takes off makeup and doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel dry. My face feels smooth after using. I had very dry skin in the winter and this was the only cleanser that would take off my makeup AND kept the flakes at bay. I normally have combo/hormonal skin. I have used this with an electric face brush as well. All around good. I haven&#x27;t liked a cleanser this much in a long time!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t foam as advertized. I like the lavender honey cleanser far better.</li>
    <li> I am in my 50&#x27;s with skin type normal (not too dry, not oily).  However, I am very sensitive to perfumes, preservatives, chemicals and dyes.  This product is perfect.  All natural ingredients.  The scent is mild and pleasant.  The foamer pump delivers the right amount to cleanse the face.  It rinses off easily.  My skin feels soft and clean.</li>
    <li> Not a fan of the products</li>
    <li> I started off by using this every day in the shower. Then my husband started using it so I had to buy it more frequently. And then my daughter starting using it. I&#x27;m going through this stuff like mad! A 6oz bottle lasts the three of us about a month. I also love the toner &amp; moisturizer!</li>
    <li> favorite facial cleanser</li>
    <li> I bought this cleanser as well as the 100% Pure Brightening Cleanser with a lemon scent. Both are foam cleansers, therefore are very light. I have oily, acne-prone skin and I would say my skin is about the same or a bit clearer with these cleansers. However, my previous products have all been $30+ cleansers (Skinceuticals, Epicuren, and Jan Marini), so the price point for these are nice and I still use serums from other companies. I do like the scent of the Brightening cleanser as it is a fresh lemon smell. I use that one in the morning and green tea in the evening, however the green tea cleanser does have a sort of cardboard smelling undertone, not super strong, but not the clean fresh green tea scent I was hoping for. All in all, I would probably buy the Brightening cleanser and not the green tea cleanser based on the smell.</li>
    <li> so clean and fresh smell. great on my dry skin</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like using detergent in your face! Completely messed up my skin... I started breaking out w itchy skin like crazy!</li>
    <li> 100% Pure is the best - love all their products.  This cleanser is great not drying on the skin. Try it and you&#x27;ll be a 100% pure girl too!</li>
    <li> I switched to all natural face products and love this wash. It is gentle on my sensitive skin and smells great too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this with the moisturizer on my face for a week now and have no complaints. I switched to this from Aveeno to get away from chemicals in drugstore brands. Definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> I like 100% Pure products.  I have several of their skin creams.  But I didn&#x27;t like this cleansing foam.  When you press down on the top, the product automatically foams which I thought was interesting.  There was no need to work up a lather.  The problem is that the foam to me is mostly air and the product itself doesn&#x27;t feel as though it&#x27;s cleansing my skin.  In fact, I don&#x27;t feel that it&#x27;s doing much of anything at all.  I stopped using it and switched to another organic/natural type of cleanser from Earth Science.  I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars just because the ingredients were natural and non-irritating.</li>
    <li> This product uses safe chemicals, which is really important to me, but it feels like a regular soap when you use it (the skin is left feeling dry). In fact, it&#x27;s less effective at removing make up than the regular soap. I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> wife loves this. sensitive skin, but never a problem with this product, worth the dough.</li>
    <li> It may be something I reacted to in the product, but this dried my already dry skin out even worse.</li>
    <li> I received the 100% Pure Jasmine Green Tea skin care gift set from my sister for Christmas.  This was my first introduction to 100% Pure products as I had never heard of them before.  So I put aside my usual Aveeno skin care products and began immediately using 100% Pure to test it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Included was the Jasmine Green Tea Foaming Cleanser. I was amazed at how clean and fresh my skin looked and felt as well as how healthy it made it look.  It didn&#x27;t strip my skin nor did it leave any residue. The cleanser smelled great too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have acne prone skin but switching from Aveeno&#x27;s acne cleanser to 100% Pure didn&#x27;t prove fatal as the 100% Pure regimen continued to keep my acne at bay.

    <li> Amazing product line. I will never use another brand again.  Scent is light and leaves skin soft and clean.</li>
    <li> I like how gentle it is on my face. It foams up well &amp; my face feels clean.</li>
    <li> I have normal to oily skin and this face wash seemed to leave my face very dry like the effect of cheap soaps.
