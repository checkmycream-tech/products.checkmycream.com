      <li>It&#x27;s just okay.</li>
      <li>My mom was in love with Flowerbomb from the moment she smelled it one day in Sephora.</li>
      <li>I like Billionaire Boyfriend better.  </li>
      <li>this has been my favorite perfume for quite some time now, but paying</li>
      <li>and I simply love the scent..</li>
      <li>Love the fragrance.</li>
      <li>Love the smell but overpriced</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s what is important!</li>
      <li>need I say more?</li>
      <li>I am now in love with the scent.</li>
      <li>This was her choice of a Christmas gift and it is her favorite and at that time of year it is not something you buy for yourself.</li>
      <li>One of my favorites for sure.</li>
      <li>Different in a way that is wonderful.</li>
      <li>Excellent product other than it doesn&#x27;t stick well to your skin.</li>
      <li>it didn&#x27;t smell as strong as the one I bought from the store.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t normally wear perfume, but I got this as a gift, and I love the smell!</li>
      <li>Not sure why, I just wasnt as impressed as Bill.</li>
      <li>The package came on time and if looked like the original.</li>
      <li>Love the real thing, however this is not!</li>
      <li>It is a fragrance that will get you positive attention and lovely compliments .</li>
      <li>Fragrance preference is a personal matter, but if you enjoy this fragrance, you&#x27;ll be very satisfied with this supplier.</li>
      <li>the name says it does have a sweet smell but a sweet flower smell.</li>
      <li>My favorite YouTube guru raved about it so much I gave in and bought it.</li>
      <li>love it so much.  </li>
      <li>She puts it on and if evaporates quickly.</li>
      <li>My husband is in love with this new scent and friends keeps asking for the name of this fab product.</li>
      <li>and I think everyone has their own personal preferences.</li>
      <li>The fragrance from the bottle I received from Amazon smells NOTHING like my original bottle and has a sour, cheap smell even though I paid almost $100 for it!!</li>
      <li>I really like it, the other perfumes I like are cool waters, Versace Bright Crystal, burberry.</li>
      <li>I went and bought the real stuff, paid $40 more and am much happier with the real scent.</li>
      <li>You need to try it first and then decide on the purchase.</li>
      <li>I first got this as a gift.</li>
      <li>Even if you ordered this counterfeit Flowerbomb and liked the scent, be careful!</li>
      <li>;I still like the smell of the knock off, but will not be buying it from Amazon anymore; I will spend the extra money on the original, most likely at Sephora since I shop there often.</li>
      <li>nearly $100  bottle wasnt worth it to me.</li>
      <li>After noticing the tampering with the box, and reading the online reviews, I was convinced this product was not the real thing.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not the real thing</li>
      <li>The scent is NOT The same as the original FLOWER BOMB I ordered from Neiman Marcus.</li>
      <li>I was so excited when I received it in time for my big party!!</li>
      <li>I have used Flowerbomb for over a year now and have bought several full priced bottles.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have much luck with perfume because I&#x27;m terribly sensitive to scents and chemicals.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to get a larger bottle for her, so I ordered this one thinking it was a better bargain than going to Sephora and paying almost double this price for the same size.</li>
      <li>and I did compare with the new one</li>
      <li>Unfortunately I live out of the US -</li>
      <li>I got a smaller version of this perfume from my friend on my last birthday, so I was familiar with the fragrance.&lt;br</li>
      <li>When she opened the package and sprayed this perfume, the scent was nice--but it was nothing like the actual scent of the real Flowerbomb.</li>
      <li>Knock off perfumes tend to contain very harmful ingredients that can cause rashes and such, even for people who don&#x27;t have &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Scent doesn&#x27;t last and bottle is different from the real stuff.</li>
      <li>After realizing the difference, we did some detective work and realized that not only was the scent totally off, but the bottle and packaging were totally incorrect from the real thing.</li>
      <li>Romantic, musky, strong but subtle scent.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The package came on time and if looked like the original. My wife says it&#x27;s not real perfume. She puts it on and if evaporates quickly. She has bought the same perfume from Macys and it last longer when sprayed on.</li>
    <li> There were areas that appear to have been labels on the inside of the box that were cut out. After noticing the tampering with the box, and reading the online reviews, I was convinced this product was not the real thing.</li>
    <li> FLOWERBOMB is the best perfume I tried in my life.</li>
    <li> This is fake. Unfortunately I live out of the US - someone bought it for me - and I can&#x27;t exchange it. I even had some left from one that I got at a store and I did compare with the new one and it smells different. I do not recommend it.</li>
    <li> Product was delivered when expected.  Smells good.</li>
    <li> Gift...we&#x27;ll see if she likes...that&#x27;s what is important!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so sorry for those of you who purchased this perfume and were duped. I&#x27;m not one of them. I purchased an authentic bottle from beauty encounters! It smells so great OMG! I&#x27;m in love! My favorite YouTube guru raved about it so much I gave in and bought it. The 1.7 is a rather big bottle but next time I will purchase the bigger bottle! I love this fragrance!!</li>
    <li> Fragrance preference is a personal matter, but if you enjoy this fragrance, you&#x27;ll be very satisfied with this supplier.</li>
    <li> Excellent product other than it doesn&#x27;t stick well to your skin.</li>
    <li> Love the smell but overpriced</li>
    <li> My husband is in love with this new scent and friends keeps asking for the name of this fab product.</li>
    <li> love it so much.  Left it on vacation.  Waaaaaa!</li>
    <li> This appears to be a knock off. Scent doesn&#x27;t last and bottle is different from the real stuff. I went and bought the real stuff, paid $40 more and am much happier with the real scent. Will not order from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally wear perfume, but I got this as a gift, and I love the smell! It&#x27;s not too strong but smells remarkable! I have finally form a perfume I can use!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have much luck with perfume because I&#x27;m terribly sensitive to scents and chemicals. Flowerbomb doesn&#x27;t affect me that way and I simply love the scent.. But this is me and I think everyone has their own personal preferences. Perfume can smell totally wonderful on one friend and horrible on me. You need to try it first and then decide on the purchase. I tried a small purse size roll-on with an attached lip gloss before buying the large bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My concern is that the package had been opened and the code that Viktor and Rolf use to give you points was gone. I wonder if this was a one time incident or if the supplier Amazon was fulfilling for had taken all of the codes. Who knows?</li>
    <li> I first got this as a gift. I am now in love with the scent. Romantic, musky, strong but subtle scent. One of my favorites for sure. Great for date nights!</li>
    <li> I got a smaller version of this perfume from my friend on my last birthday, so I was familiar with the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;As the name says it does have a sweet smell but a sweet flower smell. I really like it, the other perfumes I like are cool waters, Versace Bright Crystal, burberry. I hope you will get an idea of my taste in perfume.</li>
    <li> The scent is NOT The same as the original FLOWER BOMB I ordered from Neiman Marcus. Since I ran out I ordered it from here and it is NOT the same. I didn&#x27;t think these scents varied.</li>
    <li> So different from any thing that I have smelled or put on. Different in a way that is wonderful. Thank You</li>
    <li> not the scent I had been saving.... smells different</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance. The packaging was missing the codes, it looks like they had been cut out. Not sure if this was Amazon&#x27;s doing or the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12/01/13: I&#x27;m updating my earlier review. After reading other reviews that this was a knock off, I went to Sephora and compared it; the packaging and smell are definitely different and the smell of this perfume doesn&#x27;t last as long as others that I also wear. ;I still like the smell of the knock off, but will not be buying it from Amazon anymore; I will spend the extra money on the original, most likely at Sephora since I shop there often.</li>
    <li> Love the real thing, however this is not! I purchased from soap.com and the scent doesn&#x27;t stay. Super frustrated and they refuse to accept return. DO NOT BUY</li>
    <li> DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT, IT&#x27;S FAKE. My mom was in love with Flowerbomb from the moment she smelled it one day in Sephora. Since then, she has kept very small bottles of it (samples) in the house, and I smell it ALL the time. I really wanted to get a larger bottle for her, so I ordered this one thinking it was a better bargain than going to Sephora and paying almost double this price for the same size. Boy, was I wrong. When she opened the package and sprayed this perfume, the scent was nice--but it was nothing like the actual scent of the real Flowerbomb. After realizing the difference, we did some detective work and realized that not only was the scent totally off, but the bottle and packaging were totally incorrect from the real thing. Everything about this product is fake. Even if you ordered this counterfeit Flowerbomb and liked the scent, be careful! Knock off perfumes tend to contain very harmful ingredients that can cause rashes and such, even for people who don&#x27;t have &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34;. I hope this helps.</li>
    <li> This was her choice of a Christmas gift and it is her favorite and at that time of year it is not something you buy for yourself.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it--need I say more?</li>
    <li> If I could give this product a 0 star rating I would... I have used Flowerbomb for over a year now and have bought several full priced bottles. I had a little bit left when, in an attempt to save a few extra bucks, i ordered this product from Amazon. The fragrance from the bottle I received from Amazon smells NOTHING like my original bottle and has a sour, cheap smell even though I paid almost $100 for it!! EXTREME RIP OFF!! I am horrified that I just wasted so much money... Will not ever purchase again.</li>
    <li> Very good..my fiancee loved it!!!</li>
    <li> it didn&#x27;t smell as strong as the one I bought from the store. Doesn&#x27;t stay as long on your skin. I will not buy  anymore perfume from Amazon.</li>
    <li> If you want a signature perfume...this is it!  It is a fragrance that will get you positive attention and lovely compliments .</li>
    <li> this has been my favorite perfume for quite some time now, but paying nearly $100  bottle wasnt worth it to me. This is the best bargain ever and i WILL continue to support your store :) the packaging was great, everything was as if bought in store myself.</li>
    <li> Honrdtly... for some reason it doesn&#x27;t smell as good as the one at the store... It seems very strong but it still smells good.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the real thing A fake Compare the packaging with the real thing AND it cannot be returned Buyer Beware</li>
    <li> I received a fake product. If you want something that you have smelled and the smell has lasted throughout the day,choose wisely. I don&#x27;t think every fragrance sold on this site is a knock-off but you HAVE to know that what you are buying is a legitimate product of the company. The product I received was/is fake no questions about it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this smell!! I was so excited when I received it in time for my big party!! Happy customer!!</li>
    <li> I like Billionaire Boyfriend better.  It&#x27;s just okay. Not sure why, I just wasnt as impressed as Bill. boy.  It didn&#x27;t last that long on me. I do wish the mini came in a spray, I hate dabbing on perfume.</li>
    <li> I loved it, it is lovely it is just what I expected as I had smelt it on a friend of mine and that is why I ordered it, really lovely</li>
