      <li>Works great!</li>
      <li>This came ahead of time which is great!</li>
      <li>works perfectly ..</li>
      <li>This is great stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great product except for the packaging.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great price too.</li>
      <li>This is a good product.  </li>
      <li>Thank you for a great transaction :)</li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>Fast shipping awesome product!</li>
      <li>The smell of the product is nice but doesn&#x27;t linger on your brushes at all.</li>
      <li>Rinses out nicely.</li>
      <li>Great product, the smell is nice and it certainly does the job.</li>
      <li>better off using baby shampoo.</li>
      <li>I love this..</li>
      <li>It would be better if it&#x27;s a soft/squeeze bottle.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>so you inadvertently end up using more than intended.</li>
      <li>I have to take the top off.</li>
      <li>I like the shampoo, however, without a pump you use more product than you need to</li>
      <li>gonn put it inside a bottle thats easy to squeeze.</li>
      <li>Why I&#x27;m giving such a great cleaner three stars?</li>
      <li>The actual cleaner itself is GREAT.</li>
      <li>First off, this product cleaned my makeup brushes better than soap or baby shampoo that I used to use.</li>
      <li>This cleaner alone melts all that gunk out of your makeup brushes and gets them squeaky clean without drying them out.</li>
      <li>I clean my brushes often.  </li>
      <li>It took maybe ten minutes of scrubbing with this shampoo and now that kabuki brush is as beautiful and soft as the day I bought it!</li>
      <li>so then I used the shampoo again and more stuff started streaming out of the brush even after it had run clear the time before.</li>
      <li>Other than that is a good product.</li>
      <li>The product itself seemed to do only an okay job of cleansing my brushes.</li>
      <li>Cleans well and doesn&#x27;t need a large amount to get the job done.  </li>
      <li>and I feel like Im using too much that way.  </li>
      <li>Works very well.</li>
      <li>It really cleaned off all the built up makeup and oils.</li>
      <li>It works Very well.</li>
      <li>I could not believe how much makeup I kept getting out of my brush.</li>
      <li>You have to take the cap off and force it out of the bottle which can be a real hassle.</li>
      <li>This works really well</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t need much at all.</li>
      <li>its out, it takes several washes to get your brushes clean.</li>
      <li>super soft!Will definitely be buying this again 😊💞</li>
      <li>It is a nice mild cleaner, but too hard to use and manage for regular brush cleaning.</li>
      <li>When you want to get product out, you have to screw the top off and pour the product directly into your palm which can waste alot of product.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how much makeup my brushes had in them.it left them looking brand new again and</li>
      <li>Love this stuff, bottle is hard to squeeze though.</li>
      <li>There is no way you can squeeze product because the plastic is completely unforgiving.</li>
      <li>It got some makeup out but nowhere near what this shampoo did</li>
      <li>I use it on natural and synthetic brushes with no fallout issue.</li>
      <li>(this wouldn&#x27;t be near the issue</li>
      <li>Aside from the fact that the bottle is super hard to squeeze I find this cleaner is exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great product, the only downside is that (like stated in other reviews) the bottle is uber hard.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this shampoo and a little goes a long way.  </li>
      <li>A few drops on my brush, rinse with cool water, reshape and let brushes air dry.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never had much success cleaning brushes in the past until I bought this cleanser.</li>
      <li>I wanted to see the pretty pink color again and just get it clean because it&#x27;s not good to let brushes sit that long.</li>

<li> The shampoo is what I expected but the bottle it comes in is super hard that I can&#x27;t squeeze.  </li>
<li> It came very well packaged, the bottle is hard</li>
<li> The bottle was hard to squeeze but, it still worked really well.   </li>
<li> Because I am not able to squeeze the product out of the bottle and have to take off the cap and  pour the product directly on my brushes, I am wasting a ton of product.  </li>
<li> I tried to shake it into the palm of my hand and it came out in thick gel glops and went straight down the sink.  </li>
<li> Had a coastal scents pink kabuki brush that I used for powder for months.</li>
<li> Other than that</li>
<li> but I should have listened to the reviews that said the bottle is made of such hard plastic</li>
<li> The bottle is made of such hard plastic that you can&#x27;t squeeze any product out, forcing you to unscrew the lid and pour it out.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
<li> I used half a bottle in one session and I stopped using it and switched to baby shampoo halfway through.&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
<li> the cleaner is &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; not fabulous.</li>
<li> only thing I don&#x27;t like is the bottle it comes in which is hard as a rock and very hard to squeeze.</li>
<li> My only issue is that the bottle is made out of a very hard plastic and it&#x27;s hard to squeeze the shampoo out.  </li>
<li> But oh my god is it hard to squeeze out of the bottle, pretty much impossible.</li>
<li> The bottle is as hard as glass</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t like the hard bottle</li>
<li> This was a mistake as it made my brush wiry and dull.</li>
<li> the real problem is that the bottle is as thick as glass and it is impossible to get the cleanser out of it!</li>
<li> It&#x27;s seriously like trying to squeeze a rock.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s hard as a ROCK!</li>
<li> And I find it is less expensive and works just as well!</li>
<li> so the cap is useless and have to take it off.</li>
<li> It is difficult to get any of the product out because you can&#x27;t squeeze any of it out.</li>
<li> This stuff is useless.</li>
<li> The darn useless bottle that it comes in!</li>
<li> The bottle is impossible to squeeze though.</li>
<li> The bottle is impossible to squeeze but the soap works well!</li>
<li> The design of the bottle is terrible.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Love this stuff, bottle is hard to squeeze though. It works Very well.</li>
    <li> The shampoo is what I expected but the bottle it comes in is super hard that I can&#x27;t squeeze.  I will be switching the product to s different bottle because I have to open the cap each time and I feel like Im using too much that way.  Other than that is a good product.</li>
    <li> It cleans well! But it could use a different bottle. It would be better if it&#x27;s a soft/squeeze bottle.</li>
    <li> I like the shampoo, however, without a pump you use more product than you need to</li>
    <li> First off, this product cleaned my makeup brushes better than soap or baby shampoo that I used to use. It really cleaned off all the built up makeup and oils. It&#x27;s a great product, the only downside is that (like stated in other reviews) the bottle is uber hard. I have to squeeze with all my might to get a drop out! I&#x27;m thinking of transferring it to a travel squeeze bottle because of this. It&#x27;s seriously like trying to squeeze a rock.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. Don&#x27;t like the hard bottle so the cap is useless and have to take it off. But it still cleans my brushes so that a plus.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping awesome product! Thank you!!</li>
    <li> the cleaner is &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; not fabulous. the real problem is that the bottle is as thick as glass and it is impossible to get the cleanser out of it!</li>

    <li> The actual cleaner itself is GREAT. This cleaner alone melts all that gunk out of your makeup brushes and gets them squeaky clean without drying them out. The smell of the product is nice but doesn&#x27;t linger on your brushes at all. Why I&#x27;m giving such a great cleaner three stars? The darn useless bottle that it comes in! It&#x27;s hard as a ROCK! You can&#x27;t squeeze the product out of the bottle unless you&#x27;re Popeye the sailor man! (-_-) Alot of people say the same thing, believe them. They need to change the bottle that they put this cleaner in. When you want to get product out, you have to screw the top off and pour the product directly into your palm which can waste alot of product. Change the bottle! *shakes fist*</li>
    <li> I could not believe how much makeup I kept getting out of my brush. I then thought I would try another soap I had just to compare. This was a mistake as it made my brush wiry and dull. It got some makeup out but nowhere near what this shampoo did so then I used the shampoo again and more stuff started streaming out of the brush even after it had run clear the time before. It also seemed to recondition by brush as well. This is great stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the bottle it comes in which is hard as a rock and very hard to squeeze. I would prefer a pump or a softer bottle. Still, 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Had a coastal scents pink kabuki brush that I used for powder for months. Never cleaned it. I wanted to see the pretty pink color again and just get it clean because it&#x27;s not good to let brushes sit that long. I&#x27;ve never had much success cleaning brushes in the past until I bought this cleanser. It took maybe ten minutes of scrubbing with this shampoo and now that kabuki brush is as beautiful and soft as the day I bought it!</li>
    <li> This came ahead of time which is great! It came very well packaged, the bottle is hard so im gonn put it inside a bottle thats easy to squeeze. It is enough to last me a while</li>
    <li> Works excellent on my makeup brushes</li>
    <li> A few drops on my brush, rinse with cool water, reshape and let brushes air dry.</li>
    <li> This is a good product.  I clean my brushes often.  I couldn&#x27;t find my &#x27;regular&#x27; cleaner,&lt;br /&gt;so I thought I would give this one a go.  And I find it is less expensive and works just as well!</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this cleaner but I don&#x27;t.  The bottle is as hard as glass so you cannot squeeze the shampoo out. I tried to shake it into the palm of my hand and it came out in thick gel glops and went straight down the sink.  It is a nice mild cleaner, but too hard to use and manage for regular brush cleaning.</li>
    <li> The design of the bottle is terrible. There is no way you can squeeze product because the plastic is completely unforgiving. So I had to unscrew the lid to use it (this wouldn&#x27;t be near the issue it is if it weren&#x27;t for the cap having a closable spout leading one to believe you could use it that way). Doing it this way means there is a ton of product that comes out so you inadvertently end up using more than intended. The product itself seemed to do only an okay job of cleansing my brushes. It seems like there is still a residue leftover even after I&#x27;ve let a brush sit in running water and manipulating it with my fingers to rinse it out. Overall, I won&#x27;t be a return customer.</li>
    <li> The bottle is impossible to squeeze but the soap works well!</li>
    <li> Cleanses brushes well</li>
    <li> Great item for brush cleaning!</li>
    <li> This works really well but I should have listened to the reviews that said the bottle is made of such hard plastic, I cannot squeeze it. I have to take the top off.</li>
    <li> Great product except for the packaging. It is difficult to get any of the product out because you can&#x27;t squeeze any of it out.</li>
    <li> Works great! Don&#x27;t need much at all. The bottle is impossible to squeeze though.</li>
    <li> Cleans well and doesn&#x27;t need a large amount to get the job done.  Rinses out nicely.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Works very well.</li>
    <li> The bottle was hard to squeeze but, it still worked really well.   Here&#x27;s a review of it on my youtube channel.    [...]</li>
    <li> Aside from the fact that the bottle is super hard to squeeze I find this cleaner is exactly what I needed. I was my brushes out fully once a week and this gets out even my gel eyeliner from my synthetic brushes. It&#x27;s a great price too.</li>
    <li> Because I am not able to squeeze the product out of the bottle and have to take off the cap and  pour the product directly on my brushes, I am wasting a ton of product.  I won&#x27;t repurchase this.</li>
    <li> works perfectly ..I love this..I couldn&#x27;t believe how much makeup my brushes had in them.it left them looking brand new again and super soft!Will definitely be buying this again 😊💞</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this shampoo and a little goes a long way.  My only issue is that the bottle is made out of a very hard plastic and it&#x27;s hard to squeeze the shampoo out.  Other than that it&#x27;s a great product!~ Thank you for a great transaction :)</li>
    <li> The product itself works well but It makes no sense to put it in a bottle that you can&#x27;t squeeze. You have to take the cap off and force it out of the bottle which can be a real hassle.</li>
