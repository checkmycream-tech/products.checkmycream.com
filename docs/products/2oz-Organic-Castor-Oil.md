    <li> High quality Castor Oil.  Packaging is very easy to work with as well as attractive.  I will be re-ordering for my aromatherapy business.  Don&#x27;t hesitate!</li>
    <li> In the few days I&#x27;ve had my castor oil, its cleared up blemishes (1 day!), refreshed my skin and soothed chapped lips. I&#x27;m looking forward to continuing to see the benefits of castor oil on my skin.</li>
    <li> I have just opened my bottle and an excited to begin using it!</li>
    <li> Love the quality of this oil!</li>
    <li> I love this product. The best castor oil I have ever order.  I like the fact that it was delivered on a Sunday.</li>
    <li> Everything I expected it to be! I use it every night to clean my face. I mix it with another oil. My skin feels great!</li>
    <li> Just received this in the mail and I am so excited to use it with my essential oils! I made some wonderful face moisturizer with this Castor Oil.</li>
    <li> Surpassingly great quality. It arrived quickly and will make a wonderful addition to my homemade bath and body products.</li>
    <li> Excellent castor oil from pure acres. I recommend any of the products they offer!</li>
    <li> This castor oil is excellent.  It is nice and thick like one expects castor oil to be.  I used it in my homemade lip chap and it gives it just the right amount of shine and really helps the lip chap to glide on the lips ever so smoothly.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> great oil for essential oils.  really fast shipping.  fantastic product!</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping and great carrier oil!</li>
    <li> This oil is wonderful!  It&#x27;s beautifully packaged, and feels wonderful on my skin!</li>
    <li> Once again great packaging and fat shipment. I love this oil for my face. It takes away imperfections and moisturizes too.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with Pure Acre Farms Castor oil! I am using it as a carrier oil for my essential oils and it pairs nicely. It was delivered on time and exactly as described. I will definitely buy it again!</li>
    <li> This oil is exactly what I was looking for.  Pure Acres Farm has very good products. No complaints!!</li>
    <li> Great oil with 2 lids</li>
    <li> Awesome product. I use castor oil in many of my homemade products and this one is top quality. I love the way it feels by itself. It also blends well with other oils and butters.</li>
    <li> Great oil and great price thanks!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and the packaging was great so it didn&#x27;t leak or nothing! And I love the skin benefits! I will definitely be a repeat customer!</li>
    <li> This will last a long time!  I was afraid it would have an offensive smell, but it doesn&#x27;t, it is a light nutty smell.</li>
    <li> Love the Pure Farm Pure Castor Oil! Especially like the pump that comes with it so I have more control over how much comes out!</li>
    <li> Great product quick delivery very happy</li>
    <li> Size of the bottle is perfect.  No aroma; perfect consistency.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> This castor oil is great. Just like all oils from Pure Acre Farms they have a manufactured date and an expiration date. I love that about their oils. I have purchased oils from essential oil companies that don&#x27;t even do that. I have used the oil on my hair and skin. It is not too oily. It soaks in fast and leaves the skin really soft and smooth. This is a really  great oil you will be happy using this one. It is really great on my hair. It leaves my hair healthier.</li>
    <li> Great product. I use it for skin care and I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> I use this product in making my own natural health care products.  It works great with a combination of other oils to make salves.  It is a quality oil and I am very satisfied with it.  I will not hesitate to order it again.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have used Castor Oil so I was surprised at how think it was. It made a great massage oil. I did not smell anything when I applied it to my skin.</li>
    <li> This is another quality product from Pure Acres Farm. Nice thick consistency and no odor. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> My first time using this product. I love it! Would recommend it. Thank you!</li>
    <li> So far I have only used it at night on my face. It is a thicker oil than the almond and coconut oil I bought. I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it any other way, but I am happy with the castor oil so far.</li>
    <li> I love castor  oil , I use it on my joints, it eases stiffness and the aches....good stuff!!</li>
    <li> Great company, great product!</li>
    <li> Great oil for using with my essential oils!  Quick shipment, and great packaging. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Arrived fast,nicely packaged ,wonderful product!</li>
    <li> I have been using castor oil for many years and you just can&#x27;t beat the price and quality of this oil. Love it</li>
    <li> Great product!!  The consistency is great (thick) and it has no scent.  It is great as a moisturizer and also awesome for hair!</li>
    <li> Like the bigger size of the bottle and two cap options.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great! I regularly use castor oil and I would purchase this again!</li>
    <li> Great oil for the skin and as a carrier oil.  Also a great company to work with when ordering!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful oil with many uses for hair and skin.</li>
    <li> Happy with this purchase as well as others from this company!  I&#x27;d highly suggest this for the price, quality and speed of delivery!  :)</li>
    <li> This is the perfect carrier oil. I add some carrot seed oil, put it into a small roller bottle and use it every day on my face. The oil is a nice consistency and leaves my skin very soft. I also like to keep some in my kitchen to put on my hands after washing my hands. I like to add lavender for after shower oil. I have added it to my bath water as well.</li>
    <li> Great product!! I am ver pleased with it!</li>
    <li> Love this castor oil!  It was packaged very carefully as well!  I have pinned so many uses for castor oil from hair health to wrinkles and I can&#x27;t wait to get started using it!!</li>
    <li> Great castor oil for a great price!! Can&#x27;t wait to try more DIY items with castor oil, I used it for an eyelash serum with essential oils and it works wonders!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely be buying more from them in the future!</li>
    <li> great stuff and great s&amp;H</li>
    <li> Seems like a good oil.  I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of time.  I like that there is a manufacturing date, expiration date and lot number.</li>
    <li> We got our bottle of Prue Castor oil, to use for hair and skin it has help with dry skin we have yet had a chance to try with the hair yet but as soon as we do I will up date my review. It&#x27;s great for moisturizer, there is no smell to it. If you&#x27;d like you can add a natural oil to it for a smell. And added benefits.</li>
    <li> The Castor Oil is very thick and almost sticky feeling.  However, it is not greasy like coconut oil.  It seems to moisturize my skin well.</li>
    <li> Love this oil. I used it with my doTERRA essential oils on my face and neck. It was great. I live in the desert so moisture is a must. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love this oil! It is a slightly thicker oil because that is the nature of castor, but it is not too thick and is not sticky as some others are. I use it in the shaving soaps I make and it is really great...soothing to the skin and it makes great lather. This is also a great oil to use as a carrier for massage oils!</li>
    <li> This Castor Oil has a nice fresh smell and soaks into skin easily. It is not gummy like some castor oil is. It is a great consistency for making packs.</li>
    <li> LOVE this oil. It is thick but not too heavy and is great as a carrier oil.  I mix it with coconut oil and both are perfect for my salt scrubs!! There is no fragrance which makes it perfect for my projects.  It comes with a flip top which makes it easier to manage.  I love Pure Acres and would trust any of their products.</li>
    <li> A beautiful oil.  I use castor oil in making my soaps and the price on this oil was fantastic.  I love the fact that it come with a choice of 3 tops.  That rocks.</li>
    <li> Awesome castor oil, packaged nicely, no leakage.. Fast shipping as well. Thank you!</li>
    <li> First off, I love that they ship it in a plastic bag just in case. The bottle is sealed but you never know. They also include a flip top cap which is very useful. I have used this oil on my lips, eyelashes, and under my eyes. I love the consistency. It&#x27;s a little thick but not too thick. My lips are so soft.  My eyelashes look longer.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference under my eyes yet but I haven&#x27;t been using this very long. I would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> Great quality Castor Oil for a great price.</li>
    <li> Really nice oil. Oil doesn&#x27;t smell bad. Works great for bread oil!</li>
    <li> Made a great carrier oil</li>
    <li> I am really liking this Castro OIl.  It has been great so far</li>
    <li> Great product, using for making my own lotions and balms.&lt;br /&gt;Quick shipping and great packaging...</li>
    <li> very clear, has manufacture date &amp; expiration date on it, works great</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this Castor Oil...unlike other brands I have purchased.  Goes on thick feeling, but absorbed, greaseless feeling !  Very happy !</li>
    <li> Love! Great products.</li>
    <li> 5/30/16 UPDATE - The Pure Acres Farm Castor Oil that I purchased and reviewed was a 16 oz. plastic bottle for $10.97. It appears that they have changed their packaging and it is now being offered in a glass 2 oz. bottle. There has been questions regarding how this oil was processed. When I purchased this oil, there is no indication of any kind on the bottle of how it was processed. However, upon inspection of the stock photo they are using to promote the 2 oz. bottle of this oil, it does clearly state on the front of the bottle that it is cold pressed. As I stated in my original review that I would purchase this again even if I had to pay regular price. However, since they have changed the packaging and cost, my sentiments on that have changed. I will state that it does appear that on the new packaging they are stating that this oil is organic and that was not stated on my original 16 oz. bottle. Either way, I wanted everyone who may read this to know that I have not reviewed the 4 oz. bottle of this product, but my review show up here.  This is a very thick and nourishing oil that is great for dry skin and it has almost no scent. It is a translucent, very pale yellow oil which has anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties and has so many wonderful therapeutic and medicinal benefits.  It can be used to promote hair growth as well as thickening hair and is a great hair conditioner to bring back shine and help nourish split ends. It helps treat dandruff and other scalp conditions and can be used to thicken eyelashes and eyebrows too. It is good for treating sunburns and helping reduce the appearance of scars....the list goes on and on for this great oil. It can be used internally as it can strengthen the immune system, but it does have a rather strong and unpleasant taste. And I will add that this particular castor oil does state on the bottle that it is recommended for external use only. I have been using it mixed with a few other oils each night in the oil cleansing method and have been very pleased with the quality of this oil. My skin is much smoother and softer and it works great as a facial moisturizer. I have also used it for skin applications where a more intense, deep nourishing treatment is necessary and it has been working wonders for my dry and brittle nails.  I really appreciate the fact that the company placed a sticker on the side of the bottle that stated the manufacturing date as well as the expiration date. Sometimes when you order products and this information is nowhere to be found, it really makes it impossible to determine an accurate shelf life. It also included the lot number which is a great addition if there was a problem or specific question in regards to the product. The product label does state that it is 100% pure castor oil, and that is the only ingredient listed under the ingredients category as well.  I would purchase this oil again and I am looking forward to learning more uses for this great oil.  I received this product at a discounted rate and I am providing my honest, unbiased review. I am not receiving any type of compensation, incentive, or reward for my review and I am not under any obligation to provide a positive review. I give honest reviews based on my own personal use and testing as well as the products performance and attributes. I recently started reviewing products not only because I enjoy it, but because I know how important product reviews can be in helping others determine the quality, effectiveness, and overall value of a product.

    <li> Came quick and works great</li>
    <li> Excellent Product and excellent value!</li>
    <li> The castor oil is amazing.</li>
    <li> Love this oil!  Decent scent and great for many uses, such as a carrier for essential oils!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the castor oil and was very surprised at the honey like texture. When I mixed it with another carrier oil, I liked it a little better. I have not noticed a difference in my skin, but I have only been using it for a week.</li>
    <li> I think this product is awesome. I have only used castor oil once before and it was pretty disgusting:/ This does not have the same smell as normal castor oil, it really has no smell at all, which is a good thing. I put it in my lotion and it is thick but doesn&#x27;t have a grimey feel, I also used a little bit in a hair serum and am so excited to see how my hair looks in a couple of weeks!</li>
    <li> I am super excited to have this product! I once bought Castor Oil from the drugstore and let me say, this is SO much better! It&#x27;s consistency is thick like honey (as it should be) and doesn&#x27;t leave a smell on my skin. I am currently using it to aid in growing my eyelashes thicker and stronger. If you look up the benefits of Castor Oil, you&#x27;ll be amazed at all its&#x27; variety of uses. My husband and mother in-law are now also using this as well. Great brand, great product! 5 stars all the way!</li>
    <li> Great quality oil. The texture is really thick.</li>
    <li> Great oil for scars and stretch marks!  Blends well with my Young Living essential oils.  I will definitely recommend this to my customers!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I&#x27;ve tried it several times for my hair. My hair is very shiny and thick.</li>
    <li> Nice texture, mild smell</li>
    <li> Wonderful oil!  The price was right and I received it quickly.  Thanks so much for a great product!</li>
    <li> So excited about having this!  I use castor oil for many things such as minimize bruising, hair regrowth/thickening, moisturizer, and so much more have already had a postive experience with Pure Acre&#x27;s fractionated coconut oil!  I love that it came with a pour spout for easy distribution. THANK YOU!  Great company#</li>
    <li> Oil is thick and clear. Purchased to make soap, but after reading the free e-book offered with purchase, I will be trying it in recipes for cosmetic use as well. Love that the bottle is 16 oz and priced similarly to a tiny bottle I purchased at a local drugstore. Love Pure Acres Farms products!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! I will definitely be ordering again😊</li>
    <li> This is a very thick, gooey, sticky oil. It is really not appropriate for an all over body moisturizer, in my opinion. I have been using it succesfully as an overnight foot, hand and cuticle moisturizer though, and it works great in this capacity. Living in a very dry climate, it&#x27;s hard to find something that will keep these areas comfortably moisturized all night long. So far, this is the best product (cream or oil) that I have used for this purpose. It is important to note that this oil has no smell. I am pleased with this product, although I have not yet received the accompanying e book detailing different ways to use it.  **I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest product review</li>
    <li> Castor Oil is perfect for sealing in moisture and I used in a few hand lotions that I made in conjunction with another carrier oil and it worked great. Read the Castor Oil has antifungal, antibacterial and antiviral properties so I look forward to experimenting with this! Nice product!</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery. Gives you an expiration date a few years out.</li>
    <li> I had never used castor oil, but I am so pleased with this purchase!</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was shopping for. Great quality in a nice size for many purposes.  Quick shipping and I appreciate the additional squeeze cap you provided.</li>
    <li> Using it for oil facial cleansing and loving it so far!</li>
    <li> Love this castor oil! I use it every other day on my face in the evening during my routine face washing/moisturizing. It is super thick and stick but after a minute or two it isn&#x27;t so bad. I also use it on my kids knees and elbows for their super dry skin. I&#x27;ve really fallen in love with this brand of carrier oils.</li>
    <li> I just love all Pure Acre Farms products.  I use the fractionated Coconut oi too~  Highly recommend this company and their products.</li>
    <li> Another oil from Pure Acres Farm which doesn&#x27;t disappoint.  I love the size.  The oil is clear and fresh.  I really love that the bottle has the mfg. date as well as the exp. date.  That is so helpful since I don&#x27;t want to be using old oil.  I especially love the e-Book that Pure Acres Farm gave access to.  The recipes are great, and so far I&#x27;m loving the ones that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I Love using it for dry feet and heals</li>
    <li> I have really never used castor oil before so I do not have any other brand to compare it to. When I did first open the bottle I noticed that there was no smell to it and that the oil is really think. Not really knowing much about it I started reading other reviews and read what everyone else was using it for. So far I have only tried it on the ends of my hair as what another reviewer stated that she used it for. It does make the ends of your hair soft and silky. I am looking forward in trying this out in the winter when my skin gets really dried out as many people say that it works well on the dried skin. I will be buying this again!</li>
    <li> First thing is first, shipping for my castor oil was FAST! I usually use almond oil to dilute my essential oils for clients but there are some that don&#x27;t like almond oil. I gave this castor oil a try and LOVE it. I am so glad that I found an alternative that my clients are happy with!</li>
    <li> I really like using this castor oil. I put it on my eyelashes every night and I have noticed my lashes are getting thicker. I have also used it to take makeup off my face and it does a great job. I have also used it on my hair and leave it on for about 45 minutes and then wash it out and it makes my hair so incredibly soft.</li>
    <li> Nice product, works how it says it will. I make homemade shampoo and it is one of the ingredients.</li>
    <li> Awesome brand of oil! Using it as a carrier oil for essential oils is great. Works exactly as expected!</li>
    <li> Excellent oil to use as a carrier oil with essential oils. Light enough for sprays or in roller balls.</li>
    <li> I received a discount coupon to buy this at a lower rate, but the opinion is my own. I was running low on caster oil and gladly accepted their offer to try their oil. I compared it to my older brand (Humco) and its the same, except for the price. I only get 6 ounces at my local pharmacy for $9 and the Pure Acres Farm has 16 ounces for $11 (at the time I write this on 8/23/2015).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caster oil is great for the hair and can help make hair grow faster and thicker when applied regularly. It also helps split ends when you apply it for 10 minutes before your shower. You can use it all over you hair once in a while if its normal or oily, but that might require a lot of shampooing to get it out. I apply it to the ends of my hair only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying this oil again. Pure Acres Farm has made me a repeat customer. I tried them for their coupon deals, but I really like their oils.</li>
    <li> Great product and wonderful price.  I have not been disappointed with any of my Pure Acres Farm products.  Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> This stuff is GREAT! I use it in my scar blend with my Young Living essential oils and it works fantastically! Can&#x27;t wait to try it for all the other uses.</li>
    <li> As always I love Pure Acres Farm products!!! They are always shipped quickly and in a protective manner. I look forward to using the Pure Castor Oil for my skin, hair and health benefits. Thanks again Pure Acres Farm for another product well done.</li>
    <li> I received a discount coupon for this purchase, but this opinion is wholly my own. This is my second purchase of Pure Acres Farm oils, and am very satisfied with quality of their products. Castor oil is very thick and very good for dry skin. I used it mixed with a little sweet almond oil on my very dry and peeling sun tanned skin. I have also used it sparingly in my hair. I&#x27;ve already looked up a few DIY recipes using castor oil and intend to make and use them very soon. I&#x27;m a very satisfied customer and intend to purchase other oils from Pure Acres Farm when I run out of my current supplies.</li>
    <li> great product, fast shipping, Thank you</li>
    <li> I have been very happy with this castor oil. Great quality.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! 100% pure, &amp; a nice consistency. I use this mixed with essential oils for everything from helping to thicken my hair, lashes &amp; eye brows to helping to heal bruises. Give this brand a try - I&#x27;m sure you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I love castor oil, this oil is great, and a nice large bottle.  My biggest problem is that the sticker on it says it was manufactured 6/16/15, and expires 6/15/15, so it will expire a day before it was made  :)</li>
    <li> Great castor oil! My dad uses this product to relieve his gout and it works great. I&#x27;ve been using it as part of a face wash and I love it! I&#x27;ve tried other brands and this one excels!! I appreciate the packaging and option of a squeeze top or a regular lid closure.</li>
    <li> I use castor oil to eases the pain of arthritis, help heal my cracked heels, and for corn removal.  Pure Farms Castor Oil is an outstanding product as it works faster to relieve my conditions.  I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> Great quality oil.  Thanks for including the pump!</li>
    <li> I bought the castor oil to use in my hair along with a few other oils and love the difference so far!</li>
    <li> This is a nice, thicker oil, and although I expected it to have a strong smell, it did not!  I loved how it absorbed quickly into my skin; no &amp;#34;slimy&amp;#34; feeling like some other oils.  It arrived more quickly than promised, and I&#x27;m looking forward to finding more ways to use it!</li>
    <li> Very nice product! I lookforwardbto using it in a few DIY products.</li>
    <li> Great oil. Great for carrier oil for essential oils.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. Does wonderful in my face wash</li>
    <li> Never used a castor oil before but I&#x27;ll be sure to stick to this brand! It&#x27;s a great consistency and goes well with my essential oils!</li>
    <li> Definitely would recommend.</li>
    <li> Great product! Made beard oil for a relative. Perfect.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much, I did some research and found that caster oil also has many health benefits. One of those are helping my feet. See, I love to be bare foot and the causes my feet to be rough and callus. I read that the feet absorb pretty quickly, unlike if you were to put this thick oil on your face, I believe it would clog the pores whereas the pores in our feet are bigger and seem to handle it better. So I&#x27;ve made a mix of castor oil and 2 drops thieves essential oil and been massaging it into my feet I think it&#x27;s making a difference. Oh it&#x27;s suppose to be very good at cleaning you out too, my Nana even said that&#x27;s what they used in her day. [sorry I don&#x27;t know how to use it for that though]</li>
    <li> This oil is great...it&#x27;s the only one i&#x27;ll use now</li>
    <li> I received a generous discount on this product and I&#x27;m very pleased to say the least! I use a lot of styling products and prefer to use natural hair conditioners to keep myhair healthy and Castor oil is a key ingredient combined with (2) egg yolks, equal parts castor oil, coconut oil and evvo which is my weekly deep condtioner treatment! Pure Farms castor oil blended very well, no irration, dyes or perfumes and works great with facial mask as well!</li>
    <li> I love the way this oil make my skin feel and look.  I&#x27;m looking forward to making many things with this fantastic oil.</li>
    <li> I received my castor oil and immediately starting making roller bottles with my Young Living essential oils.  I love this oil!!</li>
    <li> As always, Pure Acres Farm delivers an exceptional product. You get a large size for a great price and you know it is a quality product.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this company and their products. There are so many great uses for castor oil that I didn&#x27;t even realize until looking it up. It is especially good for hair, skin and nails.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love it!!!!!! We have used it on hair, for acne, on my skin and internally.</li>
    <li> quick shipping, excellent for hair growth</li>
    <li> Really pleased with the castor oil even though I have only used it a few times.  Great for my homemade hot oil cleanser recipe!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it much yet but it appears to be a qualityv</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m trying Castor Oil for hair growth, so I really like that this brand is less sticky than others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
