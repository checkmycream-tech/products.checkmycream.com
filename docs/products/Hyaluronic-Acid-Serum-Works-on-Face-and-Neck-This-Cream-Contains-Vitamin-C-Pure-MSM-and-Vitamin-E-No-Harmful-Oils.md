      <li>This product its amazing thank you so much again.</li>
      <li>I am realistic and am not trying to look like my 30&#x27;s but just want to be the best that I can be with what I have left.</li>
      <li>This is also a powerful serum to fight my age spots!</li>
      <li>I probably lost a lot of what I had gained all of my life because it seems like it sure did happen awfully fast!</li>
      <li>I like how it quickly absorbs.</li>
      <li>the product is not greasy and absorbs quickly</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a skeptic when it comes to facial serums and creams that advertise amazing results.</li>
      <li>I love how soft my face feels after I use it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;You will also get Guaranteed Results along with the satisfaction of knowing that it&#x27;s made right here in the United States, has no parabens and won&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy.</li>
      <li>have very dry skin so the moisture that it gives me along with plumping up of the fine lines and wrinkles has been an added bonus to helping me look somewhat better.</li>
      <li>The packaging is very high end and slick, easy to use and very sexy.</li>
      <li>I really miss that!</li>
      <li>It makes your skin feel tighter when you first apply it</li>
      <li>When I first used Algenist, for example, I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes.</li>
      <li>I am seeing positive results lighter age spots and firmer skin.</li>
      <li>and this product is pure</li>
      <li>i expected much more from this product than i got.</li>
      <li>Reasonably priced product line.</li>
      <li>I have very oily skin</li>
      <li>This (Bonapiel) serum does not irritate my eye area, though I admit I avoid the eye area in general  and instead use a very gentle cream (like First Aid Skin Care) around the eyes, then apply Bonapiel serum on the rest of my face.</li>
      <li>I believe I have got the same results and better from OTC serums such as Olay regenerist etc.</li>
      <li>I let it dry for a few minutes, and then apply a good moisturizer all over.  </li>
      <li>My neck is starting to sag right underneath my chin.</li>
      <li>The biggest difference I&#x27;ve noticed was when I put my makeup on my fine lines/ dark spots are gone.  </li>
      <li>So, I am loving this new serum because it tones and firms the cheeks and the sides of my face where it looks like it has gotten the worse.</li>
      <li>first I will put it on and be sure it dry , I will usually leave it on to work for about 2 hrs and than add my night cream</li>
      <li>-not tight.  </li>
      <li>The combination of active ingredients forms a powerful anti-aging mix.</li>
      <li>used it faithfully after receiving it and have found that it works only as well as the dmae firming fluid i can buy from local super supplements (and that dmae firming fluid is just 12.00)</li>
      <li>Apparently my obsession with straws is to blame!</li>
      <li>This Bonapiel serum is only of the few I&#x27;ve seen with Vitamin C, which together with the hyaluronic acid and other ingredients does make the skin beautifully smooth to the touch and gently tightened.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t get a chance to try it, label on outside was old looking</li>
      <li>This product has helped make my face feel fresh and firm</li>
      <li>its works really well with other products</li>
      <li>I am a 55 year old African american women.</li>
      <li>Only used for a few days, but feels right.</li>
      <li>Been using it for a couple weeks now and can&#x27;t say that I see any difference good or bad.</li>

<li> Been using it for a couple weeks now and can&#x27;t say that I see any difference good or bad.</li>
<li> but as I have gotten older it has been harder and harder for me to keep my face from losing the firmness that I used to have.</li>
<li> It is much less expensive than the others, for starters, and it does indeed have a nice effect on the skin.</li>
<li> I have purchased expensive and cheap products to help me correct this problem with no &amp;#34;noticeable&amp;#34; results as promised.</li>
<li> See not improvement yet, not what I expected.</li>
<li> Saw reduction in forehead wrinkles and other areas</li>
<li> Apply in the evening, cuts down on time and money having all these ingredients in just one bottle.</li>
<li> The product is a bit sticky but that&#x27;s typical with skin serums.</li>
<li> i do like this product, however, it is a bit too expensive and u can find similar products with the same ingredients for much less money!</li>
<li> Did you know that the sucking on a straw everyday can cause those lines?</li>
<li> but it feels dried out.</li>
<li> My face hasn&#x27;t broken out and that&#x27;s a big plus for me!  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using it everyday.</li>
<li> I am rating this two stars only because of the poor performance.</li>
<li> You need very little.</li>
<li> But after a few months, Algenist began to irritate the delicate skin around my eyes....</li>
<li> I was not sure if this product would do anything for my face.  </li>
<li> You can hardly see any pores.</li>
<li> Oh, and this product usually lasts for about 18 months before it expires, but you should be done with it by then!</li>
<li> Sorry - was not satisfied with this product as advertised.  </li>
<li> so I haven&#x27;t seen any dramatic results</li>
<li> Awful look, and hard to conceal with makeup.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have been only using this product for a couple of weeks so I haven&#x27;t seen any dramatic results but I do love it. I have very oily skin and this serum keeps it under control. I love how soft my face feels after I use it. I have noticed that some of the brown patches on my face are lightening up. I am going to continue using this product and will purchase again.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> My face hasn&#x27;t broken out and that&#x27;s a big plus for me!  I like the way it feels on my face.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t get a chance to try it, label on outside was old looking</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this serum. I&#x27;ve been using it everyday. My skin is glowing, oil is under control, and my skin tone has dramatically improved since I started using this hyaluronic acid. It&#x27;s excellent for moisture.</li>
    <li> Seemed to be effective.  Saw reduction in forehead wrinkles and other areas but I cannot afford the price.</li>
    <li> I am rating this two stars only because of the poor performance. I am a 55 year old African american women. My neck is starting to sag right underneath my chin.I look in the mirror and see sagging/ wrinkled skin starting in this area. I have purchased expensive and cheap products to help me correct this problem with no &amp;#34;noticeable&amp;#34; results as promised. I have used the Murad and similiar products that rave about the results in clinical tests which bates me in to try the product. Nothing has worked to my satisfaction.  I still see the sagging skin. I have only used this product for about three weeks.  Will give feed-back in another 30 days.</li>
    <li> Like the serum and love that it contains vitamin C and HA. Apply in the evening, cuts down on time and money having all these ingredients in just one bottle. I like and would recommend.</li>
    <li> i expected much more from this product than i got. used it faithfully after receiving it and have found that it works only as well as the dmae firming fluid i can buy from local super supplements (and that dmae firming fluid is just 12.00)</li>
    <li> Excellent! Feels refreshing on my face! Yeah!  You need to give this product  a try.  You will like it.  Gail</li>
    <li> Great product I love how it makes my skin feel!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Sorry - was not satisfied with this product as advertised.  Didn&#x27;t see any immediate results; used night-time as well as daytime.</li>
    <li> I am seeing positive results lighter age spots and firmer skin. Hope this continues with continued use. Reasonably priced product line.</li>
    <li> I have a new skincare product that I think you are going to love called Bonapiel Beauty &amp; Youth Serum that has Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin C and MSM as the top three ingredients in this super awesome serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know about most of you but as I have gotten older it has been harder and harder for me to keep my face from losing the firmness that I used to have. I really miss that! So, I am loving this new serum because it tones and firms the cheeks and the sides of my face where it looks like it has gotten the worse. I love how the serum itself glides on very smoothly and absorbs well without leaving my skin looking like I have grease on it, which is something I hate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very dry skin so the moisture that it gives me along with plumping up of the fine lines and wrinkles has been an added bonus to helping me look somewhat better. I am realistic and am not trying to look like my 30&#x27;s but just want to be the best that I can be with what I have left. I am sure my health situation hasn&#x27;t made things easy on me either. I probably lost a lot of what I had gained all of my life because it seems like it sure did happen awfully fast! And I used to be religious about my nighttime and morning routines, so it wasn&#x27;t that I wasn&#x27;t trying!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will also get Guaranteed Results along with the satisfaction of knowing that it&#x27;s made right here in the United States, has no parabens and won&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy. They have a 100% Money Back Guarantee if you don&#x27;t like the results, so if you don&#x27;t see any, then get your money back. Can&#x27;t beat that! Oh, and this product usually lasts for about 18 months before it expires, but you should be done with it by then!</li>
    <li> i do like this product, however, it is a bit too expensive and u can find similar products with the same ingredients for much less money!</li>
    <li> Been using it for a couple weeks now and can&#x27;t say that I see any difference good or bad. It makes your skin feel tighter when you first apply it but it feels dried out. I will finish this container but I won&#x27;t be reordering unless I see something that I am not experiencing at this point.</li>
    <li> You can feel it working. My skin is softer. You can hardly see any pores. great product. You need very little.</li>
    <li> This product has helped make my face feel fresh and firm -not tight.  The biggest difference I&#x27;ve noticed was when I put my makeup on my fine lines/ dark spots are gone.  I just had a facial yesterday and was told to keep using the serum because vitamin C is excellent for the skin- and this product is pure</li>
    <li> I use this serum daily. I like how it quickly absorbs. The combination of active ingredients forms a powerful anti-aging mix.</li>
    <li> I love this product I use it under my moisturizer on a clean face. first I will put it on and be sure it dry , I will usually leave it on to work for about 2 hrs and than add my night cream its works really well with other products and I love it .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample so I could review it on my blog , youtube and amazon but my opinions are my own</li>
    <li> Only used for a few days, but feels right. I think it was just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a skeptic when it comes to facial serums and creams that advertise amazing results. I&#x27;ve used Algenist, StriVektin, and Ole Henriksen, among others.  I read the reviews (which we all should be thankful to Amazon for posting) and decided to try the Bonapiel serum. It is much less expensive than the others, for starters, and it does indeed have a nice effect on the skin. No, it will not perform miracles. Let&#x27;s face it, the only way to eliminate sagging chins and eyes with age (especially in one&#x27;s 50s and 60s) is not going to be as simple as applying a serum! Only surgery can do that.  This Bonapiel serum is only of the few I&#x27;ve seen with Vitamin C, which together with the hyaluronic acid and other ingredients does make the skin beautifully smooth to the touch and gently tightened. When I first used Algenist, for example, I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes. I loved it! But after a few months, Algenist began to irritate the delicate skin around my eyes.... to the point where the skin became red and irritated. Awful look, and hard to conceal with makeup. I had to discontinue its use. This (Bonapiel) serum does not irritate my eye area, though I admit I avoid the eye area in general  and instead use a very gentle cream (like First Aid Skin Care) around the eyes, then apply Bonapiel serum on the rest of my face. I let it dry for a few minutes, and then apply a good moisturizer all over.  The result is wonderful.</li>
    <li> See not improvement yet, not what I expected.</li>
    <li> This product its amazing thank you so much again.</li>
    <li> As advertised, on time</li>
    <li> I love this stuff can see the difference already</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a freak weirdo about my skincare products and gotta say, this product is outstanding. The packaging is very high end and slick, easy to use and very sexy. The product is a bit sticky but that&#x27;s typical with skin serums. What I like about this one is it&#x27;s fragrance free and I can feel it working on my skin. Twice a day, I use this on my face as well as my neck and decolletage which ALL women should be doing from day one of beginning their skin regime! I&#x27;m about half-way done with this bottle and I expect to use it to the very last drop.</li>
    <li> The pump on the bottle doesn&#x27;t work. I can&#x27;t even use it. So therefore, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s any good or not.</li>
    <li> This one has everything I want in a serum! Hyaluronic Acid AND Vitamin C!! It also has MSM (this one I had to look up!) This one helps with fine lines around my eyes and around my mouth.  Now even though I have never smoked a day in my life I am getting smoker lines on my upper lip? What?!?!?!?! WHY?!??! Apparently my obsession with straws is to blame! Did you know that the sucking on a straw everyday can cause those lines? Yup!! I use a straw almost every time I have a drink. ACKKK!!! So, while I try and battle that addiction I&#x27;m using Bonapiel Beauty And Youth Serum! This is also a powerful serum to fight my age spots! YEAAAAH!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonapiel Beauty And Youth Serum is lightweight and oil free!!  Not only does this serum tone my skin but it&#x27;s has anti wrinkle properties too. I love Hyaluronic Acid. It keeps your skin hydrated day and night!! Vitamin C reduces signs of environmental damage AND it can help prevent premature aging! SO start using this one ASAP!!!</li>
    <li> I am not too impressed with the results so far of this serum. I believe I have got the same results and better from OTC serums such as Olay regenerist etc. I don&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
    <li> I was not sure if this product would do anything for my face.  But, I was amazed on how it did work.  I use it daily &amp; you can feel it working.  I am very pleased I purchased this item.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer.  Have tried several products and this one definitely exceeds the others.  I definitely notice a tightening of my face and neck.  I&#x27;m on my second bottle and definitely will keep using it.  Just started the eye serum also.</li>
    <li> It seems to be helping.</li>
    <li> I feel so glad with the product, I have been using them during two weeks, My facial skin is much more smooth and bright. the product is not greasy and absorbs quickly</li>
</ol>
