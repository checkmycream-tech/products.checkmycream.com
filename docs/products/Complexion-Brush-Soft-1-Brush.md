      <li>Great complexion brush.</li>
      <li>Good brush.  </li>
      <li>This product is superior in quality and useability.</li>
      <li>Bristles were perfect for me; wanted a brush I could use on  my face with mild bar soap.  </li>
      <li>I am very pleased with the size.</li>
      <li>Love this brush!  </li>
      <li>Inexpensive, effective, and durable.  </li>
      <li>I use the model that has a detachable handle so as to give me more flexibility.</li>
      <li>I love it...</li>
      <li>This is an okay brush.  </li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>bristle in a plastic handle would be a better choice.  </li>
      <li>Love this....much better than the nylon bristle ones you sometimes find in CVS, etc.</li>
      <li>Great product so far.</li>
      <li>It is a touch too large for my face but the firmness is perfect for my sensitive skin!</li>
      <li>It is sturdy and easy to use.  </li>
      <li>It is easy to take with you on any travel.  </li>
      <li>I am thrilled to find the exact one I had lost.  </li>
      <li>Love the product exactly what I offered thanks Susan very satisfied</li>
      <li>I purchased  the same brush from another supplier (still a great brush) , but.</li>
      <li>they had my facial brush and at a great price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m an esthetician and believe in whole body brushing but not just any brush will do for the facial skin, this brush is wonderful.</li>
      <li>it does not beat up my complexion but leaves it fresh an smooth.</li>
      <li>It assists in circulation and in growing new healthy skin.  </li>
      <li>I like the brush very soft and kinda cute</li>
      <li>It is exactly what I wanted, and my face is, once again, wonderfully clean.  </li>
      <li>I also love the natural bristle vs synthetic.</li>
      <li>But the natural bristle is sure stinky.</li>
      <li>The bristles have just the right amount of coarseness to be useful, without causing discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Removes dry flaky skin on face safely!</li>
      <li>The first one I had over 13 years and lost it on a trip.  </li>
      <li>I am pleased with the product but was hoping it was a bit smaller and softer.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>I believe the first one lasted close to a year before the bristles started falling out.</li>
      <li>The bristle are soft and brush fit in my hand.</li>
      <li>but if you rinse it with hot water before lathering it, it softens some...</li>
      <li>and there is definitely a positive change to my skin.</li>
      <li>Well made products giving positive results.</li>
      <li>I was raised on using a complexion brush to keep the skin clear, and at 55, I still get compliments on having a clear, smooth complexion.</li>
      <li>This is a really quality brush.  </li>
      <li>It discolored much of the wood.</li>
      <li>This is a well made brush but not at all gentle.</li>
      <li>It is perfect for your face or other delicate parts of your body.  </li>
      <li>I have used this brush everyday for the  last two weeks ago my skin feels great and it is never harsh.</li>
      <li>It would be good for heels and elbows but certainly not good for use on the face, etc.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this brush if you want to improve your skin.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this brush and specificity from this supplier.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend the product.</li>
      <li>with Noxema, I spread the cream on my face and then lightly scrub with the wet brush.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m noticing that my complexion is much brighter and that there are far fewer blackheads on my nose (a reap proble spot for me).</li>
      <li>I have even begun using it on my throat and the back of my neck with success.</li>
      <li>I love this little complexion brush!</li>
      <li>This brush is well made with natural components.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 56 years old</li>
      <li>Most are too small for the purpose of facial cleansing.</li>
      <li>Bernard Jensen products come highly recommended so I will probably order the smaller brush eventually.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I expected.</li>
      <li>I recently moved to the west coast and decided I would lighten my load and should probably invest in a new brush.</li>
      <li>Finally, the bristles are so rough that during my first use, I took the skin off of some of my nose.</li>
      <li>The bristles are a tiny bit stiff, but with hot water and use, they will soften.  </li>

<li> The bristles are just the right firmness/gentleness for delicate face and neck skin.</li>
<li> The brush is a bit too stiff and rough at first, but after running it under hot water and soaping it up a few times, it softens up and does the trick!</li>
<li> Dry skin brushing is one of the healthiest activities you can do daily to help your skin.  </li>
<li> just use less pressure at first until the brush softens a little.  </li>
<li> Even though I rinse the brush, shake it dry, and drain it in a dry place immediately after use, so that each morning it spends no more than 3-5 minutes wet, within the first week of use, the handle began to develop a crack, all the way through, along the drill line for a row of bristles.  </li>
<li> Not soft</li>
<li> It is a little stiff at first...</li>
<li> /&gt;Finely grained wood handle, though, was apparently not seasoned properly.  </li>
<li> One tuft of bristles will probably come loose before long, and the crack itself will, of course, eventually become yukky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I appreciate this dry skin brush from Bernard Jensen.  </li>
<li> and I haven&#x27;t a single blackhead or blemish...</li>
<li> The bristles seemed of decent quality, but the handle cracked along the entire base after the first use.  </li>
<li> It is like giving yourself a facial massage everyday.  </li>
<li> For a complexion brush, it would seem like it should be as I expected.  </li>
<li> I tend to use it with either African black soap (raw), or Noxema, depending on the time of year and how dry my skin feels.</li>
<li> I thought the bristles were made of tampico fibre like other brushes from Bernard Jensen.</li>
<li> I have tried other complexion brushes.  </li>
<li> I was worried about brushing my dry face in that it would be too harsh.</li>
<li> BUT not great for use near the olfactory.....</li>
<li> and it oozed black.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using it a few weeks</li>
<li> Really harsh on the skin.</li>
<li> Which at least one reviewer says is to be expected.  </li>
<li> I forgot I bought it small.</li>
<li> Not sure I can bear using it.</li>
<li> I find that the ones that you can buy in the stores are too small and way too soft....if you can find them at all.</li>
<li> but certainly not good for the complexion.</li>
<li> I am looking forward to see how the product holds up with continued use as far as the wood base is concerned.</li>
<li> Firstly, it smells TERRIBLY.</li>
<li> and I use it everyday!!!</li>

    <li> Really harsh on the skin. Not soft at all - I&#x27;d rather use this on my heels than on my face</li>
    <li> Great product so far. I&#x27;ve been using it a few weeks and there is definitely a positive change to my skin.</li>
    <li> This is the second time that I&#x27;ve purchased the Bernard Jensen complexion brush through Amazon. I believe the first one lasted close to a year before the bristles started falling out. The brush is a bit too stiff and rough at first, but after running it under hot water and soaping it up a few times, it softens up and does the trick! I find that the ones that you can buy in the stores are too small and way too soft....if you can find them at all. I was raised on using a complexion brush to keep the skin clear, and at 55, I still get compliments on having a clear, smooth complexion.</li>
    <li> It is a touch too large for my face but the firmness is perfect for my sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> I like the brush very soft and kinda cute lol. I was shocked at how small it was I forgot I bought it small. I love it and I tend to use it on my hands and feet rather then my face.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> I was worried about brushing my dry face in that it would be too harsh. I have used this brush everyday for the  last two weeks ago my skin feels great and it is never harsh. I use the recommended circular method and it works. I have even begun using it on my throat and the back of my neck with success. In addition, I have gone a step further and purchased the body brush and now everything feels energized. I use the model that has a detachable handle so as to give me more flexibility. Well made products giving positive results.</li>
    <li> Great complexion brush. Love it</li>
    <li> Good brush.  Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this brush. Firstly, it smells TERRIBLY. Secondly, the wood began cracking on the second day I had it and it oozed black. It discolored much of the wood. Finally, the bristles are so rough that during my first use, I took the skin off of some of my nose.</li>
    <li> It is exactly what I wanted, and my face is, once again, wonderfully clean.  The bristles are a tiny bit stiff, but with hot water and use, they will soften.  In a word &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34;.  ALSO, MADE IN AMERICA!!</li>
    <li> This is an okay brush.  But the natural bristle is sure stinky. Which at least one reviewer says is to be expected.  BUT not great for use near the olfactory.....</li>
    <li> I have used this brush for years. I recently moved to the west coast and decided I would lighten my load and should probably invest in a new brush. After not having my brush for several weeks I looked all over in all kinds of stores for one but no luck. I decided to check Amazon and wa-la they had my facial brush and at a great price. I&#x27;m an esthetician and believe in whole body brushing but not just any brush will do for the facial skin, this brush is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I love it...it does not beat up my complexion but leaves it fresh an smooth.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the product but was hoping it was a bit smaller and softer.  For a complexion brush, it would seem like it should be as I expected.  But I&#x27;m using the brush even though it can&#x27;t get into areas around my nose that require a smaller brush.  Bernard Jensen products come highly recommended so I will probably order the smaller brush eventually.</li>
    <li> Very happy with how well it does!</li>
    <li> Love the product exactly what I offered thanks Susan very satisfied</li>
    <li> I thought I was buying a different brush the second time and they appear to be the same. I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Great product!!!  Delivered on time and I use it everyday!!!</li>
    <li> I appreciate this dry skin brush from Bernard Jensen.  It is like giving yourself a facial massage everyday.  Dry skin brushing is one of the healthiest activities you can do daily to help your skin.  It assists in circulation and in growing new healthy skin.  This brush is well made with natural components.  It is sturdy and easy to use.  I use it twice a day.  It is easy to take with you on any travel.  This is the second Bernard Jensen complexion brush that I have bought.  The first one I had over 13 years and lost it on a trip.  I couldn&#x27;t remember the name, but found it on Amazon.  I am thrilled to find the exact one I had lost.  I highly recommend this brush if you want to improve your skin.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the size. Most are too small for the purpose of facial cleansing. I am looking forward to see how the product holds up with continued use as far as the wood base is concerned. I also love the natural bristle vs synthetic.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive, effective, and durable.  The bristles have just the right amount of coarseness to be useful, without causing discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No complaints.</li>
    <li> Bristles were perfect for me; wanted a brush I could use on  my face with mild bar soap.  Works superbly for exfoliation and control of excess oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finely grained wood handle, though, was apparently not seasoned properly.  Even though I rinse the brush, shake it dry, and drain it in a dry place immediately after use, so that each morning it spends no more than 3-5 minutes wet, within the first week of use, the handle began to develop a crack, all the way through, along the drill line for a row of bristles.  One tuft of bristles will probably come loose before long, and the crack itself will, of course, eventually become yukky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Same bristle in a plastic handle would be a better choice.  I&#x27;ve have had wood  handle brushes in shower use before, and none split like this.  It would be five stars had the handle integrity lasted longer.</li>
    <li> This is a well made brush but not at all gentle. It would be good for heels and elbows but certainly not good for use on the face, etc. I am going to keep it because I think it will be excellent for cleaning jewelry, brushing suede jackets and shoes, etc. but certainly not good for the complexion.</li>
    <li> Love this brush!  Removes dry flaky skin on face safely!</li>
    <li> This is a really quality brush.  It is perfect for your face or other delicate parts of your body.  It feels wonderful.  You can buy this product with confidence.</li>
    <li> I love this little complexion brush! The bristles are just the right firmness/gentleness for delicate face and neck skin. I&#x27;ve been using the brush nightly for about 2 weeks and I&#x27;m noticing that my complexion is much brighter and that there are far fewer blackheads on my nose (a reap proble spot for me). I highly recommend the product.</li>
    <li> I thought the bristles were made of tampico fibre like other brushes from Bernard Jensen. But it seems animal hair, and the brush smells horrible. Not sure I can bear using it. Just realized that the wood handle also cracked twice, so I cannot even use it as shoe brush.</li>
    <li> The shipment arrived on time as agreed and was in perfect condition. I have already noticed a difference in my skin after 3 days of using it. The bristle are soft and brush fit in my hand.</li>
    <li> My routine is to wash my face with this brush in the morning. It wakes my face up in the nicest way</li>
    <li> The bristles seemed of decent quality, but the handle cracked along the entire base after the first use.  I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> I have tried other complexion brushes.  This product is superior in quality and useability. I purchased  the same brush from another supplier (still a great brush) , but. this supplier does a great job in quality control and sends the very best from the manufacturerI.  I bought two  to have for travel. I highly recommend this brush and specificity from this supplier.</li>
    <li> Love this....much better than the nylon bristle ones you sometimes find in CVS, etc. It is a little stiff at first...but if you rinse it with hot water before lathering it, it softens some...just use less pressure at first until the brush softens a little.  This is the best complexion brush I&#x27;ve ever used.  I tend to use it with either African black soap (raw), or Noxema, depending on the time of year and how dry my skin feels. If I use it with soap, I lather the brush...with Noxema, I spread the cream on my face and then lightly scrub with the wet brush. Wash it out with some soap and water after Noxema. I&#x27;m 56 years old and I haven&#x27;t a single blackhead or blemish...even when I examine my skin in a magnifying mirror!</li>
