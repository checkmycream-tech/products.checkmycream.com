<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> great product! get&#x27;s the job done fast....</li>
    <li> There are far better masques, but for 5xs the price. I use this one quite often since it&#x27;s so inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Literally the strongest conditioner I have ever used, period. I used it to repair my hair after a lot of bleaching by using putting it on my dry hair for 3 hours and then rinsing it out, once per week. Since the first application, my hair stopped tangling easily and breaking off in ponytail holders like it had been since I&#x27;d bleached and unfortunately managed to fry it. But now it&#x27;s back to normal. It does not seem to help with frizz, however, the same way other keratin products do. I think it is more for &amp;#34;damage repair&amp;#34; than &amp;#34;smoothing&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Buy this now! Works wonders!</li>
    <li> My hair was broken off badly and it was very weak from sew in after sew in. I used this product right after the Aphogee Shampoo for damaged hair and I saw a change IMMEDIATELY. When I blow dried my hair it felt so much stronger and I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Salon quality. I cannot, not have this. Once you try it, you will be reordering. My hair is completely fried, damaged due to heat and highlights. But this repairs alot of damage to my hair. After a minute, it changes your hair into soft and flowy strands. It makes my hair feel healthy again. I feel the more damaged your hair is might be best to leave it on longer. I also put a hair cap on and blow dry it to provide maximum results. I am excited when I&#x27;m bout to use this...makes my hair feel brand new. I have also had people ask me if I got my hair colored again. But I didn&#x27;t I just used this, it brings color back and rids the faded color. My highlights at the time were 4 months old, e[...] Anyway must buy!</li>
    <li> I heard about this product on YouTube and decided to give it a try. It is know my staple conditioner. My hair is so much stronger with the use of this product.Love it! :)</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading the good reviews and I was also looking for something to help maintain a keratin treatment (bkt). I&#x27;ve used this Reconstructor 4-5x now and it really hasn&#x27;t proven to be conditioning for my thick, wavy (and a lot) of hair. I&#x27;ve used more conditioner each subsequent time just to make sure I was using enough, but the results are the same.    I&#x27;m not thrilled about this product, but will keep it and use it up (as shipping it back will make this cost that much more in the end!)</li>
    <li> This product is just as good as the Aphogee 2 step protein reconstructive treatment...but better for two reasons, 1) it only takes 2 minutes and 2) it detangles and moisturizes like crazy. I have relaxed hair and I am willing to spend pretty much any amount of money for excellent hair care. I have purchased Kerastase and numerous other expensive hair treatments and conditioners, and they were good. But this product really stands out because it is so creamy,conditioning and detangling in addition to reconstructing. Typically, the protein reconstructors make your hair hard and you have to do a separate moisturizing treatment to bring the hair back into balance, but this product is great because it does all those things in one product...and in two minutes...very good stuff and a real bargain to boot.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife and it worked well on her hair. It provides protein to hair. Nice to have it.</li>
    <li> Definitely defined my curls but dried my hair out too much .</li>
    <li> All the aphogee products are amazing my hair is healthy strong and silky I would recommend</li>
    <li> I have long fine relaxed hair that was shedding and breaking a lot. This product smells great and my hair loves it. My hair feels so soft and smooth now and the breakage and shedding has reduced significantly. I would recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> So I got this on recommendations and I&#x27;m SO glad I did.  My hair is dyed, chemically straightened, and I&#x27;ve been swimming in a chlorinated pool.  I&#x27;d all but killed it, it was breaking and dry and I was thinking that short hair cut was in the future.    This is a lovely conditioning treatment that you feel working and after? Holy Moly! My hair is silky and soft, manageable and so much better feeling! Worth every penny!!</li>
    <li> I have African American hair so that you have a idea of how it works with certain hair types. First of all, the product does have a pleasant light coconut smell. I do not recommend you using it as deep conditioner- unless you want a deeper protein treatment. I would recommend you use it for just 2 minutes, especially if you are protein sensitive. I found my hair to be dry if I used it any longer. It has helped made my hair stronger-  but I would not over do it. In the end I do recomend it as a great product to rotate with when you feel your hair needs some strengthening but don&#x27;t have time to do a full on protein treatment or you don&#x27;t need a strong protein treatment.</li>
    <li> Having tried a lot of different products, my hair would still always end up crunchy and coarse.  this product REALLY made it soft, shiny and tamer.  I will continue to use this stuff, I am extremely happy with it!</li>
    <li> it didn&#x27;t make a significant change on my hair. pretty much the same as any oil from your kitchen cupboard. it made it a bit easy to comb my frizzy hair, nothing else. my hair is still dry and unhealthy and keeps breaking. I do not recommend it.</li>
    <li> It was already either opened or leaked in the box but I believe it was previously used or something because the cap of this bottle just cannot leak. It smelled really bad when I opened the box and the smell itself is not good either. Anyway only reason that I did not return is because I didn&#x27;t have time to resend this.</li>
    <li> This product is a good choice for those who blow dry and straighten their hair.  It conditioned my hair without making it oily.  Made my hair a little less frizzy and a bit softer.  I use this product as a daily conditioner because I have very thick unruly hair and it works well for that purpose. Shipping service was good.  Came back to Amazon to buy some more of it today.</li>
    <li> Caucasian hair. I have bleached my medium brown hair platinum blonde for years. I always just dealt with the extra stretchy rubberband texture my hair developed from overprocessing. Not anymore! This product is amazing.I recently bought this from Sally&#x27;s after reading some reviews. I have used it three times in the past two weeks. My breakage is significantly reduced. The weird rubber hair texture is gone.  I use it with the Aphogee damaged hair shampoo. It&#x27;s a perfect pair. I can run my fingers through my silky smooth hair. It is wonderful. I would totally recommend this product. I can&#x27;t believe i wasted so much time without it. It is essential for bleached or chemically processed hair. I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure where all these glowing reviews are coming from, but I am not at all impressed with this reconstructor.  I&#x27;ve used it several times and each time it leaves my hair feeling limp and tangled afterwards.  I much prefer the reconstructor that comes in the Optimum Care relaxer boxes which leaves my hair feeling thicker and smooth.  This stuff is going in the garbage.</li>
    <li> I currently have the ApHogee Serious Hair Care Kit with shampoo for damaged hair, protein treatment and balancing moisturizer. I am a moderate product junkie who is trying to remain loyal to a few working products and not purchase too many other products that take a long time to use up (and makes me wasteful trying to get rid of them). I used the serious hair care kit in its entirety off and on over 15 years ago. That was a long time ago and my hair was quite different then than it is today. I remember giving the protein treatment away to my aunt a long time ago. I also recall that the protein treatment back then smelled absolutely horrible - almost like sewage. The smell in today’s formula is much more tolerable and I am very glad for that. I have a review on the protein treatment separately.  While I don’t recall having a negative experience originally with the ApHogee line other than the protein treatment’s odor, I came back to it a couple of years ago to combat my problem with uncontrollable frizz. Over the years, my AA hair has become thinner and tends to get periodically frizzy beyond belief. In the last two years or so, I managed to successfully grow my hair from a perpetual SL to noticeable BSL by wearing wigs, taking better care of my hair underneath and ingesting supplements such as B-complex, multivitamins, iron and MSM (my diet is extremely poor, I will admit). I also reduced the amount of times I relaxed (went from 3-4x a year to 1-2 texlaxes). Although I achieved length, my hair wasn’t as full and thick as I would have liked. Getting it to that healthier state is now my focus.  I really do not like to spend the time needed to do the ApHogee hard-hat protein treatment (not that it is as long as some claim it to be, but hey, time is precious). I searched for alternate ways to get protein in my hair but in as little time as possible. In addition to ApHogee’s Pro-Vitamin Conditioning Spray and their Keratin and Green Tea Reconstructor, I purchased the 2-minute reconstructor (each at separate times). There are many hair care options out there (like really, just too many of them) but this one with ApHogee is budget-friendly and relatively easy to find at most beauty supply stores. It is my hope to eventually use the entire line consistently in order to achieve better hair health.  Thus far, I have used the reconstructor once since reinstating use of the ApHogee line. A few weeks after my relaxer this past April, I used the vitamin spray and keratin green tea reconstructor after a wash and straightened my hair with a flat-iron after blow-drying (not bone straight, as I am not really proficient with the flat iron). On the next wash, I used the vitamin spray, 2-minute reconstructor and followed it up with Dominican conditioner 10-En-1 (I use various conditioners and am not loyal to any particular one, but this was the choice for that day). I sat with the 10-En-1 under the dryer for 15-20 minutes.  So, how does the product work? Yes, I kind of went off on a tangent there. I will first say that I washed my hair without properly combing out the set curls beforehand. I should have learned from a previous time that this leads to unnecessary tangling and knots. I was simply being hair-lazy. But, in spite of that, the ApHogee reconstructor still detangled my hair relatively well. I notice some reviewers use the reconstructor product alone but just to be safe, I used the10-En-1 for moisture after rinsing out the reconstructor. As a side note, I am not really versed on the whole moisture-protein balance principle.  Afterward, my hair was noticeably conditioned, smooth and reasonably detangled. Unlike some, I did not seem to experience the minimal two hairs or less breakage when combing, but I will say that was partially my fault for not properly detangling earlier. There was most likely shed hair in my comb combined with the hair from tangles. I wasn’t expecting a complete miracle from one use, but in the end, my hairwas extremely soft and easy to comb.  The following week, my hair appeared fuller and curled pretty nicely (with rollers, no heat styling). I will continue to use the ApHogee hair care line until it stops working for me as some products tend to do after repeated use. I have used Fantasia’s IC Reconstructor in the past which also works well, but I do not care for its fragrance (it may have changed since, I do not know). The ApHogee Reconstructor’s scent does not bother me at all. It is light and not overpowering.  In sum, I highly recommend ApHogee’s 2-Minute Reconstructor!</li>
    <li> Product as described.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely amazing!  It instantly stopped the usual shedding while blowdrying.  Usually when I blow dry after washing i have lots of hairs on the bathroom floor.  I washed my hair with non ahogee products then put this greatness in my hair for only two minutes.  While rinsing it out my hair instanly felt soft.  I blow dried it and only had 4 strands of hair vs close to 50 stands of hair on the floor.  I love this stuff.  While straightening my hair also felt a lot stronger.  This product is a must have.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried this actual bottle but I bought the product because my sister recommended it and said just after one wash she saw a lot less hair on her bathroom floor. I look forward to stronger, healthier hair. (we&#x27;re Black and lovely ;))</li>
    <li> left it in for 10 minutes. It did soften my hair a bit and made a lot of my curls come back. My hair did look a lot better and wasn&#x27;t dry after using this, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it stopped breakage in its track. I&#x27;ve only used it one time, and yes there was less hair fall out, which is good. but I&#x27;ll give it a few more works before claiming it stopped the breakage but from what I can tell it has already helped a good amount. Great buy. can&#x27;t decide if I should use it every week as a conditioner or once every two weeks, while deep conditioning with palmers on the weeks I don&#x27;t use this</li>
    <li> I colored my hair and it got too ashy and dull.  I almost colored again,but instead bought the shampoo and conditioner.  I left it on for about an hour since my hair was very dull and ashy looking, it was suppose to be blond.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it took  a lot of the dullness away and the dark ashy color.  I now will wait to color again when my roots show.&lt;br /&gt;I am not easily impressed, but this conditioner is worth every penny, buy the shampoo too, it goes far, a little lathers up nicely and it smells very nice.&lt;br /&gt;It made my hair feel and look as if I had gotten a treatment at the salon.</li>
    <li> My natural hair is both fine and low density. I never color, straighten or even blow dry my hair but it is quite weak since it is finer than other hair. I decided to try this out after noticing that my hair wasn&#x27;t gaining in length but wasn&#x27;t breaking off either. I decided split ends are likely the culprit and I just wanted to make my hair overall stronger to see if there would be a changing in shedding and quality of hair. This product definitely worked. Before my hair was normal. Definitely not in need of protein nor damaged in anyway however it frizzy because once I used this product it felt better. Better than normal. Stronger than normal. Immediately I deep conditioned and then put it in single braids. I shed almost no hair. Probably around 30 strands. Which was unusual. Then, as I was braiding I felt no hairs break. Like zero hairs at all. Then I noticed the hair felt SOOO sleek and the ends felt just healthy. Will definitely be using this once a month to maintain such nice feeling hair. I would recommend just letting it sit in your hair while you clean your body and then just rinsing it if you are someone who doesn&#x27;t do anything that would damage their hair but still want to see the effects of protein on it.</li>
    <li> I loved this stuff. it puts all the goodness back into my hair lol you only need it on a seldom basis, you dont want a keratin overload. When im not doing my deep conditioner with olive oil, i use this instead.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years and I love it! This is great for giving my hair the protein that it needs. I find myself using this every two months or so. I use a deep Moisturizing conditioner weekly.  Do not use this too often!!  Too much protein can be just as bad as not enough protein in the hair.</li>
    <li> these products didn&#x27;t do anything different to my hair. I got almost all of them and none of them is good.</li>
    <li> It was a good midprice product to help stop damage. If your hair needs protein then this is a product u might wanna buy</li>
    <li> this is great if your hair lacks protein.protein strenghtens the hair but you must have a balance of protein and moisture because too much of one will create inbalance and result in breakage. i self relaxed with dr miracle recently and started experiencing breakage, i was at loss at what to do because my hair doesnt break for no reason, after reading some reviews i bought this at sally&#x27;s and just finished trying this.&lt;br /&gt;before: couldnt do anything without seeing broken hairs anywhere, couldnt comb, run fingers through, nuthin&lt;br /&gt;now: i was able to detangle comb even pull on it with no breakage, this stuff works&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i do recommend following the instructions on the bottle though, i  thought my hair was particularly weak so i left it on for 15 mins with a shower cap but some ppl&#x27;s hair is extra sensitive to protein and might not  be able to handle it, know what your hair likes and i hope this helps :)</li>
    <li> This has literally stopped breakage completely for me. I was having quite a bit of breakage from my relaxed ends but this halted this completely. Would recommend this into anyone&#x27;s healthy hair regimen for a light protein treatment.</li>
    <li> I have chemically straightened hair that is now I&#x27;m letting grow out. Since my last straightening my hair started falling out and breaking a lot (I do believe the stylist ironed the hair for way too long). Anyway, I had been using another product that cost me over $100 for the shampoo &amp; conditioner, and once it ran out, I figured I&#x27;d give this a try, and boy, am I glad I did! This product gives me much better results than my earlier conditioner ever did. I also use the Aphogee Pro-Vitamin Leave-In Conditioner when I&#x27;m not using this (I usually wash my hair 2-3 times a week). I&#x27;d certainly be buying this product again and again.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Been using it for years. It&#x27;s worth the price, also shipped pretty quickly. It makes my previously bleached hair feel soft and healthier. Love the smell ! I always get the biggest size because I have a lot of hair and this lasts longer! Yay :)</li>
    <li> To start off, I have bleached and I mean bleached (multiple times) hair; and, not only is my hair bleached but naturally it&#x27;s unruly, dry, brittle, hard to brush, and very, very frizzy. fried, dried, and laid to the side- a deep conditioner at a salon does nothing to help it. At a salon a keratin treatment (which is supposed to last 3-4 months) will keep it pretty and manageable for a week. yes its that bad. This is much less expensive and makes my hair soft, manageable, removes the frizz, and makes it easy to brush. It makes it look healthy like the keratin treatment in the salon does!!!!!!! the thing is since my hair is so fried that i use it every two days and sleep with it in my hair, but it works and NOTHING else does without making my hair extremely greasy. This is the only product I have found that is worth leaving a review!</li>
    <li> When I opened it noticed that the pills were cracked like damaged. I dont think that is normal or that I should use them like that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product for my damaged hair because I had bleached my hair in order to achieve a vibrant purple color and so far I have to say that it has definitely made my hair very soft but my hair wasn&#x27;t dry or fried by bleach. My hair was gummy and elasticy when it was wet and I needed an intense keratin treatment for my hair and this sadly didn&#x27;t fulfill my needs. I&#x27;ve left it on for two minutes but I felt like it didn&#x27;t do much other than make my hair softer so I would usually leave it in my hair for an hour or so and still my hair is still elasticy when its wet but very soft when dry. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just that my hair is too damaged to be repaired or not but unfortunately I won&#x27;t be buying this again. I will probably be buying the ApHogee Two Step Protein instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is that for ME, it didn&#x27;t meet my expectation but it might be different for others.</li>
    <li> this product is amazing, i just used this product twice and my hair looks healthy and shinny again, i love it</li>
    <li> I absolutely feel enhancement&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels stronger and healthier</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the 2 Minute Reconstructor for over 2 years, so I&#x27;ve rated it a 5 Star product because it is effective in a short period of time. I saw a difference after my first use, so much that I proactively purchase the larger size. This product is a staple keeper because it stopped my breakage and encouraged curls to form in my usually zigzag or straighter hair in the front and on the sides.  My curls are now defined and closure in pattern! I shampoo my hair in 4-6 braids in the shower, take each down one by on and add the 2 Minute Reconstructor, followed by rinsing in braids again. I always deep condition afterwards under my steamer or heater, let it cool and then cool water rinse. I braid my hair to prevent single strand knots and tangles. This product is fantastic! I use it every wash, which is 1-3 weeks a part and based on my time.</li>
    <li> wow i used this one time and left on for 5 minutes because my hair breaks easily after a relaxer, even without a relaxer. After I used it I did a quick rinse about 30 secondes, not completely trying to removed the leftover proteins, etc. After i towel dried it my hair got baby soft I was excited :)and it feels super strong too Im waiting for my hair to get longer and stronger after using this product !</li>
    <li> I have been using this conditioner for more than 5 years now and I have to say that it has more than delivered on the promises of breakage reduction. I wear my hair relaxed and tend to stretch my relaxers between 12-16 weeks and this treatment being a mild protein gives me the ability to do the relaxer stretches with virtually no breakage. I would treat my hair with it once a week until just 1 week before my relaxer when I would use a much stronger protein treatment like Dudley&#x27;s DRC28. In the interim, Aphogee 2 Keratin Minute Reconstructor works like a charm to keep the protein bonds in my hair strands nice and fortified. I love this reconstructor more than all the other reconstructors I have used in the past because it does not make my hair hard at all. Mind you, I still follow it up with some kind of moisturizing conditioner to balance out the protein.</li>
    <li> I have 3c/4a hair, been using this product for a couple years now.  I&#x27;ve been natural for about 7 years but never did protein treatments, and then wondered why I kept getting so many split ends and breakage -___-.  I used conditioning products all the time, but my hair wasn&#x27;t retaining any type of moisturizer - even water took a few minutes to really get through my hair shafts!  It was so bad.  Once I figured out the importance of protein treatments, I knew I would need something quick that I can incorporate easily into my weekly washing routine, because I have neither the patience or the time to regularly do a whole separate protein treatment routine in addition to washing.  I browsed all the protein treatment products at my local Sally&#x27;s and decided to give this a shot first because it was the quickest to use lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well this product most certainly fit the bill!  Not only do I have less problems with split ends, my hair retains moisture so much better and my corkscrew coils are so well defined after ^_^!  I end up using less product for conditioning/moisturizing and my hair is overall more manageable.  The moisture retention benefit sticks for two weeks without another treatment, but I do it weekly to keep up definition and reduce frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a couple reviews saying that this stuff made their hair stiff or break off, which was a little bothersome.  This is a PROTEIN treatment product, not a conditioner, not a shampoo.  It is not designed to take the place of either of these, and it will make your hair stiff - that&#x27;s what protein does. If you don&#x27;t moisturize/condition your hair after using this, your hair will be dry and more prone to breakage than usual.  So use the product as instructed and hydrate and condition your hair immediately after!  I love this stuff, it&#x27;s done wonders for the manageability and texture of my hair.  I It&#x27;s affordable, easy to use, and I recommend it to anyone with African American or highly texturized hair.</li>
    <li> I love this! It helped heal my hair after I bleached the hell out of it and it also made my hair grow very fast!</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and was having lots of split ends and losing of hairs.  I got this thinking it would just be a miracle.  While it is a decent conditioner, I havent seen the results that people are raving about in these reviews.  I also got the green tea reconstructor, but again, nothing to write home about in my opinion...</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this product. I am a guy &amp; had a phase where my hairs were breaking a lot. I got this at the recommendation of an ex. Fixed the breakage in a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> I have 3C/2B curls that i just got highlighted and my hair was severely damaged. I use this as my regular conditoner in the shower now and i can tell the difference after only 3 washes. This stuff is great! Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have always had thin fragile curly hair that was (and is) super porous-if you took a strand and pulled it between two fingers you could feel the &amp;#34;bumps&amp;#34; but my hair was always long and pretty manageable. TILL  my darn thirties and dying my little &amp;#34;skunk&amp;#34; patch and occasional gray here and there has left me with short hair due to breakage from coloring and oh so bummed. I didn&#x27;t want short hair but I also didn&#x27;t want gray hair. I had to choose between the two so I dye my grays!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just recently this product came into my life and it is my HG (holy grail) product! My hair is actually growing and my ringlets look beautiful again and not frizzy. I know i totally sound like a infomercial but I cant help it I am over the moon! I mean I may not be to the length of my youth (past my bra strap near my behind) but i am well beyond my shoulders. A year ago I would have never thought i would see that length again.  I recommend this product 1000%</li>
    <li> This product is really good not only it smells delicious like coconut but it leaves the hair shinny and very soft. Especially for relaxed hair like mines its the best treatment ive had.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;v seen all of the rave reviews of this product, and honestly I&#x27;v been using this a month and can&#x27;t really tell a difference. It smells nice it just doesn&#x27;t do anything. I get better results from Hask Placenta products, and they are way cheaper. And I trusted the reviews so I purchased it.</li>
    <li> If you have chemically treated hair, Two Minute Reconstructor is a must have! I am a skeptic and always expect products to disappoint me.  This is one, however, does EXACTLY what it says it will do. Just one application of Two Minute Reconstructor instantly strengthened my hair and subsequent uses have eliminated hair shedding.     Since this is a mild protein treatment, it can be used weekly. I follow the directions on the package and am ALWAYS pleased with the results. Two Minute Reconstructor will continue to be a part of my hair regimen as the price is very reasonable and because a little product goes a long way. A great value and a fabulous product!</li>
    <li> This stuff worked great. After the very first use I noticed the strength and moisture it added to my hair.</li>
    <li> It works! I am using it once a week and my hair are smooth and shiny again!</li>
    <li> Very nice, has a slightly &amp;#34;medical&amp;#34; smell in a way, like when fluoride treatments are flavored like candy. Other than that, great product, really helped my bleached to death hair. Follow this with a good conditioner.</li>
    <li> I bought this at Sally&#x27;s because I just happened to be there one day and saw the Aphogee line. I think out of all the Aphogee products I have, this one takes first place! It does a good job of freezing my breakage than the two step protein treatment does, and it smells really awesome. I like to use this as a protein deep conditioner. I just shampoo/wet my hair, towel dry it, and apply a fair amount of the conditioner to my hair. Then I put on my conditioning cap and sit under the dryer for about 10-15 minutes. The bottle says to apply it for 2-5 minutes, but I&#x27;d like to do it my own way. After I rinse the conditioner out my hair feels nice and soft!     **DON&#x27;T FORGET TO FOLLOW THIS WITH A MOISTURIZING CONDITIONER...YOU CAN USE THE APHOGEE BALANCING MOISTURIZER OR YOUR OWN CONDITIONER**    I highly recommend this to anyone who is experiencing moderate breakage. Ive been using the Aphogee line (Shampoo for damaged hair, protein two-step, this conditioner, green tea/keratin reconstructor, balancing moisturizer, and leave-in spray) for about 4 months now and I&#x27;ve noticed little breakage than ever before! I will probably be stocking up on this after I finish this bottle (which I&#x27;ve had since January &#x27;11 now and i&#x27;m only halfway through it).</li>
    <li> First of all let me start by saying i am a black young Lady with relaxed hair. It&#x27;s been seven weeks since i last relaxed my hair and it was starting to break so bad that i stopped combing it and i was only wearing a cap. I was in search of a deep conditioner that would stop the breakage and keep the hair nice until i relax it in a weeks time. I must say, i am overly satisfied with the results i got from this product. I washed my hair with DOO GRO shampoo and then i applied the APHOGEE two minute re constructor and left it on for about 40 mins. While rinsing it out hair was coming out from my head worst than its ever been. For a moment there i was scared. Anyway, after rinsing it out completely, i towel dried it then, I put some OLIVE OIL heat protector in it and blow dried it on low heat. After doing this, my hair was super dry. I applied some OLIVE OIL moisturizer to it, comb and brushed it gentle and  i wore a wig on my head (not for any reason though, just felt like it). Three hours later, i took of my wig off and BOOOOOM a miracle..... my hair which was filled with growth was silky smooth and felt good. I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO EVERYONE.</li>
    <li> i love this treatment</li>
    <li> Awesome product that restores hair&#x27;s elasticity! I have relaxed hair and this is a lifesaver, I left it in for about 3-4 mins with a plastic cap on. Very very happy!</li>
    <li> This worked great the first 2 months of using. Then . . . breakage. As the bottle says, once hair is healthy, STOP USING. Please do yourself this favor. Great if used once or twice, maybe three times, then moisturize, moisturize and stop using. I&#x27;m not happy about the breakage but I fault myself for not stopping use as directed. The first time I used it my hair felt amazing! The second time, stronger. After the 3rd, breakage. I&#x27;ll be deep conditioning and moisturizing to restore my hair from this drying and breaking brought on by this product. Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 100% natural, and I sometimes flat iron my hair and always get a little heat damage to my ends since they are the oldest parts of my hair. I use this and my ends feel amazing and full of proteins. I love the effect it gives my hair after me abusing my strands.</li>
    <li> Great product and service.</li>
    <li> I have African American chemically relaxed hair. About 3 years ago one of my friends said, \\&quot;You wear you&#x27;re hair everyday; invest in it.\\&quot; I spent the next 2 years or so reviewing hair forums and trying new products. I was told to beware of dimethicones, sulfates, and alcohols. In a lot of ways it&#x27;s difficult to avoid those and have healthy &amp; nice smelling hair.   Of all the products I&#x27;ve tried, this one is simple the best! It stopped my hair breakage and I don&#x27;t have split ends anymore. My hair is the longest it has ever been in my entire life. I use this with [[ASIN:B001DKGJQU 100% Pure Emu Oil (8 oz.)]] (to stimulate hair growth) and [[ASIN:B0032VFB5I Organix Rejuvenating Shampoo, Cherry Blossom Ginseng, 13 oz.]] (smells amazing).   In sum, my hair is longer, stronger, and smells nice every day.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I had bleached my hair and I wanted a good hair treatment. The ingredient list posted is NOT THE SAME as the one on the bottle... I&#x27;ve attaches two pics of the list on the bottle. Basically, there are cheaper ingredients in the real thing such as mineral oil.... Compare for yourself.</li>
    <li> Really great reconstructing conditioner for even the most damaged hair. This product is absolutely amazing. It makes your hair so soft and healthy and absolutely does not weigh it down. I am thrilled to have found this product and will absolutely buy it again.</li>
    <li> If it was not for this product I would have no hair left. Its a fantastic product and I look forward to trying their other products.  A bad bleach job was done to my hair, I almost lost all my hair but this product saved me.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m european with very curly hair from birth, after bleaching tens of times to get my hair white blonde my curl pattern was almost ruined, and it dried looking scraggly and shed a lot- especially when wet. I found conditioning made it frizzy and any serums or my usually reliable IC hair polisher weighed it down. I was sick of trying UK drugstore products, and was considering cutting it all off-until I saw a review of this on YouTube and thought I&#x27;d give a protein treatment a go after never even hearing of it before, but I was unsure because all of the reviews i found were on afro hair.&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong to be unsure! it practically restored my hair to its natural state. I left it on for an hour after bleaching the first time, once more a few days later and then two weeks later for an hour each time (it says 2-5 but i could tell that wouldnt suffice) and now its soft, the curls are defined and its shiny and lovely. Breakage is still happening when wet but MUCH less hair, and i will never have to leave it on for an hour again!&lt;br /&gt;This product works universally, if youre considering chopping off your hair then PLEASE give this a go! You will be amazed if your hair was in a state similar to mine.</li>
    <li> Good - What it is&lt;br /&gt;This is a quick protein boost for your hair that you can use fairly often. If you&#x27;re experiencing mild breakage, this is a way to get your hair into shape quickly. If you are experiencing moderate breakage, using this on a schedule is a great way to gradually improve the quality of your hair without accidentally overdoing it. Furthermore, plenty of people use this without following up with a DC and retain softness. I personally have never done protein without a moisture DC immediately after, so I can&#x27;t comment on that.&lt;br /&gt;Bad - What it isn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;If you want a quick MEDIUM/LARGE protein boost, you&#x27;re better off using ORS Mayo or perhaps that 2 Step. I&#x27;ve seen what the 2 step can do to people, so I won&#x27;t be trying it. At any rate, I would recommend this to anyone who sometimes needs more protein in their hair diet, which is quite a lot of people.</li>
    <li> I wish I had read all the reviews before I bought this. I used this on a weekly basis for the last two months and could not understand why my hair was so dry and breaking. Yes my hair was healthy, thick and transitioning. This product should be used with caution if your hair is not dry or damaged. I thought my hair was moisturized and did not realize I did not have the right moisture protein balance. I used this in the shower and not under dryer. Do not use heat on hair. Cover with shower cap. Hair was tangled and brittle after rinsing out, even to the point where it was matted at times. So everyone&#x27;s hair is different. My personal experience was that I used it too much and too often. I will be shelving this for a while at least for a month or so. My experience had me really seconding guess the natural process, was tempted to relax. Thought transitioning hair couldn&#x27;t possibly be this dry, brittle and breaking. So if your hair is healthy this is not for your.....as the bottle does say stop using once hair is healthy (think I missed that). Btw bought organics hair mayonnaise and I couldn&#x27;t be more happy. Hair is stretched, moisturized, and not tangled. Proceed with caution and make sure you are using it for the right reasons, as it works for many, just not me.</li>
    <li> I could cry I&#x27;m so excited I found this reconstructor- I feel like I&#x27;ve tried every product under the sun to help my hair (leave-in conditioners, argan oil, redken products, tigi products, etc), and this was the FIRST thing that actually made a difference to my brittle, breaking, tangled and just totally f-ed up hair. I always had super long naturally dirty blonde hair, which I&#x27;ve been dying for years with the lightest possible blonde of nice and easy haircolor. Of course I was bad and usually never did just my roots, but dyed the whole thing. Everyone told me not to, but the dye actually made my thin hair look better, thicker and a better texture. I never had any problems with this until I recently made the bad decision to chop my hair off and have actually had to start using styling tools to make it look good- curling iron, straightener, hair dryer. Well this caught up up to me and my hair started becoming HARD. I couldn&#x27;t brush it when I got out the shower unless I put some kind of product in it, and then once it dried (which it took an oddly long time to do), the hair would dry both hard and crazy wonky- not straight as it usually did. Trying to brush through the hard hair to make it straight only succeeded in breaking the hair right off, as it had become fragile and brittle. So now I have sections of hair on my head that are broken off at odd lengths. Like I said, I&#x27;ve tried everything to help over the past few months and thought I was basically screwed for life. Argan oil helped a little for me to brush it but didn&#x27;t heal anything, and I was usually just wearig my hair in a ponytail to hide it. My coworker suggested Aphogee and I thought I&#x27;d try one more product. I picked it up from Sallys,  and then followed the directions- towel dried my hair after washing, applied liberally and let it sit for about 3 minutes (was scared to do any longer after some of the reviews on here). Then followed with a moisturizing conditioner just in case (I used Nexxus ultimate moisture and let it sit for about 10 minutes). O M G. I didn&#x27;t expect anything, but after I got out of the shower, I could actually run my fingers through my hair. I can&#x27;t tell you the last time I was able to do that!!! My hair actually dried SOFT and looks thicker, feels so much softer, isn&#x27;t brittle, and even my color looks better- my blonde was looking brassy and had a weird sheen, now it looks bright and healthy and natural. I can actually brush through my hair with nothing snapping off. I used the reconstructor for the second time last night (didn&#x27;t follow with a moisturizer this time) and my hair is even better. I can tell there&#x27;s still a few damaged areas in the front but I&#x27;ll keep using until those get better. It sounds stupid but I always loved my hair and I was so depressed over it these past few months. I am so incredibly happy I tried Aphogee. TRY IT!!!!!</li>
    <li> This product has a strong coconut odour. It&#x27;s quite moisturizing and I used this instead of a conditioner after shampooing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way and one bottle lasts me a long time - more than 8 months. I did not feel this product has reconstructed my hair or made my hair stronger structurally. In fact, I need to clean the bathroom floor after every use so that the floor would not be slippery. I won&#x27;t repurchase this product simply because it is like a conditioner cum hair mask, giving hair more moisturizing effect instead of building the hair strands stronger which is what I hope to have.</li>
    <li> This is so much easier to use than the Aphogee Two-Step Protein Treatment! And it actually smells okay. The two-step treatment is messy, smelly and super annoying and time consuming to use. So glad I found this as an alternative. My hair has been severely damaged from bleach and using the two minute treatment occasionally when I shower is so much easier than using the two step treatment (which is recommended for use every 6-8 weeks).</li>
    <li> It worked wonders on bringing my heat damaged natural hair back to its original curl pattern. It also made my hair super soft</li>
    <li> Ehhh I thought it would fix my hair better. It&#x27;s alright.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a light protein treatment to use weekly or biweekly and read about this one. It works great I left it in my hair for about 15 minutes and rinsed and my hair felt amazing and strong! I&#x27;ll deff keep using this and switching it up with the Organic Root Stimulator Hair Mayonnaise</li>
    <li> If you have naturally curl, fine hair, this is not for you. It made my hair drier than it already was after using it for a week. It smells like suntan lotion and I think that is the problem. I have never been able to use anything with coconut in it because it dries my hair out really bad. If you cant use products like that, don&#x27;t buy it. It might work great for some one else but not for me.</li>
    <li> Amazing! My hair has become so much stronger from using this either weekly or bi-weekly. I will continue to use and recommend to others</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m guessing what I got is FAKE! I&#x27;m now contemplating whether to shop on amazon for hair products bec the ones I got including this seems to not work. Only the AUSSIE 3 min miracle and Pureology worked with my hair. I have fine, thin hair with bleached damaged ends. My roots are healthy though. Whenever I use this product, my hair becomes rough at the ends and is hard to manage. Also looks so dry and course!! I will never repurchase this product!!!</li>
    <li> Best thing made in a bottle.</li>
    <li> My hair breaks a lot if I dont use this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I know I have it always in my house!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;try it if you hair is too think and breaks!</li>
    <li> The formula&#x27;s has changed. It has mineral oil as the third ingredient beware</li>
    <li> Boo...This did nothing for my hair...even after several attempts.</li>
    <li> I definitely saw some moisture repair with this treatment, however it didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling silky after I rinsed it out.  I had to leave it on for five minutes not two just to get the moisture repair and that&#x27;s with doing the treatment twice a week.  It smells good and it will help restore lightly heat damaged hair.</li>
    <li> Would give 100 stars if I could... This is the ONLY conditioner that doesn&#x27;t turn my very dry + sun-damaged + baby-fine blonde hair to stringy a few hours into the day, like every other conditioner or non-shampoo hair product I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a little almost every day depending how dry my hair feels (since the last ~3 months) and so far no build-up or issues, tho I do cleanse with clarifying shampoo every week or 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally, I only go for natural products, but I don&#x27;t even care what&#x27;s in this cuz it makes my hair so soft and beautiful.  Also, I despise perfumes and this has a very light and not unpleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on the other reviews, it&#x27;s kinda amazing that Aphogee works for so many different hair types.  I hope this company never changes the formula or goes out of business!!!  From these other reviews, I just realized it&#x27;s supposed to be used under a hair dryer, but I never read the instructions - I use it like conditioner and don&#x27;t really fuss with my hair outside of daily showering...  I have probably tried dozens of different conditioners over the years and there is no comparison to the results I get from Aphogee.  And, I just noticed how insanely inexpensive it is.  Wow.</li>
    <li> I found that when I used this conditioner the first time, I was not impressed. However, I went to the salon and my stylist used it on my hair along with another product. After sitting under the hot dryer, my hair was very crunchy and hard (like a sculpture), and I was skeptical to how it was going to turn out. After she rinsed my hair, it was nice, silky, smooth, and healthier. I have had braids in my hair for a couple of years now due to weaves/extensions and am doing alot of healthy things to my hair to bring it back to life after being hidden for so long. This treatment is doing wonders to making my hair feel immediately stronger and like others said I see hardly any broken hairs when before I was nearly in tears from seeing so many of them after washing. There are lots of reviews of this product on forums like black haircare and long hair care forum (google search), and I have found videos on youtube where black women with healthy, long hair swear by this product. It has been a lifesaver for me, and depending on how your hair feels, it can be used weekly or even bi-weekly for hair that is more damaged. After my visit at the hair salon, I used this product in the shower, then sat under the dryer for 5-10 minutes and let it get a little hard. It didn&#x27;t get nearly as hard as when I was at my hair stylist, but I think this is because her dryer is more expensive and alot hotter than my home-use one. After, I washed out the conditioner, and this is the only product that I have found so far to give my dead hair a SALON silky feel. My friends are even telling me that my hair is looking thicker, and I have only used the product once. I also have alot of new growth now which is great because this means my hair is growing like weeds. I literally thank God for this product and implore anyone who has any questions about its use to google those forums to find out more information and help. I cannot wait to use the shampoo and other products as I heard they are really good aswell.     FYI my hair type is very fine and fragile. It cannot take alot of beating, color, stretching, heat, pony tailing, anything.</li>
    <li> My hair dosent get any soft with this not even if a leave it up to 10 minutes and even masage it... what is true is that when i blow dry my hair after using it my hair looks stronger but llack of shine...</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner !!!! In fact I have to order another one because my husband won&#x27;t stop using it now my friend comes over my house and uses it lol it really works</li>
    <li> I have fine and wavy hair that&#x27;s always been highly prone to knotting, split ends, and breakage -- even from something as basic as brushing it out. ApHogee is the first keratin treatment I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;m blown away by how much softness, shine, and body I can see after just one application. I&#x27;ve purchased many pricey hair masks, deep conditioners, and pure argan and coconut oil products to improve my texture. Not one of them delivered this kind of result. Either my hair had volume but unpleasant dryness, or looked moist and shiny but totally limp. Best of all, compared to most specialty hair products, it&#x27;s fairly cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve got hair that tends to break, frizz, and look flat and lifeless, this is probably the treatment you&#x27;ve been spending a lot of time and money searching for without success.</li>
    <li> I just washed my hair. Received this product in the mail yesterday . I have used this product several times in the past, I always bought it at Sally&#x27;s. Long story short, the bottle of \\&quot;Aphogee keratin 2 minute reconstructor\\&quot; contained LOTION! To add insult to injury, it was a foul smelling CHEAP lotion! Next time if you want to deceive your customers, use a better quality lotion like Nivea or even Johnson&#x27;s baby lotion! Needless to say I will NEVER order from this vendor again. I have logged a complaint, and am now awaiting refund. I would definitely think twice before ordering from this unscrupulous vendor!</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it claims it will do and that is to strengthen!</li>
    <li> This stuff really works. I&#x27;m transitioning to natural and haven&#x27;t had a perm in 9 months. It&#x27;s hard styling my hair bc I have 2 different textures (natural &amp; relaxed). When I do wear it down, it looks as if my hair is falling out because the bottom portion is thin from the chemicals of the relaxed hair &amp; the top portion is thick. I could easily go to the beautician to get a blowout so it won&#x27;t show my 2 different hair textures. But I wanted to do the blowout at home without having to always spend money to see a beautician.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friend from work have been natural for 2 1/2 years and she get her hair done every 2-3 weeks. She told me about her beautician using the Keratin treatment. She said that its a good conditioner giving her hair volume. She also said that her straighten hair from the Keratin treatment last long. So I went to Sally&#x27;s Beauty store to find a good Keratin treatment to do a blowout. The clerk recommend the Aphogee Keratin 2 Minute Reconstructor. She said that it was a really good product. After reading about the product, I saw that it have amino acids, botanical oils and vitamins in it to restore elasticity and softness to dry, brittle hair. And how it penetrates and repairs damage caused by chemical services, styling and heat. What got to me was when the product mention this: \\&quot;Even bleached, permed or relaxed hair feels healthy again.\\&quot; My goal was to do a blowout where you cannot tell that I&#x27;m transitioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying the product, I&#x27;ve notice that my hair was silky straight and had volume to it. It look as if I&#x27;ve gotten a fresh perm and can&#x27;t tell that I have 2 different hair textures. I recommend this product for those that want to do their own blowouts and for those that&#x27;s struggling to style their hair with 2 different textures in the transition process.</li>
    <li> This is a great product if you are transitioning from being permed to natural and your hair needs protein and replenishment.  Use it once a weak on weak, broken, stripped, and damaged hair and you will notice a difference right away.  The proteins really stick, but don&#x27;t leave it on too long or it will cause stiffness.</li>
    <li> I am a african american female with Type 3C curly hair..i recently bleached my hair a month ago and lost my curl pattern. I&#x27;ve tried everything under the sun to get my curls back and my hair from feeling like straw with no help. I saw this product on youtube videos and took a chance and ordered it.  I literally just got the product yesterday and used it for the 1st time. INSTANT RESULTS!!! About 85% of my curl pattern came back and my hair is once again soft and bouncy. I&#x27;m so pleased with this product and will continue to use it for a few more weeks until all of my curl pattern has returned! I cannot stress how awesome this product was. Easy to use...just perfect for my colored hair! I may try the 2-step treatment as well...</li>
    <li> Wish I could find a product that worked miracles for my hair but that ain&#x27;t easy, anyway this product is real good.  It does help my hair a lot.  This is the second bottle I buy.</li>
    <li> Super amazing!  Miracle Product! Definitely will now be a part of my stable of products.  But listen to what everyone says, only use up to the point where it fixes your product.  NOT AN EVERYDAY conditioner!  But I will search for and find this line&#x27;s everyday conditioner and get it here.  It strengthened my hair to the point where it stopped breaking off.  A lot less hair in my comb. Wow, I used to fill it up after shampooing.  This is truly a great product.  DON&#x27;T CHANGE  A THING.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m borderline pleased with this product. When I first tried it, my keratin straightened color-treated thick hair was so soft afterwards. It looked amazingly healthy. But a couple months later, I&#x27;ve retried it again and it doesn&#x27;t give me the same results as it initially did:( It&#x27;s a great product to try and does work, but maybe what others are saying is true- it stops working after you use it for a while.&lt;br /&gt;p.s this is also available at  Sally&#x27;s</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter.  She has long hair, but her sides tend to get very thin, and after a lot of coloring, she experiences breakage.  However, after using this once a week for three weeks, the sides of her hair are visible thicker and longer.  We did not purchase the shampoo (as is recommended on the bottle), and it worked anyway.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Made my hair so brittle and took away all the shine from it after only one use. I won&#x27;t ever let it touch my hair again.</li>
    <li> Keeps especially fine hair in good condition....</li>
    <li> This is a very good product. If it doesn&#x27;t do anything for you, then your hair simply dont need keratin and I&#x27;d suggest not to use keratin products at all but to try something with different ingredients.&lt;br /&gt; I have very damaged highlighted hair. A year ago I was swearing by Apogee. It was the only treatment that was making my hair look great. Then I noticed it stopped working for me. I started swearing by coconut oil then. Half a year later coconut stopped working. I used to apply it for a min before washing hair and it was working wonders. Now I leave the oil overnight and see no difference. This time I realized that an egg yolk (protein) makes my hair look brand new. I damp my hair, apply 1 yolk for a min, shampoo, use heavy conditioner and get complements every time I do it. In the mean time, highly rated Macadamia oil mask and PM wild ginger don&#x27;t make any difference.&lt;br /&gt;So after all, it meaningless to say that Apogee is a bad treatment if you simply don&#x27;t need it. Apparently, something is going on in our bodies and it reflects on the hair. Just find what your hair needs at the moment.</li>
    <li> I have been trying this natural thing for over 6 months now. I have long hair down my back and My hair started to break off, I&#x27;ve tried so many different shampoos. Aphogee is the best ever!! I use this every time after I shampoo my hair with the Aphogee shampoo and follow up with this reconstructor there is NO BREAKAGE.</li>
    <li> i use this keratin conditioner weekly mixed with macadamia conditioning mask. my hair is shiny and smooth and doesn&#x27;t break off as much anymore</li>
    <li> Keratin has been the only way for me to get my hair to grow long and stay less frizzy.  I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of years and it&#x27;s the best and least expensive way to get keratin into your hair.  I used to get very pricy keratin treatments but I have replaced them with this. I use it every-other day.  I can do a keratin hair strand test (google it if you don&#x27;t know how) to ensure that I&#x27;m putting it on the places that still need keratin.  Some people can&#x27;t use it as often because their hair doesn&#x27;t need as much keratin.  Again: do the keratin strand test to make sure you are not over or under using it.  I find that my ends always need it but that my roots don&#x27;t (as long as I&#x27;m getting regular hair cuts).  I have long, curly, fine, thin, dry hair.</li>
    <li> I wanted to use this twice before reviewing so here it is....this stuff works. My hair (long straight and fine) has been bleached and dyed and has been recovering for several months add on dry broken hair from damage and medication &#x3D; complete mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impression was in the shower when I went to rise the product out and my knots fell out of my hair! Literally May hair fell down on my back, usually it just knots up. I blow dried my hair afterwards and it was really shiny but seemed a little dry. After shampooing the next day for a week after my initial use, my hair has been shiny and silky. It&#x27;s so beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this again today, a week later, hoping I wasn&#x27;t overdoing it. Same results as last time but this time my hair didn&#x27;t feel as dry afterwards. I&#x27;m going to shelf it and use it once twice a month. This stuff works magic! And the results last. I love it! For the price it&#x27;s worth a try its a huge huge win! IMO</li>
    <li> I am AA with curly/kinky natural hair.  This product provides me with a nice hit of protein without going overboard.  My hair feel soft yet strong - not at all dry.  This is on my holy grail list!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about 3 weeks now. I feel no positive difference in my hair, and if anything, my hair feels a bit dryer than before even. I&#x27;m discontinuing the use of this stuff and moving on to a (hopefully) better reconstructing conditioner that will actually help. This stuff really wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> I have healthy hair but this is a really bad hair product, dont waste your money on this product. Morrocanoil does a much better work, even any cheaper conditioner form CVS is better</li>
    <li> Im mixed and I treat my hair with chemicals, and since I found this product my hair has stopped breakage for good.  It is thick and strong even with all the heat that ai put into it.I use it weekly after shampooing I only leave it for 5 minutes then I use a moisturizer for dry hair, my hair has never been so healthy :)  It worth to try!!</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT, GOOD CARE OF SELLER. I RECOMMEND 100%</li>
    <li> I really love using this conditioner and like the way my hair agrees to it after it is dry.  I also use the leave-in conditioner too.</li>
    <li> Great seller and product! Makes my hair feel like silk.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I decided to use this product. The first time I used all the products of the aphogee line and had keratin overload.  Instead of my hair being soft  and silky, it was hard brittle and breaking horribly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stopped all aphogee treatments but kept using the moisturizing shampoo and conditioner and added coconut oil for deep conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;Once my hair was somewhat under control I decided to use the reconstructurizer again. For the first time my relaxed hair looks like I did it in the salon and reduced my shedding drastically. This will definitely be part of my routine but I am going to use it once a month for fear of keratin overload again!</li>
    <li> I ordered this on a Sunday morning and got it Monday afternoon. That is some amazingly fast shipping! I am caucasian and have 3A curls with some color damage, and I&#x27;m convinced this is repairing the frizz. I have used it 3 or 4 times in a couple weeks and it looks great every time. It&#x27;s worth the buy!</li>
    <li> Best conditioner for strengthening and growing hair!! Works!!</li>
    <li> I used this product just once and I automatically noticed the difference. I have very curly, long, thick hair and I use the flat iron a lot whenever I want to wear my hair straight so I have some heat damage. This product left my curls feeling very silky after I rinsed it out and the curls look much nicer as well. I will definitely use this product once a week.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve researched many different products prior to my purchase of Aphogee Keratin 2 Minute Reconstructor. I decided to try this product based on the great product reviews. So far I&#x27;ve used this product 4 times, and my hair doesn&#x27;t look healthy or shiny. I had dry brittle hair before, and now my hair is not so dry, but I&#x27;ve got lots of split-ends!!!</li>
    <li> Highly recommended as this adds a great amount of strength to your hair.  I have coarse, color treated hair that I straighten regulairly; I love applying this product as directed, including wrapping a warm towel around my head, and letting it sit for 5-10 minutes.  I&#x27;ve noticed my split ends are gradually getting better - I&#x27;m on a mission to have healthy hair by the end of the summer!  (only giving this 4 stars due to scent - not a huge fan!)</li>
    <li> Great to relaxed ladies (keratin) or swimmers (removes minerla deposits). This conditioner adds alot of slip and prevents breakage. Smells nice too.</li>
    <li> Liquid gold. Best stuff</li>
    <li> Bought the whole brand. I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> Aphogee has always been the bomb for me. Been using it for a 4 years now. I can definitely tell when I&#x27;ve skipped it. My hair breaks off and sheds much easier than when I use it. the difference is immediate. I use it before my moisturizing conditioner and it&#x27;s great. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an African male who is tryig to grow his hair out for locs but has high porosity hair. Found out after doing some research. Looked all over the web for a solution and this is the product that everyone says works for a person with my situation. My little even told me about this because she&#x27;s all into hair care. You know what, this stuff seems to be working. I&#x27;ve used it twice a week for two weeks and my hair seems to be getting better stronger. It does make my hair drier after I use it but it&#x27;s purpose of strengthening my hair seems to be working.</li>
    <li> I have to say my hair has not felt so good as after I use the reconstructor.  After a year of trying the whole natural thing, I went to the &amp;#34;creamy crack&amp;#34; relaxer and I was so worried that my hair would never bounce back.  After I wash my hair and condition it with a combo of good sulfate only products ( i love Suave Salon Naturals-Rosemary &amp; Mint Products) I use the reconstructor.  I also put my hair underneath a cholesterol cap (found at your local beauty supply) and let it deep condition for about 30 minutes if I have the time.  If not, I don&#x27;t do any shorter than 10 minutes.  It works so beautifully on my hair I just love it!!</li>
    <li> Love it. Works excellent. Glad to add it to my regimen. Relaxed healthy hair blog brought me here and the reviews on Amazon made me buy a bottle at my bwauty supply store in nj.</li>
    <li> I live in the desert and between the hard water and the harsh weather, my hair is trashed.  I&#x27;ve been looking for a good hair mask (tried a bunch) and came across this on Beauty Insider.  This product is amazing - my hair hasn&#x27;t looked this good in ages.  Love it.</li>
    <li> First use, didn&#x27;t make my hair feel any differently. I have 3-4 different textures of natural hair on my head, and the treatment left my hair the same.</li>
    <li> Boy does this leave my hair feeling dry and brittle. If you are going to use it, follow it up with a GOOD GOOD moisturizing conditioner. The product is good to add some protein to the hair though.</li>
    <li> My favorite conditioner yet!  Makes fine frizzy hair soft, manageable and healthy feeling!</li>
    <li> This conditioner is wonderful!  It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, yet my hair feels repaired and replenished after I use it!</li>
    <li> I have very dry and brittle hair. But this stuff has really changed the texture of my hair. Its not near as frizzy and so much softer!!</li>
    <li> With most conditioners that I&#x27;ve used, my hair is breakage-free for the first 2 days. After that, breakage starts once again. Every time I use this, I can go for an entire week without strands coming of. This is a big deal for me. Definitely worth the extra bucks.</li>
    <li> I recently bleached my hair white. Now, I usually have naturally very curly hair. Needless to say, the bleaching totally killed my hair. It became dry, brittle, frizzy, and straight. I went to get a few inches cut off of my hair and the hairdresser said my hair needed protein badly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try this product after reading the reviews and I must say, I am pretty happy with it. Mind you, it didn&#x27;t totally fix my hair, but I have since gained half of my curl back and my hair no longer &amp;#34;stretches&amp;#34; when I comb my leave in conditioned in it. I will continue to use this once a week as the product reccommends and hope it continues to fix my hair!</li>
    <li> My wife researched and found this product got great reviews. So I bought it for her and it left her hair shiny and soft...which is why she gave it a two instead of a one. Split ends are still there!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Aphogee products in the past so I know the wonders, but after having severe breakage/shedding and contemplating a serious haircut I remembered this line in the past.  Not sure why I waited this long......I used to have hair in the sink, over my shoulders, and on the floor after styling in the mornings.  After just 1 use, I have almost no shedding, and minimal hair in the comb after combing.  What was I thinking???  Aphogee is the real deal, it is \\&quot;serious\\&quot; for \\&quot;seriously damaged\\&quot; hair.  So just buy it!!  Can&#x27;t wait for the condition of my hair to improve even more with each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Aphogee!!!!</li>
    <li> I use this in addition to my regular conditioner and it leaves my hair feeling smooth and healthy. The product smells really good too.</li>
    <li> I have actually used this as a cleansing conditioner and it works great! I love this brand!!!</li>
    <li> This is my first Amazon review! I found this product on YouTube being used by a lot of girls who also have natural hair. My hair is very thick and an inch past shoulder length. I usually wear my hair blow dried and flat ironed straight. Therefore I felt my hair losing its natural curl on the ends after washing, possibly being heat damaged. Also since the winter months it has been shedding and splitting really bad. So i decided to try my first protein treatment and wanted to start off slow. I was really nervous!   I read reviews that I should wash and condition as normal and then place this 2 minute re constructor in. So I followed this routine:  1.Biosilk Silk Therapy Shampooed   2.Detangled with Biosilk Silk Therapy Conditioner added with Mane and Tail Conditioner  3.Washed out   4.Sections hair in 4 sections and Used Aphrogee 2 minute Keratin Treatment Packets (i used both as i have a lot of hair)  5.Put shower cap on and sat for 5-7 minutes. (it took like 10 minutes to put in my hair)  6.Washed out  7. Then used Olive Oil deep Conditioning Packet (30 minutes with shower cap)*this is a first time product I used....  8. Washed out, blow dried and straightened as usual using my EVO and Coconut oil. Then flat ironed  I seen too many reviews that this would leave your hair feeling dry and stiff. Being as though my hair is natural, it would be impossible for me to detangle after that treatment without breaking off my hair. So i decided to deep condition after. Which is the best idea i think!!  Results: I&#x27;m NOT super ecstatic about it?! My hair visibly looked shiny and strong after straighten. I DID see an immediate difference in my curl pattern after washing it (before blow drying). My ends had more curl definition. So this will be great in the summer when I want to wear my natural texture. Im guessing this brings back the protein and your redefines your natural texture. I didnt see anymore or less hair shedding from blow drying. Hopefully I will see less split ends and less shedding since using it. Not sure how often I will try this maybe once a month or every 2 weeks. My normal routine takes forever so this already adds an extra 20 minutes&gt; making this at least 3 hours of hair time UGH LOL...keep you posted!</li>
    <li> Very sad that i didnt get amazing results. I would actually leave this in my hair for longer than two minutes and it still did not help any. My hair is so rough and horrible split ends i dont know what to do. I will def not repurchase this!</li>
    <li> Great product. This saved my hair when it was over processed by dye.</li>
    <li> got this for a good price. I wanted to try this product because i was having breakage and shedding of my hair and this has helped to much. My hair is shedding less and less</li>
    <li> A few months ago I extremely bleached my hair. I&#x27;m talking about bleach blonde. I have natural curly hair and when I bleached it my curls kind of went away. I receantly dyed my hair a dark brown hair color ( bleaching is just too high maintenance ) and my curls weren&#x27;t still the same. I read up on how to get my texture back and keratin 2 was one of the products that kept coming into my research.  I barely got it today I left it in for 5 minutes due to how damaged my hair is, and I&#x27;m not lying but my curls are coming back. It&#x27;s going to take a few months for my hair to heal but I&#x27;m definitely buying this product again. I recommend this product to anyone with extremely damaged hair.</li>
    <li> Great product to have on hand. I do a treatment 3-4 times a month and I see a difference.</li>
    <li> Hair was noticeable softer  after I used it</li>
    <li> My hair has been in very bad condition for long time as a result of once a month dying process (only to my roots every time).&lt;br /&gt;I used Emergency treatment by Nexus 2 times and I lost half of all my hair. This was about a year ago. It was a disaster. Then, I started using this product (Keratin 2 minutes re constructor also by nexus). The first time; I used it for 2 minutes and I did not feel improvement at all, only some softness but I kept loosing hair.  Same thing happened for a couple of more times. I stopped the product. Then, weeks later I used it again for longer time and the result was the same. I stopped it again for months. But I have been reading this reviews about how good is the product and yesterday I gave it another chance. But this time I had it on my head 1 hour, no heat, no towel, just the product. The result was so scary that today I feel like I don&#x27;t want to stand up from my bed. I lost hair like you don&#x27;t believed it. Hair is also absolutely dry and brittle. Please help me. Definitely this product is not for me or I should say Nexus at all is not me, and I think that if whatever happened to me yesterday is the result of longer time exposure; precautions should be addressed in the bottle. I know that it says 2 minutes, but it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to let people know the consequences of using it for longer time. Any advice would be really appreciated.</li>
    <li> Just to be clear...I&#x27;ve only used this 1 time. But it made my hair feel sooooo good. It&#x27;s nice and creamy and it smells wonderful. Usually when I use a protein based conditioner, I immediately follow up with a moisturizing conditioner, as the protein makes my hair kind of hard and straw like. Not with this though. This felt like a moisture conditioner from the time I applied it till I rinsed it out. It made my hair so soft and manageable. It will be hard to keep from using more than once a week, but I don&#x27;t want to end up with protein overload.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely keep using and am considering getting a couple more bottles so I won&#x27;t run out!</li>
    <li> I wash my hair once a week and this product has really cut down on how much time I have to spend on conditioning my hair, after leaving Aphogee on for the 2 minutes my hair feels so much stronger. If you have hair that needs more protein this is the product for you.</li>
    <li> I love it! I have transitioning hair, known for its breakage but this helps so much. It literally works in 2 minutes and your hair will feel softer as you&#x27;re applying it. I see less breakage already and I&#x27;ve only been using it for 2 weeks. Protein treatments normally make hair dry and tangled but this one just feels like a deep conditioner with a lot of slip. Great product!</li>
    <li> Started doing my hair at home about 9 months ago and use this sporadically - My hair loves this!</li>
    <li> Hi! I am AA. And my hair is a short blonde TWA ( teeny weeny Afro!) I have always had dry hair, and the dye was damaging it badly. But I really loved it.....so I have been trying everything! But this works !!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have a very simple hair care regime, now and my hair is growing and still that fierce blonde!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I co wash my hair with tressemme&#x27; moisture rich conditioner. I only &#x27;really&#x27; wash it after dying and if I go swimming and any pool water gets under the cap... Then I use Apogee&#x27; shampoo for damaged hair) towel dry. Then apply this product and allow this product to stay in my hair for 15 mins. Rinse and style as usual..&lt;br /&gt;( for natural hair care, I use Long Aid Curl Activator, I posted a review and my hair care regime on here... )&lt;br /&gt;This stuff really works! My hair is much more manageable! Soft And if I allow my hair to completely dry, it curls up and when u pull it out it springs back in place! I love it! I have had virturally no shredding and my hair is growing! (shooting for an Angela Davis Afro!)&lt;br /&gt;But u do have to be honest with yourself... If ur hair is shredding or if you have split ends, you do need to get rid of the damaged hair first! It will continue to break!</li>
    <li> This was even more than I could have hoped for. I ruined my hair with dye and stripper, MULTIPLE times, to the point where some of it literally just....it broke.  My hair broke because it was so brittle.  Just a patch, but it jolted me to reality and I tried to find something to help with how much damage I had caused, and I found this.  I use it every other conditioning or so, and sometimes just mix it with my regular conditioner, and now my hair is soft and smooth again. It&#x27;s still a little fragile, but this stuff has just worked freaking wonders.  I don&#x27;t know how, but I can always tell the difference when I use it and when I don&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s totally worth trying, especially if you&#x27;ve made some major hair mistakes like I have.</li>
    <li> The seller is awsome i got my package super fast and as for the product i LOVE it. As soon as i opened the package i used it and my hair is sooo soft. I diffused my hair with nothing but some frizz be gone stuff and my hair is big and beautiful! LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff.</li>
    <li> There is definitely a noticeable difference as hair feels like silk from this in 2 minutes. It&#x27;s pleasant smelling, and my hair has gotten a lot stronger since I first used it. There are not any sulfates in this line. I recommend this and the shampoo, as well as the leave in conditioner. I&#x27;ve been using all 3 and am here re-ordering. Excellent product line at excellent price - well worth it!</li>
    <li> I have been a big fan of Aphogee conditioning products for some time, and although I have always preferred the 2 Step Protein Treatment (that hardens on the hair when you sit under the dryer), I was pleasantly surprised at the idea of deep conditioning in under 5 minutes, so I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And honestly, it is a little hard to get used to the idea of any real conditioning being done in under 20-30 minutes…So, I still prefer the (egg-like) Reconstructor for treating damaged hair, shedding, or bleached or chemically styled hair issues- - as a fave in general, but I think the Aphogee 2 Min Reconstructor is a nice product and great for general deep conditioning needs (especially if you are in a hurry or have time constraints, or are looking for a shorter summer regimen).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, overall a solid conditioning product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grade: B- or Four Stars</li>
    <li> Good quality, my hair before I use this product, has damage because salt water, hair dryer, etc, but now since I use Aphogee my hair is totally different, it fells silky, shiny and look awesome. Good Product!</li>
    <li> Not all that. Just like any other conditioner. Must not be very much protein in it because I&#x27;ve gone through a whole bottle and see no results.</li>
    <li> I have been using Aphogee for 6 months on my hair once a week. It not only has made my hair fuller but has grown faster as well as soft. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Im African American NL hair! I had so much breakage in the back of my hair. Soon as i put this in i left it on for 5 minutes and did a deep condition afterwards! I noticed my hair felt so much stronger as i was washing the deep conditioner out. No more mushy limp hair with breakage!!</li>
    <li> I use Aphogee Keratin 2 Minute Reconstructor once or twice a month and it leaves my hair smooth and strong! It protects against heat damage and I get a lot less breakage. It&#x27;s a bit pricey but worth it!</li>
    <li> Works well and smells great, like coconut and tropical islands!  Used it on bleached hair and it restored softness.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It softens and makes my permed hair manageable.&lt;br /&gt;It smell really good... My hubby complimented me on smell of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;and i just love it....!!!</li>
    <li> Like crack for hair. Totally transformed my hair from dry and breaking to stronger and surprisingly softer! Decent scent not strong or overbearing . And works wonders and is quick and easy for someone who doesn&#x27;t get to spend all day on there hair like me!</li>
    <li> Prior to becoming a mom 3 yrs ago, I took excellent care of my relaxed hair.  Once I had my child, personal time and supplemental cash were practically nonexistent so going to the salon often or taking the extra time to deep condition, sit under a personal home dryer and/or roller set my hair wasn&#x27;t doable or financially feasible.  The [[ASIN:B000BU7G1A Aphogee Keratin 2 Minute Reconstructor 16oz]] has made the difference between having no hair (lol) to at least having reasonably healthy looking hair and less breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have a lot of time, use time saving tools (flat irons, curling irons, blow dryers, etc.) and have a lot of breakage as a result, this reconstructor will help in halting *some* of that breakage (though you will definitely have to supplement it with other hair care products like serums and other heat styling protectants).  It doesn&#x27;t work miracles, but it does pretty darn close when you need it to.</li>
    <li> I use this protein treatment once a week or every time I wash my hair. I love the way it smells and I like using it. I bought it almost a year ago OR sometime in the summer and I still own it, which is great because I am heavy handed. I will def buy it again.</li>
    <li> Saw this being used on a YouTube Video and tried it for my damaged hair. It really does work along with the other Aphogee products.</li>
    <li> The reconstructor definitely does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. It strengthened my hair which caused less breakage. HOWEVER, it made my hair hard; so what I did to combat this was after I rinsed out the reconstructor, I put a deep conditioner on my hair, a warm towel, and a shower cap. I left the conditioner on for about 30 minutes, rinsed it out, and proceeded to style as usual. My hair was stronger, conditioned, and had a nice shine to it.</li>
    <li> This conditioner smells great and left my damaged hair looking and feeling great. I have 3b curls and they were damaged by too much heat and not enough protection. I saw results immediately. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this daily, it will make your hair dry and brittle. Use it until it works. For me, it worked immediately. I&#x27;ve purchased this again to bring my curls back to life after straightening. I would use it once OE twice a month with a deep conditioner to maintain the health of my hair. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> Definitely buying again. Transformed my hair. So soft. I leave it in like a mask. Great price too! I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
    <li> Brings strength back to my hair after just a few minutes!</li>
    <li> it made my hair strong enough to get a perm as I had had highlights and was too fragile for a perm before using this for a week</li>
    <li> Great conditioner!! Will diffenantly buy again.</li>
    <li> Two Words &amp;#34;Love it&amp;#34;..</li>
    <li> Worked wonderfully for repairing my over moisturized hair.</li>
    <li> I left the product in my hair for about 5 minutes and I could feel the difference in texture As I washed it out. When it dried it was still very soft and helped with my split ends. This product is great and the price makes it even better.</li>
    <li> My hair is kind of fluffy and this keeps it smooth, I use a lot of it when I apply it and leave on for a few minutes. I was happy to see it an Amazon because it is kind of hard to find.</li>
    <li> This contains mineral oil, petrolatum, and silicones. Not the ingredients listed!</li>
    <li> This is a must have in my haircare collection and regimen. It soothes my hair as well as strengthens it. I have very tight medium textured curls. Must have for structure.</li>
    <li> This is a great quick protein treatment. I use this when I notice my hair shedding excessively, and it SEEMS to help in my retention. It&#x27;s a plus that it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair super dry.</li>
    <li> I recently started swimming 3x a week without a swimming cap (because I haven&#x27;t found the right one that&#x27;s comfortable and will stay on) and my hair was really suffering from it -- becoming more and more straw-like. But after just one use of this stuff (left it on for 2 mins), it made my hair soft and manageable again. I don&#x27;t usually leave reviews on products that I purchase on Amazon, but I felt like I had to this time because this stuff really does work!</li>
    <li> Great for strengthening hair but I would caution against using it for too long. After a yr or so of use (once a week), it really took a toll on my hair and dried it out.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love love love this product! I have relaxed colored hair that tends to become dry and prone to breakage if not managed correctly, this product gives it some much needed protein and instantly stops breakage. This has become a super staple in my regimen (once every other week. alternate with moisture)</li>
    <li> it did make my hair soft like it said it would but it didn&#x27;t really tone down my breakage but then again I only I used once which was yesterday . i&#x27;ll to use it some more to see If it will  actually work but for now its okay</li>
    <li> Love this reconstructor! I use it once a week to prevent breaking. The instructions say leave on for 2 mins for lightly damaged hair, and 5 mins for badly damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have light breaking i leave it on for 5 mins with a cap. After washing out there is little to no hair in the the drain mesh. This smells great as well. With consistent use my hair doesn&#x27;t break except for normal sheading during a regular wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use a very good humecto conditioner after with a cap, to top things off. My hair feels and smells wonderful after.</li>
    <li> Such a great product I will always keep in my hair product list. I love this.</li>
    <li> First of all, I have very fine, naturally wavy/curly caucasian hair that I&#x27;ve dyed &amp; tortured with heat for years. I recently had about 7-8 inches to cut off most of the damaged hair. My worst mistake was going over two years without having it cut, just trying to trim the ends myself at home on my front porch. All in all, it looked like crap. Since I&#x27;ve cutting it short, I&#x27;ve been using a lot of heat via flat iron and/or blow dryer so I worried about the damage I&#x27;ve been creating on it already. After my cut, I went next door to Sally&#x27;s &amp; purchased Aphogee Balancing Moisturizer as well as a packet of the 2 minute Keratin Reconstructor. I&#x27;ve been using the moisturizer for the past week every few days &amp; I&#x27;ve been pleased so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I didn&#x27;t have to work today (and not knowing what to expect), I shampooed my hair using one of my normal shampoos &amp; wrung out a good bit of the excess water out after rinsing. I then applied 1/4 of the packet to my hair &amp; covered with a shower cap, and then covered that with a hot wash cloth to provide a bit more heat while I finished my shower. Following the directions mostly, after the rest of my shower (maybe 10 minutes?), I rinsed this product out using cool/lukewarm water. It felt a little weird but I continued to work excess water out with a towel, then sat outside to let it air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results? OMG, I never combed/brushed it after towel drying it but my hair feels so incredibly soft &amp; it&#x27;s not tangled in the slightest! My hair normally is a trainwreck if I don&#x27;t at least comb through it after drying so I&#x27;m shocked at how wonderful it feels now! It almost makes me sad to have cut off my length before trying this first, just to see how it would have done, but I know I&#x27;ll use this every few weeks when I sense I need a keratin treatment! It doesn&#x27;t hurt that it smells REALLY good as well.</li>
    <li> This is my no. 1 hair product. Before discovering this, my hair was so porous, meaning it&#x27;s loses moisture at a fast rate resulting in really dry hair. This correct my porosity very good. It also adds softness and strength at the same time. I&#x27;m relaxed btw. I use it weekly before I deep condition or I add some to my conditioner.</li>
    <li> My hair loves protein and it loves this soft protein I use it at least one per month, sometimes every 2 weeks. It works well with the 2 step protein treatment which is a hard protein that I use every 6 weeks.</li>
    <li> I have used the 2 minute reconstructor for almost a year now.  I first started using it after I bleached my baby-fine dark brown hair platinum--my hair was so brittle and damaged it was ready to just fall off. This stuff completely saved me from needing a pixie cut--my hair was breaking off 2 inches from the root, but the Aphogee reconstructor helped strengthen it and prevent further breakage.  I have used it since, every week or so, to keep the brittleness and breakage at bay. It has helped restore shine and strength to my hair after each chemical process, and made my hair feel amazing after henna.  I would recommend this for anyone with damaged hair, it&#x27;s affordable, easy to use, and REALLY helps!</li>
    <li> This smells really nice, but I&#x27;m not crazy about how it feels on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t make it softer or make my hair feel any better than usual.&lt;br /&gt;I will use it once every two weeks until the bottle is empty.</li>
