      <li>great!</li>
      <li>They are great</li>
      <li>Great alternative</li>
      <li>It works great.</li>
      <li>Comfy to sleep in and the curls come out great</li>
      <li>I will update when I get around to doing this :p</li>
      <li>perfect for fine medium length hair</li>
      <li>Works just as good as I thought did, definately recommend them.</li>
      <li>They have the shape of a really good curling iron type curl, but without the heat damage crunchiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>On the plus side they are well made and are just as good as the conair ones.</li>
      <li>I love these!</li>
      <li>So many and nicely packaged!</li>
      <li>Please buy and try I love flexi rods.no more heat  to achieve  beautiful curls.</li>
      <li>They do give by FAR the best curl I have ever had.</li>
      <li>My twins love the rollers because they are very easy to use and bring about the needed results that they want.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re easy to use and I love them!</li>
      <li>love the look</li>
      <li>They are ok.</li>
      <li>, I roll them a bit tighter, and the top hair that tends to come undone</li>
      <li>, I wish I had more long pieces, but the product was excellent.</li>
      <li>They are a bit long for my length hair, but perfect width!</li>
      <li>Time took shorter than expected which was wonderful.</li>
      <li>Or even those cheap foam rollers from drugstores work better if you&#x27;re looking for something to transform your look over night.</li>
      <li>There is not a curling method that is going to be as comfortable as sleeping with no curlers in.</li>
      <li>Really!!!</li>
      <li>I have them in right now!</li>
      <li>But this is honestly true for all night leave in curlers.</li>
      <li>Worth the price.</li>
      <li>fix the problem of layers and the hair not staying tucked in at the bottom, I make sure the hair is more damp first of all, and then I use small rubber hairties to securely fasten them to the roller before pinching the foam in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>sure people with straight hair will wake up with my expectation of beachy waves, but sadly no curly haired people will have the same result.</li>
      <li>and I was so excited to receive them early.  </li>
      <li>fix the problem of too much hair and not enough roller (at the top the hair comes unrolled)</li>
      <li>and then you&#x27;ll have some nice curls, and then some odd shaped pieces of hair.</li>
      <li>I was really expecting to wake up with beautiful beach waves when instead I woke up looking like a women from the 40&#x27;s with absoulutly extreme curls that were not very pretty.</li>
      <li>It works as well as the real curl formers .</li>
      <li>do not buy this if you hhave a sensitive nose!</li>
      <li>fix the hair getting caught around the white cap issue AND hopefully the smell issue, I plan to take some old clean socks and sew tubes out of them that are slightly smaller than the foam.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried pin curls, sock curls, curling iron curls, hot rollers, twisty bun curls, rope braid curls, flat iron curls.</li>
      <li>For layered hair they don&#x27;t work quite as well, if you take a chunk of hair that is from more than one layer, the ends aren&#x27;t even, and it is hard to squeeze the roller in place to make them all stay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I sleep with this soft rollers at night .perfect</li>
      <li>Works well on my natural hair</li>
      <li>I need to buy more cause my hair is really thick</li>
      <li>However, this means that hairs can EASILY get trapped in between the white plastic cap and the foam.</li>
      <li>They are not comfortable to sleep in, and barely comfortable enough to just walk around in.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to find curlers soft enough to allow her to sleep on them.</li>
      <li>I folded the rollers over tightly after finally sort of getting the hair rolled and it pops right open again and everything falls apart.  </li>

<li> I folded the rollers over tightly after finally sort of getting the hair rolled and it pops right open again and everything falls apart.  </li>
<li> My experience was not enjoyable but yours very well could be.</li>
<li> They last quite long.</li>
<li> I find they aren&#x27;t really long enough for my hair.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had some other no heat methods last longer, but they do still give my type 1 hair that is prone to greasiness some wave on the 2nd or sometimes 3rd day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I have hair that just covers my breasts, so a decent size past my shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> They were too long and did not have the desired effect.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t take long to apply them and they leave you looking like you just stepped out of the salon.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had more uncomfortable curlers, and less.</li>
<li> They are the fastest drying no heat curl method I&#x27;ve ever tried, probably due to the larger surface area of the hair that is exposed to the air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
<li> Arrived through USPS early.works excellent.love my curls.i want to buy other diameters to try different curls.my hair is layered but falls at  16 inch length.</li>
<li> Leaves your hair smelling very strange.</li>
<li> If its even the slightest bit damp it won&#x27;t dry</li>
<li> They work if you put them in while awake, and if your hair is basically dry.</li>
<li> These are a total waste of time and money.</li>
<li> i don&#x27;t think it worked that well on my hair as i expected</li>
<li> this product is not really for you.</li>
<li> Shipped faster than expected (received within 2 weeks of order)</li>
<li> I would just say save a few bucks and use a curling iron.</li>
<li> but it does create a few waves.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if the smell will ever go away.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t have to recurl my hair for at least 2-3 days after using them.</li>
<li> Maybe with time they at least won&#x27;t impart it onto my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> They are definitely a must have for the ladies who hate spending a lot of time on their hair.</li>
<li> another issue is that they are so uncomfortable to sleep with and the pulling on my hair gave me a headache..</li>
<li> They are uncomfortable.</li>
<li> This is painful and probably damaging to the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Hopefully this will take away the smell and the painful caught hair.</li>

    <li> They are ok. Don&#x27;t stick to hair as they should.</li>
    <li> My twins love the rollers because they are very easy to use and bring about the needed results that they want.</li>
    <li> great! works like flexi-rods. I don&#x27;t have to use heat now when I straighten my hair for a wavy/ curling wand look. Great alternative</li>
    <li> They work if you put them in while awake, and if your hair is basically dry. If its even the slightest bit damp it won&#x27;t dry and then you&#x27;ll have some nice curls, and then some odd shaped pieces of hair. They are not comfortable to sleep in, and barely comfortable enough to just walk around in. I would just say save a few bucks and use a curling iron. Or even those cheap foam rollers from drugstores work better if you&#x27;re looking for something to transform your look over night.</li>
    <li> It works as well as the real curl formers . I sleep with this soft rollers at night .perfect ringlets in the morning .</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife&#x27;s waist-length hair. I&#x27;ve been trying to find curlers soft enough to allow her to sleep on them. It works great.</li>
    <li> Works well on my natural hair</li>
    <li> If you have naturaly curly hair this product is not really for you. I was really expecting to wake up with beautiful beach waves when instead I woke up looking like a women from the 40&#x27;s with absoulutly extreme curls that were not very pretty. Im sure people with straight hair will wake up with my expectation of beachy waves, but sadly no curly haired people will have the same result. another issue is that they are so uncomfortable to sleep with and the pulling on my hair gave me a headache.. On the plus side they are well made and are just as good as the conair ones. My experience was not enjoyable but yours very well could be. So thank u for reading hope I helped!</li>
    <li> What a great buy! So many and nicely packaged!</li>
    <li> This product works well, I wish I had more long pieces, but the product was excellent. Time took shorter than expected which was wonderful.</li>
    <li> These curlers saved me from getting a damaging permanent. I wanted curly hair but didn&#x27;t want to go through putting on the chemicals on my hair. They&#x27;re easy to use and I love them!</li>
    <li> Never have used them before so had to use online tutorials but still came out great! love the look it gives my hair. Shipped faster than expected (received within 2 weeks of order)</li>
    <li> Arrived through USPS early.works excellent.love my curls.i want to buy other diameters to try different curls.my hair is layered but falls at  16 inch length. Please buy and try I love flexi rods.no more heat  to achieve  beautiful curls. I&#x27;ve get complements regularly.</li>
    <li> I love these! If I could get another chance to order them again, I&#x27;d probably get shorter ones. They are a bit long for my length hair, but perfect width! And theyve lasted for almost a year now and no damage to my hair!</li>
    <li> Works just as good as I thought did, definately recommend them. Comfy to sleep in and the curls come out great</li>
    <li> Material is cheap, poorly made,  flexible enough but doesn&#x27;t do its job.  Worth the price.</li>
    <li> These things suck and totally do not work. Save your self time and money and just don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t think it worked that well on my hair as i expected but it does create a few waves.</li>
    <li> These do work well. I will post a photo of my curls using these later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;1. They smell. Like foam and plastic, and the smell is imparted onto your hair. I tried soaking them in conditioner and a mint essential oil, but they still smelled. I&#x27;m not sure if the smell will ever go away. Maybe with time they at least won&#x27;t impart it onto my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The white caps on the end are not attached to the orange foam. They are held on by tension from the flexible metal rod in the middle; the rod is a bit shorter than the foam, so the caps at the end are held in place with tension. However, this means that hairs can EASILY get trapped in between the white plastic cap and the foam. This is painful and probably damaging to the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. I find they aren&#x27;t really long enough for my hair. I have hair that just covers my breasts, so a decent size past my shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. For layered hair they don&#x27;t work quite as well, if you take a chunk of hair that is from more than one layer, the ends aren&#x27;t even, and it is hard to squeeze the roller in place to make them all stay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. They are uncomfortable. But this is honestly true for all night leave in curlers. There is not a curling method that is going to be as comfortable as sleeping with no curlers in. I&#x27;ve had more uncomfortable curlers, and less. So these are mid range in comfort I&#x27;d say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. They do give by FAR the best curl I have ever had. I&#x27;ve tried pin curls, sock curls, curling iron curls, hot rollers, twisty bun curls, rope braid curls, flat iron curls. They have the shape of a really good curling iron type curl, but without the heat damage crunchiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. They are the fastest drying no heat curl method I&#x27;ve ever tried, probably due to the larger surface area of the hair that is exposed to the air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. They last quite long. I&#x27;ve had some other no heat methods last longer, but they do still give my type 1 hair that is prone to greasiness some wave on the 2nd or sometimes 3rd day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I have altered them to suit my needs:&lt;br /&gt;To fix the problem of too much hair and not enough roller (at the top the hair comes unrolled), I roll them a bit tighter, and the top hair that tends to come undone I use a bobby pin to affix it to the hair already on the roller. This tends to make it not fall out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To fix the problem of layers and the hair not staying tucked in at the bottom, I make sure the hair is more damp first of all, and then I use small rubber hairties to securely fasten them to the roller before pinching the foam in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To fix the hair getting caught around the white cap issue AND hopefully the smell issue, I plan to take some old clean socks and sew tubes out of them that are slightly smaller than the foam. Roll the sock tubes over the foam ones, sew the bottoms up, and voila! Hopefully this will take away the smell and the painful caught hair. I will update when I get around to doing this :p</li>
    <li> The curlers don&#x27;t grip the hair so it won&#x27;t stay on the roller.  I folded the rollers over tightly after finally sort of getting the hair rolled and it pops right open again and everything falls apart.  These are a total waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> Leaves your hair smelling very strange. It ended up giving me a headache. do not buy this if you hhave a sensitive nose!</li>
    <li> I have them in right now! They are great I don&#x27;t have to recurl my hair for at least 2-3 days after using them. They are definitely a must have for the ladies who hate spending a lot of time on their hair. It doesn&#x27;t take long to apply them and they leave you looking like you just stepped out of the salon. Really!!!</li>
    <li> I loveeee them! I need to buy more cause my hair is really thick so the amount of them wasnt enough so ill def be ordering more soon</li>
    <li> This product was just a described and I was so excited to receive them early.  I cant wait to use them.</li>
    <li> Made my hair curly and bouncy - lasted all day!!</li>
    <li> These did not work with my hair at all.  They were too long and did not have the desired effect.</li>
    <li> works great! perfect for fine medium length hair</li>
