      <li>This looks natural and AMAZING!</li>

      <li>I use this with regular mascara and it works amazingly!</li>
      <li>I love this way of making your lashes look longer and it really works!</li>
      <li>I am going to try another brand for comparison purposes but for two sets it was definitely worth the price!</li>
      <li>Want a full eyelash look?</li>
      <li>What good is a product if you must use your current product to receive the effect you want?</li>
      <li>Not as easy to use as others at a higher price.</li>
      <li>For the cost and how quickly it was delivered...</li>
      <li>Sooo worth the money.</li>
      <li>So much more than regular mascara.</li>
      <li>do not work nearly like the original leopard onea.</li>
      <li>but if u really want it to pop I suggest to use ur favorite regular mascara first, then keep repeating with the  transplanting gel, fiber to get the look</li>
      <li>I guess I was expecting too much.</li>
      <li>and it doesnt bother too much.</li>
      <li>You have to apply very well the gel</li>
      <li>It really makes my lashes LONGER.  </li>
      <li>After applying it, my eyelashes looked false and that made me happy.</li>
      <li>which is WAY more trouble than it&#x27;s worth).</li>
      <li>But I would def if u have the extra money to spend go with the original</li>
      <li>Not quite sure what the difference is but will go back to the 4 pack of the same style.</li>
      <li>Also they try to con you into spending more money so be careful!!!</li>
      <li>I got the product pretty fast and did get four mascara in total (2 gel and 2 fiber).</li>
      <li>right what I had mention above</li>
      <li>the 2 new oneas</li>
      <li>I must admit I am surprised at the high ratings having read through the reviews.</li>
      <li>After seeing so many fiber lash products being advertised lately I went to my go to place (Amazon) to try it.</li>
      <li>I guess the old :you get what you pay for&amp;#34; applies here.  </li>
      <li>When I recieved it I was surprised to see that there was 2 sets</li>
      <li>No need for false eyelashes when you have your own that look that way.</li>
      <li>First it arrived with no pretty case.</li>
      <li>It does take a few tries to get it applied properly but after that it was easy!</li>
      <li>u really want other then</li>

<li> These are messy if your eyes are sensitive...</li>
<li> but you have to be careful while applying especially the fiber.</li>
<li> They really do extend the eyelashes to an unbelievable length!</li>
<li> Then I applied it and it was like regular mascara and its not all dramatic and pretty.</li>
<li> Complete waste of money!</li>
<li> Although it was a  little dry when I received it, I use one of my old mascara container to assist with breaking the clump down to the point of where I could use it the way it is supposed to be used.</li>

<li> Its add long eye lash, but has very strange order chemical add, so I have hard time to breath.</li>
<li> Yes lashes were a bit fuller - but really not worth the flaking and eye itch.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not so hard to apply, but it takes a long time.</li>

<li> Such poor quality product.  </li>
<li> The fiber wand doesn&#x27;t function properly, so tiny fibers end up haphazardly dropped onto your lashes, with no real way of being applied.  </li>
<li> Use fake lashes or get them done, don&#x27;t even waste your time.</li>
<li> Not good.</li>
<li> lIKE WEARING FALSE EYELASHES</li>
<li> Fibers feel weird and it does not work.</li>
<li> so when you see them here they are probably damaged expired or fake)</li>
<li> but it flakes just like the expensive stuff</li>
<li> I have tried false lashes, but they&#x27;re uncomfortable and just look bad.</li>
<li> not too bad of a product.</li>
<li> I hate to smell the chemical every time using it.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m very disappointed, made my eyelashes look fuzzy also.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! !!</li>
    <li> I love it but I wish is more darker</li>
    <li> did not work for me to messy</li>
    <li> I would NOT recommend this. Works just as good as curling your lashes with a eyelash curler then using mascara right after. I&#x27;m very disappointed, made my eyelashes look fuzzy also. Want a full eyelash look? Use fake lashes or get them done, don&#x27;t even waste your time. Also they try to con you into spending more money so be careful!!! It said my order was only suppose to come to around 8$ &amp; they charged over 20$.</li>
    <li> After seeing so many fiber lash products being advertised lately I went to my go to place (Amazon) to try it. It does take a few tries to get it applied properly but after that it was easy! My lashes definitely looked fuller and longer! I am going to try another brand for comparison purposes but for two sets it was definitely worth the price!</li>
    <li> These are messy if your eyes are sensitive...DONT</li>
    <li> I love this way of making your lashes look longer and it really works!</li>
    <li> not too bad of a product.</li>
    <li> Applied this as soon as it was delivered and I absolutely LOVE it! If applied sparingly, 2 coats is perfect for daily wear. I would put a 3rd coat on if I was going out. For the cost and how quickly it was delivered...this rocks!</li>
    <li> I am a ginger and my lashes are short, thin, and red. I have tried false lashes, but they&#x27;re uncomfortable and just look bad. This looks natural and AMAZING! I LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;-Ashley</li>
    <li> Had a terrible allergic reaction to this product and my eyes were swollen for two days.</li>
    <li> Fibers feel weird and it does not work.</li>
    <li> Not good. Send it back.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the smoothest. It&#x27;s not so hard to apply, but it takes a long time. I only apply once a day when I use it. I don&#x27;t use it everyday. It smudges some. It can irritate my eyes sometimes, especially if a fiber flakes off. Don&#x27;t plan on buying another one.</li>
    <li> They are ok. But I would def if u have the extra money to spend go with the original</li>
    <li> Fibers hey all over the place and does not have the fullness nor the length it advertises.</li>
    <li> Complete waste of money! I guess the old :you get what you pay for&amp;#34; applies here.  The fiber wand doesn&#x27;t function properly, so tiny fibers end up haphazardly dropped onto your lashes, with no real way of being applied.  The mascara isn&#x27;t moist enough to even help.  It definitely does not help to lengthen! A 1 star is being generous</li>
    <li> Not as easy to use as others at a higher price.</li>
    <li> Love it! So much more than regular mascara. I could never go back to regular.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t work... AT ALL!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried lash extensions, falsies, and about a million different mascara-plus-lengthening products. When I tried this one, I was about to go with extensions again (which is WAY more trouble than it&#x27;s worth). I don&#x27;t know whether I will stick with this particular brand forever, but it works great; just about doubles the length of my lashes and makes them fuller. For the price, this is one you should definitely try!</li>
    <li> I love this product I will purchases again</li>
    <li> Love! I use this with regular mascara and it works amazingly!</li>
    <li> It really makes my lashes LONGER.  However, sometimes the little fibers flake off on my cheeks.</li>
    <li> I must admit I am surprised at the high ratings having read through the reviews. One review said they don&#x27;t even use the transplanting gel, but instead use her own mascara. What good is a product if you must use your current product to receive the effect you want? Plus, this is just a knock of of the original (and in my opinion the best) 3D mascara from younique. I&#x27;ve went to lashalert.com and youniqueproducts.com/fastlash and both are guaranteed younique. (if you buy from external sites, the sellers are not permitted to sell here so when you see them here they are probably damaged expired or fake) I would just order the best and save my eyes the risk of trying too many products that don&#x27;t compare anyway.</li>
    <li> Love these! I don&#x27;t use the transplanting gel, I use my regular mascara. These took a little getting used to but I won&#x27;t leave the house without them now!</li>
    <li> I ordered this to test it out because I have been hearing about this type of product. Although it was a  little dry when I received it, I use one of my old mascara container to assist with breaking the clump down to the point of where I could use it the way it is supposed to be used. After applying it, my eyelashes looked false and that made me happy. No need for false eyelashes when you have your own that look that way.</li>
    <li> Such poor quality product.  Took forever to receive Product. It should state the location where the product is coming from. Never again</li>
    <li> Its add long eye lash, but has very strange order chemical add, so I have hard time to breath. I hate to smell the chemical every time using it. Could someone explain to me that is not harmful to your health. Why does most staff ( clothes , cosmetic ) made in China has strong chemical order .</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I was kinda iffy abou paying almost $15 for it but i was like what the heck the reviews look good so I got it. When I recieved it I was surprised to see that there was 2 sets bc I dont think when I ordered it it said that there would be 2 sets sent. Now it says it. It does flake into my eye but it goes away after a little while and it doesnt bother too much. Sooo worth the money. It makes them longer and fuller. My sister also tried mine and lived it and begged me to let her have the other set. I just love it. I will be using this mascara for a long time!!!</li>
    <li> Love the 2 Alpha Love I always get but the 2 new oneas it came with do not work nearly like the original leopard onea. Not quite sure what the difference is but will go back to the 4 pack of the same style.</li>
    <li> the fibers get in your eye and they sting</li>
    <li> When trying this mascara on it work ok but if u really want it to pop I suggest to use ur favorite regular mascara first, then keep repeating with the  transplanting gel, fiber to get the look u really want other then this I probably want buy it again cause I am looking for length, thickness and it don&#x27;t give u the thickness just length instead when it is done right what I had mention above</li>
    <li> Love it but it flakes just like the expensive stuff</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> I got the product pretty fast and did get four mascara in total (2 gel and 2 fiber). It does the job but you have to be careful while applying especially the fiber. You have to apply very well the gel so the the fiber will stay on your lashes and not fall into your eyes.</li>
    <li> My friends were all impressed with this stuff - cheap enough - but honestly made my eyes itch. And flaked onto my contacts. Yes lashes were a bit fuller - but really not worth the flaking and eye itch. BUT my friends that ordered it loved it.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my purchase. Very easy to use and it looks awesome. I would recommend this to people I know for sure.</li>
    <li> lIKE WEARING FALSE EYELASHES</li>
    <li> it is really very good</li>
    <li> This is just like a cheap mascara. There is no 3D Fiber or any longer looking eye lashes to it!</li>
    <li> Love these mascaras! They really do extend the eyelashes to an unbelievable length! And you get two for the price of one! Going to purchase another one!</li>
    <li> I guess I was expecting too much. First it arrived with no pretty case. Then I applied it and it was like regular mascara and its not all dramatic and pretty. It did get a little longer but no instructions. I&#x27;ll keep using and hopefully get better.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing</li>
    <li> Works as well as name brand and cheaper</li>
    <li> fibers continuously fell off lashes and into eyes and on face all day</li>
    <li> Just as described. Great fast service.</li>
