      <li>I am very pleased with this set</li>
      <li>The razor is nice and has a good weight.  </li>
      <li>It has a nice non-slip padding on the bottom and the chrome looks good.  </li>
      <li>and was thrilled to see that the set wasn&#x27;t made of rinky dinky materials.</li>

      <li>and I think it makes a wonderful gift or a great &#x27;entry level&#x27; set for someone just starting their shaving journey.</li>
      <li>Personally I am thrilled with this set.  </li>
      <li>The the razor had a nice weight and so did the brush.  </li>
      <li>The brush is heavier than I was expecting and it feels really nice when holding it.  </li>
      <li>Shipped quick and arrived in great condition.</li>
      <li>On top of that, the brush is amazing.</li>
      <li>The brush dries nicely and the razor is easy to switch out the blades.</li>
      <li>He is pleased with the stand, the razor and the brush.</li>
      <li>and I am happy with that also, but this brush is much softer and it is a floppy brush which I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t wait for my husband to try it! :)</li>
      <li>It was well made and lovely.  </li>
      <li>The razor head remained hot while Iwas shaving, but the handle was nice and cool (still room temperature) and very nice to hold and the handle was not slippery.  </li>
      <li>I was very satisfied when the set arrived (very fast shipping!)</li>
      <li>Easy to change blades too.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have that feeling that it will tip over easily either.  </li>
      <li>and I wanted to make it even better by finding a nice set and shaving supplies for more an old school feel.</li>
      <li>The fit &amp; finish on this component is superb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>If anyone has any recommendations for replacement heads that will fit this set, please let me know!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you are getting it as a gift you might want to also give them some DE razor blades and shaving soap also so they will be able to use it right away (this set does not come with blades).  </li>
      <li>The razor and brush has a nice heavy feel to it and the patterning is etched in and the set looks really nice and stylish sitting out on the counter.</li>
      <li>Awesome product, everything is heavy and nothing looks or feels cheap, shipped right away with Amazon prime and got here in two days</li>
      <li>Got it as a gift for someone, don&#x27;t forget the razors and shaving cream if you&#x27;re getting it as a gift so they can use it right away!</li>
      <li>I was apprehensive when I ordered the set; as it was much cheaper than most Razors by themselves.</li>
      <li>other then that it is great</li>
      <li>The fit and finish on all the components are spot on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Specific to the brush, so far no hairs have fallen out and they have a nice full and soft feel to them.  </li>
      <li>I liked it a lot and decided I would get a Double Edge Safety Razor (DE).  </li>
      <li>Using the same blades (Derby Extra) that I&#x27;ve used for a year in a not-so-nice razor, I was amazed at how great my shave was with just one pass using this razor.  </li>
      <li>This was purchased for Christmas as a gift to my husband and he absolutely loves it!</li>
      <li>Just tried the razor for the first time.</li>
      <li>When I saw the low price point, I assumed this would be more of an &amp;#34;introductory&amp;#34; set with lower quality components.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>(I didn&#x27;t soak the it to the chrome bottom which might get hot, I don&#x27;t know).  </li>
      <li>Not real heavy, but not too light feeling either.  </li>
      <li>then I am used to, but it was very soft and lathered quickly</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t own any other stands, but this seems very nice.&lt;br</li>
      <li>searched high and low for an affordable &#x27;entry level&#x27; set on Amazon that including a shaving bowl, but ended up going for this set due to the decorative and stylish handles and much more affordable cost.</li>
      <li>It shed about 20 - 25 bristles, but I think that is normal for a brush on it&#x27;s first use and by the time I was cleaning it</li>
      <li>I did do my 3rd pass just to get the finishing touch and a perfectly smooth</li>
      <li>He had been wanting a straight razor for some time</li>
      <li>&amp;#34;The weight of the shaver works really well,&amp;#34; he says.</li>
      <li>I received this product in a reasonable timeframe.</li>
      <li>The stand is sturdy and the brush and razor have a nice heavy, quality feel to them.  </li>
      <li>I think it will take a little getting used to but the first shave was very very smooth and close.</li>
      <li>He is new to &#x27;the art of shaving&#x27; and this is his first safety razor set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I always do 3 passes and by the time I was done my second pass, my shave was almost as good as my 3 passes with other razors.  </li>
      <li>Similar to the brush, the fit &amp; finish are really high quality.  </li>
      <li>The handle in this was the same as with the razor, it stays cool</li>
      <li>Highly reccomend this to anyone wanting to try switching over to safety razors</li>
      <li>I did my normal shaving routine</li>
      <li>It shed before the first use and luckily after 4 uses it&#x27;s shedding less.</li>
      <li>I think the company is somewhat new and they had this set on sale to help promote their product and get their name</li>
      <li>- this one had abundant lather with a few, short spins around the mug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I did as much research as I could in a short amount of time on this set and couldn&#x27;t find much feedback or reviews on it.  </li>
      <li>I let it soak in the hot water with my brush for several minutes just</li>
      <li>The brush could be improved as it doesn&#x27;t seem like it has enough bristles, but for the price, is a decent set to get started with a safety razor.</li>
      <li>I get the feeling of this set getting me to my final goal of having a high quality DE razor</li>
      <li>About 3 weeks ago I started wet shaving with soap and a brush for the first time and was using disposable razors.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Since I couldn&#x27;t find much about the set in my research, but the little I did find looked to be mostly positive feedback on the Boss Razor company in general, so I took the gamble and purchased this set.  </li>
      <li>and I am guessing that I have not wet shaved for about 20 years.  </li>
      <li>whole set (DE razor, badger brush, and stand) was the same price as just the razor of the other brand I was going to buy.  </li>

<li> Thought the black handle may be slippery when wet but found no problem while shaving.</li>
<li> I would place the brush quality at about average.</li>

    <li> Awesome product, everything is heavy and nothing looks or feels cheap, shipped right away with Amazon prime and got here in two days</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful set. Heavy, sturdy base is nice and doesn&#x27;t tip over. The brush dries nicely and the razor is easy to switch out the blades. &amp;#34;Great Shave&amp;#34; my husband says. I like that  he doesn&#x27;t suffer with ingrown hairs anymore. Great Item. Shipped quick and arrived in great condition.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a Christmas gift for my husband. He had been wanting a straight razor for some time and I wanted to make it even better by finding a nice set and shaving supplies for more an old school feel. He loves it!!!!</li>
    <li> I received this product in a reasonable timeframe. I was apprehensive when I ordered the set; as it was much cheaper than most Razors by themselves. But, it is a very nice quality razor and brush.</li>
    <li> Using the same blades (Derby Extra) that I&#x27;ve used for a year in a not-so-nice razor, I was amazed at how great my shave was with just one pass using this razor.  The weight of it just felt like it was cutting better with no feeling of snagging or razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had also been using another name brand badger brush, which seemed to take 2+ minutes to work a good lather - this one had abundant lather with a few, short spins around the mug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, this set just looks so.damn.good. sitting on my counter, and I know deep down my wife is a little jealous.</li>
    <li> The only problem that I see fight now is that the razor is not adjustable, that might be a problem for some.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my son who is getting started with wet shaving. He is pleased with the stand, the razor and the brush. I would purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for our anniversary.  He likes the color and the stand.  &amp;#34;The weight of the shaver works really well,&amp;#34; he says. Gives a good close shave.</li>
    <li> I am in my 40&#x27;s and I am guessing that I have not wet shaved for about 20 years.  I hated cartridge razors and just decided to always have a beard using a trimmer and an electric razor.  About 3 weeks ago I started wet shaving with soap and a brush for the first time and was using disposable razors.  I liked it a lot and decided I would get a Double Edge Safety Razor (DE).  I did a lot of research and had finally found the razor I wanted.  I waited to buy it for a few days and when I was finally ready I found this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This whole set (DE razor, badger brush, and stand) was the same price as just the razor of the other brand I was going to buy.  I did as much research as I could in a short amount of time on this set and couldn&#x27;t find much feedback or reviews on it.  I think the company is somewhat new and they had this set on sale to help promote their product and get their name out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I couldn&#x27;t find much about the set in my research, but the little I did find looked to be mostly positive feedback on the Boss Razor company in general, so I took the gamble and purchased this set.  I was wondering if my gamble would be a win or a loss.  Today it arrived and as you can see by my headline, it was a win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very impressed as soon as I opened it and looked everything over.  The the razor had a nice weight and so did the brush.  About a week ago I bought a butterfly opening DE razor and I like it.  This razor is at least twice as heavy as that I would say and I was using an inexpensive boar hair brush and I am happy with that also, but this brush is much softer and it is a floppy brush which I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are different options with this set and I got the one with the black handles with white criss cross design on them and with the chrome center stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** The Razor ** This razor is very nice.  I let it soak in the hot water with my brush for several minutes just as I aways do.  The razor head remained hot while Iwas shaving, but the handle was nice and cool (still room temperature) and very nice to hold and the handle was not slippery.  It feels very solid and has a quality feel that makes me think it will last a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** The Brush **  The brush is heavier than I was expecting and it feels really nice when holding it.  The handle in this was the same as with the razor, it stays cool (I didn&#x27;t soak the it to the chrome bottom which might get hot, I don&#x27;t know).  It lathers faster than my boar brush and feels softer I think.  Just like the razor this has what I would call a quality feel to it.  It shed about 20 - 25 bristles, but I think that is normal for a brush on it&#x27;s first use and by the time I was cleaning it the bristles were not shedding anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** The Stand **  This stand is very nice also.  Not real heavy, but not too light feeling either.  It has a nice non-slip padding on the bottom and the chrome looks good.  The brush and razor fit it perfectly.  It doesn&#x27;t have that feeling that it will tip over easily either.  I don&#x27;t own any other stands, but this seems very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** The Shave **  I did my normal shaving routine so I would have a good comparison.  I also used the blade I have already been using (derby extra).  The brush was very different then I am used to, but it was very soft and lathered quickly (I face lather, not in a bowl).  I always do 3 passes and by the time I was done my second pass, my shave was almost as good as my 3 passes with other razors.  I did do my 3rd pass just to get the finishing touch and a perfectly smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this set with the mindset that I would upgrade the razor at a later time.  At this point I don&#x27;t feel I will be upgrading anytime soon, because this razor and brush seem like they are perfect the way they are.  I would still like to try a synthetic brush at some point, but that has nothing to do with the quality of this set.  This set doesn&#x27;t feel like it is entry level.  I get the feeling of this set getting me to my final goal of having a high quality DE razor already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My final thought on this is if you are thinking about getting this as a gift have no fear.  I can see no reason for anybody to not like this set and I would be more inclined to say anybody that receives this as a gift would be very happy and pleased with it.  Personally I am thrilled with this set.  Just a note.  If you are getting it as a gift you might want to also give them some DE razor blades and shaving soap also so they will be able to use it right away (this set does not come with blades).  I am very pleased with this set and I hope everybody else will have as good of an experience as I did with this shaving set.</li>
    <li> When I saw the low price point, I assumed this would be more of an &amp;#34;introductory&amp;#34; set with lower quality components.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to report this set feels like one in the $100+ range.  The stand is sturdy and the brush and razor have a nice heavy, quality feel to them.  The fit and finish on all the components are spot on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Specific to the brush, so far no hairs have fallen out and they have a nice full and soft feel to them.  The fit &amp; finish on this component is superb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to use the razor, but it looks and feels like a much more expensive variant.  Similar to the brush, the fit &amp; finish are really high quality.  The kits does not come with blades, so just remember to order a set if you don&#x27;t have any.</li>
    <li> Got it as a gift for someone, don&#x27;t forget the razors and shaving cream if you&#x27;re getting it as a gift so they can use it right away!</li>
    <li> It was well made and lovely.  Very nice set and  has a nice feel to it while shaving.  Woudl recommend to any other buyer</li>
    <li> I should have bought the butterfly type. Didn&#x27;t realize what I was buying....my dad always had the butterfly type, which just seems easier to use.</li>
    <li> Great item - looks really good.  Can&#x27;t wait for my husband to try it! :)</li>
    <li> For the price, this safety razor is perfect. Thought the black handle may be slippery when wet but found no problem while shaving. Easy to change blades too. On top of that, the brush is amazing. And of course, this set just looks beautiful.</li>
    <li> This was purchased for Christmas as a gift to my husband and he absolutely loves it! He is new to &#x27;the art of shaving&#x27; and this is his first safety razor set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I searched high and low for an affordable &#x27;entry level&#x27; set on Amazon that including a shaving bowl, but ended up going for this set due to the decorative and stylish handles and much more affordable cost. I was very satisfied when the set arrived (very fast shipping!) and was thrilled to see that the set wasn&#x27;t made of rinky dinky materials. The razor and brush has a nice heavy feel to it and the patterning is etched in and the set looks really nice and stylish sitting out on the counter. I would place the brush quality at about average. It shed before the first use and luckily after 4 uses it&#x27;s shedding less.The manufacturer&#x27;s websites labels the brush as made of Badger hair. Both the razor and brush heads are screw in. If anyone has any recommendations for replacement heads that will fit this set, please let me know!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s a great, affordable, quality set and I think it makes a wonderful gift or a great &#x27;entry level&#x27; set for someone just starting their shaving journey.</li>
    <li> Just tried the razor for the first time. Ive always used cartridge razors and I wanted to try safety razors. This set seemed a good way to try it out. I think it will take a little getting used to but the first shave was very very smooth and close. I paired it with Col. Conks bay rum soap and the smell is perfect. Highly reccomend this to anyone wanting to try switching over to safety razors</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he is very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as an anniversary gift.  I was honestly worried it would look cheap, but I was Very Impressed!  Looks Great, and the best part.....He thought I spent a LOT on it ...  hehe!</li>
    <li> The razor is nice and has a good weight.  The stand works as intended and looks good.  The brush could be improved as it doesn&#x27;t seem like it has enough bristles, but for the price, is a decent set to get started with a safety razor.</li>
    <li> the brush sheds a little bit. other then that it is great</li>
