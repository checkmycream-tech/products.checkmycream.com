      <li>These were not as enjoyable as I had hoped they were.</li>
      <li>I Love These</li>
      <li>what I like about it most, that the lashes are not briddle to the rouch.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for many years.</li>

      <li>Love this mascara.  </li>

      <li>My daughter and I are pleased with the color and the ease of application.  </li>
      <li>I love not having to go to the mall for 1 item.</li>
      <li>Love this mascara.  </li>
      <li>It comes off very easy with mild face wash!</li>
      <li>..when i opened the mascara i noticed it wasn&#x27;t as full as the sample i received from the store and wasn&#x27;t applying as well either..unless these samples are used, they surly aren&#x27;t as good as the free sample i got.</li>
      <li>So far I have been happy with this purchase.  </li>
      <li>Goes on easy and stays one until washed off with face wash.</li>
      <li>it has a strong smell of paint...</li>
      <li>Price is really great in comparison to regular size tube.</li>
      <li>I got a free sample of this mascara when i purchased estee lauder makeup</li>
      <li>SMALL tubes that fit nicely in a purse - great color and coverage.</li>
      <li>but I expect higher end brands to hold a curl better than drugstore.</li>
      <li>Definitely Worth Every Penny!</li>
      <li>It leaves a clean look without clumps or fibers.</li>
      <li>&amp; ive never found a mascara that lengthens, volumizes, doesnt clump &amp; is good till the last bit is used up.</li>
      <li>I was going thru full sized mascaras in weeks</li>
      <li>Very build able and lengthens and gives volume.</li>
      <li>Quality is not bad.</li>
      <li>cause they would dry &amp; out &amp; lose everything good about it, this does not.</li>
      <li>I like Estee Lauder mascare and was glad to fine a smaller size.</li>
      <li>One tube of cheap stuff at the drug store would cost as much as these three.</li>
      <li>Nice but, being this short are not convenient to use.</li>
      <li>The three sample size versions cost around $3.00 for the same product and I&#x27;m thinking that there is more product in the three than there is in the one full size version.  </li>
      <li>I have very straight lashes</li>
      <li>Arrived fast and exactly as described!</li>
      <li>I am going back to More than Mascara also by Estee Lauder.  </li>
      <li>I was able to use the smaller wand I still had leftover from my last tube of More than Mascara to apply this</li>
      <li>Different than pictured, but still love this mascara</li>
      <li>I love this product but a different type came from what was shown in the picture..</li>
      <li>It was exactly what I ordered.  </li>
      <li>I like this brand of mascara and have been willing to pay the department store price.  </li>
      <li>Great deal here versus buying a single larger tube.</li>
      <li>Not clumpy, always well spaced and isn&#x27;t so lasting that I have to special clean my eyes after washing my face.</li>
      <li>you are looking for a quality product at a  ore reasonable price</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m becoming more conscious of fine lines around my eyes and hate the rubbing needed to remove most mascara.</li>
      <li>The mascara works really great and it lasts a pretty long time to be a small tube.</li>
      <li>I love this formula it really gives me the sexy black, full and thick lashes that I think all girls crave.</li>
      <li>the next week not bad.</li>
      <li>I have longer eyelashes, and find the brush style and contour of this particular mascara works WAY BEYOND the competition.</li>
      <li>Easy to wash off with just baby oil or other makeup remover.</li>
      <li>The smaller tubes allow you to keep  fresh.</li>
      <li>I cannot and will not completely turn my back on Estee Lauder because the results are so stunning</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Seemed as if it is dried out.</li>
    <li> I love love love this mascara.  Ordered it and it was a good price.  Received it in just a few days.  It was exactly what I ordered.  Thank you for being so efficient</li>
    <li> I luv luv EL ( gold tube around $30) mascara but these mini tubes were dried out, so no I didn&#x27;t like them at all. maybe at one point they were good but I feel they were old samples sold to me.</li>
    <li> I got this as a sample gift at estee lauder &amp; iam hooked. This stuff is the best mascara ive ever used. Ive tried everything from low end to high end &amp; ive never found a mascara that lengthens, volumizes, doesnt clump &amp; is good till the last bit is used up. I was going thru full sized mascaras in weeks cause they would dry &amp; out &amp; lose everything good about it, this does not. Great stuff, you wont regret trying it ;)</li>
    <li> I wanted a winter bootie, something like timberlands and ordered a pair of these ones, but i have to give them away as i didn&#x27;t like them, winter booties should be more sporty and rough, the nose was too tiny and my feet looked ridiculously small in them, it&#x27;s like cinderella shoes. And the tongue of the boot also has a stupid form, difficult to wrAp. Don&#x27;t recommend</li>
    <li> The white tubes came in stead if the ones pictured. Still works great. Awesome price. I love not having to go to the mall for 1 item.</li>
    <li> Very good product and my favorite mascara now and on. Love it!</li>
    <li> love Estee Lauder&#x27;s mascara!! Like the small tubes because I feel like I will use it up before it goes bad.  Still on the first tube, apply daily for over a month.  Easy to wash off with just baby oil or other makeup remover.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best. A great deal on another fine Estée Lauder product!!&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a quality product at a  ore reasonable price then this is for you.</li>
    <li> Mascara isn&#x27;t that great</li>
    <li> This is a product that I&#x27;ve purchased in the past at the Estee Lauder Counter in a department store at a cost of about $20.  I like this brand of mascara and have been willing to pay the department store price.  The three sample size versions cost around $3.00 for the same product and I&#x27;m thinking that there is more product in the three than there is in the one full size version.  In any case, this is a good deal and I will continue to purchase this way.</li>
    <li> Always have loved Estee Lauder.</li>
    <li> The smaller tubes allow you to keep  fresh. My eyelashes do not break when using this product</li>
    <li> My daughter and I are pleased with the color and the ease of application.  It leaves a clean look without clumps or fibers.</li>
    <li> Handy for your purse or travel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always liked Estee Lauder mascara because of the way it wears.  I really prefer these small sample sizes because they are so much easier to use.  Great for applying.</li>
    <li> Makes your eyes pop! This stuff is great and such a good price in the sampler size.  I use 1 tube for several months!</li>
    <li> Because the tubes are small they seem to dry up faster and become clumpy when applies.</li>
    <li> Great deal here versus buying a single larger tube. I&#x27;ve found myself keeping the remaining two in the fridge to &amp;#34;preserve&amp;#34; them, and using the single. They last a long time. I have longer eyelashes, and find the brush style and contour of this particular mascara works WAY BEYOND the competition. I&#x27;ve tried more expensive and less expensive, and find Sumptuous the one I&#x27;m sticking with. Also, this never gets &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34; on the brush. I&#x27;d recommend Sumptuous and it&#x27;s worth paying extra for the big tube, but the smaller ones are easier to preserve, and I like the maneuverability of a shorter brush.</li>
    <li> I have used this brand of Estee Lauder mascara for years.  What I have bought in department stores I would give 5 stars.  But this came and it is not just the same.  It is clumpier, seems like a different formula.  I would not purchase here again.</li>
    <li> I love this product but a different type came from what was shown in the picture.. The tubes were good instead of blue and it makes me a little nervous that plastic sealing was not on the outside of the tubes showing that no one has opened them</li>
    <li> My wife is always looking for travel size mascara, especially Estee Lauder. It&#x27;s a great product and she loves it.</li>
    <li> I Love These, I Gave One To My Daughter And She Loves It As Well. Definitely Worth Every Penny!</li>
    <li> Best Mascara! I received a sample of this in Macy&#x27;s. I loved how well it goes on and amplifies lashes, but also how easy it is to remove at night! I&#x27;m becoming more conscious of fine lines around my eyes and hate the rubbing needed to remove most mascara. Not the case with this, yet it stays put all day! I like the small sizes so you can open a fresh one frequently and not waste. Price is really great in comparison to regular size tube. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Nice size to carry in your purse</li>
    <li> I got a free sample of this mascara when i purchased estee lauder makeup and it was the best mascara iv ever used! So i saw these online and thought it was a great deal..when i opened the mascara i noticed it wasn&#x27;t as full as the sample i received from the store and wasn&#x27;t applying as well either..unless these samples are used, they surly aren&#x27;t as good as the free sample i got. Kinda disappointed..</li>
    <li> Nice mascara with convenient size. Was not dried out or anything. Should last awhile.</li>
    <li> Cute!!! lil tube, great coverage looks great on I prefer Brown but that&#x27;s not usually offered  I will use it ever once in a while...</li>
    <li> These are truly &#x27;sample sized&#x27;  mascaras. These were not as enjoyable as I had hoped they were. They didn&#x27;t do anything for my lashes either. I have very straight lashes so I know that I may be a tad judgemental but I expect higher end brands to hold a curl better than drugstore. These just didn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
    <li> not coming to destiny</li>
    <li> they are cute and very comfortable, I have it in my purse all the time. I recomend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product. I have been using this product for many years. This was the perfect solution,  ordering thru Amazon&#x27;s mail service verses driving 80 miles to nearest large city.</li>
    <li> everything as advertised and on time</li>
    <li> Different than pictured, but still love this mascara</li>
    <li> Excellent mascara.  No clumpy, flaking or smudging.  Been using this for years....this was a great price.  Would definitely buy this again and again</li>
    <li> I love the control of the shorter wands but the thickness on the lashes was too artificial for me.  I am going back to More than Mascara also by Estee Lauder.  I was able to use the smaller wand I still had leftover from my last tube of More than Mascara to apply this and it worked well but I will not reorder.  I will always do trial size just for the ease of application.  I wish someone would make these in dark brown.  Black is not for everyone.</li>
    <li> Excellent customer service and product! Thank you~</li>
    <li> I like how they are compact and easy to carry in a small wristlet.  Quality is not bad.</li>
    <li> Woe is me. I love this formula it really gives me the sexy black, full and thick lashes that I think all girls crave. However after using the Estee Lauder Sumptuous Bold mascara for a few weeks I started to develop styes on my left eye. Imagine my dismay at having to discard an entire tube of the stuff.  I cannot and will not completely turn my back on Estee Lauder because the results are so stunning but I will proceed with caution so as not to disrupt my normal eye functioning.</li>
    <li> Awesome price, looks great, fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Nice but, being this short are not convenient to use.</li>
    <li> Good price for Sumptous mascara.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara.  Does not run or smear.</li>
    <li> Awesome mascara. Prefer waterproof but this is almost as good. Wears all day, easy to remove and excellent price. One tube of cheap stuff at the drug store would cost as much as these three.</li>
    <li> SMALL tubes that fit nicely in a purse - great color and coverage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the product was old or what, but it was nothing like the Estee Lauder samples I usually get (with free gift at the department store).  Seemed to hardly have any mascara in them...would never order again.</li>
    <li> The tubes do not look like the picture.  Perhaps they have changed packaging without updating the photo.  I received white tubes.</li>
    <li> I love Estee Lauder mascara and for me these are absolutely perfect. Instead of paying full price for one big tube, I get three small ones for cheap so I can take one with me when I go.</li>
    <li> Great buy! The mascara works really great and it lasts a pretty long time to be a small tube. Best mascara I have used in a while!</li>
    <li> Awesome mascara. Not flaky, very black. Goes on easy and stays one until washed off with face wash. I am super happy.</li>
    <li> Awesome mascara! I&#x27;ve been using it for years. It comes off very easy with mild face wash! Doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
    <li> Liked the price, timely delivery, but seemed a little dried out when I used them. Maybe it was almost out of date, not sure.</li>
    <li> So far I have been happy with this purchase.  I really like Estee Lauder mascaras because they don&#x27;t flake, but it can be rather expensive.  The price here is great!  I also like the small containers too.  It&#x27;s great for travel.</li>
    <li> Terrible they were dried up.</li>
    <li> I use mascara once a week for church. It was great the first day. the next week not bad. The week after, no, flaky and bad. Cheaper than any mascara I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I really love estee Lauder makeup and these miniture mascaras are wonderful.  I like the size as they are eas to use.</li>
    <li> GREAT! Arrived fast and exactly as described!</li>
    <li> Not clumpy, always well spaced and isn&#x27;t so lasting that I have to special clean my eyes after washing my face.</li>
    <li> Great Bold mascara! Will make eanyones eyes stand out.&lt;br /&gt;Cons_ you don&#x27;t want to get any of this stuff into your eyes...major pain.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this mascara to anyone. I like the smaller tubes because it doesn&#x27;t dry out as fast and looks fresh everytime you put it on.</li>
    <li> what I like about it most, that the lashes are not briddle to the rouch. To bad there is still some cluping .</li>
    <li> I like Estee Lauder mascare and was glad to fine a smaller size.</li>
    <li> it has a strong smell of paint...</li>
    <li> Love this mascara.  Very build able and lengthens and gives volume.</li>
    <li> I think this was a great deal.</li>
