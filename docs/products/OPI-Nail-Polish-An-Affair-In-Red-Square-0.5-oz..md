    <li> The quality of Opi doesn&#x27;t need further testimony - it&#x27;s the best.  The only problem is that the brush insert came off the top screw and I can&#x27;t get it back in there so I have to handle it by it&#x27;s little plastic tip.  Not good.  The color, \\&quot;An Affair in Red Square\\&quot; is a rich, deep, warm red with a slight gold shimmer.  The red color is very similar to \\&quot;Vodka and Caviar\\&quot; but opaque and shimmery.</li>
    <li> Only reason for the three stars is because it isn&#x27;t the color for me. It&#x27;s too orangey red for my tastes, but probably would be great on someone else who likes that color. It has a metallic sheen to it, which was nice. Opi is a great polish; this one just wasn&#x27;t for me. I wound up buying Vodka and Caviar, which is a stunning red that I fell in love with.</li>
    <li> Covers well in one coat and is the perfect shade of classic red.  This color would work with nearly every skin tone.  It is a must-have addition to your home mani/pedi collection.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect bright color to bring out pale skin that does not need any pink getting in the way. It probably looks good on other skin tones, but I was impressed by it because it is so hard to find a color to wear with my shade of pale skin -- they keep trying to put pink on us!</li>

    <li> This color is a perfect shade of red. My favorite to wear over the holidays. It&#x27;s also OPI, so it goes on easily with that nice big brush and lasts pretty well. The seller also packed it well and I got the package very fast.</li>
    <li> ...and this is my favorite, favorite red!  I get compliments on it every time I wear it--and that&#x27;s always nice!</li>
    <li> Just a perfect fall color for the toes. It goes with most fall clothes.  My friend was wearing it so I ordered a bottle for me.</li>
    <li> Perfect metallic red.  Love the formula and color.  Goes on super smooth, lasts a full week with base and top coat.</li>
    <li> Saw this color on a woman and I could not find it in our local stores.  I was so thrilled when Amazon came thru for me once again.  This color just seems to be the perfect red for me with just the right amount of shimmer but not too blingy!!! It stays and does not chip or fade, I am very happy with the quality of this product and the quick delivery I received.  Thank you Amazon and Amazon seller.</li>

    <li> this is the best color red ever!!! its great for any time of the year and perfect for special events. I bought from amazon,and had very good service!</li>
    <li> I receive countless compliments every time I wear the polish.  The times I have taken it with me to the nail salon, the nail tech always checks out the name and shows it to the salon owner/operator.  Perfect for the holidays as well as other times of the year.</li>
    <li> my all time favorite deep red - it goes with most anything!</li>
