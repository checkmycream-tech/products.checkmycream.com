<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This cream is amazingly good. I am so happy with it I also use now the similar body lotion. It relieves the pain associated with cracked dry skin right away, and in the long run the skin heals faster.</li>
    <li> Eurcerin Dry Skin Therapy Plus Intensive Repair Hand Cream is the best stuff I have used for my hands. In the winter, my hands get extremely dry to the point that they crack and bleed. I had tried a nice number of lotions, some that even smelled bad, with little results. One day, I was at the doctor&#x27;s office and I decided that I would try a sample on my chapped hands. I tried it and I finally started seeing results. This was around five years ago, and to this day, I continue to buy Eurcerin. It goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t make my hands sticky which is very nice. It goes on clear and doesn&#x27;t leave my hands white until I rub it in. It doesn&#x27;t really smell, at least not strongly. Best of all, it really works. I put it on at night, before I go to bed and it helps prevent chapness. If I still get chapped, then I apply more throughout the day. The only reason why I give it four stars is because it only comes in pathetically small containers. I go through around three to four bottles each winter and it gets expensive! I didn&#x27;t buy my Eurcerin on amazon. I bought each cream separately. I think they should make a big bottle of it, just like they do with the calming cream and the full body cream.</li>
    <li> Works great used once a day ,best we have tried , will order more when we start to run low .</li>
    <li> I use Intensive repair lotion everyday after shower. Sometimes I miss a spot or two while in a hurry. So I keep this tube in the car with me for emergency use. The lotion is perfect for people with dry skin.</li>
    <li> This packaging and creme works well for me during the winter. I have one in each car, the office and at home.</li>
    <li> I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;I am hard on my hands - I handle a lot of boxes, unpacking, packing, dust, cleaning, washing, gardening and so on.&lt;br /&gt;My hands are extremely dry in winters and even in summer. But this keeps my hand moist and my skin elastic - so you won&#x27;t get cracked skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have one of these in my car, kitchen, study, my night table, purse, everywhere.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve become addicted to hand cream since my nail obsession has taken over, its part of my nail care ritual now. I also handle cash at work and all the hand washing has really started to take a toll on my hands, this brings back my hands to a soft healthy texture. The only con is that it takes a while to completely absorb, I couldn&#x27;t open a bottle of juice yesterday because my hands were so slippery. But it does have a cool waxy buttery feel to it in the middle of being absorbed. It has a light clean scent. My favorite cream so far, surpasses L&#x27;occtaine.</li>
    <li> I always have super dry hands and I&#x27;ve tried sooo many different kinds of lotions and creams. Aquaphor is too greasy, Kiehls is too pricey, others are too smelly. Eucerin is fragrance-free, absorbs instantly, keeps my hands super soft. I absolutely love it. I keep one tube at my desk and one in my purse. Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m rather suprised that I&#x27;m the only one so far who has had this experience, but this lotion smells absolutely awful to me. My husband actually accused me of breaking wind, until I proved my innocence with the terrible hand lotion. I wish I were kidding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also feels rather chemically harsh, like it&#x27;s burning my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it at Sam&#x27;s Club in a sealed 3-pack, so I never had the opportunity to smell the lotion before I made my purchase. I will never buy this again. I will, however, sniff it the next time I see it at a drugstore, to see if perhaps I had a bad batch.</li>
    <li> I discovered this hand lotion a few years ago while I was working as a nanny. The frequent hand washes combined with the cold weather left my hands extremely dry and flaky, to the point where my knuckles were actually cracking and bleeding. None of the lotions that I had helped the problem at all, so I headed to the store and decided to try Eucerin Intensive Repair Hand Creme. By the next day, my hands in better condition than they had ever been! The cracking and flaking were completely gone, and my hands were soft and moisturized! It absorbes quickly, and never leaves skin feeling slick or greasy. It&#x27;s the only hand lotion I&#x27;ll ever use!</li>
    <li> My immune system stinks, so I wash my hands approximately 15 to 20 times each day. Around September my hands start to get dry and then in October they start to crack. By November my hands are chapped and by the end of each day they are usually bleeding. I&#x27;ve tried everything from overnight treatments to rescue hand creams to plain old vaseline and nothing has actually worked. My hands were never fixed, but just covered up, so the next time I washed them I was back to square one. Even taking a shower was painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The very first time I tried Eucerin it was like adding a protective coating to my knuckles. When I washed my hands they felt clean, but my hands did not sting or burn. The best part, Eucerin does not feel heavy or greasy and there is no scent. I feel completely comfortable putting Eucerin on and then working on a knitting project or doing the laundry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have over 15 years of damage to fix and I&#x27;ve only been using Eucerin Intensive Repair for a couple weeks, but so far I&#x27;ve found that putting a little bit on after every time I wash my hands works best. I also put a little on right before I go to bed. I also just ordered the Eucerin Intensive Repair Lotion to fix my eczema.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised nobody&#x27;s mentioned the REAL reason they like this so much: it absorbs quickly, the fastest on the market. This is due to the presence of AhA, or alpha hydroxy acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it, but AhA makes you more susceptible to sunburn so it&#x27;s not good if you&#x27;re outdoors! 4 stars for a version not being made available with an SPF!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the bad smell some people experienced -- Eucerin lotions have plenty of Urea, an excellent (and pricey) moisturizer (explanation: [...]). It&#x27;s why Eucerin costs double of, say, a Curel or Vaseline brand lotion. It&#x27;s not marketing, it&#x27;s ingredients!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Urea is not fresh -- if it&#x27;s sat in a warehouse or on the shelf -- it&#x27;s stinky. Not knock-you-over-dead stinky, just lightly so. Still as effective, just a tad annoying is all.</li>
    <li> Excellent cream leaves the skin very soft and has no strong odor. It is very moisturizing, and the price for a 4 pack is the best.</li>
    <li> This is the only hand cream that helps my hands survive winter. I tried 10 different hand creams until my dermatologist suggested this one and from that moment on I only use Eucerin Hand Cream.&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin and even mention of cold weather gets my hands all chopped and bleeding. Since I started using this cream all my problems went away and I can finally survive winters without pain in my hands :).&lt;br /&gt;I recommended this cream to all my friends.</li>
    <li> GREAT product for dry hands espec during the winter months.  Dermatologist recommended.  Eucerin has a all over body creme w/ oatmeal that hydrates your skin.</li>
    <li> We originally got this cream as a sample with a bottle of regular Eucerin, and it laid around the house for almost a year before I tossed it in my bag as we were leaving for vacation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had I any clue how good this was, I would never have let it sit.&#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both my husband and I have dry hands--particularly in winter--and we have used almost every cream we have found, but this is our new favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not at all greasy, absorbs quickly, and leaves your skin very soft and smooth. After regularly using it through the winter, I have not had a single instance of cracking and bleeding on my hands, which I normally would have had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you happen to use too much, you will get some exfoliation, but it is easily rubbed off in seconds--and is a benefit, not a drawback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has also helped to diminish a small scar on my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The four-pack is perfect for us, as we can distribute them where we need them most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this for anyone with severely dry skin, or anyone who wants a good cream to make their hands soft and young-looking.</li>
    <li> it is very thick and almost greesy- but BOY O BOY it is an intensive repair. i use it on my arms and it keeps them smooth all day. love it!</li>
    <li> My hands are constantly dry and cracked. If i use this product daily they are soft and normal looking. However if I skip even one day they get dry again. Have tried every other hand cream out there and nothing else works. I just ordered more and think Im going to have to start using it on dry areas on my face. Just wish it came in bigger size.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this hand creme, and my hand bag is never without it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s perfect for applying anywhere and at anytime.&lt;br /&gt;No scent to bother anyone, no greasy post application mess.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s thick, it&#x27;s creamy, it truly soaks into the skin and leaves it feeling soooo soft and soooo smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I only wish it came in a bigger size with a pump, (and with a lower price tag), so I could keep it by sinks, the couch, the kitchen table, anywhere my hands are!</li>
    <li> ...because it&#x27;s not greasy, soaks right in, and no girly smell.  Of course, it also does a great job on his work-roughened hands.</li>
    <li> I got this hand creme b/c my mom has been using them for months now. She loves it so much that she wants me to start using it. I bought a pack of 4 so I can share them w/ my mom.  I wash dishes by hand so my hands are always dry from the harsh dish soap and I used other hand creme but this one is amazing, leaves your skin soft and it not oily like the other hand creame products. It absorbs quickly and leaves your skin so soft. Buy it, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Preface: I have two little ones, and wash my hands a lot. I also have mild allergies and am sensitive to anything with perfumes or dyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review: My hands have small patches of eczema on the knuckles and between a few fingers. They are generally dry and cracked from over-washing.  I keep this tube by the sink and apply right after washing my hands. In one day, the patches cleared and my hands are returning to normal-looking human hands again. For anyone who suffers from a similar condition, I can&#x27;t tell you how much of a relief this is! Had someone told me about this hand cream sooner, I would have used it as preventative maintenance in advance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this and will tell my friends/family about it, too.</li>
    <li> I always buy this for dry hands and nails that easily develope hang nails due to dry conditions. This is the best treatment i&#x27;ve found. Buying the 4-pack was the best deal price wise i came across. Way less than wally world.</li>
    <li> the best product for dry hands in winter</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really different than any cream I&#x27;ve ever used&lt;br /&gt;Thanks eucerin for all ur products and specially this one and the one with the smoothing essence&lt;br /&gt;They work nicely on the skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like them</li>
    <li> I work with my hands, and this is the only lotion I&#x27;ve found that keeps them soft and moisturized, even throughout a harsh winter. It absorbs quickly, with no post-application greasiness, and (a big plus for me) no odor! This stuff is perfect! I keep bottles of it handy at home, at work, and in my bag. Even the Significant Other loves it, and he&#x27;s not a lotion fan. My only complaint is that I can&#x27;t buy this stuff by the gallon jug.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff. It keeps her hands silky smooth...;)</li>
    <li> Excellent ointment for the treatment of my working fingers that tend to be too dry, leading to cracking and peeling.</li>
    <li> I bought a tube of this hand cream in my local drugstore about 1 or 2 months ago, because my hands are extremely dry and rough.  I decided to try this out after reading many positive reviews online. Despite what the tube claims, \\&quot;smoothes &amp; repairs dry, rough hands with no greasy after feel\\&quot;, my hands are still rough and somewhat dry. Upon applying, your hands feel greasy. This goes away after rubbing it in for about 15 seconds. This hand cream does moisturize, but it was a disappointment. (I was expecting more from reading the back of the tube.) The lotion smells a bit like plastic before it fully absorbs into the skin. (You won&#x27;t notice unless your purposely sniff you hand like I did.) A little goes a long way. I still have more than half of the product still in the tube. For $4.67, I think it was a good buy and will continue to purchase until I find something better. (:</li>
    <li> I read others&#x27; review for this item. It is true to what said there. My hands are dry and after using it I do feel them more soft and moistured. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Great for dry hands in our desertclimate</li>
    <li> I love this cream, I have a dog, and always in water and it is the only dry skin cream that keeps my hands comfortable.  I researched and found on Amazon a way to save a few pennies which is always nice and with being a prime item, well worth it.  Thank You.</li>
    <li> My husband swears by this product.he uses it all the time. It has kept his dry hands and fingers from cracking, and, irritated  , they can get so red. We live in WA state, and, visit CA for some of the year. The weather is is so drying.</li>
    <li> This is a good product with good traveling size.  This is fragrant free so it is good for people with nazal allergy.</li>
    <li> Rich and creamy, yet not too thick.  It is almost non-scented, which is exactly what I was looking for.  Price is great, too!  The size is perfect to carry in my purse.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this hand cream - it really is the best that I have found so far! I have had a problem with dry hands for many years and have tried over 20 different hand creams ranging from drug store brands to expensive beauty brands. Hands down - Eucerin is the best.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not greasy nor does it just sit on your hands like some of the other popular brands.</li>
    <li> Useful on feet as well as hands.  Price is good, delivered promptly.  Saves gas and time as well as money to order online....no down side.</li>
    <li> When my husband had radiation on his neck, the hospital staff made sure we had plenty of Eucerin and Aquaphor to apply to the burns. He has no scars and that was years ago. Since then, we keep it on hand, and this is the only brand of lotion I buy. I&#x27;ve given it to my children&#x27;s families and keep some in my purse.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. No stink, and it really helps my desert dry hands! I plan to buy some as gifts, no kidding!</li>
    <li> This is the stuff that works. For about 6-8 years now (I&#x27;m 54) I&#x27;ve had problems with the back of my hand(s) in wintertime--atopic eczema, chapping, dryness, red welts, blisters, severe itching. The first key to good care is to apply a cream IMMEDIATELY after washing or wetting your hands for any reason--within 2-3 minutes at most. Be sure to do that religiously no matter what moisturizing cream you use (a doctor told me this and it&#x27;s a good tip). Don&#x27;t let you hands dry naturally from a wetting--blot or towel dry and then apply cream right away. (Don&#x27;t forget after showering.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used and tried many creams for my condition and had this one (Eucerin Plus) around for a long time without quite \\&quot;getting\\&quot; how to use it. When I&#x27;d use it occasionally, it would sting and burn and didn&#x27;t seem to work very well--seemed to sort of accentuate the redness. Well, I was using it wrong. Occasional applications just START to heal your hands without helping them heal all the way. The key to this product is to keep using it and use it LOTS, like several to many times a day. If I do that, my hands heal to the point where the cream doesn&#x27;t sting any more at all and my hands heal remarkably well--my skin looks and feels completely normal, just like they are in summer except a little softer and smoother. First time for that in a number of years for me, in the winter. This product really works once you figure out how to use it most effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My problem is that once my hands heal completely I start forgetting to use it until the problems start again, but that&#x27;s a problem with me, not the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I have never even noticed any bad smell, as another reviewer complained about, but then I don&#x27;t have a very good sense of smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review helps somebody out there...bad \\&quot;winter hands\\&quot; is a condition that is naggingly painful and uncomfortable if left untreated. This works for me.</li>
    <li> I got a free sample of this hand cream at my doctor&#x27;s office, but I never use any skin products without checking them on Cosmetics Database [...]&lt;br /&gt;This product contains heavy metals and has use restrictions. There are much safer options. I threw my free sample in the garbage.</li>
    <li> I first took the Hand Creme title seriously, and called it a &amp;#34;Super Lubriderm&amp;#34;.  Then I saw at the bottom of the tube, &amp;#34;foot.&amp;#34;  Am I glad I made the switch.  It&#x27;s sensational for smoothing the roughest parts like the heels and does wonders between the toes.  My manicurist asked me last time, &amp;#34;Who&#x27;s been working on your feet?&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I like it, but not what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
    <li> For such an &amp;#34;intensive&amp;#34; hand creme, I love that this absorbs quickly and spreads without effort (most serious hand cremes take some muscle to rub in completely).  It does not leave my hands greasy, so I can go on with my work without dabbing my fingertips on a tissue.  A little goes a long way, too:  a little dollop usually takes me up to my forearms for moisturizing.  I will definitely re-purchase.</li>
    <li> Eucerin Intensive Repair Extra-Enriched Hand Creme is the best hand cream by far! I have dry skin year round and in the winter the skin on my hands gets painfully dry, chapped and cracked. After only one use, my hands already felt smoother and silkier, yet without the greasy feeling that so many hand creams have. Also, I have sensitive skin and I did NOT have any allergic reaction to this cream. I would recommend this product for anyone!</li>
    <li> This is a good product for removing rough patches on your hands as well as moisturizing.  The small tube fits in your purse.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and this cream is the only thing that works for me!!</li>
    <li> I have very dry and sensitive hands and feet as a result of a chemotherapy drug I take. I like this cream because it absorbs easily, is very moisturizing. I was told that the content urea was important for a real moisturizing cream.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat this product for this price.  Applies on easily and does not give a greasy feel.  Effectively reduces dryness.  Excellent buy!</li>
    <li> This winter, areas on my hands were forming blisters, and in general my hands were dry, tender, cracked and bleeding.  It seemed my hands had become extremely sensitive to dust, and to the chemicals in anit-bacterial wipes. The dry indoor winter air was not helping, either.  My standard hand lotion provided no relief, neither did several other lotions. Since nothing else was working, I tried what my son has used for years, Eucerin Intensive Repair Hand Cream. It was a last resort before seeking my doctor&#x27;s help.  To my amazement The Eucerin Intensive Repair Hand Cream worked instantly!  I was so pleased I started using it every night, and it was only a few nights before the problems that had plagued me for months, were entirely gone; my hands were amazingly soft and moisturized.  All the rough, cracked areas gone.  I love this product!  It&#x27;s amazing!  Note, it takes a few minutes for the hand cream to absorb completely.  Using it before bed is no big deal, and it insures the hand cream has a long time to protect your hands.</li>
    <li> this hand cream is a wonderful product. My hands used to get so dry in winter and looked so bad. I tried many kinds of hand cream before I discovered Eucerin Hand Cream. Most of the other hand creams are either too greasy, or don&#x27;t work well, or are easily washed out after handwash. Eucerin, on the other hand, is light yet effective. After using this hand cream, my hands stay hydrated and the skin looks so soft and young! Even my dad who doesn&#x27;t really use any beauty products likes this hand cream and said good things about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad that I found this product. Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without this hand cream - especially in the winter in New England. It&#x27;s a nicely balanced moisturizer, not too creamy and it absorbs quickly without leaving a sticky residue that some other &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; hand creams leave. I use it daily on my hands + face.</li>
    <li> I tried different kinds of lotion, and none of them would help my dryness from the winter, this is the only one that did it, and now I do not have to go to a dermatologist! I saved lots of $$$</li>
    <li> No more bleeding, cracking hands in the winter. This was recommended by my doctor. I tell all my friends about it.</li>
    <li> My doctor recommended this product.  The price is unbeatable at Amazon.  The product works great...not greasy.  Leaves hands soft and beautiful!</li>
    <li> Portable.  Nothing so special.  Worked as expected</li>
    <li> The best hand cream ever use. My hand is very dry even in summer, this one help me a lot. Keep the hand moisture. Good to try it. It will not disappointing you.</li>
    <li> I really do love this stuff. I have a tube at work, one in my backpack, and a bunch at home. I work in a hospital and sometimes end up scrubbing in up to 6+ times a day. My hands and lower arms dry out so much it hurts some days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff doesn&#x27;t smell and completely remedies my dried out skin (until the next deadly scrub) but most importantly isn&#x27;t greasy. That wouldn&#x27;t fly well in my procedure area and with what I&#x27;m doing/handling. It leaves my skin literally feeling like silk but doesn&#x27;t leave anything behind even on touch screens. This stuff is the bees knees.</li>
    <li> Even though this is a little more expensive than other lotions you might find at the drugstore, it is worth the money. A little bit goes a long way, and it is less greasy feeling than other lotions I have tried.</li>
    <li> This is the best hand lotion I have ever used. It glides on nicely and is non-greasy. Although most lotions will say they&#x27;re non-greasy, you usually feel some slickness left on your hand after rubbing it in, but not with this one. I apply it and within two seconds, the creme has set in and my hands feel hydrated and smooth. My hands get so dry during winters so this lotion has been a true blessing. It moisturizes for pretty long too. However, I don&#x27;t often go too long without getting my hands wet (washing hands after using the bathroom, washing dishes, etc.) so I apply lotion often. I would love to use this all the time, but it&#x27;s quite pricey (About $5.50 for a 2.5 oz versus a 16 oz bottle of regular Cetaphil lotion for $10 at Target) and since I&#x27;m constantly getting my hands wet and having to reapply, I run out of the small 2.5 oz tube quite fast and I don&#x27;t always run to the store to get a new one. I wish they would sell this in a big bottle so could have something on my desk at work and on my nightstand at home that would last awhile (even if that bottle was expensive). It&#x27;s worth the money but use it wisely.</li>
    <li> makes hands feel good. The size is perfect for keeping it in purse, at work, in drawer, in backpack.  feels good</li>
    <li> I looked at the reviews regarding skin cream and this one came up second place, I love it, its feels nice, its not sticky, not greasy it soaks into my hands and arms and its improving my skin. I bought the four pack because of the value and I keep on in my purse, on in my back pack for when I am out hiking or helping. Great cream, great price...</li>
    <li> Thick, but not greasy. My hands are noticeably better off after using it. I sometimes use it on my face at night.</li>
    <li> I live in NYC and we have cold, blustery winters.  My skin is naturally dry and is even sometimes dry in the summer months.  My hands were already getting chapped and bleeding as the winter started this year and they were starting to look old and wrinkly and I am too young to have wrinkly hands!  None of the lotions in my apt were working.  I tried Curel, Ahava, and even a prescription level lotion given to me by my dermatologist.  I went to the drugstore and bought this on a whim because I had tried Eucerin&#x27;s foot creme in the past and knew it to work.  I was amazed at how quickly this creme worked.  First of all, it&#x27;s not greasy at all and absorbs quickly so I doesn&#x27;t make me dread putting it on.  Secondly, it healed my hands in one use.  I have been using it every day now for 5 days and my hands look once again young, smooth, and completely hydrated.  I am planning to buy this product from Amazon in the 4 pack because the price is good (at the drugstore, I paid $8 for one tube) and I want to have one tube in every location, my purse, at work, at home, and in my gym bag!</li>
    <li> I use it multiple times a day.  I also buy the body lotion that comes in a pump. Very good product, recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
    <li> I live in the desert and one application of this product softens and moiturises my extremely hands wonderfully.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I live in the cold midwest and after having a baby in January and constantly washing my hands, my hands were completely destroyed. They were cracked, bleeding and sore. The only hand cream that worked was Eucerin Intensive Repair. It worked quickly; I noticed results after only one application. It&#x27;s not at all greasy so I can slather it on and start typing on my keyboard right away. I love the 2.7 oz size so I can carry it with me wherever I go.</li>
    <li> My hands feel so soft after using it. I like it because it doesn&#x27;t smell and leave no sticky feelling. The size is handy and I ordered the 4pk that I can put one in my purse and one in the bathroom.</li>
    <li> This is my second order for hand cream which is supposed to be &amp;#34;PLUS&amp;#34;.  What came twice now is simply Intensive Repair hand enriched cream.  Why advertise for a product if you don&#x27;t carry it?</li>
    <li> One of the few cremes I like to use because it does not smell and it works not only to creme but also to repair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great! It is not greasy and is absorbed into the skin quickly leaving skin soft. It was recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
    <li> After trying several different hand lotions, the most recent being [[ASIN:B003JT4S7U Lubriderm Advanced Therapy Lotion, 24 Ounce]], I was skeptical that a hand lotion could absorb quickly yet moisturize my dry, cracked hands effectively. I was very surprised to find that the Eucerin hand creme does just that! The Lubriderm was too thick and stayed on my hands too long after applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Eucerin cream has the consistency of shave gel, which makes it easy to apply. It is fully absorbed into my hands in a manner of minutes, meaning I can apply it all over my hands without getting it on everything I touch. After only one applications, the backs of my hands were noticeably smoother, and over a few days the cracking subsided. If you have severely cracked and dry hands like I do, or wash your hands a lot, you will need to be judicious in how often you apply it, but the improvement is impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my new favorite hand creme, and the 4-pack from Amazon is well-priced and convenient.</li>
    <li> This has one of the ingredients that are recommended for aging skin -- and my skin is 66 years old.  I intend to continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product as it smooths and soothes skin without a greasy feel.</li>
    <li> Normally, I love Eucerin products. I use the Daily Replenshing Lotion and the Intensive Repair Foot Creme on a daily basis. The Hand Creme was a big disappointment. It is extremely greasy and does not absorb well into the skin. I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> This products seems to work well, it has helped with my dry cracked hands but it is not 100% non greasy.</li>
