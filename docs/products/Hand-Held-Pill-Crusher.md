      <li>This is the best pill crusher I have found.  </li>
      <li>though....makes for great wrist and forearm muscles exercise!</li>
      <li>i found the perfect pill crusher.</li>
      <li>I have to say it works great!!!</li>
      <li>Not the best.  </li>
      <li>Best on the market I have seen</li>
      <li>very good pill crusher for the price.</li>
      <li>On the plus side, it operates with great ease.</li>
      <li>Product arrived in a timely manner and in good shape.</li>
      <li>Excellent product, my mother in law use it like 10 times a day, worth the price.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased.</li>
      <li>++Very easy to use  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s okay</li>
      <li>After a year the top handle started splitting from the bowl.  </li>
      <li>The cheaper 6 dollar ergo Grip Crushers work much better</li>
      <li>the crusher must be pretty good, because someone stole it...</li>
      <li>+Coated with what appears to be enamel so that the pill never touches metal, which is good because metal can react with and neutralize certain medications    </li>
      <li>I can use it easily, it crushes the biggest and hardest pills and it stores easily.  </li>
      <li>+Crushes very quickly  </li>
      <li>Works as advertised, easy to use,</li>
      <li>Also, the way it opens allows you to insert the largest of pills easily.    </li>
      <li>Maybe I just too strong.  </li>
      <li>Strong like bull.  </li>
      <li>this one gets it fine, but not always super-fine.  </li>
      <li>+Easy to clean</li>
      <li>We were crushing pills using a hammer.  </li>
      <li>Be aware that if you need very fine powder (like for a flexiflo tube) then you may have to use a twist-type....</li>
      <li>In its original packaging and crush it or put it in pill crusher plastic sleeve packet and crush it.</li>
      <li>I  am a woman in my late seventies, somewhat frail,  and not always in the best of health.  </li>
      <li>You do need a good supply of tiny zipper bags, as they are ruined with each use, but they are inexpensive and keep all the contents contained.  </li>
      <li>If you crush one end and turn pill around and crush the other way this is a great unit and well made.</li>
      <li>It good and sturdy item, very useful for people who do not want to swallow big pills, I would certainly recommend others to buy it.</li>
      <li>I like the sturdy, thick metal construction of this unit, but it doesn&#x27;t do a good job crushing pills in the sense of crushing them into a powder.</li>
      <li>with this I save a lot of time and it really works !</li>
      <li>The plastic bags are first off impractical for me as you can only do so many pills in a bag</li>
      <li>This item worked pretty good - left some larger chunks but much better than the twisting plastic ones that leave pieces of blue plastic in the medicine.</li>
      <li>+Accommodates large pills  </li>
      <li>I bought this because I was struggling with the cheap plastic pill grinder bought from a local drug store.</li>
      <li>I much appreciate this product.</li>
      <li>Too much torque.  </li>
      <li>This crusher works very well.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended if you don&#x27;t need your pills crushed into a fine, consistent powder.</li>
      <li>(You shouldn&#x27;t need to clean it if you place the pill into one of the little baggies provided, but if you don&#x27;t use the bags, it still cleans off with just a quick wipe.)  </li>
      <li>Takes a certain amount of hand strength, but not excessive.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still much better than not crushing them at all, because of course the chunks are much smaller than the original tablet and therefore easier to swallow.</li>
      <li>The crushing surfaces do get tacky with pill residue but a little warm water and air dry gets everything ready for the next go-round.</li>
      <li>It seems like this would have been a bad review, but the fact remains that this was the best pill crusher I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re concerned about absorption, small chunks should dissolve much more rapidly than a whole pill.    </li>
      <li>have only been using this for a few days, so I can&#x27;t comment on how sturdy it may be except to say that it *seems* very strong.  </li>
      <li>It is heavy and made of metal, not the type of plastic that often breaks easily.</li>
      <li>It was reasonably priced but I was surprised when it actually broke.</li>
      <li>It is pretty sturdy as long as you don&#x27;t put tons of torque into it.  </li>
      <li>It is very sturdy and I think it will last practically forever.</li>
      <li>Very sturdy construction, should last a lifetime  </li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t think crushing 2 pills twice a day is excessive wear and tear.</li>
      <li>The pharmacy sold crushers leave me with the funny feeling that some of the plastic spikes that crush might desintegrate over time, adding unwanted plastic particles in the crushed pill.</li>
      <li>And with little strength in my hands I can only squeeze so much and have to do one or two pills at a time.</li>

<li> Chunks too big to go down G tube.</li>
<li> Therefor not cross contaminating it with other meds for other patients.</li>
<li> I use this at work every single day !</li>
<li> Really sturdy little pill crusher on small to medium size pills, but being a bit feeble in my older age, it is difficult for me to crush large pills.  </li>
<li> This crusher worked well, but started to bend after a while, and like the other reviewer said, the handle would have eventually split from the bowl.  </li>
<li> I barely had to squeeze at all to crush my hard calcium tabs that have broken several plastic pill crushers or grinders (sometimes after one single use.)</li>
<li> I was using a crab hammer to smash the pills, and needless to say the whole family is grateful</li>
<li> It is less messy than the twist cup type.</li>
<li> It seemed heavy duty -</li>
<li> It crushes them into chunks of varying sizes, from about the size of a lentil down to powder size, so you get a sort of mix of powder and small bits of gravel.    </li>
<li> I use this crusher and finish with a small pestle that I bought in Amazon.</li>
<li> The hand held crusher is not very good for this purpose.  </li>
<li> --Does not crush hard pills evenly, leaves chunks instead of an even powder      BOTTOM LINE:</li>
<li> It gets the job done without spending a lot of money, but it&#x27;s hard on the hands.  </li>
<li> I crush somewhat hard pills almost every day.  </li>
<li> I need to crush pills to mix in my cat&#x27;s food, and the pills are coated with a hard material.  </li>
<li> I have arthritis in my hands, and it is difficult for me to use the type that requires turning or twisting.  </li>
<li> I break-up around 20 a day for my husband and I have arthritis in my hands, so it is sometimes difficult for me to hold onto some objects.</li>
<li> It couldn&#x27;t be bad, and be stolen...</li>
<li> CRAP</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My husband has a feeding tube and has to have his pills pulverized.  The hand held crusher is not very good for this purpose.  It crushes but not enough for his needs.</li>
    <li> This item worked pretty good - left some larger chunks but much better than the twisting plastic ones that leave pieces of blue plastic in the medicine. It was reasonably priced but I was surprised when it actually broke. It seemed heavy duty - but I don&#x27;t think crushing 2 pills twice a day is excessive wear and tear. If you need a short term item, this may work for you. If you need something that will last, keep looking.</li>
    <li> I like the sturdy, thick metal construction of this unit, but it doesn&#x27;t do a good job crushing pills in the sense of crushing them into a powder.

    <li> This doesn&#x27;t work so well as a pill crusher.  It depends on the type of pill you want to crush.  The cheaper 6 dollar ergo Grip Crushers work much better</li>
    <li> The pharmacy sold crushers leave me with the funny feeling that some of the plastic spikes that crush might desintegrate over time, adding unwanted plastic particles in the crushed pill. I use this crusher and finish with a small pestle that I bought in Amazon.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was struggling with the cheap plastic pill grinder bought from a local drug store. I did some searching, found this on Amazon and bought it. I have to say it works great!!! I am very pleased. It is very sturdy and I think it will last practically forever.</li>
    <li> After a year the top handle started splitting from the bowl.  I crush somewhat hard pills almost every day.  Too much torque.  Maybe I just too strong.  Strong like bull.  Anyway, just know that this can happen.</li>
    <li> I use this at work every single day ! This product is a lifesaver! We have one big pill crusher on my unit and all the nurses are constantly looking for it and fighting over it; with this I save a lot of time and it really works ! I can keep the med In its original packaging and crush it or put it in pill crusher plastic sleeve packet and crush it. Therefor not cross contaminating it with other meds for other patients.</li>
    <li> I have alot of pills that i have to crush for my mother. I was using a crab hammer to smash the pills, and needless to say the whole family is grateful i found the perfect pill crusher.</li>
    <li> This is the best pill crusher I have found.  I have arthritis in my hands, and it is difficult for me to use the type that requires turning or twisting.  I need to crush pills to mix in my cat&#x27;s food, and the pills are coated with a hard material.  The coating makes them slippery, and they slide around in plastic pill crushers.  This crusher works very well.  It crushes the pill into tiny particles.  I follow-up with a mortar and pestle to get a finely-ground finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only been using this for a few days, so I can&#x27;t comment on how sturdy it may be except to say that it *seems* very strong.  It is heavy and made of metal, not the type of plastic that often breaks easily.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t crush pills to powder. Chunks too big to go down G tube. I&#x27;ve said all I want to. CRAP</li>
    <li> It good and sturdy item, very useful for people who do not want to swallow big pills, I would certainly recommend others to buy it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, my mother in law use it like 10 times a day, worth the price.</li>
    <li> Really sturdy little pill crusher on small to medium size pills, but being a bit feeble in my older age, it is difficult for me to crush large pills.  That&#x27;s okay though....makes for great wrist and forearm muscles exercise!</li>
    <li> Works as advertised, easy to use,</li>
    <li> It gets the job done without spending a lot of money, but it&#x27;s hard on the hands.  It is less messy than the twist cup type.</li>
    <li> that pill crusher is no good,I dont like it.</li>
    <li> Product arrived in a timely manner and in good shape. If you crush one end and turn pill around and crush the other way this is a great unit and well made. Best on the market I have seen</li>
    <li> I  am a woman in my late seventies, somewhat frail,  and not always in the best of health.  For years I&#x27;ve struggled with battery-operated, screw-type and other pill crushers always being reduced to using a regular hammer which requires wrapping the pill in cloth or plastic and noisily hammering away.&lt;br /&gt;This hand-held crusher has eliminated all the bother. I can use it easily, it crushes the biggest and hardest pills and it stores easily.  I recommend it unqualifiedly. It&#x27;s been the answer to my wishes.</li>
    <li> We were crushing pills using a hammer.  Not the best.  This sturdy tool worked just as promised.  You do need a good supply of tiny zipper bags, as they are ruined with each use, but they are inexpensive and keep all the contents contained.  Takes a certain amount of hand strength, but not excessive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a nurse in a hospital.  This crusher worked well, but started to bend after a while, and like the other reviewer said, the handle would have eventually split from the bowl.  It seems like this would have been a bad review, but the fact remains that this was the best pill crusher I&#x27;ve ever used.  I could crush medications in their packets rather than having to take them out each time.  It is pretty sturdy as long as you don&#x27;t put tons of torque into it.  This crusher saved me a lot of time from using the twist crushers.  Be aware that if you need very fine powder (like for a flexiflo tube) then you may have to use a twist-type.... this one gets it fine, but not always super-fine.  All-in-all... the crusher must be pretty good, because someone stole it... and I had my name on it in permanent marker (unable to be removed permanent, because I tried to clean it off myself) and someone still walked off with it.  It couldn&#x27;t be bad, and be stolen...</li>
    <li> very good pill crusher for the price. I break-up around 20 a day for my husband and I have arthritis in my hands, so it is sometimes difficult for me to hold onto some objects. And with little strength in my hands I can only squeeze so much and have to do one or two pills at a time. The plastic bags are first off impractical for me as you can only do so many pills in a bag&lt;br /&gt;AND then the pill pieces tear the bags and you can lose lots of product trying to get the bags open and emptied. The crushing surfaces do get tacky with pill residue but a little warm water and air dry gets everything ready for the next go-round. I much appreciate this product.</li>
