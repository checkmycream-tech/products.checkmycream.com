<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s uncomfortable no matter how the elastic band is adjusted. It does not block out all of the light around the lower part of the mask.  Do not waste your money on this mask; I wish I hadn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> At first, not too bad, blocked out all extra light. After a while, though, I discovered it was too tight around the eyes. If I loosened it, it was too loose to stay on and didn&#x27;t block out light. Kept waking up with headaches because it was so tight. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone, especially anyone with sensitive eyes.</li>
    <li> Nicely made and comfortable. Shipped on time and packaging was good. Thank you.</li>
    <li> The seller is very nice. Shipping is faster than my expected time. I want to have a sleep mask for a long time because I like having a nap in my yard under the sunshine and in the fresh air. Wearing a sleep mask is very comfortable. This product blocks the dazzling sunshine for me. It is comfortable and portable.</li>
    <li> I ordered several different eye masks and I like this one best, it is really perfect.  Feels lovely on skin, and does the job of keeping light out.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried m,y sleep masks, but this one is by Far the best. It is wide enough so little to no light gets through.  It is soft silk so feels cool on your face. The elastic strap is thin enough yet secure and adjustable! It doesn&#x27;t slide once you adjust. So far, this is the best one I have tried. I just re-ordered 2 more, one as a gift and a back-up for myself. Thanks for designing a well made mask!</li>
    <li> Soft,comfortable. But covers half my face.</li>
    <li> I liked the silky material and it was very comfortable and helpful in the past couple nights when I had it on. Great product to have for a good night sleep!</li>
    <li> Great mask! So soft :)</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the Eminer Sleep Eye Mask.  It is comfortable and helps me get much-needed rest.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I decided to buy this eye mask because its rating seems to be better than other popular ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s soft and comfortable, but unfortunately light enters from space around my nose. I am a little disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time I buy a eye mask, so I cannot tell if there are better ones though.</li>
    <li> No cupping so pressure is put on the eyes but it beats a bandana</li>
    <li> Works good.  Fits my small head!</li>
    <li> Good quality material. Keeps out the light. It&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
    <li> As with others who have purchased this eye mask, I am unable to sleep with any source of light in the house, coming around the black-out shade - you name it.  It&#x27;s like a curse and my daughter has it too, so I&#x27;m blaming it on genes.  That said, I&#x27;ve owned many eye masks over the years and have had to cut into each one of them to accommodate my somewhat highly arched nose, cut the elastic in half and add a large safety pin: I&#x27;ve always looked ridiculous and slightly uncomfortable in whatever my current version happened to be.  One of the bad things about ALL of them has been is that I also have slightly protruding eyes, so every morning I had what I call cornea recovery time, because the pressure from the eye cover, which was not great, but enough to ever so slightly deform my corneas, affected my vision for a short while after risiing.  All of the aforementioned is no longer an issue, as the Eminer Eye Mask is incredibly soft and large enough to take care of the face issues of which I spoke.  And, I no longer have to cut the elastic in half to add a large safety pin, because this one comes with a wider elastic band and an adjuster on it.  Yay!  is what I have to say about this eye mask.  I could not be happier and plan to purchase another for travel and would give it 6 stars if I could.</li>
    <li> Comfortable, easily adjustable straps.  Good light blockage.</li>
    <li> I have been using for a month or so now and it works very well.  I use it to block out the morning light, which otherwise wakes me.  The product is very comfortable, so much so I am usually surprised to find it in place when I wake - it goes unnoticed and stays in place quite well.  Obviously, this is not the most complicated product - but I would say this is a very good product at what it does.  I should note - that as of the time I ordered my product in May 2015, the logo has been removed to make it easier to reverse.  I have tried it reversed and it works just as well.  The Company also followed up with an email - so I would expect good customer support - although it is hard to envision needing support.  I would describe this as a premium version - much better than the ones airlines pass out.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really soft and completely blocks out the light.</li>
    <li> very comfy and keeps the light out</li>
    <li> Works perfect! Adjustable fit and snug in the back. Blocks out a ton of light. There is a little gap by the nose where light does come through, but you only notice it if your eyes are open. If you work nights and sleep during the day, this is a must have! Very pleased with this product and the seller!</li>
    <li> Most comfortable eye mask I&#x27;ve tried! Does not irritate my skin or eyelids. It is &amp;#34;slippery&amp;#34; but I put the band low as suggested with the packaging.</li>
    <li> Received the mask. Soft and comfortable as advertised.  Blocks out the sunlight.</li>
    <li> I love this mask and here&#x27;s why. First and foremost is that there is no velcro. There are so many quality eye masks on the market, but many have velcro straps which pretty much destroy your hair at night. Like, literally tears your hair strands in two. This eye mask has no velcro but is still adjustable. It&#x27;s a thin, light strap, but the metal adjuster-thingy is small enough that it doesn&#x27;t hurt your head (for back-sleepers), and it&#x27;s nice and secure so the strap doesn&#x27;t loosen with use. The material is soft over the eyes. It&#x27;s just an all around quality eye mask with just the perfect details for extended, daily use. I hope this will be available for the rest of my life!</li>
    <li> what I thought it was</li>
    <li> This was not at all what I had hoped for. The photo is deceptive because I thought there was some cushion (like a pillow), like some other sleep masks I have tried. This was just flat silky material and it did NOT block out light. I am returning it, and will try another one.</li>
    <li> Nice soft sleep mask. Material is nice to the touch and feels good over the eyes. This is comfortable and does its job of keeping out the light. Sample received in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> I work an overnight hospital graveyard shift and have difficulty with daytime sleeping.  I have used various sleep mask and many are bothersome to me.  My new Eminer sleepmask is silk and lightweight so I find it less cumbersomeness than most others.  The delivery was fast and the company even contacted me twice to assure I was happy with their product.  I definitely recommend this mask and the Eminer company,</li>
    <li> Great and comfortable</li>
    <li> Really soft and comfortable sleep mask.  You have to spend a little time adjusting it to the contours of your face but after that, you hardly know it&#x27;s on.  The carrying pouch is a plus because I can find it easily in my drawer.  This will be perfect for traveling as well.  And the little all purpose tool in the box was a great find.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have difficulty to sleep,especially at daytime,it very hard to sleep well,my daughter bought this for me,it really works well,when i put on my eye,i feel like night,it&#x27;s quite soft,feel very relax wear it,i&#x27;m very happy and thanks for it help me to improve my sleep,now i can have nap very easy and feel great. Thanks eminer. The shop also contact me for two times to confirm i got product and if it&#x27;s work well. Hope you guys want to have good sleep can find it and helps you.</li>
    <li> I always roll over when i sleep at night,but when i wake up,the sleep mask still keeps very well,i just adjust the strap to fit my head,it will stay stable and comfortable,i can have deep sleep with the sleep mask no matter at night or at weekend morning,it&#x27;s a good product!</li>
    <li> Great product with good quality. I like it! Will recommend it to my friends!</li>
    <li> Bought it to use for a upcoming trip. This is the best eye mask I&#x27;ve ever had. The silk gives a super soft feeling. It also comes with a nice little travel bag, which is useful to prevent the delicate material from scratches. Definitely worth the price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of masks and shades over years of travel, including the ones given out by various airlines. This one by Eminer is one of the best.&lt;br /&gt;100% silk. All black. Very good coverage all around the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Completely opaque, no light shows through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At 1/2 an ounce, it&#x27;s practically weightless. Completely soft to the touch, if you&#x27;re sensitive to that kind of thing. Reversible, if you don&#x27;t mind the Eminer logo next to your eyelid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Washable. Comes with its own waterproof travel pouch. (Of course, any Ziplock sandwich bag will do)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eminer sent a sample for testing and impartial review. Overall it&#x27;s a very good mask, and I like it.&lt;br /&gt;Just one thing I suggest that Eminer change: like another reviewer, I&#x27;d rather not have the large printed logo, and I&#x27;d like it better if they just left the logo off of future production runs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review is helpful as you comparison shop eyeshades/sleep masks. Happy travels, everybody.</li>
    <li> This is very soft and comfortable to sleep in.  Just what I needed!</li>
    <li> Been using it for a while now and work great block most light out and after a while U get use to using it then it&#x27;s hard to sleep with out it.</li>
    <li> This sleep mask is comfortable and does an excellent job of blocking light.  I have a hard time sleeping if there is even the light of an alarm clock nearby, so this is perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask is 100% pure silk, and the elastic band is surprisingly comfortable.  I have long hair, and it did not get snarled by the band material.</li>
    <li> Love it! The mask is so lightweight, you almost don&#x27;t know you have it on. Completely blocks out the light, even in the bright morning light. It fits snugly due to the adjustable strap and is very comfortable on my face. Love, love, LOVE it!</li>
    <li> I feel relaxed when i wake up the next day.</li>
    <li> the best such mask I have ever used.  I spend a lot of time on flights of 6-18 hours and find this mask is incredibly comfortable and easy to adjust to fit my face.  I&#x27;ll never use another type of mask again.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t know it was daytime good fit.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s what I got from this after just the first night. My bedroom window (All of them here) faces INTO the rising sun-- who designed this place?? I&#x27;d practically have to board up the windows to cut out most of the light that sneaks in thru &amp; round the curtains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Silky smooth, cool, not hot cloth which I&#x27;ve suffered through before with sleep masks I&#x27;ve tried. The adjustable band is anchored Tightly, there are some other brands of cheap sleep mask where I&#x27;ve run through countless copies because the bands snap and pulls out from the mask itself -- or they stretch out of all proportion and the mask become useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a Fine One: Best I&#x27;ve come across so far and reasonably priced for that quality, durability. With my earplugs in I simply can&#x27;t be disturbed. Sweet Dreams :)</li>
    <li> This sleep mask is perfect. It blocks all light and fits my head well. Did not slide off or feel uncomfortable like a lot of sleep masks on the market. Also it is adjustable if you have a smaller head. I bought this because of all the 5 star reviews for this product and I am glad I did. Now this is the only sleep mask I am going to use for the rest of my life. Thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> They will do, but touch my eye lashes, which I find annoying.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Need a sleep mask to help get to sleep and stay asleep as I use a CPAP machine.  This mask is soft and comfortable, one of the best on the market and the silk is so soft and easy to wash.</li>
    <li> Straps don&#x27;t stay snug enough, but otherwise my college student loves it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good mask, keeps the light out.  Stays on while sleeping.</li>
    <li> Just what I was hoping for!  Very comfortable to wear. Greatly promotes good sleep.</li>
    <li> I suffer with insomnia and I am lucky if I am able to get 3 hours of sleep a night, and every little thing distracts me so I&#x27;ve switched to using sleep masks. Most sleep masks end up annoying me or hurting my head so I rip them off before I even fall asleep. The Eminer Ultra Soft Sleep Mask is one of the only masks I&#x27;ve tried that I am able to wear comfortably throughout the night with no problems.&lt;br /&gt;What are the features?&lt;br /&gt;·  Made of pure silk making it very soft and comfortable on the eyes&lt;br /&gt;·  The mask itself is very light and hardly felt on the face at night&lt;br /&gt;·  100% money back guarantee&lt;br /&gt;This sleep mask by Eminer is extremely comfortable to wear and it completely blocks out all traces of light. Since I suffer with extreme insomnia I often take naps during the day time when I can, and this sleep mask even blocks out the full light of the day so I can sleep soundly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy the fact that this mask is fully adjustable so it’s not too tight on my head giving me a headache, and the mask also doesn&#x27;t fall off of my face when I’m tossing and turning in the night. The silk feels very luxurious on my eyes, I actually find  that it’s very soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The adjustable strap on the back of this mask is great. It’s made of elastic so it stretches but you can also adjust it to be your perfect size. I have long hair and it doesn’t get caught up in this strap so overall this mask is a real winner in my book!&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a luxurious feeling sleep mask at a great price you need this one by Eminer. I received this product for evaluation, but these are my own opinions.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter. The feature that made me buy this one instead of any other mask is that the adjustable band on this mask doe NOT have velcro.  May daughter found that her hair would get tangled in the velcro &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; with the other masks she tried.  She said this mask is very comfortable and stays in place well.</li>
    <li> I just received this eye mask and was surprised at how soft it is!  Traveling is often not a fun experience, but when you have a great eye mask it makes everything a  lot better!  This eye mask blocks out the light and is super light weight.  It also comes with a bag that you can put it in so it will stay clean.  The adjustable strap works great, and was a huge plus for me because I have a large head :)  Also, the strap is thin enough so if you want to rest your head the strap won&#x27;t cause pain by pressing in.  Some reviews mentioned that they did not like the large logo, well Eminer removed the logo off of their new design.  Great product!  Would recommend getting one for sure.  Traveling is exhausting but with this eye mask I might actually look forward to my next flight!</li>
    <li> Very nice.  Soft and no light gets thru.  Very helpful trying to get to sleep!</li>
