      <li>I&#x27;m new to Burt&#x27;s Bees, so I thought this would be a good starter kit</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s become a quick favorite.</li>
      <li>Well, I wasn&#x27;t impressed with them because they were a little oily and smelled a bit like Vick&#x27;s Vapor rub.  </li>
      <li>I love it very much.</li>
      <li>Naturally Nourishing Milk &amp; Honey Body Lotion - this is the one that I like the most!   </li>
      <li>the scent is okay, but it doesn&#x27;t, imho, clean very well.</li>
      <li>Perfect size to say the least.  </li>
      <li>and I have since purchased the full size face wash and body lotion.</li>
      <li>It is a good &amp; economy way to try out BB different items before buying the full size ones, and I want to use them after my gym sessions.  </li>
      <li>I bought this kit before spending full price on the big bottles and I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
      <li>Fabulously Fresh Peppermint &amp; Rosemary Body</li>
      <li>What I expected will be a perfect gift just a tad smaller</li>
      <li>its much more smaller than it looks; and for the price it just dont made it worth.</li>
      <li>The shipping was very fast.</li>
      <li>Love the deep cleanser and body wash!</li>
      <li>If you are the type of person who likes to try products out before you buy the actual size then you will love this too.</li>
      <li>So it was pretty beat up in the process</li>
      <li>Nicely packaged and I love the quality of the Burts Bees products, but this was smaller than I had expected.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The results were more mixed than I had thought they would be.</li>
      <li>The web-site would not allow me to complete the order and get the \\&quot;Free Shipping\\&quot; that they advertised.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>, I will be buying the real sizes once these are all gone.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Burts Bee&#x27;s!</li>
      <li>Also contains four other nice sized samplings of other products like the milk and honey lotion, the lip balm and a body wash, which I also enjoyed.</li>
      <li>I believe she will really like the chance to try some your products.</li>
      <li>Really,</li>
      <li>My niece absolutely LOVES the stuff, so I gave it all to her.  </li>
      <li>She absolutely loves all the products in it.  </li>
      <li>She feels very grown up with them</li>
      <li>Although, I later found out this is available at target, too.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t use their products before that really</li>
      <li>but it is nice just small</li>
      <li>I like the mini versions or travel pack, they&#x27;re cute and portable and you get to try a little bit of everything.</li>
      <li>I expected to *love* the Peppermint &amp; Rosemary Body Wash, and that was my least favorite item in the pack --</li>
      <li>I have use Burts Bees for years, but recently made a large on-line purchase, directly from the Burts Bees (not through Amazon).  </li>
      <li>Overall, most of my guesses would have been wrong, and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t shell out big bucks and instead used a trial pack like this one.</li>
      <li>surprised lip balm.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The product is very good. I love it very much.</li>
    <li> Bought it for a friend.  She seemed most pleased to have it for her upcoming HotShot crew work&lt;br /&gt;Really?  Really,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to Burt&#x27;s Bees, so I thought this would be a good starter kit and it was. The coconut foot cream is ok, the hand solve is AMAZING! The face wash left a weird residue on my face that I didn&#x27;t like, the body wash only smelled like peppermint but it foamed nicely. Lip balm is lip balm, and the lotion was good.&lt;br /&gt; Overall I feel like this was a good value for my money to try before I buy full size.</li>
    <li> Perfect Burt&#x27;s Bees product and makes for very easy travel sizes.  Perfect size to say the least.  Would buy another one!</li>
    <li> It is a good &amp; economy way to try out BB different items before buying the full size ones, and I want to use them after my gym sessions.  Naturally Nourishing Milk &amp; Honey Body Lotion - this is the one that I like the most!   Fabulously Fresh Peppermint &amp; Rosemary Body Wash - great smell &amp; does the job!  Hand Salve - it&#x27;s okay, i just don&#x27;t like the container.  Soap Bark &amp; Chamomile Deep Cleansing Crème - it&#x27;s great one too!  Coconut Foot Crème - it&#x27;s only one i dislike the oily feel texture...  full-size Beeswax Lip Balm - not surprised lip balm.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied.   Waited hours to buy this product.   I recommend getting this product, too.   Two Burt &#x27;s set to use only the best is full of items.   If you like, it would be nice to somebody.</li>
    <li> What I expected will be a perfect gift just a tad smaller then I thought it would be but still good.</li>
    <li> I purchased this trial pack so that I could try some of Burt&#x27;s Bees other products, as my husband and myself are addicted to Burt&#x27;s Chapstick.  So far, so great!  I really enjoy the smell of the body wash, the milk and honey lotion is amazing, my skin feels moisturized and smooth, and the foot cream and hand salve are awesome!  I would recommend this for a travel kit or for someone looking to try out Burt&#x27;s amazing products!</li>
    <li> Nicely packaged and I love the quality of the Burts Bees products, but this was smaller than I had expected.</li>
    <li> As I received the item, I found it was so small. Not quality the price, so I do not recommend to buy it.</li>
    <li> I got this for my mom for her birthday.  She loves it, and uses it all the time. The shipping was very fast. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I ordered this gife as a secret santa present. It came in the mail just days before the party and the box was completly distroyed. It was packed in a shipping box but it was the products box that was torn up. I had to take everything out and re-wrap it. I love Burts Bees but it made it very hard to give it as a gift.</li>
    <li> its much more smaller than it looks; and for the price it just dont made it worth. try the bigger size options.</li>
    <li> Part of a Christmas gift for my daughter.  She absolutely loves all the products in it.  She feels very grown up with them and since they are more natural we feel good about her having them.</li>
    <li> I purchased this sample set to try out Burt&#x27;s Bees products.  It was a good value for the money and I will purchase regular sizes of at least half of these items.</li>
    <li> Cute everything wasn&#x27;t opened ( I had to check). For my sisters birthday as it&#x27;s bumble bee themed. It came in those mailing bags tho. So it was pretty beat up in the process</li>
    <li> I got this for my grandmother and she loved it! I love burt&#x27;s bees products, and this is a great assortment for a great price. Although, I later found out this is available at target, too. And target matches Amazon&#x27;s prices!</li>
    <li> It is deff littler then i expected. I will deff have to get another gift to go with it but it is nice just small</li>
    <li> This was a gift to my Granddaughter for Christmas. But it was on her wish list, as she loves everything by Burts Bees.</li>
    <li> Received one of these as a Christmas Gift. Didn&#x27;t use their products before that really but this one won me over. I loved most of what&#x27;s in this set. My favorite being the hand salve and the coconut foot scrub. Both had a great smell and worked well. Also contains four other nice sized samplings of other products like the milk and honey lotion, the lip balm and a body wash, which I also enjoyed. I like the mini versions or travel pack, they&#x27;re cute and portable and you get to try a little bit of everything. The person who got it for me turned me onto them and I bought some sets for some other people. This would be a good gift for someone who hasn&#x27;t tried it before. This has something in it for everyone. Also is natural/organic.</li>
    <li> BEWARE:  I have use Burts Bees for years, but recently made a large on-line purchase, directly from the Burts Bees (not through Amazon).  The web-site would not allow me to complete the order and get the \\&quot;Free Shipping\\&quot; that they advertised.  So, thinking  that maybe they would \\&quot;catch and correct it\\&quot; as I choose the payment: I pressed submit.  It did not correct and charged me shipping.  I immediately sent an e-mail asking that the company credit the shipping or cancel the order.  They sent a generic form e-mail stating someone would contact me withing 48 hours.  Six days later and  nothing had happened, I sent another e-mails stating the same thing and received the generic notice, but once again, no one called and the shipping was not credited.  Then  I got the notice the items had shipped.  I called the company and talked to Gabriel who said she could not do anything about it, but would have her boss, Jess, contact me within 24 hours.  No one did.  I am currently on hold with the company again.</li>
    <li> Item arrived on the earliest estimated delivery date. However, there is a gaping void where the foot cream should be. There is no way someone could pack this, without noticing, the kit was incomplete.  Too close to Christmas to fix (11 days). So I&#x27;ll be going back to the stores, to find something to replace it.</li>
    <li> I bought this kit before spending full price on the big bottles and I&#x27;m glad I did! All the products were great and I have since purchased the full size face wash and body lotion.</li>
    <li> I ordered this from Burt&#x27;s Bees. This product is attractive in the pactage advertised. the package you get is not atall the same its a cheap nockoff looking generice CRAP. the products are there but if it you want it to look nice find it elseware.</li>
    <li> great way to preview product to see if you like it --- I love this product and now use the shampoo and foot moisturizer all the time.  Love that is is safe for me and the environment too.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for a friend. I believe she will really like the chance to try some your products. It makes a great gift because it gives someone the opportunity to try a range of products.</li>
    <li> This is not the pack that comes with the body wash as shown... But I&#x27;m keeping it anyway.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve wanted to try Burt&#x27;s Bees for some time, but the prices for full-size products are a bit hefty, and what if I didn&#x27;t like it? Money waster, so I never did, but this sampler gave me a great opportunity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results were more mixed than I had thought they would be. I expected to *love* the Peppermint &amp; Rosemary Body Wash, and that was my least favorite item in the pack -- the scent is okay, but it doesn&#x27;t, imho, clean very well. I had no real expectations for the lip balm but it&#x27;s become a quick favorite. And the Milk &amp; Honey Body Lotion was just as terrific as I&#x27;d thought it would be. Overall, most of my guesses would have been wrong, and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t shell out big bucks and instead used a trial pack like this one.</li>
    <li> I liked this a lot it was very nice and such. I liked that i could sample everything in one package</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift and it was perfect!</li>
    <li> This was a great way to try out new Burt&#x27;s Bees products without wasting money. Love the deep cleanser and body wash! The hand salve, not so good.</li>
    <li> I was anxious to try Burt&#x27;s Bees products because I heard they were the cat&#x27;s meow.  Well, I wasn&#x27;t impressed with them because they were a little oily and smelled a bit like Vick&#x27;s Vapor rub.  However, not all was lost.  My niece absolutely LOVES the stuff, so I gave it all to her.  She is totally happy so for that, I rate you a 5! It arrived in a perfect amount of time and the packaging was awesome.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I am absolutely in love with this kit! It comes in such a perfect package. If you are the type of person who likes to try products out before you buy the actual size then you will love this too. I&#x27;m very happy to say that I tried almost everything out tonight and I like everything that I tried, I will be buying the real sizes once these are all gone.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Burts Bee&#x27;s!</li>
