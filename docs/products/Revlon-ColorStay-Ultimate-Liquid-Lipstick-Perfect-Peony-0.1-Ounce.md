<li> This product is long lasting and does not dry out my lips.....</li>
<li> It is a one process application, not two, like some long lasting types</li>
<li> Only downside that I find, is that there is not much product in the tube.  </li>
<li> All day long, through 2 meals it stays on!  </li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t dry our your lips and it does stay on.</li>
<li> It is getting harder to find in the stores</li>
<li> Was really not</li>
<li> The lipstick wears all day without touch ups but can dry a little so you may want a lip balm.</li>
<li> I love this lipstick but when I got my last order, this was an old thick and gooey lipstick~very disappointed!</li>
<li> seems to be a little cakey</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not available in the stores anymore.  </li>
<li> Just dab on a little vaseline - it will feel like all you have on your lips is the vaseline!  </li>
<li> I ordered two and only rec&#x27;d one :-(&lt;br</li>
<li> I was not happy with the Peach lipstick though.</li>

    <li> I have this liquid lipstick in many colors and love its staying power.  All day long, through 2 meals it stays on!  Your lips will feel dry if you don&#x27;t put anything on top of it.  Just dab on a little vaseline - it will feel like all you have on your lips is the vaseline!  And underneath, the color still stays on.</li>
    <li> My friend has looked for this particular color for months.  It&#x27;s not available in the stores anymore.  When I gave her several tubes, she was ecstatic.  I can always depend on Amazon.com to carry hard-to-find items at a fair price.</li>
    <li> I love the revlon lip stains, they&#x27;re the best &amp; last all day long!</li>
    <li> Favorite color and great liquid lipstick.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Great service.</li>
    <li> This lipstick literally stays on ALL day when I apply it in the morning. Sometimes it stays until the next day. Will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> Use it everyday, great lip color that last all day! I also use Cover Girl Outlast lip color. Both are great products I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have only put it on to see if I like the color...I haven&#x27;t put it on for the entire day so I couldn&#x27;t answer that questions, therefore it got 4*</li>
    <li> Once in a while a product lives up to it&#x27;s hype. This one does. It doesn&#x27;t dry our your lips and it does stay on.</li>
    <li> It stays on all day, but leaves a kind of cakey residue that&#x27;s hard to remove with just soap and water.</li>

    <li> I have been using this lipstick for years but could not find this  shade in stores.  Happy to find. It on Amazon.  Lipstick stays on all day and does not come off on cups or anything else.  It is a one process application, not two, like some long lasting types</li>
