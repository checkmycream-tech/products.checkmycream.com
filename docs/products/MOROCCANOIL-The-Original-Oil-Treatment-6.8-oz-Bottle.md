      <li>I agree with a lot of reveiwes when they say that the regular argan oil just sits on top of your hair but the morrocan oil really absorbed into my hair without it leaving it weighed down</li>

    <li> Excellent oil. Gives a lot of shine to your hair and helps with tangling</li>
    <li> My hair gets colored, highlighted and lots of sun leading to dryness and a lackluster look. Moroccan Oil Treatment has brought back a healthy and shiny luster to my hair. I love this product and won&#x27;t go without it. I ordered the jumbo size of the oil treatment, hydrating shampoo and conditioner. I recommend it without reservations. Try It and you will love it!

    <li> I use this product exclusively. I have long thick hair and this product works.  I use to have to wash my hair every day but now I can skip a day or two and my hair looks just as good as the day I washed it.  Highly recommend!!!!!</li>
    <li> I am a AA/AI/W female and am on a hair journey to grow my hair out from the perms.  I use this after the Moroccanoil shampoo and conditioner and I just cannot say enough about this and all of my Moroccanoil products.  They cost a bit more than other hair care products, but these are completely worth every cent.</li>

    <li> I use this product when I straighten my hair. I have very curly hair. When I used to straighten imy hai it always looked dry and on hot days it would get frizzy.

    <li> I was not so pleased to find an oily package at my doorstep. The shipper could have taken the time to ensure that the item was not in the opened position and done more to protect the item, 1/3 of the oil had leaked.
