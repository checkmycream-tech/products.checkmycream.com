      <li>This thing works great!</li>

      <li>I gave this a 3 because even though it hasn&#x27;t whitened it does provide great moisture to my lips.</li>
      <li>Good quality packaging.  </li>
      <li>Good lip balm but does not do what it says.</li>
      <li>The fruit balm smells great and has a nice orange-reddish tint to it (see picture).</li>
      <li>and it does nothing not even a good lip balm</li>
      <li>There is a lot of it, so that&#x27;s good.  </li>

      <li>This product is sooo amazing</li>
      <li>The tube is a nice size, which lasts quite a while.  </li>
      <li>i feel it nice on lips</li>
      <li>Use it every night nice moisture</li>
      <li>Firstly, I have to say that I didn&#x27;t find this product to do a very good job at whitening the discoloration from my lips.</li>
      <li>but the color is perfectly look natural with my tan skin.</li>
      <li>It does provide excellent moisturization to the lips and makes your lips supple and soft.</li>
      <li>This one does not moisturise, in fact, it sits on top of the lips and does not sink in at all.</li>
      <li>then I use this one during the day time, and I love it.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I used it for over 6 months, since it is ayurvedic I gave it more time.  </li>
      <li>now I have to find another product and spend more money...</li>
      <li>It gives a light beautiful color and smoothens lips very well.</li>
      <li>and it tasted pretty good though.</li>
      <li>The cream itself is good quality, smells nice, has a good consistency, is colored dark orange.</li>
      <li>but when i applied it on my lips it was a really pretty color!!</li>
      <li>Well after using this, I can happily say I can wear pink and peach shades again.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff so much that I&#x27;ve been wearing it literally around the clock.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping!!  </li>
      <li>Very effective when compared to other chapsticks and also suits people with darker complexion!</li>
      <li>This product is very moisturizing and makes my lips feel velvety smooth.</li>
      <li>but they refused to refund me because it was out for shipment but whatever it was worth testing it out (I guess).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a smoker and my lips have been darkening to the point where my paler shades of lipstick were becoming pointless to own.</li>
      <li>I find it to be pretty.</li>
      <li>If I had only seen even a little bit of lightening it would have been great.  </li>
      <li>really see a difference for my lips but</li>
      <li>products does not seem to work fast.</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s very moisturizing to the lips.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t used it very often so I dont know if it works</li>
      <li>It really works.</li>
      <li>I have not yet seen any real difference in my lip color, but it is very moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>It works very well</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s not glossy and very drying to lips</li>
      <li>Instead of making my lips lighter, it darkened my lips &amp; i have pretty sensitive lips</li>
      <li>did go ahead and order a second bottle recently, but for some reason, it seems the formula has been changed and not for the better.</li>
      <li>Another issue that I had was that it interfered with the colour of my lips products, although being brown, the first one did not, and because the texture was such that it sank into the lips, application of other products on top of it, wasn&#x27;t an issue.</li>

      <li>First, the new one was a completely different colour, the old one was a brown that was slightly red, the new one is cherry red and it smells much more fruity than the first.</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t be repurchasing this, on the off chance that the new formula is here to stay.</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t be repurchasing this, on the off chance that the new formula is here to stay.</li>
      <li>The new one, because it sits on top like oil and is an obvious red, mixed in with, and changed the colours of all my lipsticks and glosses.</li>
      <li>The new one, because it sits on top like oil and is an obvious red, mixed in with, and changed the colours of all my lipsticks and glosses.</li>
      <li>That is not a problem, as I have a great lip moisturizer already, however I was really hoping to lighten (with natural ingredients)around my upper lip which has become darker over the past few years.  </li>
      <li>It is not a moisturizer, which is stated directly on the directions.  </li>
      <li>It can still be used as lip balm but as far as whitening goes it just don&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>The product does work but you have to apply it several times a day and gently exfoliate your lips at night to see the results.</li>
      <li>but Biotique makes them feel heavenly and soft and works well overnight and under lipstick.  </li>
      <li>This stuff works really well, and I&#x27;m about to purchase my second bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The lip balm is a reddish brown color, which can add a nice tint to your lips, however that is not to be confused with lightening.  </li>
      <li>Also, where my first bottle functioned in the way it was designed, it also doubled very well as a moisturising lip balm, that I could wear alone for just a very slight hint of natural looking colour.</li>
      <li>Maybe I have to use it a little longer, but it doesn&#x27;t even really keep my lips moisturizer like other lip balms, because It easily comes off.</li>
      <li>and my lips are super dark from yeeeears of smoking !</li>
      <li>i guess you would need to use it everyday for a few months to get amazing results</li>
      <li>I do however think that this is for people with very highly pigmented lips, I think if your lips are only slightly darkened you won&#x27;t see much of a difference.</li>
      <li>The smell took a bit to get used to since I&#x27;m not a fan of scents anywhere near my face and especially not on my lips, but I got used to it and got over it.</li>
      <li>In fact it did the complete opposite.</li>

<li> I noticed a slight lightness on my dark lips and has not stopped since the first application.</li>
<li> I usually would use a soft wash cloth to gently scrub off the dead skin</li>
<li> i think it helps on long run..</li>
<li> Complete waste of money.</li>
<li> What it did do was make them extremely dry to the point of cracking</li>
<li> Was a total waste - haven used it constantly for over 2 weeks it just have me dry lips</li>
<li> maybe because I only use it at night or because my lips are  dark.</li>
<li> &amp; I&#x27;m not normally bothered by that</li>
<li> a dark female</li>
<li> I have over a half a container left.  </li>
<li> My lips are very dry</li>
<li> Has a lot in it so it should last quite a few months.</li>
<li> anyhow I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again, The tube does have alot on it though if I were to use it everyday it would proboly last me 3-5months.</li>
<li> The thing I like about it is that it is plant-based so no real danger of chemical reactions.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this since late August, early September and within a few days, I&#x27;d noticed a definite difference.</li>
<li> Really sad, since the old one worked so well and lasted such a long time.</li>
<li> Really sad, since the old one worked so well and lasted such a long time.rwards, rehabbing my dried out lips.</li>
<li> , it didn&#x27;t lighten them, it basically gave my lips a very painful sunburn without the sun, this after only using it for two or three days because I&#x27;d quickly realised the effect it was having on my lips when it literally started burning shortly after application.</li>
<li> It took a month for this to lighten a dark stain on my lip and still hasn&#x27;t lightened the darkness at the corners of my mouth.</li>
<li> My skin tone has lightened up over the years but my lips stayed dark.</li>
<li> The color is dark brown and stains rims of cups</li>
<li> The stain did not disappear but it seems to have turned slightly lighter.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t even waste ur money on this, it doesn&#x27;t do anything</li>
<li> Just a waste of money.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used this for a few weeks now, I haven&#x27;t noticed any results.</li>
<li> As it is it cannot hurt, but not sure if it will remove my stain.</li>
<li> This product is no more than a glossy lip balm.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because it came from india</li>

    <li> Just a waste of money.Good lip balm but does not do what it says.</li>
    <li> i think it helps on long run.. i feel it nice on lips</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t used it very often so I dont know if it works but the color is perfectly look natural with my tan skin.</li>
    <li> It really works. I love it. Began seeing a difference in one day. I guess it suits persons with a darker complexion. Has a lot in it so it should last quite a few months. Great product.</li>
    <li> This product is sooo amazing I&#x27;ve seen a change in my lip color drastically. I use it almost all day and I also sleep with it on. This morning I woke up and my lips we lighter and u can see where the product is working!! The only thing I&#x27;m unsure of is will my lips stay this color or will I have to contuie to use it for the rest of my life lol.</li>
    <li> Excellent as a lip moisturizer but didn&#x27;t notice any lightening effect</li>
    <li> My lip colour hasn&#x27;t changed in the slightest  :/ it&#x27;s been over 2 weeks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a few weeks now, I haven&#x27;t noticed any results. I gave this a 3 because even though it hasn&#x27;t whitened it does provide great moisture to my lips.</li>
    <li> The bottle it comes in is pretty big for being a lip balm, with that being said it should late for a while. I didnt think i was going to like it because the color of the lip balm is like a reddish brown color but when i applied it on my lips it was a really pretty color!! I have used it for about 3 days and i can totally see the difference! This thing works great!</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work after 6 months of using it, I see no change at all....now I have to find another product and spend more money... This product doesn&#x27;t lightened my lips at all...</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this did not work for me.  I used it for over 6 months, since it is ayurvedic I gave it more time.  The lip balm is a reddish brown color, which can add a nice tint to your lips, however that is not to be confused with lightening.  It is not a moisturizer, which is stated directly on the directions.  That is not a problem, as I have a great lip moisturizer already, however I was really hoping to lighten (with natural ingredients)around my upper lip which has become darker over the past few years.  The tube is a nice size, which lasts quite a while.  I have over a half a container left.  If I had only seen even a little bit of lightening it would have been great.  I&#x27;ve found an alternative on Amazon, which hopefully I will receive in a couple of days.</li>
    <li> yes this work . i do apply it ofter im a dark female and my lips are super dark from yeeeears of smoking ! i applied for about five days  i see a difference.</li>
    <li> This product is very moisturizing and makes my lips feel velvety smooth. I don&#x27;t know about the whitening part. But it&#x27;s very moisturizing to the lips.</li>
    <li> This product is no more than a glossy lip balm. I do not recommend this product. Complete waste of money.</li>

I do however think that this is for people with very highly pigmented lips, I think if your lips are only slightly darkened you won&#x27;t see much of a difference. I love this stuff so much that I&#x27;ve been wearing it literally around the clock. I wear it all day underneath all my lip products and I wear it to bed at night and so I haven&#x27;t seen any additional darkening of my lips. The smell took a bit to get used to since I&#x27;m not a fan of scents anywhere near my face and especially not on my lips, but I got used to it and got over it. This stuff works really well, and I&#x27;m about to purchase my second bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE-April 2014***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did go ahead and order a second bottle recently, but for some reason, it seems the formula has been changed and not for the better. Or maybe I got a one-off crap bottle, who knows.First, the new one was a completely different colour, the old one was a brown that was slightly red, the new one is cherry red and it smells much more fruity than the first. Also, where my first bottle functioned in the way it was designed, it also doubled very well as a moisturising lip balm, that I could wear alone for just a very slight hint of natural looking colour.

I spent a very painful week and a half afterwards, rehabbing my dried out lips. Another issue that I had was that it interfered with the colour of my lips products, although being brown, the first one did not, and because the texture was such that it sank into the lips, application of other products on top of it, wasn&#x27;t an issue. The new one, because it sits on top like oil and is an obvious red, mixed in with, and changed the colours of all my lipsticks and glosses.

    <li> The shipping came on time, but this product didn&#x27;t do what it was suppose to. In fact it did the complete opposite. Instead of making my lips lighter, it darkened my lips &amp; i have pretty sensitive lips so it made my lips feel like I have cuts on it. I usually would use a soft wash cloth to gently scrub off the dead skin &amp; I&#x27;m not normally bothered by that but this time, using this product, I was.</li>
    <li> It definitely works. tones out the lips</li>
    <li> It don&#x27;t work, don&#x27;t buy it! Unless you want to... It can still be used as lip balm but as far as whitening goes it just don&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> It gives a light beautiful color and smoothens lips very well. Very effective when compared to other chapsticks and also suits people with darker complexion!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t even waste ur money on this, it doesn&#x27;t do anything</li>
    <li> Fast shipping!!  Good quality packaging.  I would definitely order from this seller again.  Unfortunately, I have been using it for 3 weeks now. I don&#x27;t see a difference at all. Maybe I have to use it a little longer, but it doesn&#x27;t even really keep my lips moisturizer like other lip balms, because It easily comes off.</li>
    <li> Didnt lighten my lips at all.lip balm was reddish brown so i didnt like the color considering i want my lips lighter.smelled like fruits and it tasted pretty good though. i guess you would need to use it everyday for a few months to get amazing results</li>
    <li> Was a total waste - haven used it constantly for over 2 weeks it just have me dry lips</li>
    <li> It works very well, I use  the overnight almond lip balm at night then I use this one during the day time, and I love it. My lips are definitely lighter</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for two weeks.  I have not yet seen any real difference in my lip color, but it is very moisturizing.  My lips are very dry but Biotique makes them feel heavenly and soft and works well overnight and under lipstick.  There is a lot of it, so that&#x27;s good.  I will continue to use it day and night and hope for the best.  If&lt;br /&gt;Nothing  else, my lips are smoother than with anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I got a stain on my lips from having worn dental braces (dentist said must have been from biting my lips). Only used the cream for about 2 weeks. The stain did not disappear but it seems to have turned slightly lighter. The cream itself is good quality, smells nice, has a good consistency, is colored dark orange. As it is it cannot hurt, but not sure if it will remove my stain. Will keep trying.</li>
    <li> Im slowly seeing some results. I would buy this product again in the future. I would recommend it to others</li>
    <li> My skin tone has lightened up over the years but my lips stayed dark. After about two (2) weeks of using this product, my lips has lightened evenly to match my skin tone!</li>
    <li> This product began working by the next day. I noticed a slight lightness on my dark lips and has not stopped since the first application. The thing I like about it is that it is plant-based so no real danger of chemical reactions.</li>
    <li> I have yet to receive this purchase.  I am hoping I receive it soon and I hope evn more that it works!</li>
    <li> The product does work but you have to apply it several times a day and gently exfoliate your lips at night to see the results. It took a month for this to lighten a dark stain on my lip and still hasn&#x27;t lightened the darkness at the corners of my mouth. It takes time but I&#x27;m seeing results.</li>
    <li> products does not seem to work fast. maybe because I only use it at night or because my lips are  dark. I will not reorder this product.</li>
    <li> Use it every night nice moisture</li>
    <li> I like this product it  feels so good to my lips non greasy I would definitely recommend it!  It is already lightening my lips</li>
    <li> It has a chalky feel to it i d does give u a brown tint&lt;br /&gt;ont really see a difference for my lips but it</li>
    <li> Firstly, I have to say that I didn&#x27;t find this product to do a very good job at whitening the discoloration from my lips. But I have noticed that my lips are pinker. Maybe, I need to use the product longer? Regardless, I am happy with my purchase. The fruit balm smells great and has a nice orange-reddish tint to it (see picture). I find it to be pretty. It does provide excellent moisturization to the lips and makes your lips supple and soft. The smell and color are just added benefits. I would purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> It works. Best if you stop smoking while doing it.</li>
    <li> finally got my lip balm will update to let you know the progress</li>
    <li> I been tanning since I was 16 and now that I&#x27;m 19 I realize that my lips have darken to an ugly color so I bought this product to help lighten my lips up and it does nothing not even a good lip balm, It took over a month for it to arrive I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because it came from india ((so it said on box)) When Amazon sended me my receipt I saw on it it would take over a month to get here so I messaged the seller that I don&#x27;t want it anymore but they refused to refund me because it was out for shipment but whatever it was worth testing it out (I guess). The color is dark brown and stains rims of cups and when you kiss someone on the cheek also stains cheek, it&#x27;s not glossy and very drying to lips anyhow I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again, The tube does have alot on it though if I were to use it everyday it would proboly last me 3-5months. I saw no diffrence btw on lip lightening</li>
