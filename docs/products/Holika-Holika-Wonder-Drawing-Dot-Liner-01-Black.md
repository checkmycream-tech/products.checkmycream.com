      <li>This might work if you tight-line your lash line, but the ink isn&#x27;t very opaque either and not black enough to match black mascara.</li>

<li> While the eyeliner is extremely stubborn and waterproof (even on my eyes that tend to reject all eyeliners, even Urban Decay&#x27;s 24/7 liner and MAC&#x27;s fluidliner), it doesn&#x27;t have a standout color payoff.</li>

<li> it does smear and smudge if your eyes get wet though.</li>
<li> However, it&#x27;s harder to remove because of the staying power.</li>
<li> It stains your skin a little bit but nothing make up remover hasn&#x27;t helped for me.</li>
<li> I still had faded green eyeliner ghosts when I went to sleep.</li>
<li> I ordered this dot liner in #01 black!</li>
<li> that it&#x27;s a little hard to get off.</li>
<li> With the least bit of water it&#x27;s gone!</li>
<li> I got them confused.  </li>
<li> Not good if you have allergies or are going to a sad movie</li>
<li> This eyeliner is terrible.</li>

    <li> I like how easy this is to apply but it does not last at all. I guess this is why it is so cheap. If you are looking for long lasting keep looking.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is terrible. First off, the three tips are too flexible to draw a crisp, straight line for winged eyeliner. This might work if you tight-line your lash line, but the ink isn&#x27;t very opaque either and not black enough to match black mascara. All of these things would be somewhat bearable if it didn&#x27;t leave green-blue stains on your eyelids after removal. I wore the stuff for around 6 hours to a wedding and used 2 or 3 eye makeup removing pads to try to get it off.  I still had faded green eyeliner ghosts when I went to sleep. Wish I could return this.</li>
    <li> Much better than the more expensive Two Face or Claris. Better points on the eyeliner and actually lasted longer. Others dried out much faster.</li>
    <li> Goes on easily and makes nice fine lines and wingtips easy.  Not at all water resistant. With the least bit of water it&#x27;s gone! Not good if you have allergies or are going to a sad movie</li>
    <li> I suck at using liquid liner with brush tip. This is a lot easier to draw and easy to remove with makeup remover. Not water proof. Feels light on my eye lid.</li>
    <li> It goes on very light, youcan barely see it. I know to stick with my &amp;#34;Two Faced&amp;#34; eyeliner even if it cost more.</li>
    <li> Producty arrived quickly and I love love love this eye liner! So easy to put on, stays all day and come off with simple soap and water.</li>
    <li> easy to apply and long lasting. only thing is that it stays on so well that it&#x27;s a little hard to get off.</li>
    <li> I like the idea of this type of eyeliner.  I know that Too Faced makes one also, but I didn&#x27;t want to spend the $ on it without trying it first.  This was $8-9, so it was great for a test run.  For some reason I thought it was waterproof, which it is not.  The Too Faced one is.  I got them confused.  I like how it can be used when applying it.  Because it wasn&#x27;t waterproof, though, it drained into my eyes all day.  So props for the design.  When I get some extra cash I will invest in the Too Faced version.</li>
    <li> I really like this liner. It is easy to use, stays on well, and looks natural while still giving your eyes a little pop. I have used it for about 2 weeks and  seems to be running low already, though, so it&#x27;s yet to be seen how long it will last. I would like to try the one made by Too-Faced to compare. Great idea for the applicator, especially for people who have a hard time getting their eyeliner to look natural.</li>
    <li> I am not a big eyeliner person, and I like a very natural, thin line. This is amazing! I just dot it into where my lashes meet my eyelid and it makes my lashes look thicker and my eyes defined without looking like I have tons of makeup on! I hope they never stop making this, and the price is so right!</li>
    <li> overall, this eyeliner makes it easy to line your eyes. you can do thinner lines with ease as well as thicker lines when you angle the pen differently. the 3 prong makes it easy to fill in the spaces along the eyes if you&#x27;re not an eyeliner expert. it does smear and smudge if your eyes get wet though. the only downfall is that after you remove the eyeliner, it stains your skin a little. i&#x27;ve tried every eye makeup remover i have on hand and it doesn&#x27;t get rid of it. however, after you shower and wash your face with warm water, the stains do go away somehow after a little while.</li>
    <li> I personally love this eyeliner. It goes on even and smooth. It stains your skin a little bit but nothing make up remover hasn&#x27;t helped for me. As for the dots on it they work great to thicken my bottom lash line. It arrived earlier than the delivery date. I will buy this again. :)</li>
    <li> While the eyeliner is extremely stubborn and waterproof (even on my eyes that tend to reject all eyeliners, even Urban Decay&#x27;s 24/7 liner and MAC&#x27;s fluidliner), it doesn&#x27;t have a standout color payoff. However, with two coats, the eyeliner is exactly what I want. I ordered this dot liner in #01 black!</li>
    <li> This is really good for tightlining.  I haven&#x27;t had an issue with smudging, but I always use primer.  It did start to disappear after about seven hours.  I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
    <li> Very versatile pencil. I like the dotting feature if you just want a light line this gives you the option</li>
    <li> this item works very well just dot between lashes and your done and it looks great so easy to use</li>
    <li> I love this dot liner so much. After waiting so long for it to ship from Korea. Totally worth it. Absolutely amazing and convenient. Saves me a lot of time every morning.</li>
    <li> Though it isnt waterproof it works wonderfully for the day/night. I do not wear a lot of makeup and this is perfect for a natural improvement. You can dot neatly between lashes.. AND you can use it for a solid line.</li>
    <li> This product has an awesome design and very functional. Easy to use and it does not smear even if you rub your eyes. I actually use my gel liner first then use this to dot between my eyelashes. However, it&#x27;s harder to remove because of the staying power. It won&#x27;t stop me from using this though!</li>
    <li> This liner is amazing and really easy to use.  Easy to take off?  Not as much but it&#x27;s worth the way this looks while wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will order again.</li>
