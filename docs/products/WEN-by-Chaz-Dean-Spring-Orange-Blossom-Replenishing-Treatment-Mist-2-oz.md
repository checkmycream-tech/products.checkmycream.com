      <li>Great product, use lightly.</li>
      <li>If you are a WEN girl, you know that this stuff is amazing.</li>
      <li>I ordered this product, hoping it would be a nice &amp;#34;boost&amp;#34; to my hair (hydrating-wise) between washings.  </li>
      <li>but it does smell really nice.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s handy for my desk</li>

      <li>💘.....need more.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>Love the replenishing spray between shampoos.</li>
      <li>This, however, smells SO good that I don&#x27;t care if it is real -</li>
      <li>I spray it on my hair for a burst of sweet scent.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s about all this is worth.</li>
      <li>Because this is a small sample size that you would normally get free if you order from Wen directly I really love this limited edition scent and the treatment mist is perfect for revitilizing my curls or just providing a freshing to my hair.  </li>
      <li>Other than smelling good</li>
      <li>Very dissatified!</li>
      <li>As much as Wen costs, I am sure they can add sealing to the final product.</li>
      <li>special other than it smells fabulous.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t see much replenishing going on</li>
      <li>The sent was very chemical.</li>
      <li>Also they really should SEAL the item.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair ready for styling.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really conflicted here.  </li>
      <li>As I posted under other Wen products on here, I can&#x27;t determine if they are authentic or not.  </li>
      <li>wish it did.my hair which is fine and curls show really no difference...in texture or manageability.  </li>
      <li>I had considered returning it as I was misled to think this was the normal size bottle and not an overpriced sample.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d normally give this a 4 star.  </li>
      <li>but some don&#x27;t seem to leave my hair as soft as products I purchased directly from the supplier after prolonged use.</li>
      <li>I was a little surprised at how small the bottle was, but honestly I don&#x27;t use much of it</li>

<li> doesn&#x27;t hold up long...</li>
<li> I spray it on my hair before bed, put my hair up, and in the morning, my hair is soft and fluffy.  </li>
<li> THIS MIST ADDS MOISTURE TO YOUR HAIR AFTER A LONG DAY OF HEAT AND HUMIDITY.  </li>
<li> I do NOT know what other people were smelling in this product, but this scent is definitely NOT anything like Orange Blossom!!!</li>
<li> Not really worth the price.</li>
<li> Knocked down 1 because this scent is so so.  </li>
<li> I use it everyday.</li>
<li> And much too expensive for the bottle size!</li>
<li> As usual for WEN you either like it or not.</li>
<li> yet so delicate....</li>
<li> Obsessed with orange blossom scent.</li>
<li> sorry I don&#x27;t know what else to say, you are the one wanting a review.</li>

<ol>
    <li> Smells awesome. Works great too. Great seller</li>
    <li> If you are a WEN girl, you know that this stuff is amazing. I use it everyday. I have many of the smells, this smells like you are walking in a orange grove. it is one of my favorites</li>
    <li> 💘.....need more. Obsessed with orange blossom scent. Face &amp; neck love it. Smooths out wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Other than smelling good that&#x27;s about all this is worth. On time shipping. Not really worth the price.</li>
    <li> Love the replenishing spray between shampoos. Knocked down 1 because this scent is so so.  Makes my hair ready for styling.  As usual for WEN you either like it or not.</li>
    <li> THIS MIST ADDS MOISTURE TO YOUR HAIR AFTER A LONG DAY OF HEAT AND HUMIDITY.  MAKES YOUR HAIR LOOK AND SMELL GREAT!! I LOVE WEN:)</li>
    <li> this is great just like all WEN products. Smells just like orange blossoms. sorry I don&#x27;t know what else to say, you are the one wanting a review. you got it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d normally give this a 4 star.  Because this is a small sample size that you would normally get free if you order from Wen directly I really love this limited edition scent and the treatment mist is perfect for revitilizing my curls or just providing a freshing to my hair.  I had considered returning it as I was misled to think this was the normal size bottle and not an overpriced sample.  It&#x27;s handy for my desk so I kept it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I have no idea if it does anything special other than it smells fabulous.  It also isn&#x27;t sticky or gunky.  I was a little surprised at how small the bottle was, but honestly I don&#x27;t use much of it so I think it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> SMELLS LIKE CAT URINE</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see much replenishing going on but it does smell really nice.</li>
    <li> Great product, use lightly.</li>
    <li> I have used Wen Shampoo for 7 years, and love what it has done to my hair.  I ordered this product, hoping it would be a nice &amp;#34;boost&amp;#34; to my hair (hydrating-wise) between washings.  I love this product.  I spray it on my hair before bed, put my hair up, and in the morning, my hair is soft and fluffy.  And the smell of this orange blossom is wonderful.  I actually would like it as a perfume.  The only thing I will do differently next time is order a larger size.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really conflicted here.  The scent is so delish..yet so delicate....doesn&#x27;t hold up long...wish it did.my hair which is fine and curls show really no difference...in texture or manageability.  So what am I getting here?  Not really  enough to recommend.</li>
    <li> I do NOT know what other people were smelling in this product, but this scent is definitely NOT anything like Orange Blossom!!! Mine smelled like chemical GARDENIA. Ugggh! Horrid! And much too expensive for the bottle size! Returning this product! Also they really should SEAL the item. As much as Wen costs, I am sure they can add sealing to the final product. Very dissatified!</li>
    <li> As I posted under other Wen products on here, I can&#x27;t determine if they are authentic or not.  They work well but some don&#x27;t seem to leave my hair as soft as products I purchased directly from the supplier after prolonged use. This, however, smells SO good that I don&#x27;t care if it is real - I spray it on my hair for a burst of sweet scent.</li>
    <li> I will definitely buy this again!  It smells fantastic!  It smells just like orange blossoms.  It makes my hair smell very good.</li>
    <li> The sent was very chemical.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff ... smells great!</li>
