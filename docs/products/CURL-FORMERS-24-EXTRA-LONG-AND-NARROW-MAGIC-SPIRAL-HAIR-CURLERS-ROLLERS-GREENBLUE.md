      <li>These rollers gave me the most perfect curl set I&#x27;ve ever had on my hair without a relaxer and without any heat.</li>
      <li>Had good result.</li>
      <li>My husband didn&#x27;t care, he just laughed at me.</li>
      <li>They produce a good looking curl, but I had some problems with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>For the price, I&#x27;m very pleased with what I got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>There are a ton of companies that sell the knock off curl formers, which I love, for a great price.</li>
      <li>I love these!</li>
      <li>It leaves great curl and is easy to use and order.</li>
      <li>These were easy to use and make a great curl.</li>
      <li>The curls came out nice but it took me over an hour to get all of the curlers in.  </li>
      <li>These were kind of flimsy compared to store brand.  </li>
      <li>but I got a wonderful full head of the most adorable ringlettes..</li>
      <li>good, they were easy to use, I would probably have to sit under the dryer to get these to stick.</li>
      <li>I used these on our 10 year old daughter and she and I were both very happy with the results.  </li>
      <li>&amp;#60;&amp;#60; this isn&#x27;t a super sexy look though, so keep that in mind if you are sleeping with someone you want to have find you attractive.</li>
      <li>but the results are great if you use the right products with them.....,</li>
      <li>I love, love, love these!</li>
      <li>Great quality exactly what I expected...loved the curls .</li>
      <li>It got my roots very smooth.</li>
      <li>These are perfect for straight hair that doesn&#x27;t take a curl easy and they are perfect for my long hair</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>Just wish that they would advertise appropriately</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never got so many compliments on my hair style</li>
      <li>thing I DID love was that they sent me 4 hooks which makes it easier to put the curlers in your hair.</li>
      <li>I am enjoying this product</li>
      <li>She was able to sleep in them.  </li>
      <li>Could NOT be happier with this product...unless it came with a bottle of Advil. :-)</li>
      <li>Also this takes more time, which for me defeats the purpose because I can curl my hair faster with a curling iron than it took me to do all</li>
      <li>These work ok, but the curls are noticeable wider than with the comparable ones purchased at Sally&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Since I wanted to be able to do this at night and sleep in them</li>
      <li>However there are ways to help this if you are creative.</li>
      <li>so now I must buy more.  </li>
      <li>(There are better deals on Ebay).</li>
      <li>I love the results after use.</li>
      <li>Its says I have to write eleven more words....</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll love them.  </li>
      <li>so make sure to re-wet as your hair dries while putting on.</li>
      <li>so I did :-)</li>
      <li>I love my curls.  </li>
      <li>Very sturdy material and made my curls look great.</li>
      <li>She paid a lot more for them at a beauty show.</li>
      <li>so I will be ordering more.    </li>
      <li>thing I DID love was that they sent me 4 hooks which makes it easier to put the curlers in your hair.</li>
      <li>I plan to get more soon.</li>
      <li>Curls wonderfully and easily with my coarse hair</li>
      <li>so what I did is I doubled up each curl with two (one on top of the other) and it came out great!  </li>
      <li>This also makes it so much more comfortable to sleep</li>
      <li>This also makes it so much more comfortable to sleep</li>
      <li>Also, they go on best if you have your hair really wet</li>
      <li>The loser orange and pink curlers still gave us excellent spiral curls, but were easier and quicker to put in.  </li>
      <li>The curlers are easy to put in.  </li>
      <li>They are easy to put it.</li>
      <li>I already had the TRUE Curlformers, which are better.  </li>
      <li>They arrived very fast and they very easy to use.</li>
      <li>They are a cheap version of curlformers.</li>
      <li>They aren&#x27;t comfortable to lay/ sleep on though.</li>
      <li>After going back to watch the tutorials and finding my own way of how to hook and tighten at the root, I was able to accomplish most of my hair.</li>
      <li>Comfortable?</li>
      <li>Fortunately I had the curlformer wand.</li>
      <li>However, it works just as well as the original.</li>
      <li>applied right before puttin it in, leave in for at least three hours and u will have flawless curls :)</li>
      <li>I can say that real curlformers have been easier to use, have more consistent curls and release better than those knockoffs.</li>
      <li>These are cool and fun to use and easy to order.</li>
      <li>The product is really good, but it is not the same as the original curlformers.</li>
      <li>Overall good product.</li>
      <li>These weren&#x27;t much longer than the curlformers which was what I was most looking forward to, if my hair grows any longer then I won&#x27;t be able to use them which was the main reason I bought these&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It really works!!  </li>
      <li>I just really wish I paid attention to what amazon said the delivery time frame would be and not the great big sign that says FAST DELIVERY NOW FROM THE US!</li>
      <li>so it doesn&#x27;t leave obvious creases (about an inch off the scalp works best because u can hide the creases from the closure) and do it on dry hair with curling cream</li>
      <li>But then I started taking them out and separating my perfectly smooth curls and decided that maybe I&#x27;d just have to find a way to sleep on them more comfortably in future.</li>
      <li>Its more comfortable if you don&#x27;t put the curler all the way up to the scalp and leave space in the back to have a place to part the curlers</li>
      <li>Looked more natural.</li>
      <li>These are fun curlers.  </li>
      <li>Since I had no idea how to use this type of curlers, instructions would have been helpful and a note when purchasing that an additional purchase of the pull through rod would also be needed would have been useful.</li>
      <li>My first hair set turned out very good despite the fact I should have bought a second one since my hair and head is so big.  </li>
      <li>wouldn&#x27;t recommend this curler to someone unless they have hair longer than 18&amp;#34; and want to put the curler right at their roots.</li>
      <li>wouldn&#x27;t recommend this curler to someone unless they have hair longer than 18&amp;#34; and want to put the curler right at their roots.</li>
      <li>I will think of purchasing more in the future for the front, but I&#x27;m going to research sturdier ones</li>
      <li>First time I saw them were in one of Naptural85 videos</li>
      <li>This product is exactly what it claims to be.  </li>
      <li>I returned these ones and bought the real brand curlers!</li>
      <li>advertise fast delivery from the US!</li>
      <li>It was exactly what was promised.</li>
      <li>These are good and healthy on the hair since don&#x27;t require heat, but I find them incredibly hard to put in without ripping my hair out!!</li>
      <li>a more positive note, we have some of knock off curlformers from a different manufacturer.</li>
      <li>The texture is slightly softer than original ones, which are more sturdier.</li>
      <li>, the regular long and narrow curlformers work just fine in my hair; keeping them 1-2 inches from my scalp makes the length perfect.</li>
      <li>tedious.nch poodle look, the regular long and narrow curlformers work just fine in my hair; keeping them 1-2 inches from my scalp makes the length perfect.</li>
      <li>when you are ready to remove them, run your finger along the curler starting at the top to help straighten it out and then slide it off...</li>
      <li>They are too large for my hair, so I have to return them.</li>
      <li>I usually use a giant curling iron to just give my fine, straight hair some body, but I tried these curlers and I loved the look of curly hair....</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I thought the spiral size was smaller than the actual product is. They are too large for my hair, so I have to return them.</li>
    <li> Great quality exactly what I expected...loved the curls . Its says I have to write eleven more words.... so I did :-)</li>
    <li> The curl formers are magical, they are a little hard to sleep in but the results are great if you use the right products with them.....,</li>
    <li> These are cool and fun to use and easy to order. It leaves great curl and is easy to use and order.</li>
    <li> There were a few times in using these \\&quot;Curlformers\\&quot; that I almost gave up.  The rod got stuck in one of them &amp; I had to cut the roller off to get it out.  Also, the rod kept coming apart &amp; I had to tape it together.  The curls came out nice but it took me over an hour to get all of the curlers in.  I&#x27;m hoping with some practice it will be easier.</li>
    <li> I have been eyeing the curlformers for quite sometime now. First time I saw them were in one of Naptural85 videos and I knew I just had to have them. At first I was not sure on what size to get. But then I finally decided on the long and narrow. Instead of ordering from Sally Beauty Supply or straight from the Curlformers website I went onto Amazon and purchased a 24 pack for $26.99 (There are better deals on Ebay). Now I have to admit, these things take some getting use to. The first time I tried these it took about 3 hours to put in, breaking a few from the hook getting caught and the hook not catching all the hair. The second time around the process went much smoother. After it was all said and done I loved the results! It got my roots very smooth. The major downfall for me though would be that it takes so many to cover my whole head because I have SUPER THICK hair. I used 46 Curlformers and it barely covered the back so I will be ordering more.    [...]</li>
    <li> I already had the TRUE Curlformers, which are better.  I bought these to supplement when I need a few more to finish the job.  These must be made in China. They smelled so bad of chemicals that I set it out in my backyard for three weeks and it still smelled up them room when I brought them back in.  I soak them in baking soda several times, and dried them.  The smell is still there, but It no longer fills up the whole room.  I am afraid to use them in my hair, which that chemical smell. Will they do the job? Yes. Think twice before purchasing.  I am sticking with the REAL Curlformers.</li>
    <li> these are wider than the narrow curl formers, the actual curl formers curls hold better, I used the same product and these curls died within about an hour of me taking them down. several of these curlers were damaged. the ends looked chewed up and sealed were I couldn&#x27;t get the wand through. I bought two bags and one of the bags was missing the bottom half of the wand. The other bag had both pieces but I couldn&#x27;t get the wand together. Fortunately I had the curlformer wand. These weren&#x27;t much longer than the curlformers which was what I was most looking forward to, if my hair grows any longer then I won&#x27;t be able to use them which was the main reason I bought these&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good, they were easy to use, I would probably have to sit under the dryer to get these to stick. I am not sure.</li>
    <li> I used these on our 10 year old daughter and she and I were both very happy with the results.  She was able to sleep in them.  The order was delivered in two days.  The product smelled fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave only three stars because half of the hook tool was missing from the set, and because two of the curlers were somewhat damaged.  In our case, neither was a problem.  I had a hook tool from another set, and as our daughter&#x27;s hair isn&#x27;t long enough to fill the whole curl former the breakage at one end wan&#x27;t a problem.  The two curlers with holes in the mesh were still usable.  For the price, I&#x27;m very pleased with what I got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People should be advised though that you really can&#x27;t put a lot of hair in these tight spiral curlers.  The loser orange and pink curlers still gave us excellent spiral curls, but were easier and quicker to put in.  I will continue to use these in combination with the &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; size.  I&#x27;d lose my mind trying to do her whole head with them though, and if I had to buy just one size it would be the orange and pink ones, not these.</li>
    <li> These were easy to use and make a great curl. My hair is a little bit longer than the roller so I just pin curled the ends with a couple of bobby pins.</li>
    <li> my daughter has very long hair and a lot of it, these kept getting stuck and hurt her head, i was looking for something to curl her hair that would also be comfortable to sleep with, these were not, i returned them</li>
    <li> These are fun curlers.  They did not come with any directions though so we had to You Tube how to use them.  They aren&#x27;t comfortable to lay/ sleep on though.</li>
    <li> I love the results after use. I use two packs, it takes me over an our to put them in. I wish I could find shorter ones.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s super difficult to use, I gave up and sent them back. You need at least one hour to do your hair, and by pulling your hair tru the curl formers you might get a little bald in a couple of times.</li>
    <li> My hair dresser introduced mr to this one day. She paid a lot more for them at a beauty show.</li>
    <li> These are awesome! They are a cheap version of curlformers. The only con is the materials sheds after a few uses, on a few of them. I believe I bought 3 packs and use about 2 and a half for my head.</li>
    <li> They work well but are not easy to sleep in.  Also, they go on best if you have your hair really wet so make sure to re-wet as your hair dries while putting on.</li>
    <li> I usually use a giant curling iron to just give my fine, straight hair some body, but I tried these curlers and I loved the look of curly hair....and it lasted for 2 days!  It did take a few tries to get them in without pulling hair.</li>
    <li> Delivery was fast, the product is not easy to use and the quality of the curlformer hook is a very bad material  the extender broke at the moment of use it. Hair tangle and take long to get dry.</li>
    <li> Curls wonderfully and easily with my coarse hair</li>
    <li> My hair was too long for these (it&#x27;s realllly long) so what I did is I doubled up each curl with two (one on top of the other) and it came out great!  Needless to say I had to make each curl a little thicker than I would have like so now I must buy more.  lol</li>
    <li> It really works!!  They also straighten my hair with little shrinkage and they do not pull your hair.  I will recommend these to my friends.</li>
    <li> My girls all have long, thick hair and using sponge rollers can be a hassle, especially when trying to get them out.  I bought 2 sets of these hoping it would be easier.  First, let me say that I had no trouble getting the hair in to the curlers.  It takes a little extra time to get them done, but I did it without ever watching a video.  As far as comfort, they are awful to sleep in.  My daughter had a terrible time trying to get comfortable as they are kind of hard.  The end result.....beautiful curls.  I do want to add that your hair needs to be damp and probably use a bit of hair gel.  Dry hair does not work well at all with these.  My final thought....if you don&#x27;t mind the discomfort while sleeping, these are perfect and a lot less expensive than the name brand.</li>
    <li> They produce a good looking curl, but I had some problems with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When they say extra long, they mean it. They are 24&amp;#34; unstreched. Which was longer than I imagined they would be. My hair is about 16&amp;#34; which I thought was a decent length. But after using these long curlers a few time I realized the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* they are too long for me. 16&amp;#34; of hair only took up 1/2 of the curler when it was coiled up.&lt;br /&gt;*because of the length of the curler, they didn&#x27;t want to stay on the hook very well.&lt;br /&gt;* it was a bit hard to get the curler on my hair because once I started pulling the hair through, I had to completely extend my arm just to get the hook to the bottom of the curler, sometimes I had to let go and grab the hook again in order to get the hook out.&lt;br /&gt;*because of the length, they are EXTREMELY uncomfortable to sleep in. However there are ways to help this if you are creative. I took my daughters small plastic hair ties, and bent each curler in half and put a hair ties around each one, so I had a head full of loops. Then I put them in sections of 3-4 and put another hair ties around those, then put on a silky sleeping cap. Comfortable? not really... Do-able? yes. Its more comfortable if you don&#x27;t put the curler all the way up to the scalp and leave space in the back to have a place to part the curlers so you can sleep on a somewhat flat spot. &amp;#60;&amp;#60; this isn&#x27;t a super sexy look though, so keep that in mind if you are sleeping with someone you want to have find you attractive. My husband didn&#x27;t care, he just laughed at me. But 5 years ago it might have mattered; at least to me. Also this takes more time, which for me defeats the purpose because I can curl my hair faster with a curling iron than it took me to do all this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I wanted to be able to do this at night and sleep in them I decided to just go to sally&#x27;s and buy the real deal. Since I decided putting the curler right up to the scalp gave me a french poodle look, the regular long and narrow curlformers work just fine in my hair; keeping them 1-2 inches from my scalp makes the length perfect. This also makes it so much more comfortable to sleep in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this curler to someone unless they have hair longer than 18&amp;#34; and want to put the curler right at their roots. But if your hair is 18&amp;#34; or shorter, the regular size would probably be better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I DID love was that they sent me 4 hooks which makes it easier to put the curlers in your hair. If you have a second person helping they can put the curler on the hook while your put the hair through the curler (or vice versa) or if doing it alone, you only have to stop every 4 curls load your next 4 and repeat, which makes it less tedious.nch poodle look, the regular long and narrow curlformers work just fine in my hair; keeping them 1-2 inches from my scalp makes the length perfect.

    <li> These are knock offs and they are harder than original curl formers so you can&#x27;t sleep as well in them but your curl is straighter for you natural girls!...these are really long just go one side down or more if your hair isn&#x27;t pass your bra strap.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying this product</li>
    <li> took a few tries and you-tube videos to get it right, but no matter the tries I still ended up with the best curls ever...I&#x27;ve never got so many compliments on my hair style and I&#x27;m told I look younger and like a baby doll :0)!</li>
    <li> Since I had no idea how to use this type of curlers, instructions would have been helpful and a note when purchasing that an additional purchase of the pull through rod would also be needed would have been useful.</li>
    <li> Like the curl formers. Was a little tricky putting them in at first but then I got use to it. Had good result. Would love to have the extra long and wide formers. Wish it came with a storage container.</li>
    <li> These curlers are hard and you cant even get the smallest piece of hair through one of them. DO NOT BUY!!!!! These are a WASTE of money and not worth your money. I should have never bought the off brand curlers. You should buy the pink and orange brand curlers. I returned these ones and bought the real brand curlers!</li>
    <li> takes a long time to do</li>
    <li> These were kind of flimsy compared to store brand.  The stick was hard to push through.</li>
    <li> I love these! I had to YouTube the crap outta them before I figured out how to use them, but they work amazingly!!! My advise, don&#x27;t do it on the scalp so it doesn&#x27;t leave obvious creases (about an inch off the scalp works best because u can hide the creases from the closure) and do it on dry hair with curling cream applied right before puttin it in, leave in for at least three hours and u will have flawless curls :)</li>
    <li> These work ok, but the curls are noticeable wider than with the comparable ones purchased at Sally&#x27;s. the hook is also really long, which mad it feel awkward to use.</li>
    <li> These worked out and gave me the same results as the original curl formers, but you can tell that they&#x27;re not made by the same manufacturers. The texture is slightly softer than original ones, which are more sturdier. I have natural hair with a good length past my shoulders and the product worked like the real thing. Just wish that they would advertise appropriately so people know what they&#x27;re getting. So 4 stars is because of the false advertisement. Overall good product.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love these! I have thick, tightly coiled African American hair and these keep my hair detangled and looking great! You will need 2 packs though. They come with the hook too, so you save money. These are a must have for natural hair!</li>
    <li> I was very happy with the ending results of the curlformers.  I love my curls.  I wish i would have come up with the idea.  :)</li>
    <li> The product is really good, but it is not the same as the original curlformers. I was a little disappointed we I got them and saw how long they were and that the texture is different from the real curlformers product. However, it works just as well as the original.</li>
    <li> These are perfect for straight hair that doesn&#x27;t take a curl easy and they are perfect for my long hair</li>
    <li> These are good and healthy on the hair since don&#x27;t require heat, but I find them incredibly hard to put in without ripping my hair out!! I don&#x27;t know if I just haven&#x27;t mastered the technique or what.</li>
    <li> These are not actual Curlformers. They&#x27;re a dupe product. After a truly horrible night of sleeping on them, I woke up swearing that I&#x27;d never use them again. Sore neck, sore back, the works. These guys are really HARD. But then I started taking them out and separating my perfectly smooth curls and decided that maybe I&#x27;d just have to find a way to sleep on them more comfortably in future. These rollers gave me the most perfect curl set I&#x27;ve ever had on my hair without a relaxer and without any heat. I have long, natural 3c-4a hair. I applied these to damp detangled hair and let it set over night. Could NOT be happier with this product...unless it came with a bottle of Advil. :-)</li>
    <li> CONS&lt;br /&gt;They advertise fast delivery from the US! They LIE. It&#x27;s coming straight from China which means you have to wait for a month to recieve your order. There are a ton of companies that sell the knock off curl formers, which I love, for a great price. I just really wish I paid attention to what amazon said the delivery time frame would be and not the great big sign that says FAST DELIVERY NOW FROM THE US! With that said, I can&#x27;t really comment on how their product works because it&#x27;ll be a few more weeks before I recieve it. Dang it!!!&lt;br /&gt;On a more positive note, we have some of knock off curlformers from a different manufacturer. They work extremely well. They are easy to put it. The girls don&#x27;t have a problem sleeping with them in their hair. There is a trick to this though. Give the hair about 2-3 inches of slack before the curler actually starts. I really wanted to put them in close to the scalp, that makes it uncomfortable to sleep in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update! The product has been delivered after a month of waiting. Of course it&#x27;s coming from China not what they claim. I didn&#x27;t get what I ordered. I received flexi rods not the curl formers I ordered. I&#x27;m very sad. I waited a month for really thin red sticks. I filed the complaint and hopefully I will have my money back soon.  Very disappointing. Not worth the wait. :(</li>
    <li> I think I would really like these if I could figure out how to use them properly.  I keep pulling my hair which is very natural ... ouch!  Once I figure it out I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll love them.  Oh yea, one of the stems I had a hard time putting it together; I had to shave some of the plastic off on the side so it could slide in the other piece.</li>
    <li> Great for the value for curl formers. Works very well for my hair and my daughter who has natural hair. I plan to get more soon.</li>
    <li> Very sturdy material and made my curls look great. Would recommend to others.  Do they come in smaller sizes ?</li>
    <li> I like the rollers. They arrived very fast and they very easy to use. The only bad thing is the rods do not stay to gather they always come a loose when your doing your hair.</li>
    <li> False advertisement they ARE NOT NARROW! In fact the pink and orange give a tighter curl than these and their just an inch or two longer than the Orange and pink. I have both if I could show a picture so you can see for yourself I would! The picture is deceiving.</li>
    <li> Not long or narrow as advertised.  Just regular sized wide knockoffs.  The openings are less slanted and firm than real curlformers. Since these were neither long nor narrow I haven&#x27;t used them.  However, I have some wide knockoffs that look just like them and are exactly the same size and shape.  I can say that real curlformers have been easier to use, have more consistent curls and release better than those knockoffs.</li>
    <li> I seen this on a Youtube Hair Guru as well and that is what attracted me. I&#x27;m transitioning from relaxed to natural and felt this was one option I can work into my hair routines with style. They did arrive early so as soon as I got the box, I went to work on my hair and then trying to apply these. At first I couldn&#x27;t hook correctly, I was harshly pulling my hair and my hair was becoming to dry so I had to reapply my leave-in and water. After going back to watch the tutorials and finding my own way of how to hook and tighten at the root, I was able to accomplish most of my hair. I began from the back and did not have enough for my front so I did twist w/ a bantu knot. I will think of purchasing more in the future for the front, but I&#x27;m going to research sturdier ones, that&#x27;s the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5. I&#x27;m going to leave it like this for a while, because I still liked how it came out when I mixed my twist in the front to the back curls. Looked more natural.</li>
    <li> The curl formers that I have are too wide and was not what I ordered! These are NOT NARROW at all!!!</li>
    <li> These only got a star so I could wrote a review.. didn&#x27;t like em at all. I felt like they pulled my hair and that&#x27;s a no no in the natural hair care world</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what it claims to be.  My daughter&#x27;s hair is beautiful. The curlers are easy to put in.  I would recommend this product to anyone who has hair that doesn&#x27;t hold a curl.</li>
    <li> I had never seen any version of this product before so I have no comparison to \\&quot;the real thing\\&quot; as mentioned in the other reviews...  I have very long hair, half way down my back, and I have wanted to test out what a spiral perm would look like.. I suspect this is not quite what it would look like in reality but I got a wonderful full head of the most adorable ringlettes.. It took me several tries to figure out how to actually pull all of my hair through the tube and eventually found that it worked much better for me when my hair was half dry.  The tubes are soft enough in nature that I slept in them.. my hair is so thick that it took a full 12 hours to dry in the tubes and even when I pulled them off in the morning it was still a bit damp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TWO HINTS:  1) when pulling your hair through the tube mak sure that the tube is hanging straight down and your hair is gathered carefully in the hook so that the section of hair runs smoothly through the end of hook and is not &#x27;parted&#x27; by the tip of the hook...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) when you are ready to remove them, run your finger along the curler starting at the top to help straighten it out and then slide it off... otherwise it acts like a \\&quot;Chinese Handcuff\\&quot; and just grabs and holds your hair for dear life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like them.. it offers me a way to curl my hair all the way to the very tips without having leftover hair that sticks out hear and there the way it does when I have attempted to use curlers in the past.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what was promised. My first hair set turned out very good despite the fact I should have bought a second one since my hair and head is so big.  It didn&#x27;t arrive when it was supposed to and I actually had to email them and ask what the hold up was. They responded back quickly and two days later I had my package.</li>
    <li> The are great for cheerleading. I got them for my boyfriends daughter cheerleading competitions. So much easier than using a curling iron. You&amp;#34;ll get nice tight curls without having to do much.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try something new for my wife and she loves this because you can go to sleep with it if you don&#x27;t want to use a hair dryer.</li>
