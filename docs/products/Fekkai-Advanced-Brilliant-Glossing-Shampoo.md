      <li>I have fine hair</li>
      <li>Her hair is very fine and much shorter than mine, and it gave her hair much more bounce and shine.  </li>
      <li>It really does leave your hair with a nice shine.  </li>

      <li>Recommended years ago by my stylist for weekly use to clean away the residue left by other products.</li>
      <li>The only draw back is the cost is extremely to high.</li>

    <li> Wonderful Shampoo....wish you had the 32oz bottle.  Will only use this shampoo on my hair. Used to buy it at Saks Fifth Avenue</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!  I have color treated hair and use a blow dryer and flat iron every day.  As a result, my hair became dull and dry looking.  This shampoo (and accompanying conditioner) does exaclty what it says:  provides a brilliant glossing shine. I would have never thought that at age 48 my hair could look as shiny and soft as it did when I was 20 -- but it does!  Thank you, Fekkai!</li>
    <li> I have long (I&#x27;m asian) hair that is fairly straight but will get frizzy w/out flat ironing. I have tried a few of Fekkai&#x27;s haircare lines and this one is just Ok. I felt that it left my hair shiny but with a \\&quot;film\\&quot; feeling and a bit of weight. My hair type responds Great to his Salon Techinician color care line so I will use that one instead of this.</li>
    <li> I bought the little bottles of this line and I love the smell.  Yummy.  So then I bought the larger bottles.  After two months of use my hair was a dry birds nest.  I thought it might be because of summer even though I never go in the sun.  Then I used the other Fekkai colored hair formula, the pink one and in one washing , my hair was less of a dry frizz mess.  This stuff was just not for me.  I love the smell but the result was drying. Maybe it will be okay for you though.  At least at frist</li>
    <li> I am a bzz agent and was fortunate enough to receive the advanced brilliant Glossing Shampoo as well as conditioner and glossing creme. My hair has looked great ever since. You might at first be a little put off by the price but I feel a little goes a long way . It rinses out beautiful and the olive oil is so nourishing. I feel like I am using  great salon products everytime I use this full line.And I am</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells terrific and delivers the glossy shine that it promises. I have fine hair that&#x27;s pretty oily, and I was concerned that this product would make my hair greasy, but it doesn&#x27;t. Still, Fekkai products are INSANELY expensive, and although I like the shampoo, I won&#x27;t be splurging on it regularly.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a shampoo that would give my hair the shine that I see with other women&#x27;s hair but had been unable to find for myself.  This product does it for me!  I use the shampoo and conditioner.  Well worth the expense in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Good product... smell great.. It makes hair really good and shiny. Product was delivered before the time..  I am in love with this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I received a bottle of Fekkai Glossing Shampoo as a part of a BzzCampaign, where they asked me to try the product and review it on the web.  After using the shampoo and conditioner for three weeks , I find my hair no different in texture than when using cheaper &#x27;drugstore&#x27; brands (I have thick, wavy, 50% grey, chin length hair).  The only difference is that the Fekkai shampoo smells amazing.  Is that worth the extra $15+ per bottle?  Not for me.  If you want a real luxury shampoo, try another brand.  UPDATE:  I let my mother use the shampoo for a week and she liked it much more than I did.  Her hair is very fine and much shorter than mine, and it gave her hair much more bounce and shine.  Perhaps it comes down to your hair type.</li>
    <li> Burned my eyes so badly I threw it out. Be careful using this heinous product.</li>

    <li> People compliment on my hair all the time ever since I started using this product. My hair is shiny and full thanks to this product.</li>
    <li> I have tried MANY shampoos and conditioners to make my hair shiny. This one BY FAR the best in the bunch.  I&#x27;ve never seen my coarse heavy hair shine as much as when I use this product.  Even if you just use the shampoo and not the conditioner...it&#x27;s something in the shampoo that leaves my hair so shiny like I just left the salon and got a shine treatment. I have color treated hair (dark brown) and use heat on it almost every single day.  THIS SHAMPOO IS A MUST IF YOU WANT UNBELIEVABLE SHINY HAIR!!</li>
    <li> I love this glossing shampoo.  It really does leave your hair with a nice shine.  I will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Recommended years ago by my stylist for weekly use to clean away the residue left by other products. Becoming harder to find as the company tries to &amp;#34;glam&amp;#34; up its products. Still the best on the market.</li>

    <li> This is one of the best shampoo as far as the smell.The only draw back is the cost is extremely to high. Dont think i will be ordering anymore</li>
    <li> I recently died my hair purple, and before washing it with a purple shampoo, I use this shampoo to just clean, it hasn&#x27;t even faded the color! &amp;#60;3 it</li>
    <li> Could this shampoo really be worth the price??  ABSOLUTELY!!  Not only does it give my hair great shine, the smell is terrific, too.</li>
    <li> I always get compliments on my hair.  Everyone says it is healthy and shinny.  I owe it all to Frederic Fekkai.</li>
    <li> It does everything it says it does. My short hair turns out looking like a glossy little cap every time.</li>
    <li> Great product,it made my hair full body . I would  recommend to friend, but hey I keep it all for myself. Love, Love! Thank you !</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after trying another Fekkai product. I alternate between this product and the Technician Color Care shampoo. I have  fine hair and this doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. Leaves my hair shiny and silky.</li>
    <li> Not only does the shampoo have an unpleasant (to me) artifical smell, but it is made up of mostly chemicals.  Its not what I had been hoping for.</li>
    <li> My hair is dry and can be frizzy especially in humid weather. This products works better than anything I have tried, including other Fekkai shampoo/conditioners. I buy it in bulk.</li>
