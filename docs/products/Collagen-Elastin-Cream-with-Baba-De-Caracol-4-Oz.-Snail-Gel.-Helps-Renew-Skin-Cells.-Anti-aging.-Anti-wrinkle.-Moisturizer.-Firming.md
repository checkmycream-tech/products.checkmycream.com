      <li>I really don&#x27;t see what this product does.</li>
      <li>and it does leave your skin nice and soft, do not really know about the properties of the Baba de Caracol,</li>
      <li>I would say to use it somewhere other than your face until you&#x27;re sure you won&#x27;t have a reaction to it.  </li>
      <li>Nada de particular, tiene muy poca baba de caracol por eso es como cualquier otra crema economica.</li>
      <li>A FEW MORE DAYS</li>
      <li>Several times during the day, I massage small amounts into my hands and they always feel better!  </li>
      <li>Love all of the ALFA products I have purchased in the past.</li>
      <li>I definately love this creme and works well very good moisturizer, only down is that it smells really bad</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t smart enough to think of this; but my therapist gave me a list of things that MIGHT be beneficial and said to try them.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m now 58 years old</li>
      <li>but this seems to be a good tool to maybe slow it down.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This cream is remarkable.  My skin has improved so much since I have been using it.  This is my second order and my friend also uses it and says the same.  Our skin has taken on a younger look.</li>
    <li> I LIKE HOW IT MAKES THE SKIN FEEL ON YOUR FACE AND I ONLY BEEN USING IT FO 2 DAYS NICE SOFT SKIN GIVE ME A FEW MORE DAYS AND I CAN TELL U MORE..</li>
    <li> I definately love this creme and works well very good moisturizer, only down is that it smells really bad but not too strong and un-bearable.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t see what this product does. I&#x27;ve been using it and still no result. I guess it is not meant for everyone ;(</li>
    <li> This product is good, I have noticed that my ingrown hairs have all but disappeared, and my face is looking better - give it a try!</li>
    <li> Merchandise as described, received in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> This product left a horrible film on my face and could not wear it under make up at all. Did not do as it said it would. I don&#x27;t know what it did, to me nothing. Just wasted money is all!</li>
    <li> I love this cream because it smells sooo nice, doesn&#x27;t break me out (I have super sensitive skin), &amp; it feels like silk on my skin! It&#x27;s wonderful &amp; I&#x27;ll be buying another 2 jars again. I also love that it HAS NO MINERAL OIL in it either! Cuz mineral oil is gross &amp; it sucks!! Love this product!!</li>
    <li> Skin looks and feels great! Love all of the ALFA products I have purchased in the past. Will order again.</li>
    <li> I used it once and I look ten years younger and my wrinkles are gone. Wow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK now for the real review. Its a very good quality cream and does make my skin feel nice. The price is right and I think the combination of collagen and elastin is a good combination. Lets be real. Were all fighting a losing battle as age creeps in but this seems to be a good tool to maybe slow it down.</li>
    <li> Thsi  product it&#x27;s of easy absorption and it does leave your skin nice and soft, do not really know about the properties of the Baba de Caracol, but I do know something about the collagen, The shipping and delivery was very fast.</li>
    <li> I was willing to give this a try after all the good reviews.  I used it after my derma roller since it was supposed to be so good at rejuvenating your skin.  I woke the next day with red blotches all over my face and it almost looked like little blisters on them.  The stuff smells bad.  I would almost say it smells like snails but I don&#x27;t really know what they smell like.  I would say to use it somewhere other than your face until you&#x27;re sure you won&#x27;t have a reaction to it.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product gets 5 stars.  It is a light cream that seems to lightly exfoliate and the Collagen and Elastin put life back into your skin.  Add this with some copper mineral in your diet and I think you will have radiant skin that beats the wrinkles!!</li>
    <li> Yes I will buy this product again and I have bought more will buy even more as long as it is sold to me it does exactly what I&#x27;m looking for in a product and yes I would recommend this product</li>
    <li> It is a really good product, the only thing is the perfume on it, is not that bad... but it seems like a cheap product because the smell.</li>
    <li> I used to enjoy this cream but after using it for some time it started having some really bad smell… So I stopped using it.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It makes my skin feel so smooth!  I recommend to whoever uses lotions for hands or body!</li>
    <li> I have being using this cream for a year now!! I&#x27;m now 58 years old and I don&#x27;t look my age!! I have tried the most expensive creams in the market but this hits the spot, not only is inexpensive but does a very good job by keeping an smooth and moisture my skin (face, hands, feet etc.) Can&#x27;t bit the price!!</li>
    <li> Nada de particular, tiene muy poca baba de caracol por eso es como cualquier otra crema economica. No la comprare de nuevo y es mejor la otra Celton la original.</li>
    <li> I used it for 3days an my face an neck  broke out in a bad rash...will not buy this again</li>
    <li> I use Collagen Elastin every day. And my face look radiant and glows. I love this product and the Price is really good.</li>
    <li> First ingredient: collagen!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I for sure recommend these awesome product. you notice the difference in your face straight away. you wont regret buying it</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  Smell is ok.  I had hand surgery on both hands at the same time and needed something to help with the healing.  I really think this has helped me the way I was hoping it would.  For my use, I have been putting on more than plenty as it is very affordable.  I do this when I don&#x27;t have to do anything else.  After about 15 minutes, I gently pat off the excess.  Leaves my skin nice and soft.  All the working parts in my hands have been disturbed.  As they heal, they want to draw up.  Several times during the day, I massage small amounts into my hands and they always feel better!  I wasn&#x27;t smart enough to think of this; but my therapist gave me a list of things that MIGHT be beneficial and said to try them.  Other things I have found on Amazon which were on that list to try and have, also, been helpful are: Miracle Plus Arnica Bruise Cream, Best Bentonite Clay (Guthrie, Oklahoma - GREAT PRICE).  I didn&#x27;t mention the fact that it feels ever so nice on my face.</li>
    <li> Item was sent from overseas and the altitude must have affected the packaging, because when I opened the box, the cream was everywhere. I opened the tub and the seal was broken and the cream had exploded everywhere. Probably have 1/4 of the product left that can be used.</li>
