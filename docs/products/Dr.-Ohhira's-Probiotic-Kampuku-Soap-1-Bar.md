### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Awesome product!</li>
      <li>What I do know, however, is that Dr. Ophira&#x27;s soap is really awesome.</li>
      <li>This is excellent soap.  </li>
      <li>I was turned onto Dr. Ohhira by my doctor who touted his probiotics as some of the best in the world.</li>
      <li>The product arrived in excellent condition and as promised.</li>
      <li>Very  very good  soap.</li>
      <li>I hear it&#x27;s also great for shaving....</li>
      <li>Works great as a body soap too.</li>
      <li>To be honest, I don&#x27;t understand how the probiotics makes a good soap.</li>
      <li>I love it!  </li>
      <li>Nice soap.</li>
      <li>It is really good at fighting acne and blemishes, leaving you skin nice feeling, clean and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;The scent is very light, if any at all.</li>
      <li>Love this soap</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
      <li>I love this soap.</li>
      <li>Love the lather and the way my face feels after washing</li>
      <li>Also, it has a nice clean scent.</li>
      <li>From the first time I used this soap, I fell in love with it!</li>
      <li>The probiotics in this soap are the cherry on top and have helped reduce body odor, don&#x27;t over dry the skin and acts as an excellent shaving lubricant, better than many of the top rated natural shavings creams on Amazon (I&#x27;ve tried lots).</li>
      <li>Smells fine.  </li>
      <li>We love using Dr. Ohhira&#x27;s Probiotic Kampuku Soap because it is very gentle on the skin, has a pleasant fragrance, and seems to help clear the appearance of our skin.</li>
      <li>Gets you clean without being overly drying to your skin.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s great for my son and my dry skin.  </li>
      <li>It leaves my skin feeling so fresh and clean that I just can&#x27;t wait to wash my face with it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This mild soap comes in a long-lasting bar.  </li>
      <li>so when I saw the ingredient list I knew this was a rare find.</li>
      <li>Keeps you smelling fresh too.  </li>
      <li>I expected that it would leave some good flora on your skin and nourish it, but no probiotics soaps seem to describe this as their approach.</li>
      <li>any case I do highly recommend Dr. Ophira&#x27;s soap, primarily as an acne and complexion bar for your face.</li>
      <li>works fine so far - after using it this month</li>
      <li>And, for me, to obtain that truly natural clean feel that I want, it&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
      <li>It makes your skin feel soft and clean.  </li>
      <li>However, with some natural products, they just don&#x27;t have a real sense of &#x27;clean&#x27; to me.</li>
      <li>I use it for my face and body because it leaves it super soft.  </li>
      <li>It has no scent, and is gentle on the face.  </li>
      <li>I really couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product.</li>
      <li>I have recently purchased other probiotic bars for my body, but they seem to have a very different approach - they mostly have oils like tea tree and eucalyptus that fight skin infection (mostly fungal).</li>
      <li>I prefer &amp;#34;Mountain Ocean Coconut Soap&amp;#34; which costs about 3.50 per bar and contains high quality ingredients (albeit unfermented).</li>
      <li>Love this soap but for the price it doesn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
      <li>All natural.  </li>
      <li>all natural ingredients</li>
      <li>caramel color is toxic even if it&#x27;s from natural sources.</li>
      <li>I have not noticed any major  difference w/ 1st bar.  </li>
      <li>It seems to really strip oil and dirt that other soaps leave, while also leaving your skin moist and protected.</li>
      <li>this is much healthier soap than conventional brands</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m generally not a &amp;#34;bar soap&amp;#34; type person, but when ordering Dr. Ohhira&#x27;s Probiotics, I thought, why not try this soap as I like to keep my beauty products as natural as possible.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love the lather and the way my face feels after washing</li>
    <li> Have been using this for a while now and have been getting compliments on how my skin looks. I like how it makes it feel and not leaving it feeling itchy. Love this soap</li>
    <li> I was turned onto Dr. Ohhira by my doctor who touted his probiotics as some of the best in the world. I&#x27;ve personally always looked for products with minimal and all natural ingredients so when I saw the ingredient list I knew this was a rare find. The probiotics in this soap are the cherry on top and have helped reduce body odor, don&#x27;t over dry the skin and acts as an excellent shaving lubricant, better than many of the top rated natural shavings creams on Amazon (I&#x27;ve tried lots).

    <li> This stuff lasts forever!</li>
    <li> We love using Dr. Ohhira&#x27;s Probiotic Kampuku Soap because it is very gentle on the skin, has a pleasant fragrance, and seems to help clear the appearance of our skin. The product arrived in excellent condition and as promised. We will continue to reorder this product.</li>
    <li> This mild soap comes in a long-lasting bar.  It has no scent, and is gentle on the face.  I hear it&#x27;s also great for shaving....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this soap.  I use it for my face and body because it leaves it super soft.  I had broken out into hives about two months ago and couldn&#x27;t find anything that would calm down my inflamed skin.  So I decided to give this a go and it worked!  It&#x27;s a bit pricey but it has lasted me over a month, and I use it like crazy.  Awesome product!</li>
    <li> I love this soap. There&#x27;s no unnatural perfume smell to it and it&#x27;s great for my son and my dry skin.  Also it helps clear any bad scent you have that&#x27;s coming out of your pores.</li>
    <li> works fine so far - after using it this month I have not noticed any major  difference w/ 1st bar.  We&#x27;ll try the second bar and see from there.. Not sure if &amp;#34;probiotic&amp;#34; matters at this point for facial soap ???  Dermatologist had no input positive or negative when asked about the &amp;#34;probiotic&amp;#34; benefit in soap.</li>
    <li> Love this soap but for the price it doesn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
    <li> To be honest, I don&#x27;t understand how the probiotics makes a good soap. I expected that it would leave some good flora on your skin and nourish it, but no probiotics soaps seem to describe this as their approach. What I do know, however, is that Dr. Ophira&#x27;s soap is really awesome. It seems to really strip oil and dirt that other soaps leave, while also leaving your skin moist and protected. It is really good at fighting acne and blemishes, leaving you skin nice feeling, clean and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my second bar and I reserve this bar for my face. I have recently purchased other probiotic bars for my body, but they seem to have a very different approach - they mostly have oils like tea tree and eucalyptus that fight skin infection (mostly fungal). I don&#x27;t think Ophira&#x27;s does this at all, but I could be wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I any case I do highly recommend Dr. Ophira&#x27;s soap, primarily as an acne and complexion bar for your face.</li>
    <li> Been using this soap for the past 5 years. It&#x27;s the only thing that works on my face. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out, and keeps blemishes away. Works great as a body soap too. Also, it has a nice clean scent. Usually soap fragrances give me headaches, but I&#x27;ve never had a problem here.</li>
    <li> Not worth the $$$$$$$$$$</li>
    <li> This is excellent soap.  Gets you clean without being overly drying to your skin.  Smells fine.  All natural.  Keeps you smelling fresh too.  Can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m generally not a &amp;#34;bar soap&amp;#34; type person, but when ordering Dr. Ohhira&#x27;s Probiotics, I thought, why not try this soap as I like to keep my beauty products as natural as possible. However, with some natural products, they just don&#x27;t have a real sense of &#x27;clean&#x27; to me. From the first time I used this soap, I fell in love with it! It leaves my skin feeling so fresh and clean that I just can&#x27;t wait to wash my face with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is very light, if any at all. The color is an odd caramel color, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted, the bar size is small for the price, but it seems to last a very long time. And, for me, to obtain that truly natural clean feel that I want, it&#x27;s so worth it. If we were to compare the cost of this bar to liquid cleansers that are twice the price, it might balance out.</li>
    <li> The only ingredient I didnt approve of was the caramel color. Not only did it run and discolor my tub ... caramel color is toxic even if it&#x27;s from natural sources. Dont get me wrong ... this is much healthier soap than conventional brands but it&#x27;s not the wisest use of your money. I prefer &amp;#34;Mountain Ocean Coconut Soap&amp;#34; which costs about 3.50 per bar and contains high quality ingredients (albeit unfermented).</li>
    <li> I read previous reviews on the soap, and decided to try it. I love it!  It makes your skin feel soft and clean.  The only downside is the price.</li>
    <li> Very  very good  soap.</li>
    <li> Nice soap. I brought it for the hubby in the hope that it would help with his eczema, but I took it for my face!</li>
