<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> moist &amp; light&lt;br /&gt;lasts for hours&lt;br /&gt;nice fragrance&lt;br /&gt;price is right&lt;br /&gt;wonderful product&lt;br /&gt;very creamy&lt;br /&gt;two pack is great idea</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this product to me last year and I have been purchasing since.  Use to soften and hydrate skin after bath/shower and seems to have helped lessen the appearance of scar; thyroid surgery.</li>
    <li> My mother has been using this creme for a long time. I always wanted to use it as well but never could find it. Now that I can order it on amazon I feel much better! This creme gives your skin a glow and a soft, smooth feel! I love it!</li>
    <li> This is the only lotion I&#x27;ve found that relieves my dry itchy wintery skin.</li>
    <li> Genes Vitamin E Cream Swiss Callagen Complex was recommended by a skin specialist. We had been using a much cheaper over-the-counter vitamin E cream in prior years. This product works very well for some cronic skin conditions, as now other members of our family attest. Though the up-front cost is expensive, a little goes a long way. When it comes health vs cost, health wins. However, you can save a few dollars by buying more than one and getting free shipping as we do with Amazon.com</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT FOR MY WIFE WHO LOVES THE STUFF. IT SEEMS I BOUGHT HER A JAR A WHILE BACK. SHE NEVER SAID MUCH ABOUT IT TILL IT APPARENTLY RAN OUT. SHE ASKED ME WHERE I BOUGHT THAT CREME. SHE REALLY LIKED IT BUT IT HAD RUN OUT AND SHE WANTED TO BUY SOME MORE. WHERE DID I BUY IT SHE ASKED. BUT THAT WAS  QUITE A WHILE AGO AND I REALLY COULD NOT REMEMBER. I CHECKED A COUPLE OF STORES WHERE I FREQUENTLY LOOKED FOR BARGAINS BUT NO LUCK. THEN I HAD AN IDEA.MAYBE I COULD FIND IT ONLINE. WELL IT TURNED UP RIGHT ON ONE OF MY FAVORITE SITES \\&quot;AMAZON\\&quot; I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN I COULD FIND IT THERE. THEY HAVE JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING.{THAT&#x27;S NOT THE PLACE I BOUGHT IT ORIGINALLY, I NEVER DID FIGURE THAT OUT.} THE PRICE WAS RIGHT SO I BOUGHT TWO JARS! MY WIFE IS HAPPY![[ASIN:B0016ZZW7E GENES Vitamin E Swiss Collagen Creme - 16 oz (2 PACK - Total 32 oz)]]</li>
    <li> I use Genes Collagen Creme daily. I have been using it for about a year with good results. I believe it helps to apply after a hot steamy shower. My daughter recommended it to me so it is age and generation friendly. The collagen helps to promote elasticity in the skin and after a weight loss this can be a very valuable asset.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this every morning to soothe his sensitive skin, particularly after shaving.  I use it too, as an excellent moisturizer.  It helps to minimize wrinkles and promotes healing.  We like it so well, that I went online to find it after the first jar ran out and I could not find it on store shelves anywhere.  Best of all, it is INEXPENSIVE!  I have used many pricier facial creams that gave no better results.  We are very satisfied with this product.  It smells nice, too!  The product arrived in a timely manner, as advertised.</li>
    <li> I bought the smaller size \\&quot;Gene&#x27;s Vitamin E Cream\\&quot; recently because I  wanted to try a different moisturizer for my very dry, Sensitive skin.   I saw it in Sam&#x27;s Club and decided to give it a try.  On the first night, I felt a tingling sensation but it felt good.  Same thing the next day.  After the third day I woke up with a red RASH on my face!!  My skin felt warm, tight and itched.  I had to go to the Dermatologist, who gave me an antihistimine and salve.  Since I&#x27;ve gotten older, I&#x27;ve had sensitive skin and have been using Dove soap and Cetaphil cream.  But no matter what I&#x27;ve used, I&#x27;ve NEVER had a facial rash!!  This may be a miracle to people with severe skin problems, but it only caused a big problem for me.    If anyone wants to try this cream, I would advise that you put it on another part of your body before using it on your face.  The doctor told me it&#x27;s best to try it on the inside of your forearm before your face.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the Best- wouldn&#x27;t use anything else on my face, have used it for years!</li>
    <li> Despite the inelegant packaging, this cream is superior to any of the expensive products I have bought in department stores. It melts into the skin and lasts all day. An unbelievably good product.</li>
    <li> This product is great for dry skin. its so rich, creamy... i absolutely love it and what it does to my skin. Creates such a beautiful glow from the Vitamin E. Lather it on to dry, scaly feet or hands then put on some gloves/socks for a few hours or during the night and youll wake up with the softest skin! Its not too greasy like other products (like Nivea) but just as moisturizing, if not more in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years and I love it.  However, my local store no longer stocks it so I ordered from Amazon...very glad to have another option for accessing Genes Creme. DG</li>
    <li> This Stuff WORKS!!!! Brings dry scaly skin back to smooth and plush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this type of product for 6 months as I used up all of my prior one. Finally found it on your site at a good price. Thanks for the prompt service</li>
    <li> I love the product hate the price I paid wish I had gone to Sams Wholesale Club before I made the second purchase I over paid for this product by 4.00 per jar.  On this order one of the top was not on tight so it spilled out - I didn&#x27;t return it because it was part of a 2 pack and I needed it as I was going out of town and wanted to take one with me.  I will not ever order this product on Amazon again.:(</li>
    <li> My mother gave me a jar of this stuff. Its great. The smell is good, its a rich creamy texture and my skin drinks it up. I have sensitive skin and i haven&#x27;t had any problems yet with any reactions or break outs. Im even using it with a dermaroller to try and make my stretch marks less visable. Love love love it.</li>
    <li> Let me tell you, I love this lotion.  I stumbled upon it 2 years ago at a Sam&#x27;s Club, while shopping, and decided to try it based on the ingredient listing.  I was about 2 mths pregnant at the time and looking for a lotion that would preserve my skin throughout pregnancy.  THIS LOTION IS THE ONE!  It not only made my entire body feel soft and smooth, but my husband loved it on his severely dry skin.  Once I realized how great this lotion is, I went back and bought several jars for friends of mine who were also pregnant.  They all agreed that this lotion is the most amazing skin care discovery we have seen in years.  AND, our husbands love the feel and the results and use it as well!    Sad to say, I could no longer find it at my local Sam&#x27;s Club.  So i googled and found it here at Amazon.  Happy to see that someone is still carrying it.  I am on my 2nd pregnancy and rubbing the Gene&#x27;s on daily....and passing it out to my other preggo friends.  And this time, I&#x27;m using it on my face and it works there as well!    A total body and family solution!    I love this product.  Thank you Amazon for continuing to carry this amazing lotion!    Sybil.</li>
    <li> Well, it seems to do the job, it does feel a bit greasy, but atleast it helps me go out without dry skin too visible.</li>
    <li> Great product. Now just got to get my daughter one given she states it reduces her leg pores and smooths out her skin. I find the same thing, however, she is more of  a fan.</li>
    <li> I love this creme.  I am 67 years old and it has really helped my face and neck by tightening it.  It is great for the reat of my body also.</li>
    <li> Wonderful used for a couple of years, healed minor cuts fast. Amazing healing from recent surgery. Scar looks mostly like a wrinkle!</li>
    <li> Makes your skin sooooo soft. Awesome!!</li>
    <li> I use this on all of our family at least once a week. It is super moisture packed which is nice almost any time of the year!</li>
    <li> This is a great creme.  Sure smells good.  And I bought this at Sams Club for $7.24</li>
    <li> I like to try new products, but I keep coming back to this.  I live in a very dry location and when the weather got cold, I noticed some keratosis pilaris (bumps) on the back of my upper arm.  This definitely got rid of it in two days.  I was using oils, and specialty creams from high end stores; nothing was working.  I typically have at least two jars of this product because I hate to run out.  This has significantly improved the random scars that I get on my body.  I&#x27;m Asian, and we get keloid scars and hyper pigmentation easily.  This is one of the only products that work for me.  (InviCible is amazing for scars btw)</li>
    <li> This cream seems to be the best vitamin e-cream I have found.  Its not greasy &amp; a little goes a long way~</li>
    <li> Before anyone buys this product do some savvy research. Go to the company that makes this product&#x27;s website. It is a petroleum company. Get it? Gasoline. This product contains many harmful products that the EPA is considering banning due to the harmful effects including but not limited to the following: has been shown to disrupt the natural occurring hormonal process in women and men.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful creme.  I use it under my makeup everyday and at night.  I also use it on my arms legs and neck.  I have even given some of it away to friends to try.  They are very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. I have extremely dry skin and GENES is the only product that will keep my skin moisturizer. Sam&#x27;s club carried this in the past but not anymore.</li>
    <li> I consider myself and educated consumer and rarely get coerced by a name.  However, I stumbled on this by accident.  My mom is a huge fan of collagen products so I decided to give this a try.  I figure with I being 37 and a mom for the second time around, it wouldn&#x27;t hurt.  I could get rid of my stretch marks and maintain my skin as I always do.  I love good skin and one is never too young to start with antiaging regimens.  Well after using this for a few days I noticed my skin improved in terms of elasticity.  It was supple and the vitamin E is slowly addressing my stretch marks.  My mom loves it.    You really get what you pay for with this product.  I would buy this even if the price increased.</li>
    <li> Best creme I have ever used for moisturizing and keeping skin looking young! I use it on arms, elbows, and legs. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> Found this at Sam&#x27;s Club and didn&#x27;t realize how good a job it was doing with my stretch marks until I got pregnant again.  The marks are becoming purple again as my skin is filling out again.  But when I use this stuff they seem to almost disappear.  I kept switching lotions figuring if I switch it up enough something is bound to work.  But I think I am going to stick with this in addition to my Olay 7 Effects.</li>
    <li> This cream is wonderful</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
    <li> Baught two 2packs of this product -total 4 jars-as a gift As I enjoyed this very much myself.I am planning to bring 6 of these for a trip to South Korea.I was totally upset with how they were packed.Each of  two jars were kind of boxtaped( ?)with each other. Some of  labels on the jar came off Because  of the tape that was used.One pack was stilled taped together&lt;br /&gt; and the other pack was taped originally,but it seemed that they were cut open&lt;br /&gt;In the middle.Also these different two pack of jars weighed very differently which I do not understand at all. One is much heavier!Are they using different material for the jars themselves?For my third order I had to cancel the 2pack order.instead I ordered two individual jars by paying more money so I get them in the perfect shape!This is totally ridiculous!I would like to return the original products and get new ones  .After this review I will check to see if this can be done. I hope that the shipper contact me!</li>
    <li> This is a very heavy cream that will be sure to moisturize dry skin. Not good for facial use, will clog facial pores. Good as a body cream only. Has a strong scent, so use nightly because if you use daytime, it will clash with perfume/cologne. I gave 4 stars because the seller did not pack it well and 1 out of the 2 containers arrived cracked and leaking. And also because the scent is a bit overpowering. I recommend you purchase and send a note to seller to pack properly.</li>
    <li> I started using GENES, after a double mastectomy, on the advice of my plastic surgeon. The results were remarkable.  I scar easily, but I healed beautifully using this lotion.  I have never looked back.  My sensitive skin soaks this lotion up.  It leaves my skin soft and supple.  I recommend it to everyone I know.  I even give it as a post surgery gift to close friends.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream on my face for about 10 years now and people are always asking me what cream I use because I do not have any wrinkles. They also guess me at least 10 years younger than I am. (I am in my mid forties) You would normally pay a lot more for a cream with Vitaumin E and one that helps to replenish the collagen in your skin. You cannot go wrong with this cream because before I started using this, I used to spend nearly $100 on my face cream and my face was a lot dryer looking than it is now.</li>
    <li> I just started using the product. It&#x27;s a good cream for my super dry skin. I&#x27;m not sure if the collagen will do much on my skin. But it definitely doesn&#x27;t do any harm. I have very dry and sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve been searching for a good cream for my skin. And this cream is one of the better cream I&#x27;ve used. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> Arrived in a timely manner and met my expectations.</li>
    <li> Wife loves this stuff. Skin has never been so soft. Prevented stretching during pregnancy and no dry skin during weather changes.</li>
    <li> My sister recommended this body cream to me several years ago, and I&#x27;m forever grateful she did.  I live in the southwestern part of the U.S., so keeping moisturized is a must.  It&#x27;s great as a general conditioner for parched skin, but it also does wonders on dry, cracked heels.  It&#x27;s not greasy, but it does take several minutes to really soak in.  My one complaint is very minor......it only comes in this one size. That means I travel with the big jar or scoop a great amount over into a smaller container. I can deal with that.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I found this creme at Walmart when I became pregnant with my first child.  I tried it because I was not impressed with those other cremes and lotions that were supposed to be good for the stretching belly.  I LOVE it!  Not one stretchmark and my skin was soft and supple the entire time!  Used it all through my 2nd pregnancy and the same results.  I have extremely sensitive skin on my face, so I never have put it on my face since it&#x27;s very thick, but I use it everywhere else.  I&#x27;m so glad I found it!  This stuff is the best!!</li>
    <li> This product makes my skin so soft and glowing.  I use it day and night. During the hottest part of summer it is a little heavy to use int the daytime.</li>
    <li> I first bought at Sam&#x27;s club because it was cheap but it is the best crème for dry skin.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I love this cream! It&#x27;s thick, creamy...and works so well! I use it all over, especially right out of the shower. I also send some home with my 4 yr old granddaughter who has eczema. It&#x27;s soothing, doesn&#x27;t sting, and it really helps heal her &amp;#34;owies.&amp;#34; I ordered the 2-pack, and I am so glad I did!</li>
    <li> I will for certainl buy this product again.  And I loved being able to buy the 16 oz. 2 pack.</li>
    <li> Best quality facial &amp; body creme for your money!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin, have to use clinic makeup.  I&#x27;m very careful want product I put on my face.  This creme keeps my face smooth and youthful.  No wrinkles and I&#x27;m buying this creme for both face &amp; body.  Love the quality of this creme,  priced very reasonable.</li>
    <li> This crème is exceptional and works marvelously.  It also has a nice scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering.  A little goes a long way so it is a great value for your money.</li>
    <li> Wonderful moisturizer cream very wonderful</li>
    <li> My friend recommended this when I was pregnant to rub in my itchy belly. I still use it. It&#x27;s think and it hydrated my dry nurse hands. I just lube them up before bed.</li>
    <li> Wuderfull creme, love it and my skin too :-)</li>
    <li> best lotion ,cream ever. Not greasy!!! Doesn&#x27;t break out face.  I use it to remove make up every night and coven myself from head to toe after almost every shower. Great for after a day in the sun as well.  Keeps skin soft and well moisturized. I put small amounts in smaller containers for purse, car, office, etc.and have a tub in every bathroom.</li>
    <li> Used this creme for 8 years and the only creme that consistently works in the dry desert climate of Scottsdale, AZ!  Love It!</li>
    <li> I really love the Gene&#x27;s creme.. I bought it on a nurse&#x27;s recommendation to prevent cold weather cuts on my hands.. I don&#x27;t know it it will prevent them on my hands next winter.. But, i am hopeful that it will help.. It has a great feel on my skin and makes it feel soft.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend anyone try it who has delicate skin like me.</li>
    <li> like the cream but when I read all the parabens in it  (lots of parabens!)  I stopped using it..  Now is they took out the parabens I might use it again.</li>
    <li> JUST BUY IT! Had chest reduction surgery (male) and skin was all wrinkled. This stuff works...in a week, skin is much smoother. Not hype but results.</li>
    <li> I love this cream.  My skin looks and feels great. I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> The product was recommended by a family member who has raved about the results. Being diagnosed with disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis (DSAP) by my dermatologist.  I know there are limited products that help. But \\&quot;Genes Vitamin E Swiss Collagen Creme\\&quot; has helped in fading scars and sunspots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend for softer skin.</li>
    <li> I was delighted to receive this product from my daughter.  It is creamy, long-lasting, and leaves your skin very smooth and Non-oily.  I use it at night, am, and after the pool.  I have sent it to friends, and they enjoy it, too.  The fragrence is very light.  Should be great for anyone.  I am a convinced customer.   Perfect for skin care    Joan Thielmann</li>
    <li> Fast international shipping at reasonable charges. I&#x27;ve been using this product for some years, and was glad to find out that I could order the product internationally. Great price,too.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, I always buy it and recommend to my friends. I wish the price would be reduced.. It is thick the way I like my body creams, love the smell and the jar is big enough for it to last me ( I use it on my entire body every single day).</li>
    <li> I have been using for several years now &amp; I love this product.  I have even had massages with it.  Wonderful!</li>
    <li> is your just perfect for dry skin we use in home because help to soft skin this product I new to me my first time I used was because my sister gave as gift.</li>
    <li> I am 65 and my skin has become dry and thin. This product seems to make my skin thicker and baby soft. I use it almost every night after a shower.</li>
    <li> This is the very best product I&#x27;ve ever purchased online. It&#x27;ll turn your skin baby soft and will make stretch marks smoother.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a license skin therapist and have been using this for almost a year. I can not believe how much my skin has improved and kept a healthy glow. This cream is my go to and I will never be without it! I can&#x27;t even explain the amount I love I have for it!</li>
    <li> Excellent moisturizer. Great for reducing fine lines, scars, acne scars, etc. My favorite beauty product ever. Would highly recommend. I use it every day.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I have never had my skin be this smooth and feel this great.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for over 15 years.  It is the best.  I wouldn&#x27;t consider using any other cream.&lt;br /&gt;NK&lt;br /&gt;Massachusetts</li>
    <li> This is your Holy Grail, best ever moisterizer base.  Add oils and butter to enhance, protect, etc., but you need to buy this.</li>
    <li> my skin after an operation, needed this product.  so good, i use it on my feet  and hands. thanks alot</li>
    <li> I cannot use any other cream. This is hands down the best cream there is. I remember falling off the back of a friend&#x27;s motorcycle in Cambodia and scratching up my face. I used this cream on my wounds before I bandaged them and in one week, my skin healed completely. I&#x27;ve been using this cream for years and I do not recommend anything else. It&#x27;s an amazing product.</li>
    <li> This creme is a definite must. Living in the cold NorthEast, this product is great for winter use. Hydrates and lasts for hours. Gave the other container to a friend and she swears by it. I found the product originally at Sam&#x27;s Club in Texas.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift. They loved it.</li>
    <li> It is especially wonderful for anyone with dry skin. Non-greasy so don&#x27;t worry about getting it on your clothing after application.</li>
    <li> My hands get very dry and skin on fingers crackes in the winter. This Gene&#x27;s Vit. E Cream was recommended and it really helped. I put it on my hands at bedtime and wear cotton gloves so by morning my hands are healed and they feel good again.</li>
    <li> Works well. It&#x27;s a bit thick for my taste but does its job very well. It&#x27;s stays a little greasy for a while but I guess that protects the face. It smells like putty a bit too but that goes away quickly.</li>
    <li> I use this for my neck. It is not that sticky, but smooth. Price is very good for the size.</li>
    <li> Been using this for years. Use it on my legs and arms, too.</li>
    <li> This cream is amazing it does so much I use it all over my body my skin is so soft and beautiful this is a must have.. Try it you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice this cream contains parabens.  Too bad--causes cancer.  Otherwise, nice light cream, if only they could remove these components.</li>
    <li> I love Genes Vitamin E Swiss Collagen Crème. It works ! I use it as a face crème &amp; a body crème. I am never without it. V</li>
    <li> Awesome, works excellent on the skin. After the first use i was impressed and can see and feel the difference.</li>
    <li> I have used this cream for several years.  I am 70 years old and I&#x27;ve tried all the supposed miracle creams that cost so much money.  This cream is great for all over body moisturizing, even my face.  It keeps my skin soft and and helps with wrinkles as well.  Bought it first at Sam&#x27;s Club, but found it here at a better price.  One jar lasts a long time, but I bought two because the price was right.  I never want to run out.</li>
    <li> Havent noticed any difference</li>
    <li> This product used to be @ Sam&#x27;s club but they&#x27;ve since stopped carrying this product, why they stopped I&#x27;ll never know. This product is a cure-all for pretty much every skin condition: dryness, rough elbows &amp; knees, calluses, eczema, psoriasis, keratosis pilaris, you name it, genes will take care of it. Genes is better than any other lotion/ creme I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, feels good but is greasy and takes awhile to sink in.  Not something you would want to use at night before going to bed but in the morning when it has time to sink in before bed so you don&#x27;t get the stuff all over your pillow case and in your hair.  Does feel good and face is soft and smooth too so good product for that purpose.  Would buy again.  Especially good for feet and if you wear socks you don&#x27;t have to worry about the greasiness and my feet are sooooo very soft and feel great and look great too.</li>
    <li> A very rich cream, I use as body Cream</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing!  Love it on the face, arms and legs.  I am very sensitive to most Revlon products&lt;br /&gt;and Estee Lauder and I use Clinque,due to no perfumes, but found this moisturizer the best.  No sensitivity!&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t beat the price too!  I originally received this recommendation from a friend who uses it and her&lt;br /&gt;facial skin is flawless.</li>
    <li> This Vitiamin E creme is the best! First saw it at Costco on demo day, was reasonably priced and made my hands look &amp; feel so good. The jar lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> This is the best skin care creme ever made. My husband and I both use it every day so I bought the twin pack.  I goes a long way but since both of us use this, I did not want to run out.</li>
    <li> i was going to make some uber lotion using this but after i tried it by itself, it really was all that and a bag of chips. If you need a lotion that moisturizes without using an emollient - try this. I love using it before bed, i feel like my hands benefit from it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! So thick and creamy, perfect for my dry cracked skin in the winter. Smells nice too. Use it on my whole body and don&#x27;t have to worry about the winter dryness in Colorado anymore.</li>
    <li> This product definitely keeps winter dryness at bay.  Even if I miss one day, I can feel the results of this cream.</li>
    <li> I love this product, I have been using it since years on my face and body during the cold winter months and I can just recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product at Sam&#x27;s club about 16 years ago. I am 65 years old, have used it as a night cream, and as a moisturizer under my makeup. Everyone including my doctor asks me what I use on my skin. I highly recommend it to every woman, at least give it a try, you might be surprised.</li>
    <li> Great ingredients and great quality, worth the money!</li>
    <li> Two huge tubs for so cheap!  I use it as a belly cream for my expanding preggo belly.  I think it smells really nice, very light unoffensive scent.  I use it on dry heels as well.  The only thing I could say about it is that it takes a bit to absorb into your skin, so you can be slightly sticky for a bit,  but it&#x27;s only because the cream is so thick.  You only need a quarter sized amount for my whole belly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: 7 months pregnant now and still not a single stretch mark!  Not sure if it&#x27;s the cream or just luck, but this stuff is awesome</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and was unable to purchase it locally.  It&#x27;s a wonderful moisturizer for legs!</li>
    <li> loved the cream.....I gave some to my daughter.  I have told my friends about the cream and how great it is.</li>
    <li> This is the best body lotion ever.&lt;br /&gt;Not a single stretch mark during pregnancy because of this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Dams club has it for $9.</li>
    <li> Great product my skin is very sensitive so this is  the only creme i used on my face</li>
    <li> I love the consistency of this cream and the price was reasonable.  I use it on face, neck and body.  I would definitely order again and see what other products this company has to offer.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Have gotten my mother and daughters hooked on it.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing on my 50 years young body skin. I use it after shower on my legs and elbows mostly and it does miracles! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This cream is very thick and really works well for the dryer areas of the body. I have only been using it off and on for two weeks so I feel reviewing this cream is premature but so far so good. I will update this review after a few months. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Really like this skin cream</li>
    <li> This creme is amazing. I went looking for a vitamin E creme to treat a surgical scar as recommended by my physical therapist. I am also using it on my forearms.  That skin was starting to look like &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; skin.  With the collagen in this creme, after just a couple of weeks, I&#x27;m seeing much firmer skin. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great!  This is my second order. I use it daily on my entire body as a moisturizer. It is great on dry skin.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin. This is my go-to cream throughout the year. It moisturizes well without sitting on the skin and feeling heavy. It also gives the skin a nice glow.</li>
    <li> The jar is BIG and that really made me worried about how to use all of it, especially my skin is very sensitive. But now I am not worried at all. I am using it as basic facial cream, hand cream, body lotion and even massage oil. It felt a little thick and sticky when I just put it on but it would be all absorbed by the skin. Like the natural scent too.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, the smell is not over powering and the feel is not greasy</li>
    <li> My husband &amp; I tried one container of Genes Vitamin E Creme just to see if we liked it. I prefer to apply it as a body lotion esp. after shaving my legs.  My husband has been using it on his face with great results. His skin is smoother &amp; looks younger than it has in years. Dry skin is a legacy of months spent in Arizona &amp; currently New Mexico. The lotion is a little thick when applied to the body but clears up in a matter of minutes. Today I purchased two more containers while at Sam&#x27;s club.  For the price it&#x27;s worth more than all the expensive creams &amp; lotions I have purchased in the past.</li>
    <li> this is a good product, I have used it several years an would recommend it to anyone. will order again for sure.</li>
    <li> I tried this cr&amp;egrave;me at a friend&#x27;s house and loved it, so I decided to purchase some for myself.  I use it every day and it lasts until I take a shower.  My skin appears younger looking.  I recommend this to men and women who have dry skin during the winter months or all year round.  Definitely a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Actual Performance of cream is higher than normal global brand ones. Poor point is quality of assembling caps and printing.</li>
    <li> love the stuff . my hands get really chapped working w/ food,  washing dogs,and walking outside in cold weather.  I would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> Omg! I have been looking for a great moisturizing lotion for years, and now I have found it! It makes my skin feel soft and supple! This is the best lotion ever for dry skin!</li>
    <li> Best Vitamin E Collagen Cream on the market for the money. Keeps your Skin looking healthy and young. Try it and you will love it.</li>
    <li> Great cream. I have always loved this stuff. I use it to make some special cream that my friends and family love. I cannot find it locally so I order from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love this cream, it is really the best product I have ever used for dry skin and it it really good if you have dry feet. I have seen a great improvement after using it 3 nights. I will continue ordering this cream. I want to share it with others so I plan to give a few jar for Christmas presents. This cream is above 5 stars.</li>
    <li> use this stuff daily and love it.</li>
    <li> My mom heard great things about this lotion and I bought it for her. She likes it, so I will probably keep buying it.</li>
    <li> Love the Genes Vitamin E Swiss Collagen Creme&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is the best stuff going.  I always recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> http://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/productsingredients/ingredients/ucm128042.htm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are concerned about parabens.</li>
    <li> best lotion ever, i use every day</li>
    <li> Lotion is amazing! My skin glows everyday!</li>
    <li> I have to stock up, as when friends come over they want to take a jar home.</li>
    <li> I use this making my own homemade hand cream.  It is exactly what I need.</li>
    <li> Have used this product previously and like it very much.  Think it does help my face.  Am 70 and people tell me I don&#x27;t look 70.</li>
    <li> Been using this cream for about 6 yrs now --&amp;#34;I LOVE IT &amp;#34; . Try it you will love it as I do . My Mother and Grandmother but use it also .</li>
    <li> Got this from my great aunt and now it&#x27;s the only thing I use. Super emollient cream for the face (at night) and whole body!</li>
    <li> Caution is advised on this product. It is a nice thick cream purchased to fight extremely dry &amp;#34;chemo skin&amp;#34;, and I expected good results from it. I discovered I have a terrible skin reaction to it. I broke out in red welts all over the treated areas, and now continue to have significant burning and  itching even after bathing. I do have allergies to some plants so probably reacted to one of the unspecified generic &amp;#34;plant material&amp;#34; contents.</li>
    <li> It is delicious on my face and the rest of me.</li>
    <li> Discovered this by accident at a big box store SALE BIN.  When I tried to buy it again it wasn&#x27;t available.  Went immediately to Amazon. Now I purchase it in 2 packs, in case I need to gift one to a friend. I apply it all over, yes including my face, after each bath, shower, or face wash. It&#x27;s \\&quot;free\\&quot; of everything I&#x27;m sensitive to, including scents...BUT my biggest draw is that it absorbs quickly (even tho&#x27; I wet apply), you can slather and dress immediately... and it does make a difference in my dry skin, winkles &amp; scars.  TRULY, even my husband notices and has started using it on his legs!  If I had 1 improvement it would contain sunscreen of some sort.  Even tho&#x27; I&#x27;m an outdoor person, I&#x27;m almost willing to stay in (not really)because the product is so good.  I just apply a SPF 30-45 over exposed areas and trek on.  Even when I perspire so as to drip into my eyes (w/o the sunscreen) I have no stinging, itching or burning.  Boy, I should get paid for this RAVE, but it&#x27;s true.  Please, manufacturer (on 2nd thought) do not change any thing you&#x27;re doing!</li>
    <li> It was perfect thank u so much</li>
    <li> Thank you thank you...one of my favorite creams..need to order more because a jar was taken from me lol..overall very satisfied</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer I ever tried!!&lt;br /&gt;Great price!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff, uses it all the time.  Really helps on sun burns.</li>
    <li> GREAT FOR MY SKIN I LOVE THIS SKIN CARE</li>
    <li> So glad to have found this product again.  I had first purchased the cream at a wholesale store. They did not have it when I ran out.  It is a wonderful product, especially for people with sensitive skin, like  me.</li>
    <li> This is the only cream WE use!!!</li>
    <li> I find that this creme is great on rough and itchy skin.  My husband and I both use it.  My only problem was with the shipping.  One of the two jars was partially opened in shipping and I lost some of it (a good portion ended on and ruined a book that I had also ordered).  That had to be re-ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus, the product is great, but the shipping leaves something to be desired.</li>
    <li> After reading so any review I decided to try it. But I found that my skin is still dry, lotion is thick and not creamy at all and rushing every morning to get ready I had to take my time to really rub this lotion in so that it absorbs in my skin. Bummer bcz I got 2 pack and its going to take forever to finish or it will just sit on my shelf now.</li>
    <li> i HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR ABOUT 3 YEARS. i HAD NO IDEA IT COULD BE ORDERED ONLINE, BUT I KNEW IF IT COULD, AMAZON WOULD HAVE IT,</li>
</ol>
