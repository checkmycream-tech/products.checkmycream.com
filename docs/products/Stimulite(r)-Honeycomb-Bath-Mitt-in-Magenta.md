      <li>This is great after a day in the pool with sunscreen and chlorine and</li>
      <li>Great quality bath mitt.  </li>
      <li>but eventually it smooths out but still is great.</li>
      <li>a good scrub is needed.</li>
      <li>every one loved it.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>More function versus form!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing</li>
      <li>My skin feels amazing even my husband uses it.</li>
      <li>Love, love, love this!</li>
      <li>love using this product.</li>
      <li>I also love that they&#x27;re made in the USA and recyclable.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I love these honeycomb products.</li>
      <li>My favorite bath mit.</li>
      <li>She thinks it&#x27;s a bit rough for her skin, but I find it perfect, wouldn&#x27;t change a thing.</li>
      <li>Using this with a great body wash makes my skin feel young again.  </li>
      <li>Ive used mine for 2 years and it is still going strong.</li>
      <li>The Stimulite® Honeycomb Bath Mitt is such a great exfoliator.</li>
      <li>These are good for the occasional scrub-down when you&#x27;re an experienced user and no they do not really soften up until you&#x27;ve used them for years.  </li>
      <li>also&lt;br /&gt;air dries quickly after use.</li>
      <li>The stimulite is stiff and great for exfoliating.</li>
      <li>They are very stiff and could scratch you if not used with great care.  </li>
      <li>So if you&#x27;re thinking of investing for the first time, you will be better served with the blue mitts.  </li>
      <li>I love my blue one.</li>
      <li>I first saw this years ago in a catalog, but did not purchase because I could not understand how it could be all they say.</li>
      <li>Instant love.  </li>
      <li>-- it&#x27;s so much quicker and easier</li>
      <li>but they may be too intense for you also.</li>
      <li>suds up nicely with a small amount</li>
      <li>While I love these, they aren&#x27;t for daily use like the blue ones are.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I use it everyday and absolutely LOVE it.</li>
      <li>This information should clearly be stated in the title of this ad!</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll get months of usage, as a matter of fact I purchased this one to replace my 1 1/2 year old mitt that my wife purchased for me.</li>
      <li>If a soft feel is what you are looking for, avoid this one.</li>
      <li>have been a daily hard-core exfoliator since high school.</li>
      <li>Will never go back to a normal exfoliating mitt again.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re just a little too rough, otherwise I love them (I use two).</li>
      <li>No regrets!</li>
      <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased the hot pink ones though and they are MUCH firmer than the blue ones I&#x27;ve always purchased in the past.  </li>
      <li>The first few times you use them, it is a little rough and probably exfoliates more</li>
      <li>I would never use the hot pink on my face and am very careful when using these at all.  </li>

    <li> The mitt is very rough.  Not at all like previous mitts I have bought</li>
    <li> I bought this to take with me on a trip. I have the blue one at home. I love my blue one. When I purchased  this I did not see the description part that says it is for a firmer feel, when I checked the website, I eventually found where it gave that information. I was really disappointed at how rough and hard this one was! It actually scratches!  I checked the package and it says firmer texture! This information should clearly be stated in the title of this ad! I thought I was just buying a different color, not a different texture.</li>
    <li> love using this product.</li>
    <li> Will never go back to a normal exfoliating mitt again. The best!</li>
    <li> I first saw this years ago in a catalog, but did not purchase because I could not understand how it could be all they say. Well in February while visiting my daughter for her birthday and going to a spa I saw the product they had a sample out, I felt it and will never bath with anything else! It&#x27;s amazing I tell everyone about this mitt</li>
    <li> Best thing ever for my arms.  I have older skin that has lots of bumps and is uneven.  Using this with a great body wash makes my skin feel young again.  Love it!</li>
    <li> We have been using these for several years. It&#x27;s an annual gift to my kids, which they request. The first few times you use them, it is a little rough and probably exfoliates more but eventually it smooths out but still is great. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Best exfoliating glove on the market. You&#x27;ll get months of usage, as a matter of fact I purchased this one to replace my 1 1/2 year old mitt that my wife purchased for me. She thinks it&#x27;s a bit rough for her skin, but I find it perfect, wouldn&#x27;t change a thing.</li>
    <li> These are rougher texture bathmitts. My other bathmitts by the same company started falling apart after about 3 years and I bought the rougher ones with the hope that they would last longer. They&#x27;re just a little too rough, otherwise I love them (I use two). I also love that they&#x27;re made in the USA and recyclable.</li>
    <li> excellent producuct. this is a gift for a friend. Ive used mine for 2 years and it is still going strong. and I have tried every mit.</li>
    <li> These Supracor mitts are wonderful and I&#x27;ve been using them for years.  They last for years too. This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased the hot pink ones though and they are MUCH firmer than the blue ones I&#x27;ve always purchased in the past.  While I love these, they aren&#x27;t for daily use like the blue ones are.  These are good for the occasional scrub-down when you&#x27;re an experienced user and no they do not really soften up until you&#x27;ve used them for years.

They are very stiff and could scratch you if not used with great care.  If you have sensitive or delicate skin, do not go with these, buy instead the blue Supracor mitts but they may be too intense for you also.</li>
    <li> My favorite bath mit.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this! Its a bit rougher than the blue one but not scratchy. I use it everyday and absolutely LOVE it.</li>
    <li> I love these honeycomb products. I will never need to buy a salt scrub again. My skin feels amazing even my husband uses it. I bought these as gifts and every one loved it.</li>
    <li> These things are outrageously expensive but they work well and last about 6 months with daily use in the shower.</li>
    <li> Beats the price of a clairsonic any day. Easier clean up and much less expensive to replace if ever needed. The stimulite is stiff and great for exfoliating. It may be too stiff for some but one could wash with lighter pressure. If a soft feel is what you are looking for, avoid this one. I purchased both not sure what I would get. This is great after a day in the pool with sunscreen and chlorine and a good scrub is needed. I like both and give both 5 stars but they are two entirely different feels regarding their stiffness.  Buy accordingly.</li>
    <li> The Stimulite® Honeycomb Bath Mitt is such a great exfoliator. Love it. It drips completely dry after your shower! No problem with odors or having to sanitize it after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I&#x27;d change is its shape. Instead of a &amp;#34;mitt&amp;#34; I&#x27;d manufacture these to be a square or oblong shape that you can use like a face towel. People have different sized hands. My hands are very small, so the fit is wrong. More function versus form!</li>
    <li> Not as soft as I expected</li>
    <li> Great quality bath mitt.  suds up nicely with a small amount&lt;br /&gt;of soap.  Is a firm scrub mitt without being too abrasive. It also&lt;br /&gt;air dries quickly after use.</li>
    <li> I did not realize that the pink mitt is very stiff and harsh. I am unable to use it.</li>
    <li> Oh. Yeah. Baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been a daily hard-core exfoliator since high school. Now, 25 years and 300+ pairs of exfoliating gloves later, I have discovered Stimulite.  Hello, Baby!!!!!  I purchased this pink mitt (because Bring. It. On!!!), and the facial finger-tip one.  Instant love.  This mitt is ROUGH - if you aren&#x27;t used to aggressive exfoliation, definitely buy one of the other colors.  This will leave you smoother than a newborn, and totally exhilarated!  It also does a seriously impressive job of foaming up your bath wash - I only need half the amount I used to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now - the one thing I don&#x27;t care for, is the mitt shape.  I would prefer just a wash-cloth -- it&#x27;s so much quicker and easier that putting the mitt on, taking it off and them putting it on the other hand.  Plus, it&#x27;s a really large mitt, so wearing it is really awkward for me.  I don&#x27;t do that - I just use it like it&#x27;s a wash-cloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit reluctant to spend this much on a bath mitt, but I have no doubt this will last at least a year - between the longevity and cutting my use of bath wash in half, it&#x27;ll pay for itself in a few months.  No regrets!</li>
