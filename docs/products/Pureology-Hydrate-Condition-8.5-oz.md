      <li>Love all Pureology!-worth the money</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve ordered it several times, and the price is good, the delivery prompt, and the results always good.</li>
      <li>I could tell a difference within a week that my hair was becoming healthier.</li>
      <li>OK so at first glance you are going to cringe at the price - we all do.</li>
      <li>I was please with the smell(minty and pleasant) and it conditioned my hair well enough.</li>
      <li>Why mess with a good thing!</li>
      <li>which was a good thing.... a new decent product</li>
      <li>Delivered quickly</li>
      <li>However after hearing so many good things about it, I got the small (sample size) and tried it.</li>

      <li>Can be used without shampoo on really dry hair, effective as a shampoo &amp; condioner in one.</li>
      <li>I love how soft and shiny my hair looks after using this and my color stays vibrant for weeks after a color treatment.</li>
      <li>Moisturizes nicely without weighing down hair</li>
      <li>what I love about it, is that its safe to put on your scalp, not like other conditioners that clog up your pores, this thing works instantly and you feel it as soon as you put it on.</li>
      <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like (aside from the price) is that the smell is so strong that it makes me cough.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always loved pureology and go back and forth between them and trying other brands just to see if they have it right.</li>
      <li>I dind&#x27;t have to use much...</li>
      <li>Using too much is just wasting it.  </li>
      <li>This product works very well</li>
      <li>I have always stayed away from this product as I don&#x60;t really like minty smells.</li>
      <li>I have long, blonde hair, and this is responsible for keeping it healthy.</li>
      <li>I recommend this product highly.</li>
      <li>have long, medium thickness, hair kind of on the finer side, I dye it twice a year, use heat 2-3 times a week, and wash every other day to every 2 days.</li>
      <li>and that was strange first,</li>
      <li>It leaves your hair extremely soft.</li>
      <li>This bottle can last a long time, making the price worth it.</li>
      <li>Love this, it will be hard to even think of going back to non salon conditioners...</li>
      <li>Its worth the price, and its also important to remember that you really only have to use a small dab every other day to make it work.</li>
      <li>Seriously, sooo much moisture, without weighing my very fine hair down.</li>
      <li>I went really dark and back to blonde which cause my hair to break constantly and become very stretchy and spongy feeling.</li>
      <li>I have always had probably with my hair getting dry and feeling stale between blow drying and having it professionally dyed, yet Pureology helped me FINALLY get my healthy hair back.</li>

    <li> This conditioner is awesome and you really see the difference it makes!  Just remember...wet well because alittle goes a long way!  Using too much is just wasting it.  Bottle lasts a very long time.</li>
    <li> wife says she loves it</li>
    <li> Has this fresh feeling to it. I&#x27;ve always loved pureology and go back and forth between them and trying other brands just to see if they have it right. Why mess with a good thing!</li>
    <li> I love the pureology brand.  The shampoo and conditioner leave my hair silky and shiney.  I would recommend this brand to everyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of hair conditioners/detanglers, and this one is the best for me. I&#x27;ve ordered it several times, and the price is good, the delivery prompt, and the results always good.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product at the Garden State Plaza salon for about 24 dollors. The bottle is small for the cost, however I liked the way the prodcut went on my hair and it gave me nice slip. I am learning about co-washing and I have been trying out various conditioners. I didn&#x27;t leave it on very long I becasue my scalp started to tingle(this felt good). I was please with the smell(minty and pleasant) and it conditioned my hair well enough. I dind&#x27;t have to use much...which was a good thing.... a new decent product</li>
    <li> Makes me hair so much more manageable, grows faster, is shinier, smells amazing, makes my scalp feel refreshed, softens without weighing down, it&#x27;s everything I could want. Love this, it will be hard to even think of going back to non salon conditioners...Everybody could buy this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long, medium thickness, hair kind of on the finer side, I dye it twice a year, use heat 2-3 times a week, and wash every other day to every 2 days. I get a lot of compliments on the shine, body, and smell of my hair.</li>
    <li> This product works very well and I use with with their hydrating shampoo.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like (aside from the price) is that the smell is so strong that it makes me cough.</li>
    <li> what a difference you can feel RIGHT AWAY... what I love about it, is that its safe to put on your scalp, not like other conditioners that clog up your pores, this thing works instantly and you feel it as soon as you put it on. and both my hair stylists use this so I know its good stuff</li>
    <li> This conditioner saved my hair! I went really dark and back to blonde which cause my hair to break constantly and become very stretchy and spongy feeling. I could tell a difference within a week that my hair was becoming healthier. I definitely recommend it for anyone who colors their hair or has damaged hair.</li>
    <li> OK so at first glance you are going to cringe at the price - we all do. Yet I can sincerely say this has made a difference with my hair. I have always had probably with my hair getting dry and feeling stale between blow drying and having it professionally dyed, yet Pureology helped me FINALLY get my healthy hair back. Its worth the price, and its also important to remember that you really only have to use a small dab every other day to make it work. This bottle can last a long time, making the price worth it.</li>
    <li> Worth every penny. Makes my hair feel like it does when it has been blown out at the salon. With other conditioners, my hair isn&#x27;t as lightweight and manageable.</li>
    <li> OMG, I have been trying and trying different conditioners for dry hair for years. I have always stayed away from this product as I don&#x60;t really like minty smells. However after hearing so many good things about it, I got the small (sample size) and tried it. I couldn&#x60;t believe how this product INSTANTY helped my hair!!! Seriously, sooo much moisture, without weighing my very fine hair down. The mint smell yes was shocking and it does stimulates your scalp and that was strange first, but now I have the big bottles and I am kinda used to all that. The results are fantastic and ths is my all time favorite moisturizing conditioner!!!&lt;br /&gt;(Also, for shampoo, I got the Pureology Perfect4Platinum shampoo, and together they work like a dream!) :-))) 10 stars, I hope they never discontiue these products or change them...</li>
