      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found these on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They are easy to use &amp; I like the look even better than when my hair is up.  </li>
      <li>I use with caution because they feel like they&#x27;ll break easily.  </li>
      <li>It makes it way easy to close it doing it that way.</li>
      <li>May not be the prettiest most decorative, although they hold your hair back great.  </li>
      <li>The secure mechanism holds together even better than the original set.</li>
      <li>If they had a tighter grip it might be fine.</li>
      <li>Light and easy to manage with my curls.  </li>
      <li>I tried to get all of my hair into this, and the clip a. wouldn&#x27;t fit all of my hair between the combs and b.</li>
      <li>These are the same that I used to buy over a decade ago, I was so happy to find them again</li>
      <li>So far so good, so we shall see.</li>
      <li>These are the ORIGINAL banana clip by GOODY.</li>
      <li>These long banana combs are great.  </li>
      <li>Just love these and highly recommend them!</li>
      <li>My hair is full and curly</li>
      <li>I ran across them online &amp; love them now just as much as I did then.  </li>
      <li>Love these banana clips--keeps the hair off my neck and makes my hair cascade down my back, looking great!</li>
      <li>I have been searching for this product, as it is excellent for long hair, finally found it thru amazon.  </li>
      <li>My hair is going through a transitional phase right now.  </li>
      <li>Will get more just for back up.</li>
      <li>My favorite way to wear my very only hair in the summer.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t hold my long hair very securely, they slide out of place.</li>
      <li>This is a very large comb, you get two, but I have long, fine hair</li>
      <li>Great for thick hair!</li>
      <li>I have always loved banana clips and can hardly ever find them in the store.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend them!</li>
      <li>someone had shorter hair they might work better- mine is tailbone length, so it is pretty heavy.</li>
      <li>The clip is very flimsy and doesn&#x27;t hold thicker (not impossibly thick) hair in place.</li>
      <li>I have long, thick curly hair and these clips hold it up and back beautifully!</li>
      <li>I remember using these when I was in high school &amp; college, and then they disappeared.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I have always wanted these combs as i had them when i was in High School</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re a little stiff at first but work good</li>
      <li>Would NEVER waste my money purchasing this product again!</li>
      <li>Next time I will try a more expensive brand and see if it is any better.</li>
      <li>just what I have been looking for and don&#x27;t fit tight on the head.</li>
      <li>I searched high and low for a \\&quot;banana clip\\&quot; like the one I&#x27;ve had since junior high</li>
      <li>This size is hard to find, but works better for thicker and longer hair.  </li>
      <li>My 4A hair is only about 8\\&quot; long, but with these clips I can get a pretty decent afro puff without a blow out!</li>
      <li>And, actually, that&#x27;s what really matters in the end.</li>
      <li>I am growing out my relaxer and going natural.  </li>
      <li>This comb clip would probably work better on a young girl with thin straight hair.  </li>
      <li>Black was really the only useful color.</li>
      <li>However, instead of white and red, the new colors are more or less clear and brown which I can definitely use.</li>
      <li>It was priced a bit higher than what I had purchased them in the past at local drugstores, but the item is no longer available locally.</li>
      <li>I have shoulder length thick curly hair and my hair fits just fine in these combs.</li>
      <li>I have very long hair (down to the middle of my back) and these clips hold my hair back from my face securely, and it makes a lovely cascade of hair down my back.</li>
      <li>I have pretty thick hair with sometimes wavy, sometimes straight hair.</li>
      <li>I love the way they hold all of my hair together regardless if it&#x27;s thick and tangled, or even wet.  </li>
      <li>Bought because I saw a natural hair blogger named Kimmaytube use these for multiple styles for natural black hair.</li>

<li> Don&#x27;t know why these are not available in stores anymore, but I love the clip for long thick hair, feet or dry.</li>
<li> These work well with shorter hair as well as long hair.  </li>
<li> Will not hold up long.</li>
<li> so I could never get it closed properly.</li>
<li> I USED THESE 20 YEARS AGO WHEN MY HAIR WAS LONG AND NOW THAT IT&#x27;S GROWN OUT AGAIN, THEY WERE WHAT I WANTED AGAIN.  </li>

<li> and I bought the pack expecting to basically waste the white and red since I still have those mostly useless colors from the original pack.</li>
<li> I leave it open wide then carefully spread my hair out and scrunch the comb closer together.</li>
<li> not worth sending back</li>
<li> I put my hair in  a loose ponytail and place the comb in my hair vertically.</li>
<li> However, they&#x27;re made with much less sturdy plastic than the ones I had years back.  </li>
<li> so it NEVER grabs and stays closed.</li>
<li> Expensive, but you can&#x27;t really find these anywhere else!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Expensive, but you can&#x27;t really find these anywhere else!  My 4A hair is only about 8\\&quot; long, but with these clips I can get a pretty decent afro puff without a blow out!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome clip!  It holds hair extremely well and works especially well on curly or thick hair.  The clincher comb is one of the clips that tends to be hard to find in stores too so it&#x27;s sometimes just easier to get online.</li>
    <li> Came as expected, when expected, not good quality, but will continue to purchase from this seller</li>
    <li> This is a very large comb, you get two, but I have long, fine hair and it just kept sliding out.  Couldn&#x27;t use it.  not worth sending back</li>
    <li> I ahve been looking for these all over. So glad to find them on Amazon. They work great!</li>
    <li> I have pretty thick hair with sometimes wavy, sometimes straight hair. And I have a lot of it. I tried to get all of my hair into this, and the clip a. wouldn&#x27;t fit all of my hair between the combs and b. wouldn&#x27;t stay shut. I don&#x27;t want to give up on this product yet, but I am pessimistic. If you have thick hair or even just a lot of hair, I would think twice about this product.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for this product, as it is excellent for long hair, finally found it thru amazon.  It was priced a bit higher than what I had purchased them in the past at local drugstores, but the item is no longer available locally.</li>

Hope I can find some more reviews on those.</li>
    <li> Two broke right out the pack :(</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re a little stiff at first but work good</li>
    <li> My hair is going through a transitional phase right now.  I am growing out my relaxer and going natural.  Many days would be awful hair days were it not for these 7\\&quot; clips by Goody.  There are a few imitators, but not one duplicator!  I love the way they hold all of my hair together regardless if it&#x27;s thick and tangled, or even wet.  They&#x27;re the best.</li>
    <li> The comb may work for a child, but not meant for thick hair - it wouldn&#x27;t even come close to closing.  Still looking for one that will work.</li>
    <li> These long banana combs are great.  They work well to hold back my chin-length somewhat thick curly hair.  However, they&#x27;re made with much less sturdy plastic than the ones I had years back.  I use with caution because they feel like they&#x27;ll break easily.  So far so good, so we shall see.</li>
    <li> May not be the prettiest most decorative, although they hold your hair back great.  And, actually, that&#x27;s what really matters in the end.</li>
    <li> This comb clip would probably work better on a young girl with thin straight hair.  My hair is full and curly so I could never get it closed properly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found these on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is thinner than in the 80&#x27;s, but I just use clips or bobby pins to keep my hair from falling out.  They are easy to use &amp; I like the look even better than when my hair is up.  I&#x27;ve rec&#x27;vd many compliments when I use by &amp;#34;banana clips&amp;#34;.  So glad I found them &amp; have them again!</li>
    <li> Love this clip... Been looking all over for the seven inch... Always found the smaller one. I have long, thick curly hair and these clips hold it up and back beautifully! I highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> My wife was complaining she couldn&#x27;t find any banana clips, so i did one searcha nd was able to find her these.</li>
    <li> I like these combs the best,when putting them on the comb doesn&#x27;t scrap your scalp like some other combs do.</li>
    <li> I have thick curly hair and sometimes can be a bit hard to manage, but after a shower, this is music to my ears.  Light and easy to manage with my curls.  When I pressed my hair out, it was another simple fix.  Will get more just for back up.</li>
    <li> Like i said before these are the best and I will be ordering more in the future....</li>
    <li> Great for thick hair!</li>
    <li> Not for thick hair as advertised.</li>
    <li> These are great hair clips.  I remember using these when I was in high school &amp; college, and then they disappeared.  I ran across them online &amp; love them now just as much as I did then.  I have very long hair (down to the middle of my back) and these clips hold my hair back from my face securely, and it makes a lovely cascade of hair down my back.</li>
    <li> I have been looking everywhere! I know they are so 80&#x27;s I guess, But I love them. I don&#x27;t like the little ones because my hair is thick and shoulder length and I need it to pull up off my neck, so these are perfect. So glad to find!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t hold my long hair very securely, they slide out of place. Also difficult to get in to begin with. If they had a tighter grip it might be fine. Also a bit difficult to snap together.&lt;br /&gt;If someone had shorter hair they might work better- mine is tailbone length, so it is pretty heavy.</li>
    <li> too long on head but fits my very thick hair</li>
    <li> Love these clips, work well. Seller packaged well and on time.</li>
    <li> Bought because I saw a natural hair blogger named Kimmaytube use these for multiple styles for natural black hair. They work great. Now, it only I could find them.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know why these are not available in stores anymore, but I love the clip for long thick hair, feet or dry.</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length thick curly hair and my hair fits just fine in these combs. I was so shocked. I put my hair in  a loose ponytail and place the comb in my hair vertically. It makes it way easy to close it doing it that way. When I do close it I leave it open wide then carefully spread my hair out and scrunch the comb closer together.</li>
    <li> My favorite way to wear my very only hair in the summer. My hair is very thick and pony tails give me a head ache and braids are to time consuming  to put in. These go in very quickly and look amazing, get many complements on my hair.</li>
    <li> These are the same that I used to buy over a decade ago, I was so happy to find them again</li>
    <li> This size is hard to find, but works better for thicker and longer hair.  Arrived promptly in package.</li>
    <li> Years ago I bought the Goody 3 pk and the colors were white, red and black. Black was really the only useful color. Somehow I lost the black (which isn&#x27;t sold separately) and I bought the pack expecting to basically waste the white and red since I still have those mostly useless colors from the original pack. However, instead of white and red, the new colors are more or less clear and brown which I can definitely use. The secure mechanism holds together even better than the original set. Going to order an extra set for if and when needed years from now!!!</li>
    <li> Flimsy plastic. Will not hold up long. I wish there was a reliable source for these in a rainbow of colors.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for the \\&quot;real\\&quot; banana clips forever! These are terrific for curly hair! Keeps your hair in place and out of your eyes. What a great find!</li>
    <li> I searched high and low for a \\&quot;banana clip\\&quot; like the one I&#x27;ve had since junior high and I am 37 now. These clips are the perfect length. The problem is the side that is to be opened and closed has a little bitty ball on it so it NEVER grabs and stays closed. I have thick hair, however as you see from my first sentence I have managed to have the same clip practically my entire life and never broke that or had one issue. I am very disappointed in this purchase and since I had to open it to find out it will never be used I can&#x27;t do anything with them.</li>
    <li> I USED THESE 20 YEARS AGO WHEN MY HAIR WAS LONG AND NOW THAT IT&#x27;S GROWN OUT AGAIN, THEY WERE WHAT I WANTED AGAIN.  CAN&#x27;T FIND &#x27;EM IN THE STORES.  I LIKE THE EASE OF USE AND THE FACT THAT THEY GIVE A SASSY OR EVEN MORE DRESSED-UP LOOK TO A PONYTAIL.  OF COURSE THEY WORK BETTER WITH THICKER OR EVEN CURLY HAIR TYPES.</li>
    <li> This is my go-to hair tool.  I like using these instead of a pony tail holder because I get more volume whereas the ponytail restricts your hair.  These work well with shorter hair as well as long hair.  I used these a lot while I was transitioning.  Although, after a while the fastening mechanism starts to lose grip and pop open.</li>
    <li> I have always loved banana clips and can hardly ever find them in the store.  They work great for my hair and I have very thick long hair so I have a hard time finding something that will keep my hair up.  I love them.</li>
    <li> Very thin and cheaply made, not the Goody product line I was used to. Picture doesn&#x27;t show you how thin they are.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Goody clincher combs for many years.  This was truly a big disappointment for the comb was half the weight of the ones which goody produced years ago.  It is very flimsy and doesnt support my long thick hair.  Would NEVER waste my money purchasing this product again!</li>
    <li> 7&amp;#34; is too big for me...but this is a good product</li>
    <li> Recieved item asap and it was just what I wanted......Thanks for the great product....The hair clips are not in stores around my area....</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find these in stores. These are the ORIGINAL banana clip by GOODY. LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE THEME!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> Too flimsy. Unable to hold my hair.</li>
    <li> just what I have been looking for and don&#x27;t fit tight on the head. love them. I bout 2 sets cause I love these things</li>
    <li> Love these banana clips--keeps the hair off my neck and makes my hair cascade down my back, looking great! Just love these and highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> love love love the banana clips. so easy to make hair look good pulled back, they stayed in great and the price was great also</li>
    <li> I have always wanted these combs as i had them when i was in High School and they are a life saver for my hair.  These are it for me.  Highly recommended.</li>
