      <li>I like them and will buy more.</li>
      <li>I LOVE the shape of these beautiful lashes and you get so many for a fraction of the cost of other ones that arent even as comfortable as these ones here!</li>

      <li>this product is so cheap.</li>
      <li>they are very flexible and way more comfortable than the ones in the drug stores ...</li>
      <li>It gives me full volume lashes.</li>
      <li>These are really pretty lashes!</li>
      <li>but I would buy other products from this seller because they have super low prices and great delivery service :)</li>
      <li>and hopefully you do the right choice</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t wear them on a day to day basis or even to formal events, but for costumes they&#x27;re perfect to get that dramatic lash effect to show up in photos.</li>
      <li>Although the hairs did not look natural, I liked the way these eyelashes defined the natural (almond) shape of my eyes.</li>
      <li>Very low price for a lot of cute lashes.</li>
      <li>but they are really pretty.</li>
      <li>But over all pretty decent for the price.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not too much</li>
      <li>They ship fast too.</li>
      <li>And they are kind of stiff.  </li>
      <li>But if you can handle that then overall it&#x27;s not a bad purchase.</li>
      <li>they are also soft which i like because they won&#x27;t irritate as much.</li>
      <li>they&#x27;re nice and thick.</li>
      <li>And one other thing I had trim them to fit.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to find good lashes like these, especially for this price!!!</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>I bought them only for cosplay and they work really really well for that.</li>
      <li>However, personally I didn&#x27;t like the look or feel of the lashes they feel like paper and look very unreal.</li>
      <li>But the texture wasn&#x27;t soft</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re thick and full!</li>
      <li>Love them just wish they didnt have to b shipped on the slow boat from china lol.they r baby dollish which is gd for my big hazel eyes</li>
      <li>And me I need more practice on applying false eyelashes.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing false eyelashes for about 4 years, so I&#x27;ve been through a lot of them and these are my ultimate favorite.</li>
      <li>Although I did have to trim a little off, because my eyes can&#x27;t use the whole falsies.</li>

<li> It took SOOO long for me to receive this</li>
<li> I received these days earlier then expected.</li>
<li> However they do have the heavy feel and are long so need to be cut to your size.</li>
<li> They are a little Harder around the band</li>
<li> but I think they will last longer and not pull apart a easily,they are somewhat thick but that means no need for mascara.</li>
<li> picture does not lie , and they come in black .</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s not too less</li>
<li> Dont waste your money.</li>
<li> its messy work.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t buy it , waste of money .</li>
<li> the lashes are stiff and the glue doesn&#x27;t apply well on these..</li>
<li> Yes, they are from plastic and are tough to put on, but with a little practice and bending they should find shape..</li>
<li> They are plastic and they are hard to put on because they are plastic....</li>
<li> Could not form them to my lashes and they were too hard in texture, irritated my eyes..</li>
<li> Not good for beginners.</li>

    <li> if your looking for doll eyes or just simple lashes ,these are the best ! picture does not lie , and they come in black . not &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; brown. ♥ will order again soon and hopefully you do the right choice (:</li>
    <li> Holds up for their for purpose.</li>
    <li> Although the hairs did not look natural, I liked the way these eyelashes defined the natural (almond) shape of my eyes. They added to the drama of my makeup in a good way. I will be buying these eyelashes again.</li>
    <li> Delivery was not a problem and they described the product perfectly. However, personally I didn&#x27;t like the look or feel of the lashes they feel like paper and look very unreal. I wouldn&#x27;t buy them again but I would buy other products from this seller because they have super low prices and great delivery service :)</li>
    <li> I received these days earlier then expected. They seem really nice I have not worn them yet but they are really pretty.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the shape of these beautiful lashes and you get so many for a fraction of the cost of other ones that arent even as comfortable as these ones here! Super super comfy, and incredibly extravagant! Just love the way they make my eyes pop :)</li>
    <li> they&#x27;re nice and thick. they are also soft which i like because they won&#x27;t irritate as much. wish the inner corner would be shorter though.</li>
    <li> Plastic looking. Not good for beginners. But over all pretty decent for the price.</li>
    <li> I just got these in the mail today and Wow! They are much better than what I was looking to get.I was not going to wear lashes today but Hey- I just had to try them on, and Yes-Great Buy! They are a little Harder around the band but I think they will last longer and not pull apart a easily,they are somewhat thick but that means no need for mascara.I like them and will buy more.They ship fast too.</li>
    <li> Wish I can give 0 star.  There were glue all over the lash, how am I going to wear that? its messy work.  Dont waste your money.</li>
    <li> I got it become I never wear eyelash so I try it ... Now I am in love with how I look 😍 very nice and good for a first timer ..I also went on YouTube to see how to put them on ...</li>
    <li> Love them just wish they didnt have to b shipped on the slow boat from china lol.they r baby dollish which is gd for my big hazel eyes n they have a great n affordable price recived them today ordering the nxt box now before these run out..</li>
    <li> Their a perfect sexy length I love this product it&#x27;s not too much and it&#x27;s not too less it&#x27;s great! But the texture wasn&#x27;t soft it feels like plastic, and I only wore one pair once and it already came apart when I took them off my eyelids. And one other thing I had trim them to fit.</li>
    <li> Very very cute eyelashes. Gives you the drastic look! However they do have the heavy feel and are long so need to be cut to your size. And me I need more practice on applying false eyelashes. If I was perfect at it I&#x27;d apply them everyday lol</li>
    <li> Did not like the quality of the eye lashes. Could not form them to my lashes and they were too hard in texture, irritated my eyes..</li>
    <li> I love this! It gives me full volume lashes. Since I&#x27;m asian I kinda look like a doll wearing these. Although I did have to trim a little off, because my eyes can&#x27;t use the whole falsies. All in all, these are a nice try for the price. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Lashes are greatly price you cannot beat it at all for the amount that your getting.  I would not purchase if your not use to wearing a thicker band of lashes.  And they are kind of stiff.  But if you can handle that then overall it&#x27;s not a bad purchase.</li>
    <li> Loving these lashes..</li>
    <li> awesome they feel great look good and were really cheap! way better then paying $4 + per pair normally, great</li>
    <li> I bought them only for cosplay and they work really really well for that. I wouldn&#x27;t wear them on a day to day basis or even to formal events, but for costumes they&#x27;re perfect to get that dramatic lash effect to show up in photos. I trim mine a teeny bit and then apply glue and they fit like a glove.</li>
    <li> These are really pretty lashes! They&#x27;re very beautiful and were packaged neatly. Very low price for a lot of cute lashes.</li>
    <li> I love this eyelashes. They&#x27;re thick and full! Yes, they are from plastic and are tough to put on, but with a little practice and bending they should find shape..even though I think beginners should probably stay away from these unless they do want to practice and carry back up glue just incase! I&#x27;ve been wearing false eyelashes for about 4 years, so I&#x27;ve been through a lot of them and these are my ultimate favorite. I will be buying again when I run out!</li>
    <li> Five stars for its quality and fit for my eyes. It&#x27;s hard to find good lashes like these, especially for this price!!!</li>
