      <li>Very happy so far with the purchase.</li>
      <li>the cream is perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll probably use the ultralight for more neck/chest/arms.</li>
      <li>&amp; I&#x27;m glad I found this brand.  </li>
      <li>Would love to try the lighter version of this.</li>
      <li>I have been searching for a lightweight daily moisturizer with SPF for a while now, and this one is perfect.  </li>
      <li>Just OK, but won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
      <li>Also, I love the scent.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love it</li>
      <li>It smells like lavender which I love.</li>
      <li>I love it, and I hope it&#x27;ll always be available!</li>
      <li>I ordered it and enjoyed it.  </li>
      <li>I feel like this one covers better, absorbs better</li>
      <li>also purchased the KS ultralight moisturizer with spf and even though it is substantially cheaper, I have to say I like this one better.</li>
      <li>Very rich.</li>
      <li>The product has a lovely citrus scent, rubs in easily leaving no residue and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or eyes.  </li>
      <li>I think I will try the Ultra Light for summer, when I get more</li>
      <li>One thing that bothers me is the strong scent.</li>
      <li>So I found kimberly sayer and so far, am loving it!</li>
      <li>Also purchase from same vendor as first time and this seller is awesome.</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and you don&#x27;t even realize it&#x27;s there.  </li>
      <li>Just browsing on Amazon, I came across the Kimberly Sayer Ultra Light moisturizer SPF 30.  </li>
      <li>but the more I read about the chemicals, the less happy I was.  </li>
      <li>So glad I finally found a natural face lotion with spf that I can really be happy about putting on my face.</li>
      <li>It smells like lavender but that fades relatively quickly.</li>
      <li>this lotion is gentle, smeels great and has improved my rosacea and dry skin.</li>
      <li>Love that its all natural.  </li>
      <li>I have been searching for a great natural face moisturizer with sunscreen for the last year or two.</li>
      <li>Love that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
      <li>(felt like the ultralight sort of wiped off), stays on a better, and actually makes my skin feel silky smooth rather than tacky.</li>
      <li>natural ingredients + non-chemical spf - very rare to find this combination!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for years and years--it&#x27;s the one product I&#x27;ve been completely loyal to since the first use.  </li>
      <li>In fact, it soaks right in, with no heaviness</li>
      <li>Oil free moisturizers for oily skin would leave my skin dry, others were too greasy and make me break out, this one is perfect: creamy and lightweight at the same time, I am definitely going to try something else from Kimberly Sayer.</li>
      <li>Strong lavender scent initially, which disappears quickly.</li>
      <li>The smell is pretty offensive, and the cream does not absorb into the skin well at all.</li>
      <li>Very high quality.</li>
      <li>It makes a perfect base for my foundation, which goes on perfectly smoothly, regardless of whether I use a powder or cream formulation.  </li>
      <li>I live in Hawaii, so the humidity here can make moisturizers sticky that I&#x27;m guessing would be fine if I were back in the northeast or rockies in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I have tried many moisturizers, and this is definitely the one I&#x27;ve been least satisfied with.</li>
      <li>It feels silky smooth on my dry skin.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I kept trying the new improved versions with no luck.  </li>
      <li>I have pretty normal skin, and have tried everything from drugstore brands to expensive/premium, JASON Organics Ester-C, to Juice Beauty mineral sheer moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I am VERY sensitive to skin products and had no problem whatsoever with this one.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and this has been the answer to my prayers!  </li>
      <li>this is the first product ever that I have totally finished and bought another jar of cause</li>
      <li>I like spf 30 annd being a natural product.  </li>
      <li>By the end of the day my face feels so soft.</li>
      <li>The sunscreen is natural SPF 30.</li>
      <li>I had high hopes as this the only organic face cream I could find with SPF 30, but there is nothing I like about it.</li>
      <li>Finally I embarked on a search for a new brand.  </li>
      <li>I would keep trying to rub it in, and pretty quickly it would start pilling and look even worse.</li>
      <li>Love the fresh lavender (real lavender essential oil, no fragrance crap) scent</li>
      <li>Even though this is pretty expensive, it is in a jar (which makes it easier to use all of it), and you really don&#x27;t need to use very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I like this cream enough but it&#x27;s hard to smooth all over your face.</li>
      <li>I realize everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but this product did not absorb quickly for me and did not seem to moisturize my dry skin as well as other products.  </li>
      <li>Nearly everything left my face either sticky (jason) or white residue and sticky (Juice).</li>
      <li>I loved it, but it got very expensive as the bottle comes in just the 0.5oz.</li>
      <li>Goes on silky smooth, protects from sunburn, smells lovely and not filled with chemicals that are bad for your body.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Love that its all natural.  I&#x27;ve been trying to reduce the amount of chemicals that go in &amp; on my body &amp; I&#x27;m glad I found this brand.  It feels silky smooth on my dry skin.  It smells like lavender which I love. The sunscreen is natural SPF 30.</li>
    <li> natural ingredients + non-chemical spf - very rare to find this combination! the cream is perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> this lotion is gentle, smeels great and has improved my rosacea and dry skin. The spf portection is something I have been looking for for quite a while. Organic product is the best of bonuses.</li>
    <li> this is the first product ever that I have totally finished and bought another jar of cause I was so happy. Makeup goes on beautifully on this. Also purchase from same vendor as first time and this seller is awesome.</li>
    <li> I am a sunscreen fanatic. I&#x27;m 33 and have been wearing sunscreen since I was 13. I have to have sunscreen moisturizer that&#x27;s at least 30 spf, doesn&#x27;t have toxic ingredients, is thin enough to wear under makeup (primer &amp; foundation), and doesn&#x27;t smell like sunscreen. This checks all the boxes. It smells like lavender but that fades relatively quickly. Great great moisturizer. Not thick, goes on and feels great, and layers great under makeup!</li>
    <li> As a long time DeVita solar protective moisturizer user, I was frustrated by the change in their ingredients.  Not only did it resist rubbing in, leaving white patches, it irritated both my skin and eyes.  I kept trying the new improved versions with no luck.  Finally I embarked on a search for a new brand.  But all the mineral based sunscreen moisturizers did the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In desperation I turned to a Neutrogena chemical based sunscreen moisturizer.  It did work but the more I read about the chemicals, the less happy I was.  Just browsing on Amazon, I came across the Kimberly Sayer Ultra Light moisturizer SPF 30.  It had great reviews and a great ingredient list.  I ordered it and enjoyed it.  The product has a lovely citrus scent, rubs in easily leaving no residue and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or eyes.  Still it didn&#x27;t seem quite as moisturizing as I&#x27;d like.  In cruising Amazon, I found this sister product for dry skin.  For me, it is perfect.  Love the fresh lavender (real lavender essential oil, no fragrance crap) scent and it sinks in with no effort, leaving my skin soft but not oily.  I think I will try the Ultra Light for summer, when I get more oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Ms. Sayer!  I just hope Amazon keeps carrying it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. Soaks into my skin and reduces wrinkles. I have been using it for a year with her night cream. I absolutely love it</li>
    <li> Very happy so far with the purchase. I&#x27;ve previously tried Josie Maran&#x27;s spf 40 product as my daytime moisturizer. I loved it, but it got very expensive as the bottle comes in just the 0.5oz. So I found kimberly sayer and so far, am loving it! It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. It doesn&#x27;t leave a white film at all on my face (as other mineral sunscreens can do). It smells like lavender, which I like so I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> I like this cream enough but it&#x27;s hard to smooth all over your face. Once it touches your skin it isn&#x27;t going anywhere. Very rich.</li>
    <li> One thing that bothers me is the strong scent.</li>
    <li> Edited after using I discovered that Vitamin A has been linked to tumors and it is not recommended to be used when exposed to sun.  I threw this product away.  Bummer.</li>
    <li> Just OK, but won&#x27;t buy again. Strong lavender scent initially, which disappears quickly. I realize everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but this product did not absorb quickly for me and did not seem to moisturize my dry skin as well as other products.  It appears to work well as a sun screen.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost 9 months and I am very impressed by it. I could tell the difference in my skin in just a few days. I am VERY sensitive to skin products and had no problem whatsoever with this one. Very high quality. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a great natural face moisturizer with sunscreen for the last year or two. And this is it! I have pretty normal skin, and have tried everything from drugstore brands to expensive/premium, JASON Organics Ester-C, to Juice Beauty mineral sheer moisturizer. Nearly everything left my face either sticky (jason) or white residue and sticky (Juice). I live in Hawaii, so the humidity here can make moisturizers sticky that I&#x27;m guessing would be fine if I were back in the northeast or rockies in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also purchased the KS ultralight moisturizer with spf and even though it is substantially cheaper, I have to say I like this one better. I feel like this one covers better, absorbs better (felt like the ultralight sort of wiped off), stays on a better, and actually makes my skin feel silky smooth rather than tacky. I&#x27;ll probably use the ultralight for more neck/chest/arms. Even though this is pretty expensive, it is in a jar (which makes it easier to use all of it), and you really don&#x27;t need to use very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does have a scent that is pretty strong, but I felt like it wasn&#x27;t awful, and it dissipates pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT! So glad I finally found a natural face lotion with spf that I can really be happy about putting on my face.</li>
    <li> Best cream I evervhave</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for years and years--it&#x27;s the one product I&#x27;ve been completely loyal to since the first use.  It relies only on mineral sunscreens but leaves none of the white chalkiness commonly associated with those minerals.  In fact, it soaks right in, with no heaviness whatever.  It makes a perfect base for my foundation, which goes on perfectly smoothly, regardless of whether I use a powder or cream formulation.  I love it, and I hope it&#x27;ll always be available!</li>
    <li> I like spf 30 annd being a natural product.  It doesn&#x27;t give enough moisture so I usually mix with another moisturizer.  I still like it.  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin and this seems to control my oily t - zone well. By the end of the day my face feels so soft. Love that it&#x27;s all natural. Definitely my go to sunscreen lotion this summer. Would love to try the lighter version of this. I would repurchase this as well but a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes as this the only organic face cream I could find with SPF 30, but there is nothing I like about it. The smell is pretty offensive, and the cream does not absorb into the skin well at all. I have dark skin, and it looks like I put thin layer of white chalk all over my face.

It goes on smoothly and you don&#x27;t even realize it&#x27;s there.  Also, I love the scent.  Will definitely be buying this again!</li>
    <li> I have combination, acne prone skin. Oil free moisturizers for oily skin would leave my skin dry, others were too greasy and make me break out, this one is perfect: creamy and lightweight at the same time, I am definitely going to try something else from Kimberly Sayer.</li>
    <li> Goes on silky smooth, protects from sunburn, smells lovely and not filled with chemicals that are bad for your body. This is the only moisturizer you need!</li>
