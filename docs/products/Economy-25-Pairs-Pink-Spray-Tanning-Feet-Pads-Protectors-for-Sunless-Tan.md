<li> Feet are not shielded from overspray, which soaks into the thin paper stock to create a weeklong mess on the bottom of one&#x27;s feet, particularly at the 2 stick points.</li>
<li> My only complaint is that they stick a little too well - they sometimes hurt to take off.  </li>
<li> These are cardboard and there are two little strips of tape to stick to your feet.</li>
<li> I wear a seven shoe and sticky places end up in wrong place; sticky feet were a lot bigger than a seven.</li>
<li> They have 2 small rectangular sticker pads.</li>
<li> They are hard to get off and usually break off into small pieces that I have to pick off the bottom of my feet.</li>
<li> You get what you pay for, and these are close to useless.</li>
<li> These sticky feet are very thin.  </li>
<li> Disappointing.</li>

    <li> Don&#x27;t purchase! You get what you pay for, and these are close to useless. Feet are not shielded from overspray, which soaks into the thin paper stock to create a weeklong mess on the bottom of one&#x27;s feet, particularly at the 2 stick points. After using 5 times too many, I&#x27;ll be throwing these out when the new ones arrive tomorrow.</li>
    <li> These sticky feet are very thin.  They end up really sticking to my feet once they get wet.  They are hard to get off and usually break off into small pieces that I have to pick off the bottom of my feet.</li>
    <li> Very nice product for the money. Has two sticky strips which is enough to keep them on and not crazy hard to take off like some.</li>
    <li> Great quality, fast shipping. But all were the same foot. Was not a professional look for my company.</li>
    <li> Should have listened to he reviews. Two left feet. Disappointing.</li>
    <li> These are cardboard and there are two little strips of tape to stick to your feet.</li>
    <li> Great for keeping the bottom of your feet clean and not tanned when you spray tan. I like them a lot. The glue holds them on an the bottom of my feet are no longer tanning along with my body.</li>
    <li> These work really well to make sure you dont end up with the bottom of your feet being brown.  We now use these everytime.  They stick realy well and I would suggest it.  We will buy these again for our brown bodies....and white bottom feet!</li>
    <li> Easy to use, protects well, and is recyclable.</li>
    <li> These were shipped VERY quickly...and as far as quality, for the price, I guess they were okay. I mis-read or didn&#x27;t pay attention that they were made from card stock. I was used to the ones sold at the salon...much better quality, but more expensive as well. When using these just make sure you do not have lotion on the bottom of your feet or they will not stick well. And if they recently cleaned the spray tan booth, be VERY careful not to step in a wet spot as they will fall apart.

    <li> I use these for personal use. They stay on the bottom of my feet and pull off easily.</li>
    <li> For one, I thought they were normal sticky feet, they are not. They have 2 small rectangular sticker pads. I thought this is cheap and not what I had thought. But I gave 3 stars since they actually stayed on during service and were pretty sticky. Still, not what I thought they were but comparatively the price is ok for qty.</li>
    <li> The price is perfect and the item was shipped promply...My clients like the color but I wish they stuck to the feet a little better. I will buy them again because they are a good value.</li>
    <li> I wear a seven shoe and sticky places end up in wrong place; sticky feet were a lot bigger than a seven. It would be nice if these came in different sizes. The sticky parts didn&#x27;t adhere and couldn&#x27;t even rotate positions in the Mystic Spray Tanning booth without the feet falling off.</li>
