      <li>I ordered the flat irons after 2 of my friends told me how they liked their hair after a stylist used on their natural hair.  </li>
      <li>The packaging on my item was what it should be, and it came with a really nice storage/carrying case in a black croc design.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works great.. Love this product and it makes my hair look great.. Wished I had purchased it along ago. Would recommend</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron. I only wish it were thinner like the last one I bought of this brand. It never snags your hair. It is a smooth glide.</li>
    <li> I hesitated to buy this item because other reviewers said that this was a knock off.  No, it isn&#x27;t.  Yes it is indeed made in China, but after doing some minor research I did discover that Babyliss has a plant in China, and a lot of their stuff comes out of that plant.  I compared this item to the irons on the manufacturer&#x27;s website, and this is indeed a genuine Babyliss. The packaging on my item was what it should be, and it came with a really nice storage/carrying case in a black croc design.  Now,  of course, perhaps the other reviewers may have received an item that was different than the one I got....I will NEVER call someone else a liar....but I will firmly attest to the fact that this iron is genuine, very well made and works like a dream.  It straightened both human and synthetic hair wonderfully, and also made some awesome long lasting curls when I used it for that purpose.  It did not burn anything.  And I should add that I am hardly a professional at using a flat iron.  I had a cheap 9.99 piece of junk that was ok, but didn&#x27;t give great results.  But this iron...even in my hands....makes me look like I know what I am doing.  I am glad I got it and the price was fabulous.</li>
    <li> It heats up very quickly and makes my hair look perfect! My hair stays straight the ENTIRE day and doesn&#x27;t do too much damage!</li>
    <li> Works even on my natural hair but blow dry hair out first and apply smoothing product.  I would recommend it as it is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
    <li> This straightening does a great job.</li>
    <li> I have to make this quick, but the title says it all. I absolutely love this iron. I am have type 3C and 4A hair (some pinky-sized curls, some kinky) and this iron leaves my coarse hair silky and super shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference, I use Aveda Dry Remedy shampoo &amp; conditioner along with the Aveda Smooth Infusion (which also serves as a heat protector). For the coarse section of my hair, I sometimes use the Aveda Brilliant Universal Styling Creme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re on a tighter budget, BioInfusion (at Walgreen&#x27;s) has a decent line of product and the polishing serum is a great alternative. You just have to be your own judge of how much to use based upon your hair type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have super thick hair so I blow-dry in small layers with a round brush using my Conair Infinity Ceramic Tourmaline blow dryer. It does a great job but now I want the BaByliss blow dryer that matches this flat iron. After blow drying, I flat iron in small layers to get it silky smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully this review is useful to someone. I figured it would be best to show HOW I use it to explain why I think the results are so good.</li>
    <li> This flat iron works really well! It glides along hair without getting any of the hair stuck in between the plates and it also works for curling your hair as well. I recommend this to anyone looking for a semi-salon quality straightener with a good price. It&#x27;s not a Chi, but it&#x27;s a gaziliion times better than anything in your local Target.</li>
    <li> This straightener works perfect my hair is very curly and it makes my hair perfectly straight. and is very economic compared to hair straighteners that are over priced. it also has a 10 year warranty i believe.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had cheaper flat irons in the past, and I&#x27;ve had to go over and over the same section of hair just to get it straightened.  And then, with the slightest hint of humidity, poof!  Frizz &amp; waves were back.  With this incredible straightener, I only have to go over each section once or maybe twice to get it completely straight, and then it stays straight, no matter what the weather is like.  People always compliment me on how shiny &amp; healthy my hair looks, and I swear it seems to be straighter after I wash it now, which is fine by me.  I don&#x27;t even have to blow dry my hair anymore, I just let it air dry &amp; then straighten it, usually takes me 10 minutes or less.  I don&#x27;t give many items 5 stars, but this one definitely deserves it!</li>
    <li> This is hands down THE best flat iron ever. There is a lot of long hair in my house and we have used many different brands of flat irons. I purchased a white one a couple years ago at Marshalls only because the price was right and I liked the little rhinestone detailing. It was so darn amazing that I needed to get one for myself. The first one was a gift for my daughter. I got lucky at Marshalls on rh orice. After researching online, this was the best price I could find. Honestly this iron is probably worth double. It smootgs hair so perfectly and has heat settings up to 500 degrees. You can certainly get your hair pin steaight in a hurry with this one!</li>
    <li> Wife uses the fire outta this thing. She loves it and it&#x27;s the best one we ever bought. Better than her chi was</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t buy again for the price burns up to fast</li>
    <li> Broke my last one and thought I was going down 1 level in quality....NOT SO!! BaByliss is ALWAYS the way to go</li>
    <li> It stopped working like a month after I bought it. It looked nice but it didn&#x27;t last at all .</li>
    <li> My hairdresser had recommended this brand, Babyliss, to me.  I&#x27;m so glad I took her advice.  This iron is fantastic!  I love the adjustable heat dial feature.  It only takes 2 passes and my hair is straightened.  My natural hair texture is wavy and it takes me about 15 minutes from start to finish to straighten my hair with this iron.  BTW, my hair is so shiny when it&#x27;s done too, an added bonus.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my girlfriend for Christmas, and she fell in love with it. I didn&#x27;t know a whole lot about this or other products, but would highly recommend. She says that the temperature settings are a must, and it keeps her hair smooth longer. Huge improvement over her previous straightener. The price was right to. Can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> this flat iron works great. I have natural hair, and this iron was able to get my hair very straight!</li>
    <li> It works so much better than mine on my super thick hair. It is the perfect size and I love the different temp levels.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll give it a 5 because wife has used for a year and really likes it. This work as good today as did a year ago.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a titanium iron at this price and this one hits the mark. It heats up quickly and I&#x27;m able to style my hair (I have a ton of it), in 5 minutes!!</li>
    <li> I decided to upgrade my flat iron and i wasnt sure what kind to get. i actually looked up videos on Youtube of people using Babyliss products so i could actually see it working. this iron is awesome. be careful though it gets REALLY HOT really fast. i have already burned my hand a couple times but that was my fault. the only thing i dont like about it is its kind of slippery (hence the burnt hand) so you have to really hold onto it and take time with it. sometimes i like to do a quick sweep of my hair for a touch up but you have to be careful. i am not sure what the exact temp is that i use it on but i have the dial to 30 for my curly/wavy thick hair. it is pretty awesome. it took me at least 45 mins to do my hair with my old iron and this only takes about 20!</li>
    <li> I brought it for my daughters hair because it is hard to press.  It worked like a charm with no effort.  Baby bliss is my new hair appliance line.  I fully recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive been using the iron for a few months. And it just gets better.  Her hair is holding the press and have found the best setting.</li>
    <li> Great pruducts. My wife love it. She told me that the babyliss pro doesn&#x27;t burn her hair. I bought like a year ago an still working.</li>
    <li> The item totally answered my expectations. The hair is shiny and soft. Item is very easy to use. Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> I have curly thick hair and this gets the job done! Heats up fast and the rhinestones make me like it even more!</li>
    <li> Great alternative to the overrated Chi - I have really think wavy/frizzy/curly-ish hair and this does the trick</li>
    <li> The iron was shipped to me really quickly and it works amazingly. Nothing has ever worked better on my hair. I love it!</li>
    <li> I have normal hair, it isn&#x27;t too thin nor is it dry. I started using the iron on medium heat because my hair is typically easy to straighten. At first I LOVED the results but after about a week I noticed strands of my hair were broken about where I start straightening it.  I&#x27;ve never had an iron singe my hair off. Others have obviously had better luck with this than me. I would have retuned it but I no longer have the box. So now I have damaged hair that is going to take some time to grow out and a highly damaging straightener.</li>
    <li> i work at a salon where the owner requires us to have this particular brand. so if it is good for the pros imagine how it will work for someone at home.....this product is for the serious straightener user. you wont regret your purchase.</li>
    <li> It worked great for a week or two but last Monday the wires in it was messing up every time I plug it in and start straightening If I move the cord to much the straightener shuts off.  It continued to get worse so I threw it away so it won&#x27;t cause a fire in my house and continue using my old one</li>
    <li> I have only used this iron once since I received it and it works really well. I have natural thick curly hair and the iron worked perfectly to get my hair silky smooth and straight with little effort. I noticed that the swivel cord was long which is a plus because it gives you length to move around. It heats up quickly. The plates did not snag my hair at all. I like that the buttons are not in the way so you don&#x27;t mistakenly change temp settings or turn it off, which is my experience with previous flat irons. Very awesome flat iron!!</li>
    <li> There is no other Flat Iron Like this one. It gets the job done in one session. I wouldn&#x27;t trade for anything else. My mom has the Chi and it doesn&#x27;t work as good as my Diamond Titanium :) It leaves your hair shinny, soft and beautiful. My hair is curly, full and thick and all I have to do is straighten it one time and I am good for a good two weeks if I want to. I have had it for almost a year now and its still going strong.  :)</li>
    <li> No matter what you doing, this cd is great to listen to.  ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS WOMANS VOICE!  Highly recommend to friends!</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is hard to control and dry. We had a CHI before and this one worked better. It&#x27;s fast, easy to use and does not damage her hair.</li>
    <li> This brand is one of the best straightener brands out there. I have been using this brand for years now and have never had a problem. It&#x27;s lightweight and works amazing. I would recommend this to anyone who straighteners their hair everyday.</li>
    <li> Love this Flatiron! Love the quality.. I need a curling iron with the same titanium structure.</li>
    <li> I have been using CHI for 5 years and love it! But my dog chewed the cord and it stopped wrking, so I had to get a new one, I couldn&#x27;t afford another chi at the moment, so my friend referred babyliss pro, I gave it a try, but I can tell you, is totally fake, the box came open, the iron is heavy, and burns ur hair, I compared with the ones on babyliss pro website, and it looks completed different from the one they are selling here! Anyways, I just want to help who are looking for a new flat iron like I was, don&#x27;t wast ur money on this!</li>
    <li> My old KeratinPerfect Iron stoped working on me! only had it a year and actually paid 150!! it was Garbage, so need something fast to seal my keratin treatment, as well as being titanium so it would not absorb the keratin in my hair. Glides nice and smooth, heats fast and damn its only 50!!!!!!!! Stumbled across this looking for top rated irons under 60! Lets see how long it lasts, but so far so good, thanks amazon!</li>
    <li> It heats up very fast and comes in a nice case.  It straightens very well and the plates are long so you can get a lot of hair in one movement.  It has a nice long cord and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> I ordered the flat irons after 2 of my friends told me how they liked their hair after a stylist used on their natural hair.  I purchased for me to use on my daughter&#x27;s hair who is natural and I love it and the straight style last much longer than with the other flat irons we already have.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had a problem with hair breakage until I used this flat iron.  I can only contribute this to the iron.</li>
    <li> Makes hair shiny!  Heats up fast and runs smoothly through the hair.  I would recommend this iron - comes with a nice case too.</li>
    <li> This has been by far the best!  Better than any straightener I have had including a Chi!  I am Mexican n have thick natural curly hair before I wud take 50-55 mins to straighten but now I can do in about 30-35 mins!  I had a gf recommend this to me cuz she got as a Xmas gift and I still thk her!  U will not be disappointed !</li>
    <li> It heats up in seconds.  I have kinky hair and this BaByliss is perfect for it.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product is fake and so are all other products claiming to be a babyliss product and made in China. Babyliss is made in ITALY! Once I recieved my iron in and began using it, 3 days later i have fried hair! I have never fried my hair! What a piece of junk, and shame on China for claiming to be something thier not. DO NOT WAIST YOUR MONEY! and i dont think they will be returning me mine ;/</li>
