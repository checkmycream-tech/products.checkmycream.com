      <li>I love that it&#x27;s organic.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok, but it doesn&#x27;t give my hair the body it needs.  </li>

      <li>&amp; I don&#x27;t get many uses out of it.</li>
      <li>I love the lemon smell though.  </li>
      <li>kind of like a light lemon pledge scent and plastic.</li>
      <li>I cannot use conditioner and many brands of shampoo because of it.</li>
      <li>Safe for Celiacs.</li>
      <li>I recant my positive review and will have to keep looking for a good shampoo for oily hair.     </li>
      <li>My hair looks and feels super healthy.</li>
      <li>Smells great and is what I consider a deep cleanser.  </li>
      <li>Lemon lingers in hair and makes it very shiny, nice product.</li>
      <li>After just 1 wash I was oil free.</li>
      <li>I could never get my hair clean after trying númerouse shampoos.</li>
      <li>Leaves hair clean and with just a hint of fragrance.</li>
      <li>I love the shampoo and delivery was fast.</li>
      <li>Love this brand and this particular one smells like you are washing your hair with a lemon chiffon pie.  </li>
      <li>Seller shipped fairly quickly and product was packaged well.</li>
      <li>Love this shampoo along with many of their other products, it smells amazing and leaves my hair feeling so clean and soft, love all the natural ingredients</li>

      <li>This is the ONLY shampoo and conditioner that I have found that cleans her hair, keeps it oil-free and smells amazing.</li>
      <li>Best shampoo for my daughter&#x27;s thin hair.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny.</li>
      <li>By far my favorite shampoo.</li>
      <li>Sure enough, I got it today and palm oil is an ingredient.</li>
      <li>Really like this organic shampoo!</li>
      <li>I do not use any styling products except coconut oil on my tips and yet, only clarifying shampoo made my hair somewhat more manageable.</li>
      <li>time I tried to switch to a more gentle shampoo the dandruff came back until I found this shampoo.</li>
      <li>My daughter&#x27;s hair is really oily and we have tried so many different kinds of shampoo to fix the problem.  </li>
      <li>My dandruff has gone, shampoo smells delicious,does not have nasty chemicals on it and the best part is not damaging my hair at all, I LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>It really does help with the oil in my hair.</li>
      <li>very leaky container, product seeps out.  </li>
      <li>I have very oil hair.</li>

      <li>Which I am highly allergic to.  </li>
      <li>The shampoo is really runny, which  surprised me.</li>
      <li>I purchased this for my 15 year old son who has very oily hair.  </li>
      <li>After a few days I was able to use conditioner again and finally, after months of greasy, my hair felt and looked normal again!</li>
      <li>If only they would show the full ingredient&#x27;s prior to us buying.</li>
      <li>Hopefully, it can go back because I certainly can&#x27;t use it.</li>
      <li>This shampoo manages my oily hair and it&#x27;s natural.</li>
      <li>i have sensitive combination skin.</li>
      <li>Love the smell and the shine this product leaves behind.  </li>
      <li>If you have oily hair on which other shampoos work, I would not recommend this, but if you have very oily hair and are running out of products to try, look no further.</li>

<li> If you have oily hair on which other shampoos work, I would not recommend this, but if you have very oily hair and are running out of products to try, look no further.</li>
<li> it was literally pressed flat against my scalp and the Garnier shampoo</li>
<li> Not overly dry and not flat with oil.</li>
<li> I use it everyday and my hair looks fanatic and I love wearing it down now.</li>
<li> I was careful to use only a quarter-sized amount and work it through the hair and scalp.</li>
<li> I would wash it, scrub my scalp, not use conditioner or other products and it was still gross.</li>
<li> I have medium thickness, s-waves with an oily scalp and dry tips.</li>
<li> I have been using this instead of the green bottled (Paul Mitchell) one, which is way more expensive and this works just as well.</li>
<li> Left my hair feeling a little dry.</li>
<li> I will be replacing it when this bottle is empty.</li>
<li> A little goes a long way.</li>
<li> You can find it cheaper in other websites by the way</li>
<li> I was using head and shoulders for years due to problems with dandruff</li>
<li> With this shampoo/conditioner she can go 2-3 days without needing to wash her hair due to being oily.</li>
<li> We have a spectrum of hair types from blonde with thin strands to thick red to coarse brown hair.</li>
<li> But I wouldn&#x27;t use it for an everyday shampoo.</li>
<li> This isn&#x27;t a miracle worker--she still has oily hair by night time, but at least she can get through the day without it.</li>
<li> My only complaint is the packaging, I hate having to squeeze it out of this type of tube</li>
<li> I am so tired of getting a shampoo that makes me itch to death.</li>
<li> and I could not detect the tea tree scent at all, which I was a little disappointed by.</li>
<li> The smell is a very faint lemon-y tea smell.</li>
<li> The formulation avoids all ingredients that could be bad for your health and hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Bought this for my daughter&#x27;s oily hair problem. This is the ONLY shampoo and conditioner that I have found that cleans her hair, keeps it oil-free and smells amazing. She used to have to wash her hair every morning and it was still oily by the end of the day. With this shampoo/conditioner she can go 2-3 days without needing to wash her hair due to being oily. It has a strong lemon smell when you apply it but after rinsing the smell is much softer.</li>
    <li> This might be great for others, but for me it made the skin around me hairline breakout.  My hair felt really great, but it wasn&#x27;t worth the breakout.</li>
    <li> Seller shipped fairly quickly and product was packaged well. Product does not smell lemony but that is manufacturer&#x27;s fault.</li>
    <li> Smells great and is what I consider a deep cleanser.  Left my hair feeling a little dry. Definitely need to follow up with a deep conditioner following use.&lt;br /&gt;Also thought it smelled mostly of lemon and I could not detect the tea tree scent at all, which I was a little disappointed by.</li>
    <li> If you have greasy oily hair, this shampoo is great! After having my baby and hormone changes it seamed I could never get my hair clean after trying númerouse shampoos. I would wash it, scrub my scalp, not use conditioner or other products and it was still gross. After some research I stumbled upon a review for this shampoo. After just 1 wash I was oil free. After a few days I was able to use conditioner again and finally, after months of greasy, my hair felt and looked normal again!</li>
    <li> I have very oil hair. I cannot use conditioner and many brands of shampoo because of it. This shampoo manages my oily hair and it&#x27;s natural. Which is a bonus. Worth every penny. I&#x27;ve had this bottle for months and I&#x27;m still using it. I will be replacing it when this bottle is empty.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo and will buy again</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my 15 year old son who has very oily hair.  Best shampoo we have found for keeping his hair fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> By far my favorite shampoo. I have fine hair that can get oily, this stuff is great. My only complaint is the packaging, I hate having to squeeze it out of this type of tube &amp; I don&#x27;t get many uses out of it.</li>
    <li> My kids and I all use this. We have a spectrum of hair types from blonde with thin strands to thick red to coarse brown hair. We all look fabulous and smell great. A little goes a long way. The formulation avoids all ingredients that could be bad for your health and hair. Safe for Celiacs.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo along with many of their other products, it smells amazing and leaves my hair feeling so clean and soft, love all the natural ingredients</li>
    <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS SHAMPOO!  I was using head and shoulders for years due to problems with dandruff but my hair was so dry.Every time I tried to switch to a more gentle shampoo the dandruff came back until I found this shampoo. My dandruff has gone, shampoo smells delicious,does not have nasty chemicals on it and the best part is not damaging my hair at all, I LOVE IT! You can find it cheaper in other websites by the way…Sorry amazon</li>
    <li> I have oily hair that I would just tie-up and not deal with. This shampoo is great and I love it for my hair. I use it everyday and my hair looks fanatic and I love wearing it down now. It even has added volume and softness to my hair. I recommend this shampoo for anyone dealing with oily hair.</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is really oily and we have tried so many different kinds of shampoo to fix the problem.  This isn&#x27;t a miracle worker--she still has oily hair by night time, but at least she can get through the day without it.</li>
    <li> They NEED to list ALL of the ingredients in the shampoo or put a photo up that makes those ingredients readable. I cannot use palm oil. Sure enough, I got it today and palm oil is an ingredient. Hopefully, it can go back because I certainly can&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo for my daughter&#x27;s thin hair. Totally changed her hair from stringy mess to soft, full beautiful long hair. And I feel good because it is organic.</li>
    <li> EDIT: After using it for over 6 weeks, I regret to say that the hair on the crown of my head is matted with build-up. I recant my positive review and will have to keep looking for a good shampoo for oily hair.     I was using Garnier Fructis Volume shampoo to try and give life to my oily, matted hair...it was literally pressed flat against my scalp and the Garnier shampoo did nothing to help. I do not use any styling products except coconut oil on my tips and yet, only clarifying shampoo made my hair somewhat more manageable. I just bought this Desert Essence shampoo and I am impressed. I was careful to use only a quarter-sized amount and work it through the hair and scalp. It worked like a charm! Not overly dry and not flat with oil. The only downside is the smell...kind of like a light lemon pledge scent and plastic. Thankfully, it doesn&#x27;t linger at all.    I have medium thickness, s-waves with an oily scalp and dry tips. If you have oily hair on which other shampoos work, I would not recommend this, but if you have very oily hair and are running out of products to try, look no further.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair clean and with just a hint of fragrance.</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo and works well with my oily hair . It also smells really good!</li>
    <li> The problem I have with a lot of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; shampoo&#x27;s they contain coconut.  Which I am highly allergic to.  If only they would show the full ingredient&#x27;s prior to us buying. I gave it to my sister.  I am so tired of getting a shampoo that makes me itch to death.</li>
    <li> Love this brand and this particular one smells like you are washing your hair with a lemon chiffon pie.  it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> It was not as good as this aveeno (no sulfate) for all hair shampoo (seaweed) that I used, but it is ok-ish.</li>
    <li> very leaky container, product seeps out.  i had hoped that i could skip a day between washing my hair with this product, but no such luck.  i can only use this on the crown of my head. it&#x27;s too drying to the back and sides and caused itching/scabbing. i have sensitive combination skin.</li>
    <li> I love the shampoo and delivery was fast. The only thing, that the tube was damaged, it&#x27;s like a tiny puncture on the end of the tube, so every time I use it the liquid shampoo comes from 2 sides....</li>
    <li> Love the smell and the shine this product leaves behind.  I don&#x27;t have oily hair, but wanted to try the scent.  Lemon lingers in hair and makes it very shiny, nice product.</li>
    <li> Really like this organic shampoo! My hair looks and feels super healthy.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and it works great.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, but it doesn&#x27;t give my hair the body it needs.  Also it doesn&#x27;t seem to be good for not stripping color.  I love the lemon smell though.  I need something that doesn&#x27;t take my color away though because I don&#x27;t need seeing my gray hair!</li>
    <li> I have been using this instead of the green bottled (Paul Mitchell) one, which is way more expensive and this works just as well.</li>
    <li> Wow, best shampoo ever!</li>
    <li> This wonderful shampoo contains none of the stuff my husband is allergic to!  Shampoos without these allergens ard to find! Smells wonderful too!</li>
    <li> It really does help with the oil in my hair. I only use it when I know I won&#x27;t have time to shower the next day. The shampoo is really runny, which  surprised me. I love that it&#x27;s organic. The smell is a very faint lemon-y tea smell. Overall it does it&#x27;s job. But I wouldn&#x27;t use it for an everyday shampoo.</li>
