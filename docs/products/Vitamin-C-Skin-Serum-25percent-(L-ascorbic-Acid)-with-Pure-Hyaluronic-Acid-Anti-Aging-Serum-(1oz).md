      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>their serums are exemplary, but cost much more because of their clinical research and development, but they are proven to do exactly what they say they will.</li>
      <li>Arrived early and so far, so good!</li>
      <li>The reviewer, Olga, took the words right out of my mouth!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll continue till its gone and make my full assessment than.</li>
      <li>I love the reasonable prices for this vitamin c.  </li>
      <li>If you get three weeks use you are lucky.</li>
      <li>This item was received quickly and was packaged well.</li>
      <li>Use in combination with a strong sunblock, then you can really see the skin lightening.</li>
      <li>Came quickly and seemed fresh.  </li>
      <li>I have used just plain Vitamin C and found that to be more effective in meeting my needs.</li>
      <li>Good price and my skin needs all the help it can get as I live in the south and am outdoors daily.</li>
      <li>I was disappointed because it is a great product and very effective.</li>
      <li>It is ok but not exactly as i expected</li>
      <li>So far so good, I ve been using the serum everyday in hopes of seeing some result soon:-)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not just fine lines / wrinkles, I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I saw results after first trial, but it burned my skin.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a Vitamin C serum for your skin, you need to make sure the Vitamin C is in the form of L-Ascorbic acid, such as this one.</li>
      <li>This is my second bottle and I absolutely love how it changed my skin.</li>
      <li>It is a viscous, clear gel-liquid which goes on smoothly and has no smell.</li>
      <li>Seems ok, but every time I order this product the texture of the serum is different.</li>
      <li>I use a Vitamin C serum each morning under my sunscreen and makeup, and this product preforms pretty well.</li>
      <li>This product did not seem as effective as other vitamin c serums I have tried.</li>
      <li>I am using this serum for about  10 days and already my skin looks almost flawless (been having trouble with some sort of melasma), laugh lines less visible</li>
      <li>but I think it is as good as or better than products that I purchased that were 3 times as expensive.</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t know that this is really effective for fading dark spots.</li>
      <li>It is pure Ascorbic acid which is what Dr. Oz recommended.  </li>
      <li>It certainly seems like it is tighening your skin.  </li>
      <li>Pure potency and delivers everything it sets out to be.  </li>
      <li>i love that it comes in a small black drawstring bag to protect it from light, plastic sealed around the top and smells fresh.</li>
      <li>This product really works.  </li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t see much difference in my skin.  </li>
      <li>It has really helped brighten my complexion.</li>
      <li>I moved on to a hyaluronic face cream though, which I really do like.  </li>
      <li>I  have no desire to try the coveted skinceticuals vitamin c anymore thanks to this product.</li>
      <li>My face feels very moisturized when I use it.</li>
      <li>And use often, as you can tolerate so as not to throw too  much away.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m getting ready to order another bottle.  </li>
      <li>Really feel serum working on my face</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this product. Makes my skin feel nice and youthful</li>
    <li> Product was recommended to me by my electrologist.  I used the product for about 1 week before seeing her again and she saw a big difference in my skin.  I will recommend to my friends.</li>
    <li> This product has helped decrease lines on my face.  The lines around my mouth and eyes have smoothed out so much.  I&#x27;m getting ready to order another bottle.  I also started using the product on my arms and legs.  My skin appearance is definitely improving.  Since my iniatial review, I have ordered another bottle, the lines around my mouth are less visible, and I also use the serum on my arms, which has helped with clearing up some age spots.</li>
    <li> It shipped as described. Ordered one for myself and thought the product was great so I ordered one for a friend.</li>
    <li> Just be aware that the serum has to be kept in the dark, and cool, and therefore has a short shelf life. Once it changes color it is no good. Throw it out as it has lost its effectiveness. Probable best stored in cool drawer or refrigerator.  And use often, as you can tolerate so as not to throw too  much away. If you get three weeks use you are lucky.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Cellex-C for years but it&#x27;s expensive, so found this cheaper alternative and it had mostly good reviews. I&#x27;m actually doubting the validity of this product now. It doesn&#x27;t even tingle my skin; whereas I&#x27;ve always had some initial stinging or tingling with other C products. Nor does it seem to oxidize! I&#x27;ve left out several test drops and yet after a couple of days  the serum drops are still clear. For having 25% L-ascorbic acid, I should be feeling and at least seeing something. And yet, nothing.  Now I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;ve just bought a bottle of liquid silicone.</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s a simple comment on ingredients: the bottle lists &amp;#34;Optiphen&amp;#34; as the third ingredient, which is not listed on the website. It&#x27;s a preservative which earned a score of 5 from EWG (Environmental Working Group).  Not happy.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle and I could not be happier with the results.  My skin is clearer smoother and more even toned.  I like the fact that when I first put it on my face it tingled a little bit that is how I know it will work.  With continued use the tingling does go away but the product is still working.  I love the reasonable prices for this vitamin c.  I  have no desire to try the coveted skinceticuals vitamin c anymore thanks to this product.</li>
    <li> arrived WAY ahead of the delivery estimate, i&#x27;m so happy i don&#x27;t have to wait another 4 days. i love that it comes in a small black drawstring bag to protect it from light, plastic sealed around the top and smells fresh.</li>
    <li> This product actually works! I could tell a difference in my skin within a couple weeks.</li>
    <li> Just so-so for me.  I didn&#x27;t see the results of everyone else.  And, the liquid started turning yellow shortly after opening.  Vitamin C is unstable and starts to turn yellow when it loses its zip.  Mine started turning almost immediately, even though I kept it closed tightly and in the dark pouch provided.  I&#x27;m glad everyone else liked it, not me though.  I moved on to a hyaluronic face cream though, which I really do like.  Good luck to everyone.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle and I absolutely love how it changed my skin. It is magic in this little bottle!</li>
    <li> So far so good, I ve been using the serum everyday in hopes of seeing some result soon:-)</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying this product. I try and use it twice a day and have had very good results. Using this in conjunction with a 2% BHA as well as a hyaluronic acid vit c product, my skin is much less red and dry, my complexion is smoother and I just look healthier all around. It lasts a while because it takes so little to saturate your face. Definitely recommend this and will be purchasing it when my current stock runs out</li>
    <li> Love it!  I&#x27;ve been using this serum for about 1 month now and I really like what it has done to my skin.  It is pure Ascorbic acid which is what Dr. Oz recommended.  I use it at night and when it dries I use my night moisturizer.  It has made my skin very smooth and has  a youthful glow.  I&#x27;m not sure if it has helped much with tightening of my skin but maybe I need to give it more time.  I definitely recommend this serum.</li>
    <li> Skin looked younger and healthier</li>
    <li> I loved it, but a little runny and messy. Next time, I will purchase HA separately.</li>
    <li> Saw this on Dr. Oz show and decided to try it out.  So far I believe it is working.  It certainly seems like it is tighening your skin.  It wa noted that it might be a few months until you can be sure but in just three weeks I believe there is a difference.  I&#x27;ll continue till its gone and make my full assessment than.</li>
    <li> The fading of age spots is slow, but it is working and I have noticed a fading. I would recommend for the those not in a hurry for results. My skin is smoother, even on my hands.</li>
    <li> I have only used this for about 3 weeks but I think it is as good as or better than products that I purchased that were 3 times as expensive.</li>
    <li> the product was just what I was looking for and a bit cheaper than others that I had looked at</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry!  I wrote a bad review of this product not realizing it was not the one I hated!  My apologies to the company.  Please disregard my previous review.  This one I liked and was effective on my 55+ skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It works!  I can see a definite difference in my skin tone, texture and smoothness and less visible brown spots.</li>
    <li> This product really works.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year and will continue to use it because I see results.</li>
    <li> I have bought this item twice and it has been great.  It has really helped brighten my complexion. You need to be careful when taking the dropper in and out of the bottle otherwise the serum will be running down the outside of the bottle.  This item was received quickly and was packaged well.</li>
    <li> I am happy with this product and have purchased it twice now. I love the fact that it comes in that little velvet pouch which reminds me to store it at night. It does dry your skin some so I would recommend using a light moisturizing cream along with it and a sunscreen everyday. I just started using it with my new derma roller. Hoping the combo will help with wrinkles and those little brown spots on my face. I took away one star only because the bottle was so hard to open and a little hard to shut. I do like the dropper it comes with and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost two months and so far I do not see any improvement yet.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hoping it would help with the fading of several dark spots on my face due to breakouts. So far, I&#x27;m not seeing any real results. I&#x27;ve used it for about a month now. I&#x27;ll continue to use it since it&#x27;s not really causing any problems but I don&#x27;t know that this is really effective for fading dark spots. I am also using prescription hydroquinone so it could just be my problem skin.</li>
    <li> after about a week with this product I could see the difference in my skin. thank you JJ labs and other reviewers .</li>
    <li> For the money really great. Works very good</li>
    <li> The reviewer, Olga, took the words right out of my mouth! The first bottle&#x27;s serum was more liquidy...and reminded me of expensive brand name Vitamin C serums I&#x27;ve used. I recently purchased a second bottle, and the consistency is very thick. I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times, because it left my face so greasy looking!</li>
    <li> I use this serum overnight and wake up with great looking skin.  It seems lighter with more even tone.  I recommend using every other night or 2-3 times a week, because the skin does become more sensitive after frequent use.  Also, the overall effects are subtle, you need to use it for a few weeks to notice a difference.  Use in combination with a strong sunblock, then you can really see the skin lightening.</li>
    <li> this is good stuff it dose what it claims no problems to tell i will buy it again thank you</li>
    <li> Good price and my skin needs all the help it can get as I live in the south and am outdoors daily.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time and as described. I would reccomend this product to others. It has lightened dark spots and evened skin tone.</li>
    <li> I am using this serum for about  10 days and already my skin looks almost flawless (been having trouble with some sort of melasma), laugh lines less visible, also I&#x27;ve noticed that the black heads on nose are gone.So far so good.</li>
    <li> No difference what so ever,..very disappointed in it. :( Would not recommend or use again. To bad it didnt work..</li>
    <li> I have been using the Vitamin C along with the Retinol Cream for several weeks.  My skin looks great.  It is less expensive than all the many other products that I have purchased over the years.  I have recently  had several people ask me what I use on my skin-- so it must be making a difference!</li>
    <li> IMPORTANT! If you are looking for a Vitamin C serum for your skin, you need to make sure the Vitamin C is in the form of L-Ascorbic acid, such as this one. It is the only one that can be absorbed by your skin. Its a shame that other companies will make promises they cant keep. The skincare company skinceuticals has done a lot of research on the topic. their serums are exemplary, but cost much more because of their clinical research and development, but they are proven to do exactly what they say they will. This one is far cheaper than most and uses the best and simplest ingredients.</li>
    <li> This product did not seem as effective as other vitamin c serums I have tried. As always though, it was delivered on time and in good condition.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a little over a year now and have tried many other brands, (some less, some more expensive), and I always come back to this particular one. It&#x27;s not just fine lines / wrinkles, I have very sensitive skin and it seems the least little thing will irritate my face. Before using the vitamin c serum by JJ, I would even have issues with my skin breaking out like a teenager once a month, even tho I am WELL past that age. This vitamin c serum has made my skin more even, brighter, and don&#x27;t hardly wear any makeup at all. I know everyone is different, but this one works for me. I would definitely give it a try, especially if you have sensitive skin. A HUGE thank you to JJ Labs!</li>
    <li> It is ok but not exactly as i expected</li>
    <li> Love this product!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Tried others but this is the best!</li>
    <li> Delivery was fine but I don&#x27;t see much difference in my skin.  It&#x27;s only been 2 weeks.  Maybe I will see a difference in time</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I am a long time vitamin c serum user and tried tons of other brands. This one was affordable and lasts me for 2 and half months without turning brown. I got my skin tightened and fine lines diminished and disappeared some if them. I would definitely buy it again and recommended it to everyone.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! My skin looks so clear,  not to mention that it has improved the wrinkles on my forehead around my eyes and mouth.  Love the product! will purchase again.</li>
    <li> The product was okay. I am not for sure about ordering it again. I have used just plain Vitamin C and found that to be more effective in meeting my needs.</li>
    <li> Arrived early and so far, so good!</li>
    <li> I just got it I love it</li>
    <li> Really feel serum working on my face</li>
    <li> I just reordered this one and liked it alot. There are too many words required and the reason I never fill these out. Who has time for all this?</li>
    <li> It worked so well.  I bought more.  It is especially good after exfoliating skin.  It may sting a little, but it heals the skin well.  Would highlyrecommend this product.</li>
    <li> I DID NOT LIKE THIS AT ALL MADE MY SKIN FEEL DRY DOES NOT COMPAIR TO SKIN CEUTICALS  CE NOT EVEN CLOSE</li>
    <li> An extraordinary item with fabulous results!</li>
    <li> I use it morning and at night a few drops. I can see a bit of a difference it give you a glow. Didnt work on the dark spots on the face, but I&#x27;ve only used it for 3 weeks, maybe I need to wait. But overall I saw its a good buy and not that expensive.</li>
    <li> This is a much thicker Vitamin C serum than I&#x27;ve used in the past. It also feels a bit stronger than the 20% solutions. It is a viscous, clear gel-liquid which goes on smoothly and has no smell. I use a Vitamin C serum each morning under my sunscreen and makeup, and this product preforms pretty well. I can tell it is helping keep my skin clear and bright. The hyaluronic acid helps with skin hydration, so if you find other vit c serums too drying, this might be a better option. I would recommend you give this product a try.</li>
    <li> Good quality, vitamin c really works</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a month now. I have noticed that so fine lines around my eyes have started to diminish already!</li>
    <li> I like this product so  far.though  I have&#x27;t used it long enough to see the benefits.  My face feels very moisturized when I use it.</li>
    <li> LOVE it.  I used another products but came kept coming  back to Vitamin C Skin Serum.  It is the best.  I will only buy this product.</li>
    <li> I really liked this more than I was expecting!!</li>
    <li> Seems ok, but every time I order this product the texture of the serum is different. Either it&#x27;s liquid like watery and yellowish in color, then next time I order it its a thick liquid serum and clear in color.. It&#x27;s weird cause it&#x27;s the same maker do im question if I Will order again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this in conjunction with hyaluronic acid serum. After an outbreak of whiteheads all over my face, using both of them together has cleared 90% of them in just a few weeks! This is absolutely amazing I will continue using them, because it seems to plump my skin as well.</li>
    <li> Mix this with Bio-oil. Great.</li>
    <li> Love this.. can not believe I did not know about this product..</li>
    <li> Excellent product and fast service</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Pure potency and delivers everything it sets out to be.  Plumps the skin and is moisturizing as well.  Use it morning and night.  Best results are achieved in 2-4 weeks along with taking 2 capsules of Phytoceramides 350 mg twice a day.</li>
    <li> Love it. Works great.</li>
    <li> Did not notice any difference and would not purchase agbain.</li>
    <li> Does not absorb into the skin</li>
    <li> The product has seemed to make a difference in my skin and I&#x27;ve only used one bottle. I am ordering more!</li>
    <li> It was very strong, and effective. However, I am a redhead, with delicate skin and it was to strong for me.  I saw results after first trial, but it burned my skin.I was disappointed because it is a great product and very effective. It was just too strong for me.</li>
    <li> Came quickly and seemed fresh.  Cannot say I noticed a big difference in my skin.</li>
