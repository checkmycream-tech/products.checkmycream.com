      <li>I love itl</li>
      <li>I got to sample this product for free on Influenster!</li>

      <li>I really love this foundation.</li>
      <li>Very light weight and easy to apply.</li>
      <li>I really loved this foundation, I always felt the foundation I had been using made my face look very oily</li>
      <li>It matched my skin tone beautifully, I would definitely recommend this to a friend!</li>
      <li>Not for me, it cakes into the fine lines.</li>
      <li>so I typically stay away from matte foundations, but after seeing some awesome reviews for this I decided to give it a try.</li>
      <li>but this really helps to make my face looks beautifully smooth!!</li>
      <li>I received this foundation free from influenster for testing purposes</li>
      <li>fit my skin</li>
      <li>Not only does it give great coverage</li>
      <li>It goes on so light and smooth</li>
      <li>and it did great at keeping a lasting matte finish all day.</li>
      <li>Totally worth it!</li>
      <li>so this product feels very light on the skin but is very well pigmented and can be layered.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really have many blemishes on my skin</li>
      <li>So I received the Covergirl ready set gorgeous through Influenster for testing purposes only, and I must say I&#x27;m glad I was chosen to try this foundation out because if they didn&#x27;t, then I probably wouldn&#x27;t have tried it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it did a great job cover mild pink zones on my face</li>
      <li>I love the blend ability of this product and how decent the coverage is.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the first foundation to not make my skin super oily and it matched my skin tone PERFECTLY, which is a hard task to accomplish.</li>
      <li>Blends well, the only downside really is that it kind of smells strongly.</li>
      <li>I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
      <li>I got this product free for testing purposes in my Voxbox last week and I&#x27;m in love.</li>
      <li>I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
      <li>I received this liquid foundation from Influenster a few weeks ago and I love it!!</li>
      <li>right.</li>
      <li>I was very lucky enough to recieve this product free from Influenster.com for testing purposes.</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and looks very natural.</li>
      <li>Thanks Influenster!</li>
      <li>It has a medium, matte coverage, which feels soft and light.</li>
      <li>(I really have youthful-looking skin with only very fine wrinkles, so there is an upside).</li>
      <li>It stays matte even with 100 degree weather in Southern California and blends easily.</li>
      <li>It is definitely build able but it looks very natural.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very light with a natural matte finish that last ALL day!</li>
      <li>It also is very affordable.</li>
      <li>this was very Liquidy</li>
      <li>It is very lightweight and breath-able, like you aren&#x27;t wearing anything at all.</li>
      <li>this is a very lightweight foundation</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product to someone who wants something new in their life.</li>
      <li>It did make my face shiny and oily after a few hours but most makeup does that to me.</li>
      <li>it is my new go to foundation.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a full-coverage, lightweight, barely there foundation.</li>
      <li>I am pleasantly surprised by this foundation and it has made me reconsider liquid foundations.</li>
      <li>I am 48 years old and have been plagued by oily skin all my life.  </li>
      <li>I like it way better than my amazonian clay liquid foundation from Tarte because this one doesn&#x27;t cake up if you apply a little more than usual, and it doesn&#x27;t over dry my skin while still giving me a matte finish.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different oil fee foundations and I really like the coverage of this one.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very watery in texture and not very buildable</li>
      <li>although it does have a slight scent it is pleasant and not over powering just smells a little like olay moisturizer but again not overwhelmingly.</li>

<li> got this free through Influenster and will be using this over Victoria Secret!</li>
<li> I normally am use to buying such expensive make up but this did the job with no streaks, no uneven skin tone, no caking of the face, and fills in just about any line on my face.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t need to use a powder of it like all my others, and it lasts quite a long time!</li>
<li> I have dry skin</li>
<li> but it wont fully cover under-eye if too dark or bigger blemishes on face.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of drugstore foundations usually, as I have oily, acne prone skin, but this one actually works for me.</li>
<li> Unlike other liquid foundations that I have tried, this does not leave that &#x27;caked on&#x27; feeling.</li>
<li> I had a blemish the other day</li>
<li> My face has been very dry lately without proper moisturizer</li>
<li> and you really cannot go wrong with the price.</li>
<li> My only complaint is the coverage.</li>
<li> It didn&#x27;t cake up around my nose, where most foundations seem to just blend horribly around my nose.</li>
<li> I usually don&#x27;t like liquid foundations.</li>
<li> I have a really hard time finding foundations that won&#x27;t make me break out and stay on because I have oily skin</li>

    <li> Bought it for my wife and she loves it</li>
    <li> I have dry skin so I typically stay away from matte foundations, but after seeing some awesome reviews for this I decided to give it a try. I&#x27;m so glad I did. Not only does it give great coverage, it blends beautifully, and lasts all day. It didn&#x27;t cake up around my nose, where most foundations seem to just blend horribly around my nose. Great affordable foundation.</li>
    <li> I really love this foundation.  I am 48 years old and have been plagued by oily skin all my life.  (I really have youthful-looking skin with only very fine wrinkles, so there is an upside). I&#x27;ve tried several different oil fee foundations and I really like the coverage of this one.  It is cheaper than Neutrogena and lasts the entire day.  It has a medium, matte coverage, which feels soft and light.</li>
    <li> I received this product for free to try from Influenster! I don&#x27;t wear face makeup often, only on my eyes. However, I liked this. It did make my face shiny and oily after a few hours but most makeup does that to me. It goes on smoothly and looks very natural. Overall I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! It&#x27;s very light with a natural matte finish that last ALL day!</li>

    <li> Received this in my Deans list VoxBox by influenster. My face has been very dry lately without proper moisturizer my favorite Rimmle London foundation looks like a catastrophe. I needed something smoother. this was very Liquidy but it applied evenly and was great for blending out this is a very lightweight foundation but it gave me medium coverage. it did a great job cover mild pink zones on my face but it wont fully cover under-eye if too dark or bigger blemishes on face. this has the feeling of a tinted moisturizer but with more coverage and no sunscreeny smell. although it does have a slight scent it is pleasant and not over powering just smells a little like olay moisturizer but again not overwhelmingly. Will repurchase :)</li>
    <li> Best foundation! It blends in great with my skin tone and does not look spotty. Buy it!</li>
    <li> I got this product free for testing purposes in my Voxbox last week and I&#x27;m in love. It&#x27;s the first foundation to not make my skin super oily and it matched my skin tone PERFECTLY, which is a hard task to accomplish. I&#x27;m definitely hooked on it. It&#x27;s become a part of my every day beauty routine. 5/5 for sure!:)</li>
    <li> This is the best foundation by covergirl so far. I love itl</li>
    <li> Blends well, the only downside really is that it kind of smells strongly.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this foundation. I have a really hard time finding foundations that won&#x27;t make me break out and stay on because I have oily skin and this is great. It stays matte even with 100 degree weather in Southern California and blends easily.</li>
    <li> I really love this product! I have oily skin and this foundation does wonders.. I honestly feel like I have nothing on my skin while using this product. it is my new go to foundation. definitely my new favorite!!!</li>
    <li> I got to sample this product for free on Influenster! Not going to lie I didn&#x27;t think I was going to like it because I&#x27;m not a big covergirl fan but I was wrong! Totally worth it!</li>
    <li> I really love this foundation. It is great on oily skin and lasts all day. I would definitely recommend this foundation to people with oily or combination skin. I tend to have an oily T-zone and it did great at keeping a lasting matte finish all day. It&#x27;s very easy to put on and not cake at all. Great coverage without looking like a pancake.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t care for the color, way too orangey. Not for me, it cakes into the fine lines.</li>
    <li> Awesome Product!  got this free through Influenster and will be using this over Victoria Secret! Goes to show that you can have the glam without the ridiculous price! It goes on so light and smooth that I never even notice it&#x27;s there.</li>
    <li> I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. I really loved this foundation, I always felt the foundation I had been using made my face look very oily and I couldn&#x27;t find a good brand that I felt fit my skin right. Now I don&#x27;t have to look any further! It matched my skin tone beautifully, I would definitely recommend this to a friend!</li>
    <li> This foundation is gorgeous. Very light weight and easy to apply. It also is very affordable. This is definetly a plus !!!</li>
    <li> I love the blend ability of this product and how decent the coverage is. It is definitely build able but it looks very natural.</li>
    <li> I received this foundation free from influenster for testing purposes and I honestly didn&#x27;t think it would be so nice. I like it way better than my amazonian clay liquid foundation from Tarte because this one doesn&#x27;t cake up if you apply a little more than usual, and it doesn&#x27;t over dry my skin while still giving me a matte finish. In loveee.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! I usually don&#x27;t like liquid foundations. I have used the same matte formula foundation for 10 years. But ever since receiving this foundation from Influenster, I have put the matte down!!! Unlike other liquid foundations that I have tried, this does not leave that &#x27;caked on&#x27; feeling. It is very lightweight and breath-able, like you aren&#x27;t wearing anything at all. I am pleasantly surprised by this foundation and it has made me reconsider liquid foundations. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a full-coverage, lightweight, barely there foundation.</li>
    <li> I received this liquid foundation from Influenster a few weeks ago and I love it!! I don&#x27;t really have many blemishes on my skin but this really helps to make my face looks beautifully smooth!!</li>
    <li> So I received the Covergirl ready set gorgeous through Influenster for testing purposes only, and I must say I&#x27;m glad I was chosen to try this foundation out because if they didn&#x27;t, then I probably wouldn&#x27;t have tried it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay so this product feels very light on the skin but is very well pigmented and can be layered. I had a blemish the other day and it actually covered it up quite well to where I forgot that I even had a pimple to begin with!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stay power is about 8 hours but when applied with the powder, it stays a good 12 hours for me. I would recommend this product to someone who wants something new in their life. Thanks Influenster!</li>
    <li> I actually really liked this foundation. I&#x27;m not a big fan of drugstore foundations usually, as I have oily, acne prone skin, but this one actually works for me. It matched my skin tone beautifully. My only complaint is the coverage. It&#x27;s very watery in texture and not very buildable so I had to use a lot of concealer and powder on top. But overall it&#x27;s the best drugstore foundation I&#x27;ve tried and you really cannot go wrong with the price. I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
