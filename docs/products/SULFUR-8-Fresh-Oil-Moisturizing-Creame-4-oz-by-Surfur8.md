    <li> My scalp was in great need of some moisturizer because it was dry and itchy. This moisturizer works like a charm if used on a regular basis. It makes my scalp cool and it feels refreshing. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the size of the jar. I can get it in my local area for about 8 bucks. However, having to use it so much makes it go fast. I need to buy this in bulk.</li>
    <li> It smells a lot better than the old formula and is much lighter.  It makes my scalp tingle.</li>
    <li> not what i expected. did not keep my hair moisturized. dried up really fast.</li>
    <li> This product is truly outstanding and I have seen it over the last few weeks that my 57 year old hair is actually growing. Added benefit is that it does not smell like the old suffer a product.</li>
    <li> I am not used to putting stuff in my hair, but on weekends or in the evening you can use this and it really helps manage my hair.  Keeps it from being dry and flyaway.</li>
    <li> Pachage arrived with cap off the jar and creme all over the inside of the box. The little left in the jar did a good job but company refused to replace the jar since I couldn&#x27;t send them a picture of the package..I am 81 and VERY technically&lt;br /&gt;inept. I just don&#x27;t know how to do such stuff.</li>
    <li> Sulfur8 moisturizing creme worked as advertised.after application to my scalp and leaving product in for an hour ,affected area was improved .continued to apply product daily for five days and problem disappeared.good for healing damaged scalp</li>
    <li> Was somewhat disappointed with it.  The scent was very faint.  I purchased a jar from a local store that has a stronger scent of sulfur.&lt;br /&gt;More concentrated.  What my mother used to use.</li>
    <li> Its like magic use regularly and never see a flake again...was glad when I found it here because it wasn&#x27;t available in any local drugstore for awhile</li>
    <li> This particular moisturizer is not sold in my area.  Hard to find but now that I know about it and where to purchase will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Has bleach in it. Stinks. Misleading advertising. Nothing natural or safe about it. burns skin and broke out w a rash. Lied and refused to refund me.</li>
    <li> My scalp and hair feel pampered, I wish I had known about this sooner.I recommend this product if you have damaged hair or itchy scalp.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years, it can be difficult to find locally, the price is reasonable</li>

    <li> Simple review, the product is a consumable, but impossible to find the ingredients, after the product is received, I do not like some of the ingredients that the product contains and the back it goes.  Waste of time, effort, and money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISPLAY THE INGREDIENTS!</li>
