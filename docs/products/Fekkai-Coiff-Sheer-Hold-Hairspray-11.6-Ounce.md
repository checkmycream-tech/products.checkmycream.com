<li> Unbelievably, this is actually worth every penny it costs.  </li>
<li> It holds very well, and it doesn&#x27;t look like your hair is stiff.</li>
<li> Fekkai Sheer Hold is nearly undetectable yet it holds just as well (and often better) than the less expensive sprays through wind and humidity.  </li>
<li> this is the only spray I use,  My hair doesn&#x27;t look oily the 2nd day or feel stiff after I spray on.</li>
<li> leaves NO residue, does not weigh hair down and holds up in the humidity.</li>
<li> The only complaint is that it is a little pricy.</li>
<li> Fekkai changed the scent of the hairspray, so I was looking for the previous version.  </li>
<li> This line is a waste of money</li>
<li> While some of the less expensive hairsprays held their shape through wind and humidity, they always remained crisp and unpleasant to touch.  </li>
<li> I have thin, limp hair but this spray holds well for me.</li>
<li> My 4th grader used it as the basis for a school science experiment:  less expensive, over-the-counter brands of hairspray -vs- this expensive, special-order hairspray.  </li>
<li> Expensive spray if bought at retail.</li>

    <li> The can came with a well cushioned Packge. The product meet my expectations. The only complaint is that it is a little pricy.</li>
    <li> Strong hold, great smell. I&#x27;m just starting to use hair products so my experience might not be the best to go off of.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hairspray. This can is HUGE, and will last me a long time! The hairspray itself is one I have used for years, it smells great, and is a lightweight, not hard hairspray. It holds very well, and it doesn&#x27;t look like your hair is stiff.</li>
    <li> Unbelievably, this is actually worth every penny it costs.  My 4th grader used it as the basis for a school science experiment:  less expensive, over-the-counter brands of hairspray -vs- this expensive, special-order hairspray.  While some of the less expensive hairsprays held their shape through wind and humidity, they always remained crisp and unpleasant to touch.  Fekkai Sheer Hold is nearly undetectable yet it holds just as well (and often better) than the less expensive sprays through wind and humidity.  It also smells like honeysuckle ... wonderful!  As a result of my 4th grader&#x27;s science experiments, we are keeping on this on hand and have thrown away all the others.  It&#x27;s definitely worth the money to not have cardboard hair!</li>
    <li> Bought the entire collection to try on my very fine limp hair. A big flop. Trying living proof full line instead. This line is a waste of money</li>
    <li> I have been using Fekkai hair products for a number of years, none better, Once you use it you will never change.</li>
    <li> Outstanding product, Holds hair without looking like it&#x27;s sprayed.  Adds shine and sheen to hair.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had a haircut or color in over a year and I attribute it all to the Fekkai products,  the shampoo and hairspray are amazing!!!!</li>
    <li> I Iove this hair spray. Ii is a light, strong hold and can still re-curl the next day if you need to.</li>
    <li> Fekkai changed the scent of the hairspray, so I was looking for the previous version.  Best soft hold with memory, and lovely fragrance that doesn&#x27;t give me headaches.</li>
    <li> There is no other hairspray that compares to Fekkai.  I love it and have been using it for 5 years.</li>
    <li> Loved it!! Great product I use it all the time!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this brand of spray for years and I keep coming back. Love it because it is lightweight and not sticky. You can brush your hair with no problem.</li>
    <li> Best hairspray holds all day, hair is not stiff and is touchable</li>
    <li> This hairspray is great, Strong hold but then Flexble.. Its hard to find in stores though, My clients love it</li>
    <li> Really like it it&#x27;s light and smells nice tried many others that do not allow you to brush your hair out after you spray on&lt;br /&gt;This product let you brush after use</li>
    <li> this is the only spray I use,  My hair doesn&#x27;t look oily the 2nd day or feel stiff after I spray on.</li>
    <li> This is a very good hairspray for me.  I am allergic to almost everything but I love this one.  I have thin, limp hair but this spray holds well for me.</li>
    <li> Best spray on the market</li>
    <li> Expensive spray if bought at retail. But this is a great product and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp.</li>
    <li> excellent product worth the extra $</li>
    <li> Light feeling &amp; great hold!</li>
    <li> recommended by friends.My hair has improved with this hair product. Worth the money.Last along time. My hair has stopped falling out since using this product.</li>
    <li> The very best hairspray made, ever!!!!!</li>
    <li> The odor is horrid.  The best I can say about it is that it holds--but too strongly.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> This hair spray has a nice sheer hold for my hair style.&lt;br /&gt; This spray  does not  leave any stiffness and your hairstyle always holds well.  Always  has a&lt;br /&gt; natural look.  Many hairsprays are sticky  makes it difficulty to handle the hair.</li>
    <li> This is the gold standard for hair spray. You just cannot get a better, cleaner spray on the market.</li>
    <li> I have worked in the hair care industry and on fashion photo shoots with stylists. This is THE BEST hairspray I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves NO residue, does not weigh hair down and holds up in the humidity. It smells wonderful too! The only downfall is the cost - but it is worth it!</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray for the sheer fact that it goes on light, but has a great hold.  I think it is the best hairspray out there.  The store was very fast and courteous in their getting this to me expeditiously.  Thank you</li>
