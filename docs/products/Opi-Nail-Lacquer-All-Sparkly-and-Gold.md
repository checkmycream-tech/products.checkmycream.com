<li> Not a long wait for merchandise</li>

<li> long lasting wear!</li>
<li> so I guess that&#x27;s why it lasts so long</li>
<li> It&#x27;s sparkly and eye-catching but the sparkles are small enough that two coats totally covers the nail.</li>
<li> I kept it and only used a little on the brush</li>
<li> Only negative is that it tends to flake after a bit.</li>
<li> the color of sparkles, the dark coloring, the shine.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s definitely a darker, subtle gold.</li>
<li> But, unfortunately, doesn&#x27;t stay on for very long.</li>
<li> I have one small chip!</li>
<li> I have false nails</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My favorite holiday polish on my accent nail. It&#x27;s a pain to get off but lasts on my nails forever!</li>
    <li> I was wondering how many coats it was gonna take to make it look good and gold, only 2!  Love this brand.</li>
    <li> Try this over &amp;#34;Rollin in Cashmere&amp;#34; for the prettiest luxe gold look you&#x27;ll ever see.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite shade, looks amazing on chocolate girls. NEED top coat for the full effect.</li>
    <li> Love the look. Gets lots of compliments. But, unfortunately, doesn&#x27;t stay on for very long. I&#x27;ll try it next time with a protective polish on top.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this color, and the shipping was super fast!</li>
    <li> I gave this nail polish four out of five stars because I haven&#x27;t worn it yet. But it looks pretty in the bottle.</li>
    <li> When I wear it and look at my nails it makes me feel happy and glamorous.  Only negative is that it tends to flake after a bit.</li>
    <li> The polish is exactly as it was described and was delivered within a reasonable amount of time. I got compliments from the lady who did my pedicure and get compliments from most others who look at my pretty toes!</li>
    <li> I actually bought &amp;#34;My Favorite Ornament&amp;#34;, not &amp;#34;All Sparkly and Gold&amp;#34; as this review says. LOVE the color. Saw it on a nail blog and knew I had to get it right away. Such a solid, dazzling polish without being too over the top or bright! Definitely my choice for the holidays now.</li>
    <li> I purchased All Sparkly and Gold. So sparkly! Great holiday color especially for New Years Eve! The glitter is really dense so I didn&#x27;t have to apply a second coat. I painted my nails on Dec. 23rd ... it&#x27;s the 28th I have one small chip!</li>
    <li> JUST THE RIGHT TOUCH FOR ANY SPECIAL OCCASION.  iT&#x27;S NOT OVER THE TOP, YET LOOKS NICE COMBINMED WITH SOME OTHER COLOR.</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish! It&#x27;s definitely a darker, subtle gold. I usually don&#x27;t like the yellow-ish looking gold and this one is definitely a true gold. If you like a hint of shimmer, then a coat or two should be fine. However, I usually put 3 to 4 coats just to get a very shimmery look.</li>
    <li> the color of sparkles, the dark coloring, the shine. long lasting wear! that&#x27;s the best. great for all occasions and I&#x27;ve received many compliments for this product. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Not a long wait for merchandise</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this gold color it will sparkle and add that glittery touch. Great holiday sparkly nailpolish</li>
    <li> Excellent color, hard to remove as with all glitter polish but I love the color. Great for parties and holidays</li>
    <li> SO PRETTY! My nails look exactly like the gold glittery ornaments I put on my Christmas tree :)</li>
    <li> Love the color and OPI products!</li>
    <li> Beautiful and sparkly. Perfect for New Years. I may need to buy another bottle of this polish! It&#x27;s a must have.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of this polish. It&#x27;s sparkly and eye-catching but the sparkles are small enough that two coats totally covers the nail. It is a little rough, though, so prepare to use a top coat and to need a little elbow grease to remove it.</li>
    <li> I love these polishes! They are the perfect consistency and cover the nail evenly and smoothly the first time, every time.</li>
    <li> Absolutely loved it!!  It is a great color.  I love OPI.  I am really glad I got this color.  I highly recommend OPI.</li>
    <li> I got this polish after viewing a neat manicure idea on Pinterest. I put this color on the edge of the nail with Warm Me Up and Matte (over Warm Me Up) for a festive holiday look. The only complaint is that glitter nail polish is not as easy to remove. I found a method that works well (remover on cotton balls, secured by tin foil).</li>
    <li> The color is absolutely amazing and I love it so much. I have false nails so I guess that&#x27;s why it lasts so long but I&#x27;ve been wearing it for over 3 weeks with no chips. Look good as new! I love OPI&#x27;s brush it&#x27;s really one of the best things about it. Very nice formula I just love it and highly recommend. It&#x27;s a perfect gold, not too bronze or yellow. My photo is very true to the actual color.</li>
    <li> I thought the color was much lighter than what I received. I kept it and only used a little on the brush so it looked very nice.&lt;br /&gt;The polish is definitely very sparkly.</li>
    <li> Love the quality and the gold glitter in this polish.  I also bought the matching gel color.  My 6 year old granddaughter also loves it!</li>
    <li> Love it. Super easy to put on and get off, looks just like the picture and even better on your nails! It even arrived early, pleasant surprise :D</li>
    <li> Beautiful with bronze tanned skin</li>
