    <li> After being happy with another Goody hair product, I bought these on a whim. I wish I didn&#x27;t. They seem flimsy and breakable. I have wavy hair that seems to have met an egg beater, especially when I towel dry my hair and these couldn&#x27;t curtail my rowdy bangs. They invariably end up slipping. Plus, another issue is that I think it&#x27;s a health hazard in terms of risking  injuring your thumb upon opening it. The plastic on the back seems to have ragged edges.  Not recommended.</li>
    <li> Hold my 5 year old daughters&#x27; hair securely in place! Among the best hair clips I&#x27;ve bought. Great quality!</li>
    <li> So adorable and well made.</li>
    <li> lots of colors to go with everything.  Inexpensive and easy to use</li>
    <li> Just so-so Not much to say if these clips are just the plain old, same old thing as in the stores</li>
    <li> Quality is okay not great. Holds hair well but the plastic top has a cheap feel to it. Importantly it is available at half that cost at my local Walmart (less than $4) ....will not buy this here again.</li>
    <li> Both of my girls wear the Goody Girl&#x27;s Barrettes almost every day. They are now ages 7 &amp; 10 and have been wearing them since Kindergarten. These are the BEST barrettes we have ever purchased!  (and I&#x27;ve purchased a lot of different brands and styles!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros:&lt;br /&gt;* Cute classic colors&lt;br /&gt;* Nice generic print that will compliment any outfit&lt;br /&gt;* Great quality - solid, not flimsy, doesn&#x27;t bend or come apart&lt;br /&gt;* Doesn&#x27;t break hair&lt;br /&gt;* Doesn&#x27;t slip - Works with all hair types (curly, fine or thick)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am buying another pack today on Amazon because I can&#x27;t find them locally anymore.</li>
    <li> My daughter (2.5 years old) has a lot of hair.  We ran out of clips so I went on amazon and got a lot different kinds of clips.  My wife did give me props for these being really cute, but that&#x27;s the only good thing.  The bad is that they don&#x27;t hold the hair that much.  I guess they aren&#x27;t worse that most clips out there but we wanted something that really held the hair.  My wife (not me) thought bangs would be a good idea and now we are trying to grow them out on my 2.5 year old.  Her hair is more than half way down her back so she has a lot of hair for her age and we were looking for something to keep her hair from falling in her face.  These didn&#x27;t do very well compared to some of the others we got.  The Goody Colour Contur Clips Blone are the best so far.  The ones I got were a little bigger than expected, but do a great job of holding hair and don&#x27;t get lost as easy.</li>
    <li> Although really cute, they don&#x27;t hold very well. I use them to hold my bangs to the side, and I keep having to reseat them.</li>
    <li> exactly as described, arrived on time, great price!</li>
    <li> Large clips for thicker hair or older child- maybe age 8-10- cute designs and good quality- but larger than I thought</li>
    <li> I got these for my twin 3-year old girls. They are slightly larger than other girls snap clips which is great for clipping back thick hair. One of my daughters has very fine, thin hair and these don&#x27;t have enough grip to hold her hair but my other daughter has such thick hair, smaller ones won&#x27;t snap closed. These are perfect for her hair and she loves the colors and flower pattern.</li>
    <li> My girls liked these.  They hold well in thicker hair as well as thinner hair.  About 2 inches from tail to tip.</li>
    <li> MY BABY NICOLE LOVES ITS</li>
    <li> Two months after Christmas and they are standing up to steady use. She loves the color combinations. She calles the Blue with pink features her Elsa jewelery</li>
    <li> They are beautifull and hold very good the hair</li>
    <li> Bought these when my daughter was maybe 18months and she&#x27;s 3.5 and they&#x27;re still all in great condition. She has a LOT of hair (all the way to her bottom) and these are one of the only hair clippies that I can count on to last through the day. I have to resnap as she plays (as you would with any clippies) but it&#x27;s easy and the unique color combos match pretty much everything. We have used every one of these in some way.</li>
    <li> Perfect for 3 year olds fine hair and cute!!</li>
    <li> These are good for adult sized heads.  Not ideal for small girls heads.  They are cute, well made and colorful.</li>
    <li> I have a rambunctious three year old who&#x27;s hair is in between bangs and no bangs as she is growing them out.  So, I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding things to pin her hair back that work.  THESE DO JUST THAT!!!!  They stay in through a whole day of preschool with rough play and her hair is still up and back at the end of the day.  Winner!</li>
    <li> Great clips for fine hair.  They hold hair in place and don&#x27;t slip at all.  Flower design is also nice for a change from standard colors.</li>
    <li> Nice looking clips but hair catches on the underside between the plastic and the metal clip.  The 5 yo can put clips on/off herself.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re very cute barrettes, but they&#x27;re so heavy that they slide out of my daughter&#x27;s hair unless I pin them in place with another barrette.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my five year old daughter. These are nice because they are cute and stay in place. Cute designs and can hold a decent amount of hair.</li>
