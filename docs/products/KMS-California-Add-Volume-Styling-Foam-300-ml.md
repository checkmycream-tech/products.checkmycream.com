      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I was first introduced to this product at my salon and one of the reasons they loved the product</li>

      <li>my fine hair has lift and body.</li>
      <li>This is a fantastic volumizer item.</li>
      <li>I have short hair and it is great.</li>
      <li>Solid product, does a good job of holding and doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming scent like some.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many brands of &amp;#34;volumizing&amp;#34; mousse, I need a spread sheet to keep them all straight!</li>
      <li>I like the smell of the product, the clean feeling of my hair, and the volume.</li>
      <li>This styling foam has just the right amount of firmness for my fine hair.  </li>
      <li>I am a real hair product &amp;#34;snob&amp;#34; and have been using Kerastase for quite some time but this product works SO much better.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it would work really well.  </li>
      <li>I have a whole shelf full of styling mousse&#x27;s and gels from trying to get body into  my fine hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d had a KMS pump spray that I liked better, was more subtle in character than the foam.</li>
      <li>First, of course, is the body!</li>
      <li>It has a nice but not overpowering fragrance and is nice and thick.  </li>
      <li>You can feel the difference in your hair right away....</li>
      <li>Great for thin, fine hair.</li>

      <li>This is the first product I&#x27;ve found that gives my hair volume for longer than 20 minutes ...</li>
      <li>and this is the only product that I&#x27;ve ever used which gives me volume and body, not to mention the healthy shine I continue to have.  </li>
      <li>It has been so fun having a cool style and not limp hair.  </li>
      <li>it holds great and doesn&#x27;t feel like your hair is matted when you wet it the next day.</li>
      <li>Good product - just have to learn to use a tiny bit when you have fine hair, otherwise it is too heavy</li>
      <li>Some mousses are so airy I don&#x27;t feel as if they do anything for my hair, but this one is solid and spreads easily in my hands for even application.  </li>
      <li>It takes my FLAT, FINE, STRAIGHT hair and gives it LIFT and texture!  </li>
      <li>If you have fine hair like me this product will not only make your hair feel thicker it will look thicker too.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;d recommend it as there are likely many more less damaging products on the market, but I don&#x27;t dislike it either.</li>
      <li>There are a couple of things I really like about this mousse.</li>
      <li>Does it really add volume?  </li>
      <li>It really does what I expect of a volume styling foam.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this!</li>
      <li>This product really does the trick to give volume.  </li>
      <li>this foam along with a drop of distortion gives me so much body.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Well, not that much; it would probably take a heavy-duty hairspray to do that.  </li>
      <li>I have trouble with all types of this kind of product.  </li>
      <li>many products leave my hair full of body but dull looking.</li>
      <li>It gives me soft volume, easy to manage and adds moisture back to my hair.  </li>
      <li>I have very, very fine limp hair</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this mousse.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Truly adds volume and tames those curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For straight, fine or limp hair, it adds real volume.  </li>
      <li>Reminds me of a freshly drooled on pillow, which last all day :-\  , otherwise I would have given 5 stars.</li>
      <li>Good, but not great.  </li>
      <li>Just enough to hold my fine (short 3-4&amp;#34</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have a difficult time managing my mop of long, fine, curly hair.  This is an absolutely essential product to tame my hair, and provide volume and sleek curls.  Apply all over hair when wet, scrunch hair a few times and blow dry on low or with a diffuser.  Truly adds volume and tames those curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For straight, fine or limp hair, it adds real volume.  Apply all over hair when wet and blow dry with round brush.  The results are great if you&#x27;re looking to add volume.</li>
    <li> When my stylist uses this on my hair at the salon, of course it looks great. I can&#x27;t get the same results at home though, so I probably won&#x27;t repurchase. But you can rarely go wrong with a KMS product, so it&#x27;s worth a try for anyone who wants extra volume.</li>
    <li> I use this product everyday and even in high humidity my fine hair has lift and body. I love it!</li>
    <li> Got good hold but leaves hair little stiff. But I&#x27;d buy it again. Love the smell</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product and for the person with &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; hair I&#x27;m sure it would work really well.  My hair is difficult and it&#x27;s just okay.  I have trouble with all types of this kind of product.  Just wanted to see if this one was different.  It is different in the fact that it is not too heavy.  It&#x27;s just okay for me - not great - but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the product&#x27;s fault - I think it&#x27;s my difficult hair....</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard for me to rate this product. When it arrived, the plastic cap was off and the nozzle was broken, so the can wouldn&#x27;t dispense any foam. I contacted the seller and he elected to give me a refund, rather than send me another can. Thus, the reason for three stars.</li>
    <li> Good, but not great.  There are some other items that I like better than this such as Bumble and Bumble volume mousse.</li>
    <li> Solid product, does a good job of holding and doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming scent like some. I have very light hair and if you use a lot it will considerably darken it so beware of that.</li>
    <li> Love the product.  Gives my hair staying power in the humid environment that is Florida!</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my hairdresser and it works great.  It&#x27;s not sticky and it keeps the style longer.</li>
    <li> I have tried nearly every product out there for hair!  I have thick, coarse and dry hair!  I use this product directly after I shampoo and condition before styling while hair is still wet.  It gives me soft volume, easy to manage and adds moisture back to my hair.  It does not weigh your hair down and it smells yummy!  I would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This product does everything it says it does and it is extremely hard to find in stores!  I will continue to buy it wherever I can find it.</li>
    <li> Love this product....will buy again</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s awesome when used in conjunction with the KMS California Add Volume Volumizing Spray.  Creates a lot of volume while blow drying.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have a whole shelf full of styling mousse&#x27;s and gels from trying to get body into  my fine hair. I do have a lot of hair but it is fine and looks pretty thin because of the lack of body. There are a couple of things I really like about this mousse. First, of course, is the body! My hair is full and it looks like I have thick hair...finally! But I also like my hair to shine and many products leave my hair full of body but dull looking. I love this because I still hair shiny healthy looking hair. I am a real hair product &amp;#34;snob&amp;#34; and have been using Kerastase for quite some time but this product works SO much better. I will be trying the shampoo and conditioner next! I highly recommend this mousse. If you hair fine hair especially you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> Great product!!  Doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel stiff.</li>
    <li> It works. I have used it for a long time and if I change I always come back. I Have found nothing better.</li>
    <li> I usually only use Paul Mitchell mousse and haven&#x27;t ventured away from that in a very long time.  I read a review of this product in a magazine and I also use their volumizing spray, so thought I would give this a shot.  This is a really good mousse!  It has a nice but not overpowering fragrance and is nice and thick.  Some mousses are so airy I don&#x27;t feel as if they do anything for my hair, but this one is solid and spreads easily in my hands for even application.  I don&#x27;t put mousse anywhere but on my roots to add volume and this one does not weigh my roots down and gives them lots of volume!  I would highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> I have very, very fine limp hair and this is the only product that I&#x27;ve ever used which gives me volume and body, not to mention the healthy shine I continue to have.  I was first introduced to this product at my salon and one of the reasons they loved the product was because of the effect it had on problem hair like mine.</li>
    <li> Used product previously and was satisfied with the results; the container was bent in several places, but didn&#x27;t affect the product.</li>
    <li> This is great for adding body to my thick limp hair. I use it on the roots to give me a little lift.</li>
    <li> Not what I was looking for thought. I&#x27;d had a KMS pump spray that I liked better, was more subtle in character than the foam.</li>
    <li> This styling foam has just the right amount of firmness for my fine hair.  I love being able to order it from Amazon!</li>
    <li> This product left my hair in a knotted mess &amp; very dull.  Almost impossible to get comb in hair.  Really disappointed.</li>
    <li> this is awesome used it wto weeks i still like it has a cooling effect as soon as you use it love the smell</li>
    <li> I cannot wash my color treated thin hair with out applying KMS California Add Formula afterwards. it makes my hair have volume and bounce.</li>
    <li> Excellent foam consistency.  Like whipped cream without stickiness or perfume smell.  Sorry it&#x27;s not sold in stores.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> You can feel the difference in your hair right away....holds great....gives lift and makes styling so much easier, and holds great !  :)</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Just enough to hold my fine (short 3-4&amp;#34;) hair in place.</li>
    <li> I like the body this gives my limp, fine hair.  But I don&#x27;t use it every day because I find it a bit drying to my hair.  I like it, generally, though.  I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;d recommend it as there are likely many more less damaging products on the market, but I don&#x27;t dislike it either.</li>
    <li> have been using it for 10 years now, minimizes frizz and great for curly hair</li>
    <li> Just does not have the hold I need. May work great for someone with a thicker hair, but my finer hair needs more. Has a nice smell!</li>
    <li> If you have fine hair like me this product will not only make your hair feel thicker it will look thicker too.  KMS is the best product out there.</li>
    <li> Great for limp, thin hair</li>
    <li> I have the thinnest hair possible!  Always have had thin hair.  I got my hair cut short and this foam along with a drop of distortion gives me so much body. For the first time in my life age 54 I actually love my hair and style. It has been so fun having a cool style and not limp hair.  I just can&#x27;t believe it.  I use Ice hair spray with this foam and a bit of distortion product.  Love the look. Now my daughters who have much better hair than I, they are using it too.  All of us are happy! Yes recommend - its all in the product!</li>
    <li> Good product - just have to learn to use a tiny bit when you have fine hair, otherwise it is too heavy</li>
    <li> i always look for a styling product that is not sticky. this is it. it holds great and doesn&#x27;t feel like your hair is matted when you wet it the next day. i don&#x27;t blow dry my hair as i have a perm. love, love this product!!</li>
    <li> My hair is very fine ... and in humid Florida, that&#x27;s not a good thing. This is the first product I&#x27;ve found that gives my hair volume for longer than 20 minutes ... in fact, it lasts a day or two when I combine it with a good hair spray.  I keep my hair short and in layers; I style it with KMS add volume foam and blow dry.  I get good control from the beginning, but my hair still feels like hair.  The spray keeps everything in place, but can be brushed out for a softer feel.  I never get that &amp;#34;flat to the head&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve dealt with all of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks KMS</li>
    <li> One of the few products that I have found that really does add volume to my flat hair and holds it.</li>
    <li> Very good for my fine hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Came wrapped well.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It really does what I expect of a volume styling foam.  I&#x27;ve tried lots of others but this one is the best I&#x27;ve EVER tried.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair but a good haircut.  This product really does the trick to give volume.  It makes the hair managable...I love it!  Try it...you&#x27;ll love it too.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and love it.  It is hard to find in my area.&lt;br /&gt;I was pleased with the quality of the product and it was prompt in coming.&lt;br /&gt;Would order again as it was a great price!</li>
    <li> Saw this on YouTube and was happy to find it on a amazon.  I like the smell of the product, the clean feeling of my hair, and the volume.</li>
    <li> this is great product.... has a great smell and works great</li>
    <li> I have been using this hairstyling mousse for about ten years now.  It leaves my hair soft and manageable and not stiff when I blow my hair out and style it.</li>
    <li> I have fine, heavy, straight shoulder-length hair that loves to go flat.  It really hasn&#x27;t been happy since the 60&#x27;s.  This product was mentioned in a magazine, so I ordered a bottle.  Does it really add volume?  Well, not that much; it would probably take a heavy-duty hairspray to do that.  What it does do, however, is keep my hair from going flat, and that&#x27;s major for me.  My hair stays shiny and looks a  bit fuller, and there is no gunky product-residue feel.  I&#x27;m going to try the KMS root lift to see which I like better, but I&#x27;m very, very happy with this product.  Highly recommend to those who need a little boost but want to keep that natural look and feel.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many brands of &amp;#34;volumizing&amp;#34; mousse, I need a spread sheet to keep them all straight! (No pun intended)  Most over the counter/drugstore/common brands but also Redken&#x27;s Full Frame.  Nothing helped.  Flat by end of day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one was pricey and I hesitated but figured, come on, one more shot.  I am so glad I did.  It takes my FLAT, FINE, STRAIGHT hair and gives it LIFT and texture!  I apply to damp hair, comb it through, wait an hour or so and blow dry with a round brush. POOF! Lots of lift.  I am REALLY happy with my hair again. Now I need ti find it as inexpensive as I can, and see how long this can lasts.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d give it a 5 but it&#x27;s too expensive. Use sparingly! Not sure I&#x27;ll buy it again because of the price.</li>
    <li> My new brand of mousse.  I use it with the KSM Boost.  Great for thin, fine hair.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic volumizer item. I have short hair and it is great. Do not hesitate in purchasing. You&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only product of this type that works on long hair!</li>
    <li> Put a small amount in your palm before blowing drying onto your hair and it makes it puff up like I have double.</li>
    <li> It does exactly what it is supposed to do and in that respect it&#x27;s great, but I hate the smell. Reminds me of a freshly drooled on pillow, which last all day :-\  , otherwise I would have given 5 stars.</li>
