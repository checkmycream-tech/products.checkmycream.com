      <li>I did receive this at a reduced price for an honest opinion.  </li>
      <li>Excellent product, I would highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>and I was pleased that it had a nice fruity scent.</li>
      <li>i love it.</li>
      <li>I am so glad I did my hair no longer sheds</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s fuller and just feels healthy.  </li>
      <li>I love this Shampoo.  </li>
      <li>Cause my hair to fall out more.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s magic.</li>
      <li>The longer my hair grows the more it falls out.</li>
      <li>and I just had to give it 5 stars, because the shampoo was there for me when I needed it most.</li>
      <li>Great so far for me.  </li>
      <li>I was given a complimentary sample of Apex Crown for me to try and in exchange I would give my honest opinion of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a medium thickness with a very light, clean scent for men and woman.</li>
      <li>It has a odd texture and an offputting smell, which isn&#x27;t the best for a product that goes into your hair.</li>
      <li>I liked the first bottle I got so well, that I ordered a second before people figure out what a great shampoo this and the price goes up.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo everyday for almost a month &amp;amp; I can&#x27;t even explain the joy it has brought me!</li>
      <li>Such a great product and</li>
      <li>/&gt;It came very well sealed, which was nice.</li>
      <li>I did not feel any tingly feelings or anything, but it did leave my hair and scalp feeling very fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>You never want &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; clean hair.</li>
      <li>It actually works very well, smells great</li>
      <li>Over all very pleased and will update on the latter.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need a lot to get a nice lather, and you only need to wash it once to get a thorough clean.</li>
      <li>Really thickens your hair, not sure if I have more hair because of this but really a great thickener.</li>
      <li>I with certainty calm this product will cause heart palpitations.</li>
      <li>but I love how soft and smooth my hair feels and it looks so much healthier</li>
      <li>First of all, I bought this at the full listed Amazon price.</li>
      <li>Given the many positive reviews, I had high hopes for this &amp;#34;anti-hair loss&amp;#34; shampoo.  </li>
      <li>right now I can&#x27;t say if it helps with hair loss or promates grow.</li>
      <li>One thing I have noticed is that for oily hair this shampoo requires two or three applications for it to really clean the hair, which makes the quantity of this bottle disappear much faster.</li>
      <li>For that sole reason its worth buying again as that she has tried product after product and has never been satisfied until now.</li>
      <li>In fact, I lost more hair by the second wash.</li>
      <li>Plus having hypothyroidism doesn&#x27;t exactly help my hair situation either.</li>
      <li>My girlfriend is in love with this shampoo and says its has instantly made her hair fuller and easier to manage after a wash.  </li>
      <li>It unfortunately is not a product that is for everyone.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Made my hair feel and look thicker the first time I used it.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>exactly as described on product page.  </li>
      <li>Just be aware of the ingredients in this product and hopefully it will work for you.</li>
      <li>I, of course, had to smell it first</li>
      <li>It was clean, nonstripping of color and natural oils.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always had fine hair, but when I hit 40 I started to notice my hair falling out more than usual.</li>
      <li>update: When I left my review the company contacted me and offered a FULL refund!</li>
      <li>It was a lot thicker than regular shampoo too and it was easy to really massage it thoroughly into my hair and scalp.</li>
      <li>Just what I needed after loosing so much hair after the birth of my twin babies.</li>
      <li>(and I&#x27;ve forgotten it and it&#x27;s been on much, much longer).</li>
      <li>I was absolutely stunned.</li>
      <li>For me it doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to determine if it truly stimulates growth, but it&#x27;s a nice shampoo.</li>
      <li>Not only does it smell fantastic, Instantly after the first use my hair felt thicker.</li>
      <li>I got a high discount code for purchase it.</li>
      <li>I normally don&#x27;t use shampoos that contains sulfates but since this was to promote hair growth I wanted to give it a go.</li>
      <li>While it did not cause new growth, it did stop the shedding.</li>
      <li>It also has caffeine in it which stimulates new hair growth as well.</li>
      <li>There is no scalp irritation, and it has a very soft, fruity smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;While it&#x27;s too soon to say whether it&#x27;s actually growing new hair, or just stopping the shedding, I can say that in less than a week I look like I have more hair, and I will continue using it.</li>
      <li>And, so, the search for a good shampoo that REALLY blocks or at least slows down hair loss continues . . .</li>
      <li>However, like so many other shampoos I&#x27;ve tried here on Amazon, this product did not live up to the hype.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s clear and it doesn&#x27;t smell</li>
      <li>/&gt;Since I only drink 1 or 2 cups of coffee a day, I really didn&#x27;t think anything of what my doctor said about my caffeine intake.</li>
      <li>and so far I have not noticed any change.  </li>
      <li>I was still having daily heart palpitations and really wanted to figure out why.</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly,thick,color treated hair.</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair and my hair was shedding,  </li>
      <li>like the natural ingredients, too.  </li>
      <li>But, after shampooing, I notice that the color treated ends are soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>However, I think it&#x27;s too early to tell.  </li>
      <li>After I rinsed my hair, I instantly noticed I was wringing out what felt like more hair than usual.</li>
      <li>It actually smells better than some of the pricey shampoos I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
      <li>It is less than half the price, and as for the quality of the shampoo, it is performing better than the Ultrax.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a considerable difference in the texture of my hair in just a short period of time.</li>
      <li>My hair has no natural body and normally droops against my scalp.</li>
      <li>I always feel a little more alert after my morning shower, but today this shampoo gave me a little something extra.  </li>
      <li>I never expected a tingling sensation as that only shampoos with peppermint oils or tea tree oils do that.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell bad or good IMO</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product actually arrived when I was on call for work and I was seriously lacking in the sleep department.  I always feel a little more alert after my morning shower, but today this shampoo gave me a little something extra.  I did get this item using a promotional code that required I give a review and I just had to give it 5 stars, because the shampoo was there for me when I needed it most.</li>
    <li> I love this Shampoo.  Not only does it smell fantastic, Instantly after the first use my hair felt thicker. After a week of using it everyday my hair feels and looks noticeably thicker and stronger. Just what I needed after loosing so much hair after the birth of my twin babies. Such a great product and I will continue to use it everyday..!! ** Disclaimer** I have received this Product in Exchange for My Unbiased Review .</li>
    <li> The Hair Loss Shampoo was delivered sealed, and protectively packaged.&lt;br /&gt;and exactly as described on product page.  We received the Wick &amp; Strom&lt;br /&gt;shampoo in a promotion for testing and review.  My father has been using&lt;br /&gt;this shampoo for a week now, and his hair is shiny and less dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;We like the natural ingredients, too.  It&#x27;s too soon to say if the shampoo&lt;br /&gt;is preventing hair loss, but will update with any future findings.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and my hair was shedding,  so I decided to purchase this shampoo.  I am so glad I did my hair no longer sheds and it&#x27;s fuller and just feels healthy.  I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly,thick,color treated hair. I do have hair loss due to medications. It&#x27;s a medium thickness with a very light, clean scent for men and woman. I did have to use a good bit..but I do have a ton of hair! It was clean, nonstripping of color and natural oils. You never want &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; clean hair. It&#x27;s to harsh and drying if it is. I&#x27;ve not used but a week, so right now I can&#x27;t say if it helps with hair loss or promates grow. Over all very pleased and will update on the latter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had fine hair, but when I hit 40 I started to notice my hair falling out more than usual. Now at age 45, it&#x27;s a nightmare. Plus having hypothyroidism doesn&#x27;t exactly help my hair situation either. I was given a complimentary sample of Apex Crown for me to try and in exchange I would give my honest opinion of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came very well sealed, which was nice. I, of course, had to smell it first and I was pleased that it had a nice fruity scent. It actually smells better than some of the pricey shampoos I&#x27;ve used in the past. It was a lot thicker than regular shampoo too and it was easy to really massage it thoroughly into my hair and scalp. I let it sit on my head for approximately two minutes or so, giving it time to really work it&#x27;s magic. After I rinsed my hair, I instantly noticed I was wringing out what felt like more hair than usual. I was absolutely stunned. I had no idea that it works that fast!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is loaded with essential vitamins and minerals that all work together to help combat thinning hair and hair loss. It also has caffeine in it which stimulates new hair growth as well. I&#x27;ve noticed a considerable difference in the texture of my hair in just a short period of time. I am so happy with the results I am seeing, I&#x27;ve ordered another bottle. It actually works very well, smells great and my hair has never looked better! I am very satisfied that this product, it does everything it claims to do, which is stop my hair from falling out and help stimulate hair growth. Excellent product, I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have never found a regular shampoo I like, let alone a shampoo for hair loss. I like using this shampoo.  This Apex Crown Shampoo doesn&#x27;t smell like chemicals or medicine.  It smells really good-like a faint scent of banana.  I color my hair &amp; it didn&#x27;t strip the color.  It did however, brighten it. My hair has always come out when I comb or brush it.  The only place it is thin is near my temples but not too bad.  Otherwise, my hair is thick &amp; heavy-I have to get it thinned out!  I did receive this at a reduced price for an honest opinion.  I love it!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I got a high discount code for purchase it. i love it. my hair loss a lot everyday. so i use it to prevent my hair loss.</li>
    <li> This shampoo does not have a scent, which is different considering almost every one on the market does. I did not feel any tingly feelings or anything, but it did leave my hair and scalp feeling very fresh and clean. I will continue to use it for their 60 day challenge and assess if there were any improvements in my hair thickness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** received for review and inspection purposes **</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a week now and so far I have not noticed any change.  However, I think it&#x27;s too early to tell.  One thing I have noticed is that for oily hair this shampoo requires two or three applications for it to really clean the hair, which makes the quantity of this bottle disappear much faster.</li>
    <li> Hasn&#x27;t done anything for me</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a big change in hair. Wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the way it suds or the smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An update: When I left my review the company contacted me and offered a FULL refund! This is the kind of Company we want/need to do business with! Made in USA! You go Wick &amp; Strom!</li>
    <li> This works great ........ noticed a difference in 2 weeks</li>
    <li> Really thickens your hair, not sure if I have more hair because of this but really a great thickener.</li>
    <li> This is good shampoo that cleans thoroughly. I normally don&#x27;t use shampoos that contains sulfates but since this was to promote hair growth I wanted to give it a go. For me it doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad or good IMO it hardly has a scent. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to determine if it truly stimulates growth, but it&#x27;s a nice shampoo. You don&#x27;t need a lot to get a nice lather, and you only need to wash it once to get a thorough clean. I will update this review after using it for a longer period of time to determine if I notice additional growth stimulation.</li>
    <li> Made my hair feel and look thicker the first time I used it.</li>
    <li> Noticed instant improvements in my hair!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Just purchased this product for my girlfriend and myself.  I am African-American, and have been seeking a solution for my thinning hair along my edges.  I have noticed an instant improvement in my hair quality after a wash.  I never expected a tingling sensation as that only shampoos with peppermint oils or tea tree oils do that.  Great so far for me.  My girlfriend is in love with this shampoo and says its has instantly made her hair fuller and easier to manage after a wash.  For that sole reason its worth buying again as that she has tried product after product and has never been satisfied until now.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say one way or another if it works or not because after a few days of use my scalp became irritated and I had to stop using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I wrote this review I was contacted by Wick &amp; Str&amp;ouml;m and they were sorry that this product didn&#x27;t work for me and refunded my order amount no questions asked. I don&#x27;t about the product but they seem to have excellent customer service.</li>
    <li> It is not worth a penny. Cause my hair to fall out more.</li>
    <li> I have long dark hair and I&#x27;m in my late 20s. This shampoo did not work for me. In fact, I lost more hair by the second wash.</li>
    <li> Received in good shape. Havent ysed it long enough to know if it works as it claims</li>
    <li> The longer my hair grows the more it falls out. Brushing it and tons fall out in the shower. I already notice that I am finding less in the shower and my brush. My husband is bald and I am going to have him start using it. I&#x27;m hoping I can finally grow my hair long with time without it getting thin!</li>
    <li> BUY IT! I was stressing out so bad, my hair was falling out in chunks to the point where I would cry when I showered or brushed my hair.. I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo everyday for almost a month &amp;amp; I can&#x27;t even explain the joy it has brought me! My hair stopped falling out!!!! It&#x27;s literally a miracle in a bottle. Don&#x27;t doubt this purchase for a second. It&#x27;s AMAZING!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a hair loss prevention shampoo for a while, and decided to give this one a try. After many uses, I noticed no difference! It has a odd texture and an offputting smell, which isn&#x27;t the best for a product that goes into your hair. People tell me they can smell it when they are sitting next to me which is a bad sign. I am still losing hair and am not noticing any improvement.</li>
    <li> I got this shampoo because my hair takes forever to grow and I miss my long hair lol. This shampoo is just a tad thicker that other shampoos but it might be because it has different ingredients it&#x27;s clear and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve have only been using the shampoo for a week and a half and I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday only 3 to 4 times a week so I can&#x27;t say If it helps hair grow but I love how soft and smooth my hair feels and it looks so much healthier as well I have really dry and damaged curly hair and this shampoo has helped a lot with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use it until I finish the bottle to see if it actually helps my hair grow.</li>
    <li> It is very hard for me to rate this product with any accuracy. A few days after starting to use this shampoo, I began having heart palpitations. I saw my doctor about them, and after some heart tests, everything checked out with my heart. He said heart palpitations are common and usually nothing to worry about. He suggested I limit my stress as well as caffeine intake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I only drink 1 or 2 cups of coffee a day, I really didn&#x27;t think anything of what my doctor said about my caffeine intake. I was still having daily heart palpitations and really wanted to figure out why. I started from the beginning. When did these start? What if any lifestyle changes have I made since the palpitations started? Then it hit me. The only thing different was I started using this shampoo. This shampoo has caffeine. Caffeine potentially causes heart palpitations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product for almost a month. During that time, I had daily heart palpitations. A day or two after stopping using this shampoo, no more heart palpitations, and none in several weeks since I stopped using this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can I with certainty calm this product will cause heart palpitations. Absolutely not! However, heart palpitations may be caused by caffeine. Just be aware of the ingredients in this product and hopefully it will work for you. It unfortunately is not a product that is for everyone.</li>
    <li> Given the many positive reviews, I had high hopes for this &amp;#34;anti-hair loss&amp;#34; shampoo.  However, like so many other shampoos I&#x27;ve tried here on Amazon, this product did not live up to the hype.  Although hair shedding seemed to diminish some, Apex Crown irritated my scalp and caused a breakout of red blemishes on my face, neck, and back.  Out of desperation to share the claimed experiences of other reviewers, I gave it a shot for about 3 weeks; but  after the symptoms persisted, I ultimately had to throw in the towel.  And, so, the search for a good shampoo that REALLY blocks or at least slows down hair loss continues . . .</li>
    <li> First of all, I bought this at the full listed Amazon price. I did not receive it as a promotion for an unbiased review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previously, I&#x27;d used the Ultrax Labs Hair Surge for $43.99. While it did not cause new growth, it did stop the shedding. It was pricey, so I tried this one. I am so delighted that I did. It is less than half the price, and as for the quality of the shampoo, it is performing better than the Ultrax. I have been only using it for a few days, leaving it on my hair for 2 minutes (and I&#x27;ve forgotten it and it&#x27;s been on much, much longer). There is no scalp irritation, and it has a very soft, fruity smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is streaked, and the ends are very dry. But, after shampooing, I notice that the color treated ends are soft and manageable. My hair has no natural body and normally droops against my scalp. This shampoo &amp;#34;puffs it up&amp;#34; and gives me a ton of body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it&#x27;s too soon to say whether it&#x27;s actually growing new hair, or just stopping the shedding, I can say that in less than a week I look like I have more hair, and I will continue using it. I liked the first bottle I got so well, that I ordered a second before people figure out what a great shampoo this and the price goes up.</li>
