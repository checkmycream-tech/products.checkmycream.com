      <li>But still nice.</li>
      <li>had probably five lighted make-up mirrors in my life (I&#x27;m in my 40s), and they all were quite nice.  </li>

      <li>The light is quite bright -</li>

      <li>This mirror sits on the table just fine.</li>
      <li>then that it&#x27;s fine</li>
      <li>but it works out fine as she can just fold up the sides and slide the mirror out of the way.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This mirror sits on the table just fine.</li>

      <li>Not blinding, but adds in light for make-up application.</li>
      <li>This is extremely light weight.</li>
      <li>The middle mirror is a good size, you can see your whole face at a good distance.</li>
      <li>Love that it fits right into my makeup bag.</li>
      <li>Quick, easy fix to that issue!&lt;br /&gt;5</li>
      <li>Super easy to pack in a suitcase and travel with.</li>
      <li>My batteries died quick, but they are cheap batteries</li>
      <li>if you need a bright light on your mirror, try a different product.</li>
      <li>This mirror would be good for an American Girl Doll and that&#x27;s about it.</li>
      <li>It actually ended up working good for my daughter</li>
      <li>AND IT LOOKED LIKE A FULL SIZE MIRROR</li>
      <li>The light is ok in a pinch, but I prefer better wattage &amp; lighting options for regular use at home.</li>
      <li>Product is a lot smaller than it appears online however still a good buy.</li>
      <li>I expected better quality from a huge reputable company like Conair.</li>
      <li>thanks !!</li>

      <li>So far - I look fine!</li>
      <li>So far - I look fine!</li>
      <li>It would be great for a little girl&#x27;s dressing table.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I set it up, put the batteries in and was REALLY unimpressed with the amount of light it provided (I should say Did NOT provide.)</li>
      <li>Are there any other better battery operated mirrors that do a better job?</li>
      <li>Fits perfect on my desk without it taking up too much space, nor too small that I can&#x27;t make much use of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:</li>
      <li>Too small and the light source is almost like a night light!!  </li>
      <li>The only difference in the mirrors nowadays is that they are lit with a different type of bulb (which is good because who wants to hover over hot light bulbs while putting on makeup?)  </li>
      <li>The light is very dim however &amp; I think if the middle panel was 2 inches wider it would make it even better-</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is a handy little make-up mirror.  I love it.  It is exactly as described by the seller.  You can fold it to fit nicely in a drawer.  It is very lightweight, about a pound.  Center mirror is about the size of a hand-held mirror.  The side mirrors are about 5 inches by 2 inches.  The LED lights are quite sufficient, but not really needed unless you live in a very dark place.</li>
    <li> Close up for applying eye makeup.  Bright and easy to use.  Small enough that it does not take up a lot of room.</li>
    <li> Smaller than anticipated</li>
    <li> Terrible. Too small and the light source is almost like a night light!!  Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> Lovely mirror but it is small.  I should have checked the dimensions.  However it folds away nicely</li>
    <li> A lot small then looked online, not bright enough</li>
    <li> Too small for my purpose.  It might be good for a travel mirror (to use in hotel rooms, etc) but not for everyday use.  I returned it.</li>
    <li> Not a very good mirror.  It is very small and difficult to use.  I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> Did not like this at all</li>
    <li> My wife loves the mirror and uses it daily.  Her old mirror broke and she needed a new one.  This was the perfect birthday gift.</li>
    <li> It is so small, I had no idea it is a travel sized mirror! LOL but I did wind up keeping it just in case I ever need it on a trip. Light is florescent though, so it&#x27;s a little bit of a detriment.</li>
    <li> This is a very small mirror, but that makes it great for travel.</li>
    <li> Fits perfect on my desk without it taking up too much space, nor too small that I can&#x27;t make much use of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Perfect size for the top of my desk&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Lights on it do not illuminate, they are more just for show, but are not bright enough.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s wayyyy too small but other then that it&#x27;s fine</li>
    <li> Very disappointed! The lights are not bright at all and the batteries wear-out very quickly. I initially purchase this for traveling...alas, it was not meant to be. I expected better quality from a huge reputable company like Conair. Meanwhile, the stand is perfect. If they would just fix the battery issue and the lighting it would be great. Take it from someone who has literally spent thousands upon thousands of dollars on beauty products throughout her life time that this is not something you should be purchasing for yourself or anyone else.</li>
    <li> I was really disappointed with the size of the mirror. I guess I should have read that better. It was a lot smaller that I thought for the money, should have been cheaper, so small. Was not satisfied. Sorry</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t typically use a make-up mirror. (After looking at this, maybe I should? haha) I purchased this for use in my guest room, mainly for my mom. I tried it out. In my opinion, the lights are perfect. Not blinding, but adds in light for make-up application. The middle mirror is a good size, you can see your whole face at a good distance. The side mirrors provide nice magnification. It folds up nicely and would be perfect for travel, too. I like that it uses batteries, so that it can be moved around the room as needed and isn&#x27;t bulky. I would recommend this mirror to the everyday user or traveler.</li>
    <li> This is a very small, lightweight mirror, which is exactly what I needed.  Love that it fits right into my makeup bag.</li>
    <li> Product is a lot smaller than it appears online however still a good buy. Light is not as bright to see all unsightly hairs however great for travel</li>
    <li> can barely see the light and it is small... very small for the price.  ended up buying another one from Target that was large and excellent lights</li>
    <li> Tiny,...but cute.  The light is nice, its just to darn small.  Perfect for a Barbie doll head or a child who&#x27;s an aspiring hairstylist.</li>
    <li> Great price...fast delivery...cute mirror...small but works well for me for makeup, closeups of hair &amp; to see the back of your hair in another mirror.  The light is very dim however &amp; I think if the middle panel was 2 inches wider it would make it even better- but overall happy with purchase &amp; seller..TY</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty surprised at some of the negative reviews! Here&#x27;s my honest opinion....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I ordered this mirror, I was thinking it was going to be this huge, heavy mirror with lights. I was looking for a mirror that lights up and has magnification and would store in a drawer or train case when not in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. This is extremely light weight. Perfect for me - I am 50 and have suffered 2 broken necks and a back so heavy items are a no go for me.&lt;br /&gt;2. I LOVE how it folds up so you can store it in a drawer or even pack it in the suitcase for travel. It really is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;3.  I like how the big mirror is the perfect size for makeup application, tweeze your eyebrows - or whatever you need to use it for. And I like that the smaller side mirrors are magnified!&lt;br /&gt;4. The light is quite bright - I have NO problems seeing my face in this mirror at all! My batteries died quick, but they are cheap batteries and I always replace them with my own batteries right off the bat so I don&#x27;t get mad when the other kind dies. Quick, easy fix to that issue!&lt;br /&gt;5. I like how you can tilt the mirror at different angles &amp;#60;say you&#x27;re standing at the bathroom sink - tilt it back so you can see, or however you want to tilt it!&amp;#62; You can see the way it tilts in the photo in the description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The center mirror is about 6 inches tall by about 4 inches wide. Each side mirror is about 2.5 inches wide by 6 inches tall. I am 50 years old so I am full grown, and feel the size is great for applying my makeup. It lights just just fine..I can see everything I need to see to do my makeup perfectly. I suppose if you want a mirror big enough to see your entire head, neck and stuff around your head - get a vanity table, or go sit in front of your bathroom mirror. What else do you need to see buy your face? LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. The best part - at least for me - is there&#x27;s no plugging this into a wall, so there&#x27;s no cord to get stuck on anything and fall to the floor and possible break. The stand is the perfect size to sit on a counter or table. I sit on my couch and have a movable computer table that I use to do my makeup. This mirror sits on the table just fine. No slipping, no falling over. It&#x27;s great. I get natural light from outside plus the light from the lamps in my living room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why people complain about the light - it&#x27;s actually pretty bright. My living room is so dark that I definitely need good light to put on my makeup so I don&#x27;t look like a clown when I leave the house. So far - I look fine! Nor do I know why there are complaints about the weight or size. It&#x27;s big enough to see your face in, it&#x27;s small enough that when you close the &amp;#34;doors&amp;#34; &amp;#60;the side mirrors&amp;#62; and fold it...it fits very nicely in my train case or my bathroom drawer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using a small hand held mirror that had metal &amp;#34;legs&amp;#34; that you separate so it can sit on a counter....and this mirror is SO much better!&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a big professional type makeup mirror - keep on going!&lt;br /&gt;For $25 bucks you just can&#x27;t go wrong. I love it and would definitely recommend it.d possible break. The stand is the perfect size to sit on a counter or table.

I love it and would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have a bad habit of not reading reviews when ordering things.  In this case, I should have read the dimensions of this mirror: it&#x27;s not adult-sized at all. It would be great for a little girl&#x27;s dressing table.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though it&#x27;s small, I wouldn&#x27;t consider it &amp;#34;portable&amp;#34; because it&#x27;s heavy (I certainly wouldn&#x27;t pack it to take on vacation).  Since it does put out good light, I have taken a stronger magnifying mirror and attached it to this one...that way I can see clearly when plucking eyebrows, etc..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The center mirror doesn&#x27;t have magnification and the two sides only magnify 3xs. You can fold the sides over the center when not in use.  It uses batteries and has the on-off button on the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had probably five lighted make-up mirrors in my life (I&#x27;m in my 40s), and they all were quite nice.  The only difference in the mirrors nowadays is that they are lit with a different type of bulb (which is good because who wants to hover over hot light bulbs while putting on makeup?)  What I don&#x27;t understand is why manufacturers are charging so much for these mirrors.. I know there&#x27;s a such thing as &amp;#34;inflation&amp;#34;, but charging over $100 for something I paid $15 for 20 years ago seems a bit steep.</li>
    <li> LED lights are not bright enough. Mirrors work well and fit nicely in my window sill.</li>
    <li> bought this for my granddaughter but the moved out of state so I  kept it and was glad I didi  nice size to caqrry with you on trips if needed. nice gift idea.</li>
    <li> I saw this mirror at Target and it&#x27;s half the size of a regular three panel lighted makeup mirror. It&#x27;s cute and good for traveling, but there&#x27;s no way I could stick all of my big fat face into that little mirror!</li>
    <li> Smaller then I thought. But still nice.</li>
    <li> Very nice.  Exactly as I expected and arrived right on time.</li>
    <li> This mirror works great and you can carry it with you so when traveling you have the perfect light to put on your make-up.</li>
    <li> Looks bigger in photo</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how small it was I was disappointed</li>
    <li> Gets my husband to shave. Great product.</li>
    <li> The cordless portability makes this one perfect for travelling! It folds up to be short enough for a drawer or suitcase. The light is ok in a pinch, but I prefer better wattage &amp; lighting options for regular use at home. Still glad I picked it up as a back-up though!</li>
    <li> Just a little smaller than I expected, but a good buy for price that was paid.  I haven&#x27;t even put the batteries in it yet.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice storable makeup mirror.  I purchased for a teenager who likes to sit on the floor to put on her makeup and she just loved it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t always pay attention to measurements like I should so when I received this mirror, I was disappointed by how small it is.  But... It is the size described.  I set it up, put the batteries in and was REALLY unimpressed with the amount of light it provided (I should say Did NOT provide.) if you need a bright light on your mirror, try a different product.</li>
    <li> ORDERED THIS AND IT LOOKED LIKE A FULL SIZE MIRROR ON THE PICTURE.&lt;br /&gt;TO MY SURPRISE IT WAS A VERY SMALL MIRROR.</li>
    <li> This mirror is TINY. It is like a doll&#x27;s mirror. I can&#x27;t use a mirror this small when I can&#x27;t even see my whole head in it. I wanted to use it as a vanity mirror to do my hair/makeup but it was too small. This mirror would be good for an American Girl Doll and that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> Way smaller than what I thought. I could have bought something around town for the money I spent on this. I will say I do like the design of the stand. It is just way too small. I was expecting a pretty good size mirror.</li>
    <li> i bought this for myself thinking it would be a great makeup mirror...wow..guess i didn&#x27;t read it very well cause it is TINY.......i can&#x27;t even see my entire face in it at once..i gave it to my 5 year old god daughter.</li>
    <li> Too small and heavy.  I would not recommend this purchase to anyone.  I thought it would be convenient to use when I travel, but I think it is too heavy to carry in my carry-on when I don&#x27;t have to check in my luggage.</li>
    <li> Love this mirror..use it when I travel. Just bought one for a friend. Came fast. Packaged perfect.</li>
    <li> way to small, but cute for a little girl</li>
    <li> I should have read the dimensions of this mirror because it is very small.  It actually ended up working good for my daughter so it wasn&#x27;t a waste.  If I had read the size - I certainly would have bought a larger one.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror. its cordless and portable. side panel magnifiers don&#x27;t really stay in place unless you hold them where you want them. but its great otherwise</li>
    <li> The mirror is great for travel. I wanted a mirror that folds up easily. This is my first mirror of this type. Are there any other better battery operated mirrors that do a better job?</li>
    <li> I was expecting a vanity mirror and it was a travel size it was most definitely not worth the money!</li>
    <li> It is a good mirror, but was a little disappointed that it is a little on the small size. Daughter likes it.</li>
    <li> I thought for the price I could get a pretty standard, decent mirror. The actualy mirror is great..especially the magnification parts. It&#x27;s just a really tiny mirror, and the lighting is pretty dim.</li>
    <li> This mirror is very small so it is portable. The lights aren&#x27;t very bright. Probably would be the same with the lights off.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a big nice mirror, it was a tiny little good for nothing, no happy at all !</li>
    <li> Mo muther loves this great three way mirror.  it folds away nicely too.</li>
    <li> Love this mirror.  I bought two of them.  One for myself and one for my mother.  We both use it.  I especially like the fact that there are to different mirror sizes.  I use this everyday.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I sent it back. It was a lot smaller then it looked in the picture.</li>
    <li> not very substantial should have spent more on a better one</li>
    <li> This is just what I have been looking for.  Anice size, lit mirror. It works ver well and folds up nicely.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror for my Mom&#x27;s Christmas gift. She doesn&#x27;t have very good lighting in her room for putting on her make up and had been asking for a mirror like this for quite a while. She loves it and has used it everyday since unwrapping it. It is a little smaller than I anticipated  but it works out fine as she can just fold up the sides and slide the mirror out of the way.&lt;br /&gt;I may just order one for myself if she gets tired of me sneaking in to do my make up in her room.</li>
    <li> The picture does not show how it really looks.  When I opened the box I was surprised at the size.  Very small.  I should have looked to see if it gave the overall size of the item.  Best for a child not and adult.</li>
    <li> Received in time but a little disappointed in the lack of brightness. I still have to have extra light.</li>
    <li> Too small, not able to use efficiently. Price is too high for product.</li>
    <li> A lot smaller than picture, wife don&#x27;t use it because of it&#x27;s size...just another thing to take up space on her dressing table..</li>
    <li> The light sucks and ithe left side mirror broke off</li>
    <li> Was so happy to find this.  I was wanting one for my daughter. My husband bought me one and she loved it. Fast shipper and perfect condition  thanks !!</li>
    <li> Too small and not very bright. Should have known by the price it wouldn&#x27;t be much.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my daughter,a little smaller than I thought it would be,but its still a cute mirror &amp; my daughter liked it!!</li>
    <li> Got this for my daughter and she loves it. It&#x27;s well made and sturdy. I&#x27;ve never been disappointed with Conair.</li>
    <li> Does the job but much smaller than ever expected</li>
    <li> It was much smaller than I wanted and you could not even tell that it had a light on it.</li>
    <li> Great compact mirror. Super easy to pack in a suitcase and travel with.</li>
    <li> smaller then expected</li>
