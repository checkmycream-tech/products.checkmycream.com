<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Happy with the serum. Item described very accurate</li>
    <li> I like the aloe in this. It made a decent primer for makeup.</li>
    <li> I have been using your products (both the Vitamin C Serum &amp; the Hyaluronic Acid) religiously for the past month, at least once a day, typically twice a day.  My skin is very dry and I also get bouts of Rosacea (for which I take no medication).  Since using your product I have notice that my skin is slightly softer.  But, more importantly, the redness is almost gone.  I am hoping with continued use that my skin tone will even out more, and perhaps, it may help the dark circles under my eyes (hereditary).  These are slight changes but I am not expecting miracles, especially in such a short time frame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the product and will continue to use it at this point.</li>
    <li> After using this for over a month, I did feel that my skin was a little softer. I did not notice any difference in fine lines, reduction of large pores or lightening of sun damage spots. It does go on very nicely, with no stickiness or added oil to the skin. It just isn&#x27;t providing enough benefits for me to keep using it.</li>
    <li> I really like this product and will order it again.</li>
    <li> Yes, I like the serum a lot. I definitely think it locks the moisture in, which has been a problem for me no matter what else I’ve used. So I will Definitely continue using it. Actually nothing I Dislike!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your customer service is superb.</li>
    <li> i am loving the HA.. my skin is more hydrated than it has been in years and it works well with the&lt;br /&gt;retin-a i use from my dr&#x27;s office. i like this stuff so much, i&#x27;m going to try TruSkin&#x27;s retin-a serum when i run out of my current brand.</li>
    <li> Honestly, Im not a believer of the millions of products on the market promising to diminish wrinkles and brown sun spots blah blah blah.....BUT, I will say I definately see a change in my skin in the first week of using this product at night !!! I have gotten compliments on how my skin looks brighter , more even, and softer looking in just 1 week!!!! I do use Tru Skin Vit C as well, LOVE their line of products. It is certainly cheaper to at least try one of their products Before going to one of the high end dept stores and spending your paycheck to try one of their high priced products, that contain the SAME ingredients!!:)</li>
    <li> I received my product a week ago and already see a difference in my skin.  I love this product and would highly recommend it</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! This was my first time using hyaluronic serum, ever. Immediately I noticed how soft my skin became. After using a.m. and p.m. for approximately a week or two, the little lines on my forehead were not so prominent. I started using on my neck as well and that was a very noticeable improvement. Awesome A++</li>
    <li> Fantastic moisturizer and helps even skin tone. This is the first product on my face before any other skin care product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it on a daily basis since receiving it and I do like it. I put it on right after washing and drying my face... Then I use a facial oil as moisturizer after that my friends company makes that&#x27;s a blend of 9 different high quality oils and also has flower essences too. I started using both products around the same time and have been very happy with my skin. I&#x27;m a 29 yr old mother of 1 and noticed my skin changed drastically after having my daughter. I started having dark spots pop up as well as major dryness with breaking out from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;m pleased with the product and would order again and have recommended to other friends of mine to use.</li>
    <li> I use this with vit C serum, it works great, brightening and clearing my pimples and pores are small, my oily face is no longer oily. Thank you tru skin natural for all great products, I use always high end products like lancome, useless &amp; waste of money,&lt;br /&gt;each penny worth it on tru  skin naturals products.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  My skin looks great!  I have tried others but this one is the best!  Order it...you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> Great results!  It makes my skin feel smooth.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I saw results with this product almost immediately!  My skin looks great, the fine lines are less visible, and overall my skin seems to be more radiant and firmer. I am so thrilled to find a serum that actually works, well priced and also all natural and cruelty free!&lt;br /&gt;after just 2 weeks, I knew this was a keeper and ordered 2 more bottles.  highly recommend.  I am in my late 40&#x27;s</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m already seeing clearer skin tone with the Vitamin C Serum &amp; Hyaluronic Acid after 1 week, and my eyeshadow looks so much better.  I had delicate papery skin above my eyelids and it made me look old when I wore eyeshadow.  But now my eyeshadow looks normal.  The redness in my skin has diminished as well.  I had deep wrinkles in my decollete area from sun damage &amp; age (in my 50&#x27;s), and they are gone!!!  I&#x27;m using the Vitamin C Serum &amp; the Hyaluronic Acid twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels good (mentally &amp; physically on my skin) to use healthy products that don&#x27;t have a lot of extra chemicals in them.  I&#x27;m looking forward to more benefits on my facial wrinkles over time.  I will be trying the Retinol Serum next.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful, affordable product that works.  My skin is firmer, smoother and just feels better.  I&#x27;m recommending this to my friends and telling them to buy, buy, buy!  I won&#x27;t be without it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week and already notice a difference! While I may still have some discoloration, the majority of my skin is a beautiful milky, smooth complexion. Aside from the appearance, my skin feels so healthy &amp; happy! It couples wonderfully with my rose water toner! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Like the way my face feels after I apply.</li>
    <li> I have used the Vitamin C Serum and the Hyaluronic Acid Serum.  I have combination skin with slightly more oily T Zone areas.  I have been product hopping for some time but find even the &amp;#34;oil free&amp;#34; versions of products to still be pore clogging.  I dont think it is so much the products fault but has to do with how my skin works with those products. These two products from TrueSkin work amazingly with my skin and I love it.  My only concern is, when I do find a product that my skin loves the company either changes the recipe/ingredients or they get bought out by a huge conglomerate and the product changes to make it cheaper.  PLEASE DON&#x27;T LET THIS HAPPEN!!!&lt;br /&gt;This is a fantastic product and fantastic company and will definitely buy from again. Soon after purchase I received an update email from company. I responded and answered a couple questions regarding my usage of their product. NOT a sales pitch. I told them how much I really loved their product, they then asked me since I loved the one product I bought if I was interested in trying a different product of theirs with their compliments.  The first product is working so well of course I took them up on the offer.&lt;br /&gt;I have no affiliation to this company I am how ever a person that have a very, VERY difficult time finding products that work with my skin and this product does and I want to let people know.&lt;br /&gt;The bonus is being able to communicate with the company directly.  Fantastic communication. I wish all companies had their etiquette and customer service.</li>
    <li> Love this product, my skin has improved so much, it is softer and smoother than ever before. I had a growth removed a year ago and a ridge had started to come back and guess what, this serum has smoothed it out, I&#x27;m glad I purchased two bottles as I do not want to run out ever. Thank you so much for this product, I don&#x27;t know why it took me so long to try it.</li>
    <li> There was no difference after using. I was glad there was a money back policy with that company. They were very helpful and refund my money quickly. I know all skin types are different but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I&#x27;m already seeing a difference in just 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Great product!!!  Not sure how much of a difference it would have made sooner if I used it according to the lable.  It says twice a day. I use in the morning.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I was looking for a substitute for Trish product at a better price and decided to try this based on the recommendations. After reading more I bought this and the Vitamin C serum. I use this at night and the Vitamin C serum in the morning. Follow with a light cream and then my usual makeup. My pores definitely look smaller.</li>
    <li> Your product has provided the following benefits:&lt;br /&gt;1.  My skin felt better right away&lt;br /&gt;2.  Red blotches are fading!&lt;br /&gt;3.  Forehead appears smoother.&lt;br /&gt;4.  Winkles are fading over top lip!&lt;br /&gt;5.  Laugh lines around eyes are fading!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No change yet in the puffiness under my eyes, but I am very happy with the changes so far.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just ok, could not tell it did anything for me</li>
    <li> I guess I was expecting more, but it seems to help a little and lets face it... every little bit helps.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was just my skin, but this was very drying on my skin.  I applied as directed, followed by a very good moisturizer.  Not only did it not hydrate my skin, I felt it was doing the opposite.  I tried using it with different moisturizers, but nothing helped.  My skin is pretty resilient and it did not &amp;#34;react&amp;#34; to this product:  it simply made my skin feel more dry than hydrated.</li>
    <li> 1 week in and (so far) skin seems softer! I have very dry, very sensitive skin. Will update review at the one month mark. Using with TruSkin Vitamin C serum.</li>
    <li> I have seen an improvement in my skin since I started using TruSkin Naturals.</li>
    <li> I can totally feel the difference when I don&#x27;t wear it!!! My skin is sooo soft and appears to be smoother when I wear it. I love how it feels like a smooth light veil.</li>
    <li> It works great. Highly reccomend</li>
    <li> Works great. I love it!</li>
    <li> Very good product :-)</li>
    <li> I truly love this product! My skin is already showing the difference it looks much smoother. I will definitely continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Must try, results and my friends are now using!</li>
    <li> I love this serum. I feel as if its doing more to help clear acne and close pores than years of acne creams have. I used this at night and an consistently awed by how good my skin looks in the AM. I use this after washing and toner. I use a natural moisturizer with a dab of jojoba oil. Keeping the skin moisturized seems to be key.</li>
    <li> after using skin ceuticals i dont know how one can give this 5 stars!&lt;br /&gt;this is not the same hyaluronic acid i used in skin ceuticals&lt;br /&gt;it is not liquid, it likes a gel and it has no tingling effect&lt;br /&gt;i am not sure if it works at all</li>
    <li> works great, 2 weeks in and bags under my eyes are considerably reduced</li>
    <li> Still very happy with the outcome and the softness of my skin.  Not bad for a 75+ years young female.  As we all know, as we age we lose the elasticity in our skin.  That is what aging does for you, and your products are helping me to have healthier looking skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dot</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product daily now for about 2 months. My skin feels tight after putting it on, but I don&#x27;t really see any difference in the appearance if my skin. I&#x27;m in my late 50&#x27;s and this may be why it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t reorder, saw no difference</li>
    <li> Great product. Looks skin look great.</li>
    <li> This is seriously the best serum I&#x27;ve tried. Superior product!</li>
    <li> I love this product! This serum actually lives up to its promises. I have purchased other products for my face/skin...usually with very little or no&lt;br /&gt;Expected results.  I am in my late 50&#x27;s and rarely used sunblock and also a previous smoker..so the lines and wrinkles were somewhat prominent and the Hyaluronic acid serum is reversing that damage to my skin!!! I was amazed especially because I was skeptical that it would do as promised. Try it!!! It works...my skin is smoother, healthier looking and I receive compliments daily, I have been asked several times where to buy it because people see the results on me!! The customer service at TruSkin Naturals  is also awesome..I was contacted by email from Erica&lt;br /&gt;Asking how I liked it and if it was working for me. Customer service means a lot to me! I have NEVER reviewed anything before but I wanted to&lt;br /&gt;Express to anyone thinking of purchasing this to do so immediately...because it is amazing..</li>
    <li> At my age, there are no miracle serums, only surgical procedures.</li>
    <li> I really like the serum. I am very pleased with the way my skin feels, and the fact that it did not break my skin out, as it is very sensitive. Also, and this was very important in my decision to purchase, the serum is cruelty free/not tested on animals (and I can assure you I would NOT have purchased if it had not been…everything I use on my face and my hair is cruelty free).&lt;br /&gt;I really like it and I will be reordering soon!</li>
    <li> Very good. I have bought it again</li>
    <li> I just started in the last three weeks to use this product and I find my skin feeling smoother and less lines. it is working.</li>
    <li> Very happy with service and products.  Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> The serum’s I have ordered have worked very well for me.  My skin is much clearer and softer since I began using TruSkin.  I am glad I finally found something natural and something that actually works.  I will keep ordering as long as you are still selling it.</li>
    <li> Works well, and is not sticky.  Seems to work well.</li>
    <li> I just began using this product and am very impressed.  I use it as the manufacturer suggested on website; morning Vitamin C with usual moisturizer and at night the Hyaluronic Acid under night cream.  Skin so far feels very supple and looks great.  I am equally impressed with TruSkin as a company as I received a bottle of Hyaluronic Acid which for some reason was very low in product.  Outside of bottle was damp but no leakage in packaging so I assumed it had come from the manufacturer that way.  I returned product to Amazon and reordered; I also wrote feedback to Amazon regarding the reason for return.  The next day I received an e-mail from a rep from TruSkin who apologized for the shortage and asked for an address to send a complimentary bottle to.  They did not need to do that-I was merely offering feedback-but nonetheless I was very impressed with their follow up and customer service.  This, in my opinion, is the way to do business.  Provide a great product such as the Hyaluronic Acid and combine it with class-act customer service...six stars!</li>
    <li> I have struggled with acne and uneven skin tone since I hit puberty (I am now 27). I recently got of my birth control for the first time in 10 years and my skin has been so bad ever since. Hormonal acne all around my jaw line and chin. I&#x27;m really good a picking too, so I have serious dark spots from scarring. I&#x27;ve only been using this product for 3 days and I seriously can&#x27;t express how thankful I am that I came across this item. My roommate, who is a man, came into my room this morning and was amazed how much better my skin looked. Truly and amazing product. It must be bc I have never written a review for anything before. But I take my skin seriously bc it has caused me a lot of grief, so if this review helps convince someone who is struggling with acne to buy it, then that makes me happy! and it&#x27;s all natural and organic!! My dream has come true:)</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic, and delivered visible results within 3 days of use. My die-hard, no cosmetics, no chemicals South German husband who is used to extremely high quality organic skin care products, has noticed such a difference already, HE is seriously considering using this serums as well. We also love the fact that TruSkin is an authentic, all American company &amp; their product line is manufactured &amp; adheres to the strictest of standards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality is amazing-thank you all @ Truskin for creating this line!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product along with the C Serum for two to three months and I absolutely love how my skin looks and feels.  I will continue to order this product. Quality ingredients and the product does what it says!!!</li>
    <li> the first two times I bought this product, I liked it very much.  However, the last time I got it, it was totally different!  The consistency was liquid instead of the serum it had previously been.  Also, it irritates my skin.  I won&#x27;t buy this product anymore!</li>
    <li> Love the pump dispenser.  My &amp;#34;beauty routine&amp;#34; is absolutely zilch.  I&#x27;ve earned all the wrinkles on my face.  But every now and then I would like to not look so tired and worn out.  I tried it before bed the day it arrived.  One little pump onto my hand spread easily over face, neck, and upper chest.  I NOTICED A DIFFERENCE THE NEXT MORNING!  Seems to be the fact that as it dries, it tightens the skin.  It’s not a lasting change, but then what is?  I haven’t gotten any compliments as of yet, but I see the difference.  I don&#x27;t follow it with anything else, and I haven&#x27;t worn makeup in 20 years.  But my skin is smoother and tighter after it dries.  If you&#x27;d like alil pick me up, try it out.</li>
    <li> It works! Even on sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> So far, I&#x27;m loving the serums. I like the way they go on and how they feel under my usual moisturizers. I see some fading of the dark &amp;#34;sun&amp;#34; spots on my face which is what I was particularly hoping for. Hopefully with longer use the wrinkles will start to diminish as well! Thanks for a great product and great customer service!</li>
    <li> I have been using TruSkin Hyaluronic Acid Serum along with their Vitamin C Serum and Retinol Moisturizer for approximately 6 months now. I can see a huge difference in the brightness of my skin, and a tremendous decrease in the color of my dark spots. My wrinkles are also less noticeable. So, I certainly will continue to use these products; they&#x27;re terrific!</li>
    <li> Love this product as a new consumer.  Really hydrated my face after a few uses.  Very happy with it- will continue to use it.  I also have very sensitive, dry skin.  This has helped moisturizing my face and I use it before my regular moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Honestly didn&#x27;t seem to do much...and the consistency is VERY thin.  Spray mechanism is somewhat awkward.  Not terrible, but I do use a different brand now that seems to work much better by comparison.  See my other reviews for more info.</li>
    <li> Did not notice any difference in my skin after using the entire product.</li>
    <li> I just reordered the TruSkin Naturals Product in a larger size.  It is working very well and I love the Hyaluronic Acid. The serum is not sticky or oily and dries quickly on my face, neck, and decollete.  I would definitely recommend this product for smoother firmer skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent costumer service and amazing products!</li>
    <li> I love hyaluronic serums they are so moisturizing I have cheated and tried other brands that are cheaper but you get what u pay for This is the best . It rich plus you get the added benefit of vitamin C,E  I use it twice a day followed by vitamin c serum,(has really made a difference in the aging skin) followed by moisturizer and of course most important sunscreen. Try it! 6/8/15 update recently purchased again 2 sets of 3, had to return ALL of them  , they must have changed their formula because these all smelled like vinegar and we&#x27;re so thin and watery in the consistency  compared to they used to be thick/rich like a good serum is supposed to. I will continue with the use of HA but not this brand they are very good for your skin,you don,t have to apply as moisturizer if you use them, I do twice aday.</li>
    <li> I only noticed a slight difference in my fine lines from this serum, but I have to be fair and say I am not consistently using it.  I&#x27;ve found with this, and the last hyaluronic Acid treatment I tried, it tends to make my pores bigger and skin more oily.  Could be it&#x27;s not the right ingredient for someone like me, who still has oily skin and occasional blemish in middle age.</li>
    <li> I recieved within 3 days of placing my order, I was very impressed how fast it shipped.  I have only used this product for 3 days and my skin already looks and feels so much smoother.  I would very much recomend this product.</li>
    <li> I love it. It makes my face feel moisturized and firm!</li>
    <li> It took me a second purchase to figure this out, but the serum is better suited to someone with oily skin, not mature/dry skin like mine (I&#x27;m 43). I have no doubt that the ingredients are of high quality. However, I can&#x27;t afford money or timewise to own too many skin care products. I don&#x27;t want to have to put an additional moisturizer on after using the serum. So I think I&#x27;m going to go back to eminence organics strawberry rhubarb serum. It&#x27;s way more expensive, but I wake up in the mornings with dewy skin.</li>
    <li> I find this product very effective in hydrating my dry skin. I layer it with my vitamin C serum (they work together beautifully) and when the weather is cold and my skin is especially dry,I find that if I pat a small amount with my fingertips over my makeup, I look instantly refreshed.I am now on my second bottle and I will order again!</li>
    <li> I love this product and seller. !!! I have ordered multiple times.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It get here right away.</li>
    <li> FEELS GOOD AND HELPS CONTROL ACNE</li>
    <li> I really love my serum. I saw tremendous change in my skin..before it was dull..now, it&#x27;s really nice and bright and looks youthful...even without make up! I love it!</li>
    <li> Started using this product about 10 days ago and have seen great results. I put it on before bed and when I wake up in the morning, crows feet and smile creases are definitely smoothed out. My skin looks healthier and more youthful, even more hydrated. Only takes a little bit and no annoying smells. Recommend for anyone wanting to decrease existing wrinkles or get a head start on keeping future wrinkles at bay. I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> The stars for the product which didn&#x27;t show too much of a difference on my dry skin. However, the COMPANY deserves FIVE stars as they wrote me multiple time to see how I liked the product and were concerned and communicative about my experience with it. please order from this company they are so sweet and thoughtful!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not seeing the difference I had hoped it wouldn&#x27;t accomplish</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a dude, but I enjoy this stuff and it&#x27;s ability to help my skin from drying out</li>
    <li> I like Truskin Naturals products because I&#x27;ve always had problems with breaking out and their vitamin c serum has made my skin so much better. I hoped that the hyaluronic acid would work for me too, and it does!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels cool and refreshing going on and so far it&#x27;s working with the c serum really well. I was using the c serum twice a day but now I&#x27;m only using it in the morning and the hyaluronic acid at night which is actually making the c serum last longer. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and overall my skin looks and feels healthier and more moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure about the pump at first because I like the control of an eyedropper, but I like it a lot! It&#x27;s really easy to use and pumps out just enough to quickly cover my entire face. I&#x27;m so glad I found this company!</li>
    <li> I really love this product since it made my skin glow which is why I bought a second one before I even finished my first bottle. Sadly, the second one was different. It was watery and was scented which was completely different from the first product I got. I hope TruSkin Naturals can address this issue.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past week; I put it on at night 5 minutes before I put on my night cream. I&#x27;m 53, so battling wrinkles is a priority and this product really seems to work!</li>
    <li> I LOVE how this makes my skin feel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another 5 star product from Truskin Naturals! I tried different hyaluronic acid serums in the past but they all caused me to breakout so I had to stop -- Not with this one though! I have been using it for 3 weeks now and no breakouts!! I also use their vitamin c serum and I LOVE how soft and healthy my skin looks and feels!!</li>
    <li> I am in love with the serum! My skin looks amazing!! Last week I had a really bad sunburn I forgot to put sunscreen and the only thing I applied was the serum, my skin looks and feels great. I will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love the vitamin C serum of this company so I decided to buy the huyaluronic acid serum as well. WOW! I usually have dry spots on my combination skin face but not anymore. I have been using it for 5 months now and even after travelling intercontinental in different time zones and climates my skin remained hydrated and smooth. Is a stable in my routine I use it every night under my cream. I purchased the retinol serum from them which I find very good as well. My skin is sensitive so I use the retinol only 3 nights a week. That is a very good honest company that sells great products in great prices. Thank you TruSkin Naturals!!</li>
    <li> Easy to purchase and I am pleased with the product.  I use it with the Vitamin C product.</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love!  Finally a hyaluronic acid product that works wonders.  I&#x27;m using along with the Vitamin C product from the same line and I&#x27;ve only used these both for a week and already see the difference in my skin. I have really good skin with minimal wrinkles for a 58 year old but this has definitely improved the texture, tone and brightened the clarity of my skin.  I&#x27;m trying them both on the back of my hands to see if they will help the spots so I will comment on this later.  Love, love, love these two products!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I use the TruSkin Naturals Hyaluronic Acid serum at night and the TruSkin Naturals Vitamin C Serum in the morning.  This product goes on easy, and it moisturizes and plumps my skin very nicely.  I am 45 years old, and I am usually assumed to be in my early 30s.  Need I say more....?</li>
    <li> I have only had the product a week but I can tell that it is moisturizing my skin and gentle for my face, so I feel that it will perform as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;Also I read some reviews stating that they did not put it under their eyes but I do with no bad effects.  I can see why the product says to use the H Acid at night and Vitamin C in the AM.because the H Acid really is a supple moisture rich product  and might be too much moisturizer under makeup depending on your skin type. I am truly glad I found these products, the H Acid and the Vitamin C serum and will purchase them again, hopefully the price will remain affordable.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product!  It works well as an anti-aging product, but I am using it to diminish stretch marks on my skin.  It has done an amazing job reducing redness and has even smoothed the skin.  I have already ordered more!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this.  She is in her early sixties and feels her skin is far better now than before she started with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to agree shell&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> So far, so good.  I&#x27;m very happy with the serum. I&#x27;ve been telling everyone about this product.</li>
    <li> This serum is working great for me....my skin is softer and looks somewhat more luminous.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Not greasy or oily on my skin.  And I love that the product is not filled with parabens and so much of it is natural and/or organic.</li>
    <li> When I saw that TruSkin Naturals added this product to their existing line, I had to try it.  I have been using their Vitamin C Serum for a while now and have been very happy with the results.  The Hyaluronic Acid is the perfect addition to my skin regimen.  I use it in the morning under my makeup and am very pleased that it smooths out the fine lines that used to show.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems with my sensitive skin while using this product.&lt;br /&gt;I am definitely a big fan and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Fast service..great customer follow up. I noticed a smoother appearance just after the first 3 applications..highly recommended and will continue to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> I started noticing the difference after a couple of days of using this product.  I have been using it for over 2 weeks now and my face looks brighter, smoother and the pores seem smaller.  Haven&#x27;t notice any changes on the fine lines yet.  I use it in the morning under make up and at night after shower.  I wait for a few minutes then apply a moisturizer.  I noticed a strange smell at the the beginning but can&#x27;t smell it anymore after a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a 50% off promo card for my next purchase.  I ordered another bottle online but the system would not accept the promo code,  I ordered it anyways.  It is only 1 oz. in the bottle, won&#x27;t last long .  Very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Although the serum felt good on my skin and felt like it was receiving extra hydration, I can&#x27;t say that I say any visible difference in the fine lines or plumpness.  Perhaps I was expecting too much</li>
    <li> I really saw a difference with this serum.  My skin looked more even and more plump.  I recommend.  Half the price of others I have tried too!</li>
    <li> Love it!! Great results</li>
    <li> I am using both the Vitamin C serum and Hyaluronic and am very pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 6 months and my face and skin feels great. The fine lines have started to diminish and I get many complements on how beautiful my skin is. Thanks. Correne</li>
    <li> I really like this serum, it does hydrate but absorbs quickly  doesn&#x27;t break me out and I do think my skin looks better, I ordered another one that&#x27;s how much I like it, I try a lot of different products out but I rarely find one that I feel I have to repurchase. This is a keeper. I can&#x27;t claim that it worked miracles or anything but I have found my serum and from everything I have read these vit and the acid are must have for a good skin care routine.Thanks for a great product and for great service!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this stuff. My skin is so soft after 2 weeks I can&#x27;t believe it. I&#x27;ve turned my Mom onto this stuff and she is in love as well.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product along with TruSkin Vitamin C serum.  I use the vitamin C on my face in the morning, followed by moisturizer.  At night I put the hyaluronic acid on my cleansed face, followed by retinol night cream.  I have been following this routine for several weeks.  My skin is much softer with less dry patches on my forehead.  The age spots have also faded somewhat.  I hope to see continued improvement in the coming months.</li>
    <li> this is a great product works great .</li>
    <li> Not only is it affordable compared to its much more expensive competitors - it works as well or better ----I have so often heard from estheticians that if you are not using a Hyaluronic Acid product you are missing the boat - I love it and the price</li>
    <li> This works! Fine lines, overall softness and even tone of skin results from regular use.</li>
    <li> Used for about 3 weeks now. Have noticed facial skin not as dry and scaly looking. Product is nice texture, not runny.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! Very light so doesn&#x27;t make my face feel oily. It&#x27;s been helping my skin look better after a few weeks even in this harsh winter on the East Coast! The customer service is like no other. They followed up with me to see how I liked the product. More businesses should operate like this. TruSkin Naturals really cares about their customers! Will definitely be buying again!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product along with the Vitamin C. I mix the two in my palm and apply. My facial skin is very smooth and post menopausal acne free. Even my eastician noticed a difference! I use the extra mix on the back of my hands!  WOW! Age spots are disappearing and my hands look younger! BONUS! I am going to try the Retinol serum alternating with &amp;#34; the mix &amp;#34;. Stay tuned!</li>
    <li> gotta wait to see on this one</li>
    <li> I use this at night after wash my face and then I use Lumene night cream.. love them both, am I use the c serm and the Lumenne bb cream.</li>
    <li> I love the serum it&#x27;s amazing. I&#x27;ve been using it for the past two three weeks and it has done wonders on my skin, especially in helping remove my acne scars and brightening my face. I&#x27;m actually planning on ordering it again very soon since both me and my mom use it. It&#x27;s a must buy!!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I had a severe burn on my cheek and applying this product made the healing process much smoother and faster than just leaving it with a moisture cream. Highly recommend this serum.</li>
    <li> I am using this in combination with the Vitamin C and am really seeing a difference already after just a few short weeks! I will continue to purchase and use this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bobbi H</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a few weeks (3 weeks to be exact) now consistently and I love it!! I really do think its better than all serums that I&#x27;ve tried so far... I especially love this for priming my skin for make up. Also I use this day and night as like a base for my moisturizer or as a base for my make up. I especially noticed a difference when my skin had dry patches in the winter months, I was in desperation to find something to clear up my dry patches because of the fact that I&#x27;ve been using a ton of cleansers for my acne prone skin which really dried up my face With the winter month made my skin even more drier. A few uses of this and my dry patches have been almost completely gone or has lessened significantly. this serum has almost a liquid consistency and absorbs quickly into your skin. I do recommend giving this a try. I do use more than one pump just to get that extra moisture and it sinks into my skin without making it feel heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway this is off topic but I do want to recommend anyone with acne prone skin to use Apple cider vinegar the raw unpasteurized kind and use it as a toner after you cleanse your face. I&#x27;ve been doing this every day and night and have been applying this serum after doing so and my acne has significantly decreased. I&#x27;m just happy I&#x27;ve found something to really help my skin clear up because it has been such a struggle.</li>
    <li> I really like it, my face feel so good!&lt;br /&gt;I live it for a few minutes, and after I put my face cram.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have been extremely pleased with the products and do plan on purchasing more once I am through with what I currently have.  I do notice less wrinkles, especially around my eyes.  It also helps that since I have sensitive skin that your products do not cause any facial irritation.</li>
    <li> No kidding when it said it&#x27;s the best! I always have acne and old scars problem, but this is hands down my savior. It works like a charm. I can see my skin is getting better and better every morning, and there&#x27;s no better feeling than that! Can&#x27;t love and appreciate this product more!</li>
    <li> I have been usingTruSkin Naturals Hyaluronic Acid Serum for a short while and I absolutely love it! It makes my skin feel so soft and smooth. I used to use all those advertised skin creams but they all felt so thick and heavy on my skin. This goes on so quick and easy. I use it in the morning and at night. I alternate between the Hyaluronic Acid Serum and the Vitamin C Serum and I LOVE the results. It is slowly fading my &amp;#34;age freckles&amp;#34;  and softening those pesky wrinkles. :)  Thanks so much for an incredible and super product. The fact that it is a natural product is greatly appreciated.</li>
    <li> it is one of the best product I have ever used</li>
    <li> I really like this product. Did not dry my skin out, as a boomer aging is faster than I prefer always looking for skin treatments to slow down the process and provide the moisture needed to lessen the wrinkle look. With its list of age related fixes I feel this product is helping.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about a month. I haven&#x27;t seen spectacular results, but have seen subtle differences such as skin texture and resiliency. I am hoping that with continued use that the results will increase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Sharon Reynolds</li>
    <li> I did not like it, did not notice any difference in my skin at all</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after I used their Vitamin C serum..I love this company and the natural products they produce. I have only been using it for the last week but I like its consistency and the way it absorbs into my skin and leaves my skin fresh and not greasy.  I will continue to use this and hope to see an ongoing improvement in my skin since using it morning and night.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  doesn&#x27;t make my face oily which a lot of products tend to do.  I can&#x27;t use it all over my face including eye lids &amp; under eyes.  a couple of drops easily covers face &amp; hands.</li>
    <li> Love how it feels on my face. It absorbs quickly. I use the TruNaturals Vitamin C serum first, then follow it with Hylaronic Acid and Retinol Serum, then moisturizer. The included instructions were appreciated: I have reordered and will continue to order this product. My skin looks and fees great.. I just ordered all 3 serums for my husband because he is jealous of how good my skin looks.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and I love that the serum is metered out by the pump, instead of the eye dropper. I tried both products The vitamin C and the Hyaluronic Acid and I think this one works better for me but they are both great products.</li>
    <li> Love this serum. Does as advertised.</li>
    <li> Skin more supple, good for sensitive skin</li>
    <li> the best for your face with great results</li>
    <li> I use this with the vitamin c serum, i feel like it helps with fine lines and eyes. I usually apply to those areas at night and i look so awake i the morning!</li>
    <li> This is a great anti aging product....Hyaluronic Acid is a great addition to my daily beauty routine.  I also use the Vitamin C serum and in combination these are two products that will always be in my daily skin care cache.  I can see an improvement in brightness and wrinkle reduction on my face, throat and décolleté.  I would recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> This is the second bottle that I have ordered.  This is a gel like product that does not run and is absorbed well into the face.  It is not sticky or oily and my lancome foundation goes on smoothly. I will order this on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> My skin has never felt so soft and looked this good. The product is very light and easy to apply. I use it with their Vic C serum and it seems to be a good combination</li>
    <li> After I received a bad first bottle they immediately sent me a complimentary bottle. I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over a week. It tightens my skin and makes my skin glow. I use it on my chest where I have lots of sun damage. It is the best it&#x27;s looked in over 10 years!</li>
    <li> awesome serum, i love it</li>
    <li> Truly plumps up skin!  I use this on top of my Vitamin  C or my Retinol (also from Truskin Naturals) and i wake up with smooth, poreless looking skin.  Don&#x27;t even have to put on foundation anymore.  ME!  No foundation!!!!  My skin is so moisturized and soft.  This is a very clean feeling serum, sinks into skin immediately, no greasy feeling or the feel of something on your skin.  It just feels like you have nothing on and wake up to smooth line free skin.  Honestly, these are the only 3 products you ever need for aging or even acne prone skin.  The bottles are a good size and all you need is a drop or two for your entire face.  I&#x27;m so glad i found this company. You should run and get this!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll let you know how it actually works, but so far I like it. I&#x27;m not sure why though. :)</li>
    <li> Product received timely. Sale price even better! Goes on smooth, no shine seen on my oily face type. Definitely, a GO!</li>
    <li> This product  by far is one of the best. I have tried many in the past and this serum makes my skin look and feel great! I am very happy with my purchase!!!</li>
    <li> I bought the Vitamin C, Hyaluronic Acid, and Retinol Serum.  I&#x27;ve been using all 3 for a week, and I must say I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my skin!  I have a pesky brown spot near my cheek, and I&#x27;ve noticed it&#x27;s getting lighter.  The color of my skin is brighter, not as dull.  I use the it c and hyaluronic acid twice a day and the retinol at night.  My skin is not oil, they absorb quick without a sticky feel.  I can wear them under my makeup.  No dryness, no redness.  These are great products!! And you can&#x27;t beat the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, when the Hyaluronic Acid arrived, it had leaked and was thinner than other reviews had mentioned.  Shortly after I ordered, I received an email from Erica, Co-Founder of TruSkin Naturals.  First off, I didn&#x27;t expect to get an email from the company.  When I replied telling her about the leakage and the formula, she responded very quickly and sent a new bottle.  She was in constant contact with me and made me feel valued as a customer.  What fantastic business ethic!  It&#x27;s rare to see that these days.</li>
    <li> I am happy using it and will reorder soon</li>
    <li> I love this serum. I put it on at night and the Vitamin C serum on in the morning with my moisturizer cream and my face feels so nice and smooth. I purchased this about 2 weeks ago and I can already see the results of the lines under my eyes lightening.</li>
    <li> the first bottle I bought seemed to be effective,  helped to even out skin tone and moisturize, the consistency was a gel, but when I order a second bottle, what I got was a bottle of scented water that doesn&#x27;t do anything, what a rip off!</li>
    <li> I love these products!  I have tried a lot of very EXPENSIVE products too but these are the best so far! I&#x27;m starting to see a change in the fine lines around my eyes after just a couple weeks! I love that it has NO perfume or smell. So clean feeling and absorbs quickly. These products are now on my &amp;#34;Must Have&amp;#34; list! I have already recommended these to friends!&lt;br /&gt;Megan Schnall</li>
    <li> Its not what I&#x27;ve expected.</li>
    <li> I bought this to pair with the vitamin C serum and I am very happy with my purchase. My skin looks so much better after a couple of days and I&#x27;m in LOVE! 😍&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now a TruSkin VIP because they&#x27;re products deliver on their promises! This stuff is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had a problem with my skin but now that I turned 35 I think it&#x27;s time to help my skin fight the aging process. My pores have disappeared in just a couple of applications &amp; I couldn&#x27;t be happier! 😃&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love TruSkin Naturals!</li>
    <li> It is very very good, but y am using it just for 3 wecks,so i have to wait a little longer,but so far mi face id much better.</li>
    <li> Seeing improvement in fine lines in the 4 weeks I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
    <li> Using it from last one month or more,some results seen.</li>
    <li> Wear it every day and my skin is showing improvement, fine lines and wrinkles less noticeable.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin glow, does not cause irritation even if applied after a chemical peel,  no smell which is good</li>
    <li> I have been using Truskin vitamin c serum as part of my morning routine for months now and absolutely love it! When I saw their new hyaluronic acid I just had to try it. The first thing I noticed is how much thicker the consistency is. It is hard to explain, it&#x27;s almost a gel, but not quite. The pump is nice and convenient too and it dispenses the perfect amount on my finger tip without splattering or dripping like I&#x27;ve experienced with other serums with pumps. It feels really nice going on too, and it spreads well so a little goes a long way. I&#x27;ve been using it in the evening before bed for 2 weeks now and my face looks so refreshed and awake in the morning!</li>
    <li> After a visit to a medical spa, I made the mistake of trying a supposedly &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; product for freckle removal.  I have sensitive skin, and had a severe reaction which caused redness, severe swelling, and flaking.  Everything I tried stung; CereVe facial moisturizer, Philosophy&#x27;s Hope In a Jar, even natural aloe vera straight from the plant.  It took me a few days before I would attempt anything else.  I had ordered this product prior to my reaction, and knew from my experience with another formula produced by this company that their stuff was very gentle and made my skin smooth and supple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took two applications - once at night, and once the next morning - for my flakiness to disappear.  I could not believe the near instant change.  There was no stinging, and my redness and puffiness subsided soon after.  I know my skin would have recovered anyway, but this product really gave it a boost, particularly with my flakiness/dryness, and without the irritation associated with the other products I had tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is mildly scented and in the form of a clear gel.  It spreads evenly and dries quickly without stickiness.  It layers well under sunblock and makeup.  It appears that this formula is packed with all gentle, natural ingredients in addition to hyaluronic acid and vitamin C, like witch hazel, aloe, and jojoba oil.  I am hooked!  I only wish that this product came in larger sizes.</li>
    <li> So far I really like the serum.  I think the color and clarity of my skin is overall improved.  I haven&#x27;t always been as consistent as I need to be when following instructions but I have done a good job using both the serum and hyaluronic acid 2x&#x27;s daily.  I love how easy both products are to apply.  They both have a nice consistency and fragrance.  Both products absorb well leaving my skin feeling clean and no overly processed.  So far I&#x27;m impressed and I think you have a great product.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sensitive skin and for my rosacea. I have spent thousands and thousands on doctors, skin care regimes, and books over the years. I hated using products on my face that had ingredients in them that I could not pronounce, or that sounded like chemicals used in industry. I am very happy with this product. So far, so good! It has helped with the redness and scaliness of my rosacea. After oil cleansing my face with a concoction I came up with after doing much research, I spray my face with rose water, and then use this serum. I still have to use on of the less evasive prescription products I have once in a great while. I will recommend this serum to anyone, especially with rosacea.</li>
    <li> Good face beatiful serum.</li>
    <li> My bottle must have been half empty when received, there wasn&#x27;t a seal on the top.  I&#x27;ve only used it for a week and the bottle is already empty. There seems to be some improvement in my skin but product did not last long enough to tell.</li>
    <li> so far it is living up to my expectations</li>
    <li> A truly great facial product! My skin is much softer and beginning to firm up at 58 years old</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not that impressed by it.  It seems to be watered down quite a bit compared to others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I really LOOOVE this product. It is fantastic,light, and you can see a positive difference and radiance on your skin. Combine with a good organic mineral sun block during the day though. I absolutely recommend this serum.</li>
    <li> I keep using it and nothing is happening.  I don&#x27;t understand.  It was supposed to make me gorgeous.  :(</li>
    <li> Have not used it every day. but I ave seen a difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> I have had No Results with this product what so ever after 1 month of use.  I will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I use it at night and my skin feel so rejuvenated in the morning. I put it all over my face even over my eyelids. It&#x27;s very light and dries quickly so I can put my regular moisturizer over it and it does not feel heavy like a lots of layer over my skin. I feel my skin has gotten firmer and I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Arrived as promised &amp; in stated condition.</li>
    <li> Wow! I honestly can not be more pleased with this product.  Something created for beauty ...that actually works. I was given a sample of this and I am amazed by how nice my skin feels, and looks. I live in the high desert...where it&#x27;s dry. You have to have good skin care here.  The truskin products actually really work. My skin feels smoother, supple, and healthier looking with a glow.  I don&#x27;t think any other product I have ever tried...and I mean all of those high end department store creams that cost soooo much...work as well as this product here.  The customer service is great if you have any questions and they truly stand behind the product with no monthly billing to hassle you.  This is a great product you can buy when you want and need it and not worry about all of the monthly bills and auto crap these other sellers make you do to try something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product and the other truskin product Vitamin C serum every morning and night with my moisturizer.  I SEE and FEEL a big difference since using these.  Thank you to this amazing company offering an affordable product that really works!</li>
    <li> Love it. I had some dry patches on my cheeks due to the winter and after 3 days of using it, they were gone and my skin was back to it&#x27;s dewy glow!</li>
    <li> Saw some benefit to my skin.</li>
    <li> Nice, but no remarkable changes.</li>
    <li> This is another serum that didn&#x27;t do much for me either...will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have used this product several.  It is great for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Really great serum.  It definitely gives my skin a nice glow. It&#x27;s the first thing I use in the morning and it really does a better job that makeup.  I highly recommend this.  Great seller too.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I have been using it for a while now and a few people at work has started to say I am looking great.  What have I done differently. I am 50 years old and can pass as early 40&#x27;s.  I absolutely love this product. I have always looked young for my age, but since I turned 48 no one was telling me I looked young.  Now that I am 50 (51 this year) and a week after I started using this product, they all started telling me again.  Go ahead, think I&#x27;m crazy?  It&#x27;s working for me.</li>
    <li> I use this every night, my skin looks my radiant and it helps diminish fine line.</li>
    <li> I bought this product a few times and it was good, but this time it was a liquid such as water and did not look like the usual sticky serum</li>
    <li> I am 43 and I look like I did when I was 35. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Indeed this is GREAT!  It&#x27;s so good that after a couple of applications, I ordered my second bottle.  I use it in the AM as well as PM.  When I apply it to my face, I feel it slightly tight which makes my wrinkles less noticeable.  True to it&#x27;s word &amp;#34;It hydrates and plumps skin to fill in fine lines and wrinkles.&amp;#34;  I&#x27;ve also noticed my pores have diminished and my face is glowing.  Sometimes I combine it with Jojoba oil (even though it already has Jojoba) or Maracuja oil.  Review is given by the Mrs.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! Goes on easily, and seems to be having a positive effect on skin tone and age spots. I will order it again.</li>
    <li> I have purchased both the vitamin C and this Hyaluronic Acid Serum, I love the compliments I get on my skin, my Dr. said I look younger than my daughter, of course she is now using it also. we both love it and recommend it highly.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried about every wrinkle product, this is the only one I absolutely love!!!</li>
    <li> I started using this product over a month ago and I really love the difference in my skin!</li>
    <li> Very good product. Use it with the vitamin C serum. Face feels so soft and actually looking better. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> i can&#x27;t feel dramatic difference!</li>
