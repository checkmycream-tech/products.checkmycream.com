      <li>Great item.</li>
      <li>I was so happy with his RESTORE product for my aging hair that I had to try the shampoo and conditioner.  </li>

      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>its ok.</li>
      <li>This conditioner is the greatest, I started using JF products last year after a Dr on a TV show recommended it.</li>
      <li>Originally bought this product thru the special of  the week on Good Morning America.  </li>
      <li>and it goes on easily</li>
      <li>it gets duller/lifeless - this is full of vitamins making it lustrous/stronger &amp; more youthful -</li>
      <li>Which is a problem for fine hair.</li>
      <li>It is absolutely worth the price!</li>
      <li>, didnt see it do anything special .</li>
      <li>the Vitamin Restore was ok after i washed off the mess, but there should have been some kind of top to apply it.  </li>
      <li>My hair looks healthy , shiny &amp;  feels and looks much thicker.</li>
      <li>I have tried many, many hair products and finally found the product line I will continue to use.  </li>
      <li>I finally feel that my hair has been returned to a youthful look and most importantly is healthy.</li>
      <li>, i am back to Kerastase, much better !</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did, and I&#x27;m now a regular customer!</li>
      <li>I saw it advertized on Good Morning America a few months ago and thought I would give this line of hair care products a try.  </li>
      <li>I have tried countless conditioners and this is the first one that leaves my hair manageable and soooooo easy to comb/brush.  </li>
      <li>I think this product line has really improved my hair&#x27;s appearance, texture and strength.</li>
      <li>I received product with seal removed, I don&#x27;t feel this product is the real deal.</li>
      <li>I really like this for color treated hair</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair feeling moisturized and manageable, with a subtle and pleasant scent.  </li>
      <li>Great product -but expensive for the amount you get</li>
      <li>I use color treated, she uses normal.</li>
      <li>It was a huge mess.  </li>
      <li>for all the higher priced shampoos as well as cheaper ones promising all the same benefits - this one actually works!</li>
      <li>Conditioner doesn&#x27;t make my fine hair heavy.  </li>
      <li>In all fairness, i called Amazon and they refunded me completely immediately.  </li>
      <li>I tried all of his product and the only correct one is the restore, but it takes sooooooo much time to rinse it that i gave up on it</li>
      <li>Made my hair so soft and shiny. AAA+++</li>

    <li> Great product -but expensive for the amount you get</li>
    <li> Conditioner doesn&#x27;t make my fine hair heavy.  Which is a problem for fine hair. I can use it every day</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic!  It leaves my hair feeling moisturized and manageable, with a subtle and pleasant scent.  I saw it advertized on Good Morning America a few months ago and thought I would give this line of hair care products a try.  I&#x27;m so glad I did, and I&#x27;m now a regular customer!</li>
    <li> Great item. Made my hair so soft and shiny. AAA+++</li>
    <li> This conditioner is the greatest, I started using JF products last year after a Dr on a TV show recommended it. My hair looks healthy , shiny &amp;  feels and looks much thicker.</li>

    <li> It made me break out.</li>
    <li> I have tried many, many hair products and finally found the product line I will continue to use.  The search is over!  I was so happy with his RESTORE product for my aging hair that I had to try the shampoo and conditioner.  I couldn&#x27;t have been more pleased.  I finally feel that my hair has been returned to a youthful look and most importantly is healthy.</li>
    <li> I received product with seal removed, I don&#x27;t feel this product is the real deal. I believe for what I paid for the conditioner and shampoo, you can find other products out there that deliver. I will not be purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> Made my hair feel dirty</li>
    <li> My hair feels thicker with the shampoo and conditioner but not shinier as promised.</li>
    <li> I love this product. My daughter and I both use it. I use color treated, she uses normal. But, when she borrows mine, she doesn&#x27;t notice a difference, so either one works. Shiny hair.. etc... etc.. love it</li>
    <li> No different than any other product</li>
    <li> I have long hair and have always had problems with tangles. I have tried countless conditioners and this is the first one that leaves my hair manageable and soooooo easy to comb/brush.  I even sent my mother a bottle.  It is absolutely worth the price!</li>
    <li> Originally bought this product thru the special of  the week on Good Morning America.  I really like this for color treated hair and it goes on easily</li>
    <li> I ordered the Julien Farel Vitamin Shampoo, Conditioner and Vitamin Restore.  I opened the package and it was all over the place.  It was a huge mess.  So i couldn&#x27;t use the shampoo or conditioner.  the Vitamin Restore was ok after i washed off the mess, but there should have been some kind of top to apply it.  It didn&#x27;t come with it, so I have yet to use it.  I can&#x27;t speak about the products, but the shipping of the products stunk.  In all fairness, i called Amazon and they refunded me completely immediately.  I am hesitant to reorder through Amazon again, though.</li>
    <li> I use this condition with the shampoo and every other time include the Restore product.  I think this product line has really improved my hair&#x27;s appearance, texture and strength.</li>
    <li> its ok., didnt see it do anything special .</li>
    <li> Changing &amp; restoring my hair - as you age it gets duller/lifeless - this is full of vitamins making it lustrous/stronger &amp; more youthful - for all the higher priced shampoos as well as cheaper ones promising all the same benefits - this one actually works!</li>
