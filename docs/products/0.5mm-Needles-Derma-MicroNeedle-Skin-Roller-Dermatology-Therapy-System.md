      <li>Works to great to enhance my face cream results.</li>
      <li>I had used Fraxel laser for 3 years and bought this based on its great reviews.</li>
      <li>My skin looks great.  </li>
      <li>im seeing good results.</li>
      <li>but it does a good job of eliminating wrinkles off my face.</li>
      <li>It is good for the breasts too.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m very pleased with it.  </li>
      <li>I ordered the 0.5mm roller, and I love it!</li>
      <li>Great product for a cheap buy.</li>
      <li>My sister sells another brand for a lot more (r&amp;f&#x27;s) and I think this dies just as good of a job at a fraction of the price.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Many freckles ...</li>
      <li>but i think it is nothing more than a gimmick gadget.</li>
      <li>Interesting concept</li>
      <li>and i am glad i did.</li>
      <li>I thought i would give this a try since there was so many possitive reviews</li>
      <li>I am definitely pleased with the quality of my product.  </li>
      <li>I feel that it will improve the more that I use it.  </li>
      <li>and I just started seeing my skin looking more toned and more supple.</li>
      <li>Ok so I just received this gadget today and was eagerly awaiting my night time beauty regime.  </li>
      <li>I have found the product to be easy to use.</li>
      <li>I was really excited to try this.</li>
      <li>I used it once a month for 4 months, then went back to laser which is much more effective.</li>
      <li>I clean it off with peroxide and a cotton pad.</li>
      <li>I experienced a small amount of redness that was alleviated by trial and error in using the correct amount of pressure.  </li>
      <li>It fills in the top part of breasts where they look flat, fills in with collagen and makes them look more rounded.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 53 with fair dry skin.</li>
      <li>Not doing as much to erase fine lines &amp; wrinkles.</li>
      <li>and so the pain is worth it.</li>
      <li>You can see the difference right away.</li>
      <li>This one is just right for me.  </li>
      <li>I happen to love the feeling, but it might be too much for someone with very sensitive</li>
      <li>Came fast good price tiny good for small spots.</li>
      <li>work good on little lines.</li>
      <li>I also use it with NutriSkin Firming lotion and the results are turning out amazing from what I expected.</li>
      <li>I could really see the results of the needles that smoothed out the surface of my skin and helped in opening the pores.  </li>
      <li>The needles really don&#x27;t hurt.</li>
      <li>Much cheeper than the one from Rodan+Fields.  </li>
      <li>I suggest that you get some skin numbing lotion or cream because that really helps with the pain.</li>
      <li>Too much hype.</li>
      <li>My lotions absorb much quicker after using it, and I think my skin feels smoother already.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I noticed a much tighter effect with the HA serum using it with the roller than without.  </li>
      <li>I bought this roller after I purchased the 1mm roller and the 1mm roller hurt my forehead too much that I would not roll my forehead that much.</li>
      <li>That allowed any creams I was applying to my skin to really go below the surface.  </li>
      <li>Well,yes my skin looked better but the effects were short lasting.</li>
      <li>am 64 and  like my face better than a few years ago , no shallow face, no drooping jawls,&lt;br</li>
      <li>More firm &amp; elastic skin.</li>
      <li>Wow!  </li>
      <li>My skin feels smooth, less oily and no acne.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in my early 50&#x27;s and notice a difference in my appearance and my breasts.</li>
      <li>It causes swelling at first but the swelling goes down and leaves no scarring when I use it repeatedly daily on my face.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have it for over a year but didn&#x27;t use often enough . . I think it slow down my aging appearance .I am 64 and  like my face better than a few years ago , no shallow face, no drooping jawls,&lt;br /&gt;It Hurts. I am using  1.00 mm.</li>
    <li> Came fast good price tiny good for small spots.I could feel it 1st time I used it .Will work good on little lines.</li>
    <li> Interesting concept but i think it is nothing more than a gimmick gadget. i have been doing it religiously for over a month and can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed any difference.</li>
    <li> It causes some slight pain when I use it for my face but it does a good job of eliminating wrinkles off my face. It causes swelling at first but the swelling goes down and leaves no scarring when I use it repeatedly daily on my face. It does cause some discomfort and slight bleeding but no big deal. I clean it off with peroxide and a cotton pad. I have noticed a slight improvement in eliminating lines and wrinkles on my face. It is good for the breasts too. It fills in the top part of breasts where they look flat, fills in with collagen and makes them look more rounded. I&#x27;m in my early 50&#x27;s and notice a difference in my appearance and my breasts. Great product for a cheap buy. It also cleared my acne problem. My skin feels smooth, less oily and no acne.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use it every night before I go to bed, I bought extra for my clients.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try this. I had used Fraxel laser for 3 years and bought this based on its great reviews. Well,yes my skin looked better but the effects were short lasting. After the redness went away, I peeled for a few days, and then my skin glowed for about 2-3 days. I used it once a month for 4 months, then went back to laser which is much more effective.</li>
    <li> It was not very effective ...saw no results ..I would not buy this again or recommend this product  to my friends</li>
    <li> I have noticed a difference after a few weeks of constant use. I also use it with NutriSkin Firming lotion and the results are turning out amazing from what I expected.</li>
    <li> Been using it now for a couple of months.  No issues with the product and I just started seeing my skin looking more toned and more supple.</li>
    <li> Shipping took FOREVER. Product is sturdy enough. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again though.</li>
    <li> Ok so I just received this gadget today and was eagerly awaiting my night time beauty regime.  After I showered and cleansed my face, I used the roller as recommended in the instructions and from others on youtube.  I followed up with my Watts HA serum and a face cream from Avon.  Wow!  I can already see and feel the difference to using this along with the HA serum and cream.  It helps the products get in there and do their thing.  I noticed a much tighter effect with the HA serum using it with the roller than without.  A little puffy and have a slight sunburn look but that was expected.  This is not painless by no means but not intolerable either.  I ordered 2 of these babies after reading about others using it for alopecia, so one for my face and one for my balding head hopefully it will help.  I also have scars from facial piercings that I would like to get rid of or make less noticeable, has anyone used the rollers for this purpose and seen any results?</li>
    <li> After regular use you can see some skin tightning. But it is a bit uncomfortable to the skin. Effect does not last if you stop using it- need to do it at least 3 x a week.</li>
    <li> Too much hype. Damaged my skin. You will need tough skin to use this product.</li>
    <li> i thought it would make tiny holes in my face but it doesnt. you have to use a syrum with it for it to work. im seeing good results.</li>
    <li> This product exceeded my expectations.  I could really see the results of the needles that smoothed out the surface of my skin and helped in opening the pores.  That allowed any creams I was applying to my skin to really go below the surface.  I experienced a small amount of redness that was alleviated by trial and error in using the correct amount of pressure.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it maybe 3 times (every other week) but I&#x27;m very pleased with it.  I think the condition of my skin has improved. I feel that it will improve the more that I use it.  I am definitely pleased with the quality of my product.  I can&#x27;t give it a 5 star rating because I haven&#x27;t used it that long.  I am at this point very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I ordered the 0.5mm roller, and I love it! Works to great to enhance my face cream results.</li>
    <li> I have found the product to be easy to use. The needles really don&#x27;t hurt. They do turn the skin quite red but I use it at night so that isn&#x27;t the problem. I can see improvement in the areas that I am using it on.My pores look smaller and dark spots are fading!</li>
    <li> I bought this roller after I purchased the 1mm roller and the 1mm roller hurt my forehead too much that I would not roll my forehead that much. When I used this 0.5mm roller the pain was not as bad and later I noticed that the skin on my forehead was so much better than before and that my forehead wrinkles had diminished in appearance. I would recommend this roller to someone who is struggling with a larger size needle derma roller who is having a lot of pain when they use it on their forehead.</li>
    <li> This little gadget works miracles. I thought i would give this a try since there was so many possitive reviews and i am glad i did. This roller will hurt like heck but it does wonders for your complexion and so the pain is worth it. I suggest that you get some skin numbing lotion or cream because that really helps with the pain. After I use a serum from Olay. You can see the difference right away.</li>
    <li> I have seen a difference in the texture of my skin and my pores have gotten alot smaller.  I think I am going to order a roller with larger needles.  Maybe 1.0 mm I think it may help with some scars I have,  I am sold on this product.</li>
    <li> I tried 1MM and it was too painful.  This one is just right for me.  I like the price.  Much cheeper than the one from Rodan+Fields.  I use it with Rodan+Fields Anti-Age regiment.  [...]  My skin looks great.  I received this product within a few days of ordering.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 53 with fair dry skin. Many freckles ...I was skeptical. It doesn&#x27;t hurt like I expected it to.  I roll about 1 time a week &amp; can definitely tell a difference. More firm &amp; elastic skin. Not doing as much to erase fine lines &amp; wrinkles. I immediately follow with Hyaluronic Acid Serum so it can penetrate. Works well ...looking forward to seeing what the future holds. Just been using it about 2 months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few days now, and I&#x27;ll update after 4 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s prickly. I happen to love the feeling, but it might be too much for someone with very sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;2. My skin does not turn any redder than it does with a regular scrub, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any swelling.&lt;br /&gt;3. I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day (since I like the feeling) on both my face and some abdominal stretch marks. My lotions absorb much quicker after using it, and I think my skin feels smoother already.&lt;br /&gt;4. My sister sells another brand for a lot more (r&amp;f&#x27;s) and I think this dies just as good of a job at a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> The item is actually on a &amp;#34;slow boat from China.&amp;#34;  No one warned me it would take a month and a half to get here!!!!!</li>
    <li> I used this roller once or twice. I am not really into making my skin irritated</li>
