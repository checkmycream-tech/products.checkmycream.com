    <li> Been using this product for many many years.  It covers nice, is natural looking and goes on smooth.  No need to touch up during the day.  Makes my complexion look years younger.</li>
    <li> I have had skin problems for about the last 8-10 years with breakout and dry spots/scabs, to even extreme oily skin. I have very very sensitive skin that turns red even to the touch or the slightest chemicals on it. I ordered Mary Kay Medium Coverage Foundation (in Beige 300) about a year ago for the first time when a friend of mine was selling it, and fell in love with it! As a person who has tried just about every type of liquid and mineral foundation out there (from MAC to Bare Minerals, from Neutrogena to Loreal and naturales and AVON... you name it, I&#x27;ve tried it) this is my ABSOLUTE favorite. It blends so easily into my skin without turning orange or an off color as the day continues (which I seem to have happen with just about every single foundation I&#x27;ve ever used). I&#x27;m so happy with this product, I don&#x27;t think I will ever try another liquid foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I set my foundation with the lightweight powder. And when I originally bought the 1oz tube was told should last me between 2-3 months. But instead ended up lasting me about 6 or 7! That&#x27;s saying a lot for a girl who used to try and pile on way too much makeup. Now I barely need any. Never would have imagined I would love a brand like Mary Kay.</li>
    <li> wife loves it.. gets it all the time</li>
    <li> Reliable product and delivery.  Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> I placed a foundation from this seller and it was the wrong color not only that but it looked messy like its been used. I sent Item back and when I got the right color it looked the same like if it had been used... I will never order from this person/company again. The only good thing I have to say is that I did get my product and It didnt take long to get here.</li>
    <li> Like the makeup ; I have been using for years.  Good price and efficient on line company!  I recommend it!</li>
    <li> This makeup is excellent. No smells!  Great coverage to hide the red and uneven coloring.  Better than Clinique and that is saying a lot.</li>
    <li> I love Mary Kay products.  I&#x27;ve been using this foundation for years and was glad to be able to find this at amazon and for such a good price.</li>
    <li> Great product. Takes away oily factor of skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this foundation for over 10 years, and it&#x27;s great. It goes on smooth, but I have a tip - cut open the top when it&#x27;s getting low, and you can get another few days of foundation out of it!</li>
    <li> I started using this a couple years ago, I get it all the time ,delivery is always on time and exactly what I orderd</li>
    <li> If you have acne prone skin however this foundation will cover your pores and make you break out, particularly if you are walking around on a humid or hot day or if you do not wash it off after a couple of hours of use.</li>
    <li> I love this foundation! And I have tried many foundations over the years. This is the best to date. I have no intentions of switching...thanks for offering at such a good price!</li>
    <li> This item took too long to arrive. Otherwise the product is what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Awesome foundation! I use it only under my eyes to cover up dark circles. Great coverage. Goes on silky smooth, blends really well. I&#x27;ve tried everything and this is the best I have found.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t was the right color I was waiting for :(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this MK product for many years and I absolutely love it!!  It covers well and gives an all over even tone to my face and neck.  I won&#x27;t use anything else!  Love it!!</li>
    <li> its was what i expected</li>
