      <li>It&#x27;s tear proof and very gentle for our baby&#x27;s skin.  </li>
      <li>Do they let people decide by offering the new formula along with the original?  </li>

      <li>It really is fragrance-free AND no tear.  </li>
      <li>I plan on sticking with this brand to bath my daughter until she tells me she wants otherwise.</li>
      <li>I have used Burts Bees in the past and didn&#x27;t like it, but this is amazing.</li>

      <li>Purple label has yellow letters with \\&quot;NEW, More Sustainable\\&quot; and a flower picture above \\&quot;baby.\\&quot;  </li>
      <li>This is a natural product and it really works well.  </li>
      <li>My only gripe is that it does not have a strong enough for my toddler.</li>
      <li>So we have moved on to a new healthier product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The &#x27;new&#x27; formula has a sulfate in it.  </li>
      <li>New formula.  </li>
      <li>The flower bottle (&#x27;new&#x27; formula) smells like a rotting orange.  </li>
      <li>replaced by &#x27;new&#x27; formula that includes sodium sulfate ...</li>
      <li>One bottle has lasted us 9 months worth of baths so far, and there is still plenty left.  </li>
      <li>Both of my children, since they were born have had very sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Almost all of the ingredients are naturally based and that is a huge plus for me, I don&#x27;t want to start putting harsh chemicals on their gentle and sensitive skin.   </li>
      <li>Keeps her skin and hair soft.</li>
      <li>This used to be&amp;#34; sulfate free&amp;#34; and worked well for my daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>My son is 21 months old now</li>
      <li>Use it on my 4 and 2 year old.  </li>
      <li>Do your children have sensitive skin?  </li>
      <li>I recently ordered Avalon Gentle Tear-Free Shampoo and Body Wash and have been using it on both my 20 month old and my 5 month old.   </li>
      <li>the Avalon Organics website, only the new bottle is displayed with the flower and new formula under the Baby page.  </li>
      <li>A couple of days later, at a checkup, the pediatrician noticed some eczema on my son&#x27;s back and flat out said not to use the washes that are full of fragrances.  </li>
      <li>I do like it for my 5 month old because it is very gentle and the scent is not very strong</li>
      <li>I get out the oil and each calmly waits their turn for a little oil massage..</li>
      <li>Furthermore, there are no harsh ingrdients such as parabens or sulfates.</li>
      <li>Our daughter has sensitive skin and this soap is the only one that works well and doesn&#x27;t give her a rash.</li>
      <li>It is much gentler than Johnson&#x27;s Baby Shampoo (the only other soap we&#x27;ve used while traveling).  </li>
      <li>This wash is NOT tear-free, so be careful when using it on very young children because the soap can sting their eyes if it gets in.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this shampoo and body wash.  Use it on my 4 and 2 year old.  No stinging and lots of good lather.</li>
    <li> Avalon changed their packaging along with the ingredients in this product.  One of the changes includes the addition of the preservatives Sodium Benzoate, Alcohol, and Citric Acid, among others.    According to the Environmental Working Group &lt;[...]&gt;: Sodium Benzoate when combined with Citric Acid \\&quot;can mix together to form the cancer-causing chemical benzene\\&quot;.  Link to article: &lt;[...]&gt;    Look into it yourself - but we are switching to another product which is free of questionable chemicals (see: Earth Mama Angel Baby Shampoo) - and at a lower price per ounce!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff.  I&#x27;ve used it on both of my boys since they were born.  When my husband complained that my infant son didn&#x27;t have the typical Johnson &amp; Johnson baby smell, I did let him use the traditional Johnson and Johnson baby wash stuff a few times.  A couple of days later, at a checkup, the pediatrician noticed some eczema on my son&#x27;s back and flat out said not to use the washes that are full of fragrances.  So, I won the argument with my husband and over two years and another baby later, this is the only thing we&#x27;ll use.  Even my husband is a believer now!!    If my son showers at his cousin&#x27;s, I&#x27;m ready to puke from the overpowering perfume smell.  Avalon Organics does have a very soft clean scent, but it&#x27;s not perfumey in any way. Suds up well, cleans the boys well, rinses easily, doesn&#x27;t sting their eyes.  Also, a little goes a long way.  I probably use about 1 bottle a month for 2 boys getting daily baths.  Love it!</li>
    <li> My son is 21 months old now and this is the only body wash we use. I have tried other organic and non-organic options, but this is by far the best!  It is very concentrated, so one bottle lasts a while!</li>
    <li> I love the because it&#x27;s soft and gentle. Doesn&#x27;t bother kids eyes. We don&#x27;t use anything else!&lt;br /&gt;We have bottle in each of our bathrooms and I plan on only buying this while my kids are little. No smells either</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very careful which products I&#x27;ll use on my baby.  I feel very confident using Avalon.  This is a natural product and it really works well.  A little goes a long way, too.  We use it in the bath as soap and shampoo.  I also squirt a small drop in some water to use when changing diapers using cloth wipes.  Really gets him clean and feels so much better than the chemicals on commercial diaper wipes.</li>
    <li> This wash is NOT tear-free, so be careful when using it on very young children because the soap can sting their eyes if it gets in.</li>
    <li> UPDATED REVIEW 9-24-2013&lt;br /&gt;I used to love this stuff.  I used it for years but then about a year or so ago the recipe changed &amp; it is no longer preservative free :(. Unfortunately I discovered this after I ordered a box of them from Amazon.  Very disappointed in the company trying to sneak his one by:(  Fortunately I have discovered a better product at Costco -- Honest Kids body wash I think. It gets a 2 (good score) on EWGs Skin Deep database. So we have moved on to a new healthier product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW 2010&lt;br /&gt;This is the main baby wash I have used for my two children now 5 and 8.  I still use it to wash their faces and hair. It&#x27;s very gentle with a pleasant mild scent.  I also have used it to clean my eye makeup.  My opthamalogist recommended no-tears baby wash when I had minor eye infection and it works great!</li>
    <li> I bought this brand after my son had an allergic reaction (burns and rashes all over) to coppertone sunblock. I used their AD&amp;E ointment which helped with the rash (got better in 1-2 days) but the bodywash is great too! It makes a good bit of bubbles and the smell is so refreshing. I actually started using it as my bodywash!</li>
    <li> It really is fragrance-free AND no tear.  It&#x27;s mild, easy to rinse, and leaves hair soft and shiny.  Very hard to find even in my major suburban area.  Whole Foods used to carry it but has made inexplicable stock cut-backs.</li>
    <li> Our favorite soap, have been using it since our son was an infant. (2 years)</li>
    <li> Do your children have sensitive skin?  Both of my children, since they were born have had very sensitive skin. The popular name brands, even their sensitive skin formulas caused large red blotches within seconds of it touching their skin, leaving them dry and itchy.    Even though it costs more, it is so very worth it for the health and comfort of my children.  The first time I used it I knew I had a winner as absultely no rash or blotches resulted.  (also, the baby oil is wonderful...here is a hint for parents, when my kids are getting a little too wound up or moody I get out the oil and each calmly waits their turn for a little oil massage..and when it&#x27;s over they are still calm and quieter)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve use this product to bath my daughter since she was first born.  It is much gentler than Johnson&#x27;s Baby Shampoo (the only other soap we&#x27;ve used while traveling).  This product also has a pleasant, gentle smell.  One bottle has lasted us 9 months worth of baths so far, and there is still plenty left.  I plan on sticking with this brand to bath my daughter until she tells me she wants otherwise.</li>
    <li> After trying several others, we have used this baby wash for our daughter for over two years now.  Easy on the skin, the eyes, and smells nice.   I find that it lathers well and one bottle will last a couple months, at least.</li>
    <li> New formula.  Purple label has yellow letters with \\&quot;NEW, More Sustainable\\&quot; and a flower picture above \\&quot;baby.\\&quot;  The good one has a picture of an orange duck with \\&quot;sulfate-free\\&quot; on the label.  The &#x27;new&#x27; formula has a sulfate in it.  If you&#x27;re going to try and read the ingredients on the label, get out a magnifier.  It must be in the smallest print size allowed by law.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here we go:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Aqua (Water), Sodium Coco-Sulfate, Decyl Glucoside, Sodium Chloride, Glycerin, Lauryl Lactyl Lactate, Arnica Montana Flower Extract, Avena Sativa (Oat) Bran, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Camellia Sinesis Leaf Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Flower Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis Helianthus Annus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Beta-Glucan, Citric Acid, Sodium Sulfate, Alcohol, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Limonene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottle promotes 70% organic ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Product is preserved with Sodium Benzoate.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So ... orange duck bottle promoting &#x27;sulfate-free&#x27; on label ... replaced by &#x27;new&#x27; formula that includes sodium sulfate ... among other things like alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The organge duck formula smells like an orange and the smell rapidly goes away.  Can shower in it and not smell like an orange afterwards (goes away rapidly).  The flower bottle (&#x27;new&#x27; formula) smells like a rotting orange.  The smell lasts on the body and I had to use other soap to wash off the unpleasant odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The orange duck has no mention of HAIN Celestial Group.  The &#x27;new&#x27; formula bottle has \\&quot;Manufactured for Distribution By: (c) 2011 The HAIN CELESTIAL GROUP, INC.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the Avalon Organics website, only the new bottle is displayed with the flower and new formula under the Baby page.  I get the impression the orange duck formula is no more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Find something that works and works well ... then they change it.  Do they let people decide by offering the new formula along with the original?  Apparently not.</li>
    <li> I recently ordered Avalon Gentle Tear-Free Shampoo and Body Wash and have been using it on both my 20 month old and my 5 month old.   IMO it is a great wash for a baby that is not yet too mobile because it does not have a very strong smell. Therefore, those babies and toddlers that are running around and tend to get a bit dirtiier and sweatier need something with a stronger scent. I do like it for my 5 month old because it is very gentle and the scent is not very strong which is good for an infant or baby.   Furthermore, there are no harsh ingrdients such as parabens or sulfates. Almost all of the ingredients are naturally based and that is a huge plus for me, I don&#x27;t want to start putting harsh chemicals on their gentle and sensitive skin.   My only gripe is that it does not have a strong enough for my toddler.</li>
    <li> Pleasant smell and gentle on sensitive skin. My son was allergic to just about everything until we tried this. It smells good, doesn&#x27;t burn his eyess, and most of all it doesn&#x27;t break out his delicate skin.</li>
    <li> I have used this before and was very happy to see it on Prime here! LOVE THIS! I have used Burts Bees in the past and didn&#x27;t like it, but this is amazing. Keeps her skin and hair soft. (And she has a LOT of hair!) And smells great! Shipping was super fast!</li>
    <li> We love this shampoo.  It&#x27;s tear proof and very gentle for our baby&#x27;s skin.  It&#x27;s scent-free which decreases the chances of irritations on baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
    <li> This used to be&amp;#34; sulfate free&amp;#34; and worked well for my daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin.  Now, I will have to find another product to take its place.</li>
    <li> This product is Sweet on the baby and sweet on mama. I do not know if I need to say any more!</li>
    <li> I have used this wash for my son&#x27;s body and hair since he was a baby. He has pretty sensitive skin, and has no problem with this wash. Not a big deal if it gets in his eyes. Easy to rinse. Pleasant (not overwhelming) smell.</li>
    <li> Our daughter has sensitive skin and this soap is the only one that works well and doesn&#x27;t give her a rash.</li>
    <li> This product is very very good and washing clearly,I will buy  this product more next time.I will suggest other people.</li>
