      <li>Easy to apply.</li>
      <li>So easy to use and stays on for me all day...........</li>
      <li>I liked this product, but first, it comes off easily</li>
      <li>My dream brown product!&lt;br /&gt;I would say to those of you who might be uncertain which color to choose, I have fairly dark brows, but am light otherwise, and I went with the light-medium and it matches perfectly, so do take that into consideration.</li>
      <li>will just warn you, it is not being advertised accurately.</li>
      <li>I have dirty-blonde hair and light brown eyebrows</li>
      <li>and I got the light color</li>
      <li>I bought iot because I am so light</li>
      <li>I was worried that I ordered too light of a color.  </li>
      <li>wish there were a lighter color than light medium.</li>
      <li>this gel is good at first.but than i felt like the top got kinda chunky and gross..</li>
      <li>Quick &amp; easy.</li>
      <li>I especially liked the small attached brush.</li>
      <li>Since you are able to build the color to your liking, the shades are very versatile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It gives a nice, soft look, too, which I like.</li>
      <li>I got this to try and have a quick option for every day.</li>
      <li>Similar products have a bigger brush - this one is the perfect size for brows.</li>
      <li>This &amp;#34;Gimme Brow&amp;#34; makes my brows look the most normal of anything I&#x27;ve purchased.  </li>
      <li>.they are very important to complete your look!</li>
      <li>- a natural look is very important to me.</li>
      <li>It brings the clumpiness of mascara to your brows, but if you can work through that, it does look much more natural than pencil.</li>
      <li>but, it&#x27;s worth your time and money.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a way to fill in your brows and give them great shape while still looking natural and not overdone then definitely give this product a chance.</li>
      <li>My brows look more natural than they ever have.  </li>
      <li>The small brush is very good to comb stray eyebrows, it holds well and it lasts a whole day (if you do not touch it).  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m ordering it from amazon right now.</li>
      <li>I have blonde hair and dark blonde/brown eyebrows and this color works perfectly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried: Anastasia, Benefit&#x27;s Brow Zings, numerous pencils, and Stila&#x27;s marker and this is hands down the best one.  </li>
      <li>The most important feature is that it actually stays, unlike many products that initially work but disappear before you get home.</li>
      <li>So easy to use and looks natural</li>
      <li>It is pretty easy to apply and looks natural.</li>
      <li>Only one that ever worked for me and I have tried many.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Really like this stuff. It works! I like full, lush brows without looking harsh. This is an excellent product!</li>
    <li> I love this product....it fills in gaps and keeps my crazy brows in place.</li>
    <li> Bought for my Mom. She loves it</li>
    <li> I was worried that I ordered too light of a color.  I have med. colored brows and was worried about the light/medium.  I love it!  The color was perfect.  It goes on darker than what is pictured.  My brows look more natural than they ever have.  I have always used a brow pencil but have put it away for good.  Absolutely love this product and would recommend it for anyone. Just wished it was a little less expensive.</li>
    <li> I was so disappointed. I was already using something similar from Revlon which only cost 8 dollars. It does about the same thing. It works ok but not any better than what I already had.,</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I don&#x27;t use it everyday as I have a system for building my brows and I use this one on days I need a little extra color for a dramatic brow.  Just remember to use short strokes and then you can let it dry a second and brush through with a brow brush to make sure there&#x27;s no extra product and that it&#x27;s distributed correctly.</li>
    <li> the product arrived dry</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have used for eyebrows.  Really works well.</li>
    <li> Blonde eyelashes now look bolder without looking crazy weird with a dark pencil.  It&#x27;s easy to apply.  Doesn&#x27;t rub off or smear.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!  Fills in bare spots and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> I have tried many brow products but this is a winner for me.  It gives me the natural look I have been looking for</li>
    <li> Love this product for filling in brows without looking like they are drawn on.  It&#x27;s a little pricey but lasts a long time and is worth it.</li>
    <li> My first try at this left me still in despair.  I ahev a health condition that makes my hair thin and fall out.  My eyebrows have been a serious issue for me for years.  First go at this and I didn&#x27;t think it worked at all, but I let it dry for 20 minutes, and then reapplyed.  If you have very sparse areas like me, letting it dry in between a few applications does wonders.</li>
    <li> Great for shaping eyebrows and for filling in those few that don&#x27;t/haven&#x27;t grown back. Not noticeable, but I do recommend a lighter color than your hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product by Benefit and great pricing from this website!</li>
    <li> Lightly brush on to fill in where you are losing hair in your eyebrow area (never thought that would happen!) and no one! I mean no one! ever knows the difference!</li>
    <li> So easy to use and stays on for me all day...........</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It looks more natural than most brow pencils and isn&#x27;t too dark for my blondish brows. It is a lquid like a mascara, but for your brows. The tip of the brush is small enough to accurately apply it. I recommend combing your brow hairs upwards and outwards apply the liquid and then comb your brow into place. It&#x27;s good if you have some sparser areas in your brow.</li>
    <li> Easiest application for my eyebrows I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with this product. I have been trying to grow out my eyebrows for a year and half with little success, the hairs grow in patchy and don&#x27;t look full. I have blonde hair and dark blonde/brown eyebrows and this color works perfectly. I was never a fan of shading my eyebrows with a pencil as it usually looks fake. When applied, this prouct looks natural, my eyebrows look thick and shapely. I use it every day and my eyebrows have never looked better!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite beauty product. I was looking for a product that would provide definition to my brows and also a way to keep them in place during a long work day or night out. This brow color/gel allows you to build color and shape your brows all at the same time. I have dirty-blonde hair and light brown eyebrows so I was a little nervous about getting the correct color - a natural look is very important to me. I ended up going with the light/medium color and it blends in perfectly and fills out my brows just the right amount. Since you are able to build the color to your liking, the shades are very versatile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gime Brow is also long lasting - even through a long workday and intense workout my brows looked great at the end of the night. If you are looking for a way to fill in your brows and give them great shape while still looking natural and not overdone then definitely give this product a chance.</li>
    <li> Color didn&#x27;t match, it looks totally fake and doesn&#x27;t roll on well, despite following the instructions.  Dear Benefit, human hair comes in a range of colors.</li>
    <li> The small brush is very good to comb stray eyebrows, it holds well and it lasts a whole day (if you do not touch it).  It is a small size.  The light/medium color was good for me - I have dirty blonde hair and darker eyebrows.</li>
    <li> The brush holds clumps of concentrated product making it impossible to get a nice, even finish.</li>
    <li> My eyebrows start in too far from the inner edge (nearest the nose) and they are thin. I have tried everything out there for years to make natural looking eyebrows. Nothing worked. This does! Make little strokes where you want eyebrows and it looks just like eyebrows. The most important feature is that it actually stays, unlike many products that initially work but disappear before you get home. I could not be more pleased with this wonderful product.</li>
    <li> So I over plucked in high school and have always had brows that are full at the beginning of the brow but thin out at the arch. I have been penciling and powdering in for YEARS. I got this to try and have a quick option for every day. This does not have fibers in it that will create brows where there are none. It is your basic color depositing eyebrow gel. It can make brows hard so wipe of excess before applying. You can use the tip of the brush and apply the product onto the skin to fill in like you would with a pencil but this is no miracle cure. I finally looked into getting eyebrow tattooing and I did it! They can now tattoo what looks like hairs on your brows and it seriously looks like real hair. So if you need a permanent solution look into it and stop looking for a miracle product.</li>
    <li> I really like this brow item. It covers my gray and looks very natural.</li>
    <li> This is the best brow product I have ever used! It really helps fill in my eyebrows and it stays for the whole day. it also works well with other brow products if you really want to step up your brow game!</li>
    <li> I have no eyebrows since turning 60. This brush is amazing and lifts up to color the brow hairs I do have.. I have truly used products from every name brand cosmetic line.. Smashbox, Malley, Tarte, Urban decay, Anastasia,Laura Geller, Clinque, and more. I ordered one for my sister as well and she agrees with me.. The BEST.</li>
    <li> Very nice eye brow product for someone with thin blows. Really enhances the brow and fills in bare spots.I love it. Have bought it twice already.</li>
    <li> LOVE THE LOOK AND EASE OF USE.  IT IS A LITTLE TOO LIGHT FOR ME AND THE DARK IS A LITTLE TOO DARK. HOPE THEY CREATE A NEW COLOR SOON</li>
    <li> This item was dried out. I don&#x27;t know if the item was old or if that is the way it is.</li>
    <li> This product builds brows and smells good, too. I recommend it and the color as well for the best effect with thinning light colored brows.</li>
    <li> This is the greatest product I&#x27;ve ever tried for thinning brows.  It gives a nice, soft look, too, which I like.</li>
    <li> They say this acts as little hairs. NOT. Its just like you wrote on your lashes with a marker. I bought iot because I am so light and my eyebrows are blonde and almost invisible in spots. It did not work, but the seller was super nice and refunded my money.&lt;br /&gt;I  will just warn you, it is not being advertised accurately.</li>
    <li> My daughter had this brow brush on her wishlist and when her birthday came around I purchased it for her. She told me she loves this particular brand and type of eye brow cosmetic. She finds it works better than pencil.</li>
    <li> I lost part of my eyebrow due to radiation, and this product looks so natural, catches the small hairs that are there and fills in the rest. Love it!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in this product. I have very sparse brows and was hoping Gimme Brows would be the answer. Unfortunately this did not meet my expectations.</li>
    <li> perfect thing!! Start in the middle and work back before going to the front. (Expert use mode :-)&lt;br /&gt;Recommended by Allure magazine</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  Quick &amp; easy.</li>
    <li> It worked fine except too dark for my light hair. wish there were a lighter color than light medium. Did wathit said it would. Barbara</li>
    <li> I really like this brow enhancer as it makes my brows really stand out but not too much.  My hair is graying and so is my eyebrows so this product is great for me!  I wish the tube was larger because I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ll run out of the tube fast.</li>
    <li> I bought this in store a few months ago and I&#x27;m ordering it from amazon right now. I have red hair and my eye brows are so light you can barely see them. I could never find something to make my eyebrows darker without turning them brown. Although this is brown, it turns my eyebrows just a darker red and the perfect shade!! I&#x27;m so happy I found this.</li>
    <li> I have brows again! Had stitches in eyebrow on both sides, they never grew back, not good with pencil. These are perfect!</li>
    <li> Good product. You just have to be careful not to apply too much if you have lighter coloring. I typically scrape off a lot of the product before applying.</li>
    <li> Love this, on my second bottle.</li>
    <li> This product did all it claimed it would do. I especially liked the small attached brush. It was very easy to use. I have used other similar products and powders. I found Gimme Brow to be the best.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Since going through Chemo, my eyebrows are very light and thin.  Now I feel &#x27;normal&#x27;.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Armani Brow pencil. Read the rave reviews about this product,but honestly there is little difference and the price is astronomical. Does the same job and longevity is comparable.</li>
    <li> lost it on a trip so only after 2 uses I wasn&#x27;t that impressed anyway</li>
    <li> This is a life changer. I&#x27;ve tried: Anastasia, Benefit&#x27;s Brow Zings, numerous pencils, and Stila&#x27;s marker and this is hands down the best one.  It&#x27;s so easy to apply, literally 1-2 strokes across your eyebrows and you&#x27;re set! It makes it look like you spent time grooming and perfecting them when it took you probably 10 seconds. Color is great, I&#x27;m a natural dark blonde and have highlights and I got the light color and it looks very natural. Would recommend to anyone that wants to fill in their brows but doesn&#x27;t want to take 10 minutes doing so!</li>
    <li> great to cover up gray a little hard for touch up spots. but great product stay on all day nice</li>
    <li> I used to use Bare Minerals brow powder and did not like the length of time and level of effort it to took apply. This is so quick and easy to use and the best part is how natural your brows look afterwards. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> My brows look good now at long last I&#x27;ve found the correct brow corrector</li>
    <li> Difficult to use.  Brush to long and medium color too light.  I expected much more from a expensive Benefit product.</li>
    <li> Love the product AND the price!</li>
    <li> sometimes it globs when I am not being careful, but overall it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> This is great. The only other blonde brow gel I&#x27;ve used is Bobbi Browns-- the Benefit one not only lasts longer, but has better pigment and a WAY BETTER brush to more precisely apply it.</li>
    <li> Love this brow gel.. I have blond hair and this goes on easy and natural looking, but might want to brush out and any heavy spots with a brow brush.  If you have a Ulta store close by you can get it a lot cheaper there.</li>
    <li> Great product and delivery&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gimme Brow works so well my eyebrows have gotten sparse and gray&lt;br /&gt;This product covers the gray and also makes the brow seem fuller.</li>
    <li> This is the best brow enhancer.  I love it and would purchase again</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It works just exactly the way that I wanted it to do.  My eyebrows are sparse, and contain grey and brown hairs.  This colors them in such a way that they look much more natural than any other product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> as I have gotten older the wings of my brows have disappeared.  This fills it back in for me.  I had considered getting tatoo&#x27;s but now I don&#x27;t need to</li>
    <li> I like eye brows .they are very important to complete your look! this gel is good at first.but than i felt like the top got kinda chunky and gross..wouldn&#x27;t rebuy this idem.also very over priced ! You can buy. elf brow kit for 2bucks .just as good and not chunky and gross after just a few applications..</li>
    <li> Similar products have a bigger brush - this one is the perfect size for brows. Its a little bit too light for me as a dark blonde/light brunette but great product.</li>
    <li> Love it! Does a great job of filling in brows without looking fake.</li>
    <li> hits the necessary notes in style. It does actually change color to match my brows, which is something that has never really worked for me before. It does fill in sparse areas well, but without resulting in looking like I&#x27;m wearing cardboard eyebrows. It controls wayward hairs and gives a hairlike finish, just a tiny bit of glow, as opposed to the dull and fake look of powders. In addition the container is small and very portable. The product hasn&#x27;t worn off in any of the time I&#x27;ve used it, and doesn&#x27;t flake. My dream brown product!&lt;br /&gt;I would say to those of you who might be uncertain which color to choose, I have fairly dark brows, but am light otherwise, and I went with the light-medium and it matches perfectly, so do take that into consideration. I am certain that the dark would be far too dark on me</li>
    <li> I have thin brows and this helps them look fuller. It is pretty easy to apply and looks natural. Definitely would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Had this all over my eyebrows, clumps and goopy.  Finally tried it after I wiped the applicator with a tissue. Still not the best, but better than before. Must be for those with perfect brows.</li>
    <li> Just what I need; have re-ordered, and appreciate small size for make-up bag</li>
    <li> I liked this product, but first, it comes off easily - actually wears off if I go to the gym and perspire at all, and it does not last long in the container, either!  Within several weeks it got &#x27;cakey&#x27;, and did not last a month.  It is way too expensive to not live up to the hype I have read about it.  Buyer, beware.  (However, have to say it does make my brows look completely natural... until it wears off during the day,.....)</li>
    <li> Does as advertised. It is darker than you might think from the color of the tube. Also, dries very quickly, so must keep refreshing - don&#x27;t know how that will effect it&#x27;s life.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  So easy to use and looks natural</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Buildable. Perfect color. Idk what I would do without it now. I wish it came with more though.</li>
    <li> All this is, is expensive mascara. Would not buy it again. Haven&#x27;t even used this one. Mascara is by far cheaper and will do the same thing.</li>
    <li> This basically a mascara sold as brow color.  I think an inexpensive mascara would do the same job..  I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> Whoa..WOW.  This product lives up to my high expectations.  I had been using mascara to do my brows which didn&#x27;t give me the look I wanted. The outer part of my brows have thinned out and this product has a fabulous little brush.  It allowed me to fill out the \\&quot;skimpy\\&quot; areas with ease and...while having a natural look. Yes...it&#x27;s more expensive but, it&#x27;s worth your time and money. Bravo...great product :)</li>
    <li> This is a WONDERFUL PRODUCT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Only one that ever worked for me and I have tried many. thank you</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry I bought this.  The brush allows for no delicacy of application and it produces bushy eyebrows worthy of an eighty-year old senator.</li>
    <li> This &amp;#34;Gimme Brow&amp;#34; makes my brows look the most normal of anything I&#x27;ve purchased.  I&#x27;ll be back for another....couldn&#x27;t it be CHEAPER?</li>
    <li> I did not believe their was a product made that could fill in my skimpy eyebrows and look so natural.  Boy!!  Was I wrong!!  This product works magically.</li>
    <li> Great for aging eyebrows! Does exactly as it promises.  Looks so natural. Easy to apply.</li>
    <li> This is just perfect Your eybrows look fuller and it looks very natural</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay I don&#x27;t really see a use for it... I have brow powder and pencil. I think this is an overkill</li>
    <li> This product worked great!</li>
    <li> totally inadequate. not using.</li>
    <li> It brings the clumpiness of mascara to your brows, but if you can work through that, it does look much more natural than pencil.</li>
