    <li> Fresh scent. Great price. My gf loves it!</li>
    <li> This was not the same product I purchased from a VS store.  The bottle and cap are different; the smell is slightly different (weaker); and, the insignia on the bottle is a cheap imitation (removable) of the real VS insignia (non-removable).  Overpriced knock-off.</li>
    <li> I recently purchase a full size bottle of this body spray at the Victoria&#x27;s Secret semi annual sale. I was originally attracted to it because it was really cheap. I believe it was 50% off so $12.50 for the large size bottle. I will be honest I didn&#x27;t buy it the first day I saw it. But I did spray the scent on my clothing. For the rest of the day that was all I could smell. I had to go back and buy it. I lucked out because by the time it went it was 75% off so I paid like $6. I love the scent it is very feminine. I like the original Bombshell a tad bit better but it is a very close second. It is a subtle but sexy. I recommend as a light clean body spray.</li>
