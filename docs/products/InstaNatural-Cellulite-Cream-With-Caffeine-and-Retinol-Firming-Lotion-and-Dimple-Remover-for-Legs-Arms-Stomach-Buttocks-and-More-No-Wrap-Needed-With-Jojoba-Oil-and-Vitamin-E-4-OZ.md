<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This cream is great for anyone wanting to get rid of celluite</li>
    <li> This one actually does seem to be helping.  It has a lite scent that is hard to describe, it smells good.  The color is a light brown but the color doesn&#x27;t affect your skin.  It is very soft and rubs in nicely.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue at all.  I have been using it one to two times per day for over a week and my skin is definitely softer.  It seems to be firming my skin some but not enough to be jumping for.  I do feel that I need to use it longer and I wonder how long the effects will last.  It is soothing to put on area&#x27;s that you have shaved.  It has some great ingredients: caffeine, coco butter.  It is hard to read the label with the color changes. It comes plastic sealed so that you have no leakage issues or safety concerns.</li>
    <li> Very thick. Leaves your thighs looking firmed and smooth. Think it works, after using it almost 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Oh stretch mark how you have lightened up since I&#x27;ve used this produced.  I have a few on my belly that I&#x27;ve been trying to minimize and so far nothing has really helped me.  I had a darker one on my belly that now has lightened up and is starting to look better.  I cannot wait to see what will happen once I use all of it :)  I will be making this part of my daily routine.</li>
    <li> Mehhh not too much of anything yet. Its been 2 weeks of twice a day applications....no difference yet</li>
    <li> I definitely likedthis cream. I&#x27;m not convinced that it really helped with the cellulite but my skin does somehow appear better. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just because my skin was getting moisturized twice a day everyday or if it really is the cream. I&#x27;m not too crazy about the smell but I just waited for it to dry and applied my fav bath and body works lotion and it wasn&#x27;t a problem.</li>
    <li> Still using but the texture and smell is great!!!</li>
    <li> Smell is fine, easy to rub in. I am using it daily and am sure that the massaging action is also great for it. I have high hopes! love the ingredients. have used others that are basically all chemicals.</li>
    <li> Wow! Since weight loss i am having sagging  skinbon thighs. My cupboard  isbfilled with every cream you can imagine. After 3 days starting to see improvement.bmy skin not only smells good but super soft and super hydrated. Not greasy.i will give further details as time goes on.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Uses a little over two weeks, the skin like silk, and as the baby&#x27;s skin !! The only problem - an unpleasant smell. I apply the cream once a day at bedtime and in the morning no smell from skin, that excellent. Just an amazing feeling on the skin!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for almost 3 weeks. It says to use twice a day which I try to do but usually end up only using it once. This stuff DOES WORK!!!! My husband travels a lot and upon coming home he could tell a difference. I will continue to buy this product. Only con I have is the smell it&#x27;s not to pleasant.</li>
    <li> I havn&#x27;t used the cellulite cream long enough yet to see a drastic change in my cellulite areas but I do notice that the area where I applied the cream is lighter in color and the cellulite looks less noticeable than when I didn&#x27;t use the cream. The scent of the InstaNatural Cellulite Cream is mostly of cocoa butter and shea butter but it does contain a lot of other natural oils. I didn&#x27;t have any allergic reaction or skin irritations after using this cream and it was moisturizing. I will continue to use it and hope that everything will be gone within a month. :)</li>
    <li> Great product! Love it and would recommend! Helps legs look sexy!!!</li>
    <li> Really great cream. Absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t have an over powering smell. The key to seeing results is to use twice a day consistently!! I&#x27;ve applied this to the backs of my thighs and my dimples aren&#x27;t as deep and my skin doesn&#x27;t seem as lumpy. I&#x27;m only about half way through the bottle so I&#x27;m hopeful with continued use I&#x27;ll get the full results I want. At this price, its absolutely worth it in my opinion!</li>
    <li> Ahh Cellulite, how I dislike you with a passion! In the movies you see these gorgeous legs and then there are mine. Products like this one from InstaNaturals help me with the little struggles I have. I got this for review and have been using it for about three and a half weeks and so far so good. I have noticed firmness in my thighs and a smoothness on the front and sides. This isn&#x27;t a miracle cream but if you apply it as directed, I feel it helps and seriously..every little bit helps :)</li>
    <li> It tightens your skin for sure. I could visibly see firmness improvement which is the only reason I am still using it, but it isn&#x27;t firming up your fat. Lol your cellulite ain&#x27;t going anywhere with this, but I do use it nightly because I&#x27;m losing weight and I truly feel this will help keep it more tight and firm! It stinks though. Omg it smells like weird coffee? I hate the fragrance which is why I only gave it 3 stars.</li>
    <li> I will start by saying that this is the first Cellulite cream I have tried and I have to admit I was pretty skeptical when I received it to review. I consider myself on the tall side with long legs and I have a large midsection where I have had trouble losing the baby weight. (Of course, having 5 kids has had nothing to do with that) Hehehe. But, I have my problem areas when it comes to Cellulite and that is my upper leg and thigh regions and my arms, butt and stomach area. Gosh when I say it out loud I should just say Full Body Cellulite issues. (smile).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the Cellulite Cream now for almost a week and the consistency of the cream is really creamy, I use it 2X a day like the bottle recommends. The cream comes in a pump that is really easy to use. It also has a little stopper so there are no accidents and the floral scent is very pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using daily I can see that my skin on the back on legs is firmer and I do see less dimpling of my skin. The Cream leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. My husband has even complimented me and has asked if I have used a different lotion before bed, he says it smells very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say I was really amazed and I can&#x27;t wait to keep using it to see how much more my skin will tighten and smooth in my problem areas.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, great price, fast shipping, great seller!</li>
    <li> My wife has dealt with cellulite in her belly since the birth of our second child. She only weighs 114 pounds and all the extra pounds are right in the middle. She was able to try this cream for free and is looking forward to how it works getting rid of the cellulite. She has tried it for a two days and has already noticed it working. She will continue to use it, expecting and hoping for the promised results. If it continues to work this well, the results will be perfect. The best part of this is the product is made of natural ingredients that will not hurt her. She looks forward to more good results and a younger youthful look. What she knows now is the product makes her skin feel great. We have used many InstaNatural products and they are all made of quality natural ingredients that don&#x27;t irritate your skin.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I haven&#x27;t been using it long, but I love the way it feels on my skin, and I am starting to see a difference on my thighs!</li>
    <li> It will take sometime, but looks promising!</li>
    <li> Awesome product, just started using it and it doesn&#x27;t leave you all greasy which is nice. Cant wait to see the results and update my review!!!!</li>
    <li> Caffeine stat! My skin instantly feels woken up! I’ve recently discovered this amazing brand, InstaNatural! I bought the line, so I am going to dissect each product one by one. When looking for a new skin care routine, one of the things I was concerned about, was making sure that I could return the product if I wasn’t happy with it. InstaNatural gives you a 100% lifetime guarantee that you will LOVE their products! This brand confidence, made me want to take a chance on them and I am so glad I did! I have been using these products for a week now and I can already see a difference in my skin!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be honest I don&#x27;t have a lot of cellulite to get rid of in the first place, but I do have the horrible bumps on the upper thighs.  This stuff works wonders.  It smooths those ugly dimples &amp; leaves a perfectly smoothed skin.</li>
    <li> Glide on smooth the smell is strong I like how it has coffee in it</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth and absorbs nicely.</li>
    <li> I received this cream free for review.  It came in a generous size pump (5 fl.oz).  When I first went to use the cream, it was very hard to pump initially until it reach the surface. It is very thick and lightly tan in color.  It smells exactly like cocoa butter.  I have used other cocoa butter products before and this one seemed to be very similar in appearance and scent.  The scent is definitely there, so you must like the cocoa butter smell.  It sort of reminded me of being at the beach- not a bad thing!  It is very thick, as I mentioned, and a little goes a very long way.  I used it on my mid section and legs and my skin does seem smoother and firmer.  A plus is that it is made of all natural ingredients so you can feel good about what you are using on your body.  This cream is definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> I reviewed this Cellulite cream recently to get rid of my pesky cellulite. The package arrived on time and in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;InstaNatural’s Cellulite Cream contains caffeine, retinol, cocoa butter, shea butter, vitamin C, and vitamin B5 to help tone, tighten, nourish, repair and restore skin. This reduces the appearance of dimples and cellulite over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream is a powerful solution for a smoother, firmer, more supple appearance. The superior blend of ingredients will help you achieve long-lasting results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two weeks of using this cream, I noticed a major difference in the way my skin felt and looked. I was very pleased and I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I use this along with my derma roller to make sure the cream is really getting into my skin. So far I&#x27;ve noticed my stretch marks and cellulite are not as visible. I use it very sparingly to stretch it out. It doesn&#x27;t smell very good either.</li>
    <li> So , I&#x27;v had a dent in my back thigh for years.  I&#x27;v read about how saving coffee grounds and applying it to cellulite helped to temporarily hide cellulite. I ordered this product because I LOOOOOVE the company and the customer service so when the opportunity to try this out because available I didn&#x27;t hesitate.  I&#x27;v used this three times, and it smells a lot like coffee which is why I think this will work, I&#x27;v applied it and have felt a difference in moisture.  I&#x27;ll take a picture next month to see if this worked.  (please don&#x27;t judge) .&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased feedback.</li>
    <li> This is a very rich, thick, and highly moisturizing cream that really helps diminishing cellulite, for a flawless skin texture. First of all, the cream has a pump, which allows for complete use of the product without wastes nor contamination, maintaining the properties of the product until the last mL. It has great ingredients such as caffeine and retinol, which stimulates the skin cells to regenerate and tighten. I definitely feel a tighter skin, yet adequately hydrated. The caffeine itself stimulates the blood circulation within the area, improving tone and skin appearance. The cream smells great, and it is a good size, which lasts about 1-2 months depending on how often and how much of the product do you apply. I use it mostly on my legs, to keep my skin free from cellulite, and remain ready for the summer. The continuous use brings long lasting results. A great affordable solution to substitute or prevent expensive treatments at clinic. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The InstaNatural Premium Enrichment Cellulite Cream comes in quite a large bottle (150ml) with a pump action dispenser.  The dispenser is clear, which really helps control the amount of cream you are using.  It smells like cocoa butter mixed with coffee and is actually quite pleasant even though I don’t like coffee!  It is easy to apply and I have found that it rubs into your skin quite quickly.  I waited around 5 minutes for the cream to soak in before I got dressed.  I don’t think I have been using it long enough yet for it to have any effect on any cellulite BUT my skin does now feel very soft and smooth.  Review powered by Brandbacker!</li>
    <li> I have cellulite in the back of my legs it isn&#x27;t too bad but the cellulite is definitely noticeable. I have noticed that creams with retinol usually work best and that&#x27;s why I wanted to try this cream. I have been using this cream for some weeks now and I have noticed a difference it took about 2 weeks for me to actually notice a slight difference. This cream does have a sorta mocha scent to it and a small amount hoes a long way so after almost 3 weeks of applying it once a day I still have more than half left it&#x27;s kinda of thick but goes on smoothly and dries very fast. I will continue to use this cream because it&#x27;s definitely helping me with my cellulite.</li>
    <li> New nightly ritual, love this, and I needed the help especially with vacation coming.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had this for too long but so far I&#x27;m loving the results</li>
    <li> So, after purchasing, I received an email with instructions regarding how to use the product and they were very upfront that it could take up to 2 months to see results. Just received the product yesterday. I have some cellulite around my buttocks and upper thigh area. Not too bad, but definitely some dimples I don&#x27;t want. I took a shower and used the product last night. The smell of it is something to get used to. Not bad, but not the best smelling thing in the world, lol. It&#x27;s very smooth (and a tad greasy, but not in a gross way) and left my skin feeling very soft. Went to bed and (knowing not to expect any sudden changes) saw a dramatic reduction in dimpling in the morning! Maybe because I haven&#x27;t really had cellulite until very recently, but I was very happy and surprised at how my skin looked and felt this morning. Even if it didn&#x27;t help with cellulite (which it obviously did), I would use it for the simple fact of how awesome it makes my skin feel. Applied some more this morning...we&#x27;ll see how it goes from here!</li>
    <li> WORKS, slowly but surely if you apply it once a day you will most likely notice a difference. The dimples on my butt are less pronounced, the only thing I don&#x27;t like is that they made the size smaller with this new packaging but other than that good product.</li>
    <li> I waited to rate this product until I completely used all of it. This product didnt work at all and i didnt see any difference. I also used it twice a day everyday until it was all gone.</li>
    <li> Works very good with diet and exercise but the jar is to small for the price. ...</li>
    <li> Amazing love it works great for my legs</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using the product long enough to see major results, but I do see some of my stretch marks getting lighter and it is an awesome moisturizer!</li>
    <li> Ready to get rid of that cellulite or at least make it appear gone</li>
    <li> Smells great, dries quickly, and the ingredients seem legit for what it is intended to do</li>
    <li> I have used this for 5 days and don&#x27;t feel or look different yet. I am hoping by the end of 2 weeks I will see a difference.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Noticeable reduction in cellulite after 2 weeks!</li>
    <li> Cannot wait to see the results from this!</li>
    <li> Love the texture of this cream!</li>
    <li> the texture is great and absorbs really well! i just started using it for almost a week and i can tell theres a slight difference, but I guess it&#x27;s too soon to tell</li>
    <li> Girl really likes this cream, and is already seeing results.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Cellulite Cream now for almost a week and the consistency of the cream thick and creamy, I’ve use it 2X a day like the jar recommends…but overall I haven&#x27;t been using it long to really say it works or not, but I do love the way it feels on my skin, and I am starting to see a slight difference on my thighs...let’s just hope it’s not a figment of my imagination!</li>
    <li> Have used the whole jar, no visible results. The smell is horrid! Had to make sure I applied this only if I knew I would not be around anyone. Stunk up my sheets terribly.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for about 2 weeks now and I have noticed a slight difference in the appearance of cellulite on the back of my upper thighs. The directions recommend using it twice a day (morning and night) although I do not always do this. I do not think I&#x27;ve used it long enough to see the full benefits yet but the results I&#x27;ve seen so far is promising. The cream also leaves my skin feeling soft and it smells pretty nice.</li>
    <li> amazing amazing amazing cream number 1 cellulite cream will order many and many</li>
    <li> So far so good, have noticed a difference</li>
    <li> It arrived in a timely and good condition.  So far I am very pleased with the product.  It is easy to apply and seems to be actually producing some results.  It is early days so I am expecting to see even better results in the coming days and weeks. I have ordered the product again.</li>
    <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and a half. I didn&#x27;t completely expect it to work but thought I&#x27;d give it a try. Applied to my midriff under my ribs where I have very little cellulite and on the back of my thighs where cellulite is more prominent. While I have noticed a difference in cellulite it is due to working out 6 days a week and eating clean for the last 6 weeks. I will say it leaves your skin extremely soft after using it. Also, the smell is terrible &amp; extremely strong so beware for that. I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> Worked really well :) non offensive odor.</li>
    <li> Its nice and thick and leaves your skin very soft</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 5 days now and I really love the consistency and the smell. My results so far are not as quick but I&#x27;m sure with more time I will see a bigger change. It does keep me moisturized and my skin very soft</li>
    <li> Love this Cellulite cream.</li>
    <li> I AM STILL USING THIS CREAM, IT&#x27;S VERY GOOD I&#x27;M HAPPY I BOUGHT IT. MY CELLULITE ARE NOT COMPLETELY GONE OR HAVE SHOWN MUCH IMPROVEMENT BUT I KNOW GOOD RESULTS TAKE TIME. I&#x27;M GOING TO CONTINUE USING AS IT HELPS SMOOTH MY SKIN AND LOOK HEALTHIER. CUSTOMER SERVICE IS AMAZING, THANK YOU FOR CHECK UP ON ME IT&#x27;S IMPORTANT FOR ME TO KNOW THAT YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR CUSTOMERS. AMAZING PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I have only used this for a short time so I would need more time to evaluate but I love the smell and texture and will revisit after more use.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Works quickly and produces great results. A+++</li>
    <li> Love this product. It really works!! It tone and faded some of my problematic cellulite area.</li>
    <li> i like this product very much actually, it leaves the skin feeling great! the only reason why i gave it a 4 and not a 5 is because of the smell, it literally looks and smells like peanut butter... i feel its waaaay to strong, but other than that if youre looking for results for better skin, this isnt a bad one.</li>
    <li> Great smell and great price for the size. Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> The strength of the retinal and caffeine in this cellulite cream is perfect for everyday use against cellulite. You can feel it as it soaks into your skin, it makes you skin feel fresh and healthy. It is awesome because you know that it is working. It takes a couple weeks to actually see the results, but it has been worth it for me, it has been making some stubborn stretch marks lighter that I have not been able to previously take care of with other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Tried Discounted Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]</li>
    <li> I been using this for Almost 10 days only one time a day after I take a shower and I Love  how my skin look alot smoother the only thing I dont like is the smell But is not really bad But I would prefer no scent or something more fresh, I feel if I dont use it for one day the textura of my skin changes back to what it was</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say yet, still testing, will update review</li>
    <li> The smell is not good</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really see any different after using it for two weeks like some people say. I was consistent for two week later but after no results I just use it here and there until gone.</li>
    <li> this is my 3nd order. i like it i see the difference in my cellulite its disappearing slowly..thank you</li>
    <li> This product is great!</li>
    <li> V. Nice .good smell and you can feel the result after 1 week of application</li>
    <li> This product improved the appearance of my thighs. It firmed and toned my legs, and felt extremely hydrating on my dry skin. I noticed improvement after two weeks of use</li>
    <li> Great product I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days but I think it&#x27;s helping.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many creams &amp; gels.  This is by far my favorite.  I like the consistency of it and no strong minty smell.  Combined with exercise, healthy eating, and plenty of water, I find it to be the best cream I&#x27;ve tried.  Four stars since it is not an overly large jar.</li>
    <li> I only received this product about a week and half ago and I am already noticing a difference in my outer thigh area it&#x27;s less dimpled and more smooth them it was before I started the cream</li>
    <li> Very smoothing. Great so far!</li>
    <li> waste of money. doesn&#x27;t do anything and it smells AWFUL</li>
    <li> I like the slight tingle I get when I use this cream.  I haven&#x27;t used it enough to see if it makes real results but I&#x27;m sure it would if I were consistent with it.  I like the smell of it and the consistency as well.</li>
    <li> The cream is smooth and smells nice. I can&#x27;t tell if it works, but then again my cellulite is very mild. Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> Very coffee like smell, which I love.  I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve seen too many results yet, but if nothing else, it&#x27;s sooting for my skin!</li>
    <li> It is nice as cream but didn&#x27;t work on cellulite</li>
    <li> It really smells like cocoa butter. I don&#x27;t really like that smell, so I will buy something else next time. But I do notice it works. It has retinol, which is the only thing proven to rejuvenate skin, so this is otherwise a good product. Just really dislike the smell of cocoa butter. Consistency is also similar to cocoa butter, and the residue is a little greasy. But it works.</li>
    <li> Love this product - have only been using for a week but can tell a difference already! Great company - the best, stands behind all their products!</li>
    <li> This cream is amazing, its reduced my cellulite in a noticeable way. It did take approximately three weeks of daily use for me to notice a smoother skin level but its great.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try it.</li>
    <li> This will probably take months to know if it is working but it is a pleasant product to use. The smell is good and I like the way it feels.</li>
    <li> I love this product. one of my top favs!! I just started using it so not too sure about end results yet, but any kind of scrub is great for your skin. It smells like a fresh cup of coffe &amp; leave your skin so smooth &amp; soft</li>
    <li> So far it is helping reduce the cellulite, it hasn&#x27;t completely gotten rid of it so I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars yet.  Over time I&#x27;ll update my review.</li>
    <li> I used this product for 2 weeks then took 1 week off for vacation and while on vacation I noticed I still have so you leave I&#x27;m not saying that it doesn&#x27;t work but it did not work for me.  I was given a discount to try this product for my review.</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin feeling moisturized and soft! Helps smoothen out my skin tone and makes it look less bumpy. Great product!</li>
    <li> No woman on the planet likes or doesn&#x27;t mind cellulite, some of us are lucky due to good genetics and unfortunately some of us have to work a little harder and use some good creams for this issue and this cream does actually work.  It did take some time for me to see results but it was worth the wait. Would rather be patient and use something natural with no harmful chemicals than to use something that works a little faster but is bad for you and can cause serious skin issues. In the end with working out and applying this cream and wrapping my thighs with seran wrap every night,I started to see results in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> How do you compare the hundreds of skin care products? I&#x27;m a regular tester, so I&#x27;ve arrived at a list of key considerations. I hope these help you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Fragrance: Smells like coffee with undertones of baby powder. Can’t say I love it, but it’s not unpleasant. Doesn’t follow you around, an hour after application I can smell it only if I sniff my skin. Ingredient list contains fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;~ Feel during application: Slightly creamy with a powdery feeling.&lt;br /&gt;~ Feel after absorption (Soft? Oily? Sticky? Moist? Tight?): Smooth, moisturized, not oily or sticky but you can feel something there.&lt;br /&gt;~ Is it best for a certain skin type?: I wouldn’t use it on an oily face, but this is more of a body cream. I’d say any skin type, especially dry.&lt;br /&gt;~ Is it tested on animals?: No.&lt;br /&gt;~ Immediate cosmetic effects:* Makes skin slightly glossy, gets rid of the dusty look of dry skin. Looks moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;~ Potential long-term effectiveness:* Pretty awesome. I don’t know about the cellulite reduction, I’ll update the review after a month or two of use. That&#x27;s a tough nut to crack. But this is stuffed to the gills with stuff that will be great for your skin regardless. The ingredients are too numerous to list, but there’s no way your skin doesn’t improve after using this for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Know the difference between cosmetic and long-term effects: Cosmetic effects are immediate and only present when the product has been applied recently - just like makeup. Long-term effects take longer to see and should remain when you stop using the product (but don&#x27;t  - your skin needs continuing support). The ideal product would be both cosmetically and long-term effective, but it&#x27;s more realistic to expect a formula to tilt towards one or the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other notes: Generously sized 4-oz container means you can actually use it. Ingredients are a skin-care powerhouse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review.

    <li> Absolutely love this cream. Left my skin soft and hydrated.</li>
    <li> Good product if you can get passed the smell. A little too strong for me personally. Shake before opening each time because it separates upon sitting.</li>
    <li> i feel like it works, but hate the smell.</li>
    <li> Its a really good moisturizing cream, couldn&#x27;t see the result yet, probably need more time to check.</li>
    <li> Great product! It has made mu cellulites fade. I recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> I got this yesterday and so far I love the feel, the smell is slightly strong but it isn&#x27;t cloying or unpleasant to me it is a bit masculine smelling. it is a thick but non greasy cream and like many of the other reviews I have to agree it is very much like body butter. I recently lost about 40 lbs and I am trying to help myself out with preventing loose skin and cellulite, i still have a way to go and this is hopefully going to help, with all the research i have done, everything that seems to work on cellulite on any level  excepting surgery is included in this product  so I am very excited about trying this out . I&#x27;ll try and post a progress review in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> The smell is horrendous but it does have a small tightening effect. I prefer coconut oil!</li>
    <li> Saw no difference after using the cream</li>
    <li> The smell to me was very unpleasant therefore I do t think I will be using it... I am going to give it away to my sister and later on update my review to see how it went with her.</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly. It absorbs well but I&#x27;m still trying to decide if I like the scent. It does fade though. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see results.</li>
    <li> Skin seems smoother. I understand the product won&#x27;t make my cellulite disappear but by smoothing the skin it is definitely not as noticeable. It does not have an overpowering scent either. So far so good.</li>
    <li> Only been using for a few days so not sure if it works yet, but wanted to warn that it does have a strong musky smell and remains pretty sticky / thick (like super thick suntan lotion) for hours after you apply it. I&#x27;ve used other cellulite creams in the past and stopped for this reason (tired of clothes and sheets smelling like cellulite cream). Was hoping because this was instanatural and I love their other products, this would be different, but it&#x27;s not. I&#x27;m gonna continue to give it a shot, but wanted to post this for those thinking they&#x27;d get a light cream with a floral scent (based on other reviews). Not so much!</li>
    <li> I am very excited to try this cream. I just received it 2 days ago and love it so far. With Amazon prime I received it in 2 days. The cream is thick and rubs into skin nicely.  The cream is very moisturizing b I have not had any skin irritation.  I can&#x27;t say if it  works on cellulite yet since I have only had the product for 2 days.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for 3 weeks and 2 days, twice a day! I just ran out of my first bottle this morning. Tomorrow, I&#x27;m opening my second bottle. I bought two bottles at once since I was skeptical of the bottle only being 5 oz.&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my lower tummy and the backs of my thighs.Also, I really make sure I massage it in for 2 minutes at least in a circular motion with pressure and up- and- down motion with pressure. This helps the circulation.&lt;br /&gt; My thighs look already improved but not completely where I want them to be. My tummy does not look much different however I also have stretch marks from my daughter and my skin is looser there so its tougher to rub in. I am going to buy a cellulite brush as well so that I can use that for five minutes before rubbing in the lotion each time. I&#x27;ve read that the brush helps the circulation so I&#x27;m sure that will help improve the appearance as well.&lt;br /&gt;This is the first product I&#x27;ve tried for cellulite and I love everything about it except the smell. It&#x27;s not terrible or super strong but I am not a fan of shea butter smells. BUT, the pros of this product outweigh the smell haha.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely try this product if you are looking for an improvement in your cellulite issues! I&#x27;VE ONLY USED IT 3 WEEKS AND I SEE AN IMPROVEMENT!!</li>
    <li> Smells similar to cocoa butter.  I am excited to see the results!</li>
    <li> The smell could be worked on but I do look forward to seeing results.</li>
    <li> Well packaged product, came in a timely manor.  The smell was a little different not unplesant.  The feel of the lotion on the skin is Great..  Would order again...</li>
    <li> Cream smells good and is easy to apply.</li>
    <li> I am so sad that it did not work. I waist my money for nothing. The smell is not good</li>
    <li> great cellulite cream</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t see a difference but I feel one. It definitely makes your skin feel softer if nothing else</li>
    <li> Excellent product! As an athletic child turned full time adult with responsibilities, I of course suffer from issues with cellulite. Used this on thigh and stomach areas and it greatly reduced the obvious signs of cellulite. No funky odors, doesn&#x27;t feel streaky, works great.</li>
    <li> I want skeptical to purchase this cellulite cream because they all say they work but usually not.  Well, I can honestly say that it definitely reduces the appearance of the dimples that I have on my upper legs, thighs, and buttocks areas!! The smell and texture is amazing!  Skin feels so soft, smooth, and smells good! I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking to reduce those dimples on your body.</li>
    <li> This cellulite cream came in a great container you can open and scoop out nice amount and message in. It&#x27;s a beige brown color and is thick like Shea butter, and a kinda chocolate smell probably from cocoa butter. I love that it has caffeine and s great blend of wonderful things that really hydrate and smooth out your skin. It didn&#x27;t get rid if my cellulite completely yet ( been using a couple weeks and will continue) but tightens and tones the area on my legs and now in shorts I am not self conscious.Thank you InstaNatural for allowing me to try this product for a small fee and my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> NOT a fan, never got to use it enough to see if it actually work due to the smell.</li>
    <li> This is amazing cream. I have used it for about a week now and I can already tell a difference and so can my husband. I am 5&#x27;6&amp;#34;, 146 pounds and wear size 6-8 in clothing. I work out and for 49 I am told I look much more like 35. That said, I have always had an inclination to dimply bits around the upper thigh and bum - believe me, the older I get the harder to keep this under control. I feel new motivation in my work outs and diet because of this cream. I am seeing such noticeable improvement that I want to push myself harder than ever and see if I can take my 50&#x27;s to a whole new level. I&#x27;m not saying I look like I had 5 lbs of liposuction on each thigh, but this is truly a distinct improvement. Highly recommend this and I WILL buy it again and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing - it is an unusual texture with a tendency for some of the natural oils to come to the top, not unlike peanut butter. Also it is kind of a beige-tan color which surprised me. There is a scent because it has several natural herbs and oils. I like it, kind of woodsy, so does my husband but I can see how some people might not be keen on it. It does diminish once on the skin for about 10-15 minutes. If you like earthy, musk or wood scents then this will subtly blend with your perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it - so glad I found it, it sounds unreal but I feel like it gave me a new leash on life!</li>
    <li> The cream works. I used it day and night as recommended.  I do see my cellulite slowly disappearing. I just ordered my second bottle.</li>
    <li> I love this cream feels good great for skin and its working for me for my experience ... still using it today I wanna know more effect of this product I&#x27;ll come back if I notice some changes  and write more reviews here soon.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a difference but I love instanatural products</li>
    <li> I used this for 3 weeks. Ive niticed a slight difference</li>
    <li> smell is amazing. leaves my skin feeling very soft.&lt;br /&gt;as far as it actually working, THAT I am not sure of just yet. I will update review once I have seen a change.</li>
    <li> Love this cream.  I could see a difference in my skin in less then a week. What makes this cream better then others is the smell.  It smells like coffee ice cream and I have tried several creams that smell awful.  I am extremely happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> This is my first time using a cellulite cream &amp; i love it! You can actually feel tingling on your body! I always wear tight shorts or a tight shirt to kind of let the product set in. The smell isn&#x27;t too great, but the product itself is great!</li>
    <li> Love the smell and super creamy!</li>
    <li> I have only been using for a week along with a cellulite brush that I bought and this stuff works great along with my diet and exercise of course!</li>
    <li> Considering the short amount of time I have been using this product,  I have already seen significant results. I can&#x27;t wait to see how much my skin will improve!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know if it works yet but it&#x27;s very hydrating and I&#x27;m a fan of those natural ingredients</li>
    <li> This cream does seem to do what it says it will do as far as smoothing out the skin.  Kind of has a tightening effect.  The only thing is that I can&#x27;t stand the smell and it leaves my skin with a tight feeling and not sift and smooth. So, I use it on my legs only and the smell doesn&#x27;t bother me so much and it keeps them looking tight and smooth.</li>
    <li> Smell too strong and not sure work it</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I received my cream. I have been searching for a cream like this one for along time. I have tried almost everything to combat cellulite. I tired taking pills all kind of cream over the counter cream and nothing seemed to work. I order this cream and I apply it every night and I have noticed a difference.  I truly amazed and happy with this product. If you are like me who hates cellulite and won&#x27;t wear a skirt or shorts then this product is for you.</li>
    <li> Wife is trying this product and she love it... Great smell and smooth she would recommend to use...</li>
    <li> This has been doing some amazing things for my cellulite on my legs!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  At first I wasn&#x27;t sure.  I wasn&#x27;t sure what I was expecting when I opened the lid.... but I was a little shocked by the color and consistency of it.  The smell is wonderful.  It makes my skin feel wonderful.  Also.... it leaves a wonderful cooling effect after I put it on.  I am thinking it is from the witch hazel that is in this product.  All ingredients are natural.  I can&#x27; say enough good things about this cream.  Not sure if my cellulite is much better... but I will continue to use it because i love the way it makes my skin feel.... I was offered a promotional discount to test and give my honest opinion</li>
    <li> I think it works, but it smells a bit weird.</li>
    <li> i refunded it... it seems the one I received has already been a while and not sure whether is safr to use or not.....not recommended at all</li>
    <li> Works really well. Noticeable difference when I use it versus when I forget. Even my husband notices.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I received this product at discount in exchange for my honest review. I received it quickly, big plus since I was anxious to give it a try. I&#x27;m in the 25-30 age range &amp; having issues in thighs &amp; my bottom. I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in the last 2 weeks using it. I maintain the  twice a day as suggested using about the size of a nickel for each side. It&#x27;s important to remember while this does aid, to achieve optimal results maintain a balanced diet &amp; exercise regimen. I do not use this in place of either, just to give it that extremely oomph!</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for a week now and even though I have not yet seen improvement in my cellulite, I can certainly tell that the cream does my skin a whole lot of good. You can even feel the difference in your skin even hours after applying it. At night my skin still felt super smooth and hydrated. I don&#x27;t have a lotion or cream that can leave the skin feeling so good in texture like this one can!  *update: after running out of this hair mask I noticed my hair started falling out again. It really did help my hair strong.</li>
    <li> just started using it, so far its working good on me. looking forward for more good result from it.</li>
    <li> Product got here on time. Feels great on my skin. Still using it so I&#x27;ll review again after I have used for a while. So far so good</li>
    <li> Not my favorite scent in the world... Actually my least fav. So I will be giving my sister this to use, it&#x27;s almost a gingery cinnamon smell.... Spicy and sweet just not my thing</li>
    <li> Noticed  an improvement in the appearance of the cellulite  after the first 24 hours 3/28/2015 Still improving.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed a difference yet but makes my skin very soft and has a light subtle scent.  Even if results aren&#x27;t as promised would still be a great lotion!  Will keep using to see if it works!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still waiting for the verdict on the cellulite, but I really dislike the smell of the cream. If it really works, great, it&#x27;s worth it. But I&#x27;ve only been using it a couple of weeks so I&#x27;ll edit my review after a few months.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to be able to tell is it&#x27;s really working. Don&#x27;t care for the smell though.</li>
    <li> Definitely minimizes the appearance and goes on smoothly without a sticky or oily feel after.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of cellulite creams but in order to work, you must use them! I use this one &amp; it works! Within the first week of using it, I began to see results that lasted longer each time of use. I use it after I shower. Even my stomach is beginning to show definition &amp; a waist! I love it BCBS you don&#x27;t have to use as much as with most other cellulite creams.</li>
    <li> Honest review. This stuff was amazing. Not only did it tighten my skin but it smelled great too. Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Thank you for a quick refund! Awesome!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my cellulite its almost gone</li>
    <li> Can see the difference after using the cream for a month and also brought another jar.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working so far. I will come back and review once I have been able to test it for a longer period of time.</li>
    <li> Definitely helped with my cellulite, I will be buying this again!</li>
    <li> I like it, but like some of the other reviewers have said, it does have a strange smell, not bad, not great, just... different.  Other than that, it seems to keep my skin in the affected areas very hydrated, but I can&#x27;t honestly say I&#x27;ve seen a difference in the appearance of my skin.</li>
    <li> I have bought a bunch of products from this company before. They make affordable beauty products with good ingredients. This one is good as well. My wife uses it and likes the way it makes her skin feel. Although, it hasn&#x27;t reduced her cellulite. If you&#x27;re looking for soft skin though, it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** received for review and inspection purposes **</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for a friend. They are a size 10 but still has bad cellulite. She is really happy with this product and pleased it is made from all natural ingredients.Recommended</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference in my cellulite and it leaves a greasy feeling to my skin.  I still have it three stars because it makes my skin feel really soft after the greasy feeling goes away.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING!  I love how it feels, and it has been helping my skin look smoother and more youthful!</li>
    <li> Great cellulite cream... very thick texture but not greasy,  help moisturize my skin but still looking forward to see the result.&lt;br /&gt;Cons : Dislike the scent</li>
    <li> Just received this item as part of a promotion and was able to snag it a t a low price.  The item is a bit masculine for me, musty if you will.  Maybe it&#x27;ll grow on me.</li>
    <li> Product smelled and looked rancid.</li>
    <li> Received this item in a discount for a product review. I love topical creams to help reduce cellulite.</li>
    <li> I have this ugly cellulite on my thighs, butt and my arms. I hate it! I recently started working out and I decided to use this cream along so I can get better results. This will moisturizers, hydrate and tight my skin. Working out drinking water, eating healthy along with the usage of this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream smells so good smells like coffee with cocoa I love it. I smell like coffee all day lol so if you like that smells this cream is for you. The coffee helps to time and tighten the appearance of your skin. This cream contains coffee, retinol, vitamin c and e. Among with other great natural and organic ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream hydrates and moisturizes my skin. It also contains green tea working as a antioxidant. There is no burning , no discomfort and no bad smells. You won&#x27;t feel the cream. The cream is thick and can last you a very long time. I will continue to use this cream. I recommend you to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product to sample, review and give you a honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a month now and my legs look A-MAZ-ING! I love how my thighs look now and can&#x27;t wait to give some to my sister to try. Great product and great price. Very happy customer here!</li>
    <li> Ohh! This stuff is amazing! So moisturizing I put it on my thighs my tummy and sides and booty, it gets like warm like you can feel it working! Will have to buy again, and soon cause I love uhhut everywhere! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I like the product leaves my skin smooth , still using to see results, it&#x27;s a just a little big strong on the Shea butter ordor well in my opinion</li>
    <li> This stuff smells AWFUL! It is like a mixture of cigarette butts and Curve cologne for men. If you can get past the overpowering smell (which i have managed lately thanks to a sinus infection) this stuff will make your skin feel amazing.</li>
    <li> I was given this product at a very good price in exchange of a good review.  So far i like it, I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and noticed a small difference in my legs.</li>
    <li> Received this product and the oil was separated from the cream. I mixed it well but the oil still separated the next day. Also this product leaves ur skin VERY greasy!!! I applied a very small amount (half a dime size) to the back of my thighs (I&#x27;m 5&#x27;6&amp;#34;) and when I ran my fingertips over the application site, my fingertips were shiny from the grease. Only used this product twice and threw it away because it was too greasy.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like the smell....  Glad I got this on a trial basis price....</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift.  Recipient LOVES it.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> smell not to my liking</li>
    <li> I’ll be honest here I don’t have full length mirrors in my house (ya for me, I’d be scared lol) No claims are made that this beauty product eliminates cellulite but, it is said that the Retinol helps boost collagen production to repair and restore stretched tissue. I do love that this product is rich, thick, goes on smooth and smells great. It definitely feels like it has more hydrating properties to keep skin smoother! It does leaves your skin feeling ultra soft and smooth. Not greasy, but does leave more sheen on the skin compared to a moisturizer. I&#x27;d purchase this product again, especially for helping get back of legs looking pretty for summer months.</li>
    <li> kinda thick. wasn&#x27;t expecting that. and the smell is a little off? but it seems to saturate my skin and I look forward to the results.</li>
    <li> Visibly reduces vericrose veins and cellulite on first application! I&#x27;m ecstatic to find something that&#x27;s works, I&#x27;ve had varicrose veins since I was 15 and they have gotten worse and worse in the past 5 years which is embarrasing at 20 years old, could never afford laser treatments - decided to give this a try and will order again.</li>
    <li> love the way my skin looks and feels.</li>
    <li> I love that there is a product that not only reduces cellulite, but also reduces stretch marks! I have been using this about a week now and can already tell a difference.</li>
    <li> I loved the product... rich and creamy and easily soaked into my skin making it feel instantly smoother and softer.</li>
    <li> I love how gently it went on my skin and there was no greasy residue after. It helped my skin look more firm and decreased the appearance of &amp;#34;dimples&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was very gentle on my skin and I am happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Been using this for a week and I can tell a difference, hopefully in a month it&#x27;s going to be amazing.</li>
    <li> Fast shipment, an excellent product!</li>
    <li> The smell is offputting , so I don&#x27;t use it as frequently as i should to see the results.</li>
    <li> I enjoy the soft smell of this lotion.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell great, buuuut,,, It does make my skin super soft!</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this cream. She said her legs are feeling softer and I think so too.</li>
    <li> Love it so far! I&#x27;ve been using it on the backs of my thighs and I think I am seeing improvement!</li>
    <li> Very nice size bottle. I love that the texture of the cream is not so thick considering it has cocoa butter in it. Great moisturizer for the cellulite left behind from my pregnancies. I like to use it with the InstaNatural Stretch Mark and Scar Cream for optimum results. I have used other InstaNatural products also and they have made me a fan!</li>
    <li> In the past, I would try cellulite creams and throw them out after a week or two. They felt sticky or wouldn&#x27;t absorb into my skin well. Even though I&#x27;ve been using InstaNatural&#x27;s cellulite cream for a little over two weeks, it&#x27;s definitely a keeper. Now, it hasn&#x27;t been a miracle cure to my skin, but it actually ABSORBS into my skin. Another thing I noticed was, there&#x27;s a light coffee scent, which the other creams I&#x27;ve used didn&#x27;t have. So, they were not lying about the caffeine in this product. Thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product. I see the results in my problem areas, less dimpling on my skin also smoother and firmer. I will continue using it since I already love the results. I tried their improved formula cream and I&#x27;m as happy as I was with their first cream. The difference that I see is the cream texture, it contains more ingredients. It&#x27;s a product that I will continue use in the future</li>
    <li> Great Products! Awesome Seller!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first to try this product, but I figured hey it&#x27;s worth a shot.  I have been using this product for the past three weeks and can honestly say there is some improvement.  I have been applying it on my rear area and upper thighs. It is thick and has a wonderful smell!  It is not too heavy or greasy. After applying my skin actually feels tighter and toned, in small increments. All in all I am very pleased with the results and would recommend this product.  I think with continued use there would be significant long term benefits!!</li>
    <li> I could tell from the moment I opened this lotion that it would work well. I have done a homemade version of a cellulite lotion with coffee in it and it worked well but was messy to make. The lotion had a similar smell to what I had made before and it did not disappoint. The only downside, in fact, is the smell, which is a bit more pungent than I prefer. But it is worth it seeing that it really does work to reduce the appearance of cellulite. It will not remove your cellulite, because NO topical cream can do that. But it does temporarily reduce the appearance of cellulite when you need it to (like when you&#x27;re out on the beach). This stuff is good quality.</li>
    <li> When you open it theres a very strong smell but other than that it a good consistency for  a cream. It goes on smoothly and my skin is looking better. I was given a discount on this product for an honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I like this cream  -- I use it every night on my arms and I have noticed improved skin tone.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t get rid of my cellulite even after I finished the bottle. I didn&#x27;t notice any changes in the appearance of my thighs other than extremely smooth and super soft skin and that is why I gave it four stars. It is a rich thick cream formula with a pleasant smell that is extremely moisturising. That is the only reason I gave it such high rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I was sent this product to try out and review. This has no bearing on my review as I have shared my honest experience and opinion. To see my detailed review please visit my blog thebeautyanalytic.blogspot.com</li>
    <li> I so badly wanted to like this product. I have been doing lots of toning exercises and needed a little help with the leftover &amp;#34;dimples.&amp;#34; This product has great ingredients. However, I cannot get past the smell and texture. The smell isn&#x27;t just a masculine smell. It&#x27;s like a masculine scent mixed with putrid... something. I wouldn&#x27;t ever want my husband to smell like this. And it is STRONG. It permeates my clothes and the smell lasts even on my hands for days after ceasing use (despite multiple scrubbing sessions). The cream also separates in between each use. I have to mix it with my finger before each use and it makes a mess, plus leaves little chunks in the cream that are not comfortable to rub onto my body. It doesn&#x27;t really soak into my skin but smears on top of it. I will say that my skin feels incredibly soft after using this cream, but it smells just awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These reviews seem to mention a time where there was a light floral scent and a smooth consistency. I would LOVE to try that version of the product. But with this one, I can&#x27;t get past the scent or texture.</li>
    <li> Works great and smells nice</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tolerate the terrible smell.  Also, the greasy formula ruined an expensive blouse.  However, I am happy with other products by this company.</li>
    <li> Nice cream, feels nice on my skin.</li>
    <li> Two weeks and I&#x27;ve noticed an considerable difference.</li>
    <li> After two times of using, the pump broke. The product is so thick and the pump is too weak. I broke the bottle and put the cream in another container. Did&#x27;t want to hassle with sending it back &amp; have it happen again. Haven&#x27;t used it enough yet. But it is really creamy and helps with making my skin look less dry which helps with making the skin look younger &amp; healthy. Smell is not so pleasant, so I only use it at night.  So we&#x27;ll see. Please fix the pump/bottle InstaNatural.</li>
    <li> I have used it for almost a month and I do not see any signs of it working.</li>
    <li> The best anti cellulite cream ever!!!! It&#x27;s really works, my skin looks beautiful after month of using and I come back to buy this cream again, and love love love</li>
    <li> Made my skin soft an smooth and also light up some of my stretch marks. I like it. feel if you use it constantly you will get the results you are looking for. I did for about 3weeks. Good stuff</li>
    <li> I really like what this cream does to make my skin look firmer.  The only thing is that the smell bothers me, and that&#x27;s probably because it&#x27;s natural and I&#x27;m so used to artificial smelling products, so it&#x27;s probably not a bad thing!  After just a few days the cellulite on my thighs seemed less apparent.  Definitely worth trying.</li>
    <li> I love this cream for a bunch of reasons. First off all it has no heavy fragrances or dyes and I have extremely sensitive skin. Also I just got this today and when I used it I already saw immediate reduction in cellulite and stretch marks.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have seen results in just a month! It makes my skin so soft. I will keep using this!!!</li>
    <li> love this saw results with first use!  will reorder this</li>
    <li> Makes skin feel soft and haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in cellulite.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve not used this long but, no results yet. *Honest review for discount *</li>
    <li> Awesome product!!  I can see results already!</li>
    <li> I used for a week i waiting yo see</li>
    <li> I’ve been using it for only a few days and love the results. The cream is nice and rich, and has a nice scent. It absorbs quickly and definitely holds the moisture throughout the day. However,it’s best to use the cream two more times per day, as needed. I found that it definitely smoothed my skin tone and texture. I’ll be adding it to my skincare routine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I was provided a complimentary sample. All opinions are my own</li>
    <li> I have had bad cellulite for almost 10 years and nothing has ever really worked. I&#x27;ve purchased several cellulite products over the years; however, this is only product that is working for me. I have been using this cream for two weeks now, and while I haven’t seen mind-blowing results in this short time, I have definitely noticed my skin is a bit tighter and more firm. I use the product twice a day and find it feels best when I use it right after a shower. I’m definitely going to keep using this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided by the seller for evaluation purposes</li>
    <li> Smells great.  Thick and creamy.  My skin does appear tighter.</li>
    <li> I have noticed subtle difference in skin tone and texture. I use the product on my mid thigh to my bottom. I have gone through one container of this product and hope that with continued use the positive difference will continue. The scent is has a hint of coca to coffee. Shipping is quick and packaging ensures that every drop of the product has availability for use.</li>
    <li> excellent cream, lov it!!!</li>
    <li> This is the first cream I&#x27;ve ever purchased to address my cellulite. I didnt know what to expect, but after reading reviews and seeing the rating I decided to give it a shot! BIG MISTAKE! The first thing I noticed was a very unpleasant smell.. it stinks.. not just a little but a lot! And then there were like little chunks of something in the cream (maybe it wasn&#x27;t mixed property??) And they scratched and irritated my skin.. only attempted to use once and won&#x27;t try again! Completely disappointed and upset I wasted my money!! Dont do it! You&#x27;ve been warned!</li>
    <li> So far so good. It&#x27;s a thick cream with a light scent. Not too bad but it seems like it works</li>
    <li> Used immediately on my thighs. Saw difference in 24 hrs after applying.  Would definitely reccomend</li>
    <li> Seems to be working tightening up loose skin on my arms and neck. Just not crazy about the floral scent it seems to be more geared towards women.</li>
    <li> This is a great firming cream! Cellulite is not a huge problem for me, but I can attest to the fact that this product does tighten the skin with continued use. Firming lotion is a must have after you become a mom and this is one of my new favorites.  I love the consistency of this cream as well as the ingredients.  Retinol and cocoa and shea butter pack a powerful punch.  I would definitely recommend trying this out, especially if you have trip to the beach planned!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure everybody has seen the cellulite on thunder thighs. It&#x27;s so hard to get rid of. Even when you lose weigh you still have the fat dimples in places. I saw so bummed out about my cellulite that I was considering getting a surgical procedure called cellulaze, but when I tried this cellulite cream it started smoothing away the dimples!! It&#x27;s smooths the entire area that you apply it to. I notice a tremendous difference after about a week! It&#x27;s awesome you guys should try it!!! This is a free product used for review purposes!!!</li>
    <li> Some things are inevitable and cellulite just happens to be one of them. I can&#x27;t say it affects everyone but it&#x27;s definitely a struggle for most, whether or not they admit it. So what do we do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what do we do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We surf the web in hunt for survival, a quick fix that can be purchased and shipped over night. Unfortunately this is not a quick fix! Having a few dimples here is nothing to really stress about.  RIGHT? ... Try exercising to tone but a little cream couldn&#x27;t hurt as well. Well of course not... I got my hands on a new product and here&#x27;s the scoop; I tried this Cellulite Cream with Caffeine + Retinol and I was a little skeptical but so far so good. It is easy to use, it comes in a plastic bottle with a pump, It&#x27;s not messy and not runny. Its very absorbent and non greasy. It has a nice cocoa butter scent that&#x27;s not overbearing or irritating. Cocoa butter is also a very common scent and a common ingredient for skin care as well.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any side effects from the cream. My skin felt smoother and firmer after just one use. I am anxious and excited to see continued results.  If your looking for a quality cellulite cream you should definitely try this cream and as with most things it takes time to get results.</li>
    <li> An amazing product!  It didn&#x27;t smooth on very easily, but once you get it applied it does the trick! My skin felt more supple and the cellulite spots were reduced and softer!</li>
    <li> I have really been loving Insta Naturals in General i have had the pleasure of reviewing quite a few of there products already and i am super pleased and happy with my results ! this cream has really helped minimize the looks of my cellulite and i can actually see smoother skin the smell is very pleasent as well! #sponserd</li>
    <li> You can really feel the product working as soon as you put it on and you can notice a difference the next day. The formula wasn&#x27;t heavy and my skin absorbed it very well.</li>
    <li> InstaNatural&#x27;s Cellulite Cream contains a unique formula that smooths out your cellulite and firms your skin up! The two main active ingredients are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Caffeine: stimulates the blood flow circulation to tone and tighten skin.&lt;br /&gt;2) Retinol: boosts collagen production to repair and restore stretched tissues, so you can obtain long-lasting results.&lt;br /&gt;Together, the formula smooths out, tightens, and evens your skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texture: thick yet very soft and creamy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finish: sinks into your skin quickly and softens your skin, without leaving behind a greasy residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent: slightly perfumey and medicinal, which I believe is due to the potent active ingredients. However, the scent fades quickly and will not interfere with your perfume or distract you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience after seven days of twice-daily use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My cellulite is definitely less noticeable, and faded by 50%. I have faith that it will fade even more as I continue to use it!&lt;br /&gt;My skin is softer, smoother, and definitely firmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Key Ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Caffeine&lt;br /&gt;Retinol&lt;br /&gt;Cocoa Butter&lt;br /&gt;Shea Butter&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin B5</li>
    <li> I recently tried out this Cellulite cream in hope of helping to tone my back upper thigh area which seems to be a problem area for a lot of men and women and I think it is pretty great! Although you cannot completely reduce the signs of cellulite, this product does help tone these problem areas and definitely reduce the sight of it. It does have a little bit of an odd smell I expect from the cocoa and the cream is definitely thicker than a regular lotion but does not take away from the product. If you&#x27;re looking for a skin toner to help tighten certain areas I do recommend this.</li>
    <li> This product Smells good and i notice it works in smaller areas with less work to be done.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve used it long enough to get the full effects.  I can&#x27;t really tell if it&#x27;s working or not.  I don&#x27;t really like the smell, but it&#x27;s a very thick cream.  I&#x27;ve only been using it once a day because I find it difficult for me to use twice a day.</li>
    <li> love the smell. I think this works pretty good.</li>
    <li> The cream I received was separated into brown cream and oil.  I mixed it back together but it still smelled awful and the colour is not the same as other reviewers reported.  It may be a fluke but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll get it again. Luckily, amazon&#x27;s customer service is excellent and refunded me for the cream and shipping.</li>
    <li> InstaNatural: Cellulite Cream&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is part of their Body Creams collection and helps with everything from the cellulite to the dimples a person may suffer from. You get a boost from:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caffeine- Derived from green tea, which provides you with instant firming and lifting results&lt;br /&gt;Retinol- allows the skin to resurface at a quicker pace, lessening the appearance of the cellulite/dimples&lt;br /&gt;Cocoa Butter- softens and also helps keep the skin looking beautiful&lt;br /&gt;Shea Butter- allows the “newer” skin to get a healthy amount of nutrients and moisture&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C- helps your skin hold more moisture and gives it a healthy glow (brightens)&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin B5- helps to keep skin soft and healthy, but also provides a smoother look&lt;br /&gt;All products at InstaNatural are made in the USA and never animal tested&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application- The product works best when applied twice a day, just like a facial skincare regimen. You apply the cream to skin that is clean and dry. You simply pump out the amount needed and apply to your thighs, stomach, legs, and anywhere you wish to address! Use a healthy amount of motion to make sure the cream penetrates and the caffeine hits those targeted areas. I went with a deep massage and allowed the cream to fully dry before dressing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What to Expect- Cellulite is one of those attributes you hear everyone has but that does not make you love it, or much less accept it. While over-the-counter products will not fully remove the appearance of the skin, it certainly can diminish it. I’m all for zapping it any way I can and InstaNatural’s Cellulite cream does aid with this pesky little problem. Thank the healthy amount of Caffeine in the product because it not only minimizes the appearance but provides you with instant results. You get to see a difference on the first day but it does not stop there. The cream has a nice amount of moisturizers like Shea Butter and Cocoa Butter, which penetrate and soften the appearance of the cellulite and surrounding skin. Then comes the Retinol punch that helps in not only repairing but rejuvenation, and by this I mean, it helps the “turn-over” process of shedding our “damaged” looking skin quicker.  The Retinol helps produce a less marked skin in less time than if not used! The cellulite/dimple mark will still be present but with continual use, you can achieve a minimizing look and the finer lines will be less visible, along with the dimples. I found the cream to not only help moisturize and produce softer and a more supple skin’s surface, but it also produced a more firmer appearance that was visible to the eye and touch. I am all for the instant results and especially as the days get warmer and the bikini is due to come out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the above product(s) free of charge from InstaNatural.

    <li> Non greasy... the natural ingredients have not made me breakout..</li>
    <li> Its ok. A little oily and i have not seen any difference.</li>
    <li> When I decided to say yes and review this product I was a little worried about how it would smell. When I received the cream I immediately opened it and was so surprised with the scent! It actually smells really nice. I was very happy about that I was afraid of not liking it. It has a fresh/ clean scent to it. The cream is thick but absorbs very quickly into the skin without leaving it oily. I&#x27;ve been using it for 5 days now and have seen an improvement on my thighs. I had one cellulite dimple in particular that I hated! It now looks way better. The cream also leaves my skin so soft. I really love this product!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for just over a week and surprisingly noticed a difference. It&#x27;s always nice to get good results on something and be able to share it with others. Overall i am happy with the cream.</li>
    <li> This is the first cellulite cream I have bought so I will not be able to compare to anything else.  So far I love the way it leaves my skin feeling.  The product itself is on the thicker side which is great.  It is not runny or anything like that.  So far I&#x27;ve seen minor improvement. The only thing for me is the smell.  Its not a good smell nor a bad smell.  Doesn&#x27;t really bother me, but I know some people are very particular with smells.</li>
    <li> I just love all the products by InstaNatural. Always amazing quality and very resonable prices. I have tried their eye gel, face cream, eye serum, facial cleanser and love them all. I use this one for my stretch marks to make my skin tighter and firmer. This product works really well and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I really like this. I&#x27;m actually in love with the consistency of this product. It&#x27;s perfect!!! I use it on my thighs twice a day and I&#x27;m very hopeful for it to work. I also exercise and drink plenty of water so I am really looking forward to positive results. Seriously though the consistency is the best. It also has a light sweet smell. I do use it after a shower and I have to let it dry for a few minutes before putting on clothes.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t know how lasting the effects are but I just started using InstaNatural Cellulite Cream almost 3 days ago. And my skin feels so soft. But the best part is I just happened to be wearing a summer dress, which I rarely go because I wasn&#x27;t fond on my legs, well I could believe my eyes- my skin was radiant and smooth. I thought it was the lighting until I remembered I&#x27;ve been using this anti cellulite cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never expected quick results. I was prepared to have to wait weeks. I am just floored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I have to tell you, it has a fragrance. But I love that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am just so psyched. You read reviews but you never can fully tell until you get it. I m leaving my review in case it helps someone else decide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will  try to update this review in another week or two. But wow! So far I am just amazed and so happy. I may start wearing dresses again more often!</li>
    <li> After multiple uses, I can tell that it is going to work nicely!</li>
    <li> This item came the day after I ordered it, Haven&#x27;t had time to fully test it but the presentation is great.</li>
    <li> This cellulite cream contains retinol, caffeine and vitamin C to help with reducing cellulite on men or women. Should you be looking for a cream to use on your legs, arms. buttocks, stomach or anywhere else on the body. You would like to help with getting rid of cellulite or reduce it.&lt;br /&gt;It is great for both men and women. It is very hydrating on the skin and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or oily. It has organic cocoa butter and shea butter. Which right now is the trend to using the two together in creams.I tested this for quality and am basing my review on my experience! The jojoba oil is another reason for the moisturizing on the skin. When your skin is more hydrated mean your skin can bounce back from wear and tear easier. If your skin is cracking or hard it is not easy to reduce the cellulite.  Not only is this great for cellulite is great for anti-agin benefits and in return give you a younger looking skin. This is not a small size bottle so it will last a while.</li>
    <li> Just because it&#x27;s thee cold winter months doesn&#x27;t mean you should forget about keeping your body looking nice. Everyone has different areas of their body that they aren&#x27;t happy with, and for me it&#x27;s my thighs because of cellulite. I got the chance to try the Instanatural Cellulite cream with Retinol and I absolutely love it, my legs have never looked better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cellulite can happen to anyone, no matter how big or small you are, and it can be something that really affects a person&#x27;s self confidence. The Instanatural Cellulite Cream will detoxify your skin, reduce the appearance of cellulite over time, and improve blood circulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Instanatural Cellulite Cream with Retinol has a thick consistency and goes on like a gel lotion, it&#x27;s extremely hydrating for the skin. It is best to apply this in circular motions all over the affected area at least twice a day. Please be aware that it takes a couple weeks to see results, don&#x27;t give up it will happen! Be sure that you drink plenty of water when using this Cellulite Cream, since it is so detoxifying, you will need the extra water so you don&#x27;t get dehydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Instanatural Cellulite Cream with Retinol has made me feel so much better about my legs. I have been using this for a couple weeks, and I am already able to see noticeable differences. When I apply this product, I can immediately feel the skin get a bit more firm, and I love that I can feel it working. The Instanatural Cellulite Cream with Retinol also has a very pleasant scent to it, and to me its smells like chocolate and not too overpowering. I recommend this product to anyone that has cellulite no matter how minor or severe it may be.  I received this product for evaluation purposes, I never promise a certain review. These are my own opinions.</li>
    <li> I have tried many creams.  I also am one of those people who want to see results right away or I stop using it.  I was so surprised after one week I was seeing great results.  I have never had a cream that worked so fast and so good!  I am a huge fan of this company as I have many of their products.  I will continue to purchase this in hopes to actually be able to wear a bathing suit this year!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about every type of scrub, cream, lotion and oil you could think of to get rid of pesky cellulite, but nothing worked. So I pretty much gave up on eliminating it completely. Once again InstaNatural came to the rescue with their Cellulite Cream which is a total lifesaver. This cream actually works, it doesn&#x27;t just reduce the appearance of cellulite but actually get&#x27;s rid of it by tightening, toning and smoothing the skin. I know, I couldn&#x27;t believe it myself until I actually tried it. But it works, it really works. When I first applied the cream to my upper thighs I had a weird sensation, it kind of tingled and then I realized that was just the cream hard at work to get rid of cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; to read my full review visit my blog meandmyminime.com</li>
    <li> This stuff is very cold when applied to skin but rubs in very nicely. It has a scent but it is tolerable and not overwhelming. I have noticed that immediate after I apply it. My skin looks from and cellulite looks less visible.</li>
    <li> This is not my first cream but this one is so far better than the rest... Thick and you feel is going to work .. I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day for 4 days and it&#x27;s minimizes my cellulite .. Results will be different on ppl but I don&#x27;t have a lot of cellulite thankfully and hopefully this will help prevent it as well I received this at a promotional price for my review and last but not at all least it&#x27;s not smelly!!</li>
    <li> It seems to be doing some toning.  I will continue to use it to see how the product works on a long term basis.  I would recommend it to someone to try if they are looking for this type of product.</li>
    <li> This product made my skin firm. I really liked this stuff. I have cellulite on my back thighs but used this all over my thighs, legs and butt and I felt better skin and I&#x27;m just half done with it. Insta nature is good because of its great ingredients. Don&#x27;t hesitate to try, you will like it!</li>
    <li> Smells horrible. Cannot tell any difference in cellulite reduction.</li>
    <li> So far so good....its too soon to see all the results as promised but I am definitely noticing a difference in my cellulite area on my thighs. Also, it smells great, so I am with that bc I am very sensitive to certain smells in products.</li>
    <li> Works great, smell could use some approving</li>
    <li> It really has helped my thighs look smoother</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 2 weeks now. I see a little result but I&#x27;m planing to finish this whole bottle and see if it really going to work food. I have it a 4 stars because I do not like the smell. I wish it could smell better.</li>
    <li> I used this product once and thought it was doing an ok job....so I reordered and was disappointed it was really oily and separated..... Not sure what happened? I was able to stir and mix together....still smells the same....so hopefully will work the same too? Keep you posted ....:-)</li>
    <li> It is very good cream for celulite. it is really work. I like it</li>
    <li> Positive words to my family and friends about this.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and I must say it&#x27;s very good. Excellent product...Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it works, but I love the smell and the creaminess. I&#x27;ll keep at it and hope for future results!</li>
    <li> Smell was odd but not horrible. I didn&#x27;t notice results but only used one tub.</li>
    <li> I have not been using it long enough but I already see the texture of my skin improve radically, I also love the faint smell of chocolate. the texture is awesome, like whipped mousse, I guess I&#x27;m just hungry. No, seriously, good product.</li>
    <li> I For This At A Discount In Exchange For An Honest Review. This Cream Has My Skin Looking Right And Youthful. I Love It!</li>
    <li> I was a little worried that this product would be like others and not do much of it&#x27;s job, but I can honestly say I have seen results! I have been using it on my back legs, buttocks, and thighs and My cellulite is improving. I doesn&#x27;t take much product to apply and get the whole area i need, so I feel like this bottle will last me awhile. It does have a crazy smell to me but nothing to were I wouldn&#x27;t use it. It maybe just the ingredients so I&#x27;m not to worried about it. It does show results I have been looking for so I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> This smells strange and is a sandpapery texture that doesn&#x27;t feel nice and also doesn&#x27;t blend in without a lot of work.  It might work, I don&#x27;t know.  I can&#x27;t stand to put it on.</li>
    <li> Smells okay.. kind of like cocoa butter. I used it as directed, but haven&#x27;t seen any results.</li>
    <li> InstaNatural never fails to provide its customers with only the BEST, and most high quality products at such an incredibly affordable price in comparison to it&#x27;s leading competitors. Nothing is too good to be true with InstaNatural. I have used many of their products, and will continue to use their products for the rest of my life. I have seen nothing but serious results when it comes to using these products. By far the best. I mean, who wouldn&#x27;t who wouldn&#x27;t trust and use one of the top leading number one selling brands on Amazon? Fantastic products that are surely a must try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s really working but it&#x27;s only been two weeks. I love the smell and texture of it though and would buy more of their products, being all natural is a plus :)</li>
    <li> Seems to be a great product.  Haven&#x27;t seen major results, but like the way it feelsz</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t continue use due to smell. It&#x27;s too thick and very greasy</li>
    <li> Been using for about a month. Very subtle changes noticed</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It has made a big difference on my tummy using it twice daily as instructed. Now where can I get the giant economy size so I can begin using it on my butt and my thighs?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for allowing me to review this product - I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> This cream is sooooo thick and hydrating! The ingredients (Vit C, Retinol, Caffeine, and Cocoa and Shea Butter) are a fabulous combo. I can tell you that I used this in places where my skin texture isn&#x27;t so great and it creates a noticeable improvement, presumably because of the hydration and super duty ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;I was able to try this cream at a promotional price and I have enjoyed using it. I will continue with it! And, as a side note, I&#x27;ve tried severa InstaNatural products and they have all been incredible. You don&#x27;t have to use too much of this because it is so luxurious and does not leave a residue of any kind. It smells nice and fresh too!</li>
    <li> I like the scent of this lotion, i like how it just glides on my skin like butter on bread. I have yet to fully see the effects since i havent finished my first tub. I dont feel hot or warm on those areas where i applied the cream, better yet i feel a cool and colder sensation which i really like. I apply it twice a day.  I am also combining this with my exercise routine so i would have optimum results.</li>
    <li> I feel like it helped with my cellulite it wasnt completely gone but noticeably improved. I also combined use with exercise which is also a great way to gey rid of cellulite. I am currently to lazy to exercise or or use the cream but you may have better luck keeping up. I am currently not motivated to rid myself of cellulite but hopefully in the future that will change. Recieved this free for review.</li>
    <li> Smells good, it&#x27;s not oily. I dnt see any changes yet- only 4 day into the product. I have medium to high hope for this cream.</li>
    <li> Returned had something in it I couldn&#x27;t use.</li>
    <li> What really makes this cream effective is the caffeine and retinol. Yes, I know I have to be careful with retinol during pregnancy it can cause birth defects if it is present in large quantities in the blood stream. Although during breastfeeding the amount that comes from the cream and goes into my body can not go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;And for the soft skin there&#x27;s the cocoa and shea butter. Completely odor-free and it&#x27;s new to me, but good to know that there&#x27;s no fragrances that can cause allergy.</li>
    <li> excellent product. looks super my buttocks.</li>
    <li> Love the texture of cream! Very thick and creamy and smells great!! Makes skin really soft but I don&#x27;t think it reduces cellulite  but  tightens the skin a bit.</li>
    <li> No difference in appearance of cellulite.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using for a few weeks or so. Makes skin very soft. I&#x27;ll continue to use to see if it makes a difference.</li>
