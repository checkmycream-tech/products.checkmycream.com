      <li>I love this.</li>
      <li>So many people have asked me what I was wearing and how to get it.  </li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better.</li>
      <li>so I was glad to find it online.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>it seemed working but needs more time to see results</li>
      <li>Ty :))</li>
      <li>I love this.</li>
      <li>I love meaningful beauty products.</li>
      <li>Okay it</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Feels great on my skin, absorbs quickly, doesn&#x27;t cause break outs, and works great under my makeup for that extra bit of what I like to call that &amp;#34;morning dew&amp;#34</li>
      <li>I originally tried this item through the Cindy Crawford Meaningful Beauty website and really love it.  </li>
      <li>Has a very sweet melon and almost citrus smell.</li>
      <li>I just started using this product,, so far I am happy with it.</li>
      <li>STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS SERUM</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a year or more and it makes my skin soft and feel good.</li>
      <li>Goes on smoothly.</li>
      <li>I have so many cosmetics, however, that I didn&#x27;t want to receive the whole Meaningful Beauty package every month until I use up the cosmetics that I have already purchased.  </li>
      <li>While the Meaningful Beauty Cindy Crawford Glowing Serum did not make my skin glow any more than it normally does, it did temporarily minimize the appearance of pores and fine lines.  </li>
      <li>Not as good as the other Meaningful Beauty products.  </li>
      <li>Helps moisture skin and makes a good compliment to other Meaningful Beauty products.</li>
      <li>Both the consistency and the scent are light, and the latter is both fresh and pleasant.  </li>
      <li>If you have sensitive skin like mine you can&#x27;t use it all the time but every once in a while is nice.</li>
      <li>This product is ok, but I haven&#x27;t seen any real difference in my skin.</li>
      <li>:) I really like it and am going to order more soon :) The only draw back is the price :)</li>
      <li>And it smells so fresh</li>
      <li>Might work better for younger skin, though.  </li>
      <li>I really like this product!</li>
      <li>When I used the last of it I had to order more, which you can&#x27;t order from the website</li>
      <li>This product is great for giving ur skin that extra little something</li>
      <li>The Glowing Serum is not a bad product; it&#x27;s just that there are so many other products, such as Velvety Drops and Olay Total Effects to name a couple, that are better.</li>
      <li>As far as results I would not purchase this product again, but was fun to try.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Honestly it didn&#x27;t really do anything.. like at all.</li>
      <li>I then apply a moisturizer &amp; sunscreen &amp; I&#x27;m ready to go.</li>
      <li>and it really does make your skin glow.</li>
      <li>Also, I have sensitive skin, and this is the only Meaningful Beauty product that irritates my face.</li>
      <li>I receive the kit every other month, but the glowing serum I have only received once and loved it.</li>
      <li>It is delicate and smells nice.  </li>
      <li>And your face gets that nice little extra glow</li>
      <li>I found that it made my skin dull and the products I use like Loreal are much better for your face</li>
      <li>It is light, not oily &amp; takes a few minutes to sink into my skin.</li>
      <li>skin is extremely sensitive.  </li>
      <li>It makes my face so soft.</li>
      <li>It look&#x27;s natural and give me a health look.</li>
      <li>In addition, I am almost 60, so I am dealing with some major wrinkles.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I expected!</li>
      <li>This product left my skin feeling soft and well moisturized.</li>
      <li>I have been having a Thyroid issue which makes my skin extremely dry and this product has made my skin very soft with no break outs.</li>
      <li>I got a small pimple right where Cindy Crawford has her mole after using this product</li>
      <li>Use a small bit on your cheek bones for an amazing subtle allure.</li>

<li> It gives it a little glow, and I feel moisturized all day, which is essential, since I live in a very dry climate.  </li>
<li> Like results, have been using for a long time</li>
<li> AS I HAVE DRY SKIN</li>
<li> This tiny bottle is not worth the money.</li>
<li> It is really hard to find products that do not aggravate my sensitive skin or give me blackheads but also deal with wrinkles.  </li>
<li> Too harsh for my skin.</li>
<li> Made my skin break out really bad after the first 2 times I used it.</li>
<li> I mean obviously Im not very smart.</li>
<li> There is very little product.  </li>
<li> It was not meaningful.</li>
<li> The smell is not pleasant.  </li>
<li> Maybe I&#x27;m using it wrong.</li>
<li> Cannot go wrong!</li>
<li> I was disappointed and will not buy this product again.</li>
<li> Will give it a try but disappointed in price.</li>
<li> I am totally obsessed with this product!!  </li>

I have so many cosmetics, however, that I didn&#x27;t want to receive the whole Meaningful Beauty package every month until I use up the cosmetics that I have already purchased.  I will go back to ordering from them later in the year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glowing serum makes my skin feel wonderful.  It gives it a little glow, and I feel moisturized all day, which is essential, since I live in a very dry climate.  I see a noticeable difference when using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is extremely sensitive.  I have numerous allergies, but I ALSO tend to break out.  In addition, I am almost 60, so I am dealing with some major wrinkles.  It is really hard to find products that do not aggravate my sensitive skin or give me blackheads but also deal with wrinkles.  This item is perfect for all of my issues.  I love it.</li>

    <li> This product left my skin feeling soft and well moisturized.</li>
    <li> Great price! Exactly what I expected!</li>
    <li> Made my skin break out really bad after the first 2 times I used it. I stopped use and my face cleared up.  It feels greasy too.</li>
    <li> was very pleased with the product</li>
    <li> After washing my face and moisturize I use the Glowing Serum. It look&#x27;s natural and give me a health look. I couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better.</li>
    <li> I love this. It makes my face so soft. It&#x27;s awesome</li>
    <li> It was not meaningful. I dont feel beautiful. And Cindy Crawford is still hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly it didn&#x27;t really do anything.. like at all. Maybe I&#x27;m using it wrong. I mean obviously Im not very smart. You can tell that from this review but its not rocket science.</li>
    <li> It is delicate and smells nice.  I got a small pimple right where Cindy Crawford has her mole after using this product and I found that amusing. There is very little product.  As far as results I would not purchase this product again, but was fun to try.</li>
    <li> Very nice feel to this product and it really does make your skin glow.</li>
    <li> This makes your face glow for hours.  So many people have asked me what I was wearing and how to get it.  Love, love, love it!</li>
