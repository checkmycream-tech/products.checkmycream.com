      <li>and it is good to go.  </li>
      <li>This one is better than most, but not quite the ideal fix.</li>
      <li>LOVE IT!  </li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t get the plate off at the end of the day very easily either.</li>
      <li>Crappy fitting dentures...</li>
      <li>The price is also better at Amazon.</li>
      <li>Fixodent is MUCH better than Poly-grip though.</li>
      <li>The woman I take care of seems to love it.  </li>
      <li>I like polident better.</li>
      <li>Well .. none of this stuff is outstanding ...</li>
      <li>Or is it the dentures that after spending lots of cash, here and there, we have yet to find the ideal fit for big mama.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for a few years and have found it excellent.</li>
      <li>With this way you have double holding power which is nice if you have a nice meal.</li>
      <li>fixodent fresh is exactly what i ordered, cost a lot more than walmart, but was a lot easier to buy from amazon</li>
      <li>It certainly shuts the window in friendly smiles, so when teeth are gone, dentures must be.</li>
      <li>Once a day with very minimum application</li>

      <li>She is not easily impressed, so i take it as a good sign for the products effectiveness.  </li>
      <li>The product is exactly as described and works as expected.</li>
      <li>It has a slight fresh mint taste, and holds throughout the day.</li>
      <li>As someone who has witnessed for far too long the minuses of wearing dentures, and the constant struggle for them to stay in place, I have yet to find one adhesive that can fulfill that tall order.</li>

<li> However i spread a thin layer over whole ridge and palette and let dentyres sit for 5  Mins before you swish your mouth with water and insert dentures.</li>
<li> It keeps my partial in place all day.</li>
<li> I also gave applied a thin layer and sprized with a spray bottle and then put layer of the fixodent powder, sprize very lighly again, let sit for 10 mins and then inserted denture.  </li>
<li> I would recommend this to anyone who needs a little help tightening their teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> Well, life goes on, with or without test, but I do agree that not wearing at least some kind of dentures makes for a very sad image, somewhere between uncared and distasteful.</li>

    <li> Works great- never any problems or defects with Fixodent. Will always use product when needed. Best brand name on the market.</li>
    <li> This is great dental adhesive. It keeps my partial in place all day. The mint really does help keep your mouth feel cleaner.</li>

    <li> My husband says this product contains zinc and irritates his gums. Does not want to purchase again.</li>
    <li> The woman I take care of seems to love it.  She is not easily impressed, so i take it as a good sign for the products effectiveness.  Any questions, please ask...  I will find out.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT ALSO.  ESPECIALLY THE MINT FLAVOR.</li>

    <li> Well .. none of this stuff is outstanding ... but then, neither are dentures.  Fixodent is MUCH better than Poly-grip though.</li>
    <li> Great stuff!!!!  This out of all fixodents seems to work best.

    <li> great product - great price - great seller</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!  Great price and quality.</li>
    <li> All as I would have expected.  No surprises!  Only con is the product is not zinc-free, which for some reason I thought it was.</li>
    <li> Crappy fitting dentures... most excellent tooth goo.</li>
    <li> works well to hold my parcial in place</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a few years and have found it excellent. Once a day with very minimum application and it is good to go.  Each tube lasts for over a month and the price is low.  I would recommend this to anyone who needs a little help tightening their teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest Amazon as the place to buy, as the drugstores do not always carry the one labeled \\&quot;Fresh\\&quot;.  I ordered a few which will last me several months. The price is also better at Amazon.</li>
    <li> Too slimy and gooey. Does not work as well as Polygrip. Slides out from underneath plates.</li>
