      <li>fully satisfied</li>
      <li>There are many uses for this product.</li>
      <li>Today, my product of choice for review is my favorite bubble bath.</li>
      <li>Love the subscription availability.</li>
      <li>I just wish it would be more foaming.</li>
      <li>so I bought it from Amazon, it costs more.</li>
      <li>My precious loves bath times</li>
      <li>The no tears element helps to ensure bath time is enjoyable for everyone.</li>
      <li>My toddlers love bath time and never complain about getting soap in their eyes.</li>
      <li>Love the economy size.  </li>
      <li>great product for the whole family</li>
      <li>This body wash is so gentle and smells great</li>
      <li>This was such a great buy!</li>
      <li>is nice and clean.</li>
      <li>The price is great for the large quantity you get in these huge bottles.</li>
      <li>great deal on my favorite wash soap for my son, hair, skin, body, all jobs done ; no fuzz, no tears, no odd scent, we love it;</li>
      <li>Great soap - gives your baby that &#x27;new baby&#x27; smell each and every time.</li>
      <li>but it is great for adults with sensitive skin too.</li>
      <li>(it&#x27;s great for sensitive skin) -</li>
      <li>Works great for any age with sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin, swim a great deal</li>
      <li>Works great for me and my toddler since we both have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Another plus is that it is alcohol free and is part of the &amp;#34;no more tears&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>These large pump bottles are easy to use and a good value.</li>
      <li>It is so much easy when giving a bath to a toddler.</li>
      <li>I found some in a Wal-Mart that had oatmeal in it and wish I could find the huge pump bottles of it from Amazon.</li>
      <li>second reason and the primary reason I keep this product on hand is that it is a great bubble bath.</li>
      <li>I am a huge fan of Amazon</li>
      <li>The jugs are huge.  </li>
      <li>Why use any Johnson&#x27;s baby item that says tear free?</li>
      <li>Perfectly secure package</li>
      <li>larger grip bottles is a great buy.</li>
      <li>yielder, and very useful for bathing baby</li>
      <li>The price may be cheaper at Costco, but this makes for a very useful addition to your online baby registry also.</li>
      <li>I started with one that had the pump top and just took it for granted until I finished and started a new one without the top...</li>
      <li>We received a bunch of baby washes for our baby shower and I have to say that I never really appreciated how handy the ones with the pump top are!  </li>
      <li>The new Mother liked it.</li>
      <li>You may not believe this, but I also use it regularly to clean my bathtub.</li>
      <li>The two bottles really last and the pump top is great because now the older girls can pump what they need to wash themselves and they feel so grown up.</li>
      <li>The pump works well, but can take a while to return to the original position so you can&#x27;t pump too quickly.</li>
      <li>Many of the perfumed bubble baths can really irritate your skin</li>
      <li>Same J&amp;J I grew up with and loved.</li>
      <li>Johnsons Baby Head to Toe Wash is not only good for babies, it is all I use to wash my face twice a day.</li>
      <li>The original smelled much better and my kids weren&#x27;t allergic to the old one...</li>
      <li>Gentle on baby skin, convenient pump makes it easy to get soap while giving toddler a bath.</li>
      <li>Nice big bottles with easy to use one hand push mechanism.. easy to use while one hand is busy holding baby during bath...</li>
      <li>dont smell like the original brand johnsons baby head to toe wash,Smells funny basically</li>
      <li>the pump feature is great for bathing a little one.</li>
      <li>Also useful for extremities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love the economy size.  My 22 yr.old daughter finds it is the only thing that does not dry her skin out or cause itching.  Love the subscription availability.</li>
    <li> My baby loves the bubbly lather and it doesn&#x27;t bother his eyes.</li>
    <li> Excellent service&lt;br /&gt;Been using  Johnsons baby head to toe wash for years. My babies all clean and smell delicious!</li>
    <li> My precious loves bath times, no tears just enjoying the good smell and water.</li>
    <li> Great soap - gives your baby that &#x27;new baby&#x27; smell each and every time. The price may be cheaper at Costco, but this makes for a very useful addition to your online baby registry also. The handle makes it nice and easy to move this bottle around during bathtime. The pump works well, but can take a while to return to the original position so you can&#x27;t pump too quickly. The &#x27;no more tears&#x27; slogan has proven to be correct as our little guy hasn&#x27;t cried once from getting soap in his eyes.</li>
    <li> This was such a great buy! Their prices beat everyone for the size of the bottle. Shipping was fast also! I would definitely purchase from them in the future!</li>
    <li> I after watching the doctors show they recommend that we wash using this in our hair and all over the body and I do now. I found some in a Wal-Mart that had oatmeal in it and wish I could find the huge pump bottles of it from Amazon. But have not found it. Both me and my grandson have eczema and use this and aveeno stress. We have less tangled hair and softer non itching skin. But wish to find the large oatmeal pump bottles on Amazon.</li>
    <li> These are such huge bottles and last a really long time. And what a great price for the amount you get.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Johnson soap. the pump is very easy to use, and makes bath time even more fun for my little ones.</li>
    <li> It is the new &#x27;Improved Formula&#x27; . We do NOT like it. The original smelled much better and my kids weren&#x27;t allergic to the old one... Boo.</li>
    <li> Who would not love the size and the quality</li>
    <li> I wish it was cruelty free!!</li>
    <li> We purchased this because neither the photo nor description showed this to be the &amp;#34;new and improved formula&amp;#34; which smells totally different than the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; stuff. Turns out - it IS the new and improved stuff! Boooo. Got a refund after requesting one. Will be giving this away or donating it. : (&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A++ for customer service though!</li>
    <li> Loved it, just what I expected!! Perfectly secure package, it was delivered faster than I expected!!!</li>
    <li> The jugs are huge.  It&#x27;s Johnson and Johnson baby wash and there&#x27;s no more tears!  What&#x27;s not to love!</li>
    <li> Awesome deal, always last us for at least 4-6 months a bottle</li>
    <li> Product is good but it&#x27;s pricey ....same quantity Costco is cheap&lt;br /&gt;Buy from Costco 5 star for product n 1star for price</li>
    <li> dont smell like the original brand johnsons baby head to toe wash,Smells funny basically like if they just pourn in water and mixed it .not fully satisfied</li>
    <li> I will not have to baby wash in a while the price was good for it also</li>
    <li> I use this to wash my dog.  It is gentle on her skin and she doesn&#x27;t chew on herself anymore because of dry skin and I can wash her face without hurting her eyes.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this for the packaging design. The pump, plus a handle, makes it much easier to use in the bathtub with a wiggly, slippery toddler. I&#x27;ll keep the bottle and just refill!</li>
    <li> I like how they have reinvented the bottle on these baby washes.  It&#x27;s easier to hold and pour now with the side handle!</li>
    <li> We received a bunch of baby washes for our baby shower and I have to say that I never really appreciated how handy the ones with the pump top are!  I started with one that had the pump top and just took it for granted until I finished and started a new one without the top...I really needed two hands with a traditional bottle and I needed a third to make sure my baby wasnt trying to eat and face plant into the bath water.  After that experience I ordered this two pack and plan to pour all my other bottles into these.&lt;br /&gt;My mother and I have always used Johnsons and Johnsons so I cant really compare the baby wash to any others.</li>
    <li> we use this as shampoo for our dog. works great, smells nice but mild, gets her clean, and is a quarter the coast of &amp;#34;dog&amp;#34; shampoo, which is a joke in my opinion. get this and have your lifetime supply, haha!</li>
    <li> This is the only one that didnt give my son an allergic reaction tried the other brands and i highly recommand this. leaves the skin soft.</li>
    <li> Great product by far&lt;br /&gt;Household Name- Johnson &amp; Johnson&lt;br /&gt;Price was great as well!&lt;br /&gt;We definitely will not need Baby Wash for awhile. And thats was the reason i purchased this.</li>
    <li> johnsons baby head to toe wash larger grip bottles is a great buy. in the stores I&#x27;ve seen one bottle for the price of the both bottles.</li>
    <li> Well, if it were just for bathing the grandbabies, this stuff would last a couple of lifetimes.  I also use it for cleaning a cpap machine.  I just fill a smaller bottle from this, though it does have a pump on it.  Don&#x27;t have to worry about running out for a while.</li>
    <li> I have really sensitive skin and acne problems on my back, and my hair is really soft and thin. And I have been using this for years, I am lazy to get out so I bought it from Amazon, it costs more.</li>
    <li> yielder, and very useful for bathing baby</li>
    <li> My son is 2mths old and we&#x27;ve used not even 1/4th of the 1st bottle! These will probably last me a year!!</li>
    <li> I am a single adult but I just prefer a gentle wholesome soap for washing my hair especially.  This fits the bill.  I have 2 bathrooms so this set of 2 pump bottles was GREAT!  Would definitely order again from this vendor!</li>
    <li> The cost per ounce is the lowest in this size.  The pump is nice and convenient and dispenses about a teaspoon of shampoo at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first you would think over 66 ounces of baby bodywash would last forever on a baby/toddler, but it&#x27;s amazing how fast we go through it.</li>
    <li> If your baby is dirty and needs to be cleaned from head to toe this is the product for you. Johnson&#x27;s is the undisputed heavy weight title holder in baby cleaning products. This is the behemoth sized version of their head to toe baby wash. It is great for our son who has super sensitive skin and leaves a very nice scent when he is done with bath time.</li>
    <li> Works great for any age with sensitive skin</li>
    <li> Excellent price, well wrapped, excellent quality item, arrive on time. It comes in a package of four two sets. very convenient, it last several months. thank you.</li>
    <li> My toddlers love bath time and never complain about getting soap in their eyes. This is a good purchase that will last you at least a good 3 to 4 months (I think it actually lasted longer, but I can&#x27;t remember.)</li>
    <li> Being allergic to a chemical found in some soaps this does the trick for me. I also put in the hand wash dispenser so I can keep my hands away from the chemicals in other soaps. My itching and scratching have lessened so it is a plus for me.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin so I use this Baby Wash in my bath. Buying in these large bottles makes it far less expensive than buying the smaller content bottles in the stores.  I have one of these large bottles by my bathtub all of the time.  it makes nice bubbles and does not cause any reaction on my skin.  My dermatologist made this suggestion to me and it was one of the best pieces of advice she ever gave me.  Many of the perfumed bubble baths can really irritate your skin but I have never had any problems with Johnsons Baby Wash.</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for all the time as I have to take care of my baby through out the day. Baby bath, washing my hands before handling my baby, using it for my self as my baby is used to the soap and knowing that it doesn&#x27;t affect my baby badly.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I have to use baby wash in the lower area because I get UTIs from other washes with strong perfumes in them. I love these bottles because they last a loooong time and if I were to go to a drug store and buy baby wash every time I ran out, id definitely be paying more in the long run than these cost for one purchase.</li>
    <li> Works great for me and my toddler since we both have sensitive skin. Large pump bottles are easy to use and last a while. Great buy.</li>
    <li> My favorite baby shampoo and soap all in one! Also great value!! If you don&#x27;t like using such a big bottle you can always pour it into one of the little ones. Smells good but I feel like the smell isn&#x27;t as strong as I remember but not sure. Still great and didn&#x27;t hurt baby if it goes in their eyes by accident!</li>
    <li> Gave as a shower gift. The new Mother liked it. Tired of making up words for this and other products.</li>
    <li> I like this rather than shower jells.  I have sensitive skin, swim a great deal and it keeps my skin moisturized.  The pump is convenient.  A little product goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Lasts forever. We have 3 under 3 1/2 and I think I&#x27;ve only ordered this twice so far. The two bottles really last and the pump top is great because now the older girls can pump what they need to wash themselves and they feel so grown up. It&#x27;s also nice to have he pump top in lieu of screw on top because sometimes you just don&#x27;t have to hands to do it. The soap is gentle with a nice lather and wonderful scent.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing for my skin! Same ingredients as purpose soap and much cheaper! Great buy!</li>
    <li> Our pediatrician recommended this soap for our newborn...but as others mentioned, I&#x27;ve seen it advertised at Costco for half the price.  I will continue to use this soap (it&#x27;s great for sensitive skin) - but next time will purchase at Costco.</li>
    <li> Thanks everyone for sending me a brand new set of soap! There was no hassle whatsoever. Great customer service!!! Cant wait to purchase again!</li>
    <li> Great product to use in your babies bath to help clean them. The no tears element helps to ensure bath time is enjoyable for everyone. We have used this on our 4 year old daily and plan to use it for our newborn in November.</li>
    <li> Same J&amp;J I grew up with and loved.</li>
    <li> I was happy with the quality of the soap and its size.  I just wish it would be more foaming.</li>
    <li> Purchased this from Amazon and the price was better than most (at the time)... approximately $20 or so.  Come to find out the local Costco sell this for about $10.  Nearly half the price!  What gives?  Its my fault, but thought people should know.</li>
    <li> Good product but cheaper at Sam&#x27;s Club</li>
    <li> Sensitivity and allergy problems are a terrible in our family, so we use this instead of regular soaps. I use it as bubble bath.......it&#x27;s an old standby product for me.</li>
    <li> Used this on my 6 kids and 5 grandkids.  Love the pump - frees up a much needed hand when bathing little ones.</li>
    <li> Why use any Johnson&#x27;s baby item that says tear free? It has quanternium 15 and formaldehyde in it the formaldehyde numbs your babies eyes so they can&#x27;t feel the burn and is cancer causing and you&#x27;re using it on infants?</li>
    <li> Gentle on baby skin, convenient pump makes it easy to get soap while giving toddler a bath. we use it every day!</li>
    <li> very very good product thankyou</li>
    <li> Johnsons baby wash is gentle. Since we use it as hand soap in our house, I like the large double bottle packaging.</li>
    <li> Love this baby wash for my son and can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. But you can buy it from Costco for $9.99. I am a huge fan of Amazon but I have to give it to Costco for this one :-)</li>
    <li> I have a lot of young grandchildren who use this up quickly.  Great size and great shipping.  Will buy this again.</li>
    <li> great deal on my favorite wash soap for my son, hair, skin, body, all jobs done ; no fuzz, no tears, no odd scent, we love it; great product for the whole family</li>
    <li> Best deal (at the time) for baby soap/shampoo</li>
    <li> Baby&#x27;s eyes turned red when I used this not good</li>
    <li> On time and just what it was supposed to be</li>
    <li> Good product. Wonderful service and overall perfect deal. My baby likes it. Would buy again and recommend to others also.</li>
    <li> Aside from my sone using this bottle as a missle in the tub, i found that it didnt stay well in my caddy of this supplies. I will opt to get a smaller size. or maybe refills</li>
    <li> I buy this pretty much exclusively for my kids. Yes kids, not babies. I started using this when they were babies and continue using it for my younger kids. My kids tend to get eczema and this is gentle enough for them, especially in winter when their eczema is at its worst. Getting large bottles like this saves money too.</li>
    <li> I started using this product with my first baby and I would keep buying the small bottles at a local store. Now with our new baby I figured that this will last me for a very long time. It works great and it won&#x27;t sting in the eyes. The price is great for the large quantity you get in these huge bottles.</li>
    <li> With a tiny baby at hand you need the press down to get the shampoo. I like Johnsons products and the smell is nice and clean.</li>
    <li> Product is great. I bought the item because it has a pump. It makes it easier to use for my kids. I just wish the price wasn&#x27;t that high. Costco has it only for $10. I say 5 star for the product and 1 star for the price.</li>
    <li> I love this baby wash.  It is the only baby wash I prefer and will use for my children.  I have been loyal to this brand and type of wash since my first baby was born in 1998 and I have never been disappointed.  The smell is noticeable but soft and not offensive at all.  It only takes a tiny amount, so this quantity (2 pack 33.8 oz bottles) will last for a long long time.  Another plus is that it is alcohol free and is part of the &amp;#34;no more tears&amp;#34; Johnson&#x27;s product line.  It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t get any better than this wash.</li>
    <li> Good baby wash doesn&#x27;t irritate my baby&#x27;s eyes, smells nice and seems to  suite my baby&#x27;s skin. Nice big bottles with easy to use one hand push mechanism.. easy to use while one hand is busy holding baby during bath...</li>
    <li> I paid all that money not for the soap, but for the pump. It is so much easy when giving a bath to a toddler. With toddlers you basically have just one had to operate :) with and the pump comes very handy in these situations!!!</li>
    <li> These large pump bottles are easy to use and a good value. Johnsons Baby Head to Toe Wash is not only good for babies, it is all I use to wash my face twice a day. It is so much more gentler on my skin since other soaps can be harsh and cause my skin to dry out. I also keep a large pump bottle in the shower to use as body soap. I have even used it on my hair, it doesn&#x27;t strip the hair from natural oils.</li>
    <li> I was a big fan with 5 stars, even the fact that,&lt;br /&gt;it dry the skin a little. Now,  because at the time  I ordered, they displayed this, as old type, and&lt;br /&gt;delivered with added and irritative improved&lt;br /&gt;formula, and no availability of old type! For me new one is very irritative, with strong smell!</li>
    <li> Use it for my boys for shampoo and body wash and have had no issues. I&#x27;ve used it myself a couple of times when I was short on shampoo and did notice that there isn&#x27;t much of a sting if it gets into the eyes.</li>
    <li> use this on my dogs where I&#x27;m concerned about getting soap in their eyes.</li>
    <li> Cleanse thoroughly, yet is very gentle on the skin.</li>
    <li> Great deal. It will definitely last a while when my little girl gets here :)</li>
    <li> I bought this to wash my baby&#x27;s head and toes. Also useful for extremities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy this again? Not anytime soon, since there are two of these enourmous jugs to cleanse thine baby. There is only so much surface area that requires cleansing on the aforementioned baby, and this bottle set will be able to cover the equivalent baby surface area of the empire state building.</li>
    <li> Lately, I&#x27;ve been trying to review the top 100 items I buy on a regular basis for my home. Some of these items might be for personal care, cleaning my home, food stuff, office products - whatever strikes my fancy. Today, my product of choice for review is my favorite bubble bath. Yes, I have used Johnson&#x27;s Baby Wash products for several years. After having seven grandkids in close succession, in some cases two per year, I kept this product in the house for their bathing and shampooing. They&#x27;re getting larger but I still keep it on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second reason and the primary reason I keep this product on hand is that it is a great bubble bath. Nothing like soaking in the tub in a bit of Johnson&#x27;s Baby Wash. Relaxing and sweet smelling without the floral or other strong smells often associated with adult body wash or bubble bath products. In a pinch, I have used this product for shampooing my own hair although I prefer actual adult hair shampoo since my hair tends to become stiff with this product. You may not believe this, but I also use it regularly to clean my bathtub. Harsh products don&#x27;t work on the modern bathtubs. So, I either use this baby wash or the Shaklee product you will find in another review. There are many uses for this product.</li>
    <li> super price and fast shipping thank you</li>
    <li> Great product, just with the pump wasn&#x27;t as hard to pump while showering baby.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using this product for the last two years on our little one and I love it.  The product doesn&#x27;t cause tearing and the pump feature is great for bathing a little one.</li>
    <li> my husband is very sensitive and basically every shampoo and body wash on the market causes him some issue. This is perfect for him. no more drying out or burning. yes I know its for babies but it is great for adults with sensitive skin too.</li>
    <li> If you have kids, get this product. Hack if your older and have dry skin problem, get this product. My son is 15 and he still uses the head to toe wash because he has sensitive skin. Someone told us about how they use the soap for the same reason and that person is in their 30&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> It meet my standards but the old brand the new formula is not for my son</li>
    <li> Great Product, this head to toe wash is very gentle and great for babies of all ages</li>
    <li> Much cheaper to buy in this size and online!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, will recommend</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin so this is one of best body washes I can use!!!!! I&#x27;m an adult but I don&#x27;t care. This body wash is so gentle and smells great</li>
    <li> This is a great deal with multiple kids or even a single child. This last a long time. Wife got tired of buying it at the store in the regular size and bought these. At first, I thought why so big and it takes up space. Now I love it and cuts down on recycling with the other sizes. I will defiant es order this again.</li>
