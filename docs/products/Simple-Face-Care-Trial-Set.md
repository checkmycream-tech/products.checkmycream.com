      <li>One of these did, but the rest are nice for me.</li>
      <li>I liked each of the items in this pack except for the moisturizer.</li>

      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m about to buy some more</li>
      <li>I love their products.</li>
      <li>Did the job without drying our my skin, so I  wanted to try a couple more items in the line.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s a couple more bucks there</li>
      <li>and this set has a smaller pack which is perfect for travel</li>
      <li>They did indeed feel refreshing and moisturizing without being abrasive, and I like that they are hypoallergenic.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not my favorite moisturizer</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad that I did.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Absolutely love the face wipes.</li>
      <li>Perfect for travel and can be placed into your carry-on as the product is of the regulation fluid amount.  </li>
      <li>The products themselves smell very nice (not too overpowering, but definitely fresh) and feel great on my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>The price on this trial face care set was good and it was available for quick Prime shipping, so I chose it for those reasons</li>
      <li>The price point is great, particularly if there is a coupon available</li>
      <li>I really like the makeup removal wipes -- they don&#x27;t sting my eyes and do a good job of removing my makeup.</li>
      <li>I love them all and plan on purchasing the full size versions when the samples run out.  </li>
      <li>The moisturizer is fine</li>
      <li>How is this good for your skin and when it clearly has parabens in the ingredients!??</li>
      <li>Love Simply and wanted to try some new products and these are the perfect size for this purpose and also travelling.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of the moisturizer, I was glad when my full size was used up, but again for travel purposes I found this small tube to be perfect.  </li>
      <li>If they had been larger they would have been great.  </li>
      <li>The products are effective and gentle on skin.</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>I was excited to see that I could get these for travel</li>
      <li>These moisturize, clean and sooth all in one.</li>
      <li>Now I can clean myself as I should without breaking out or having my skin chemically burned.</li>
      <li>Simple are good products and do were these.  </li>
      <li>The wipes are amazing, I have used them as my main cleanser since that first sample pack</li>
      <li>Super speedy delivery too.</li>
      <li>They were good at taking off makeup, very gentle, and left my face feeling clean and fresh.  </li>
      <li>I fist got a sample of simple wipes about 2 years ago and really enjoyed them!  </li>
      <li>This is the first product I have ever used that doesn&#x27;t turn my face into a tomato!</li>
      <li>This is a great little sample pack</li>
      <li>This is a great little trial sized set.  </li>
      <li>My skin type is very dry, so the moisturizer might be perfect for someone with a different skin type.</li>
      <li>The facial wash was really, really gentle and thorough, but it&#x27;s the wipes that I love most.</li>
      <li>If you never tired Simple products before then this is a good way to try them out.</li>
      <li>Been using it for a week, so far ok.</li>
      <li>It was nice to be able to try the products in a smaller size to see if the products work without having too much left over if they do not work for your skin.</li>
      <li>Item turns out to work really well, will buy full size set sometime soon.</li>
      <li>Overall I&#x27;d highly recommend this set as it gives you a nice intro to Simple products if you&#x27;ve never tried them, or provides an inexpensive travel size set if like me you&#x27;ve tried and love them already.  </li>
      <li>I love simple products.</li>
      <li>Leaves skin soft and clean feeling</li>
      <li>Just ended up drying my horribly dry skin even more.</li>
      <li>non greasy, not thick and heavy on my skin; good results</li>
      <li>This is a great little set to try out the Simple Face Care Products.  </li>
      <li>Best of all, the wipes didn&#x27;t dry my skin out OR leave behind any kind of filminess like some other wipes</li>
      <li>Really like this product..</li>
      <li>Not only is it sensitive, it also is light and leaves skin feeling fresh.</li>
      <li>Not moisturizes the skin, gently nibbling when applied to the face.</li>
      <li>Very affordable too.</li>
      <li>Then wash is gentle and the moisturizer does not clog my pores.</li>
      <li>, it feels basic, but my face felt clean.</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s definitely a step in the right direction if you value your skin and are aware of the toxins your skin absorbs from products.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The kit comes with facial wash, moisturizer, and facial cleansing wipes, and they were a great size for slipping into my toiletry kit.</li>
      <li>I have used many a moisturizer, but I have had lots of problems mainly with my face turning bright red and irritated...which is worse than having dry skin</li>
      <li>The wipes only come with 7 but the other 2 last a good amount of time.</li>
      <li>I decided to try other products in the line and bought a 4 pack full size set (for about $25) and although the other products were alright, I wish this set had been available back then as I could have saved a lot of money trying before investing in full sized products.  </li>
      <li>I have used Mary Kay for years, but my consultant retired, and I didn&#x27;t feel like finding a new one.</li>
      <li>I have VERY sensitive skin and everything I use</li>
      <li>I now have the regular sizes because I tried this first and they worked well and didn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
      <li>I first tried Simple when I got a sample in a Walmart online order.</li>
      <li>And the first time in my life I found a face wash that actually works for me.</li>
      <li>but cheaper and exactly the same here on amazon.</li>
      <li>It hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin, but I&#x27;ve never really had super sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I have seen a marked improvement in my skin.</li>
      <li>I had to keep refolding it to find a section I could use to completely finish the job.</li>
      <li>I could get the full size of all 3 of these for less at Target.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend to get this because you get the facial wipes, face wash, and face moisturizer.</li>
      <li>They worked well enough, not drying, but just not large enough to really clean off all the makeup.  </li>
      <li>Long story short (too late), I tried the Simple facial lotion, and loved it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not at all the ultimate natural product.</li>
      <li>With that out of the way, I have to say that I really do like the other two items.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not for me at all. Makes my face breakout.</li>
    <li> Awesome size and price! Simple brand rocks!!!</li>
    <li> My mom has very dry skin and when I put this product on her it helps</li>
    <li> not for people with oily skin....</li>
    <li> Really like this product..non greasy, not thick and heavy on my skin; good results</li>
    <li> I have VERY sensitive skin and everything I use I break out or get those little bumps on my face. And the first time in my life I found a face wash that actually works for me.I buy this set all the time from CVS but it&#x27;s a couple more bucks there but cheaper and exactly the same here on amazon. I highly recommend to get this because you get the facial wipes, face wash, and face moisturizer. The wipes only come with 7 but the other 2 last a good amount of time. Buy this rather than separately it&#x27;s a lot cheaper in my opinion.</li>
    <li> These are good products but they may contain sulfates. One of these did, but the rest are nice for me. The face wipes are awesome.</li>
    <li> I purchased the trial set just to see how it worked with my skin. I have combo skin that is very dry but is oily in my T zone. So far so good. I&#x27;m very impressed with the wipes! I also like the lotion because it is thick enough to moisturize well but absorbs well. I like the cleanser, it feels basic, but my face felt clean. I will probably repurchase this line.</li>
    <li> I really like the makeup removal wipes -- they don&#x27;t sting my eyes and do a good job of removing my makeup.</li>
    <li> Just as described.  My son loves this face wash.</li>
    <li> I love simple products. I was excited to see that I could get these for travel and they are TSA compliant. sadly this set is way over priced. I could get the full size of all 3 of these for less at Target. This set is half the size and twice the cost. I read the discription as I would receive 9 item. each individual wipe is counted so instead of 3 sets I got &amp;#34;7&amp;#34; wipes and 2 bottles.&lt;br /&gt;the products are awesome but the price is terrible that&#x27;s why the rating is only 2 stars</li>
    <li> I have been using this set, plus the face scrub that I ordered separately, for the past two weeks. I have seen a marked improvement in my skin. Softer, smoother. My acne is improving. I am happy with the moisturizer, it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy.</li>
    <li> I first tried Simple when I got a sample in a Walmart online order. I have used Mary Kay for years, but my consultant retired, and I didn&#x27;t feel like finding a new one. Long story short (too late), I tried the Simple facial lotion, and loved it. I think the quality is comparable to Mary Kay&#x27;s Anti-Aging line. When my sample of Simple ran out, I tried a Loreal line, and I looked forward to running out of the Loreal, because Simple is so much less expensive. I have since switched to Simple.&lt;br /&gt;When this Simple Trial set was offered as an add-on for $2.79 (Amazon gave me a coupon), I jumped at it! Easily one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made as an impulse buy.</li>
    <li> Not very much of the cream. Not moisturizes the skin, gently nibbling when applied to the face. I&#x27;m not very happy with purchase</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this didn&#x27;t work for me. Just ended up drying my horribly dry skin even more. Disappointed. I thought this might be my HG.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Not only is it sensitive, it also is light and leaves skin feeling fresh. Some cleansers make skin feel tight. A little goes a long way for both wash and lotion. Absolutely love the face wipes. Usually other wipes dry out my skin and require another method to remove eye makeup. These moisturize, clean and sooth all in one. The wipes are quite convenient at the end of a long night. Then in the morning just go back to using the face wash and lotion. Very affordable too.</li>
    <li> I had given up on face care products because myself always ended up irritated and blistered. THANK YOU SIMPLE FACE CARE! Now I can clean myself as I should without breaking out or having my skin chemically burned. Then wash is gentle and the moisturizer does not clog my pores. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m fair skinned and my skin dries out in the Winter months. I have used many a moisturizer, but I have had lots of problems mainly with my face turning bright red and irritated...which is worse than having dry skin so I suffered for years. This is the first product I have ever used that doesn&#x27;t turn my face into a tomato! It doesn&#x27;t have all the additives like other creams and it goes on clean with a little water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not tried the other products in the package yet mainly because I don&#x27;t need them at this time so please take this review just for the moisturizer which is why I bought the sample pack to begin with.</li>
    <li> This is a great little trial sized set.  I fist got a sample of simple wipes about 2 years ago and really enjoyed them!  They were good at taking off makeup, very gentle, and left my face feeling clean and fresh.  I dislike washing my face with regular cleansers unless I&#x27;m in the shower because I tend to douse myself in water when washing them off, no matter how careful I try to be.  I decided to try other products in the line and bought a 4 pack full size set (for about $25) and although the other products were alright, I wish this set had been available back then as I could have saved a lot of money trying before investing in full sized products.  The wipes are amazing, I have used them as my main cleanser since that first sample pack and this set has a smaller pack which is perfect for travel and I would buy the set again just for those.  I&#x27;m not a fan of the moisturizer, I was glad when my full size was used up, but again for travel purposes I found this small tube to be perfect.  It&#x27;s not my favorite moisturizer but it&#x27;s acceptable to use for a few days.  The face wash is nice, I use a full size one in the shower and having this size for travel is a great as well.  Overall I&#x27;d highly recommend this set as it gives you a nice intro to Simple products if you&#x27;ve never tried them, or provides an inexpensive travel size set if like me you&#x27;ve tried and love them already.  The price point is great, particularly if there is a coupon available (both times I&#x27;ve purchased it was less than $3 - a steal in my book!)</li>
    <li> I am a fan of Simple face care. I love their products. I bought it as travel set.</li>
    <li> I liked each of the items in this pack except for the moisturizer. Although it&#x27;s labelled as a &amp;#34;rich&amp;#34; moisturizer, I didn&#x27;t think that it lived up to that. Unlike the other two items in this kit, the moisturizer felt &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34;. After I used it, I wanted to add another moisturizer.  With that out of the way, I have to say that I really do like the other two items. I&#x27;ve used other products from Simple, so I knew about the &amp;#34;purity&amp;#34; factor, which is a big plus. The facial wash was really, really gentle and thorough, but it&#x27;s the wipes that I love most. They actually do what the description claims about removing &amp;#34;water proof&#x27; eye makeup. As thorough as the face wash was, it did leave behind some of my mascara and eyeliner (yes, waterproof), but the wipes took care of them with just one use. Best of all, the wipes didn&#x27;t dry my skin out OR leave behind any kind of filminess like some other wipes will. This is good stuff for a great price. My skin type is very dry, so the moisturizer might be perfect for someone with a different skin type.</li>
    <li> Great products. I have combination to oil skin. The moisturizer has control the T zone oliness.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m gonna order every single one of the three items in this set in a bigger size. Enough said. I loved, love, and know that I will continue to love this brand. It hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin, but I&#x27;ve never really had super sensitive skin. But I like that it doesn&#x27;t have all the chemicals and dyes that other brands have. It&#x27;s not at all the ultimate natural product. But it&#x27;s definitely a step in the right direction if you value your skin and are aware of the toxins your skin absorbs from products.</li>
    <li> Although I only used this product occasionally I have to admit that it performed well during the humid days in Hawaii.  I will continue to use it and condition myself to use it daily.</li>
    <li> Great Products.  I like the face lotions the best.</li>
    <li> I had received a sample of the face wash which I used during a cold snap when my regular product failed me and this was really nice.  Did the job without drying our my skin, so I  wanted to try a couple more items in the line.  The moisturizer is fine but I found the moisturing wipes a little on the small size to do a thourough job.  They worked well enough, not drying, but just not large enough to really clean off all the makeup.  I had to keep refolding it to find a section I could use to completely finish the job. If they had been larger they would have been great.  As they say, two outta three ain&#x27;t bad.</li>
    <li> Wife &amp; teenage daughter tried this trail pack; I actually got it as a filler. Item turns out to work really well, will buy full size set sometime soon.</li>
    <li> This is a great little sample pack</li>
    <li> I typically have a lot of trouble finding personal travel-sized face wash in my local pharmacy, so I turned to Amazon to see what I could find for my latest trip to Peru. The price on this trial face care set was good and it was available for quick Prime shipping, so I chose it for those reasons and I&#x27;m glad that I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit comes with facial wash, moisturizer, and facial cleansing wipes, and they were a great size for slipping into my toiletry kit. The products themselves smell very nice (not too overpowering, but definitely fresh) and feel great on my sensitive skin. They did indeed feel refreshing and moisturizing without being abrasive, and I like that they are hypoallergenic. I had never thought of using facial cleanser wipes before, but I ended up using them a lot to wipe off sunscreen or freshen up when I was on the go and didn&#x27;t necessarily have access to a sink and towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have some leftover from my last trip, but when I need a refill I will plan to buy this kit again. The product is very nice, the size is great for traveling, and the price is great for the amount of product that you get.</li>
    <li> This is a great travel kit. I loved all the pieces when I went on a trip.</li>
    <li> Truly great for your skin! Leaves skin soft and clean feeling</li>
    <li> Perfect for travel and can be placed into your carry-on as the product is of the regulation fluid amount.  You have your cleanser, moisturizer and cleaning cloths.  Plus, the &amp;#34;simple&amp;#34; brand is great!</li>
    <li> This was a nice add on to a gift for this years Holidays. The products are effective and gentle on skin.</li>
    <li> Liked delivered fast only bad thing is that wipes don&#x27;t foam up</li>
    <li> Been using it for a week, so far ok. Don&#x27;t see a difference yet but it feels nice after the face wash.</li>
    <li> This is a great little set to try out the Simple Face Care Products.  I love them all and plan on purchasing the full size versions when the samples run out.  The originals are perfect for traveling -- they meet the TSA requirements for airline travel.</li>
    <li> Not good on my skin. I had breakouts after using</li>
    <li> I loved it and I&#x27;m about to buy some more</li>
    <li> How is this good for your skin and when it clearly has parabens in the ingredients!?? Freakin liars</li>
    <li> If you never tired Simple products before then this is a good way to try them out. They give a nice amount of product in this sample and you will be able to tell how your skin will  react to the line. I love it. I now have the regular sizes because I tried this first and they worked well and didn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
    <li> I liked the products in the trial set and I plan on using these products in the future. It was nice to be able to try the products in a smaller size to see if the products work without having too much left over if they do not work for your skin.</li>
    <li> Simple are good products and do were these.  Smaller than I thought it would be</li>
    <li> Love Simply and wanted to try some new products and these are the perfect size for this purpose and also travelling. Super speedy delivery too.</li>
    <li> Did not really like this product</li>
