      <li>I&#x27;m really happy with this purchase, this is my second bottle of this brush</li>
      <li>the smell is strong, but so is straight alcohol which this mostly consists of, so</li>
      <li>So, I would recommend the product because it does clean them well.    </li>
      <li>I use it maybe once a week to keep things clean.</li>
      <li>I like how this product keeps my brushes clean.</li>
      <li>Also, when you change colors of eye shadow, you need to clean the brushes.  </li>
      <li>you have to spray alot to get your brushes really clean</li>
      <li>lol it becomes a pain in the...this little bottle makes it so easy to clean after each use and be done with it.</li>
      <li>It simply cleans with a tissue and does a good job.  </li>
      <li>other then that this is a great product</li>
      <li>other than that, it works great.</li>
      <li>I can do this rather quickly too.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a fan of this product since it does everything it claims to do and smells nice, unlike many other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>So far so good, no irritation with my sensitive skin and the brush has stayed clean.</li>
      <li>As soon as I opened the box and used the cleaner for the first time, I realized I made the right purchase!</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m not crazy about the fragrance.  </li>
      <li>If you can get past the extremely strong smell then you should be good.</li>
      <li>This product does clean brushes and foundation sponges really well</li>
      <li>It is important to clean brushes to prevent bacteria, especially around the eyes.  </li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>so the product runs out fast!</li>
      <li>Removes almost off of the makeup residue and it smells pretty.</li>
      <li>so I knew exactly what I was getting when I ordered it.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
      <li>Actually it worked better than the MAC cleaner.</li>
      <li>Overall cheap and worth it.</li>
      <li>while this product does work really well and cleans the brushes pretty deep, the smell of the product is SO strong that it&#x27;s almost unbearable in my opinion.</li>
      <li>The only thing I would like is a bigger bottle, because you might go through it quickly if you have as many brushes as I do.</li>
      <li>This brush cleaner worked very well.</li>
      <li>It is fast drying and makes sanitizing a breeze.</li>
      <li>It makes cleaning my make-up brushes much easier.  </li>
      <li>Left my brushes super clean and extra soft, will order again</li>
      <li>And I wanted to make sure that my brush would stay clean and not get \\&quot;gunked up\\&quot; or covered in bacteria and make things worse.</li>
      <li>but I think that&#x27;s only if your very sensitive to smell!!  </li>
      <li>this product works very well, there are only 2 cons i can say about it, one is the smell!!</li>
      <li>It leaves them with just a light fragrance once it has completely dried.</li>
      <li>I have gone through the small one very quickly.  </li>
      <li>But I find that if I just wait a little bit more until the brush is dry, it&#x27;s not a problem.</li>

<li> Works as I had expected.</li>
<li> Tweezerman  Men&#x27;s Shaving Brush]] for wet shaving.</li>
<li> Spritz your brushes and carefully wipe on a paper towel until no makeup shows up.</li>
<li> This product is extremely convenient.</li>
<li> It does have a strong scent, but it&#x27;s not too bad.</li>
<li> No more washing my makeup brushes in the sink and then waiting for days for them to dry.</li>
<li> it also lingers for a few days.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m sorry I never used it before now.  </li>
<li> I have never been disappointed in any of their line.</li>

    <li> you know that I would rather wash dishes than wash all my 60 makeup brushes? lol it becomes a pain in the...this little bottle makes it so easy to clean after each use and be done with it. That way I only wash all the brushes once a month for the sake of it - as I am obsessed with  stuff being clean.</li>
    <li> I purchased the glo minerals make up brush cleaner since I own their brushes and to my surprise it was so easy to just spray the product on the brush and wipe off. I am so pleased to find it works and will order again.</li>
    <li> It cleaned my brushes.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it! The smell is awesome!</li>
    <li> Love it , cleans brushes well</li>
    <li> Works great! Actually it worked better than the MAC cleaner. Left my brushes super clean and extra soft, will order again</li>
    <li> This cleaner is perfect for in between deep cleanings. Spritz your brushes and carefully wipe on a paper towel until no makeup shows up. It also conditions your brushes, from the cheapest to the most expensive. Highly recommend!!</li>

    <li> Works as I had expected.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this purchase, this is my second bottle of this brush cleaner so I knew exactly what I was getting when I ordered it. It has a wonderful fragrance, it can be strong at first but does dissipate once the brushes dry. It leaves them with just a light fragrance once it has completely dried. It is fast drying and makes sanitizing a breeze. I&#x27;m a fan of this product since it does everything it claims to do and smells nice, unlike many other brands I&#x27;ve tried. I will be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> It helps keep my brushes clean!</li>
    <li> Good price and works well.  I would have rated five stars but I&#x27;m not crazy about the fragrance.  Just personal preference. Definitely would purchase again.</li>
    <li> this product works very well, there are only 2 cons i can say about it, one is the smell!! the smell of this product is very overwhelming very strong . its smells like alcohol. you have to spray alot to get your brushes really clean so the product runs out fast! other then that this is a great product</li>
    <li> If you can get past the extremely strong smell then you should be good. This product does clean brushes and foundation sponges really well but the smell is too strong. I just have to wash my brushes and sponge with some face wash after using the brush cleaner so it gets rid of some of the smell. I probably won&#x27;t purchase again once I have used it all.</li>
    <li> Will purchase again, works great!!!</li>
    <li> Very easy to clean the brushes and smells nice.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without this stuff.  My brushes and I are very happy.  ;)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a brush cleaner, so I didn&#x27;t know what to expect.  Now that I have this brush cleaner I&#x27;m sorry I never used it before now.  I try to use it after each application to prolong the life of my makeup brushes. It simply cleans with a tissue and does a good job.  I can do this rather quickly too.  A very satisfied customer.</li>

    <li> This product is convenient and works as advertised. It makes cleaning my make-up brushes much easier.  I will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Does the job but the scent is not so nice.</li>
    <li> I like how this product keeps my brushes clean. It does have a strong scent, but it&#x27;s not too bad. Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased the way this cleans the brushes.  I recommend the larger size. I have gone through the small one very quickly.  It is important to clean brushes to prevent bacteria, especially around the eyes.  Also, when you change colors of eye shadow, you need to clean the brushes.  So, I would recommend the product because it does clean them well.    I do not find the odor offensive in any way.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I purchased this brush cleaner...it does a good job of keeping my makeup brush clean and free of bacteria..Will buy again when needed</li>
    <li> Awesome brush cleaner!</li>
    <li> Seems to work well. It is scented. You spray it on the brush and then just wipe the brush on a tissue. Handy product.</li>
    <li> great way to quickly clean brushes. shampooing them with the special shampoo i have for them is best, but i haven&#x27;t mastered the technique of not smashing my brushes to stringy messes when i do that, so this is a great alternative for how often i actually wear makeup. the smell is strong, but so is straight alcohol which this mostly consists of, so i don&#x27;t mind the fragrance.</li>
    <li> I will be buying this product all the time now! It awesome and really makes a difference with my makeup brushes and I love the smell!</li>
    <li> This product is extremely convenient. No more washing my makeup brushes in the sink and then waiting for days for them to dry. A couple of squirts of this, a swipe with a paper towel, and I&#x27;m done. Glominerals has wowed me yet again! :-)</li>
    <li> Removes almost off of the makeup residue and it smells pretty. Perfect for days when you don&#x27;t have time to wash your brushes in between classes.</li>
    <li> The smell of this is somewhat strong, although pleasant. Seems to do the job. I don&#x27;t use this for makeup brushes, I use this for a [[ASIN:B000G647Y8 Tweezerman  Men&#x27;s Shaving Brush]] for wet shaving. I have sensitive skin which is why I switched to wet shaving a few months back. And I wanted to make sure that my brush would stay clean and not get \\&quot;gunked up\\&quot; or covered in bacteria and make things worse. So far so good, no irritation with my sensitive skin and the brush has stayed clean. Doesn&#x27;t really take much to clean either which is good. I use it maybe once a week to keep things clean. Overall cheap and worth it.</li>
