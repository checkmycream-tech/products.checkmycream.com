    <li> Using just a little, your hair gets shiny and smooth.</li>
    <li> Takes the frizz out of your hair and leaves it smooth and shiny!  My hair has color added and I use a straight iron on it, so after using this product my hair is smooth and soft not dry or brittle.  I have tried other products  that say they leave your hair smooth,but instead are too harsh and dry out your hair.  This product doesn&#x27;t do that!  GREAT PRODUCT!!!  I only wish it cost less!</li>

    <li> I started to exclusively buy organic hair products this year, but I haven&#x27;t found anything that can replace this Redken product!  It gives my hair outrageous shine, and my hair feels wonderful from when I first dry and brush my hair in the morning until I jump into the shower later in the evening.  I swim in a chlorinated pool every other day, so my hair isn&#x27;t in very good condition at all, but this product helps in keeping it manageable.  -starlightjulian.yelp.com</li>

    <li> I love this product.  I have frizz, natural culy/wavy hair. I look like Don King in humid weather without this product.  It is not heavy, leaves hair silky to the touch. Great product. Buy it on line here much cheaper than any other place I&#x27;ve checked.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a product to give you a firm hold, this is not for you. However, if you want a product to smooth your hair and eliminate the frizz we all hate, you will love this.</li>
    <li> Great product. Best alternative to the regular hair gel.</li>
