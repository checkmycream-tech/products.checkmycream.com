<li> so I hope it is not full of chemicals and other things that are not organic.</li>
<li> The beeswax does have a distinct smell but it isn&#x27;t bad.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t have any idea if beeswax is supposed to smell this bad in its raw form, but I don&#x27;t think so at all.</li>
<li> Smelled weird not like beeswax</li>
<li> This beeswax smells so horrible.</li>

    <li> Received the wax promptly. Just what I wanted, thanks</li>
    <li> Very good quality beeswax. I used it for making lotion bars!</li>
    <li> Great stuff at a great price &#x3D; can&#x27;t be beat. The beeswax I got was all a nice uniform, yellow color with a normal beeswax smell. This beeswax was also well wrapped (double bagged) and delivered promptly. I will definitely be buying more from H&amp;B Oils Center.</li>

    <li> Smelled weird not like beeswax</li>
    <li> This beeswax smells so horrible. I read a lot of reviews that said the same, so I tried to buy it from a different company, but somehow still ended up with the same product. I don&#x27;t have any idea if beeswax is supposed to smell this bad in its raw form, but I don&#x27;t think so at all. All the beeswax I&#x27;ve ever smelled did not smell like chemicals. I haven&#x27;t even bothered using it because I just don&#x27;t see how it can be good for my skin when it smells like toxins.</li>
    <li> great product and arrive on time</li>

    <li> Exactly what I needed</li>
    <li> The beeswax does have a distinct smell but it isn&#x27;t bad.  However, this claims to be organic but nowhere on the package is it labeled organic.  Most organic products are proud to be USDA Organic certified  but I don&#x27;t think this product is actually organic. I plan to use this in my homemade sunscreen so I hope it is not full of chemicals and other things that are not organic.</li>
    <li> Great product. Easy to work with.</li>
    <li> Product was as described and arrived on schedule.</li>
