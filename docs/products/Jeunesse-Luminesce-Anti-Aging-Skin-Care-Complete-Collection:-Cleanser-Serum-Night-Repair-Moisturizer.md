### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The best I ever used!</li>
      <li>lol!</li>
      <li>The best products are serum, daycream with retinol and night cream which should be in a pump bottle, not a jar which exposes it to air and fingers.</li>
      <li>AND IT IS AND INCREDIBLE CHANGE</li>
      <li>I had great results from this line.</li>
      <li>I gave this 4 stars because the seller is great.</li>
      <li>I do find it to be a good lotion.</li>
      <li>Hope it good as advertised.</li>
      <li>Chang yet .but will see I kind like it.</li>
      <li>great value quick responce</li>
      <li>but when I did all four of these as the suggested regimen I saw even more noticeable differences.</li>
      <li>I first got the daytime cream but decided to buy the set because it was so amazing!</li>
      <li>Fast delivery and great product.</li>
      <li>great product - fast shipping</li>
      <li>Love Love Love these.</li>
      <li>Love this line of skincare and much cheaper purchasing on Amazon than at retail through a consultant.  </li>
      <li>Not a bad product though.</li>
      <li>One product didn&#x27;t smell right and the seller immediately replaced it with no cost to me.</li>
      <li>I wanted to be fair as far as testing the product, so I waited 30 days prior to posting this.</li>
      <li>My skin feels softer and looks more radiant in spite of me spending the last 10 days or so in about 6 hours of tropical sun minimum.</li>
      <li>After the first bottle did not work I thought I would stop buying it, however I gave it another try as suggested by a friend.  </li>
      <li>I notice results within the first week of using these products.  </li>
      <li>I at first just bought a few&lt;br /&gt;products</li>
      <li>One secret is that the serum and the cream are so good that i don&#x27;t spend on eye cream anymore!</li>
      <li>My skin is already much improved and glowing, My friends are even asking what I&#x27;m using.</li>
      <li>So this time I bought this whole set.  </li>
      <li>Adult Stem Cell is probably the most anti-aging skin care you can buy.&lt;br /&gt;You should buy this from a Jeunesse Global Distributor like I did because there is an expiration date on the box and</li>
      <li>I think it does work better than a lot of more expensive treatment product on wrinkles solely (no lifting or evening skin).</li>
      <li>Highly recommended</li>
      <li>Only skincare that really works for me and fast.  </li>
      <li>I started seeing results very early.</li>
      <li>I never want chance it and buy old cosmetic products.</li>
      <li>havent seen much of a difference bu then again its only been a week....</li>
      <li>You only need a small amount of product, btw. :-)</li>

<li> Have noticed slight improvement.</li>
<li> I have been using this line (including the body cream, antioxidant gel and infiniti tablets) for 2 and a half weeks now and already effects are being observed.</li>

<li> I recommend that you at least try it and see the results for yourself.</li>
<li> There was no guarantee and not refundable, this is not good.  </li>
<li> Overall I am disappointed.</li>

    <li> I have been using this line (including the body cream, antioxidant gel and infiniti tablets) for 2 and a half weeks now and already effects are being observed. My skin feels softer and looks more radiant in spite of me spending the last 10 days or so in about 6 hours of tropical sun minimum. I have used other brands over the last 6 years. Jeunesse has worked the fastest, in terms of visible results. I recommend that you at least try it and see the results for yourself. You won&#x27;t regret your investment.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love these. My skin is already much improved and glowing, My friends are even asking what I&#x27;m using. Yay! I had a small bump on the corner of my mouth for years and it is gone. Also a small dark spot is gone now. Thank You and will keep using this product.</li>
    <li> Stuff stings your eyes. Have noticed slight improvement. The best products are serum, daycream with retinol and night cream which should be in a pump bottle, not a jar which exposes it to air and fingers.</li>
    <li> great value quick responce</li>
    <li> Love this line of skincare and much cheaper purchasing on Amazon than at retail through a consultant.  Only skincare that really works for me and fast.  I notice results within the first week of using these products.  Does not have any awful smell and works great with my combination skin.</li>
    <li> I RECOMENDED EVERYONE TO USE THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE I JUST 3 MONTH USING IT AND IT IS AND INCREDIBLE CHANGE</li>
    <li> Hope it good as advertised.</li>
    <li> I gave this 4 stars because the seller is great. One product didn&#x27;t smell right and the seller immediately replaced it with no cost to me. I wanted to be fair as far as testing the product, so I waited 30 days prior to posting this. I like the product. I see no lifting with this product. I do find it to be a good lotion. Use a moisturizer with this so your skin doesn&#x27;t dry out and give it time, since our skin has a cell turn over rate of about 28 days. I think it does work better than a lot of more expensive treatment product on wrinkles solely (no lifting or evening skin). I do feel it helps with smoothing wrinkles though not the miracle in a bottle I always hope for...lol! Not a bad product though. I am considering reordering when running out of product. You only need a small amount of product, btw. :-)</li>
    <li> I had great results from this line. It is a bit aggressive so if you like to see your skin change then give this a try.  I at first just bought a few&lt;br /&gt;products and like them but when I did all four of these as the suggested regimen I saw even more noticeable differences. Adult Stem Cell is probably the most anti-aging skin care you can buy.&lt;br /&gt;You should buy this from a Jeunesse Global Distributor like I did because there is an expiration date on the box and these might&lt;br /&gt;be dated here on Amazon.  I never want chance it and buy old cosmetic products. I bought my products from&lt;br /&gt;www.sarahantos.jeunesseglobal.com  She explained every product in detail to me because I had issues I wanted treated.&lt;br /&gt;Great customer support and knowledge of product.</li>
    <li> The best I ever used! I started seeing results very early. I first got the daytime cream but decided to buy the set because it was so amazing! It is the only thing I use. One secret is that the serum and the cream are so good that i don&#x27;t spend on eye cream anymore! Highly recommended</li>
    <li> I only used for a month nothing Chang yet .but will see I kind like it.</li>
    <li> After the first bottle did not work I thought I would stop buying it, however I gave it another try as suggested by a friend.  So this time I bought this whole set.  After using this product for one month, again, no change.  I am Asian and have sun spots, and have some lines under my eyes.  This product did not work for me.  It is also expensive and the money could have been put to better use.  There was no guarantee and not refundable, this is not good.  Overall I am disappointed.</li>
    <li> great product - fast shipping</li>
    <li> The serum arrived in a box written in Thai instead of English.  The ingredient list on the box (partially written on one side in English) did not match the ingredient list on the pamphlet included in the box or the ingredient list on the Jeunesse website.  I&#x27;m totally upset.</li>
    <li> havent seen much of a difference bu then again its only been a week.... fingers crossed</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and great product.</li>
