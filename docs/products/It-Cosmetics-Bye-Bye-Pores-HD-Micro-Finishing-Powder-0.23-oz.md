<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This powder is amazing , your pores disappear and with this powder being so silky it does not show on your skin like so many of the other . It was a great find and purchase.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time.  It gives your face an airbrushed look.  Super product!</li>
    <li> did not like this.  would not recommend to anyone.  too heavy and is too white.  did not close pores yuck</li>
    <li> I was hoping this would be the kinda powder ive been looking for. But it is not much different than other powders i have. The powder claims not to go into wrinkles but it does just like all the others. Im sorry I wasted my money on it.</li>
    <li> this product is good either alone or over foundation.  just a little takes away shine and evens out the skin tone.</li>
    <li> Other than being too loose (it spills easily), it&#x27;s a good product.  Impossible to hide wrinkles (I&#x27;m 80), but I&#x27;ll try anything since I work as a volunteer at the local hospital (for 23 years).  Norma</li>
    <li> The BEST setting powder available anywhere! It literally blurs pores! LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff! I use it over all of my liquid foundations (Too Faced, Face Atelier, Elf). The best money can buy. Period.</li>
    <li> I really truly love this product. Hear about it and thought to try it out.  Makeup really stays in place when lightly applied--a little truly goes a long way-- and the effect stays on all day; no need to reapply.  Will be using this one for the summer season to keep my face cool, shine free and dry.  A staple in your morning routine no one should be without. Try it; it will not disappoint!!!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in the pore minimizing. Does go on lightly and I do love how it doesn&#x27;t change the color of your makeup.</li>
    <li> I wore this powder to a class reunion, thinking that it was really going to hide a few wrinkles and pores.  Was I ever surprised by what happened.  It looked ok on me, etc. but when all of the class pictures were developed and sent via e-mail to me and to all of my former classmates, in every photo of me I looked like I had white paste all over my face.  I was very embarrassed.  It seems that I looked natural in person; but in photos the white was totally reflected.  I looked ludicrous in every single photo.  Needless to say, I have not worn that powder since for fear pf being photographed.</li>
    <li> Love this product and found an extra bonus, too -- if you need an extra day before you can shampoo, it&#x27;s an excellent dry shampoo!!!</li>
    <li> Does fill in pores nicely, provides a matte &amp;#34;halo&amp;#34; look to the face. I use a brush to apply, the powder is very fine and tends to fly everywhere. Best to use with a stubby bristle kabuki style brush, than with a whispy bristle powder brush.</li>
    <li> Not for me. I looked like I had on a face ask after putting a small amount on.</li>
    <li> Use it daily without any issues.  Has lessened some of the oil on my face.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this powder and take it with me everywhere. The finish is absolutely airbrushed and natural looking.  It truly erases pores, diminishes lines, and eliminates shine.  I replaced BE mineral veil with this powder, it works perfectly with the BE matte foundation and it feels great, never itchy or dry.  It&#x27;s translucent so it doesn&#x27;t change my skin or foundation color, just remember less is more. A little goes a long way, you can build coverage but start out small. One complaint about this order, the powder puff is smaller than the puff that comes with the IT Bye Bye Pores powder from QVC.  Not sure if that&#x27;s bc of this seller or a change IT made, but the powder is still incredible.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see a difference in coverage and dealing with loose powder is too much of a hassle if there is no benefit.</li>
    <li> I have very large pores that have gotten larger as I age.  I&#x27;m 55, and this is the best product I&#x27;ve used to minimize the appearance of my pores!  I have tried everything! I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have quite a few HD powders.  I have rosacea skin, so it&#x27;s extremely sensitive.  I was really hoping to fall in love with the It Cosmetics Bye Bye Pores HD Micro Finishing Loose Powder and I am on the fence.  It does blur the pores, it does a real nice job finishing.  I love the color of it.  It&#x27;s the scent that bothers me and I think bothers my face.  The pot is a good size, but be careful as the product does tend to fly off easily as it is very light in texture.  My only complaint is the scent.  If it did not have the scent it would be almost equal to my favorite HD powder.  I do recommend it highly if you do not have rosacea skin or are bothered by scented products.</li>
    <li> Like it, but price is too high for the quanity</li>
    <li> I really liked the product.  I use it almost every day. This is a product that I will order again.</li>
    <li> does exactly what it says it does pores disappear before your eyes bought another jar a little small for the price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used great finishing powders and even some from Amazon.  But I have to admit, this powder is truly beyond extraordinary.  It *does* minimize large pores, fines lines, and smooths the skin in an amazing way.  I really cannot say I&#x27;ve ever tried anything like it.  For me, the difference between this and other finishing powders is this seems to last much longer.  For people with oily skin, this really does the trick.  So far, this is the best finishing powder that I&#x27;ve tried.  I&#x27;ve used the silica-based powders (MUF), BE mineral veil, even a \\&quot;specialty\\&quot; powder specifically for oily skin that wasn&#x27;t finely milled enough and turned my pores white!  I&#x27;m really quite blown away by the staying power of this product.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I find this powder to be much better than any others I&#x27;ve tried.. it softens your face, doesn&#x27;t look layered or heavy.  .I apply it on in the morning and have reapplied late afternoon and surprisingly it softens my face again.. doesn&#x27;t give that &amp;#34;powdered layered look..&amp;#34; can&#x27;t tell I have powder on. I will buy it again.. I have used this powder with It CC cream and on a bare face &amp; it does great both ways</li>
    <li> While the product is nice, it is the exact same as all the other similar products.  My suggestion is just by the ELF brand as you get far more for less money and the product is literally exactly the same. I have tried several now and they all work the exact same way so that is why I am giving a lower recommendations.  It isn&#x27;t about the way the product works but rather the value for the money.</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t noticed any difference, if anything just makes me look paler as it is a whitish toned powder,maybe I need to blend it with colour?</li>
    <li> I love IT products.  I have oily skin and this micro-powder really makes my complexion look smooth and flawless.  I would recommend this product highly.  It doesn&#x27;t get into the fine lines and wrinkles (if you have them).</li>
    <li> This powder comes with a buff pad but it is said to be good for a brush as well. I put only a small amount on the pad or brush and it still leaves my face looking like someone threw baby powder on me. It is even hard to breath after you apply the powder. Worse yet, after all that it didn&#x27;t even cover my pores and give me a flawless finish as presented. Waste of money :(</li>
    <li> I use it everyday, makes my skin look and feel incredibly soft and helps it look and stay matte. You don&#x27;t need to use much at all either.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time...different from powder as it really does hide the pores. Light, invisible and a good value.</li>
    <li> I love this powder because it has no color and the look is natural and there are no make up lines!  I apply make up once a day and this powder last the day.  The container is small but considering it goes on with a natural look instead of guessing what color to use.</li>
    <li> So far so good. It actually does seem to diminish the appearance of pores.</li>
    <li> a must! I&#x27;ve used this for years on T zone...no more shine. It last a long time. Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Works really well on my skin , have to use sparingly otherwise you have a white face, a little goes a long way, I would recommend.</li>
    <li> makes my huge pores disappear!love it cosmetics!</li>
    <li> Evened my skin tone&lt;br /&gt;Totally minimized pores&lt;br /&gt;Made my skin look smooth and fresh&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product and will order it again</li>
    <li> This powder is so finely milled you wouldn&#x27;t know you had anything on except that you are suddenly poreless and perfect.  Pushing 50 and thought my powder days were over- but this does not settle into fine lines at all.  A little goes a long way. LOVE it!</li>
    <li> I really love this powder.  To my surprise, it actually seems to make some of the wrinkles around my eyes disappear and really smooths out my entire face.  It is the best I have ever used and I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m self conscious about some large pores on my nose, so I was exited to try this product, especially after reading the positive reviews.  Unfortunately for me, instead of masking my pores, I feel like the powder settled into my pores, making them look even more obvious.  I&#x27;ve used it a few times using some different application techniques to see if that would help, but unfortunately it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin allergies to all cosmetic powders,I have tried everything!!!&lt;br /&gt;This is the only powder that doesn&#x27;t contain Talc or Rice Powder or allantoin or any other harmful ingredients!! Unlike any other sephora/makeup product, this is the one powder you won&#x27;t find any of those listed toxins that cause you more breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;Just pure silk powder with other properties that didn&#x27;t cause me any acne, just wonderful AND hypo-allergenic like it says :)&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend for sensitive, acne-prone skin.</li>
    <li> I do write reviews especially when a product deserves to be reviewed.  I have very large pores. I wash, exfoliate and moisture like I am suppose to but the pores remain.  I have tried every tip and trick to minimize the appearance. This stuff is a miracle. I used to fill the pores in to hide them. With this powder I no longer have to.  I&#x27;m not sure how it works but I can testify that it does. I take the of that comes with it and till it across my problem areas.  They all but disappear.  I have tried many other powders that promise these results but this does work.  After I apply this powder my T zone I use a rounded brush blend. I don&#x27;t put it all over in the places that have large pores.  It is a little drying at first but this soon disappears and my skin looks great. Will never use any other powder.  I hope they never discontinue this one!</li>
    <li> Great pic quality but not so great for tanned or darker skin...  I wish I could use it but it ma work for pale skin in photoshoots...</li>
    <li> Best finishing powder I have ever used. It sets my makeup and gives my face a great finish.</li>
    <li> I was so so pleased with this purchase. I admit that I was very skeptical at first as I have tried some products in the past that just made my skin worse, but it really does what it says. I have very oily skin and it helped reduce the shine on my nose and forehead and my pores were much smaller . My skin looked flawless. I would recommend this to anyone. Yes it is pricey but imho it worked for me. I got many compliments on my makeup.You can wear it alone or with your foundation for complete coverage. I&#x27;m going to use IT Cosmetics form now on :) Love it!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I use it everyday after my applying my airbrush makeup. It makes your skin look poreless and helps with oil reduction. I recommend it highly. Use a long brush made for mineral makeup , it works better than a thick blush brush or a kabuki brush.</li>
    <li> This product is just OK.  Not that great. Do not cover all that well. I prefer Bare essentials.  Will not be ordering this product again.</li>
    <li> Great product for oily skin and/or large pores.&lt;br /&gt;Really works well.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My friend is a make up artist and suggested I order this.  It&#x27;s amazing and gives the perfect finish to my face!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  It makes your skin look flawless and the makeup last all day long.  Recommend to all.  Best product I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I am impressed. This powder really looks great and smooth over the It makeup. I usually get shiny by the afternoon, but this keeps the shine away. The makeup leaves me a little sticky and the Silk Micro-powder glides on perfect over it and leaves a smooth finish that seems to make my pores look smaller. I will be ordering more when I run out!!</li>
    <li> I love the finish that it gives. I had to reapply once during the day. I don&#x27;t think that is too bad considering how hot it is where I live. Overall, I was very pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> This is my fav setting and finishing powder by far. It blurs pores and doesn&#x27;t cause that crepy undereye thing; yet, its light as a feather. There is no shimmer, which is what I love. It lasts all day, and holds up in hot weather or under hot lights. Very good quality for the price. A must have.</li>
    <li> It is very light but covers up excellent. My T-zone didn&#x27;t get shiny for about 3 hours. Face was still good after 3 hours.&lt;br /&gt;It will replace my Clinique powder.&lt;br /&gt;Very Good!</li>
    <li> I like it when I first put it on but it does not last a long time.  That is missing in my equation for five stars.</li>
    <li> This &amp;#34;invisible&amp;#34; powder does seem to lighten my makeup.  However, I like it very much as a finishing product and simply apply a bit more blush prior to application to compensate for the lightening effect.  It does leave a very smooth, uniform finish.  I apply it only once because I have never taken the time, much to my mother&#x27;s dismay, to &amp;#34;freshen&amp;#34; my make-up during the day.  This product satisfies my need for all-day coverage.</li>
    <li> Way too cakey, not light, not what i was looking for at all.  Very dissatisfied with this $37 powder! Not worth the price at all!</li>
    <li> It Cosmetics is a very good company to deal with. I like the powder. It goes on the skin very easily.</li>
    <li> Great coverage.  I love how fine the powder is.</li>
    <li> I have tried this product and I absolutely dont like it.  This is definitely not for me, I find better things cheaper at the store.</li>
    <li> This powder is too awesome for words. Make skin look absolutely gorgeous. Works with I closed puff. Or purchase the powder brush..</li>
    <li> I first saw this on qvc earlier this year.  I was really wanting to try it because they said that instead of like most facial powders that feel heavy,  IT is very fine and high definition.  I tried it and loved it!  The only problem I have found is that you cannot use a lot or you will run out!  This is my second small jar.  I&#x27;m going to have to use this one sparingly because it&#x27;s way too expensive to be frivolous with it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product. I don&#x27;t use it as often as I thought I would. But when I do, it does make my skin smoother.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. This didn&#x27;t hide my pores at all, it just sat on my skin all around my pores, highlighting them! And it made my skin feel tight and uncomfortable after I applied it but the coverage wasn&#x27;t great at all and after barely a few hours my skin was shiny (I live in Florida so heat obviously can mess up with make-up, but I usually use Physician&#x27;s Formula and I very rarely feel the need to reapply during the day.) The color is very pale, I have really fair skin and it made me look even paler (geisha look anyone?). It is a very fine powder (think powdered sugar) which is quite messy to use and sticks to itself and to the sink... :-/ I could live with the mess if this product delivered, but sadly it doesn&#x27;t. Or at least not for my skin (I have a sensitive/reactive combination skin).</li>
    <li> Amazing.  Will never buy anything else.</li>
    <li> this really helps set my Neutrongena or Almay CC, after blush and after shadow, I dust my face for healthy and non-Cakey but professional, completed look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do take a dab of coconut oil on a q tip and hit the corners of my mouth as a final touch before lip liner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a kabuki powder brush to dust my face at TJMaxx for cheap!  And that is essential to make this product work.&lt;br /&gt;I looked at cheaper products and glad I didn&#x27;t waste my time or money.&lt;br /&gt; Sometimes packaging counts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is puff that comes with this.  I could almost glue it on the inside of the cap.  Because the puff is useless for application.  But it ensures the powder doesn&#x27;t settle outside the sifter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gives me an adult look... And not the shiny glow of 20 something&#x27;s.  Wow product!  Wish I&#x27;d found it sooner.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried this product, and I think it&#x27;s awesome!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product and all of the It products I&#x27;ve used.  This is my second Bye Bye Pores.  Silky shear finish.  Best I&#x27;ve used.  Got it on Prime too…very quick and easy to order.</li>
    <li> I bought this product not because of any claims about making pores disappear (because I don&#x27;t have that issue), but because the shade of this powder cancels out the red in my face and because the fine-grained silkiness creates a beautifully smooth complexion. It works amazingly well and I absolutely love the effect. However, the fact that it is so fine-grained means I frequently breathe in some of the powder, and I&#x27;m terrified of what I might be inhaling because it&#x27;s made in China, which is not known for the quality control of its ingredients. I continue to look for something to replace this powder, but I haven&#x27;t yet found it.</li>
    <li> I love bye bye under eye, so I gave this a try - product not as great but good as a shine reducer.</li>
    <li> I Love, Love &amp;#34;It Cosmetics Bye Bye Pores HD Silk&amp;#34; It is wonderful. When I&#x27;m in a hurry and don&#x27;t have time t put on all of my makeup I grab Bye Bye Pores HD Silk and it looks like I have put all my makeup on.  It&#x27;s so convenient and looks so fresh. I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else !!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your excellent service&lt;br /&gt;MLP</li>
    <li> I am always hesitant when it comes to powders, they seem to sink into every visible pore or fine line possible. I saw this product on TV and purchased it. Amazing!!! It is so silky, it absolutely hides large pores, doesn&#x27;t get cakey, makes your skin look absolutely flawless. I apply it with the IT Cosmetics Luxe Powder Brush, but you can use any good fluffy powder brush. I even use this on bare skin on days that I don&#x27;t want to use foundation. It&#x27;s also good for your skin as well. Great on all skin tones, from the fairest to the darkest, don&#x27;t let the color in the jar fool you. There is also a bronzing HD powder made by IT Cosmetics if you&#x27;re either very dark or need a good bronzer to warm up the skin. Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> I would love to have given this a five star review,however the powder applicator puff just doesn&#x27;t seem to get inside and fill the larger visible pores as I had expected it to.  Nice feel and texture, using a more sponge type pad seems to work better.  You do have to buff the product in no matter what form of applicator you use.  It&#x27;s ok. I just expected more and easier application.</li>
    <li> Great product! Would not do without</li>
    <li> Talc is bad for us and didn&#x27;t realize! Covers pores for a minute and then they are there again</li>
    <li> This is my new &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; powder. It lasts a long time.  A small amount goes a long way. Shine resistant for hours.  I will be a return customer.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> IT Cosmetics is the best.  This powder is better than all the other high-end finishing powder I&#x27;ve ever tried, and I think I&#x27;ve tried them all.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin, so this product caked a lot on my face. I use it with my moisturizer and it didnt blend well.&lt;br /&gt;Too cakey and kabuki-like finish. I may not know how to apply it properly, but this did not work for me</li>
    <li> Second time I have purchased this product and will probably do so again. I really like it.</li>
    <li> The Best at keeping my face matte</li>
    <li> I do like the fine consistency of the powder but it doesn&#x27;t make pores completely disappear like it claims. Still, it is a nice powder to set under eye concealer with (although I don&#x27;t have pore issues in that area of my face) and I&#x27;m probably getting too old to use any setting powder. For a younger person ( I am turning 40 this year) this would probably be a beautiful pore minimizing setting powder. I don&#x27;t think I will repurchase, however, that is really because of the stage my skin has entered more than it is about the quality of the product.</li>
    <li> i tried this product on the reccomendation from a friend. and WOW--she and the product delivered!! it is fine-milled so there is no cakey look!! it blurrs pores and gives an incredible air-brush finish. and all akin tones can use it!! it is AMAZING!!!!! please try it!! it is now a staple in my beauty bag!! hint--apply it with a fluffy powder brush for flawless application!!</li>
    <li> I use this all the time it kind of feels like I am walking around with an airbrushed look will definitely order again</li>
    <li> I have original product &amp; this is not the same product.  Even a different color product even though says is translucent.&lt;br /&gt;Doubt if it is authentic item!</li>
    <li> Love love love this powder !!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great finishing powder - it does not change the color of my make-up, no skin irritation, and it does minimize my pores (I have large pores and oily / sensitive skin).  It also extends the matte finish -  perhaps two or three hours more.  The major flaw for me with  this product, was realizing it is made in China : ( - thus reducing it to one star.  It is over-priced for being made there and I want to keep my hard earned money in the U.S.  I will not re-order until it is is made in the USA - I will look elsewhere or do without.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this same style of HiTech boots for several years. I am a Consulting Forester, therefore I am frequently in the woods. The boots I wear have to be of good quality &amp; tough since I&#x27;m very rough on whatever is on my feet. These boots provide exactly what I need because they are comfortable &amp; also take a lot of punishment. I also use them for hiking in the Smoky Mountains. Great boot for the price.</li>
    <li> Great Product &amp; Quick delivery</li>
    <li> This powder was great, and IT Cosmetics are supposed to be cruelty-free. I will purchase again!</li>
    <li> The seller I received this item from sent it very quickly--within a week. I really appreciate that. The product was in new condition as stated. I will come back after using it for a while to review it further. So far, it feels very soft on the skin and has done a better job under the eyes than other powders I&#x27;ve used. Not sure if it hides pores that well or lasts very long before having to reapply though.</li>
    <li> I can not say enough about this powder. I use it every day. It delivers exactly what it promises. It make my skin look great and even last in a hot kitchen. Even a pastry chef wants to look good.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the worst!!!!! I didn&#x27;t like the way it felt on my skin and left me very dry.</li>
    <li> I think this is the best finishing powder I have ever used. I so fine you really can&#x27;t see it, but it leaves you skin looking so smooth and perfect!</li>
    <li> It does exactly as it says your pores disappear.It does not add any color to your makeup either very sheer and silky it sets your makeup and you do look flawless. I recommend to all who have large pores and those who don&#x27;t it&#x27;s universal I will buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly as it describes, but it is VERY dusty, and definitely has a silicone type feel if you breathe it in, I just make sure to apply it in a well ventilated area without my clothes on, or else it will get on everything, gaurunteed.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Expensive, but worth it. A little goes a long way, which is good because there is a lot of waste with such a fine powder. My only complaint has to do with the container it comes in. The fine powder gets into&lt;br /&gt;the screw-top grooves, making it impossible to open easily. I have lost more product by spliing it while trying to force the top off than I have used, and that is very frustrating.</li>
    <li> I like the way my skin feels after I apply the powder.  It gives my skin a nice matte finish that stays that way for hours.  The other reviewers were smart in advising to keep some of the paper on the holes and to keep the powder puff.  What they say is true.</li>
    <li> This product does a pretty good job of hiding pores. I use it before and after my foundation. Stays in place and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or chalky.</li>
    <li> Love it, great product, great value. Thank you</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff! Is so awesome and light! No more liquid makeup! IT Pore Minimizer Powder and Bronzer and you can look marvelous too!</li>
    <li> It really has a gud finishing effect. Id recommend it to others. Too expensive though. I am looking to substitute.</li>
    <li> If you want a perfectly matte and poreless finish, this powder will do it for you. I noticed a few reviews complaining about the size of the pot but powder goes such a long way, and this is so fine a powder and you need so little that it should last a long time. I will note that it is so fine that you need to be careful not to breath it in. Handle it so it doesn&#x27;t get in the air in large quantities, it doesn&#x27;t feel good to inhale!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think this would do what it claimed to, but I was wrong...pores are gone...amazing!! So glad I tried it</li>
    <li> I love this powder! It&#x27;s so finely milled it goes on light as air. The results are instantaneous! I used to use BareMinerals Mineral Veil, then switched to Tarte&#x27;s finishing powder... neither were really what I was looking for then they were bought out by companies I don&#x27;t like. So, since I&#x27;m getting older, I thought I&#x27;d try the It Cosmetics line because of the benefits it gives back to your complexion! I haven&#x27;t been disappointed yet in anything I&#x27;ve tried!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the powder because of the color as well... it&#x27;s transluscent &amp; doesn&#x27;t even leave that white cast in pictures. It definitely hides pores &amp; seems to give a nice blur to any other imperfections. There&#x27;s no scent &amp; the little puff in the package is a nice addition. I use the little puff to tap the powder onto my face, then finish blending with their brush. It feels like nothing on the face, but when touching your face? It&#x27;s as soft as silk. It has good shine control, too. I highly recommend the product just because a little goes a long way. I mean a LONG way... I&#x27;ve had it for 6 months so far &amp; you can&#x27;t even tell I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  My skin looks flawless when I put it on after my makeup  and blush.</li>
    <li> It does what it claims to do!</li>
    <li> It mattifys your pores and makes your skin look smooth...Pat this on with your finger..dont use a brush...I didnt like this at first cuz I was using too much. NYX sells 100% silica powder for cheaper though.. this is sorta a rip off cuz its too expensive..but it does work.</li>
    <li> This item is not what I expected it to be. It didn&#x27;t support what it was advertising. I was nothing like it was in the infomercial</li>
    <li> This Bye Bye Pores HD Micro powder was one of my first IT cosmetics purchases. It is also the best purchase I have made. I love this finishing powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You use this powder as a fishing powder, apply your make-up, and then I use this powder on my cheeks, nose and chin. I just sweep across with the accompanying brush, and it leaves a small amount of powder.&lt;br /&gt;This highlights the skin, your cheeks, nose and chin. It is an amazing powder, the shine and shimmer is very natural looking. The powder does not remove make up, but enhances your make up. The shine is of a teenage skin. It is lovely, and I would never leave homecoming without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended. prisron 04-06-15</li>
    <li> Brow pencil worked very well.  Liked the way the brush smoother out the pencil marks.  Foundation brush works great.&lt;br /&gt;Micro-Powder was good, but a bit to white in color.</li>
    <li> This setting powder is amazing. I&#x27;ve tried so many powders that have big promises of reducing the look of pores and fine lines, but none have performed like this powder. The powder is extremely fine and light and after application your skin not only looks flawless but feels so smooth. It controls shine from oil without looking too matte, which can make you look much older and overdone. The other great thing about this powder is that a little goes a long way. You don&#x27;t need to use much to set your whole face. It does come with a little poof but I prefer to tap the powder into the lid ( like you would with a mineral powder) and apply with a fluffy big powder brush. I&#x27;ll use the little poof the go under and around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;The container isn&#x27;t very travel friendly, but one application will last the day without any need for touch ups.&lt;br /&gt;I can definitely say without a doubt that this is my HG setting powder and I don&#x27;t plan on being without it from here on out.</li>
    <li> wonderful light coverage, does what it says it will</li>
    <li> I wanted to give this powder more than 3 stars, but I find it to be just a little too matte.  It does hide your pores and controls oil, but it makes my complexion appear flat and dull.  Someone suggested I try a different brush for application.  I may do that and see if there is any change to how it is applied.</li>
    <li> Light, nice finishing powder.</li>
    <li> Great coverage with this powder, and it doesn&#x27;t change the color of your skin or makeup.  It is a very fine powder, so I have to keep my eyes and mouth closed during application.  It seems to last well - I still have oily skin, and this keeps me looking fresh, not powdered or oily.</li>
    <li> I was shocked to see how small the box was when it arrived. They have the weight wrong on the site. It is .23 ounces NOT 2.4 like it says. That&#x27;s a BIG difference for $24.00 (plus shipping!) You guys need to change this so people know what they&#x27;re really getting. So basically, the Laura Mercier powder that I wanted but didn&#x27;t want to spend the money on is $35 and is 1.0 ounces. Guess what? I would have to buy 4 of these to equal the Laura Mercier powder and that comes out to $96 bucks PLUS shipping! It&#x27;s not even that good either. It&#x27;s really white on your skin. It doesn&#x27;t go on sheer like Laura Mercier and makes it look dry and chalky. I&#x27;m hoping it can be returned.</li>
