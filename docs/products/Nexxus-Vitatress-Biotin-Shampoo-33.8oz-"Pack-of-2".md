      <li>Fabulous product</li>
      <li>This product working pretty good, I like it so much.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> my hair is actually thicker now...i don&#x27;t see scalp, as i used too.  love this product!!!!  the difference is night and day.  i actually feel the same thickness all around when i run my hair through my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m a male, i assume it works for women equally as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i tried many other products and supplements (including rogaine, biotin supplements, brushing my hair more often, cold water on head, various shampoos, etc).  but this one actually worked!</li>
    <li> Best shampoo made for thinning hair.</li>
    <li> It helps my hair remain thicker. Best price in the market.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend not to take shower with hot water and keep the overhead shower pressure to lowest possible. This will avoid losing hair.</li>
    <li> I only use this shampoo.  My hair is curly.</li>
    <li> I use this product because my hair began to thin. It seems to work but only looks about 20% thicker than what I already have.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as it states!</li>
    <li> Lovely, rich shampoo.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo. Instantly gives volume and within 30 days breakage was very little. Less hair in the drain.</li>
    <li> It keeps my hair healthy and a lot less falling out!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best shampoo for thinning hair I have ever used.  The biotin in the shampoo causes my hair to swell giving it a fuller look. It cleans without drying out my hair or my scalp.  If you have thinning hair, you will love this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I DON&#x27;T HAVE HAIR IN THE BOTTOM OF MY SHOWER ANYMORE... I NOTICED AFTER USING THIS SHAMPOO TWO MONTHS THAT MY HAIR FEELS THICKER AND SHINY TOO! I SHARED ONE BOTTLE WITH MY OLDER SISTER WHO IS ON HEAVY MEDICATION FOR PARKINSON AND HER HAIR IS GETTING THIN I THINK THIS WILL REALLY HELP HER....SHE HAS ALWAYS HAD BEAUTIFUL THICK BLACK HAIR.</li>
    <li> I use this shampoo daily, It seems to make my hair healthier and reduce my hair from thinning. Good value when you buy 2.</li>
    <li> Works great for me and my wife it gives your hair more body and we have let our family&#x27;s try it as well.</li>
    <li> What a great way to buy this outstanding product. Hard to find large sizes like this locally.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Amazon and this supplier for making this available and a nice price too.</li>
    <li> I really like how this shampoo builds body into my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only giving 4 star because I have it but haven&#x27;t bused it yet. I usually use bed head or violate but a friend recommended I try this she loves so I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> not sure this really works but the shampoo is ok</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo for years and find it works well for my hair. I think Biotin is essential to healthy hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried different shampoos but always come back to this one.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo... it makes my hair feel so clean and full.  I have used other shampoos but this one is the best. I have been using it since 2002 and just love it.</li>
    <li> Great product. I have been using shampoo for almost a year and I have hair growth along hair line and in thinning spots, too.</li>
    <li> Grows new soft baby like hair; keeps existing hair from falling out. I&#x27;ve been using it for several years, off and on.</li>
    <li> Always use this shampoo.  Very gentle.  Not overly fragrant - but that&#x27;s ok because perfumes are not good for your hair.  My entire family uses this.  I should really do auto-ship on this one.  Its a &amp;#34;keeper.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have used this product, for several years and have founfd that it works beyound my expectations.The product has reduced the hair loss and cleans very well.I highly recommend this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I am male 37 and my hair started falling off. I am using this Shampoo along with Kirkland Minoxidil and in a month, I can see the results. My hair has started to grow again and the bald spot at the back of my head has disappeared. I am using it 4-5 times a week.</li>
    <li> Good stuff and cheaper than other Biotin Shampoo!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely it works for me, I have been using it since 2008, very first day I started using it,my hair stoped falling down, I love it</li>
    <li> I Love this shampoo! I noticed right away only after a few washes how thicker my hair was feeling. Also, is light weight so it leaves my hair bouncy with great volume and a nice healthy shine! I would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> My hair is super dry and damaged due to styling and age.  I bought this product in hopes of getting that salon feeling every day.  It&#x27;s great.  My hair is softer than it&#x27;s been in ages and does not tangle nearly as bad.  I&#x27;m once again able to get a comb through my long curly hair.</li>
    <li> Started using the Nexxus Vitatress Shampoo one month ago, losing hair have definitely decrease.&lt;br /&gt;I also take 10,000 mcg of Biotin gel pills daily. I don&#x27;t know if the combination have done the trick, but I&#x27;m certainly happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo was well packed and received right on time.</li>
    <li> I have used this Nexxus Viatress Biotin Shampoo for many years.  My barber recommended it to me years ago.  He no longer uses this shampoo, but it is the only shampoo I use for my hair care.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t understand why Nexxus does not continue to offer this product to its customers.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a biotin shampoo. It&#x27;ll make your hair look thicker and maybe shinier/healthier. Besides that, it won&#x27;t really help with the hairloss. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year. It&#x27;s selling points are that it is competitively priced and has a good amount of shampoo, which can last quite a while. I gave this a shot, but I think I&#x27;m going to try best seller Pura d&#x27;or now.</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo before and loved it! Mainly because its so mild and leave hair very soft and settled even without a conditioner.. I have curly hair and it just maintains them beautifully.. Very very less frizz in comparison to so many other shampoos i have used in the past.. Since it does not have those super cleaning chemicals i may have to wash my hair every 3rd day in Summers but i would rather do that than using harsh shampoos with detergent like quality on my hair.. It also Gives bounce and thickness to hair.. I got a pack of two and i will buy more :)</li>
    <li> The only shampoo I&#x27;ve used in 10 years</li>
    <li> Really good stuff !! I have had problems with thinning hair and it has added fullness and body. I&#x27;m starting to see new hair growth in spots where I had lost hair.</li>
    <li> It is making my hair oily which promotes falling of hair! No results</li>
    <li> This nexxus vitatress biotin shampoo is excellent for my type of  hair I was looking a long time ago. This is my favorite  shampoo&lt;br /&gt;thank you very much. Regards</li>
    <li> Been using this for a month so far (although only shampooed with it a 5 or 6 times) and it leaves my hair feeling dry. Unless you have to shampoo a lot, it&#x27;s hard to see how the Biotin in this will be of any real effect.</li>
    <li> This product added body to my hair, which is fine texture, and is more manageable.  When I awake in the morning I only run my fingers through my hair and I&#x27;m ready to go.  Fabulous product</li>
    <li> Made my hair extremely dry and fragile. I don&#x27;t recommended.</li>
    <li> This does not work as claimed! I followed the instructions and used it for about a month. Probably lost more hair than when I ever did using any other shampoo. I thought there might be an adjusting period, but I was wrong. : ( In addition, my hair felt rough and my scalp itched. I switched to a natural shampoo afterwards and have not had any issue since. It&#x27;s disgusting that companies like this continue to take advantage of people who are desperate enough to purchase their products and lure in consumers by paying people to write fake reviews.</li>
    <li> Great product. ..nothing better on the market</li>
    <li> The two bottles elsewhere for a much higher price than I paid. this was a good value for salon quality shampoo.</li>
    <li> works for thinning hair</li>
    <li> love this shampoo, adds body and shine. cleans well. would recommend this also for thin hair. good deal. have been using this for years and still works great.</li>
    <li> love this shampoo. my hair feels thicker fuller and shinier and it smells great. would recommend to all men or women with fine hair. the pump is great so a little goes  a long way.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo.  I had an intestinal problem which caused hair loss.  I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for 7 months along with oral Biotin and have seen my hair restored to almost a normal condition.  I expect it to continue because of all the little new hairs growing.  My first purchase of Nexxus Vitatress Shampoo was in Madison, MS while visiting my daughter but I had trouble finding it in South Carolina after I returned home.</li>
    <li> Good stuff.  Works as it advertises.  I have been looking to place a reorder and find the price is 199.99   Can this be a misprint?</li>
    <li> As expected, shampoo arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo for more than 20 years and I&#x27;m convinced it&#x27;s the reason I&#x27;ve kept the hair I have.  I can only find it online now and have discovered that Nexxus is not going to make it anymore.  Why?!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for decades. Nothing else compares. God help me if Nexxus ever discontinues it. I wish it was still available in a one gallon container.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for 5 years now and love it.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo. Remember that there is no conditioner. That was my mistake :p</li>
    <li> Not sure if helps to regenerate hairs follicles, but definitely I am not loosing hair as much as before. Honestly I am not expecting the magic to happen and my hair to regenerate as it was 20 years ago but this is a decent shampoo.</li>
    <li> This product definitely cut down on my hair loss. I was 3 months postpartum with my child when I started using this. It definitely helped, but my hair is so fine that it just made my scalp super oily.</li>
    <li> An improvement on the thickness of my hair is visible.</li>
    <li> It really makes your hair thicker.</li>
    <li> Impossible to find this shampoo in stores near us, unless we buy from the barber and it is 2x the price! So this was a great find!</li>
    <li> the shampoo is to expensive,,,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for years and consider it one of the best out there. The only draw back of this particular packaging/bottle is that sometime the suction you create by pumping the shampoo out of the bottle will keep the shampoo coming even after you are done. In more then one occasion I have found puddles of Nexxus in my bathtub. That said, I wouldn&#x27;t change it for any other shampoo out there.</li>
    <li> too new to rate fairly but girlfriend sad hair was thicker</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and works well.  Kudos!  And Kudos again!</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo for fine thin hair that I have found so far. Says it cleans your scalp to promote hair growth but I think I need to use it longer to promote the hair growth. Gives your hair lots of body and shine and it feels thicker. My only complaint is both plungers on top were broken so I would request they package better for shipping or put better tops on them they seem to be real cheap.</li>
    <li> So, I am suffering with hair loss right now, and on top of the hair loss, my hair texture has become very dry and brittle and course (think of hay, smh). This has helped to nourish it and keep the strands strong. It has also brought some shine back and made it softer. It has a vitamin smell to it, and is a very gentle formula that lathers nicely. I use this in conjunction with Design Essentials Moisture conditioner (which is amazing for dry hair) and the combination has been working for me. I plan to complement my regimen with Nexxus Emergencee to seal the deal. I will be using this for a long time and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to support and strengthen dry brittle and breaking hair.</li>
    <li> This product working pretty good, I like it so much.  So I really recommend it to everyone who has thinning hair.</li>
    <li> Great product have used it for years.</li>
    <li> I love this nexxus shampoo.  This is my first time trying this shampoo and so far my hair has been softer and shinier than it has been in a long time.  I will definitely be using this as my normal shampoo.</li>
    <li> If my hair stops falling out then it works! We&#x27;ll see:) I also take 5000 mg Biotin tabs that the gal that cuts my hair said to take.</li>
    <li> Excellent to keep sebum deposits away and an overall healthy scalp</li>
    <li> My favorite for many years . Very hard to find anywhere including &amp;#34;beauty  Supply&amp;#34; stores ! And rarely found in the large bottles !</li>
    <li> This product is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It helps my hair to look more alive than earlier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hard to find in stores, only issue is this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Biotin Shampoo for years and it is a wonderful shampoo for fine hair.  it cleans well but doesn&#x27;t take out all the oils needed in hair.  it also pumps up the hair shaft to make hair appear fuller.  I will continue to use to use it as long as it is still available!!</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and when I brush it I feel like it breaks easily.  After using this shampoo my hair feels stronger and thicker.  I don&#x27;t mean thicker as in more hair just that the hair strand feels thicker.</li>
    <li> Happy always order this !!!(:</li>
    <li> I had used this product in1999 after chemo to help new hair growth and never switched. I stocked up when I heard it was discontinued but was almost out when a friend told me it was on amazon. I ordered more because I was going on chemo again and wanted to have plenty when my hair started to come back!!! Thank you for having it!!!!!</li>
    <li> For anyone with hair that is overprocessed and has breakage this shampoo is your answer.  It repairs, gives your hair strength and imparts lots of volume and body.......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller did an OUTSTANDING JOB of packing and shipping this product!!</li>
    <li> I have little to no shedding with this product.</li>
    <li> I had used this product previously and knew that I liked it.</li>
    <li> This is a great price for a product that is difficult to find.  The main ingredient should help with hair loss.</li>
    <li> Made this purchase for my wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI Info:&lt;br /&gt;I have used this same shampoo for many years - over 15 for sure. It is consistent and it works well. Great product. Great price.</li>
    <li> Used two times....it really does work on my thinning hair. My hair is thicker, fuller and shiny.</li>
    <li> It really does thicken your hair. It has no scent and is a little thick/dry but it really does thicken your hair. Make sure to get a great conditioner with it.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!!! It saved my hair and strengthened what i had left before it started growinh again</li>
    <li> best shampoo out there for thinning hair</li>
    <li> i have  been using  this  product  for many moons  now</li>
    <li> Great product that does exactly what it claims!  Will highly recommend to friends and family!  Price is definitely the best around!</li>
    <li> Love the shampoo but it leaked all inside the package this time.</li>
    <li> I received product packet very poorly , it spilled all over the packet instead of two bottle , I got only one because each bottle had only 1/2 of bottle left , I&#x27;m very up setting and disappointed&lt;br /&gt;Sincere&lt;br /&gt;Laddany</li>
    <li> Very good products...</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo.  Makes my hair thicker</li>
    <li> This shampoo feels so luxurious!  Love it, smells nice and lots of lather, my hair feels and looks good.</li>
    <li> Great product. I have some thin hair on the top of my head and i believe that this product does help, while im not sprouting trees, i think it has stopped further loss. I have been  using this product for about 2 years and this seller provides it in a clean package, quickly, and a great price!</li>
    <li> The packaging was very good and better than what I expected.Delivery was very fast and arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product so long ago I cannot remember, and I just finished the first bottle!  33.8oz is a lot of shampoo? Plus the pump allows you to control the amount dispensed. I have used Nexxus products since they were recommended to me by a stylist in 1979, when you could only buy it there, and my hair was down my back and highlighted.  Now it&#x27;s the same product but better pricing and I don&#x27;t think anyone can beat amazon for this product and would never change.  My styles have changed, but any time I&#x27;ve purchased another product I always come back to Nexxus.</li>
