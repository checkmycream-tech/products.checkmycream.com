    <li> I use a lot of gold well products, but I&#x27;m completely disappointed and irritated with these nozzle bottles, and the mousse as well! This is the second product that&#x27;s giving me issues with the nozzle! I just received this root lift in the mail and tried to use it, absolutely ZERO product came out! it foams a bit at the tip but it doesn&#x27;t spray! Is there something I&#x27;m missing or are other people having the same issues with their bottles? I had the same thing happen with the mousse whip when the product was still half full, and had to throw it away! Such a waste of money. I tried the whole running nozzle under hot water, and removing the top and running the little straw under hot water, nothing worked! Now I have to go through the hassle of returning it. Ugh :(</li>
    <li> This is a great product for boosting volume to your hair!  This is the first product I have found that does not weigh now my hair.  LOVE it, LOVE it, LOVE it!!</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all and none of them work for me but Goldwell. I have straight, fine hair with lots of cowlicks and it lies flat on my head making it look like I&#x27;m missing part of my skull!  OK, maybe I&#x27;m exaggerating!  With Goldwell rootlift, my hair retains enough lift to last for 2 - 3 days (amazing!) and keeps it&#x27;s bit of wave which keeps it off my skull and gives me a nice, soft look, which helps my angular features. You will not regret trying this product!  I buy it online and keep it stocked at home and never leave home without it!</li>
