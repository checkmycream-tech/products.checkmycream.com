<li> Really thick and gooey going on, which makes for an uneven application.</li>

    <li> I absolutely love the new CND Vinylux nail polish. The purpose of the polish is that it is supposed to last a week without chipping. I put this to the test and it absolutely does last a week without chipping. I do suggest doing what is recommended though and getting the CND Scrubfresh as well and pre treating the nail with that then apply the polish. I do the ScrubFresh followed by three coats of polish and then the clear coat by CND as well. This seems to work great.  This color is gorgeous!!!!</li>
    <li> Love the colors and does last a little longer than regular nail polish.</li>
    <li> Awesome color and stays on forever!This new vinyl nail color stays on , doesn&#x27;t chip and stays shiny well into 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, it really lasts and doesn&#x27;t destroy your nails! Works while working at hospital and outdoor projects too!</li>
    <li> Not sure if I bought from a knockoff seller, but this isn&#x27;t what I got in the salon. Really thick and gooey going on, which makes for an uneven application. Wish I&#x27;d passed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great summer color!</li>
    <li> Love this color!  Unfortuately, I&#x27;m wondering if this product is not good for my nails. After 2 changes of color 2 wks apart, my beautifully long nails are now stubbles.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS POLISH.  After many years of gel manicures my nails were ruined. A friend told me about Vinylux and I tried it. My nails are starting to get stronger. I know it will take awhile but even the person who does my nails has commented that they are getting stronger.  I only need to get one $10.00 manicure a week and it usually lasts until the next time.  I strongly recommend this product</li>
    <li> I found this color to not be quite as vibrant as pictured, it was more like a nice solid pink with a little pearl sheen, not quite as &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; pink as the picture appears.  I still like the color though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely does stain your nails though.  I highly recommend using a base coat as a barrier.  I definitely will from now on.</li>
    <li> I love this polish.  Stays on for over a week with out a UV light.  It is the only polish I use now. I am allergic to what ever they put in gel polish.  In 5-8 minutes it is dry and rock hard.  My nails are the healthiest they have ever been.</li>
    <li> Pretty color,but chipped after only 2days. Drys fast!</li>
    <li> Been wearing it for a month without touching it up!</li>
    <li> Hot stuff.  Love this color, my favorite.  A happy pretty pink it reminds me of a warm summer day.  Go for it !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Polish lasts well for 9 days with just a touch up.  Well worth it !  Removes easy with regular nail polish remover.  Dry&#x27;s faster than standard polish too.</li>
    <li> I have been waiting for this polish to hit the market! Stays on for 7 days, with only one touch up required. As a registered nurse who constantly washes her hands, that is great!</li>
    <li> This is the longest lasting polish I have ever used.  It stays shiny all week and resists chips.  I can consistently get at least 5 days without chips or wear showing.  Best of all, it is so easy - manicure, set and dried, in just 30 minutes!</li>
    <li> These polishes are OK - but don&#x27;t equal my gel manicure I get at the salon.  Sadly...</li>
    <li> I bought this (and the recommended clear top coat) and liked the color but was not happy with the wear.  It doesn&#x27;t stay on as long as stated.  I found that it peeled off, rather than chipped like &#x27;regular&#x27; polishes.  I found that it started peeling within a couple days and definitely did not last a week.  I also want to point out that I work an office job at a desk and it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m doing dishes or something with my hands in water all day that could possibly affect the polish.</li>
    <li> Pretty color--very bright and love the polish itself. Really lasts.</li>
    <li> last the week as promised</li>
    <li> This is a very pretty pink.  It is not iridescent as it looks in the bottle.  I received many compliments. Wears very well with no chips for over a week.</li>
    <li> Like the color, but didn&#x27;t wear as well as some other colors</li>
