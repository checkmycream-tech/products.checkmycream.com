    <li> One of the best after tan lotions out there.  Definitely moisturizes and extends the tan!!</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s pulmologist suggested this to relieve itching and skin flaking due to extreme edema.  The Doctor gave us the name of Total Immersion, but said he called it the blue stuff.  I stated using it and now even use it on my face.  It&#x27;s awesome.  I&#x27;m recommending it to all my friends. I&#x27;m 69 years old and have been looking for something like this all my adult life.</li>
    <li> just like I saw on line and a big savings over buying at the salon</li>
    <li> Great lotion, smells good, doesn&#x27;t have sunless tanning ingredients in it so it won&#x27;t turn you orange. Cost 1/4 what I would have paid for at a tanning salon or beauty supply store. Extended my tan all summer long!</li>
    <li> This is really a good moisturizer, I live at the beach and use it year arround.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff!</li>
    <li> I used this lotion several years ago and had forgotten how good it is -- whether you have a tan or not.  I was going to the beach this year and wanted a tan, but not dry skin.  I remembered this lotion and it will be the only lotion I use from now on!</li>
    <li> As expected, quality!</li>
    <li> SAME thing happen with the lotion that body wash ! WAS in a bag and one of the tops broke Lotion was every where! It was a Mess! I like All of the things that i orderd.  I wish that the 2 produts that i had trouble with had of happen ,things would be good .! Thank You very much !</li>
    <li> I always love this lotion, not oily or thick but can moisturized skin all day long. Smells good too.excellent if you want too keep you tan longer. It works.</li>
    <li> The order is always right and they always send me samples of tanning lotion and, last time, I got a lip gloss for free.</li>
    <li> A great product.  I use it before tan as well.  A lovely scent, very good for the skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. It&#x27;s a great moisturizer and helps to keep that summer glow . It goes on smooth, is not greasy, and has a pleasant light scent. It&#x27;s what I use year round, not just during the summer months.</li>
    <li> I give the product 5 stars, I&#x27;ve used this product for 10 years as my moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;I give the company Blue Marble that I purchased it from on Amazon  No Stars! Horrible customer service! They shipped my 3 bottles of lotion to me in an ENVELOPE ! Who ships liquids that way? Well, of course 2 of 3 bottles were cracked open and a mess! After 2 days of rude, defensive emails with the shipping co. I finally just gave up &amp; tossed the lotions out! I will order lotion again, just make sure it&#x27;s Not through Blue Marble Co!!!! They get zero stars!</li>
    <li> This product is a wonderful moisturizer especially if you frequent the tanning beds.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good moisturizer after tanning.</li>

    <li> This lotion is the best &amp;#34;all around&amp;#34; lotion I have ever used. It keeps my skin from drying out from the summer sun or the winter dryness. It was a great price with the special deal for buying 3 at one time. Would recommend to my friends and will plan on purchasing again when mine runs out.</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer ever! I use it morning and night! Company got it to me way ahead of date scheduled. Defiantly will order more.</li>
    <li> This lotion really works. It moisturizes and protects your skin. This is great to use after tanning or every day as a moisturizer.</li>

    <li> Best lotion i have found in a long time. I first used it at the tanning bed, and liked it very well but it cost over $20.But found it here on amazon much cheaper.
