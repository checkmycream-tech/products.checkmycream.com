### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I had to discontinue use after 3 treatments You are supposed to use 10 treatments for the product to work perfectly</li>
      <li>Wonderful difference.  </li>
      <li>Timed perfectly.</li>
      <li>and I was so impressed with the results.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s  without a doubt the best vale for money you will find!</li>
      <li>Product was great as promised.</li>
      <li>Great Item.  </li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE my Tanda Pearl!!!</li>
      <li>But it does not do a good job.</li>
      <li>I am seeing great results in whitening &amp; will use the remaining gel with the Walmart mouth guard I fit to MY teeth!</li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>With the Pearl I had no sensitivity and the results were amazing and stayed.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll do the 5th treatment because I honestly don&#x27;t think my teeth could be any whiter.  </li>
      <li>It has a very strong metallic taste and made parts of my gums sore.</li>
      <li>The first one of these I ordered was great.</li>
      <li>This product did not whiten my teeth , so like many others I paid quite alot of money, but have nothing to show for it.</li>
      <li>great system, really whitens your teeth</li>
      <li>This is figuring the $195 for the device with 20 gel tubes then figuring $50 for 8 more gel kits (10 tubes in a kit &#x3D; 5 treatments).  </li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy am I glad I did.</li>
      <li>Glad I did not order the additional tubes of whitening gel.</li>
      <li>I tried to go online to find out where the manufacturing company is located so I could file a report with the Better Business Bureau.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Get more gel if you can.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t do more than one treatment.</li>
      <li>And then, when I removed the device, I was horrified to see  it had bleached part of my gums, which I can&#x27;t imagine is healthy in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll stick to whitening strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have tried so many of the teeth whitening machines out there</li>
      <li>Company should look into better packaging.</li>
      <li>GLAD</li>
      <li>the way many of us did.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m just doing this as a free trial through a promotion.  </li>
      <li>I do love the light and the mouth pice though.</li>
      <li>It was relatively easy to use and the cleanup afterwards was a snap.  </li>
      <li>are all accurate, except for the ones that claim it works.  </li>
      <li>and I saw fantastic results.</li>
      <li>A dentist was offering a free teeth whitening using this product.  </li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s simply a light.  </li>
      <li>The mouth tray is easy to use and clean.</li>
      <li>light you use, does nothing for your teeth.</li>
      <li>It is an ecological nightmare.</li>
      <li>This product is fantastic and I would recommend anyone like me that can&#x27;t give up the wine, chocolate or coffee to try this to boost your smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Quick and easy to use.  </li>
      <li>Quick and easy, yes.</li>
      <li>more impulse buys for me without checking Amazon reviews first.</li>
      <li>I was about 2/3 of the way through the full set of treatments when the mouthpiece device stopped working.</li>
      <li>I saw result after the first day and it was pain free.</li>
      <li>Other people have said it works great, but I just have not seen any results that make it worth $200.00.</li>
      <li>Not unpleasant taste.</li>
      <li>I also experienced some slight sensitivity and discomfort while using the Pearl.</li>
      <li>Easy and fast to use.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s over-all coverage, 5 min sessions &amp; useful tray claim vs. using strips.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny.</li>
      <li>They were very helpful and friendly.  </li>
      <li>This is a perfect example of a company who will profit for as long as they can by claiming amazing lies, and when word finally gets around that they&#x27;re scamming people, they will have made enough money by then to go quietly out of business.  </li>
      <li>I also love the fact that it only takes 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>Can not fail if you try this.</li>
      <li>Over the years, I&#x27;ve attempted to use the whitening strips and have never been satisfied with the results as they never seemed to get between the teeth nor the back of the teeth.  </li>
      <li>I got better results from Crest white strips!</li>
      <li>You have to be consistent using it.</li>
      <li>You have to follow the directions, but after the first treatment I noticed the coffee stains disappearing.</li>
      <li>I have tried many different whitening systems.</li>
      <li>However, my husband did the treatment at the same time as me and was 100% satisfied with his results.  </li>
      <li>Since I love wine and will have coffee occasionally my teeth have been suffering in the whiteness factor for a bit.</li>
      <li>I love it  but had trouble with the first one that I purchased as the orange light</li>
      <li>and this is the first one that REALLY works and doesn&#x27;t bother my teeth.  </li>
      <li>The gel is individually packaged making it easy to dispense without guessing or messes.</li>
      <li>They were good results but didn&#x27;t last long</li>
      <li>I am fairly certain my teeth (age 52) are whiter.</li>
      <li>So much better than I expected.</li>
      <li>but them not knowing, got a very close look.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Tanda apparently wants people to believe that by pressing a switch on a piece of plastic that lights up for about five minutes, it will somehow cause a gel to permeate the enamel on our teeth and bleach them.  </li>
      <li>Even the 5 min time went by too fast</li>
      <li>Not irritating to gums.  </li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t tell that my teeth were much whiter after using it.</li>
      <li>The gel is peroxide based, and does absolutely nothing.  </li>
      <li>it does absolutely nothing.  </li>
      <li>All I can say now is that I&#x27;M VERY</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t see much difference in my teeth ...</li>
      <li>and I cant really see a difference in my teeth.</li>
      <li>I just don&#x27;t like the whitener much.</li>
      <li>The light quit working within the first 2 weeks, but I waited too long to return it.</li>
      <li>and my teeth were sensitive!!!</li>
      <li>I had high hopes that this product would really work, but after trying it, I was very disappointed.&lt;br</li>
      <li>:) so not really worth cost of product plus postage.</li>
      <li>Works as promised and super simple.</li>
      <li>We got this particular teeth whitening kit because it was on sale and was recommended some months ago by Dr. Oz.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve finished my fourth treatment tonight and can honestly say there is absolutely no change whatsoever in the color of my teeth.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried whitening products before and pretty much the same.</li>
      <li>I drink coffee, but not red wine, for what that&#x27;s worth.</li>
      <li>Only comment is that you use up a lot of gel, but it is worth it.</li>
      <li>I thought my teeth did look better after about 5 applications but then found out I can&#x27;t change the dead battery.</li>
      <li>It worked well, but I could never keep the stuff on my teeth for more than a half hour because of the sensitivity; I was even using the sensitive formula.  </li>
      <li>New gel tubes were sent to me though to replace the damaged ones.  </li>
      <li>In only five minutes per day for five days, you get a noticeably whiter smile without looking unnatural or making your teeth sensitive.</li>
      <li>Since this product is so new, no one on the Internet broke down the math for me before I bought, but you really need to in order to understand the true cost.  </li>
      <li>Hiding their incompetent product with some kind of &#x27;ionizing&#x27; gismo</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m also not sure using the time-tray does anything more than just time it for the 5 mins.</li>
      <li>The two positive reviews were obviously plants from the seller.  </li>
      <li>Also their 100% refund states in fine print that they&#x27;ll deduct for any missing product...</li>
      <li>It does bend slightly, but not enough to be comfortable or gentle on your face - and is not custom like a mouthguard would be.</li>
      <li>The Tanda Pearl gave me the least satisfying results.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The plastic/rubber tray was much too firm and cut into the gums. I had to discontinue use after 3 treatments You are supposed to use 10 treatments for the product to work perfectly</li>
    <li> Wonderful difference.  Just wish the \\&quot;touch up\\&quot; kits weren&#x27;t so expensive ($50).  Easy and fast to use. Not unpleasant taste.</li>
    <li> I have used this product, as directed, nearly every day for approximately two weeks.  Regrettably, I do not see a noticeable difference in the whiteness of my teeth; at least not yet.  Perhaps it just takes longer with some people than others, so I haven&#x27;t given up yet, but the results so far have been disappointing.</li>
    <li> You take a big risk buying this product without a satisfaction guarantee, considering the price of it . As another reveiwer mentioned there is no return policy, except if it is broken. This product did not whiten my teeth , so like many others I paid quite alot of money, but have nothing to show for it.</li>
    <li> Since I love wine and will have coffee occasionally my teeth have been suffering in the whiteness factor for a bit. The thought of giving up wine crossed my mind but that wasn&#x27;t an options. I needed something to brighten my teeth without the sensitivity that I have got with tooth paste and strips that promise results. They were good results but didn&#x27;t last long and my teeth were sensitive!!! With the Pearl I had no sensitivity and the results were amazing and stayed. This product is fantastic and I would recommend anyone like me that can&#x27;t give up the wine, chocolate or coffee to try this to boost your smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m buying one for my mother for Mother&#x27;s day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just completed treatment number 4.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll do the 5th treatment because I honestly don&#x27;t think my teeth could be any whiter.  It&#x27;s crazy, I have like movie star white teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 12 years ago, I had a dentist make a mold of my teeth and have been using Opalscene (might have spelled that wrong).  It worked well, but I could never keep the stuff on my teeth for more than a half hour because of the sensitivity; I was even using the sensitive formula.  That&#x27;s not the case with this stuff.  Just as they advertise, it&#x27;s no sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to this is the price.  Let me break it down for you and save you the math of how much it really costs.  This is something to think about because the device has a limited usage of 50 treatments (in other words, it&#x27;s 50 5 minute treatments).  That limited usage, I believe, is due to the battery not be replaceable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One 5 minute treatment &#x3D; $11.90.  So each time you put this in your mouth, it costs you $11.90 assuming you use the entire 50 treatments it is capable of.  This is figuring the $195 for the device with 20 gel tubes then figuring $50 for 8 more gel kits (10 tubes in a kit &#x3D; 5 treatments).  That would be a total of 50 treatments.  You end up spending a total of $595 as long as you use if for the 50 sessions it is capable of.  Since this product is so new, no one on the Internet broke down the math for me before I bought, but you really need to in order to understand the true cost.  Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> Disclaimer, I did not order this from Amazon because Ionic Pearl said it could only be returned if ordered from them. So I ordered it from their website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy am I glad I did. This stuff is awful. I can&#x27;t tell you how it whitens because it burned so badly I couldn&#x27;t do more than one treatment. My mouth, my teeth, my gums all burned. And then, when I removed the device, I was horrified to see  it had bleached part of my gums, which I can&#x27;t imagine is healthy in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll stick to whitening strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve made an unsuccessful phone call and put in an email for a return authorization number, I&#x27;ll update on how long that takes. Also their 100% refund states in fine print that they&#x27;ll deduct for any missing product...wondering if that means they deduct for the two tubes of gel I used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more impulse buys for me without checking Amazon reviews first.</li>
    <li> What a big, expensive disappointment.  My Tanda Pearl worked exactly 7 times, and after that, it was dead.  Neat idea, but poor quality.</li>
    <li> Started to use this for a specific event.  Timed perfectly. After TWO DAYS, the little mouthpiece stopped working.  Waste of time and lots of money.  Customer service will call me in 24 hours.  Already too late.</li>
    <li> this is agreat product whiter teeth and no pain</li>
    <li> I have completed 3 of the five treatments and I cant really see a difference in my teeth. I also experienced some slight sensitivity and discomfort while using the Pearl. It has a very strong metallic taste and made parts of my gums sore. Other people have said it works great, but I just have not seen any results that make it worth $200.00. If there is a difference in my teeth, it is not noticeable, and none of my friends or family have noticed any change either.</li>
    <li> this product is a total waist of money , after the five sessions , the color is exactly the same , nothing changed.&lt;br /&gt;NO ONE MUST BUY THIS PRODUCT .</li>
    <li> This product is a complete rip off. For $100 it did very little as far whitening my teeth. I would not recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> I have tried so many of the teeth whitening machines out there and this is the first one that REALLY works and doesn&#x27;t bother my teeth.  Even my dentist was impressed!!!&lt;br /&gt;LOVE LOVE LOVE my Tanda Pearl!!!</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s up with no battery replacement or ability to charge the unit??  Be aware this is a total waste, with no way to recharge...the green light stopped working after 5 uses...information in directions claims 50 uses??  Don&#x27;t buy this.....</li>
    <li> So far I have used the system 4 times.  I haven&#x27;t seen a change at all and it hurts like hell!!  I used half the whitening product this evening and it was much less sensitive.  I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m just doing this as a free trial through a promotion.  A dentist was offering a free teeth whitening using this product.  I will update my review after the 10th application, but like I said, nothing so far.  A little disappointing!!</li>
    <li> This does what it claims, however it&#x27;s a bit messy and I got the same results with Crest Professional Effects Whitestrips.</li>
    <li> We got this particular teeth whitening kit because it was on sale and was recommended some months ago by Dr. Oz.  We opted to do the 5 day treatment versus the 50 minutes all at one time treatment.  It was relatively easy to use and the cleanup afterwards was a snap.  We definitely noticed a difference in our teeth at the end of the 5 day treatment.  I only gave it 4 stars as I was slightly disappointed that it was not quite the difference I was hoping for.  However, my husband did the treatment at the same time as me and was 100% satisfied with his results.  So it is a personal thing for me and has absolutely nothing to do with the product itself.  My only other issue is that you have to buy the booster kit every two to three months and unless it is on sale could get a bit pricy.</li>
    <li> Quick and easy to use.  Not irritating to gums.  Not quite as much whitening as expected.</li>
    <li> So much better than I expected. You have to follow the directions, but after the first treatment I noticed the coffee stains disappearing.</li>
    <li> I am fairly certain my teeth (age 52) are whiter. The application process is very simple and non offensive. Maybe I need another round? I drink coffee, but not red wine, for what that&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> This teeth whitening product is totally useless. Hiding their incompetent product with some kind of &#x27;ionizing&#x27; gismo it does absolutely nothing.  I used it for over 10 days and it did nothing.&lt;br /&gt;Save your money.</li>
    <li> I bought this in July. The light quit working within the first 2 weeks, but I waited too long to return it.</li>
    <li> This system is not very effective, at all. I was disappointed that I wasted so much money on 2 of these and the booster set.</li>
    <li> Barely a noticeable difference, whatsoever. Would not recommend. It does a better job than the mouthwashes but not nearly good enough to justify the price.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell that my teeth were much whiter after using it. I did one round of treatments. Then I pulled it out a few months later to do a second round and it wouldn&#x27;t even turn on. I&#x27;m going to contact customer service. I&#x27;ll follow up with a review after I talk with them.&lt;br /&gt;Follow up: Customer service advised me that the unit would only power on if it had gel in the trays. So, after spending $40 on gel, the unit still doesn&#x27;t turn on. I sent a message to the rep who responded to my original complaint with no response. I called this morning, Monday, and got an answering service. I tried to go online to find out where the manufacturing company is located so I could file a report with the Better Business Bureau. They are located in Israel!&lt;br /&gt;I could have bought a teeth whitening system from my local tanning bed shop for $30 instead of spending almost $200 on this piece of junk!</li>
    <li> Sadly, I have to agree with mny other reviewers here. I was about 2/3 of the way through the full set of treatments when the mouthpiece device stopped working. My teeth are barely whiter than they were when I started and I have all these gel tubes left over that are of no use to me now. $200 for this???!!!!</li>
    <li> I found the product to be of no value.  No change in appearance.  Used as directed and with no effect.</li>
    <li> I bought this through a professional workshop, and it is worthless...Not only will the light not turn green all the time (if the gel or device are too cold) but it just doesn&#x27;t work to whiten your teeth!!!! I could not ever tell I used it after the entire box of gel was used. I got better results from Crest white strips!</li>
    <li> great system, really whitens your teeth i no time.  I love it  but had trouble with the first one that I purchased as the orange light would not go off.  Returned for another one with no problem</li>
    <li> The first one of these I ordered was great. Ordered another and I am on my second return bc they havent worked. Sad.</li>
    <li> This product does not work plain and simple. Invest in Colgate whitening strips instead which do work. My husband was chosen for one of their before and after photo shoot. He followed the instructions and completed the 5 days. Well I being in the dental field but them not knowing, got a very close look.&lt;br /&gt;Their gel product is not strong enough, and that alone won&#x27;t make your teeth whiter in 5 days. Maybe not even in 30 days.&lt;br /&gt;The light you use, does nothing for your teeth. Its just a gimmick to resemble Zoom whitening.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway its an expensive product that does not really work.&lt;br /&gt;Im writing this review because I saw it being sold at the swapmeet this past weekend and I had to research it to see where their product went. Obviously no where.</li>
    <li> Ordered this product for it&#x27;s over-all coverage, 5 min sessions &amp; useful tray claim vs. using strips. After the 1st use, my gums all along my jawline (away from the teeth) were totally irritated. I figured it was the gel getting everywhere? But, it&#x27;s actually the very uncomfortable tray that is a firm plastic. It does bend slightly, but not enough to be comfortable or gentle on your face - and is not custom like a mouthguard would be. I&#x27;m also not sure using the time-tray does anything more than just time it for the 5 mins. There&#x27;s no light coming from it other than the indicator light. I am seeing great results in whitening &amp; will use the remaining gel with the Walmart mouth guard I fit to MY teeth!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve finished my fourth treatment tonight and can honestly say there is absolutely no change whatsoever in the color of my teeth.  Folks, THIS IS A SCAM.  DON&#x27;T FALL FOR IT. I even saw my dentist for a routine cleaning today and he verified there was no change since he saw me one month ago.  This is a perfect example of a company who will profit for as long as they can by claiming amazing lies, and when word finally gets around that they&#x27;re scamming people, they will have made enough money by then to go quietly out of business.  The sad thing is that the public has absolutely no recourse to get back at organizations like this in order to sue their asses off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this for approximately one hundred dollars through Groupon and I&#x27;ve usually found them to be reliable.  I&#x27;ll be very wary of their offers from now on.  Tanda apparently wants people to believe that by pressing a switch on a piece of plastic that lights up for about five minutes, it will somehow cause a gel to permeate the enamel on our teeth and bleach them.  There is no \\&quot;ionic\\&quot; presence here, it&#x27;s simply a light.  The gel is peroxide based, and does absolutely nothing.  The company has put it all in a sophisticated package and tried to make it look as slick as possible.  It&#x27;s a complete lie and a total waste of your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can tell you the reviews you see here are all accurate, except for the ones that claim it works.  Don&#x27;t fall for this b.s. the way many of us did.</li>
    <li> Product was great as promised. Worked immediately and I saw fantastic results. Would defiantly recommend to others!! A must buy!</li>
    <li> I was reluctant to purchase it because I have used whitening products that have not worked for my teeth that is grayish due to a previous root canal. To my surprise it actually improved the color to match my other teeth which will save me from veneers. I hope it will really last as long as manufacturer states. Only comment is that you use up a lot of gel, but it is worth it.</li>
    <li> Heard of this on dr Oz. Purchased thru Amazon by Angelas Beauty. The product did absolutley NOTHING&lt;br /&gt;for me.Reading the warranty I called Tanda dental and was told there is no warranty because I did not&lt;br /&gt;buy from them.Called Angelas Beauty who was the seller and they will not honor the warranty except if the&lt;br /&gt;product is broken.Feel this should be stated on the warranty and is misleading!&lt;br /&gt;So if you buy .Buy from the Company direct and not from Amazon.$200 down the Drain!&lt;br /&gt;Live and Learn.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different whitening systems. The Tanda Pearl gave me the least satisfying results. Quick and easy, yes. But it does not do a good job. Sorry, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Works as promised and super simple. Can not fail if you try this. Get more gel if you can. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see much difference in my teeth ...I will like to have my money back ...no change in my teeth...</li>
    <li> What a total waste of money!  The two positive reviews were obviously plants from the seller.  After 8 \\&quot;treatments\\&quot;, I could not detect any change in the whiteness of my teeth.  Crest White Strips worked better than this super expensive and totally ineffective product.  Glad I did not order the additional tubes of whitening gel.</li>
    <li> Big waste of money, we bought the unit itself from the wholesale club and refills on amazon.  After using the contents of original purchase and a set of refills it was an entire waste of money.</li>
    <li> I thought my teeth did look better after about 5 applications but then found out I can&#x27;t change the dead battery. Not happy. :) so not really worth cost of product plus postage.</li>
    <li> I love this product! In only five minutes per day for five days, you get a noticeably whiter smile without looking unnatural or making your teeth sensitive. The gel is individually packaged making it easy to dispense without guessing or messes. The mouth tray is easy to use and clean. I will definitely be ordering refills for this product!</li>
    <li> The battery must have be drained. The lights on the device blinked but never stayed on like they were supposed to.</li>
    <li> Over the years, I&#x27;ve attempted to use the whitening strips and have never been satisfied with the results as they never seemed to get between the teeth nor the back of the teeth.  I read some of the negative reviews and was also concerned about this purchase, but, something made me get it anyway.  All I can say now is that I&#x27;M VERY GLAD I DID.  My teeth are already at least 3 shades whiter and I&#x27;m only on the 5th day.  I also love the fact that it only takes 5 minutes.</li>
    <li> Product never worked properly, so I have no idea.  Instructions were poorly written, and incomplete. Had to contact company which took 24 hours to get a return call. They were very helpful and friendly.  Even they did not have complete information.  Have not yet been reimbursed for cost and had to pay for shipping for return product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it whitens my teeth as much as I expected. I have had to use other whitener in it to get my teeth whitened. I do love the light and the mouth pice though. I just don&#x27;t like the whitener much.</li>
    <li> I have tried several teeth whitening products in the past and was very disappointed. I have decided to try tanda pearl and I was so impressed with the results. It&#x27;s  without a doubt the best vale for money you will find! I saw result after the first day and it was pain free. I want to add that my gums are sensitive and it didn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried whitening products before and pretty much the same. They can burn your gums. I always try to be careful but usually it&#x27;s the same problem. You have to be consistent using it.</li>
    <li> This product did remove stains from my teeth.  End results of whitening were not as dramatic however, as using white strips, but it does not harm the enamel, so that is a definite plus.  Only problem I had was the seal of some of the gel tubes was broken when I received the unit, and gel had leaked in the packaging.  New gel tubes were sent to me though to replace the damaged ones.  Company should look into better packaging.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes that this product would really work, but after trying it, I was very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t work at all for me. I believe the gel amount was not sufficient and the tray is not deep enough to reach the bottom of the teeth. Even the 5 min time went by too fast and I believe was not enough.</li>
    <li> Great Item.  Love it.</li>
    <li> con-it didn&#x27;t whiten my teeth at all.&lt;br /&gt;pro- did not make teeth sensitive at all.&lt;br /&gt;pro- gel doesn&#x27;t taste as bad as others</li>
    <li> Tanda is asking you to use this product a few times and then throw it away.  It is expensive, but when the battery is dead, you cannot replace it and Tanda will not repair it.  Rather, they offer a NEW machine for ONLY $99.  It is an ecological nightmare. The battery cannot be removed and thus it cannot be properly recycled.  So, you throw away batteries, as well as plastic in the case and the machine.  What a terrible way to extract money from an unsuspecting public.</li>
