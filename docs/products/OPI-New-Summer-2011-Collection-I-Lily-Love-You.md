      <li>Lily Love You by OPI</li>
      <li>I love this polish.  </li>
      <li>rose-colored sheer with a perfect amount of sparkle!  </li>
      <li>Although, those are quite fabulous in their own rite.  </li>
      <li>I love OPI nail polishes.</li>
      <li>This one I LOVE.</li>
      <li>This color is soo pretty!!!  </li>
      <li>so i am guessing it was pretty good</li>
      <li>and it got it off fine.</li>
      <li>My husband is super glad it does not...</li>
      <li>If you go with two coats it&#x27;s a bright pink with interesting sparkle.</li>
      <li>The nail polish was a great shade of pink.  </li>
      <li>I love this polish on - but don&#x27;t use it much because it&#x27;s so time consuming to remove.</li>
      <li>This color is absolutely gorgeous on top of a hot pink color!</li>
      <li>is a fun,</li>
      <li>This is a french manicure rose color, with sparkles.  </li>
      <li>First off this is NOT a glitter polish, it is a FLAKIE polish, something that has been very hot in Japan for awhile.   </li>
      <li>Your mileage may vary - some people have great like with OPI, I don&#x27;t usually).  </li>
      <li>It takes 2-3 coats in order to really see the full color.  </li>
      <li>Wish wall paint came in this color ;).  </li>
      <li>so i Don&#x27;t eve remember buying this, so evidently my wife did..</li>
      <li>The first photo is the polish by itself.</li>
      <li>The color is soft and more natural looking which makes the glitter stand out.</li>
      <li>love this color, it looks just as the picture looks and it lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>A little more money than I have ever paid of a polish, but it is worth it</li>
      <li>I know that glitter polish tends to be more of a challenge, but I spent 30 minutes with acetone polish and nada...</li>
      <li>The more coats you add, the darker the pink gets.</li>
      <li>Glitter is very shiny.</li>
      <li>One look I absolutely love, is paining my nails black, then 2 coats of this, topped off with Seche Vite quick dry and then adding a matte top coat such as Essie&#x27;s Matte About You.</li>
      <li>The pink is slightly lighter than depicted, but is still a great color.</li>
      <li>I particularly like it when I apply 3 or 4 coats.</li>
      <li>Because of the glitter pieces inside the polish, it has a rough finish but a clear top coat helps with this.  </li>
      <li>The second one is the polish as a top coat on different colors.</li>
      <li>It was a bit pricey but worth the extra money.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a nice subtle sparkle.</li>
      <li>The pink is pretty sheer but a second coat makes it a bit more noticeable.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s almost like a clear, with a pink tint, so it took about 3 coats to really get the color.  </li>
      <li>I painted mine on a Friday night, and by Wednesday morning, all my nails were bare again.</li>

    <li> This is a glitter polish in a gelish rose base, long lasting wear,very shiny.Ideal for a touch of glam in nailart.Love it!!!</li>
    <li> The color is very nice and sparkly for spring and summer.  It&#x27;s also the only OPI polish I&#x27;ve ever seen that doesn&#x27;t chip or peel within 5 minutes of application.  Your mileage may vary - some people have great like with OPI, I don&#x27;t usually).  The fact that it&#x27;s a royal pain to remove is why I gave it a low mark.  I like toe polish to last at least a week, but not to require a divine intervention to get the darned stuff to come off.  I know that glitter polish tends to be more of a challenge, but I spent 30 minutes with acetone polish and nada...may have to bite the bullet and pay a salon to take it off.</li>
    <li> This looks great alone or layered on another color. I saw this online and instantly had to buy it. The pink is pretty sheer but a second coat makes it a bit more noticeable. The color is soft and more natural looking which makes the glitter stand out. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this polish.  The glitters have some flakes and comes on perfect everytime I put it on. I just had to order more. The first photo is the polish by itself. The second one is the polish as a top coat on different colors.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved the color, and the fact that it had sparkles, when I saw this.  I thought a bit of brightness might perk up these dreary winter days.  However, I wasn&#x27;t super impressed.  It&#x27;s almost like a clear, with a pink tint, so it took about 3 coats to really get the color.  It stayed on for about a day, then started peeling off.  And not peeling like oh her nails are chipped peeling, but an entire nail coating would just peel off, so you&#x27;d have about 6 painted, 4 non painted fingers.  I painted mine on a Friday night, and by Wednesday morning, all my nails were bare again.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this sparkling color! It makes me really happy!  Wish wall paint came in this color ;).  My husband is super glad it does not...</li>
    <li> Superbe vernis plein de paillettes !!&lt;br /&gt;Un conseil : regardez sur internet pour voir le rendu car il est très transparent !!!&lt;br /&gt;Différents effets en fonction de la sous-couche !&lt;br /&gt;Délais de livraison plus rapide :)</li>
    <li> love this color, it looks just as the picture looks and it lasts a long time. only downfall is that it is difficult to remove. i used 100% acetone like the salons use and it got it off fine.</li>
    <li> i really am in love i just love the color s omuch and its sparkly and pretty and just soooo flowery love it!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> The nail polish was a great shade of pink.  My daughter loved it!  It was a bit pricey but worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> I Lily Love You by OPI is a fun, rose-colored sheer with a perfect amount of sparkle!  It is not complete-coverage sparkle like the Burlesque line or the full-coverage Winter line OPI released that devoured our nails in mind-blowing glitter! Although, those are quite fabulous in their own rite.  This is a french manicure rose color, with sparkles.  Tame.  Summer-licious!</li>
    <li> This one I LOVE. It&#x27;s actually prettier than on the picture. It&#x27;s transparent pink with thousands of various color sparkles. It great for the toes. I particularly like it when I apply 3 or 4 coats.</li>
    <li> This color is absolutely gorgeous! First off this is NOT a glitter polish, it is a FLAKIE polish, something that has been very hot in Japan for awhile.   Unfortunately not many US companies have produced flakies  yet.  One look I absolutely love, is paining my nails black, then 2 coats of this, topped off with Seche Vite quick dry and then adding a matte top coat such as Essie&#x27;s Matte About You. Changes the colors of the flakes and looks as if you have granite on your nails.   Of course this color layered on top of OPIs own You&#x27;re a Pisa Work is gorgeous too!  I love layering!</li>
    <li> very nice item and person to buy from would definately buy again, love the color it is so pretty love opi nail polish</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this color! If you do one coat it&#x27;s a nice subtle sparkle. If you go with two coats it&#x27;s a bright pink with interesting sparkle. I like how this color isn&#x27;t like most glitter polishes. It&#x27;s like there are little pieces of confetti/foil mixed in. I like using this when I do a French manicure.</li>
    <li> Okay so i Don&#x27;t eve remember buying this, so evidently my wife did.. I didn&#x27;t hear her complain so i am guessing it was pretty good</li>
    <li> This color is excellent. The pink is slightly lighter than depicted, but is still a great color. Most glitter polish is just for a top coat. This you can use without any color underneath. The more coats you add, the darker the pink gets. Glitter is very shiny. Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> The polish in the picture looks a lot stronger than it is.  There are definitely sparkles but it does not come out very pink.</li>
    <li> This color is soo pretty!!!  And the brand OPI speaks for itself.  It takes 2-3 coats in order to really see the full color.  Because of the glitter pieces inside the polish, it has a rough finish but a clear top coat helps with this.  My only complaint is that this polish is hard to remove.</li>
    <li> I love OPI nail polishes. After stumbling across this color on Pinterest I could not find it in stores or on the OPI website, so I came to Amazon and this seller had it! I was so happy. This color is absolutely gorgeous on top of a hot pink color! A little more money than I have ever paid of a polish, but it is worth it and it came packaged so it wouldn&#x27;t break and was sealed tightly, unlike other buyers of nail polishes I&#x27;ve gotten before that had actually leaked. This one came in the mail perfect and pretty!</li>
    <li> I love this polish on - but don&#x27;t use it much because it&#x27;s so time consuming to remove. If you need the perfect shine...this would be your polish!! It&#x27;s a love hate relationship. :) Shipping was excellent - very quick!! Would order again!!</li>
