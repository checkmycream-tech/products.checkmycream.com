### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>wasn&#x27;t impressed with the long-lasting quality.  </li>
      <li>Perfect color for me</li>
      <li>also it&#x27;s perfect for stamping nail art!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My wife loved this product.</li>
      <li>Love it!  </li>
      <li>Nice Color</li>
      <li>This brand is best for a super quick drying manicure.</li>
      <li>Perfect for an old lady.</li>
      <li>The color is good and it dries quickly.</li>
      <li>run is my all-time favorite color.</li>
      <li>I love Sally Hansen nail polish, it&#x27;s affordable,</li>
      <li>Absolutely love Sally Hansen nail polish.</li>
      <li>the colors are lovely and it lasts.</li>
      <li>Plus I use a top coat.</li>
      <li>I love the color -  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful medium-deep, mauvish rose with a cream finish, moderately shiny.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the perfect mix of purple and pink without being mauve.</li>
      <li>not just this one - tends to chip very quickly.</li>
      <li>It also has a smooth application.</li>
      <li>After too many years of buying nailpolishes of supposedly varying quality (based on price), I have concluded that the very nature of nailpolish precludes it from not chipping, smudging, or streaking, from Dollar Store brands to well-known brands and more expansive ones.  </li>
      <li>Since they all chip and will shrink (after all they are on your growing nail) - this nailpolish is great for that - it really dries fast.  </li>
      <li>Dries up quickly and easy to remove.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t</li>
      <li>For the most part, I like this nail polish - it does exactly what it says.</li>
      <li>Great color but does dry just a bit darker than you might expect.</li>
      <li>The polish is very easy to put on and the brush is nice and wide - I find I can do three or four nails before I have to add polish to the brush.</li>
      <li>You only have to apply one coat and your good to go.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good it dries fast because I bout thos for my two year old.</li>
      <li>and it goes on the best I have ever used; only one coat needed and dries instantly!</li>
      <li>it is a very pretty color.</li>
      <li>Keep the wild latest fad colors for night and weekend wear.  </li>
      <li>tried other brands and this is good for its money...</li>
      <li>RIGHT AWAY</li>
      <li>One coat really does provide full coverage, and a manicure lasts 4-5 days before the edges start fraying.</li>
      <li>Drys fast without bubbling, great everyday color</li>
      <li>color was pretty.</li>
      <li>I am at a computer keyboard all day and by the end of the first day of wearing the polish is chipped at the top of each of my nails, by the second day large chunks of nail polish is missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t buy any other kind of nail polish anymore.</li>
      <li>It really does dry fast and the colors that it comes in are amazing.</li>
      <li>For a little sparkle try one of the other shades (one layer of color is usually transparent) and layer of a sparkling color on top - something I did recently with Pumped up Pink (125) on top of the more sedate Rose Run (180) and got a lot of compliments (yes and even from young women who were far from \\&quot;old ladies\\&quot;) and it still looked good (and sweetly sexy) for office wear.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a great nail polish to use when you are in a hurry, for example if you have an important event to attend and you are running late, but don&#x27;t expect it to last more than a few days.</li>
      <li>I really like the color.</li>
      <li>The Pink Blink is so cute.</li>
      <li>It dries so fast there&#x27;s no time for it</li>
      <li>It does dry quickly without any smearing - I am not afraid to touch things after I polish my nails.</li>
      <li>This color is just a little less bright on your nails than in the picture, but it still looks fabulous.</li>
      <li>My favorite colors are Pumped up Pink (125), Rose Run (180), Magenta Motion (330), Fast Fushia, and Flashy Fushia (220).  </li>
      <li>and it does dry quickly</li>
      <li>My favorite so far from the instant dry line.</li>
      <li>As a pale, cool-toned person with pink-porcelain skin, Rose Run is my version of red.</li>
      <li>It is professional looking for day wear.  </li>
      <li>yes it did dry fast but chipped within 2 days.  </li>
      <li>However, I don&#x27;t always have a lot of time to spend giving myself a manicure, so I was eager to try Sally Hansen Insta-Dri Fast Dry Nail Color.</li>
      <li>Unlike other polishes claiming to dry fast like Rimmel brands, this nailpolish really does.  </li>
      <li>Unlike one reviewer (who said this color is boring and for an old lady), I find this color a nice shade of pink that is appropriate for wearing to an office.  </li>

    <li> wasn&#x27;t impressed with the long-lasting quality.  yes it did dry fast but chipped within 2 days.  Would probably not get again.  color was pretty.</li>
    <li> My wife loved this product. Dries up quickly and easy to remove.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t tried other brands and this is good for its money...</li>
    <li> Great color but does dry just a bit darker than you might expect.</li>
    <li> Nice Color and it does dry quickly</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish color and get a lot of compliments on it, but unfortunately, I believe it&#x27;s been discontinued.</li>
    <li> I usually give myself manicures – it is less expensive than going to a manicurist and I prefer the way it looks when I do it myself. However, I don&#x27;t always have a lot of time to spend giving myself a manicure, so I was eager to try Sally Hansen Insta-Dri Fast Dry Nail Color. Unfortunately, I had mixed results. For the most part, I like this nail polish - it does exactly what it says. It does dry quickly without any smearing - I am not afraid to touch things after I polish my nails. I love the color -  it is a very pretty color. The polish is very easy to put on and the brush is nice and wide - I find I can do three or four nails before I have to add polish to the brush. However, I find the polish - all the colors not just this one - tends to chip very quickly. I am at a computer keyboard all day and by the end of the first day of wearing the polish is chipped at the top of each of my nails, by the second day large chunks of nail polish is missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great nail polish to use when you are in a hurry, for example if you have an important event to attend and you are running late, but don&#x27;t expect it to last more than a few days.</li>
    <li> It really does dry fast and the colors that it comes in are amazing. It also has a smooth application. I don&#x27;t buy any other kind of nail polish anymore.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m rating on the color alone because all polish chips after a couple days for me. I really like the color. It&#x27;s certainly not matronly looking. It looks like a deep magenta purple. The shine comes after using two coats so I recommend the second coat. Plus I use a top coat. It&#x27;s the perfect mix of purple and pink without being mauve. My favorite so far from the instant dry line.</li>
    <li> IT CHIPS RIGHT AWAY THIS IS A TERRIBLE NAIL POLISH DONT BUY IT</li>
    <li> I love Sally Hansen nail polish, it&#x27;s affordable, the colors are lovely and it lasts. This color is just a little less bright on your nails than in the picture, but it still looks fabulous.</li>
    <li> This brand is best for a super quick drying manicure. It dries so fast there&#x27;s no time for it to smudge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love using it as a base polish and also it&#x27;s perfect for stamping nail art!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Insta-Dri polish is a creamy, self-leveling polish that is opaque in one coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this to all my friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rose run is my all-time favorite color.</li>
    <li> The very next day it was chipping!! I couldn&#x27;t believe it! I 100% Do NOT recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> After too many years of buying nailpolishes of supposedly varying quality (based on price), I have concluded that the very nature of nailpolish precludes it from not chipping, smudging, or streaking, from Dollar Store brands to well-known brands and more expansive ones.  No one nailpolish has everything.  Since they all chip and will shrink (after all they are on your growing nail) - this nailpolish is great for that - it really dries fast.  Unlike other polishes claiming to dry fast like Rimmel brands, this nailpolish really does.  It is the only nailpolish I buy.

My favorite colors are Pumped up Pink (125), Rose Run (180), Magenta Motion (330), Fast Fushia, and Flashy Fushia (220).  Yes, I tend to like pinky/rose shades.</li>
    <li> As a pale, cool-toned person with pink-porcelain skin, Rose Run is my version of red. It&#x27;s a beautiful medium-deep, mauvish rose with a cream finish, moderately shiny. One coat really does provide full coverage, and a manicure lasts 4-5 days before the edges start fraying. This is one of my favorite nail polish colors, and I am sorry that Sally Hansen discontinued it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good it dries fast because I bout thos for my two year old. But the color is dull. Perfect for an old lady.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love Sally Hansen nail polish. The Pink Blink is so cute. You only have to apply one coat and your good to go.</li>
