      <li>Now my skin is smooth with an even tone.  </li>

      <li>I only wished it smelled good, it really has no smell whatsoever.</li>
      <li>I guess I&#x27;m used to more intense exfoliating masks because this doesn&#x27;t do much at all for me.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; results to ensure it is worth repurchasing.</li>
      <li>Very gentle - overall amazing product.</li>
      <li>Put it on for only a few minutes at a time, I found 3 minutes was best for me.</li>
      <li>used it under my eyes and at first and thought it improved the appearance of the lines under my eyes.  </li>
      <li>- plus, you get a LOT more for a lesser price</li>
      <li>I really, really love this mask - especially after reading her suggestion to use it in the shower or with the herbal steam (</li>
      <li>This is a great mask for highly sensitive skin - you may feel a slight tingle</li>
      <li>I love the product, it takes care of the smaller pimples (like the ones around the nose) and minimizes the large ones (on the cheek).  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used other Papain and Bromelaid products at home and had noticable and effective Results.  </li>
      <li>Given that it does a good job, is gentle enough for sensitive skin, and is reasonably priced, I highly recommend it.</li>

      <li>I used to have congested pores and this has really cleared everything out.  </li>
      <li>highly recommend!</li>
      <li>this mask really seemed to help with that.</li>
      <li>Did not notice really any difference after use</li>
      <li>I really like this product</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take that much to cover your face and neck.</li>
      <li>Gets rid of dead skin and gives you a nice dewy look.</li>
      <li>and I like supporting a smaller, more local company.</li>
      <li>but I liked the look and feel of my face after--not dry or red.  </li>
      <li>After I clean my skin, I apply more than a thin layer on my face at night and sleep with the mask on.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very gentle, and leaves your skin very soft, especially when you use with their Jojoba buff cream cleanser.  </li>
      <li>Leave you face very soft and luminosity.</li>
      <li>My skin is very sensitive when it comes to acids and Vitamin C</li>
      <li>I love this mask, I use it every other morning in the shower and once a week with my facial steamer.  </li>
      <li>I mean, it comes in a cute little box and looks just adorable.</li>
      <li>The amount is too little, more should be packages in a slightly larger container.  </li>
      <li>It looks and feels like putting clear aloe vera gel on my skin and doesn&#x27;t do any type of exfoliating to my skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a clear gel</li>
      <li>I will continue to buy and use this mask, my husband uses it as well for his sensitive skin, once a week and has noticed a difference.</li>
      <li>and I have sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 52 years old and was battling chin acne.  </li>
      <li>My skin is smooth, soft &amp; less oily for several days.&lt;br</li>
      <li>There are other brands I like better, is what it comes down to.</li>
      <li>No tingling, no super fresh feeling, no tightened pores...</li>
      <li>Or a younger person in their teens or 20s who wants to carefully dry oily skin or breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have no negative side effects and occasionally experience minor tingling.  </li>
      <li>If you do buy it, I recommend using it at full strength instead of watering it down by applying it to a wet face, like the instructions say to.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> For the above reason, I gave it a 5 star. I have been use different enzyme product and this is the best.</li>
    <li> My skin color becomes bright after using this product. Feels so refreshing.</li>
    <li> I really like this product</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of enzymes masks, and wanted to love this one. However, I just can&#x27;t say that I do. It&#x27;s o.k., and I&#x27;ll use it up, but I won&#x27;t be buying it again. There are other brands I like better, is what it comes down to. If you do buy it, I recommend using it at full strength instead of watering it down by applying it to a wet face, like the instructions say to. Also, don&#x27;t leave it on too long. It can be drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side...The presentation of this product is great. I mean, it comes in a cute little box and looks just adorable. It is fresh and clean feeling, and does deliver on it&#x27;s promise to make skin glow.</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth but can&#x27;t tell if it is doing anything at all. I don&#x27;t see &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; results to ensure it is worth repurchasing. Have been using if twice a week.</li>
    <li> I use this 2x per week after washing and toning. It helps keep my skin keep a healthy youthful glow.</li>
    <li> I love the product, it takes care of the smaller pimples (like the ones around the nose) and minimizes the large ones (on the cheek).  My only complaint is the size.  The amount is too little, more should be packages in a slightly larger container.  It says 1.2 ozs but it seems like less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this differently from the instructions.  After I clean my skin, I apply more than a thin layer on my face at night and sleep with the mask on.  It&#x27;s a gel, as it dries it tingles just so slightly.  Dries quickly and does not have the weird tight feeling I get with kaolin masks.  Some of it rubs off at night but most of it stays.  In the morning, the nose area is slightly oily.  I peel off what I can but remove most by washing my face.  After I get out of the shower and my face dries, but before toner, my skin feels soft and the number of pimples is less than what I had before applying the night.  I only use moisturizer during the day so I can&#x27;t speak to applying makeup or the staying power of makeup after using this.  My skin is smooth, soft &amp; less oily for several days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not solve many problems but I will be getting this again because it seems to help calm my skin.  As I try to find a routine for my skincare, I plan to keep this in rotation at least thru the end of the year.</li>
    <li> I Love it. Gets rid of dead skin and gives you a nice dewy look. I recommend this product 100%</li>
    <li> My skin is very sensitive when it comes to acids and Vitamin C products- I&#x27;ve tried other products that burned like crazy. This stuff is awesome! It&#x27;s a clear gel and you just apply a thin layer. It made skin feel warm and tingly for the first couple minutes (no pain though). When I washed it off, my skin was really soft and shiny, like all the dead skin cells had been washed away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried a sample of a different brand&#x27;s enzyme mask a couple weeks ago. It was a powder that you mix with water. It had the same effect as the the Angel Face, BUT that stuff cost about $80 and it had parabens in it. The Angel Face is a healthier product and much more reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> I like the idea of this product, and I eat papaya and pineapple for breakfast a few days a week for enzymes.  But this mask? No real effects. No tingling, no super fresh feeling, no tightened pores... Super expensive for a mediocre dose of exfoliation.  (I&#x27;m not peeling at all either, so not sure if it is exfoliating.)</li>
    <li> My skin was dull with clogged pores.  Now my skin is smooth with an even tone.  I use this mask as apart of my weekly facial treatment.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 52 years old and was battling chin acne.  Since I&#x27;ve started using masks and peels on an almost daily basis, my acne is GREATLY improved, and except for the occasional zit, my skin is clear.  This is a very good mask.  After I use it, the blackheads on my nose are improved and my pore size appears smaller.  I leave it on for about an hour (longer than instructed).  I have no negative side effects and occasionally experience minor tingling.  I alternate this masks with other masks and peels made by other companies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it under my eyes and at first and thought it improved the appearance of the lines under my eyes.  I&#x27;ve changed my opinion on that and believe I have made my under eye condition worse.  Please follow the instructions and AVOID use under the eyes.  I thought it improved my forehead lines, but I will have to watch and see.  I will alter this review if I think it makes my forehead lines worse.</li>
    <li> This is a great mask for highly sensitive skin - you may feel a slight tingle but it won&#x27;t burn.  Papaya is a great natural exfoliator.  It&#x27;s very gentle, and leaves your skin very soft, especially when you use with their Jojoba buff cream cleanser.  It&#x27;s a gel mask, so apply it thick enough to leave it wet and leave it on for a few minutes before rinsing off.  I like to use it in the shower after using a cleanser - apply and leave on while you shave your legs!!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> but not what I expected and doesn&#x27;t exfoliate.  hard to remove it just does nothing.  I am disappointed and would not recommend</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this three times now and have not seen any type of effect on my skin. It looks and feels like putting clear aloe vera gel on my skin and doesn&#x27;t do any type of exfoliating to my skin. I was also surprised by how teeny tiny the bottle is; kind of expensive for such a small amount, and since it&#x27;s not doing anything for me I would recommend trying a different product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally wanted to buy the Zia Papaya enzyme mask/peel, as I used it years ago and it was an amazing product. However, after reading reviews about that product being reformulated and not working anymore, I decided to try this one because it had so many great reviews. Maybe it&#x27;s just my skin, but the product doesn&#x27;t seem to work.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Pineapple &amp; Papaya mask once a week for 2 months. I have very sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use most exfoliating masks but this does not bother my skin at all. It doesn&#x27;t exfoliate quite as much as their Pumpkin mask, but it does a good job without the stinging and reddening skin, which is what I experienced with the pumpkin mask. Given that it does a good job, is gentle enough for sensitive skin, and is reasonably priced, I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Very gentle - overall amazing product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once but I liked the look and feel of my face after--not dry or red.  No tingling sensation for me and I have sensitive skin.  Easy to apply and rinse off.  Yes, a tiny, tiny jar but I didn&#x27;t goop it on and was pleased.  Going to try some of the other products to see how they are...</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be put off by the small, in fact, tiny size of this little jar!  The mask within contains a powerful, penetrating yet refreshing mask that will cleanse your skin and remove all the surface impurities you could ask for!  It is a small jar, but you don&#x27;t need to use much and this little jar will last you a long time!</li>
    <li> My wife just loves it.</li>
    <li> While the jar is smaller than I thought the product does work. It doesn&#x27;t take that much to cover your face and neck. I did leave it on a bit linger than stated ( was reading the paper).  It did take about 15 minutes for a tingling feeling.</li>
    <li> I would recommend to anyone!  Makes my skin feel soft and feeling great!!  It does not burn my face and I apply while in the shower.  Super easy and quick!!</li>
    <li> I really, really love this mask - especially after reading her suggestion to use it in the shower or with the herbal steam (which I also love).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using Tata Harper&#x27;s resurfacing mask, religiously, which is significantly more expensive for a lesser amount but it&#x27;s a well known, very popular mask.  I had gotten another sample of Angel Face&#x27;s Pineapple &amp; Papaya mask with an order and after using it, I realized that I got the same results with this mask as I did with the Tata Harper mask.  This Pineapple &amp; Papaya mask is absolutely as good (if I&#x27;m not mistaken, I think they also have similar ingredients?) - plus, you get a LOT more for a lesser price and I like supporting a smaller, more local company.</li>
    <li> I this mask because of all the great review I don&#x27;t now why they were giving such high rating from customers . I have used the masks now 4 times I can&#x27;t see any differents after , the mask is like a water based Vaseline , when I put the mask on my face i felled absulutly  nothing ..... unusual for a facemask not to fell anything . I would not buy this product anymore . Reviews sounded good but don&#x27;t get fooled by it .</li>
    <li> Thus is a nice product&lt;br /&gt;Skins looks great and shrinks pores on my nose&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this again for sure</li>
    <li> I guess I&#x27;m used to more intense exfoliating masks because this doesn&#x27;t do much at all for me. A wash cloth or a scrub works better as a gentle exfoliator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a silky, clear mask like most enzyme masks. If you don&#x27;t use any retinols, glycolics or salicylics, this product might be a good way to get started with exfoliating. Or a younger person in their teens or 20s who wants to carefully dry oily skin or breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you get any redness or irritation from this, mix with a little moisturizer before putting it on.</li>
    <li> Not impressed with this product at all. Did not notice really any difference after use (I followed their limited basic instructions). I&#x27;ve used other Papain and Bromelaid products at home and had noticable and effective Results.  Would Not buy this product again- don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> This works as great. I have sensitive skin so prefer to use an enzymatic exfoliant. Put it on for only a few minutes at a time, I found 3 minutes was best for me. I only wished it smelled good, it really has no smell whatsoever. I just like a nice scent while its sitting on my face!</li>
    <li> I love this mask, I use it every other morning in the shower and once a week with my facial steamer.  I used to have congested pores and this has really cleared everything out.  I will continue to buy and use this mask, my husband uses it as well for his sensitive skin, once a week and has noticed a difference.</li>
    <li> This is a great, natural product.  Do Not fall asleep with it on as you may get a reaction by leaving it on too long.  This is from experience.</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot.  It spreads easily and come off easily.  The only thing I do like about it is that it is such a small amount.</li>
    <li> Leave you face very soft and luminosity.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this mask! I had some really awful hormonal acne on the chin area this mask really seemed to help with that. I have continued using this product at the very least once a week. GREAT MASK!</li>
