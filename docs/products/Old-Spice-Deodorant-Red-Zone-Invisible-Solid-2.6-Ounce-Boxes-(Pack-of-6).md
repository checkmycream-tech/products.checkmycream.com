      <li>- Target has all together dropped Aqua Reef, most supermarket chains too -</li>
      <li>The product works really good,has nice scents&amp;#62;&lt;br /&gt;We like the Aqua Reef.</li>
      <li>Smells great and keeps me dry!</li>
      <li>In short, it works well and smells good.  </li>

      <li>Its a fresh, clean scent.  </li>
      <li>This deodorant keeps me dry and smelling good.  </li>
      <li>It smells so clean and crisp to me</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a pleasant smell, a little spicy, fresh, clean.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Probably still worth it.</li>
      <li>By far my favorite deodorant.  </li>
      <li>But for some reason, Old Spice has seen fit to discontinue this scent in an Antiperspirant version.</li>
      <li>Glad to have a six pack that will last a while.</li>
      <li>/&gt;-I feel like I go through a stick of it pretty fast.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t wear cologne, so this is apparently strong enough to get that</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if I put too much on or what,</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t wear any cologne, but I often get asked by people what cologne I wear because \\&quot;I smell really good.\\&quot;  </li>
      <li>/&gt;-It is very cologne/Old Spice smelling, if that makes any sense.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very picky about my supplemental body scents...</li>
      <li>and this does really well.</li>
      <li>Nothing too severe, but probably more than the average skinny guy.</li>
      <li>It is hard to find this in the stores; it is very convenient to purchase a group to save money and stock up; has a nice smell and works well</li>
      <li>I normally buy deodorant, which doesn&#x27;t contain aluminum.</li>
      <li>During my time in marine corps boot camp we all used aqua reef,even the body wash because its strong enough to over power the bad smells of boot camp, after I got out i had to get deoderant that is the best smeeling and last llong</li>
      <li>I love this deodorant and they stopped carrying it in every single store around where I live in favor of other scents (at least the kind with antiperspirant).</li>
      <li>Purely and simply put, I ordered Old Spice Deod.</li>
      <li>I use Lagerfeld cologne and Old Spice Aqua Reef.</li>
      <li>Secondly, it has a high level of Antiperspirant which some hippies might not like, but I prefer to not have sweaty pits.  </li>
      <li>This particular scent and brand is much more expensive at Albertsons.</li>
      <li>Yes, you can probably find it cheaper at Walgreens when they run a special on it, but I can be lazy and prefer Amazon Prime to send it to me instead.</li>
      <li>A lot of new, popular smells, even from Old Spice, show the bad influence of Axe.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Old Spice Red Zone Aqua Reef for probably ten years now.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Been impossible to find this in stores these days. Been using this same deoderant/antipersperant for over 10 years now. It&#x27;ll be a sad day when I won&#x27;t even be able to get it online. A bit pricey, but a solid product!</li>
    <li> During my time in marine corps boot camp we all used aqua reef,even the body wash because its strong enough to over power the bad smells of boot camp, after I got out i had to get deoderant that is the best smeeling and last llong and this does really well. I would recommend this to any person that wants to smell great, but buy this from walmart b/c it is like 2 dollars for one.</li>
    <li> Purely and simply put, I ordered Old Spice Deod. Red Zone Inv. Solid, Aqua Reef, 2.6 oz. boxes (Pack of 6) When it arrived, it was a pack of 1 for $29.80. Rep. of Amazon called me and said to keep it, and he would ship out a pkg. of 6 at no chge to me.When that arrived, it was a pkg. of 1 at n/c.  I called again and told them to quit and I would return them both and to credit my c/c.I paid for the shpg./and enclosed everything incl. pkg they arrived in and shipped back to them.  I just think the advertising was incorrect and the price of $29.80 inc. s/h was out of line for 1 item of 1. I shall check my c/c statement.</li>
    <li> It is hard to find this in the stores; it is very convenient to purchase a group to save money and stock up; has a nice smell and works well</li>
    <li> Thanks for shipping I&#x27;m so happy with this kind it&#x27;s my favourite!!! I want order again 😍&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> Just what we were looking for.</li>
    <li> Good price for the scent. This particular scent and brand is much more expensive at Albertsons. Glad to have a six pack that will last a while.</li>
    <li> By far my favorite deodorant.  Firstly, it has a great scent.  I don&#x27;t wear any cologne, but I often get asked by people what cologne I wear because \\&quot;I smell really good.\\&quot;  Its a fresh, clean scent.  Secondly, it has a high level of Antiperspirant which some hippies might not like, but I prefer to not have sweaty pits.  Additionally, I work out a lot and sweat a lot, and I have yet to offend anyone with my stench, and I credit this deodorant.  Yes, you can probably find it cheaper at Walgreens when they run a special on it, but I can be lazy and prefer Amazon Prime to send it to me instead.</li>
    <li> The product works really good,has nice scents&amp;#62;&lt;br /&gt;We like the Aqua Reef. Even tho its a man&#x27;s deodrant my husband suggested I try it and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;Works better than anything I have used before.</li>
    <li> Smells great and keeps me dry!</li>
    <li> I normally buy deodorant, which doesn&#x27;t contain aluminum. Although this is listed as \\&quot;deodorant\\&quot; it&#x27;s actually \\&quot;antiperspirant\\&quot; which usually does contain aluminum.</li>
    <li> For some reason, Proctor and Gamble stuff online is priced a little absurdly. This one especially. When you can find this stuff at Walmart (I know, it means going to Walmart...) it&#x27;s like $3, maybe less. And you don&#x27;t have to buy a six-month supply at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said - Target has all together dropped Aqua Reef, most supermarket chains too - so if Walmart is instock, great - otherwise you get fleeced online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably still worth it. It&#x27;s a pleasant smell, a little spicy, fresh, clean. Doesn&#x27;t offend. Strong enough to keep you from sweating too much, and even when I do - the combination of this stuff and sweat still isn&#x27;t bad (sometimes even get complimented on smelling nice... go figure). A lot of new, popular smells, even from Old Spice, show the bad influence of Axe. This stuff though isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very picky about my supplemental body scents...I use Lagerfeld cologne and Old Spice Aqua Reef. But for some reason, Old Spice has seen fit to discontinue this scent in an Antiperspirant version. So in order to stock up, I got this six pack....it will last me years...and hopefully by then I will be able to find another scent that agrees with me.</li>
    <li> Smells great and works!</li>
    <li> Aqua Reef is my absolute favorite scent of their deodorant line. It works great too! It is probably less expensive to purchase it in a store, but if this is the only place to get it, put it in your cart!</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant and they stopped carrying it in every single store around where I live in favor of other scents (at least the kind with antiperspirant). It smells so clean and crisp to me, I am so glad that I could get more of it.</li>
    <li> In short, it works well and smells good.  It smells a little floral, a little spicy, and it isn&#x27;t noxious like AXE and the like.</li>
    <li> I can confirm this is the anti-perpirant and deodorant.  It&#x27;s a bit confusing how it is labled on the page.  Great stuff been using for years it&#x27;s just hard to find in the stores anymore CVS doesn&#x27;t seem to carry anymore.</li>
    <li> Great product at a good price.  This deodorant keeps me dry and smelling good.  Note this is an anti-perspirant and deodorant.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this deodorant for the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has several cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It has aluminium which many countries are saying causes cancer.&lt;br /&gt;2. If you put it on and then put on a black tshirt, it tends to get a white mark.</li>
    <li> if you dont want to worry about running out or forgetting to put it on a list this is the way to go.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Old Spice Red Zone Aqua Reef for probably ten years now. Obviously, deodorant is a very personal choice for the average dude. This is the one I prefer. I&#x27;m a bigger guy and I can sweat bigger too. Nothing too severe, but probably more than the average skinny guy. This does the job well, even when I&#x27;m working out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Smells good&lt;br /&gt;-Holds down the stink&lt;br /&gt;-Keeps the sweat under control (I don&#x27;t sweat through shirts.)&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin&lt;br /&gt;-I&#x27;ve gotten compliments from people about smelling good and asking which cologne I wear. I don&#x27;t wear cologne, so this is apparently strong enough to get that response.&lt;br /&gt;-Great price on Amazon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-I feel like I go through a stick of it pretty fast. I don&#x27;t know if I put too much on or what, but I feel like it doesn&#x27;t last a long as a stick of deodorant should.&lt;br /&gt;-It is very cologne/Old Spice smelling, if that makes any sense. People who are odor-sensitive might be bothered by it.&lt;br /&gt;-It is hard to find in stores. In Minnesota, I can only find it in Walgreens. It is not available at Target or CVS as far as I can find.&lt;br /&gt;-I do find my undershirts eventually get the yellow stains in the armpits. For those who don&#x27;t know, yellow pit stains come from chemicals in deodorant, not your sweat. I always wear undershirts, so I don&#x27;t have the issue of wrecking nicer shirts.</li>
