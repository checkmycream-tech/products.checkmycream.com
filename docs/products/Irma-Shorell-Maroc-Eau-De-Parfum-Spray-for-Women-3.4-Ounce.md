### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>THIS WILL HOLD UP IN THE WINTER MONTHS FOR SURE!!!!  </li>
      <li>But I still recalled the beautiful scent &amp; was looking for it everywhere.</li>
      <li>What I&#x27;ve experienced is there.  </li>
      <li>I cannot explain how happy I am that I did.  </li>
      <li>It was great on HER, so I had to ask what it was because I&#x27;m a brunette and it seemed like something a dark-haired woman could wear that would enhance a sense of mystique.  </li>
      <li>What I&#x27;ve experienced is there.  </li>
      <li>I have always Loved this scent.</li>
      <li>I hope it smells as good on me as it did on her.  </li>
      <li>This is a good fragrance when I wear it, but it is not dynamite</li>
      <li>I wore this parfum just about everywhere, it is a good one to wear in warm weather, it just wafts through a room &amp; heads will turn.  </li>
      <li>I thought I liked Paloma when I smelled it on a cousin.  </li>
      <li>I thought I liked Paloma when I smelled it on a cousin.  </li>
      <li>Kind of Yeccchhh. . . .</li>
      <li>THIS WILL NOT BE FOR EVERYBODY BECAUSE IT HAS A VERY STRONG MEDICINE CABINET TYPE OF SMELL TO IT.  </li>
      <li>Then they continued to change the scent until it no longer resembled the fabulous Maroc that we all knew and loved.</li>
      <li>I used to love this perfume as a teenager when Ultima II put it out.  </li>
      <li>I just love, it brings back some wonderful memories.</li>
      <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You could argue that you should wear a fragrance that YOU love, yourself.  </li>
      <li>I hope I will be able to continue to purchase it.</li>
      <li>Do you have more and carry it all the time?</li>
      <li>She also said she gets many, many compliments on it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe my eye when I saw this perfume for sale, it was given to me as a gift many years ago</li>
      <li>The product is authentic and it smells just as I remember it.  </li>
      <li>Apparently an original version of this was made by a more famous design house.  </li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t like Chanel No. 5, which I&#x27;m always comfortable in and which I love.  </li>
      <li>But it is so strong that I never wear it.  </li>
      <li>But it is so strong that I never wear it.  </li>
      <li>You can imagine my shock and total joy when by happenstance; I searched and found it to be available on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>I used this fragrance several years ago and was happy to find it again.  </li>
      <li>Thank you for making it available.</li>
      <li>my arm, it seems to have a cheap aroma.</li>
      <li>In a fit of frustration I threw it in the trash</li>
      <li>my arm, it seems to have a cheap aroma.</li>
      <li>and I loved it instantly but couldn&#x27;t find it any more</li>
      <li>Right now, I&#x27;m enveloped in Caroline Herrera, which is stunning and which bowled me over when I sniffed it in the bottle.  </li>
      <li>I have a feeling I would have gone ape over the original fragrance and had to have it.  </li>
      <li>Is nothing like the original.</li>
      <li>Just like a recipe that someone leaves out an ingredient, this stuff is not even CLOSE to the original Maroc.  </li>
      <li>I have a feeling I would have gone ape over the original fragrance and had to have it.  </li>
      <li>Since I never smelled the original, I don&#x27;t sense the loss that some fans of the original fragrance experience.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The scent  smells nothing like the original.</li>
      <li>Still has the sweet, sweet power, but also a lot of ew in it, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
      <li>But it is SOOOOOO sweet.  </li>
      <li>It was heart breaking for me as I loved perfumes, especially this scent.</li>
      <li>Sweet smell and one of my favorites</li>
      <li>You sort of rush for a draft of fresh air.  </li>
      <li>With Paloma, you get the full thrust of it on the first gust of wind when the person walks by.  </li>
      <li>With Paloma, you get the full thrust of it on the first gust of wind when the person walks by.  </li>
      <li>You sort of rush for a draft of fresh air.  </li>
      <li>It is ok, nothing special, so I did not bother sending it back.</li>
      <li>Ever notice how most all perfumes tend to smell the same these days?  </li>
      <li>, I will be looking to keep it in stock for myself, thank you so much!</li>
      <li>I guess I&#x27;ll know better later.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This changes too, but it&#x27;s still pretty okay.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I will never know that.&gt;This changes too, but it&#x27;s still pretty okay.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I guess I&#x27;ll know better later.  </li>
      <li>This is an exciting, exotic fragrance that I think I like but am not 100% sure since I don&#x27;t know what other people smell when I&#x27;m wearing it, only what I smell.  </li>
      <li>the fragrances of all the old great perfumes are being reformulated, anyway, due to new federal health requirements pertaining to allergies (from what I&#x27;ve heard).  </li>
      <li>I want someone to catch a whiff and want more and wonder what it is  and be strangely drawn to it, to want to smell it again.  </li>
      <li>I want someone to catch a whiff and want more and wonder what it is  and be strangely drawn to it, to want to smell it again.  </li>
      <li>Not unpleasant, but not the old Maroc...</li>
      <li>/&gt;But, generally, I really like it.  </li>
      <li>, IT HAS TO BE USED VERY SPARINGLY.</li>
      <li>I used the real Maroc in the 1980&#x27;s when I was dating my ex fiance.</li>
      <li>But when it became necessary to reformulate it, some of the original formula had to be altered.  </li>
      <li>What is now in the fragrance is close to, but not the same as, the original.  </li>
      <li>Then Irma Shorell bought the patent and for awhile it was very similar to the original.</li>
      <li>Or White Shoulders, which is sweet and innocent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Or pretty much the same?  </li>
      <li>Mostly just to a few family</li>
      <li>I can say is that when I caught a whiff of it on someone in the same room, it was a bit exciting, had a sort of &amp;#34;burns</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it would be the right perfume for someone with red hair and freckles, or someone who looks like Sissy Spacek or Kate Hudson or her mom.  </li>
      <li>But I recently ordered what I thought would be the same wonderful smelling perfume, and I was wrong.</li>
      <li>The box is the only thing similar to the original.</li>
      <li>I used to wear this in the eighties and early nineties.</li>
      <li>But that doesn&#x27;t really count because when your nose gets used to a fragrance, you don&#x27;t get the same sensation as someone else does when they&#x27;re smelling</li>
      <li>It smelled old and rancid.  </li>
      <li>You can read the perfume reviews of it by professional reviewers who talk about high notes, and low notes, and hints of spice or florals or</li>
      <li>Since it&#x27;s not made anymore, this is probably a decent enough substitute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Since it&#x27;s not made anymore, this is probably a decent enough substitute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>He was highly allergic to perfumes, especially this one !</li>
      <li>WELL WORTH THE MONEY FOR THIS PERFUME BECAUSE IT WILL GO A LONG LONG WAY</li>
      <li>Too bad that these people took a beautiful scent and totally ruined it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m generally just telling you impressions, here, because that&#x27;s all the fragrances are about.  </li>
      <li>There is barely any scent at all.</li>
      <li>It was either a batch made back when I used it as a teen or the new manufacturer botched the formula.  </li>
      <li>On the other hand, there are so few fragrances that I DO love totally.</li>
      <li>Fragrance is only for a few seconds reminiscent of the original.</li>
      <li>I discovered this scent approximately 25 years ago and simply fell in love with the fragrance.  </li>
      <li>My honey didn&#x27;t comment on it, either, but he does comment when I wear White Shoulders, which is not really my idea of an intriguing fragrance and which is not really me, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>are good or bad</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I used to wear this in the eighties and early nineties. I hated it when it was discontinued and bought it anywhere I could find it. Then Irma Shorell bought the patent and for awhile it was very similar to the original. Then they continued to change the scent until it no longer resembled the fabulous Maroc that we all knew and loved. The last bottle that I bought from them some years ago was disgusting and I returned it. A friend bought me a bottle of this knock off last Christmas and I can&#x27;t even stand to wear it. Too bad that these people took a beautiful scent and totally ruined it.</li>
    <li> This is an exciting, exotic fragrance that I think I like but am not 100% sure since I don&#x27;t know what other people smell when I&#x27;m wearing it, only what I smell.  It isn&#x27;t like Chanel No. 5, which I&#x27;m always comfortable in and which I love.  Or, like Paloma, which blows you over with power.  Or White Shoulders, which is sweet and innocent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is actually foreign and complex and -- I think -- somewhat intriguing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least, that was my opinion when I got a whiff of it on someone else.  It was great on HER, so I had to ask what it was because I&#x27;m a brunette and it seemed like something a dark-haired woman could wear that would enhance a sense of mystique.  She told me the name, and we ended up also admiring each other&#x27;s tastes in varous things.  Apparently an original version of this was made by a more famous design house.  But when it became necessary to reformulate it, some of the original formula had to be altered.  What is now in the fragrance is close to, but not the same as, the original.  Since I never smelled the original, I don&#x27;t sense the loss that some fans of the original fragrance experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The woman who was wearing this perfume said she gets stopped all the time and asked about the fragrance.  She also said she gets many, many compliments on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not really worn it out enough to have collected the type of compliments that she has amassed.  Mostly just to a few family functions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, generally, I really like it.  I hope it smells as good on me as it did on her.  My honey didn&#x27;t comment on it, either, but he does comment when I wear White Shoulders, which is not really my idea of an intriguing fragrance and which is not really me, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m generally just telling you impressions, here, because that&#x27;s all the fragrances are about.  Impressions and feelings.&lt;br /&gt;None are good or bad -- it&#x27;s just what you like.  And I think I like this.  I don&#x27;t think it would be the right perfume for someone with red hair and freckles, or someone who looks like Sissy Spacek or Kate Hudson or her mom.  I think it&#x27;s definitely for dark-haired women.  You can read the perfume reviews of it by professional reviewers who talk about high notes, and low notes, and hints of spice or florals or whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is that when I caught a whiff of it on someone in the same room, it was a bit exciting, had a sort of &amp;#34;burns the tongue&amp;#34; sensation (even though I, obviously, didn&#x27;t taste it at all), and a dark, veiled sense of desire, or passion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope it smells that way on me, too, but I don&#x27;t know because when I spray it on my arm, and then sniff my arm later, it does NOT smell that way at all.  In fact, it was disappointing when I sniffed my arm where I had sprayed it.  But that doesn&#x27;t really count because when your nose gets used to a fragrance, you don&#x27;t get the same sensation as someone else does when they&#x27;re smelling it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You could argue that you should wear a fragrance that YOU love, yourself.  This is a good fragrance when I wear it, but it is not dynamite and I don&#x27;t adore being swallowed up in it.  On the other hand, there are so few fragrances that I DO love totally. Right now, I&#x27;m enveloped in Caroline Herrera, which is stunning and which bowled me over when I sniffed it in the bottle.  But it is SOOOOOO sweet.  Now that it&#x27;s been on for a few hours, it is turning into treacle with a strand of salt running through it.  Kind of Yeccchhh. . . . and ick, and ewww.  Still has the sweet, sweet power, but also a lot of ew in it, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the fragrances of all the old great perfumes are being reformulated, anyway, due to new federal health requirements pertaining to allergies (from what I&#x27;ve heard).  So our choices are getting vastly limited.  Ever notice how most all perfumes tend to smell the same these days?  Or pretty much the same?  Or how they change a lot after they&#x27;ve been on you for 10 minutes?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This changes too, but it&#x27;s still pretty okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I *think* it does it&#x27;s job.  But I&#x27;ve only had it for a little while and I don&#x27;t wear it every day.  I guess I&#x27;ll know better later.  Then I&#x27;ll come back and revise this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I might end up wearing it -- which is saying a lot.  I thought I liked Paloma when I smelled it on a cousin.  So I bought it.  But it is so strong that I never wear it.  I&#x27;m NOT my cousin. I don&#x27;t want to BE ABOUT my fragrance.  I want someone to catch a whiff and want more and wonder what it is  and be strangely drawn to it, to want to smell it again.  With Paloma, you get the full thrust of it on the first gust of wind when the person walks by.  You sort of rush for a draft of fresh air.  This is the reverse.  You catch a drift of it and wonder where it came from and you want to go there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is something that hits you, and then you wonder, &amp;#34;What WAS that?  That&#x27;s nice!&lt;br /&gt;Who&#x27;s wearing that?&amp;#34;  And then you have to figure it out.&lt;br /&gt;On my arm, it seems to have a cheap aroma. Too salty.  Too thin.  But, again, I&#x27;m sniffing my skin, not catching the molecules left hanging in the air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t go any further.  What I&#x27;ve experienced is there.  I have a feeling I would have gone ape over the original fragrance and had to have it.  Since it&#x27;s not made anymore, this is probably a decent enough substitute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is, assuming it smells on me something like it did on her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I will never know that.&gt;This changes too, but it&#x27;s still pretty okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I *think* it does it&#x27;s job.  But I&#x27;ve only had it for a little while and I don&#x27;t wear it every day.  I guess I&#x27;ll know better later.

You catch a drift of it and wonder where it came from and you want to go there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is something that hits you, and then you wonder, &amp;#34;What WAS that?  That&#x27;s nice!&lt;br /&gt;Who&#x27;s wearing that?&amp;#34;  And then you have to figure it out.&lt;br /&gt;On my arm, it seems to have a cheap aroma. Too salty.  Too thin.  But, again, I&#x27;m sniffing my skin, not catching the molecules left hanging in the air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t go any further.  What I&#x27;ve experienced is there.  I have a feeling I would have gone ape over the original fragrance and had to have it.  Since it&#x27;s not made anymore, this is probably a decent enough substitute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is, assuming it smells on me something like it did on her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I will never know that.</li>
    <li> This smells nothing like the Maroc of the 80&#x27;s.  It smells like bug spray.  I threw it in the garbage can.</li>
    <li> I used to love this perfume as a teenager when Ultima II put it out.  But I recently ordered what I thought would be the same wonderful smelling perfume, and I was wrong. It smelled old and rancid.  It was either a batch made back when I used it as a teen or the new manufacturer botched the formula.  Very disappointed.  In a fit of frustration I threw it in the trash or I would have returned it.</li>
    <li> Is nothing like the original. Very disappointed. There is barely any scent at all. I would not buy anything from Irma Shorell again.</li>
    <li> THIS WILL NOT BE FOR EVERYBODY BECAUSE IT HAS A VERY STRONG MEDICINE CABINET TYPE OF SMELL TO IT.  I LIKE THAT MEDICINE CABINET TYPE OF SMELL TO MY PERFUMES.  THIS WILL HOLD UP IN THE WINTER MONTHS FOR SURE!!!!  HALIE BERRY&#x27;S PERFUME HAS THIS TYPE OF SMELL TO ALSO BUT HALIE&#x27;S WILL NOT HOLD UP IN THE WINTER LIKE THIS ONE WILL!!!!  WELL WORTH THE MONEY FOR THIS PERFUME BECAUSE IT WILL GO A LONG LONG WAY, IT HAS TO BE USED VERY SPARINGLY.</li>
    <li> Sweet smell and one of my favorites</li>
    <li> I have always Loved this scent. I received it as a gift back in the day. I always receive compliments  on the scent from both Men&lt;br /&gt;and Women. I hope I will be able to continue to purchase it.</li>
    <li> I used the real Maroc in the 1980&#x27;s when I was dating my ex fiance. He was highly allergic to perfumes, especially this one ! It was heart breaking for me as I loved perfumes, especially this scent. So I quit buying it &amp; when I broke up with him eventually, I started using other colognes &amp; perfumes. But I still recalled the beautiful scent &amp; was looking for it everywhere. Initially it was made by Ultima II . The box is the only thing similar to the original. The scent  smells nothing like the original. It is ok, nothing special, so I did not bother sending it back. A disappointment, save your money!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe my eye when I saw this perfume for sale, it was given to me as a gift many years ago and I loved it instantly but couldn&#x27;t find it any more, I will be looking to keep it in stock for myself, thank you so much! Do you have more and carry it all the time?</li>
    <li> Not unpleasant, but not the old Maroc...I would not buy it again :(</li>
    <li> I wore this parfum just about everywhere, it is a good one to wear in warm weather, it just wafts through a room &amp; heads will turn.  If you can wear musk, you should try it.  It is to bad it is no longer available in department stores. I just love, it brings back some wonderful memories.</li>
    <li> I used this fragrance several years ago and was happy to find it again.  Thank you for making it available.</li>
    <li> Just like a recipe that someone leaves out an ingredient, this stuff is not even CLOSE to the original Maroc.  It vaguely copies the fragrance, but smells cheap, and doesn&#x27;t have any of the base notes of the original.  Save your money.</li>
    <li> Not long lasting, very poorly crafted scent. Fragrance is only for a few seconds reminiscent of the original. Very disappointing to a fan who was ready to be a devoted customer!</li>
    <li> I discovered this scent approximately 25 years ago and simply fell in love with the fragrance.  As the years passed, I learned that the fragrance had been discontinued.  You can imagine my shock and total joy when by happenstance; I searched and found it to be available on Amazon.  I have to admit that I was somewhat skeptical about the product being authentic, but I took a chance anyway.  I cannot explain how happy I am that I did.  The product is authentic and it smells just as I remember it.  I will buy it again.</li>
