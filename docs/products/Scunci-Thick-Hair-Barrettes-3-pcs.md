### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>A very happy customer!</li>
      <li>How great to have found them again!</li>
      <li>What a great deal.  </li>
      <li>I did not give them a fair chance</li>
      <li>My favorite!  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping, excellent packaging.</li>
      <li>I love them.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad to have found these on Amazon.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re simply the best!</li>
      <li>No barrette has ever been able to hold it as well as these.</li>
      <li>I just twist it and then clip it up on top of my head -</li>
      <li>The product was brand new, in great shape, I would buy from this vendor again.</li>
      <li>One would hold it but two makes it feel more secure while I run.</li>
      <li>these are the best for keeping thick hair in place, and over the years I have tried many !</li>
      <li>The barretts are beautiful and as stated they can hold a big handfull of hair.  </li>
      <li>I had an original one that I have held onto and used for years even though the coating has chipped off.</li>
      <li>These work well although I don&#x27;t believe that they are quite as sturdy as my original.</li>
      <li>So happy to get some new ones my old barrettes were looking tarnished and peeling.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I have been looking for, for years!</li>
      <li>The BEST for thick hair!  </li>
      <li>My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t buy more!  </li>
      <li>I had these from 10 years ago and ended up giving my last 2 or 3 to sister in law who loved them so much.  </li>
      <li>The shipping is pricey, but well worth it for these rare barrettes.</li>
      <li>wanted to buy more recently and could not find them anywhere!  </li>
      <li>These are great for thick hair.</li>
      <li>I had some of these barrettes years ago and haven&#x27;t been able to find them for a long time.</li>
      <li>Thanks, Amazon.</li>
      <li>They are the only kind that will allow me to pull my hair back.  </li>
      <li>They are the only kind that stay in, you can sleep on them they&#x27;re so flat, and they never pull hairs!  </li>
      <li>Wish they were just a little more elongated.</li>
      <li>Since I live in Las Vegas I can now wear my hair in style and with a hat.</li>
      <li>these are about the only barrettes that I&#x27;ve been able to find that actually hold all of my hair without me really straining to get the barrette closed.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing an old one with boo-coo chips in it for over a year to workout in.  </li>
      <li>No more searching for comfortable clips-they always end up pulling, and I can&#x27;t wear hats with clips.  </li>
      <li>After countless searching in local stores and buying barrettes that will not hold my thick collar bone length hair, I was thrilled to find these.</li>
      <li>Goody also makes a wider metal barrette that I can close (but barely), but I end up bending it out of shape when I do.</li>
      <li>There is no way these barettes fit thick hair.  </li>
      <li>It was a little expensive but overall a great product</li>
      <li>I like to put it up in a high pony tail (using a barrette) and then roll it up or down and trap with another barrette, which makes for plenty of thickness.</li>

<li> if these barrettes fit then u do NOT have thick hair!!</li>
<li> Like the product works well for long hair to put up.</li>
<li> I have long hair, but it&#x27;s not amazingly thick--just normal.</li>
<li> I can no longer find this length barrette at my local stores and the shorter ones are too little to go around my hair.</li>
<li> These are the only barrettes that will hold my long, thick hair.</li>
<li> If you have really thick hair (mine is very thick, straight, and long), these are the way to go.  </li>
<li> Thank you for having a product that actually works for thick hair.  </li>
<li> , I&#x27;ve had them for a little while now, got used to them, they do work for long thick hair.  </li>
<li> They are to stiff for my liking.  </li>
<li> Do not buy this product unless you are buying for a kid who has very little hair.</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s still a little small if you have Soper thick hair.</li>
<li> I have very thick and heavy hair.</li>
<li> these are not for thick hair ....</li>
<li> I have really thick hair, and I&#x27;ve used these barrettes before.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know what people think thick hair is.</li>
<li> Helped with my thick hair</li>
<li> I was utterly disappointed in this product, and no longer trust Conair (Scunci) items labeled &amp;#34;&amp;#34;thick hair.&amp;#34;</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been madly looking for these barrettes for months!  </li>

    <li> I don&#x27;t know what people think thick hair is. if these barrettes fit then u do NOT have thick hair!!</li>
    <li> I can no longer find this length barrette at my local stores and the shorter ones are too little to go around my hair. I have long hair, but it&#x27;s not amazingly thick--just normal.

I&#x27;m so glad to have found these on Amazon. Thanks, Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is an amendent to my prior review.  I did not give them a fair chance, I&#x27;ve had them for a little while now, got used to them, they do work for long thick hair.  Wish they were just a little more elongated. They are to stiff for my liking.  I was used to another brand. Fast shipping, excellent packaging.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for these in the stores for several months now.  I have really thick hair, and I&#x27;ve used these barrettes before.  They are the only kind that will allow me to pull my hair back.  I love them.</li>
    <li> My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t buy more!  I will be re-ordering for myself and friends.  The barretts are beautiful and as stated they can hold a big handfull of hair.  What a great deal.  No more searching for comfortable clips-they always end up pulling, and I can&#x27;t wear hats with clips.  Since I live in Las Vegas I can now wear my hair in style and with a hat.</li>
    <li> Thank you for having a product that actually works for thick hair.  The product was brand new, in great shape, I would buy from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for these forever and  could not find them anywhere! I&#x27;ve been wearing an old one with boo-coo chips in it for over a year to workout in.  They stay in.  I just reordered a second set.  The shipping is pricey, but well worth it for these rare barrettes.</li>
    <li> I had these from 10 years ago and ended up giving my last 2 or 3 to sister in law who loved them so much.  wanted to buy more recently and could not find them anywhere!  They are the only kind that stay in, you can sleep on them they&#x27;re so flat, and they never pull hairs!  The BEST for thick hair!  If they were cheaper I&#x27;d buy dozens!  I just wish they didn&#x27;t have paint that chips off.</li>
    <li> Like the product works well for long hair to put up. It was a little expensive but overall a great product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been madly looking for these barrettes for months!  I wish Goody/Scunci still made them!</li>

I had an original one that I have held onto and used for years even though the coating has chipped off. These work well although I don&#x27;t believe that they are quite as sturdy as my original.

    <li> these are not for thick hair ....no way</li>
    <li> these are the best for keeping thick hair in place, and over the years I have tried many !</li>
    <li> This was the biggest piece of junk I have ever bought from Amazon.  There is no way these barettes fit thick hair.  I cannot even get them to close when I put a lock of hair into them.  Do not buy this product unless you are buying for a kid who has very little hair.</li>
    <li> If you have really thick hair (mine is very thick, straight, and long), these are the way to go.  I use them when I want to get my hair up off my neck - I just twist it and then clip it up on top of my head - these are about the only barrettes that I&#x27;ve been able to find that actually hold all of my hair without me really straining to get the barrette closed.  Goody also makes a wider metal barrette that I can close (but barely), but I end up bending it out of shape when I do.</li>
    <li> These are great for thick hair.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I have been looking for, for years!</li>
    <li> I had some of these barrettes years ago and haven&#x27;t been able to find them for a long time. How great to have found them again! They&#x27;re simply the best!</li>
    <li> Helped with my thick hair but it&#x27;s still a little small if you have Soper thick hair.</li>
    <li> Either my hair cannot be contained, OR these barrettes are not as advertised. I was utterly disappointed in this product, and no longer trust Conair (Scunci) items labeled &amp;#34;&amp;#34;thick hair.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Not that convinient.&lt;br /&gt;Hard to close...</li>
    <li> My favorite!  I had not found this size for a such a long time I quit looking for them.  So happy to get some new ones my old barrettes were looking tarnished and peeling.</li>
    <li> These are the only barrettes that will hold my long, thick hair.</li>
    <li> I have very thick and heavy hair. No barrette has ever been able to hold it as well as these. I like to use these barrettes when I work out. I have long hair, so I usually french braid it and then pin it up with two of these. One would hold it but two makes it feel more secure while I run.</li>
