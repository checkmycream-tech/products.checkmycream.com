      <li>Never have I received more compliments on my skin and &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; as since I began using this!</li>

      <li>I am so pleased with Ouvelle that I never want to be without it.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s why I am so glad my girlfriend told me about this collagen peptide serum.</li>
      <li>I am pleased with this firming serum.</li>
      <li>I have tried many wrinkle serums and creams, but none of them even comes even close to this one.</li>
      <li>I have been so pleased.....</li>
      <li>After several weeks of use, I see wonderful results in the appearance of my skin.</li>
      <li>It feels softer to the touch and is more hydrated.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>She found the product to be refreshing.</li>
      <li>And she’s really glad she did.</li>
      <li>Love the way it glides on and saturates my skin.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad she did.</li>
      <li>I’ve been using this every day since and found that my fine lines are almost gone and my skin feels much more supple.</li>
      <li>I love how smoothly it goes on.</li>
      <li>Having healthy looking skin is important to us men as we age.</li>
      <li>When I put my makeup on after applying Ouevelle, their is a brightness and a pore free, more youthful appearance</li>
      <li>I am thrilled, I have been very faithful in the application, morning &amp; night ( I use a bit more than pea size and do the throat line) followed by a light moisturizer.</li>
      <li>She says that it makes her face feel firmer, smoother and radiant and that her fine lines are going away.</li>
      <li>After a couple of weeks my skin looks smoother and I have noticed a decrease in some fine lines around my eyes and lip area.  </li>
      <li>I have fine lines on my forehead</li>
      <li>Fine lines are disappearing.</li>
      <li>Especially around her eyes she noticed how the skin was more taut yet supple and the Ouvelle was seemingly more effective</li>
      <li>I have tried many different creams, but this one is far the best.  </li>
      <li>&amp;#34; I felt the difference fairly soon, soft, smooth baby bottom texture.</li>
      <li>I live in a warm climate, and heavy creams make my skin greasy, so this serum is the perfect solution.</li>
      <li>Just one pump of the serum is enough for my face and neck, it feels great going on and absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>My wife has an olive complexion and was willing to try the Ouvelle and pleased with the results.  </li>
      <li>Now I know that no product could possibly get rid of all my lines and wrinkles, but this one does a darn good job of firming up my skin and reducing my fine lines.</li>
      <li>And as a 59 year old, I LOVE hearing that!</li>
      <li>Using this in the am and a retinal at night followed by a sweet potato lotion.</li>
      <li>, however I am giving it more time to see if it really will make a difference.</li>
      <li>She said her skin feels more moisturized overall and smoother and more elastic</li>
      <li>It contains high end ingredients that I&#x27;ve been paying a king&#x27;s ransom for but has delivered much better results.</li>
      <li>Even though I take good care of my skin, I’ve had this fine line that runs down my cheek</li>
      <li>You should put this on after you cleanse your face, let it dry, then put on a good moistureizer, like ROC,&lt;br /&gt;or  Revitalift products.  </li>
      <li>The pump is easy to use for me (thank you) and the serum is really lightweight and non-greasy.</li>
      <li>I use it twice a  day on clean skin, it absorbs very fast too.</li>
      <li>My wife wanted this collagen serum and so far she has been pleased with the results.  </li>
      <li>Right away, I felt my skin tightening up.</li>
      <li>I love the way it dispenses only the amount you need and how quickly it absorbs without making your skin feel sticky or greasy.</li>
      <li>I got this Collagen Peptide Serum for my mom because every year new wrinkles and fine lines appear around her eyes, face and the chest area.</li>
      <li>I will make sure she will follow this skincare routine regularly as she is one of those moms who needs constant reminder when it comes to their own beauty.  </li>
      <li>She just started using it, but so far she told me its easy to use</li>
      <li>Definitely glad I added this to my daily regimen.</li>
      <li>I am really pleased with this product and will continue daily use.</li>
      <li>Glad I found this terrific and affordable peptide serum</li>
      <li>Simply put, my skin just feels and looks better.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light, absorbs quickly and definitely made my skin feel fresher.</li>
      <li>I am already noticing positive results.</li>
      <li>Although she&#x27;s tried many products (Este Lauder, Olay, Clinique), the results she was seeing did not live up to her expectations.  </li>
      <li>Previous products containing acid have been problematic for her, but this cream has been gentle yet effective on her skin.</li>
      <li>It is very lightweight, not greasy at all, and makes my face feel refreshed and look smoother.  </li>
      <li>It has really made a difference in the feel and look of the skin.</li>
      <li>I really like this serum.  </li>
      <li>A real find.</li>
      <li>No matter how gently I try to get the product out, it goes flying across the room.  </li>
      <li>Got this as a gift for my cousin and she absolutely loves it.  </li>
      <li>This product really makes a difference in how my skin looks and feels.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s lightweight not greasy and absorbs very well.</li>
      <li>, the seller contacted me almost immediately to make sure everything was as expected.  </li>
      <li>I feel I am appreciated and vice versa.  </li>
      <li>It really works.</li>
      <li>Plus, bottle was very sticky and serum sprayed all over the place.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve even gotten a few compliments on how nice my skin looks.</li>
      <li>It actually feels cool and soothing when applied.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m certainly not a skin care expert (although I&#x27;m slowly becoming one)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am pleased with this firming serum. I have had a chance to try the product for a couple of weeks now and see some nice results.  You only need a small amount of cream to apply to the whole face and when it dries you feel a tightening effect.  After a couple of weeks my skin looks smoother and I have noticed a decrease in some fine lines around my eyes and lip area.  I do however, feel the size of the bottle is a little bit on the smaller side. Otherwise, it is a great product that I will continue using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount for review purposes and my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> I am a 57 year old woman that wants to stay young and vibrant looking and I feel this Ouvelle serum has made a definite difference for me.  I have been using this great product for about a month now.  My face looks more refreshed and my skins feels firm and supple.  And I have particularly noticed that the lines on my upper lip are less defined.  I also like the non-greasy feel when I apply the product and the fact that there are no added fragrances.  I am really pleased with this product and will continue daily use.</li>
    <li> My wife wanted this collagen serum and so far she has been pleased with the results.  With multi peptides, she has found this firming cream to help reduce wrinkles and age lines.  In addition, she has relativity sensitive skin and this cream has not been a problem for her.  Previous products containing acid have been problematic for her, but this cream has been gentle yet effective on her skin.</li>
    <li> My skin feels amazing! I have been using this product twice a day for three weeks and already see great results. I&#x27;ve had a bad habit of buying high end, expensive products much to my husband&#x27;s dismay. That&#x27;s why I am so glad my girlfriend told me about this collagen peptide serum. Great results at a great price! It contains high end ingredients that I&#x27;ve been paying a king&#x27;s ransom for but has delivered much better results. My skin is visibly firmer and tighter. It feels softer to the touch and is more hydrated. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> My beautiful wife had been complaining about fine wrinkles around her eyes (which frankly I don&#x27;t see) for a while.  Since I&#x27;m the online shopper, she set me on the task of finding something to abate the lines she was seeing.  Research and reviews lead me to the Ouvelle products.  Although she&#x27;s tried many products (Este Lauder, Olay, Clinique), the results she was seeing did not live up to her expectations.  I know that there are lots of products out there and many of them PRICEY!  I&#x27;ve also learned to beware of the &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;after&amp;#34; photos that you&#x27;ll find in ads.  These clearly mean &amp;#34;before and after photoshop&amp;#34;.  I was impressed by the online reviews for this products and the price.  My wife has an olive complexion and was willing to try the Ouvelle and pleased with the results.  Following the directions &amp;#34;cleanse, towel dry, apply a small amount on face and neck and apply moisturizer when dry&amp;#34; seems to be effective.  She found the product to be refreshing. Especially around her eyes she noticed how the skin was more taut yet supple and the Ouvelle was seemingly more effective that the others she has used.  I&#x27;m certainly not a skin care expert (although I&#x27;m slowly becoming one) but I&#x27;m happy that she&#x27;s happy.  It must be the peptides!</li>
    <li> Although the product is great, the dispenser is horrible.  I haven&#x27;t had this for very long, but so much of the product has been wasted.  No matter how gently I try to get the product out, it goes flying across the room.  It&#x27;s a shame, because this is really a great product.</li>
    <li> I am a 61 year old woman and I purchased this product mainly to use on my neck. I love the way it dispenses only the amount you need and how quickly it absorbs without making your skin feel sticky or greasy. This bottle lasts for me for 1 month. I have purchased a second. I have noticed that my skin has improved some, however I am giving it more time to see if it really will make a difference.</li>
    <li> Never have I received more compliments on my skin and &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; as since I began using this! It vaguely reminds me of another &amp;#34;miracle serum&amp;#34;, if you will, that I&#x27;ve come to experience in the past, but stands out on it&#x27;s own nonetheless. Nice to see Ventura on the bottle too!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about a week.  I have noticed that the lines on either side of my mouth are a lot less noticeable!!!  I also have seen a&lt;br /&gt;reduction to the wrinkles under my eyes.  You should put this on after you cleanse your face, let it dry, then put on a good moistureizer, like ROC,&lt;br /&gt;or  Revitalift products.  It seems to enhance the effectiveness of this product.  Give it a try, it does not sting or burn, it just works!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost 2 weeks. I can&#x27;t believe it but I&#x27;ve already seen results. The fine line around my eyes have tightened up and even my &#x27;chicken neck&#x27; seems to be more firm! I love how smoothly it goes on. It doesn&#x27;t sting or burn either. I will definitely continue using this product!</li>
    <li> My daughter suggested this collagen serum and I&#x27;m glad she did. I&#x27;ve only been using it now for a few weeks and I&#x27;ve already seen an improvement in my skin!! My face is smoother, plumper and, dare I say, brighter! Simply put, my skin just feels and looks better. And since I&#x27;m in my 80s, that&#x27;s saying a lot! The pump is easy to use for me (thank you) and the serum is really lightweight and non-greasy. Now I know that no product could possibly get rid of all my lines and wrinkles, but this one does a darn good job of firming up my skin and reducing my fine lines.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife since she asked for it as a present idea. She just started using it, but so far she told me its easy to use and she likes the way it works and feels.</li>
    <li> Love the way it glides on and saturates my skin.  Feel it is already showing improvement.  Skin glows and seems firmer.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the seller contacted me almost immediately to make sure everything was as expected.  I feel I am appreciated and vice versa.  Will be a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> This product is on my WOW list of products. After just 5 days of use I can see amazing results. I&#x27;m an old lady, 52 and I have wrinkles and saggy skin on my face. The best thing this product did for me was firming up my skin. My daughter just commented about how rested I look today. It really works. It&#x27;s lightweight not greasy and absorbs very well. Thankfully it only takes a small amount to cover the face. (I wouldn&#x27;t want to run out before I re-ordered) I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found this wonderful collagen peptide serum. It&#x27;s only been a few weeks that I have been using it but, in my case, that&#x27;s enough time to see real results. Fine lines are disappearing. My skin feels tighter and smoother. I&#x27;ve even gotten a few compliments on how nice my skin looks. And as a 59 year old, I LOVE hearing that! Just one pump of the serum is enough for my face and neck, it feels great going on and absorbs quickly. I think I&#x27;ve found a winner here!</li>
    <li> Using this in the am and a retinal at night followed by a sweet potato lotion. I have definitely started to see improvement in the lines around my lips, jawline is firmer and less puffiness under my eyes. No change in age spot yet. My skin looks healthier and softer and the tone more even.  Only complaint is it is hard to tell how much is left in the container.</li>
    <li> I really like this serum.  It&#x27;s light, absorbs quickly and definitely made my skin feel fresher. I live in a warm climate, and heavy creams make my skin greasy, so this serum is the perfect solution.</li>
    <li> Having healthy looking skin is important to us men as we age. Glad I found this terrific and affordable peptide serum - it&#x27;s made a real difference for me in a relatively short time. I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over a month now. My skin is tighter, smoother and my face feels refreshed. This product delivers great value at a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for 3 days now, and its wonderful! my skin feels lighter and fresher. it absorbs well. and the redness is gone. I have tried many different creams, but this one is far the best.  flakiness and dryness is bona and redness too.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend wanted an anti-aging serum that contained multiple peptides because she heard that is the way to go. So after looking at a bunch of products, she decided on this one primarily because of the great ingredients. And she’s really glad she did. She says that it makes her face feel firmer, smoother and radiant and that her fine lines are going away. I’m glad she did because she just looks great and is really happy with the result.</li>
    <li> I have tried many wrinkle serums and creams, but none of them even comes even close to this one. The first time I used it, I actually felt my skin tighten up as it dried! I’ve been using this every day since and found that my fine lines are almost gone and my skin feels much more supple.</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with Ouvelle that I never want to be without it.  &amp;#34; I felt the difference fairly soon, soft, smooth baby bottom texture. But  what I noticed after several weeks is the tightening and firming that has happened.  Wow, I can see my cheekbones again and the sagging jaw line is firmer and less noticeable.&amp;#34;. I love this product, my face is smoother, but being 75 I know all of the wrinkles will not be gone...but it keeps getting better.. When I put my makeup on after applying Ouevelle, their is a brightness and a pore free, more youthful appearance and I have been getting compliments on my over all look. I am thrilled, I have been very faithful in the application, morning &amp; night ( I use a bit more than pea size and do the throat line) followed by a light moisturizer. I have been so pleased.....keep those products coming!</li>
    <li> Only lasted 4 weeks. Will not purchase again. Plus, bottle was very sticky and serum sprayed all over the place.</li>
    <li> Very nice, makes my skin look and feel much better!  Tighter skin, and less lines visible right away.</li>
    <li> Just started using this a few days ago, haven&#x27;t seen any results yet but it is nice clean feeling formula!</li>
    <li> At last, a serum that solves my problem areas! Here’s my story. Even though I take good care of my skin, I’ve had this fine line that runs down my cheek that has always bothered me (I thought about a mini face lift). And until now, nothing I’ve tried has helped (trust me, I&#x27;ve tried a lot, and have spent a lot). But after using this Ouvelle peptide serum for a while, I don’t see that line anymore! Yay! So I thought I’d try using it on the lines on my chest that women get from their breasts and sleeping on their side.. And now they’re gone too. Wow! Now, the only thing that is missing in this product is monthly auto ship. I would hate to run out.</li>
    <li> Every daughter cares about their mom and wants them to stay beautiful forever. I am no exception. I got this Collagen Peptide Serum for my mom because every year new wrinkles and fine lines appear around her eyes, face and the chest area. I always want her to stay and look young. I reminded her to use the serum daily, and wow, her skin got FIRMER, SMOOTHER, and BRIGHTER in a week. She combined it with anti-aging moisturizer for better results. I will make sure she will follow this skincare routine regularly as she is one of those moms who needs constant reminder when it comes to their own beauty.  I don&#x27;t mind. I definitely recommend you this product if you are over 40, or get it for your mom. She will thank you.</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff.  Got this as a gift for my cousin and she absolutely loves it.  She said her skin feels more moisturized overall and smoother and more elastic</li>
    <li> I have used it for several weeks on my chin and throat area.  It has really made a difference in the feel and look of the skin. Tighter.  I recommend it!</li>
    <li> I’m so happy to have found this serum. I have very sensitive skin and have had no problems at all using this product. It actually feels cool and soothing when applied. After several weeks of use, I see wonderful results in the appearance of my skin. My fifty-something year old face looks great! A real find. It’s now part of my daily routine.</li>
    <li> This product really makes a difference in how my skin looks and feels. Wow! Right away, I felt my skin tightening up. My little lines are fading away. My face is smoother. I feel refreshed! Even friends that I haven’t seen in months told me how nice my skin looks. Can’t beat that!</li>
    <li> Makes my skin looking smoother after two months of use. I will be reordering this</li>
    <li> Using with the roller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Derma Roller-The Ultimate &amp;#34;No Surgery Needed&amp;#34; At-Home Cosmetic Treatment The Microneedle Derma Micro Roller&#x27;s 600 1.0mm Titanium</li>
    <li> I have been applying this every morning and I love it. It is very lightweight, not greasy at all, and makes my face feel refreshed and look smoother.  I am already noticing positive results. Definitely glad I added this to my daily regimen.</li>
    <li> I’ve been using this Collagen Peptide Serum for just over three weeks now and only have high praise for it. I love how it’s lightweight, isn’t greasy at all and just a small amount covers my entire face and neck. My face looks softer and brighter and feels smoother. Works much better than products that are much more expensive. I’m hooked.</li>
    <li> This product has been a very pleasant surprise. Tried it at suggestion of friend, noticed immediate improvement and visible smoothing of lines on cheeks. Does not irritate my very sensitive skin. Customer service also followed up purchase with helpful suggestions for use.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Collagen Peptide Firming Serum by Ouvelle for 7 days and so far i am seeing some improvements. I have fine lines on my forehead I am trying to get rid of. I use it twice a  day on clean skin, it absorbs very fast too.</li>
