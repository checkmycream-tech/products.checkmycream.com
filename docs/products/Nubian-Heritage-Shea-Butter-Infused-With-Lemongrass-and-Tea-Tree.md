    <li> My favorite moisturizer - can&#x27;t live without it.  I have severely dry skin from chronic illness.  It&#x27;s the only thing that works.  I also use as facial moisturizer.  Never causes blemishes bcz of the anti-inflammatory effects of tea tree oil.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice shea butter, soft and easy to spread with a lemony scent.  Excellent for use as a foot cream.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an African American guy who has been trying to find something to moisturize my skin for ages! My skin was starting to look dull. I first heard about Nubian Heritage soaps, I started using them and my skin started showing better results after a week. I still, however, had no way of moisturizing my skin after bathing, because lotions just do not work for me! At one point I was using raw shea butter to moisturize but it was so greasy and it transfered onto everything. I came acrossed Nubian Heritage&#x27;s infused shea butter that matched the soaps that I was using and it worked like magic! All their products compliment each other. The product leaves your skin looking moisturized (not greasy), the smell is amazing, and after a while your skin will start to brighten. I can tell this product will last for a long time, because a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> FANTASTIC, high quality product!  Seems to have anti-inflammatory properties.  My sensitive, oft-razor burned skin was blissfully free of discomfort. Wonderful, fresh scent.</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this infused Shea butter lotion! If you&#x27;ve never tried Nubain products you owe it to yourself to try it! This one smells so good I&#x27;m tempted to taste it! It&#x27;s infused with REAL essential oils and it&#x27;s so good for your skin. I love several other types of the Nubain; the frankincense and myrrh is very good also. TRY IT, YOU&#x27;LL LOVE IT! A little goes a long ways so it last forever.</li>
    <li> Like using shea butter, but this is very solid. It is very hard to get out of container.</li>
    <li> My aunt uses the Nubian Heritage Frankincense and Myrrh, but the fragrance was way too strong for me and my allergies.  So, I ordered this for myself and I love the product and the fragrance.  Entire list of ingredients: shea butter, lemongrass oil, orange oil, and tea tree oil.  The shea butter is waxy, not oily, so my face doesn&#x27;t break out; I usually have to be very careful not to let anything oily get near my face, so finding lotions and hair products that I can use has been a problem.  I use this product on my neck (which has been itchy), hands, elbows and feet.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> First... it smells GREAT. I primarily use it for giving my girlfriend massages. We were using an almond oil which was fine but the shea butter provides more friction which I prefer as it generates more heat in my hands, and it helps me control speed a little better, especially when digging in hard and applying pressure down her back or quads and IT band. It doesn&#x27;t leave us feeling like an oil slick like the almond oil does. No wiping down or shower required afterwards. Her daughter (6.5 years) loves the stuff too and I&#x27;ve actually started using it on a hot spot I get on my shoulder due to lots of hiking (friction from my pack strap).</li>
    <li> Love this company since trying here on Amazon. They make great soaps too. I primarily use these lotions for my feet due to the shea butter making all products a bit greasy but wow what a great aroma and soothing feel for someone who&#x27;s on there feet all day. Obviously put your socks on after applying for optimal effect and so as to not stain your other garments (wardrobe or bed sheets).</li>
    <li> I Love this suffer smell  very good. I will buy again thank you.</li>
    <li> The butter has a very pleasant and delightful smell. Easy to put on lips, nails or hands. This is not a cream, but the consistency is not so hard. The best time to put on your skin is before you are going to bed, because it&#x27;s really buttery. If you have a very dry skin, this is product for you. Love it.</li>
    <li> I tried all Nubian’s butters and this one the best for me.&lt;br /&gt;It smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> This stuff sells amazing. The consistency is great, I have finally found a brand that I will use again</li>
    <li> The advertisement does say 4oz, however I was still surprised by the size of it, in comparison to the price .</li>
    <li> Wonderful smell, very rich and creamy going on. I got it for the itchy rash I have due to a Candida flare. It has tamed the itch considerably. I have been trying to find something to soothe this for over 2 months. I think I finally did- thank you Nubian Heritage, Express Heritage &amp; Amazon for making this available for me to purchase.</li>
    <li> smells soooooooooo  good!  This smells so much better on my skin that the soap!  I Love IT!</li>
    <li> Nice mild smell.  Easy to apply.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Great product, though not creamy and soft it does last longer.</li>
