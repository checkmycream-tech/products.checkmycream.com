      <li>I love the color.  </li>
      <li>This is another favorite OPI shade, of mine.</li>
      <li>but I love it by itself</li>
      <li>kind of a golden peachy/pinky beige.  </li>

      <li>I will certainly buy more colors when needed.</li>
      <li>As usual, the OPI quality is better than any drug store brand out there, and I&#x27;m really happy to have this shade to play with this summer.</li>

      <li>But the consistency is globby, it doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly or even out the way my other OPI colors do.</li>
      <li>Most young polish wearers prefer darker shades today, so i had trouble giving it away.  </li>
      <li>This is such a pretty color.</li>
      <li>This wore without peeling, chippping, or wearing, for nearly two weeks.</li>
      <li>A nice, subtle shade, just not for anyone with red skin undertones.</li>
      <li>I do like the color, it&#x27;s a little more sheer than I usually like, but it seemed like it took forever to be shipped.</li>
