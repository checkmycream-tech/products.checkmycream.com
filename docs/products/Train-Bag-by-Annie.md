      <li>But it is useful.</li>
      <li>and I love that it is clear</li>
      <li>But I just used clear packing tape and it&#x27;s pretty much as good as new.</li>

      <li>Nice bag for cheap price, easy carry and roomy, its nice to throw an ice pack in to keep your food cold.</li>
      <li>Zipper doesnt Zip and comes right off.</li>
      <li>Sturdy, easy to clean and bigger than thought.</li>
      <li>The clear plastic allows light to shine through</li>
      <li>the handles started to rip first now</li>
      <li>Thank you it was exactly what I want</li>
      <li>I probably need Several more of these</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m definitely buying a second one , love it :)</li>
      <li>It is not a heavy plastic, it is light and bendable; which is what I wanted.</li>
      <li>This is exactly what I thought it would be.  </li>
      <li>Junk, the zipper ripped out the first use.</li>
      <li>It did what any normal bag should do - hold sh%@$t in place!!</li>
      <li>For this kind of money it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
      <li>I purchased at the same time the Lexie clear PVC handbag Purse cosmetic container by bag manager and it was more substantial and worth the price.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a medium/small bag of soft plastic and is great for storing something you want to be able to see but not great for regular use as the zipper isn&#x27;t particular user friendly.</li>
      <li>I also purchased the large clear zipper tot by Sachs and such and was pleased with that purchase.</li>
      <li>$1.99 would have been a better price on this item, not very sturdy but usable.</li>
      <li>Realy didnt care much for this bag.</li>
      <li>The kicker is that there are NO RETURNS ON THIS ITEM, which is unusual for Amazon.</li>
      <li>I really like the size and feel of this bag.</li>
      <li>i didn&#x27;t pay much for this.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s not sturdy enough to hold its shape when full.</li>
      <li>Roomy and big enough to fit all my things.  </li>
      <li>Since it is plastic sewn to fabric, it will be prone to ripping (especially if you walk like i do and do exactly &amp;#34;cradle&amp;#34; it)</li>
      <li>The zipper broke the first time I tried to open it.  </li>
      <li>It looks floppy or saggy when full of stuff or empty.</li>
      <li>It was pretty big too, held a large tube of tooth paste, 2 tooth brushes, shampoo and conditioner (regular sized) and a stick of deoderant.</li>
      <li>The plastic is not very thick either.</li>
      <li>however, it is a little cheaply made.  </li>
      <li>IT IS OK, THE ZIPPER IS HARD TO USE.</li>
      <li>so I can see all of its contents clearly.</li>
      <li>I needed a clear bag for work and didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot.  </li>
      <li>flaw is that the zipper is on the flimsy side - so much so that I don&#x27;t expect it to last...</li>
      <li>and the case itself is fine for small or lighter things.</li>
      <li>Small bag good for small items.</li>
      <li>Not great quality but ok for the price</li>
      <li>nice bag but very thin material</li>
      <li>It is not worth the money paid (which wasn&#x27;t much).  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> this bag is great for what i bought it for. however, it is a little cheaply made.  the zipper is not installed properly, so the bag only opens about 1/4 of the way so the best i can give it is three stars.</li>
    <li> It is a great addition to my make up accessories.</li>
    <li> Thank you it was exactly what I want</li>
    <li> Good size,,, happy (;</li>
    <li> Realy didnt care much for this bag. Cant realy say i like or dislike this bag. its just a bag and good for keeping cosmetics.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY.. waste of money!!! It is nearly as thin as a plastic bag and I threw it out!!! Save your money!!</li>
    <li> I picked this bag so my Mother could put her medicines in and be able to carry them to her Doctors appointments.</li>
    <li> Love clear bags! It&#x27;s smaller than I thought, but I still use it all the time!</li>
    <li> I purchased two of these I decided to use one for  napkins and plastic utensils since summer is around the corner and we spend more time outdoors.This little bag is perfect to prevent napkins from blowing off the picnic  table or when we on the boat.Saves alot of Hassel  and the case itself is fine for small or lighter things.Can be used for many purposes, the zipper on mine seems to be ok hasn&#x27;t  got stuck yet.Perfect for what I&#x27;m using this for.</li>
    <li> I bought this to store seed beads and it  work out nicely, in fact I bought 3 of them. Yes I would recommend</li>
    <li> Nice bag for cheap price, easy carry and roomy, its nice to throw an ice pack in to keep your food cold.</li>
    <li> It is good . Just a little smaller than what I expected . The quality is good .  BUt not perfect .</li>
    <li> I use this bag to hold my nail polish. It has held up well and I love that it is clear so I can see all the colors without emptying the entire bag. It also has a handle that works well and supports all the weight of the polish.</li>
    <li> Not very good quality -- looks like something I might have purchased at a dollar tree.</li>
    <li> Small bag good for small items.</li>
    <li> Flimsy bag.  Thin plastic.  I was hoping it was a little thicker.  I can&#x27;t see this bag standing up to travel.</li>
    <li> Roomy and big enough to fit all my things.  It is perfect for carrying your jewelry and easy to find your things since it is see thru.</li>
    <li> Kind of cheap material, but still a good deal for the prize and GOOD size</li>
    <li> perfect for my nieces nail polish collection!</li>
    <li> This is a great bag for my sewing stuff.</li>
    <li> Cute and spacious.  Nice carrying case for your toiletries</li>
    <li> This is a good bag for cosmetics, medical supplies, medications, supplements..... the best part is you can see what you have without opening it.</li>
    <li> Wanted something bigger since I work at a stadium and carry a hoodie for night time plus my personal care stuff but it will do this is big enough to carry some things .buyer beware if your looking for a lunch bag its perfect</li>
    <li> Not happy but than again i didn&#x27;t pay much for this.  Handle already came off.</li>
    <li> If I could give zero stars, I would. The zipper broke the first time I tried to open it.  Threw it away immediately. A Ziploc bag would (and did) work better. It is not worth the money paid (which wasn&#x27;t much).  Don&#x27;t waste a dime on this.</li>
    <li> this bag is realy small may hold a 6 pack of can drinks was realy disapointed when i got it</li>
    <li> I needed a clear bag for work and didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot.  Works great and is holding up !</li>
    <li> holds my sons&#x27; underwear/socks nicely, easy for them to find when traveling!</li>
    <li> Junk, the zipper ripped out the first use. For the price I should have gotten something a whole lot better.</li>
    <li> Bit light on plastic....but great fit for what I needed it for.</li>
    <li> The zipper broke once I filled my bag with 3 items. Glad it happen at home instead of my trip. Don&#x27;t waste your money.the plastic is super thin.</li>
    <li> I bought it to hold my nail polish. It;s nice that it&#x27;s see through. . . . . . .</li>
    <li> I expected it to be longer in length but it isnt. Its alright but it didnt fit all my products i need. im disappointed.</li>
    <li> Ok for the money. I wish the zipper was sturdier or was designed a little differently so I could use the handle on a hook without the zipper coming all the way unzipped.</li>
    <li> Flimsy and the zipper broke after opening it 2 times very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I added some board to the bottom to stiffen it up.  It will work for the few times I need it.  Not great quality but ok for the price</li>
    <li> Zipper doesnt Zip and comes right off. I used it once.....</li>
    <li> it came already with a tear in it cheaply made</li>
    <li> I happen to love this bag. It was perfect for my current knitting project. It is not a heavy plastic, it is light and bendable; which is what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I recently traveled to europe and purchased this bag specifically for the trip. It did what any normal bag should do - hold sh%@$t in place!! It was pretty big too, held a large tube of tooth paste, 2 tooth brushes, shampoo and conditioner (regular sized) and a stick of deoderant. Even with that, 10 days of travel, the case is still in one piece. WOuld def recommend it.</li>
    <li> Heavy duty plastic. I am not worried about this bag not standing up to a heavy load.  I need to carry a clear bag into my retail job and this is the perfect size to keep my lunch, etc. I like that it is wide so my lunch won&#x27;t tip over and spill in the bag.</li>
    <li> Did not like, will not reorder. Very very thin vinyl. Don&#x27;t recommend, ESpecially for the money. Disappointed!! Poor quality.&lt;br /&gt;I got different shape bag also which was same thin quality.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Sturdy, easy to clean and bigger than thought. It fits all my makeup for storage and travel. I love it!</li>
    <li> I thought it would be a larger bag for packing on a plane. I needed a larger size for shampoo conditiioner</li>
    <li> The vinyl should be alittle thicker,and a better zipper.  It&#x27;s ok for very light things.</li>
    <li> It was hard to get a feel for the actual size. It is way too small for what I needed. Practically useless.  The plastic is not very thick either.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift, recipient happy, wanted to use it for her brushes as an extension to her make-up carry-all.</li>
    <li> Since it is plastic sewn to fabric, it will be prone to ripping (especially if you walk like i do and do exactly &amp;#34;cradle&amp;#34; it) the handles started to rip first now there&#x27;s a small rip on the side. But I just used clear packing tape and it&#x27;s pretty much as good as new. Oh the zipper snapper so I added a paper clip to it so i can comfortably zip it. But for 5 dollars it was a really good buy and serves its purpose of holding my work stuff nicely</li>
    <li> IT IS OK, THE ZIPPER IS HARD TO USE.</li>
    <li> This is excellent for storage and very easy to find stuff through the clear plastic.  I probably need Several more of these</li>
    <li> Flimsy - I sent it back!</li>
    <li> Just OK. Zippers are iffy. Size as advertised.</li>
    <li> For this kind of money it&#x27;s not worth it. Think zip lock bags and you&#x27;ll do better than this. So painfully flimsy in trim and clear material.  Don&#x27;t you get ripped off also.  I purchased at the same time the Lexie clear PVC handbag Purse cosmetic container by bag manager and it was more substantial and worth the price. I also purchased the large clear zipper tot by Sachs and such and was pleased with that purchase.</li>
    <li> I use this as a lunch bag. Not real great but wasn&#x27;t built for that. Rather flimsy but suits my purpose.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste the 6 bucks- the zipper was off the runner of the flimsy, single stitched runner.  The kicker is that there are NO RETURNS ON THIS ITEM, which is unusual for Amazon. I could have just thrown the money in the trashcan earlier instead of going through the hassles and still throwing this bag into the trashcan.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with this purchase. It was torn after 6 days of use. I would NOT recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a medium/small bag of soft plastic and is great for storing something you want to be able to see but not great for regular use as the zipper isn&#x27;t particular user friendly. It seems sturdy enough, just that you will not enjoy opening and closing it regularly.</li>
    <li> nice bag but very thin material it wont last real long</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I thought it would be.  I am using it for the purpose I bought it for and am happy with it.</li>
    <li> Smaller than I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> I received this bag in time and it was a little small but the straps broke as I picked it up with markup in it!</li>
    <li> I really like the size and feel of this bag. It is the perfect size - not too big but holds quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;There were no odors upon delivery - nice!&lt;br /&gt;Only flaw is that the zipper is on the flimsy side - so much so that I don&#x27;t expect it to last... hopefully, it surprises me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bit taller and decent zipper would have made this bag near perfect.</li>
    <li> Use as a 3DS bag. My so. Likes seeing what&#x27;s in a bag and his has helped keep a lot of his games from &amp;#34;getting lost&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> $1.99 would have been a better price on this item, not very sturdy but usable.</li>
    <li> I bought this to hold my makeup accessories- make up removers, sponge pads, back up foundation brushes, etc. It&#x27;s not very large but it gets the job done . It&#x27;s quite sturdy and the see-through material saves the trouble of having to search for things . I&#x27;m definitely buying a second one , love it :)</li>
    <li> I think is a little expensive, the zip did not work very well. But it is useful.</li>
    <li> Love the plastic, great to use for my makeup because it wipes off easily. The clear plastic allows light to shine through so I can see all of its contents clearly. My old makeup bag was very dark inside, so this was an affordable update.</li>
    <li> I think this product doesnt have enough thickness or suport. It looks floppy or saggy when full of stuff or empty. wont buy again.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this bag would be a made of a thicker mil plastic but it&#x27;s not sturdy enough to hold its shape when full. The zipper goes one way, rather than having 2 zippers meet in the middle which makes it cumbersome to use. The price point seems high for the poor quality of design and construction.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for, holds all my travel needs very well and easily accessible to find every time.</li>
    <li> It holds a lot for women who have a lot of makeup. The only problem i have is the the plastic is two thing.&lt;br /&gt;So you can not put anything heavy inside of the bag.</li>
