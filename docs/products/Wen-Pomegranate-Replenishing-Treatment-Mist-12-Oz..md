<li> My hair has really been struggling in dry dry california.</li>
<li> mid-day.&lt;br /&gt;The price might seem a little steep, but you don&#x27;t need much to do your hair and face, so it should last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t make my hair go flat like alot of sprays</li>
<li> Swimming and sun have been taking a toll on my hair and this instantly removes any dry ends, humidity frizzies or unwanted waves.  </li>
<li> I thought this product would help revitalize my hair the day after washing it with Wen cleasner, which I love, but it just made it look dirty.  </li>
<li> I love the smell of this mist, I have walked around all day smelling my self like a crazy person</li>
<li> Nothing but Wen for my hair (which is dry).</li>
<li> It just puts moisture back in without weighing anything down or making my curls go</li>
<li> The mist just makes my hair wet.  </li>
<li> and I spray it on wet hair</li>
<li> I cannot and will not live with this product!!</li>
<li> I especially like this finishing mist because it&#x27;s not sticky nor does it leave my hair stiff like the other ones I&#x27;ve tried that are on the market.</li>
<li> I go through this product much faster than I would like to, I also feel that it is expensive.</li>
<li> Not sure whether to blow dry or just leave it.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s helps me keep moisture and definition to their curls in very little time.</li>
<li> did in the past...</li>
<li> My husband even likes it to tame his bed head in the morning!</li>
<li> ( Not so expensive from this vendor, THANK YOU!)  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I thought this product would help revitalize my hair the day after washing it with Wen cleasner, which I love, but it just made it look dirty.  I do spray it on my face.  I don&#x27;t think I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> My hair has really been struggling in dry dry california. This has really brought it back to life! And it is finally able to grow again.</li>
    <li> The pomegranate smells wonderful - and the shine and conditioning are amazing.  Swimming and sun have been taking a toll on my hair and this instantly removes any dry ends, humidity frizzies or unwanted waves.  This is a must have to protect the ends when I use a straightener on my hair! My husband even likes it to tame his bed head in the morning!</li>
    <li> I started using the Wen products about a month ago and love it! I wanted to add more treatment so I purchased the replenishing Treatment mist. I love the smell and I spray it on wet hair and it&#x27;s easy to comb through my hair. Wen products really work!</li>
    <li> Wen makes the best hair care products and this is another great one.  It keeps my hair from frizzing and also keeps it from drying out.  I use it with the intensive oil treatment and it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
    <li> I like this product when I use it on my hair before I straighten it. Other than that I really don&#x27;t get what else to use it for. And if you use too much, it can make your hair greasy...which I DO NOT NEED!</li>
    <li> I found this true to its description. Wouldn&#x27;t be without it. I also spray on my face as a light moisturiser... and my picky skin loves it.    Try it.</li>
    <li> It is wonderful in the A.M. for bed head but it is turning my white hair yellow.  Why I don&#x27;t know but after about 3 applications my hair starts to yellow</li>
    <li> I had ordered the Pomegranate replenishing Mist 12 oz , but received instead  the Tea Tree Mist.&lt;br /&gt;I was disapointed  but I will accept it.&lt;br /&gt;Hope in the future there won&#x27;t be this kind of problem.</li>
    <li> I especially like this finishing mist because it&#x27;s not sticky nor does it leave my hair stiff like the other ones I&#x27;ve tried that are on the market.</li>
    <li> I was worried that this price was too good to be true, but was exactly as described.  I was very pleased.</li>
    <li> My mom put me on to Wen products (Thanks ma). I wash my locs weekly with [[ASIN:B00120VWJ0 Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soaps Pure-Castile Soap, 18-in-1 Hemp Peppermint, 32 Ounce Bottle]]  and the only other styling product I use is the Replenishing mist. It smells nice, moisturizes without build-up and assists in all styling from roller sets to pulled back up dos! If you have Sisterlocks (like me) or Traditional Locs (like my mama) this product is a great tool to have in your arsenal.</li>
    <li> When I get out of the shower I spray the mist on it. I do not use lotions anymore since I started using this and the cleansing lotion. I have curly hair so every morning I use this mist on my hair to freshen the curls. Its a fantastic product!!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this mist, I have walked around all day smelling my self like a crazy person cuz it smells that good.  I use the wen cleansing conditioner so this is a great addition to the process.  It has made my hair feel great throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I love this product!! It smells amazing, and really adds softness to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great to use between washings to add moisture back in.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t make my hair go flat like alot of sprays did in the past...it supports my style nicely without any hold or anything...It just puts moisture back in without weighing anything down or making my curls go flat.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great for your face too..sets makeup and freshens you up mid-day.&lt;br /&gt;The price might seem a little steep, but you don&#x27;t need much to do your hair and face, so it should last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I really am surprised at how much body it gives my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Another can&#x27;t live without product from Wen :)</li>
    <li> I have used wen for a long time, this producted is great. AND the prices is wonderful here.  they have quick shipments too , i could not beleive it.  thank you.</li>
    <li> Second time I&#x27;ve purchased this product. I use it every day. Great for curly hair. Refreshes the curls every morning.</li>
    <li> The mist just makes my hair wet.  Not sure whether to blow dry or just leave it.  No so great</li>
    <li> I&#x27;VE been using only Wen products for 5 years and this 12oz is only available on QVC in a TSV kit or specials they have that sell out immediately! I cannot and will not live with this product!! I use it after cleansing, putting my Wen leave in and styling cream in. It makes your hair even softer, defines curls Luke no other product I used before starting Wen and I carry a 2oz bottle in my purse to spray on my face as a pick me up refresher and I use it as my face toner and it leaves your skin clean, soft and moisturized!!  A MUST HAVE ladies!!</li>
    <li> junk,..didnt work well for my hair i wont rebuy this...what is it that many american&#x27;s like Pomegranite and mint and lavender and oranges!!?? yeuck!!!!</li>
    <li> I faithfully use this product on my 7yr old twin daughters. They have very curly (and thirsty) hair that if not careful, can be a pain to maintain and keep healthy. This product is great! I use this on the days in between cleansing their hair with Wen&#x27;s cleansing conditioner. It&#x27;s helps me keep moisture and definition to their curls in very little time. Now styling and keeping their hair healthy regularly isn&#x27;t as difficult as it used to be. PS, I also use a little on my son&#x27;s hair to make it more manageable to brush as well. I&#x27;m definitely hooked! :)</li>
    <li> I love this WEN product to boost my hair when I don&#x27;t wash it, and I love to spray my face with it after putting on my makeup.  It seems to add moisture and sets it for the whole day.  Wonderful fragrance.</li>
    <li> I go through this product much faster than I would like to, I also feel that it is expensive. ( Not so expensive from this vendor, THANK YOU!)  It is nice to have in the event your hair is fizzy and you need to moisturize it without messing up your hair after it has been styled.</li>
    <li> I love all of Wen&#x27;s products, and have used nothing but Wen for over 6 years.  Nothing but Wen for my hair (which is dry).</li>
    <li> I really got this replenishing mist because of dry hair, but found out it is amazing on your skin too. This is an awesome product!</li>
