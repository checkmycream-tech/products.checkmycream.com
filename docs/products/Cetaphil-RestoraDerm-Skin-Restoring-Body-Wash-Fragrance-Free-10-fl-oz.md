<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do much for my eczema, but my eczema is internally induced. I also didn&#x27;t feel as clean.</li>
    <li> This is the best body wash I have ever purchased. My skin feels very smooth after I apply this to my body.</li>
    <li> Great if you want to smell like a hippy. No noticeable skin benefits after giving it a chance. Pass</li>
    <li> This stuff is the stuff!  You still may need a little lotion but as body washes go, it makes you feel soft and clean.</li>
    <li> Works amazingly for my eczema. I would totally recommend for a friend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a few times. It&#x27;s NOT really unscented though. I&#x27;m not sure how long I have to use in order to see some result, but in the time I used it, I didnt&#x27; see any improvements.</li>
    <li> I received samples of Cetaphil Restoraderm Body Wash and Body Lotion last September. I was looking for a solution for my multiple skin problems. I have scleroderma, acne, eczema, rosacea, and keratosis. My kids have very sensitive skin and eczema, and my husband has itchy, bumpy, sensitive skin. Before we tried this, the kids were using Mustela, my husband was using fragrance-free Aveeno body wash, and I was using Neutrogena. We were all getting by, but our symptoms were still bad. Once I switched to using the body wash and the lotion, my skin was CLEAR in two weeks. I soon switched the whole family over. While it costs more than anything else we&#x27;ve used per ounce, we&#x27;ve saved it by not seeing the dermatologist as much. It uses chemical exfoliating, gentle ingredients, and light moisturizers to turn over the skin cells faster. This improves the health of your skin while keeping it protected. It works better than any other products I tried. I suggest using one bottle of the wash and the lotion. I think you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> There are various triggers for eczema, and none are fun. With the type of work I do and the need to be clean to avoid any of the triggers, this helps out at the end of the day to feel clean and aids a lot with the itching associated with eczema. One thing I&#x27;ve noticed over the course of using it, is that it tends to leave the skin a bit dry. Nothing crazy, but particularly with areas where eczema is or where you are treating it.&lt;br /&gt;A good moisturizer is key here to help with it. I noticed immediately improvement using this with Aveeno for Eczema, as the cetaphil moisturizer for eczema tends to dry out my skin too. Not major, but enough for me to want to use a moisturizer like Aveeno.</li>
    <li> I have not been used,but I think it should be good.</li>
    <li> After finding that Cetaphil&#x27;s liquid gentle cleanser as well as its antibacterial bar were too drying for my skin, I tried the Restoraderm formula without much hope.  I was pleasantly surprised. I consider this body wash a key part of my eczema management regimen.  Although steroid creams, oral antihistamines, and moisturizing remain necessary, I find that outbreaks requiring topical treatment are less frequent than they were before I switched to the Restoraderm. If you decide to try it, I hope it works as well (or better) for you.</li>
    <li> This wash is very soothing and relaxing. Light and easy on the pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it is certainly a good body wash, it didn&#x27;t help with my eczema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Solid product, but no guarantees it will remedy your eczema.</li>
    <li> The product came to me well and on time, without any problem, I&#x27;m already using and it works perfectly, totally recommend.</li>
    <li> The Cetaphil Restoraderm lotion and body wash were prescribed to use for my baby&#x27;s eczema. We also had an initial Rx cream (more like an oil) that we used at first to get his eczema under control, but it was extremely messy and had a lot of warnings on the label that scare you when applying to an infant! We use this body wash for each bath (along with the lotion afterwards) and he rarely ever has an eczema flair up any longer. I am so glad I found this online because I had a really tough time finding it in a store, and the doctor said it had to be the Restoraderm name, not just regular Cetaphil.  Do note that on the back of each of the bottles is a $2 off coupon for the lotion (and vise versa, a coupon for the bodywash on the back of the lotion), which you could use in-store if you can find it.</li>
    <li> My son had very sensitive skin when he was a baby and the pediatrician recommended this soap for his skin. It definitely helped with his dry patches of skin and had a nice clean smell to it.</li>
    <li> This is the only body wash that doesn&#x27;t irritate my daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin.  Buy it on amazon for $4 less than Walgreen&#x27;s or Walmart! Great :O)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had eczema for 40 years and this product was recommended by my dermatologist.  It is working great this winter.</li>
    <li> Works well. Though I do prefer aveenos fragrance free bodywash to this, for my eczema.</li>
    <li> I have mild psoriasis and this body wash seems to work well with my skin. It doesn&#x27;t help remove any scaling but doesn&#x27;t aggravate at all either.</li>
    <li> I have scalp psoriasis (a autoimmune condition that causes scaly dry skin and can be aggravated by normal soaps and shampoos) I was prescribed a steroid ointment for my condition which did end up working...until I ran out and it set me back $50. I decided to try something else and I had heard good things about cetaphil for eczema and dermatitis problems so I gave this new product a shot. My head was a big red scaly mess and I was losing hair so I had nothing else to lose. I have use both the restoraderm lotion and the body wash for a month (yes on my scalp) and I am symptom free. I can&#x27;t say enough about how well it works.</li>
    <li> Good enough but still think there&#x27;s just too much chemicals for someone with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This product is a miracle! My skin normally feels &amp;#34;scratchy&amp;#34; due to having eczema. During the winter months it gets worse. After using this body wash, my skin feels soft like a baby and retains moisture. This body wash lathers nicely and leaves my body clean. My skin no longer feels scratchy or irritated. This product does have a slight scent but it wears off after you shower. I also use the Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream in conjunction with this body wash for maximum results.</li>
    <li> Helps my dry skin, wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey</li>
    <li> Really helps with dry skin.  Lathers up really well also.  It has no fragrance, which I really appreciate.</li>
    <li> My eczema was stop itching after first using this body wash along with the moisturizer. at the second day, the eczema/break out was getting better. it is really nice product, really fast. although the smell is little wired.</li>
    <li> I have issues with eczema, and this has been perfect for it.  My skin is not nearly as dry as it used to be. This body wash has a very slight lather, which I find easier to use than moisturizing washes that don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Cetaphil Restoraderm was recommended to us by my daughter&#x27;s allergist (she&#x27;s two). The Restoraderm system has left her so incredibly soft and completely unlike her splotchy, rough baby pictures. We tried so many products (as have I, I have extremely sensitive skin) and this is the stuff that really works! She now only rarely uses cortisone cream.  Update: After using for one year, I still swear by this skin wash. I&#x27;m a little mixed on the lotion. My daughter has recently complained of \\&quot;ouchies\\&quot; after using the lotion on her flare-ups. I switched to an old standby, Vanicream (about as plain a lotion as you can get), and her skin is perfect.   Another remedy that we accidentally stumbled upon is putting baking soda in the bath. We use about 1/4 cup for a full bathtub. Her doctor recommended it for a yeast infection but it had the added benefit of soothing her skin.</li>
    <li> I have to echo the other gal who said her 2 yr old&#x27;s eczema disappeared after using this stuff.  I also have a blotchy, dry-skinned 2 yr old and it doesn&#x27;t help that we live in a really dry climate. He&#x27;s always scratching and has unsightly patches on his arms and legs.  For a while, cortisone cream worked well but I guess the body acclimates to it or something and it is no longer effective.  Well the gal that works at my boy&#x27;s daycare said that another one of the little eczema kids who attends there just started using this stuff with great results.  So I sprang and shelled out the thirteen bucks at the grocery store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it directly in the bath water like bubble bath (sadly, it didn&#x27;t produce bubbles so that was kind of a bummer for the boy) and when he came out 15 minutes later, I noticed a pronounced immediate difference.  The blotches hadn&#x27;t disappeared after just one use, but his overall skin tone was much creamier and less aggravated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He&#x27;s now used it twice and it&#x27;s just such a relief to have found something that, at long last, is making a difference.  I&#x27;m gonna get the lotion too and see how much better he&#x27;ll be with the addition of that step to his regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bravo!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;June 2012 UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to provide this update for parents who are seeking help for their kids&#x27; sensitive skin.  While this product did work beautifully at first, prompting my 5-star review, its efficacy was short-lived.  After a handful of baths, the blotchy patches reappeared.  The Cetaphil seemed completely ineffective when used regularly.  It still seems to help in a very short-term way, but only if I limit its use.  It&#x27;s almost like his body adapts and defends against the healing agent in this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that I have had months-long good luck giving my child a combination of Omega-3 gummies along with probiotic gummies (as per pediatrician recommendation).  It hasn&#x27;t cured the sensitive skin problem completely but it&#x27;s worked for about six months in a much more significant way than any other things I&#x27;ve tried before.ed for about six months in a much more significant way than any other things I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
    <li> I disliked the smell.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin like soap does.  a bottle lasts longer than I thought (a few months).</li>
    <li> Good stuff! I use this for my hands and scalp and it really helps with irritation. The skin on my hands hasn&#x27;t cracked and bled since I&#x27;ve been using it. I get scalp bumps and this seems to help with the problem. I have also mixed the product with other natural shampoos.</li>
    <li> I ordered two bottles of this.  One for my mom&#x27;s birthday, and one for me to try for myself.  It lathers like bar soap, but I didn&#x27;t mind that.  I saw a dramatic improvement in the eczema on my arm the next morning, which I am positively thrilled about.  My only problem is that, based on other reviews here, I expected there to be no difference between eczema with broken skin, or just the rash.  I have several blotches of eczema on my legs, which have open sores from scratching and a very jumpy dog.  While I do acknowledge the dog is part of the problem with curing my legs, and that the blotches that haven&#x27;t opened up to look like nasty mosquito bites are healing nicely, I was a little disappointed to see that the worst of the problem on my legs doesn&#x27;t seem to be responding as well as the many times larger rash on my arm.  Still, this is very helpful and very soothing, and I have been able to use it on my dried out face with no problem, so I would definitely reccommend it as well as get more for myself.  As far as delivery was concerned, it took longer than, and yet not as long as I expected.  I was told shortly after placing my order that the product was out of stock, and I could change my order, cancel it altogether, or give permission to have it on backorder til it could be filled.  I was surprised and pleased with this, because usually my orders from anywhere get cancelled if they are out of stock.  It arrived a week later, when I was prepared to have it the following Wednesday after that, due to the need of restocking the bodywash.  The store kept me informed, answered my questions, and politely apologized for the delay.</li>
    <li> My son has very sensitive skin and we are battling his eczema. This has truly helped us keep him cleaning without agitating his skin.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist and does what it says.  I have very sensitive skin and this is helpful in maintaining it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product hoping my son would get some relief from his eczema. He has extremely senstivr skin. It actually made it worse after using it once. It dried his skin out so much.</li>
    <li> Best thing I&#x27;ve used for eczema so far in regards to body wash.</li>
    <li> I love this body wash. Helps with itchy dry skin. Will buy again for sure.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin to products that have fragrance or dyes in them.  With regular products I get out of the shower and feel like my skin is on fire.  Same after shaving my legs.  Not a good feeling.  I have always used Cetaphil facial wash with great sucesss!  After finding the Cetaphil Body Wash it has made taking a shower not a painful experience.  I highly recommend this product for people with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Found that getting this on Amazon saved a lot of money from drug stores, and need it for very dry skin. Lathers nicely and feels clean while still be gentle to dry and sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Our little one had tiny rashes on her body. Our ped suggested this and it works wonders for our daughter. We have been using this for the past few months without any complaints.</li>
    <li> A good product for eczema prone skin. The cleanser is gentle and it works best if you follow it up with the Restoraderm moisturizer. Totally recommended for dry skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of lotions and body washes but this is the only one that provides relief to my super dry and itchy skin brought about by a change in weather. The doctor has diagnosed my skin problems are atopic dermatitis. Cetaphil Restoraderm body wash and moisturizing lotion has been my savior.</li>
    <li> This cleared up the eczema on my son&#x27;s scalp after 2 uses. The skin on his body has also cleared up, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s from the use of this product (which I think had a part in the clearing) or him just growing out of it. Great product (especially because the price is so much cheaper than other brands) and I will now start using it on my little girl to try and clear up her eczema.</li>
    <li> I am just now recovering from an allergic reaction, which seems to have been caused by Cetaphil Restoraderm Body Wash.  My skin became red and inflammed (more than usual) and the inflammed areas started weeping fluid after using this body wash for a few days.  I am now in the process of recovering with the aid of a pound of steroid cream.  Personally I won&#x27;t be using this product any more.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have eczema, but I have dry skin on my legs that gets really itchy. I was hoping that this would moisturize my skin, but I didn&#x27;t feel much difference with it.  Still need to put the lotion on right away.</li>
    <li> Really like it, my dermatologist ask I try it. It&#x27;s just too expensive to use when I shower twice a day. Wish it would come in a larger size at a cheaper price.</li>
    <li> At one time, my itchy arms and legs were so out of control, I had open sores and scratches all over. I also had scars from them. Dark, ugly scars. I have been using this body wash exclusively (with the Restoraderm lotion) for about a year and a half, and it has changed my skin. I never have eczema flares anymore. No more scratches, no more open sores, and the best part: No scars. I&#x27;m serious. I don&#x27;t know how, but this body wash has faded my dark purplish scars from repeat scratching of skin that was constantly irritated. I would recommend this to anybody that is having skin problems. Good luck!</li>
    <li> I have trouble with itching skin.  This product was recommended to me by my dermotologist and I like it a great deal.</li>
    <li> I live in Las Vegas and the winters here are brutally dry.  My skin would get so dry I would itch and get hives.  This body wash solved my dry skin issues.  Great!</li>
    <li> Be sure to notice the dark blue National Eczema Association badge on the front and the words &#x27;Filaggrin technology\\&quot; in the description!  These body washes and lotions really work BUT the other very similar bottles, without the badge are much less effective! So if you have really bad Eczema or Ichthyosis, be sure to get the right ones!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t foam to much and doesn&#x27;t have an odor. So it&#x27;s hard to know if it is working or not.</li>
    <li> Have been using for baby bath since she was 3 months... Love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Melts onto skin on contact and no harsh fragrances for delicate baby skin</li>
    <li> best for eczema and dry skin, newborns up to adults.  our dermatologist recommended it and we LOVE it. been using on whole family for two years now.</li>
    <li> Only product that helps with psoriasis that isn&#x27;t prescription</li>
    <li> Great product... highly recommended for sensitive skins. This product was recommended by the dermatologist for my mom and she loves it !!!!</li>
    <li> I was for introduced to this wash from my daughters pediatrician. He gave me a few samples. I loved it. I suffer from skin sensitivity. I just used it on my face tonight and loved it. Great wash for sensitive skin, rashes ect. I am so happy there is a inexpensive product out there for people with problem skin.</li>
    <li> The skin is much better after a few weeks of application. I apply twice a day.</li>
    <li> I love it, but too expensive!</li>
    <li> Our dermatologist specifically recommended this product for my two-year-old son&#x27;s dry skin/eczema. Rather than give him a bath with regular Johnson &amp; Johnson&#x27;s baby wash, I lather this on him in the tub and rinse with water. It has helped his sensitive skin tremendously. We follow this up with Cetaphil cream after the bath and it greatly reduces the need for any prescription ointment. I have not been disappointed with any Cetaphil product yet. This is a high quality product, gentle on the skin and fragrance free. I will continue to use it with my boys to take care of their skin.</li>
    <li> Burns my skin instead of healing it.  Sorry</li>
    <li> The skin problems that I have been having were awful!&lt;br /&gt;between this product and Zinc I am finally healing.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon customer your reviews about this&lt;br /&gt;Had me try it.  Who knew life could be so itch free and clear.&lt;br /&gt;:-)</li>
    <li> This is a great product, my grandbaby  can&#x27;t use any of the normal soaps for babies, this is perfect, been using it since he was born, almost 2 now</li>
    <li> I am using this product along with the body lotion on my son and am thrilled with the results!!! His skin showed an almost immeadiate improvement. The only suggestion I have is when using it on a child, regulate the ammount they use so the bottle is not gone in a week.</li>
    <li> the only thing that has worked for my daughter! i brought every other over the counter wash and nothing worked until now!</li>
    <li> I love it. I bought it for my two year old granddaughter who has eczema. It is working well her skin is healing and feels so soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to compile a \\&quot;Holy Grail\\&quot; list of products that my overly-sensitive, bad-natured, hissy-fit-having skin agrees with for a very long time now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very oily, very hyper-sensitive skin that has never responded to any prescription treatments from doctors or dermatologists.  And if that isn&#x27;t enough, I also suffer from what has been diagnosed as Cholinergic Urticaria (scratches appearing on skin after sweating..i.e..from exercising or whatever) and Dermographism, where long, welt-like scratches will present themselves on my back, arms and neck for no apparent reason and at any given time. The scratches look as if someone/something has attacked my skin with a vengence. Needless to say, the breakouts causes terrible stinging, burning, raised and inflamed skin and leaves the most unsightly marks after each episode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the days when these conditions occur (they are not food-related that I can see), forget about being able to take a bath or shower or allowing water and especially soap on the skin because it can really hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After having success with Cetaphil&#x27;s bar soap and moisturizing cream, I decided to try the Restoraderm Skin Restoring Body Wash after seeing it on sale at Target.  And, boy, am I glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only has my skin lost that tight, parched, and itchy feeling, but many of the old scratch marks from years ago on my back and arms seem to be lightening up and fading as well. And while I am not confortable saying that a product has \\&quot;cured\\&quot; my skin afflictions, Restoraderm has done more than I ever imagined could happen. The frequency of the breakouts has also changed, and when they do come, the swellings and irritation is very minor and slight and the skin returns to normal quickly without the red welts and scratches ever forming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sincere thanks to Cetaphil! And, yeah, this stuff does cost an arm and a leg, but in my opinion, it&#x27;s worth every single penny.  I&#x27;m just so happy to finally be able to add another item to my very, very short list of \\&quot;HG\\&quot; skincare products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prosperity and peace to all!ry, very short list of \\&quot;HG\\&quot; skincare products.      Prosperity and peace to all!</li>
    <li> I have itchy dry skin that nothing seems to help. I started using this the Restoraderm products and have found relief! This is a great body wash as it lathers nicely and has a clean smell!</li>
    <li> great stuff, will reorder</li>
    <li> Like it and will reorder</li>
    <li> My baby&#x27;s skin was feeling like sandpaper because he got dry so easily, no matter how much lotion I used and \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; baby products.  My pediatrician recommended switching to this and we have had zero issues since then.  His skin is super soft now, just like a baby&#x27;s skin should be!</li>
    <li> This product worth every pennies.I have eczema for 20 years. I had tried many medicine but the eczema was just gone and came back after several days. My back was ruined with bunch of scratches. After two weeks using Ceptahill body wash, the scars on my back are fading and I don&#x27;t feel itchy anymore.</li>
    <li> Really help me skin feels soft and soothing</li>
    <li> I have been using Cetaphil for about 3 months now on my 6 month old son. He has eczema on his face, neck, folds of his arms &amp; legs. We started with the bar soap &amp; now are using this. Both work great, no matter which I use, but I like this liquid better because there&#x27;s less soap residue left over to clean up in his little tub. We&#x27;ve had no problems with him having a rash on his skin which is also very sensitive to perfumes. It has been hard getting his skin to clear, but with Cetaphil &amp; All Free &amp; Clear detergent his skin is clear &amp; flare ups are minor compared to before we started using Cetaphil.&lt;br /&gt;I also have sensitive skin &amp; dry out extremely bad in heat or cold, so i also use the bar soap &amp; this lotion on my face (no more dry skin!)&lt;br /&gt;My sons ped prescribed hydrocortizone cream for his flare ups but he cries when I put it on his cheeks, so 2 times a day I use this lotion all over his body including scalp. He doesn&#x27;t cry anymore, so I am guessing it is very gentle &amp; does not burn at all the way the prescription cream does.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend. It takes time battling eczema, but these products are well worth using.</li>
    <li> Seems to be healing my husbands skin issues. Will buy more!</li>
    <li> I have outrageously, embarrassingly sensitive skin. Babies would laugh at the lengths I have to go to keep my skin from itching or turning reddish or blotching up or what have you. So I buy products like this, especially for sensitive, girly skin like mine. And I&#x27;m a GUY.  The problem here is that it may be *too* light and airy and gentle. I&#x27;ve tried a washcloth, a sponge, and a loofa, and getting this stuff to lather up is a chore in and of itself. And I don&#x27;t wanna do chores while I&#x27;m in the shower. I shower to take care of my body after already having DONE chores. The soap itself is so watery and thin that it&#x27;s never easy to get all sudsy when I need it, which is kind of important to me while bathing, y&#x27;know.  Once you do finally, somehow, get your suds going, it&#x27;s a very good, very gentle soap with essentially zero smell to it. That amazed me, as even \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; soaps often have that telltale soapy fragrance to them afterwards. Not here. It does as advertised... eventually.  To summarize: No smell. No harsh feeling. No itch. And no suds without a whole lot of elbow grease.</li>
    <li> It works really good for dry skin. I do not tolerate strong scents in my body products and this was OK, little, not bothering smell.</li>
    <li> So based on previous reviews first I would like to say even hypo allergenic products can have allergic reactions in some. This didn&#x27;t occur with me. Also to the previous review that said this product doesn&#x27;t lather easily; I used a puff and it lathered immediately however for the sake of this review i did also try it with just my hand and it was also fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being covered I have used this product for about 2 weeks and LOVE it. My skin is noticeably softer!</li>
    <li> I have troubling eczema on my face and have been searching endlessly for something that will tame it. Alas, my search continues as this is not the right product for me. I used this product just a few times on my face and it dried out my skin terribly, making my face feel incredibly tight and irritated. I used its lotion counterpart which then felt as if I had lit my face on fire. In the product&#x27;s defense, it does say body wash and not facial cleanser so I&#x27;ll give it an extra star to account for my \\&quot;misuse\\&quot; of the product. Perhaps it works fine as a body-only wash, but I didn&#x27;t try as my eczema is limited to my face. But do beware if you want to use this on your face.</li>
    <li> Well, all babies have sensitive skin. They are babies. This is very mild and is wonderful on our baby&#x27;s skin. But it is not tear free so it will sting if it gets into eyes. We started using it as dermatologist recommended it. Pricey, but works great and lasts very long. Mine lasted about 5 months. If you can&#x27;t afford this, I recommend using [[ASIN:B00005NAOJ Cetaphil Gentle Cleansing Bar - 4.5 oz]] ($5) but don&#x27;t use those baby soaps with sweet scents, especially Johnsons baby soaps. They are so harsh on baby skin. All pediatricians say this.</li>
    <li> Having had excema for a few months, I had to find procucts that increase skin moisture. A sample of this body wash was given to me by my Dermatologist. It worked well in moisturizing my skin without leaving a residue and even though I no longer have excema, I continue using this body wash to keep hydrated.</li>
    <li> My skin is beyond dry.  This is a life saver for me.  I highly recommend it!  My grandson uses it too.  He said, &amp;#34;my skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight, light its going to rip any more and it doesn&#x27;t make me all sticky!&amp;#34;  That pretty much says it all.</li>
    <li> This makes your skin feel wonderful, hydrated and no more itches. Hoping it works as well in winter when cold dry air arrives.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent! My skin is in better condition than it has been in years.  Cetaphil Restoraderm is definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful products.&lt;br /&gt;Which is hardly seen in my country.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to anyone with Eczema to use this product.&lt;br /&gt;Really can see the effect within 1 week.</li>
    <li> Stops the itch, on the skin, its a good product I like to use in the shower</li>
    <li> Teenager has dry skin. Really likes this</li>
    <li> I love Cetaphil Restoraderm Eczema Calming Body wash, it leaves my baby skin smooth. But have not seen change on his skin color. My son have a skin decolortion that&#x27;s what I call it. His doctor called it infanter eczema and she recommended Cetaphil.</li>
    <li> My son has exema and this product clears it up quickly! Highly recommend for babies with sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> so far i have been using this for a few weeks and noticeable difference in my skin after my shower- im no longer feeling like my skin is itchy or suffering from my derm condition quite so much and here it is cold and snowy in the north east right now when i would be suffering real bad so im thankful i found this and its working.</li>
    <li> I buy this product a lot! Great condition! Works great for my sons eczema! Arrives on time! Cleared up my son in just a few days.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this and it works really well. It&#x27;s the best body lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Super Fast Shipping!! Great product!</li>
    <li> I love this body wash very much and use it on a daily basis, I received the it with the lid broken and the content spilled all over in the plastic. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the delivery people who made that mess, but when it comes to theproduct  itself, it does the job it&#x27;s supposed to do and I&#x27;ll definitely order another one soon.</li>
    <li> I used to love all the different fragrances you could get with a body wash, but I developed a terrible rash from something.  I could never identify the offending product, so the dermatologist recommended Cetaphil.  I stopped using all the perfumed body washes and used just the Cetaphil and the rash went away.  Leaves your skin feeling clean, but not dry or tight.</li>
    <li> This body wash together with Cetaphil Restoraderm lotion really works great on my 4 month old. She rarely breaks out after daily use. I would highly recommend this product to anyone that has eczema.</li>
    <li> I like that it feels moist on my skin when put it on.  It also has this moisture feeling left on the skin after use.</li>
    <li> Body wash is better than I expected. I didn&#x27;t think it would lather up like other products, but it lathers up very well.</li>
    <li> Almost 18 months ago, a dermatologist did a &#x27;just in case&#x27; punch biopsy, to evaluate a now-known-to-be-essentially-nothing bump of skin on my upper arm.  What the dermatologist failed to mention (beforehand, let alone ever) was that the apathetically gouged site could subsequently involve a rather prominent (&amp; atypical-looking, in my experience) scar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The site ended up looking like a section of dark red, freshly assaulted/gouged skin (complete with little darker red &#x27;spots&#x27;, presumably associated with an aspect of my blood supply), surrounded by a raised dark red &#x27;halo&#x27; of skin.  Being located in the front of my upper arm, I was conscious of how obvious this would appear if I were in a short-sleeved, let alone sleeveless, top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t wait for this thing to &#x27;heal&#x27;, or at least get to whatever &#x27;final state&#x27; it was capable of achieving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was careful to keep it clean &amp; moistened initially, &amp; then to allow it to be exposed to air, to continue healing.  I used a vitamin E + aloe gel that had worked wonders with my skin previously, &amp; had helped the skin of a relative&#x27;s surgery incision sites heal to an extent that resulted in comments being made during a subsequent follow-up visit, in which the exceptional nature of the healing was noted &amp; commented on by a few members of the staff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel did nothing to produce any form of noticeable change to my punch biopsy site, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely nothing that I tried seemed to result in any improvement to the biopsy site.  It kept right on looking as though it were only a few weeks past the onset of raw damage.  The dark red kept right on staying dark red, &amp; the skin surrounding the &#x27;punch&#x27;/excavation kept right on looking the same, day after day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up going back to that dermatologist, several months post-biopsy, to inquire as to if/when the skin damage caused by such biopsies ever heals, or otherwise changes in a way that results in it no longer looking like a &#x27;fresh extraction&#x27; had recently been made.  Once again, said dermatologist&#x27;s apathetic &amp; dismissive attitude neither disclosed nor explained anything, let alone was of any use or comfort (the dermatologist clearly couldn&#x27;t have cared less).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then a year went by -- still no improvement.  I&#x27;d never encountered such an oddly &#x27;stubborn&#x27; form of skin damage (&amp; it still wasn&#x27;t looking like a scar yet).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although Cetaphil Restoraderm appears to be developed &amp; marketed for atopic conditions, &amp; especially eczema, it dawned on me, after pondering the literal &#x27;breakdown&#x27; of the term &#x27;restoraderm&#x27;, that maybe (it was a worth a shot) it could help in the healing of the odd perma-raw -like biopsy aftermath (if it helped in ANY way, it would be an improvement, &amp; would be appreciated).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am stunned to report that after only 3 exposures of this miracle lotion-y &#x27;body wash&#x27; (whatever it is, it&#x27;s amazing) to the skin in question, &amp; over the course of just under 2 weeks (after using it each time, I waited a few days before using it again, to see if I could notice any improvement [&amp; I could]), the Restoraderm has made not only a noticeable difference, but a truly remarkable improvement to both &#x27;sections&#x27; of concern (the dark red &amp; raw-looking interior, &amp; the different-shade-of-red &#x27;halo&#x27; that surrounds the interior &#x27;rawness&#x27;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &#x27;red&#x27; of the halo is noticeably less red, &amp; beginning to blend in, shade-wise, with the normal skin adjacent to it.  Additionally, the interior aspect is looking less &#x27;raw&#x27;, is a noticeably lighter red, &amp; importantly, an annealing is finally taking place between the skin of the &#x27;halo&#x27; &amp; the punch-excavated &#x27;interior&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still can&#x27;t believe that after all this time, nothing I used (let alone time, itself) resulted in anything that even remotely would compare to what 3 relatively brief exposures to Restoraderm (less than a minute of rubbing in the lotion-like body wash each time [&amp; for the record, I applied it to wet skin (I simply did so with whatever water existed on my arm at the end of a shower)]), &amp; over the course of just under 2 weeks (after next-to-nothing having happened over the previous nearly 18 months).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I realize that I&#x27;ll very likely still have some sort of scar, of some kind, after Restoraderm finishes helping the healing go to whatever limit is possible with such, I am, regardless, a bit beside myself with shock &amp; relief that Restoraderm has been able to make ANY difference, let alone such noticeably positive improvements to the healing of my biopsy site.  The stunning turnaround in healing of this seemingly stubborn section of injured skin has, quite frankly, blown my mind a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Understandably, I am beyond pleased with this product -- I&#x27;m downright stunned by it.  As a teen, another Cetaphil product was the only thing I could use to clean the super-sensitive skin on my face.  I grew up not having to contend with or otherwise consider special skin care products for anything but my sensitive facial skin.  As an adult, Cetaphil Restoraderm is now a game-changer in my skin care arsenal (I&#x27;ve also used it to address an atopic reaction to a cleaning product that left the back of my hands red &amp; &#x27;raw&#x27; -- I used it on non-wet skin, &amp; left it in [I realize that it&#x27;s officially considered a Body Wash, but I intentionally utilized it as though it were a lotion -- &amp; overnight, it worked magic]).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an outstanding product.  Thank you Galderma.</li>
    <li> This product used along with coconut oil cleared up my son&#x27;s cradle cap and baby acne. His skin is super soft...even his doctor commented on how nice his skin is doing.</li>
    <li> My husband has severe eczema his whole life and allergies. This is the ONLY thing he likes. We have tried them all from aveeno, cetaphil, aquaphor and many others.&lt;br /&gt;Suds up nice and is very gentle.</li>
    <li> First off let me start by saying I developed a horrible skin rash in the 6th grade. It got worse once I hit high school. Doctors were prescribing a bunch of nonsense to me and it never cured the ugly rash. Then finally I went to see a REAL dermatologist. She percribed Cetaphil to me. And I lie to you not I noticed my face starting to clear up. My skin looked more radiant felt baby soft and I was amazed. I&#x27;m so happy I came across this product. I will continue to use it for the rest of my life. I&#x27;m so satisfied with my skin. No need to feel ashamed or embarrassed anymore. Cetaphil is Gold!!!!</li>
    <li> I have keratosis pilaris on my arms and legs and this helps from drying my skin out too much.</li>
    <li> The only thing that works for my son&#x27;s sensitive skin. It all depends, I guess.</li>
    <li> The product is excellent and has helped to reduce my current problem. Excellent results, and I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Our Dermatologist recommended this for my daughter that has had eczema her whole life. We&#x27;ve tried everything. She hates lotions that leaves her skin feeling heavy and greasy. This one doesn&#x27;t. She keeps telling me this. A little pricey. I bought it at 14.99 and now see that its 12 something. Not really happy about that.</li>
    <li> My brother has sensitivity to almost every soap out there. Everything irritates his skin and leave it flaky and dry. But not this body wash. This was a God&#x27;s sent for him, he&#x27;s very pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> Leaves my baby&#x27;s skin very smooth and took care of her minor eczema. I saw results within a week or so of using this.</li>
    <li> This has really helped with my daughters itchy eczema skin. I will continue to order.</li>
    <li> I .LOVE THIS STUFF!!!!</li>
    <li> Great for sensitive skin</li>
    <li> We use this for my husbands eczema. He cant shower with any other soap they sting and burn too much. So this has been a Godsend!</li>
    <li> (I posted this for the Restoraderm cream, but thought it would be helpful here as well!!)  My son was diagnosed with eczema last month. We tried everything to help his skin stay moist and to keep his skin from getting further irritated. Most everything else was way too greasy or it didn&#x27;t last long enough to moisturize his skin well. After asking the pharmacist if there was something better, she recommended Cetaphil. I was skeptical because everything else we had bought that says its for eczema and accepted by the NEA either was too greasy or just didn&#x27;t work. But, I figured I had already spent tons in other products, what&#x27;s one more? Well, I tell you.. after using this, along with the cleanser at night, for two days (plus a steroid in the REALLY bad spots), his dry patches are almost GONE. His cradle cap has completely cleared up as well. I won&#x27;t buy anything else now. We&#x27;re going to let his carelady use the old lotion (Aveeno Baby for Eczema) during the day for now just to finish it out, but then after that, we&#x27;re replacing it with this stuff. To me, it&#x27;s totally worth the price if it keeps him happy!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive, dry skin. The doctor recommended I try Vanicream and Cetaphil and now Cetaphil is my go-to body wash.</li>
    <li> Our pediatrician recommended as our daughter (18 months) has really bothersome eczema. We use the wash anytime she takes a bath and the lotion daily. Definitely helps and NO parabens.</li>
    <li> The supplier didn&#x27;t have many reviews, so the order seemed risky, but all turned out well. Thank you for offering this product on Amazon, I live in Brazil where a bottle of Cetaphil costs about $80 and it is the ONLY product on the market over the past 25 years that actually cures my son&#x27;s serious eczema!  I buy a years supply at a time whenever I am in the US!</li>
    <li> Did nothing. Will not be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my eczema prone skin, highly recommend for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Is foamy unlike the Gentle Skin Cleanser from Cetaphil so it&#x27;s easier to use as body wash.&lt;br /&gt;Will sting if you get it into your eyes unlike the Gentle Skin Cleanser from Cetaphil so it&#x27;s not as good as a face wash.</li>
    <li> Good products, but not for kids. A burning in your eyes.</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry skin so the dermatologist suggested I try this.  It&#x27;s okay, not heavy feeling, but my skin is still dry.</li>
    <li> Works well with my eczema.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve actually found the best thing for our daughter&#x27;s eczema is to just wash her in warm water without soap, but we can&#x27;t do that every night, and this soap at least doesn&#x27;t make her eczema worse, so it&#x27;s getting a lot better. She just has super sensitive skin. We&#x27;re definitely using this soap now instead of any others. Just don&#x27;t let your kid get it in their eyes, it&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;no tears&amp;#34; type of soap for children.</li>
    <li> One of the best products out there.  My daughter has severe eczema and this body wash is a wonderful product.  It calms her skin and smooths it.</li>
    <li> I began using this product after my dermatologist recommended it because I tend to have dry, itchy patches here and there. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year now, and I can say that now I have no itchy patches. A little goes a long way with this product, so it lasts a long time. It leaves your skin feeling very clean. It has very little scent or a neutral scent. I use the auto ordering option--it&#x27;s nice to have the product arrive on the doorstep regularly. I keep a bottle in my gym bag, too.</li>
    <li> Very good product.  Does what it claims</li>
    <li> My doctor prescribed it! and i am loving it, i&#x27;ve had redness on my arms for a while but this is a magical treatment!!! my arms are clear and i am happy:)</li>
    <li> Restoraderm really works. It leaves your skin slightly moistured, so you save the job to put cream after your bath. Works on sensitive skin as well.</li>
    <li> Nice.it is very soft and smooth.compare with other bath product,it is easy to be clean up by water..</li>
    <li> I purchased Cetaphil Restoraderm Eczema Calming Body Wash for my grandmother after a very disappointing experience with Eurin Calming Body wash Oil and it&#x27;s awful smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cetaphil Restoraderm Eczema Calming Body Wash doesn&#x27;t have smell  and it really works at calming down the itching.  Another thing that impressed our family is that it is allergen free. Including  nut- free ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My grandmother is very happy with this wash and some other family members are now starting to use this product. I would highly recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> We love Cetaphil and when I saw this body soap, I got several bottles.  However it&#x27;s expensive, so while we like it . . . .&lt;br /&gt;For those with very dry skin and money.</li>
    <li> I have been using this body wash along with the lotion since my baby boy was 2 months old.  He is now 18 months old, and we still use it daily.  I tried other cleansers, but this was recommended by my pediatric dermatologist.  My baby had eczema primarily on his cheeks and legs in the early months.  This body wash is gentle and moisturizing.  It has a creamy consistency with little or no smell.  It doesn&#x27;t foam up easily, so if you want a foamy wash, this is not the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I use both the wash and the lotion, I cannot say definitively that this wash eliminated my son&#x27;s eczema alone.  I do recommend using both in tandem.  It seems that my son&#x27;s skin began to look healthier over time and today he rarely has any eczema outbreaks.  His skin is nice and smooth now.  I am so glad we found this solution for us because I did not want to use steroidal creams on a daily basis.  One note of caution.  The wash does sting if it gets in your eyes.  I tried to use it once to wash my face, and it did sting.  So, please be careful when washing those little faces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wash and the lotion are sometimes hard to find in stores, and are very expensive when you do find it.  If you use it on a regular basis and don&#x27;t have time to run around town searching for it, I recommend Amazon&#x27;s subscribe and save.  Amazon&#x27;s price is the lowest I have found.</li>
    <li> I like this body wash, but at the time of purchase it was listed one of the highest best sellers in &amp;#34;body wash&amp;#34;. It has since been correctly moved into &amp;#34;Eczema, Psoriasis &amp; Rosacea Care&amp;#34; even though the description still lists it as body wash, which may make it show up in search results for body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Isn&#x27;t it technically still body wash, and why is this an issue? Yes, technically it is, you put it on your body when you wash, but when it is listed with normal, non-medical, scented body wash (for the purpose of bathing) and is one of the highest rated, best selling items, customers such as myself purchase it with the intention of using it as body wash, not as a medical treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why is this not body wash? Because it smells terrible, like most medicine does. You need body wash, to wash yourself with after using this &amp;#34;body wash&amp;#34;. I was taking a chance on this, as my I had ran out of my favorite brand of body wash (paco rabbanne 1 million) and this was very highly rated, reviewed, and had the added benefit of being eczema calming. I was a bit perturbed when I first showered and realized I had bought a smelly bottle of medicine, not body wash. It did not lather well at all, and I had to go out and buy a different body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why 3 stars then? Because it works. Amazon (or its customers) have kind of a weird obsession with new age BS medicine. In a similar search for what would be the best item to upgrade in my home, the top results for &amp;#34;home improvement&amp;#34; included a &amp;#34;salt rock&amp;#34; of some sort.. which was basically a lamp with a fake salt rock cover that people claimed emitted odors and cured everything they could think of. Similar homeopathy and placebos can be found all over Amazon, so call me skeptical when I went back and read some more of the reviews of this product. I decided to continue to use it, despite its smell, and just rinse and use my regular body wash after it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happened? It cleared this mysterious huge mark I had in between my peck muscles that had been there for months. At first I thought it was the winter, then maybe acne, then maybe the material in some shirts had caused it, but pretty soon I realized I had no idea what it was and soaps and normal remedies would only calm it for a week or so and then it would flare up worse than ever. After about 3-4 weeks of using Cetaphil, the mark is almost completely gone, and it has stayed that way. I&#x27;ve since applied it to some eczema that showed up near my cheek and that is also staying in check. This %100 without a doubt does what it says it will do. I only wonder if I STOP using it, if the rashes will come back.It cleared this mysterious huge mark I had in between my peck muscles that had been there for months.

    <li> Have been using [[ASIN:B003UF0RB4 Cetaphil Restoraderm, Skin Restoring Body Wash, 10-ounce]] for a year or so and bought my refill from Amazon. Love the product for its capabilities. I have been using it specifically in the itchy areas of the body with great results. End of day itching and scratching gone since then.</li>
    <li> I have had itchy skin for the past few years. Doc after doc didn&#x27;t do anything about it so I decided to change up my bodywashes. Went to using Cetaphil&#x27;s moisturizers first then found this and LOVES IT!! However I am an adult so this little 10oz bottle lasts me no more than about 9 days, I attribute that to the formula and how much you have to use (Maybe it is just me and my overusing bodywash self) either way it is gone far too quickly. I can buy a Suave $3 bottle and it last 2-3 weeks. So for me that is the problem. I could not afford to buy this every weak. I went to using Free &amp; Clear as it has a 8 oz bottle at the Mayo Store for $6 bucks and a bigger 32oz bottle. If they make a bigger sized bottle I&#x27;d definitely buy it but at this price and how frequent it has to be used, I just can&#x27;t justify it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WORKS GREAT to clear up itchy skin issues and eczema.</li>
    <li> When I saw that this body wash was formulated for eczema, I was afraid that it might be so &amp;#34;mild,&amp;#34; it would just puddle up in the bath water like lotion or something.  In other words, it wouldn&#x27;t act like a regular body wash or bath soap.  But to my surprise, it&#x27;s quite the opposite -- it lathers up beautifully!  Lots and lots of frothy bubbles.  I really like that, since we DO go into the bath to get clean.  (Maybe it&#x27;s just psychological, but we associate getting clean with things that lather -- whether it be bath soap or shampoo.)  So I&#x27;m satisfied that this Cetaphil product is good in the cleaning department.  As for &amp;#34;restoration,&amp;#34; I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know how that will work out.  But I will say that my skin feels good after bathing with it ... no feeling of tightness or itchiness.  I bought it as an experiment, to see if perhaps it would be a hedge against the drying effect that bathing has on my skin.  I&#x27;m not disappointed in my purchase.  If nothing else, I have a bath product that I really enjoy using.  (And I think you will too, if you&#x27;re considering it.)  If it also &amp;#34;restores,&amp;#34; I&#x27;ll post an update to my review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had pretty good skin all my life (sans some acne outbreaks on my face). I have never had hives, rashes or problems with perfumed body washers like Aveeno, Oil of Olay, Dove, etc., however, this past summer, I somehow got crazy eczema all over my arms.  After rounds of steroids, lotions and potions I finally got rid of everything in my shower and started over with sensitive skin stuff. I&#x27;ve always used the Cetaphil moisturizers (that I buy in bulk from my local warehouse store) but decided to give this body wash a go.  JIMMINY CRICKETS did this make a huge difference. My skin calmed down within a couple of days and I am now convinced that the body wash I was using beforehand somehow irritated my skin.  Now I&#x27;m on anti-histamines and a steroid cream, but the skin on the rest of my body feels great too.  I&#x27;m definitely repurchasing this over and over.</li>
    <li> This is the only body wash I use now.  Although it isn&#x27;t scented it provides a good, gentle clean.  Great for hands, face, and body.</li>
    <li> This is the only type of body wash my little girl can use. She has eczema that flares up really badly with any other body wash I&#x27;ve ever tried and this paired with the accompanying body lotion treats her skin great.</li>
    <li> Excellent for my toddler&#x27;s excema.  Nothing else has worked on her skin other than this product.  I use with the Restoraderm lotion.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine who works for a dermatologist recommended this lotion and body wash. My 2 year old has eczema and we have tried tons of things in the last two years to help with the appearance. Of all the prescriptions and over the counter creams, lotions, detergents, body washes-nothing has helped-UNTIL NOW. Cetaphil is AMAZING. I could not be more thrilled with the results. His arms are almost totally clear!!! His legs (the worst area) have improved dramatically, and we haven&#x27;t been using it long at all (so I&#x27;m sure we will continue to see results.) I was really beginning to think there was nothing out there. If you are skeptical, as I was, please give this a try!</li>
    <li> No real issues with this product but not overly special for my daughters eczema</li>
    <li> We use this at bath time and aveeno eczema cream before bed with great results on our 2yr old!</li>
    <li> I bought this per recommendation by the pediatrician for my baby&#x27;s eczema.  He immediately looks better after bathing and washing with this body wash.  When I heard that my dad had some itchy skin problems, I also bought him one.  My dad is not someone who likes body washes.  He usually likes the harsh soaps, but after using this, he said his skin is less itchy and he wanted more of it!  So I&#x27;m really impressed with this wash.</li>
    <li> This totally cleared up my preschoolers eczema! We use it in combo with the Cetephil cream (in the tub - NOT the lotion in the bottle) and it&#x27;s magic for him.</li>
    <li> Great product and gentle for sensitive skin.  My munchkin has eczema and this is great for his skin.  I started using aquaphor over the damp skin after bath and I can see a huge difference in his skin.</li>
    <li> My daughter has very bad eczema! Tried it twice and both times she cried so hard! She cried desperately! :( not buying ever again!</li>
    <li> Good for sensitive skin!!</li>
    <li> I definitely didn&#x27;t notice this product helping with itching, but it did clear up some of the ingrown hairs I had around my groin area.</li>
    <li> I wish I had found this wash sooner. It is the absolute best! I used to get little red bumps on my arms when I used any type of body wash or soap, not so with this body wash. It has also calmed some of the redness in my skin. I cannot recommend this enough!</li>
    <li> Definitely a good body wash for sensitive skin, but did nothing dramatic to help alleviate any eczema issues. I thought the formula was a little watery as well. I would have preferred a creamier lotion-type product. Also, the price was comparable to any other pharmacy pricing.</li>
    <li> I buy two one came all spilled</li>
    <li> wanted the moisturizing but not availble anymore,  this is still good.</li>
    <li> This is a great soap for kids with eczema. It&#x27;s very mild and doesn&#x27;t leave residue. The only thing I wish they can improve on is to make it &amp;#34;tear-less.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> As my husband declines from ALS, his skin has become more sensitive. I&#x27;ve been using this daily for two years. The price is outrageously opportunistic, but it works better than Aveeno and other Cetaphil washes. If you have to wait to order it here, and need it now, the price is within a buck of this price at Target. Choose carefully: The label for the moisturizing lotion is very similar- and an expensive mistake. I buy them in 3-packs here.</li>
    <li> Hands feel so much better.  Need very little to clean hands.  Use it at home and work.  Change my life.</li>
    <li> u need to use the cream to get a better faster results this is a very good product along with the others.</li>
    <li> First time purchase this from Amazon, and disappointed. When I received this body wash, it&#x27;s not wrapped up and the bottle is very dusty (seems like it had been placed on the shelves for some time - ?) And there&#x27;s a very strong chemical smell, is it supposed to smell like that?&lt;br /&gt;I bought 3 bottles after reading the reviews, a bit regret now.</li>
    <li> I had to use this body wash in conjunction with the lotion after another brand and product caused red blotches and dry patches on my pregnant belly.  This calm my skin condition by reducing the itchiness.</li>
    <li> I use this product every night for several months and I definitely see that my skin looks more soft and supple and clean. I saw on Dr. Oz the powerful anti aging properties of phytoceramides, CoQ10 and Reservatrol, and I tried both Renuvaderm and PhytoDerm [[ASIN:B00JK5ZN76 Renuvaderm - The Most Complete Anti-Aging Skin Supplement!]] and [[ASIN:B00IT4POOG PhytoDerm - The Best 100% Pure Skin Restoring Anti-Aging Phytoceramides!]] and found that each of these were like a facelift in a bottle, with the Renuvaderm working better for me. Combine this mask with Renuvaderm for amazing results</li>
    <li> It seems to do the trick with my eczema.</li>
    <li> Just what the doctor ordered for my eczema!  My skin is already nearly completely cleared up after only a week!</li>
    <li> My 14 mo was born with sensitive skin, tried various products to ease her discomfort right from first was, J&amp;J and California baby made matters worse. I am so glad i tried this and till date she has a soft subtle skin. No tears and no harsh chemicals. I am glad this worked for me</li>
    <li> Been buying these for a few years now and it still works brilliantly. It leaves your skin feeling really soft and smooth and reduces the redness of bumps and acne. It won&#x27;t completely eliminate acne, but it will make it look less unsightly</li>
    <li> I have shopped and shopped and shopped around for a good eczema product for my toddler and preschooler and this is not it. It certainly doesn&#x27;t make their eczema worse by any means, but it doesn&#x27;t help it either. I&#x27;m much more impressed with Aveeno&#x27;s Baby Eczema body wash which seems about 20 times thicker and more moisturizing than this stuff. My husband likes this product though, so I keep it around for him.</li>
    <li> Love it for my kids and myself. We used to have tiny bumps all over our skin, and now we don&#x27;t. I can really tell a difference when I go to a hotel and use another soap product. I even noticed it made my hands peel less and started putting it in our sink soap dispensers.</li>
    <li> I have weird skin, much like most of the reviewers here. If I abruptly change my diet, shampoo, or soap my skin reacts differently. If I am in a different location, my skin reacts differently. If I go a whole day without showering my skin and hair are drenched in oil and it doesn&#x27;t feel nice. With Cetaphil, my skin looks and feels better, pimples created by the previous oil are gone, and my hands feel soft and not oily. I can go the whole weekend without showering, if I am feeling lazy and still feel pretty fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before Cetaphil, if I touched my smartphone or a touchscreen computer, it would leave oil marks. Actually if I touched just about any glossy surface an oil mark would have been left. Now there is no oil on my fingers!!! For my whole life I have also had very dry feet. Tn the summer could have been substituted for shoes (think Hobbits). While that came in handy sometimes, my feet never looked good. As a surprise bonus, Cetaphil keeps my feet soft and after two weeks use the calluses and corns are already starting to heal and starting to disappear!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another bonus that I have discovered is what it does to my nails. The skin between my nails and fingers would always get dried out and crack. Making it hurt when my nails grew out too long. Also causing hangnails. In two weeks of use in very windy weather, near the Boston Shoreline. No hangnails and dryness!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cetaphil keeps on surprising me with how much it helps my skin. Don&#x27;t believe the quacks. This stuff works!</li>
    <li> My skin guy says use this or go to Rx for dry, cracked skin.  Love it!</li>
    <li> My 2 y/o has had eczema most of his life.  This body wash really helps.  I only give him a bath a couple times a week because the water dries out his skin and I only use the Cetaphil Restoraderm body wash.  When I run out and go to the generic, I have noticed the eczema coming back again.  The only downside is that it isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;tear-free&amp;#34; and it bothers his eyes if I wash his hair with it and the water runs in his eyes. So I use this as just a body wash, wash his hair with another product, and then immediately take him out of the bath.</li>
    <li> Did not notice any difference in my eczema, bottle is only 10 ounces so is way more expensive per ounce than all other body washes also.</li>
    <li> Our daughter had lots of skin problems starting around six months.  Slathering her daily in Aquaphor and using enormous amounts of hydrocortisone was barely doing the job.  We started using this product on a doctor&#x27;s recommendation and since then her skin has been clear, we rarely use hydrocortisone and only apply a bit of Aquaphor in what were formerly the worst patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously there is the correlation/causation ambiguity here, but anecdotally for us this wash appears to have greatly improved her skin condition and allowed us to dial down the use of heavier treatments.  Or perhaps things happened to get better on their own about the same time as we started using this.  We likely will never know.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this wash. My son has battled eczema his entire life, and this wash is his favorite.  He has always not enjoyed showering, I think in particular because it seems like he was just always scrubbing and never seeing any results.  With this wash, he says it feels a great, and he has come up several times and said (with pride) &amp;#34;Dad! Look at my legs!&amp;#34;  It&#x27;s just about the best feeling a dad can get!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We follow this up with Aveno Eczema lotion, which also seems to help a great deal.</li>
    <li> I have rosacea, and I have been very happy with my skin since I started using this product.  I have trouble finding it in the grocery stores, so I am thrilled I can get it from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Its clear up my aczema I recommend it strongly no any prescription stuff works with me this one does million thumbs up</li>
    <li> Again, I finally found a dermatologist that explained all the skin problems were to all the products in skin care products that are just plain irritating.  This at least makes me feel clean.  so many sensitive skin care products do not feel like you had a good cleaning after using.</li>
    <li> If you have eczema, dermatitis or any other skin condition that requires a very mild cleanser - this is it! Due to allergies had an episode of atopic dermatitis and could not wash with any of my soaps. Ordered this and it worked like a charm. Got my skin back to normal fast.</li>
    <li> This body wash is amazing.  This winter I felt like a reptile, my skin was so dry.  I don&#x27;t have eczema, but I do have really dry skin in the winter and this really helped.</li>
    <li> my bodywash luv it i took a shower my skin feel soft and not drie out like others i use its a whole different feel iam going to stick with this people said its to high u get what u pay for i will buy again this stuff works for me</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin with occasional outbreaks of eczema. My dermatologist suggested Restoraderm.  I use it daily with good results.  I still harbor a suspicion that a moisturizing soap like Dove might be as effective and much less expensive.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Didn&#x27;t leave my skin dry at all.</li>
    <li> I suffer from Psoriasis and I was looking out for a possible cream or wash solution that could ease the itching and the scaling. I ordered this body wash after reading few of the positive reviews and I was in for a treat. To my pleasant surprise it started working since day 1. I could feel the difference on my skin after using it for just a week now. I am not saying it will cure anything but this is as good as it gets for a body wash. I would highly recommend for people suffering from similar skin condition to give it a try. It’s worth a try.</li>
    <li> We have tried a lot of products since my son developed Eczema at around 6 months of age. This product, along with the lotion, are staples now in his skin care routine. I used them under his dermatologist&#x27;s recommendation first around 10 or 11 months old and have used daily since (he just turned 4).</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have eczema but I do have irritated and dry skin.  This soap works better than anything else that I have tried to relieve the irritation.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this stuff, based on all the good reviews.  While I&#x27;ve dealt with eczema primarily on my arms for most of my life, the past few months I have seen the most severe flare up I&#x27;ve had in a while, and I&#x27;ve been spending quite a bit of money on different products that have yet to give me any lasting relief.  I paired this with the Restoraderm Skin Restoring Moisturizer, and for a few days, I really thought it was going to see some improvements.  I had developed some slight eczema on my neck and back for the first time, which seemed to react well to both products, and at this point have disappeared.  However, the more severe patches I have on my arms, that flare up the most in cold weather, burned/itched and turned bright red as soon as I used these products.  I gave it some time to perhaps let my skin acclimate to the new products, but to no avail.  I won&#x27;t say this stuff doesn&#x27;t work completely, but sadly the slight relief I had on some areas of my skin was overshadowed by the poor reaction I had on other areas.  Perhaps it will be better suited to maintaining my clearer skin once I find a way to get rid of my more severe flare ups.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had eczema-prone skin for most of my life.  I get tiny bumps and itching on my arms, legs and torso.  My eczema seems to be worst if I&#x27;ve been sweating for a long period of time and I haven&#x27;t had a chance to shower right away (example: if I go for a long bicycle ride).  This body wash really seems to sooth and quiet my skin.  You can really tell that it&#x27;s very gentle, and made for eczema in mind.  It hasn&#x27;t eliminated my eczema completely, and occasionally I still have to apply prescription-strength steroid cream to spot treat itchy areas.  The smell takes some getting used to (I think it&#x27;s the shae butter?), but it&#x27;s barely noticeable after you wash it off and not at all offensive.  It&#x27;s all I use ever since switching to this product.</li>
    <li> Perfect body wash however I mainly use it for my face. This wash says it is formulated for eczema, which I actually don&#x27;t have, but I have an allergy to fragrance and I also have rosacea (a skin condition causing redness and burning sensation on the face). This soap/wash is really perfect for sensitive skin and even extremely sensitive skin like mine. For many years I used another wash for my face that I could only get in Europe but now that I have found this it actually seems to work better and it is less expensive than the other.</li>
    <li> So happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> Smells. Don&#x27;t like it. Did not notice any improvement in my skin, runny, and stinks!</li>
    <li> I have super sensitive skin and this stuff is awesome - no issues whatsoever</li>
    <li> I used to use ivory soap and super-hot water in the shower, then I moved on to Dove for sensitive skin.  I started breaking out in itchy rashes on my neck everyday.  My skin has become dry and delicate.  I now use nothing but Cetaphil Restoraderm in the shower and the itchy rashes have stopped.  My skin feels clean and soft.</li>
    <li> Smells very clinical.</li>
    <li> My son had severe eczema. This wash seems gentle on him. I use this together with the cream.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year and its very good in helping with dry skin.  I use it in conjunction with another prescribed salve I apply after showering.</li>
    <li> Perfect for children with sensitive skin. Both my kids use this product.</li>
    <li> I like what this does for my skin, but the product I purchased through Amazon had somewhat of an odd odor to it, and it was very runny.  I would still recommend this product to anyone who has a skin condition or just wants soft skin.  It does work very well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from horrible eczema my whole life and nothing was working for me. I was hesitant to try this due to the price - and since there&#x27;s only 10 oz per bottle! Best decision ever. This, paired with the Restoraderm lotion, makes for an unbeatable combo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this consistently for the past 4 months and my eczema is pretty much gone.</li>
    <li> This soap seems as gentle as washing with oatmeal. I am really impressed and prefer this soap over Aveeno products for sensitive skin areas/conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update; 03/04/2015: Although I had been using this soap exclusivelty in my shower, I now have it at every sink in my house. My hands had recently developed inflammation and a rough, thick, wrinkly texture. They end up looking way older than they should for my age, by about 1-2 decades. Sad moment in a girl&#x27;s life. Anyhoo, I am now only using this soap on my hands, wherever I am, which is important because I wash my hands a lot. I think my OCD turned up a notch for some reason. And everytime I was using regular soap on my hands, the skin just hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My solution:&lt;br /&gt;1.) As written above, I have switched over tio this soap every where in my house.&lt;br /&gt;2.) I dry brushed my hands, almost as if sanding them down until the sklin appeared smoother about three nights ago.&lt;br /&gt;3.) The only lotion I am using now is my own batch of homemade cocoa butter/shea butter/coconut oil blend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the results: I am only a few days into this and my hand &amp;#34;wrinkles&amp;#34; are getting smaller and some of my younger skin is starting to show through again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update again at a later date.</li>
    <li> I brought this for my daughter and she loves it  and the price was right, so I brought them multiple ones.</li>
    <li> My skin is arid and it can get irritated easily.  The body wash dries it out less than anything else I have tried (still dries my skin, but not as much as other products.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a coincidence or not, but since we started using this body wash, my 6 year old&#x27;s eczema has gotten so much better. We used to use Johnson &amp; Johnson products. This is expensive but seems worth it because she&#x27;s not scratching her back all the time anymore!!</li>
    <li> Love this for my Eczema, it really helps!!</li>
    <li> This product is very nice to use. And it treats dry skin, scaly skin. My dermotologist recommended it and it works well. The supplier shipped on time and packed the box well. No leakage.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell as good as you would like, to use as a body wash. Didn&#x27;t see any change on my skin after uses.</li>
    <li> It feels good after using it, but the problem is that there wasnt any wrappings protect the botle.  The liquid can come out easily</li>
    <li> Smells a little weird, but does a great job on chronically dry skin.  Don&#x27;t get this stuff in your eyes, it burns like hell.</li>
    <li> This body wash is effective with restoring the skin.  I do have eczema and dry skin and it does reduce the eczema, skin gets a little softer.  The bottle size is not very big, 10 oz, so in no time, I need to purchase more at a higher price compared to many other body wash.  My Dermatologist recommended that I use this body wash, it has no floral, herbal smell or other scent.</li>
    <li> My poor daughter had been struggling with eczema for over a year and we tried all kinds of products..nothing helped. It was discouraging to say the least, especially when it got so bad she was itching so much it was causing patches that were red and bloody in spots.  This product has turned her skin around! It&#x27;s not 100% yet, but after a few weeks of using this along with the restoraderm lotion twice dailys it&#x27;s about 90% cleared up. I would definitely recommend this to anyone with eczema or dry skin.</li>
    <li> My 4-year-old daughter has eczema--the only thing that worked so far to control that is some super-expensive ayurvedic soap. We decided to give this one a try and it worked! The eczema is under control for the one month for which she is using this. Love this.</li>
    <li> Great value for a hard to find product.</li>
    <li> This body wash makes my aging skin feel wonderful.  I don&#x27;t have Eczema, but I do suffer from very sensitive skin.  This body wash definitely soothed my skin and did not cause any skin problems.  I was even able to use it on my face (I do suffer from Rosacea).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had anything better. I use it daily and feel I get a good clean from it.</li>
    <li> Dermatologist recommended to use daily with the matching lotion to get rid of severe eczema on my 2 year old... cleared it up in less than a week!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> When the skin gets very dry its hard to wash with soaps even soaps that state they will not dry the skin.  Dr recommended this item and Iove it, leaves the skin soft and not dry.  Highly recommend priced within market -</li>
    <li> washes very well for 13 month old daughters eczema. very gentle and feels thick and moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Genuine seller and product. I feel a lot better now. I also recommend similar products for laundry detergent, antihistamine cream for skin</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. I will continue to use it as it leaves my skins soft and moisturized.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to my 82 year old mom by her dermatologist. She has severe dry skin. She had previously used all other products but nothing worked like this body wash. Her skin has improved drastically. No more dry itchy skin. Now its smooth and the itch has disappeared. Great product!</li>
    <li> My son has bad eczema. When it started a few years ago his dermatologist recommended this product. I bought it figuring it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try. It works great. It is one of the only soaps and body washes that do not cause his eczema to flare up. We also use the lotion they make for eczema. This combination has mostly kept his eczema at bay so we have rarely needed to use his prescription creams.</li>
    <li> Work as well as much more expensive body wash my dermatologist advised me to use. Rinses off  without leaving a residue on my skin</li>
    <li> The dermatologist recommended this for my Grandson who has been challenged with dry, itchy, irratating eczema for several years.  As soon as he starts to sweat while playing the scratching begins.  In the winter it is almost worse when he uses hotter water for bathing.  He has been using this body wash for a couple of months now and WoW - what a difference in his outbreaks - Much fewer and farther between.  Loving the relief he is getting!  Thank you Cetaphil :-)</li>
    <li> This Worked like a charm, skin improved bigtime. This took care of the eczema trifecta itchiness, dryness and unsightly splotches.</li>
    <li> daily use for dry irritated skin</li>
    <li> I use this to bath my kid which suffers from light eczema. It has helped him a lot. His skin is smoother and not as itchy as before. I&#x27;ll keep purchasing it.</li>
    <li> Have very dry skin and hoped this would help with the dry skin. It is nice in its feel but did nothing to help. Even used it along with lotion.</li>
    <li> It really has helped with my sensitive skin. The product lathers up nicely &amp; it goes a long way. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Have  been using for several years since being diagnosed  with Lupus DLE.  It&#x27;&#x27;s a very good product and really helps my skin.</li>
    <li> Works great for my sons dry skin.</li>
    <li> Great Stuff.  A bit pricey, but my dermatologist recommended for heat rash, and seems to help.</li>
    <li> Safe for my sensitive skin</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this because I have sensitive skin that is prone to eczema.  It has worked wonders for me.  I use it everyday. It&#x27;s very gentle and keeps skin from drying out.</li>
    <li> Skin hurts crumbled soften it out with cetaphill</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to try yet another &#x27;eczema&#x27; product.... but this one is good.  You feel a tingle on your skin when you use it.  I have noticed an improvement in my skin.  On my third bottle and plan to continue using.</li>
    <li> I actually intended to buy the moisturizer, but picked the wrong item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mistake...it happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it is winter, the air is dry and my skin can use every bit of help it can get.&lt;br /&gt;So, it turns out this body wash helps my skin a lot. It is much less dry and flaky (yes, I am flaky, ask my wife).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So...recommended!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have have eczema or any really apparent skin disorder, but my skins does tend to be sensitive to many soaps.  I find this wash to be mild enough but very cleansing too.  I like this as much as any I have tried.  I will continue to use this.</li>
    <li> My gal who has eczema didn&#x27;t like it...says it&#x27;s stingy to her (she has a bit of broken skins due to scratching).</li>
    <li> They are good stuff because I always use Cetaphil products, e.g. moristurizer, body wash and cleanser.  Samples were given by my determologist.  Do you have the pump style?</li>
    <li> It was just what I was looking for without the hassle of going to store to get. Very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. I use it on my two year old who has eczema, per the recommendation of her derm. Within a week of starting it her patches started to clear. We also use the lotion. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Liquid is thin so be careful when you pour. A little expensive for my taste. Son still has eczema btw.</li>
    <li> I buy these for my mother who has very sensitive and dry skin. It&#x27;s probably the only thing that works for her. I buy the moisturizer to pair with it. Been buying this for my mom for three years now.</li>
    <li> Your skin feels so soft. Nice product. So far I like it. Haven&#x27;t been using it that long.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this item for myself, after being diagnosed with keratosis pilaris by my dermatologist.  It wasn&#x27;t so bad that I needed to get it treated, after all, I&#x27;ve been living with it for all my life.  However after asking my dermatologist about it, she recommended that I try this body wash in conjunction with a Cerave [[ASIN:B0071XPQQ2 Cerave Sa Renewing Skin Lotion, 8 Ounce]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using both, over months, my skin cleared up and became less bumpy.  However, using both items daily just for a mild condition that I didn&#x27;t think was serious became somewhat expensive.  So I stopped using them both and the leftover bottle of Cetaphil body wash just sat there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is until my infant daughter&#x27;s skin started to become really dry.  The worst area of dryness was her face and her cheeks started to have a \\&quot;cracking\\&quot; look with redness.  We&#x27;ve tried Aquaphor, J&amp;J baby lotion, and even coconut oil on her cheeks, but nothing helped.  The only thing my wife and I could think of was that perhaps the [[ASIN:B00MNSEOSG Johnson&#x27;s Baby Head-to-Toe Wash, 28 Ounce]] we&#x27;ve been using when giving our daughter a bath was the reason her skin was drying out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then she said she was going to try the Cetaphil Restoraderm.  She read on the back of the bottle that it was safe for babies 3 months and older and it was awarded the seal of acceptance by the National Eczema Association.  After using it for about a week, my daughter&#x27;s cheeks are no longer red and they are now smooth!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess we never realized that she had eczema, which our pediatrician said was common with babies, since they have delicate/sensitive skin.  Thanks to Cetaphil Restoraderm, this review is proof that it works great for both adults &amp; babies alike.</li>
    <li> The description says that it is great for eczema and it is!  I have seen a change for the better in my kids skin for sure.</li>
    <li> Especially wonderful for those whose skin is sensitive to the chemicals in body washes such as Dove. This creates has virtually no scent, abundant suds, cleans effectively, and leaves skin soft. What more can one ask?</li>
    <li> My 3 yr old has extremely dry skin and moderate eczema and my husband has severe eczema. I had been using Aveeno Baby Wash on my son since birth but his skin has always been so dry and irritated looking. I tried this after reading other reviews and for my son it was like magic. The next day his skin was signficantly better! He still has dry skin from time to time, but the really bad patches were far better and it&#x27;s not dry every day like it was before. I have since convinced my husband to try it too. His skin is much worse, but it does seem to be helping some.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! It&#x27;s done wonders on my daughter&#x27;s skin! I wanted to try thus one last product before giving up on body washes that help her skin be more smooth as nothing seemed to work.  This did work!</li>
    <li> delivery in excellent conditions packaging and on time, perfect product (new) as described. Thank you!</li>
    <li> The good stuff makes a good difference.  I&#x27;ve tried Walmart&#x27;s version of this product and it just isn&#x27;t the same.  I&#x27;ve got some minor eczema and using this in conjunction with the related lotion helps to keep it in check during the dry winter months.  Pay attention to the directions that say to pat dry with a towel after coming out of the shower rather than rubbing your body.  You&#x27;re just wiping away some of the protection.</li>
    <li> Best bodywash for making skin smooth and calm. If you have skin burns/bug bites this is damn good.    I rated it four star because of the price. However good it is, it cannot be so costly for a small bottle.    To optimise the usage, apply it just on face and you may use other body wash/bar for the body.</li>
    <li> Works wonders on my daughters skin. She has exzema and nothing else works for her. I love it</li>
    <li> Good For the winter skin</li>
    <li> I have been a long time sufferer of Atopic Dermatitis/Eczema for years now. I am 34 years old now but have had it since I was about 3-4 years old. I&#x27;ve been to many dermatologists throughout the city and they tell me the exact same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After doing research on the National Eczema Association website, I found Cetaphil&#x27;s Lubriderm. I&#x27;ve always liked Cetaphil&#x27;s cream and decided to give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say this is probably the one body wash that has helped really restore the moisture in my skin and helped my eczema!  Use this along with the Cetaphil Restoraderm Lotion and you&#x27;ll notice a significant different. It really does help in the itching and dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist, and just love it!! Never leaves your skin feeling dry. Never use anything else on my skin as a body wash, however I use another product on my face.</li>
    <li> This is reasonably priced at Amazon as I have compared in my local stores.&lt;br /&gt;It is a good product.</li>
    <li> Still good but did not work as expected</li>
    <li> Moisturizes well. My skin feels smoother than before.</li>
    <li> great product for sensitive skin</li>
    <li> Meu filho tem alergia a proteínas do leite de vaca (APLV). Esse sabonete líquido é excelente. Recomendo!!!</li>
    <li> This body wash works like a charm! Thank you so very much!</li>
    <li> There are way too many ingredients in this and it did not stop the allergy problems.</li>
    <li> My son has struggled with chronic eczema his entire life. He started using Cetaphil Restoraderm a few months ago and his skin is remarkably improved. Even though it is summer, he is almost completely rash free and he informed me today that he hadn&#x27;t scratched for a while and he isn&#x27;t itchy. This is a boy who used to always be itchy. His allergy doctor has also commented on how good his skin looks.  I&#x27;m so grateful for this product!</li>
    <li> i live in area with single digit humidity for the most part, this product helps my skin and prevents dry skin \\&quot;itch&#x27;</li>
    <li> My skin had been severely damaged due to using a steriod for way too long. Cetaphil was recommended by a friend. I chose the Restoraderm product and am amazed at how quickly the skin has been repaired.</li>
    <li> This body wash, I found to be gentle and non irritating for atopic skin. Has made a real difference in the smoothness of my very dry skin.</li>
    <li> I have tried every moisturizing body wash . I will not go without the Restoraderm.  It is amazing for my extremely dry skin. Love it! Thank you Cetaphil!</li>
    <li> I read the reviews on babies screaming their hearts out after getting the soap in their eyes. I tried it nonetheless. It was fine. It&#x27;s non-drying and gentle. You do have to be careful to not rub it into baby&#x27;s eyes but that would be the standard for any soap use.</li>
    <li> This works so great on my psoriasis.  I was so happy to realize that Cetaphil was making body wash!  This product works great for calming my psoriasis especially during the drier, winter months.  I highly recommend to anyone suffering with skin issues.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for people with sensitive skin, or people that are probe to get folliculitis (which is why i bought it).  It&#x27;s expensive but you don&#x27;t need to use a lot.</li>
    <li> I have eczema and this stuff works great! I had my doubts and stopped using it for a while, but it definitely proved to be a mistake and went back to it. I learned my lesson and will never do it again!</li>
    <li> I think this product is average it works okay I thought it would work better I have ezema on my back it only helped somewhat I do not think I will buy this product again I also bought the soap as well but I have not used it as of yet maybe the soap will work better!</li>
    <li> Very good to take care my son&#x27;s Eczema.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I had some horrible itch rash and couldn&#x27;t figure out what it was. The doctors had no idea either. I decided to use this wash and it was relieving immediately. I have decided to always use it and love it! I can add different essential oils to it as well to scent it!</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t really help us! tried VaniCream instead and that stuff is awesome! my daughter is black and has eczema, and we have tried soo many products..Leave everything and go try Vanicream, ok, just do it! I am sure this may work for some, but it din&#x27;t for us..</li>
    <li> My 2 year old had molluscum bumps EVERYWHERE. This cetaphil product is amazing. We use the wash and the moisturizer. We noticed a difference overnight...and by day 5 even his &amp;#34;weeping&amp;#34; mollluscum bumps were pretty much unnoticeable. Best investment for kids with skin issues!</li>
    <li> This is a great body wash. My dermatologist recommended it a couple of years ago and I haven stopped using it since. I get it auto shipped from Amazon every 8 weeks or so. Highly recommend for dry or troubled skin.</li>
    <li> very good, just as expected!</li>
    <li> Gets the itching to STOP.  I have very dry skin and when I use it my skin is calmer. Cetaphil makes great products for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Great product for sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> Best wash out there for my baby with Exzema. I tried everything and this one was the trick. A little goes a long way. His skin is back to beautiful.</li>
    <li> Oh Cetaphil, I am about to get emotional describing the effects your body wash had on me! I am 22 years old and have been struggling with the most sensitive, itchy, oily, blemished, clogged skin on the planet, and now I am healthy, clear, radiant, and happy as ever because of this body wash. I use it as a facial cleanser AND as a body wash in the shower, and I have no zits, little oil, and happy skin. I have received so many compliments on my skin because of this cleanser, which literally never happened considering I have struggled with acne since BIRTH (it seems like), and I have actually had to practice accepting such compliments. I have tried everything from other Cetaphil face washes to Pro-Active to Clean and Clear to Dove soap to dermatological nightmares to obtain the skin I have now. I randomly tried this wash from a friend&#x27;s house not knowing it was for the baby (whoops hahaha) and I noticed a difference in my skin in one use. I had red splotches on my skin from its civil war, and they disappeared almost immediately. I went out and got a bottle of this that night. I have THE MOST extremely sensitive skin, and I cannot use ANYTHING it seems like, or else my skin declares war. Even if you just use it as body wash, it moisturizes  your skin very well, and will not leave that white funny residue that other soaps do. The only con I have is that it makes my nostrils feel funny if it gets up inside of them during cleansing, and I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s not supposed to be used as a face wash. OH WELL. I use it because it&#x27;s a literal cure-all, and I will never use anything else! :)</li>
    <li> Cetaphil Restoraderm, Skin Restoring Body Wash along with there lotion is a great combo for dry skin, very good product</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a few years now and I have not found anything elses that compares.  It is worth the money.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time on recommendation from my Dermatologist.  It really helps my skin and helps to keep itching down.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my daughter&#x27;s pediatrician for her atopic dermatitis. It works fairly well and I will continue to use it</li>
    <li> This is a good body wash for people who get itchy, bumpy skin.  I do water aerobics three times/week, and my dermatologist recommended Cetaphil body wash for my showers instead of regular soap.  It&#x27;s helped me a lot with with my dry, itchy &#x27;swimer&#x27;s skin&#x27;.</li>
    <li> This worked amazingly! My 5 month old had an eczema outbreak after the holidays and this took care of it in less than 3 days. Now I use this twice a day and his skin has never looked better.</li>
    <li> My 10 month old has very dry skin thanks to my bad genes.  Its was getting progressively more dry and rough since about 5 months old, until we found this body wash.  Had used aveeno, burts bees, without results.  Will be using this as long as I&#x27;m bathing him myself :)</li>
    <li> I like this lotion, not greasy, blends into my skin with minimal effort.  I really like this product.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and have issues with many skin products. I seem to be allergic to alot around me as plastics, plants etc. I get red rashs from almost anything.  The dermatologist recommended Cetaphil to wash my face. He told me he wasnt \\&quot;selling me anything\\&quot; he just recommended it for his patients. I am a busy nurse and I come in contact with all sorts of things so I keep a bottle at work when things \\&quot;bother\\&quot; my skin. I use the whole line of Cetaphil brand. The body wash calms my troubled skin. It isnt too soapy and has no dyes. It rinses very easy.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin. when I use this Cetaphil body wash, id do not itch. I alternate with some of the commercial body washes.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best product for elderly people with paper thin skin, I use it on my Mom and it is so gentle and easily rinsed off.  One bottle usually lasts 1 month with daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terrific item</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, rosacea, and non-specific derm issues on my face.  This is the first wash of any kind that does not leave my skin feeling tight-yet-oily, or exacerbate the redness of my skin. I use it with my Clairsonic, then I pair it with Cetaphil Restoraderm Skin Restoring Moisturizer and my bare face hasn&#x27;t looked this good in 10 years!</li>
    <li> feels good and smooth and does not irritate skin.  I recommend it which is a big deal since it has my stamp of approval.</li>
    <li> Since I use it for my daughter, she never complain about itchy after bath.  It works, she is happy, I am happy too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a pretty good experience with this product.  My dermatologist recommended it, and the only hesitation that I have is that I&#x27;m not familiar with a lot of the ingredients.</li>
    <li> I got this for my girlfriend because she has a skin condition and of course it worked great.  The product cleared here skin up so she felt comfortable enough to wear a bikini on our vacation to Hawaii.</li>
    <li> The only product I have found that actually helps my son&#x27;s eczema!</li>
    <li> I have been using this body wash for 6 months now for itchy, scaly, dry skin due to eczema.  I have noticed a definite improvement in the affected areas.  If I stop using it even for a few days, I do notice a relapse.  My only reservation about this product is that it stings my eyes.  So, now I avoid using it near my face when I use it.  I coordinate it with Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream after washing.  So far, this product has really helped me!</li>
    <li> This was good for my itchy dry skin. Didn&#x27;t soothe right away but after a week or so my skin cleared up. In combo with Vaseline.</li>
    <li> good product, very fulfilled in delivery</li>
    <li> I must be highly sensitive to one or more of the chemicals used in these Restoraderm products, because I didn&#x27;t see any other reviewers mention the type of issues I experienced with the body wash, although there are a few negative reviews about the lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During a recent outbreak I decided to try Restoraderm Body Wash, and when I applied it to my face and torso I noticed a bit of tingling, not quite stinging, it was just strange. I&#x27;ve previously used body washes by Aveeno, Alba, Nature&#x27;s gate and Yes To Carrots, with no ill effects. After drying off I applied Restoraderm Skin Moisturizer (which I&#x27;d also never used before) to my hands and inside of left elbow. After about 7 minutes my hands began to get irritated and burn, and then my inner left elbow began to itch and burn. They continued to worsen, and after 15 minutes I washed off every area where I&#x27;d applied the lotion. There was almost immediate relief and the stinging dissipated. I applied one of my other lotions and there was no such stinging. The next day I repeated the process with the Restoraderm body wash and lotion, and had the same problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturer&#x27;s phone number isn&#x27;t listed anywhere on the bottles, nor on cetaphil.com, so I had to search for a phone number. I called Galderma (the mfgr) and they put me in touch with a nurse who took a report of my experience; She gave no indication as to what may have caused the stinging. Since then I&#x27;ve only used  Aveeno Skin Relief and Organix Moroccan Argan Oil Creamy Oil body washes, and have used Aveeno, Yes To Carrots, Neutrogena and Eucerin lotions, and have had no adverse effects whatsoever. I received a packet of papers from Galdeena in which they wanted me to give them more information, including a list of the medications I take, but I&#x27;m not giving them my personal or medical information so I threw them away. They also sent a check to reimburse me for the body wash and the lotion.</li>
    <li> Freaking amazing body wash. Makes my skin crazy soft.</li>
    <li> It helps a lot for my sons eczema! Thanks for having this kind of product Amazon!</li>
    <li> our doctor recommended this as a soap/shampoo option for our baby and it&#x27;s working great- he smells and feels clean, and there&#x27;s no rashes.  cured up the cradle cap too!</li>
    <li> Very gentle on the skin.  Does not dry it out like other body washes.  Recommended by my doctor.</li>
    <li> Much better than soap for my dry, itchy skin, but it makes a slippery mess in the shower</li>
    <li> Have eczema that acts up when my skin is dry. Have not had an outbreak since I started using this. Love it!!</li>
    <li> Our 2 yr old daughter has eczema and this really does help out with it. We have tried to stop using it and her eczema would come back more. Great product!!</li>
    <li> Went thru a bottle of this before realizing it had alcohol and parabens in it. I try to avoid those things. It was gentle on my skin, but at what cost? I&#x27;d rather find something without parabens and alcohol. Why do so many of these products contain alcohol anyway? How is that good for your skin? It&#x27;s not.</li>
    <li> Saw results within a week; doctor pleased!</li>
    <li> i only use this in the winters in chicago. the wind and cold make your skin super dry, this helps stave off eczema and keep it at bay as long as possible. it is a really small bottle though, i thought it would be bigger. it also is more fragrant than i expected and rather thick. it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;foam&amp;#34; very well unless you use a poof.</li>
    <li> Works well. It does not seem to make any difference with the reddness. Smell good. Price could be a bit lower.</li>
    <li> There is definitely Methylisothiazolinone in this product (listed on bottle I received March 2015). Amazon for some reason doesn&#x27;t list this... so be aware of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the way the product soaps and feels on my skin but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s made a difference; if anything, my skin feels drier the next day and almost a little itchy. Maybe it&#x27;s the Methylisothiazolinone. Might be returning this soon.</li>
    <li> What the doctor recommended</li>
    <li> I recently got eczema on my eyelids out of no where. I have never had skin issues such as drying, as my skin is actually pretty oily and i get those terrible under-skin, hormone-triggered pimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the nuetrogena acne-prone face bar for more than half a year with no issues, than one day had a terrible allergic reaction where my face was swollen, red and itchy for like a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has since been about 4 months of endlessly searching for a gentle cleanser to remove all my makeup and balance my now terrible skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally bought the moisturizer yesterday that came with a tester size of this stuff. AND YAY!!!!! One wash with its suds removed the scaly skin from my eyelids and made them so smooth. I was terrified that it was going to make the rest of my face too oily, but it felt so clean and refreshed. (not to mention my face looks really hydrated today). I immediately followed with the lotion, which burns at first, but eventually moisturizes perfectly. One day in and I&#x27;m very happy. Would definitely recommend and I will be purchasing a full size bodywash!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really hope this continues to work</li>
    <li> Definitely &amp;#34;calming&amp;#34; body wash!  I use this on my 2 year old who gets real bad eczema flare ups in the winter, with heat and dry air adding to it.  Most body washes for children only inflamed the condition (even those labeled organic, fragrance free, sensitive skin, etc).  So far this is the only body wash that doesn&#x27;t exacerbate the eczema.  It is a little slipper solution than other washes, so my toddler giggles when I wash her with it.  Highly recommend (and put on baby aquaphor on affected areas right after bath).</li>
    <li> This is amazing stuff! I have been using it on my infant son, recommended by the pediatrician. He had eczema and this stuff works! It even cleared up his cradle cap. I use the wash and lotion together.</li>
    <li> I have had bad eczema that has really been impressively itchy. This is very easy on those places and I am seeing improvements coupled with cortisone creme.  I am less itchy and feeling better</li>
    <li> Very good products. It&#x27;s a shame how it gets so much expensive in Brazil, where it costs 3 times the price.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin.  Using this has helped my itchy dry skin to make it smooth</li>
    <li> i bought tons of this stuff as my paed said my daughter had exema but then i found out it&#x27;s got some nasty stuff in it http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/search.php?query&#x3D;cetaphil+restoraderm&amp;h&#x3D;Search</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. Didn&#x27;t really see an improvement on my skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried SO many face products, it&#x27;s ridiculous. It&#x27;s hard to find something that I haven&#x27;t tried. I dealt with pretty mild eczema that came and went as I was growing up, usually just on my ears. When I was 16, I started getting it on my eyelids and neck... It would be so red and blotchy and make my eyelids droop and peel and burn and itch... it was horrible. I didn&#x27;t know that it was eczema for a pretty long time, and would try to solve it with other lotions or moisturizers or eye creams, and they all burned and made it horribly worse. Finally, I got some eczema cream that cured it (the aveeno eczema cream), and now it&#x27;s under control. Sometimes if I haven&#x27;t used the lotion in a while it flares up when I wear eye makeup or use different lotion on my neck, but it&#x27;s soon fixed with the aveeno stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, since the first major outbreak of eczema happened, it started to spread up my chin, down my chest, around to the back of my neck and to under my eyes as well... I wanted to try a more gentle face wash that wouldn&#x27;t aggravate it any and found this stuff. I bought both the wash and the moisturizer. They&#x27;ve helped SO much. I like the texture, but for anyone that wants to use this with a clarisonic, it&#x27;s a little bit tough. It really lathers up and makes you blow bubbles when you try to breathe hehe. Also, it really burns my eyes if it gets in them. I try to avoid it, but it&#x27;s not the thickest of washes, and it takes a while to wash the burning sensation away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though it&#x27;s not specifically a face wash, it&#x27;s really helped my face. I&#x27;ve had acne since I was in middle school (now 20), and nothing has worked, including every prescription until the only other option was accutane, and I was much too scared of the side effects to try that stuff. I tried the all natural route, which worked better than anything else, but still didn&#x27;t cure it. This stuff hasn&#x27;t \\&quot;cured\\&quot; it either, but it has helped a LOT. I can&#x27;t think of a time when I haven&#x27;t had more than 5 pimples on my face at a time... and it was always a lot worse during that time of the month. This stuff has really helped me to stop picking at the healing ones that were itchy and bothersome, and just seems to prevent breakouts for me. I&#x27;ve had patchy, dry skin on my face as well, but always assumed it was because of the acne. Since using this stuff, that problem has gone away, and I&#x27;m wondering if a part of my problem with acne was due to eczema and I never knew it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is great. I use it every day and will continue to use it and the moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Leaves my face soft and moisturized.  I use Retin A every other night and my skin can get very dry.  This is amazing.</li>
    <li> I think this is a good product if you have sensitive skin or any skin problems,I love cetaphil products,great for good skincare</li>
    <li> expensive but worth the price, i am currently using it as a shampoo for both my kids</li>
    <li> This body wash is great for sensitive skin.  It cleans well and my skin is never itchy anymore.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Anything I can get from Cetaphil I trust for my skin. I have this stuff all over my house because my skin is so dry and I can put this on easily whenever I need to without a lot of hassle. I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a smell of any kind, I really can&#x27;t tolerate perfumes. I use this instead of make up now, since I can&#x27;t wear anything on my face, at least I can keep my face a little moist and that does help some. Aging is a challenge, this helps.</li>
    <li> Really a great product for helping dry skin issues. Its expensive so I&#x27;m looking for alternatives.</li>
    <li> Best shower body wash especially for dry skin.  Nice foaming action and rinses off very quickly and easily.</li>
    <li> This product helps stop the itching.  If you have dry skin, eczema prone skin, eczema outbreaks, or itchy skin get it.  You won&#x27;t regreat the investment when you find sweet relief.</li>
    <li> In conjunction with Vaniply this body wash totally &amp;#34;restored&amp;#34; my infant son&#x27;s skin to the baby soft skin of birth.  I continue to use this on him because it works.  Tried all the other &amp;#34;eczema&amp;#34; soaps but this one is truly for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I use this as a face wash.  I wanted a simple face wash that would not strip my skin of all of its oils.  I realize Cetaphil makes a face wash but I love the Restoraderm lotion and wanted to used the same formulation on my face.  Keeps my sensitive skin from being overly red.</li>
    <li> The product came as promised in a timely manner and in perfect condition. I would recommend the seller and order from them again. In terms of the product it is a good alternative to soap and the product is still being used. However in terms of stopping the itching it did not help much and I have been using another product instead for the itching-in other words now this plus something else. Whether it is just my condition or the product I cannot say but this is not the fault of the seller,who I would order from again.</li>
    <li> My baby has sensitive skin &amp; shortly after he was born, he developed dermatitis from various allergens. I tried multiple \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; baby products with no luck, then after a lot of researching, I found cetaphil&#x27;s restoraderm line of products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that there&#x27;s no fragrance &amp; that a little body wash goes a long way. I use it on my baby&#x27;s entire body in his tub &amp; the wash rinses off easily &amp; doesn&#x27;t leave behind a funky residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use the restoraderm lotion on his body &amp; face when his skin is irritated, but for daily use, I use aquaphor + original cetaphil on his face &amp; original cetaphil on his body.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended I use this to help prevent drying of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;It works great! Lathers nice, cleans good, no drying of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I like it so much I signed up for the auto-ship plan.</li>
    <li> My child&#x27;s doctor recommend it to me. I like this product because it&#x27;s gental on there skin. I recommend it if your child has eczema.</li>
    <li> The world&#x27;s most perfect bodywash. If they made it antibacterial,  I would give it 100 stars!</li>
    <li> Useful on eczema for my husband and father - have this on a subscription plan through Amazon</li>
    <li> An excellent product. It provided immediate dermatitis relief. I will purchase again if necessity requires me to do so.</li>
    <li> got rid of my infants cradle cap almost immediately. I was bathing her with burt&#x27;s bee&#x27;s but it was just drying her scalp even more. I tried dandruff shampoo which is harsh chemicals and that didn&#x27;t help much. Once the dr recommended Cetaphil, it worked after 2 baths. Now I use it for both kids every bath to keep their skin moisturized in this dry weather.</li>
    <li> ...getting clean, something that must be accomplished, is tough on our skin...most soaps get us clean and brittle...over the years we tend to dry out, wrinkle out and finally get out...make the journey easier with this cleanser...the one by Cerave is superior...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000YJ2SKM B000YJ2SKM]]</li>
    <li> I know there are other brands that claim the same results as Cetaphil, but few beat this for a body wash for kids with eczema.</li>
    <li> Recommend by my doctor. Seems to be workkng</li>
    <li> Light lather but doesn&#x27;t strip the skin. Will buy again. Use with the lotion.</li>
    <li> Great for my son&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a perfume-y smell, but it does keep my skin moisturized and free of eczema. This is especially helpful for those days I forget to wear the Cetaphil eczema lotion.</li>
    <li> This really works! My son has very sensitive skin and would break out in rashes easily. He uses this soap and when it&#x27;s really bad we use the Cetaphil lotion after a bath. For the last year he has been able to just use the body wash and hasn&#x27;t had a single break out.</li>
    <li> Been using this for years.</li>
    <li> Worked well for a while but for the price, I would probably just use Cetaphil soap.</li>
    <li> Excellent for dry skin</li>
    <li> This has definitely improved the eczema on my sons body, just wish it came in a bigger bottle! It definitely needs to be used in conjunction with good lotions in order to keep the eczema under control.</li>
    <li> My son has been using these for years and his skin is now flawless. A little bit expensive though.</li>
    <li> I use this with Cetaphil Restoraderm lotion and I can&#x27;t believe the difference in my skin! I don&#x27;t have eczema, just extremely sensitive skin. I used to have red, stingy, raw patches of skin all over my body. No more! My skin is soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Helping with the itch. Skin feels soft after use. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Good to clean your skin</li>
    <li> This works well for my kids with very dry skin. I also use the lotion in addition, which keeps their skin smooth instead of bumpy.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have eczema, but I bought this body wash after reading some reviews claiming that it helped people get rid of their body acne (bacne, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this entire bottle and I can&#x27;t say I really saw any noticeable improvement on the acne on my chest, shoulders, or back. Not only that, but this bottle is pretty small despite the relatively high price tag on it and it doesn&#x27;t lather well at all which makes it hard to spread around without using huge globs (which means you&#x27;ll empty out this small bottle pretty quickly...)</li>
    <li> My 3 year old has really dry skin this winter and now has patches of eczema.  I got this to use until it clears up and he hates it, cries and says it stings. i had ordered the moisturizer and just requested a refund and to cancel it.  Using some things recommended by a friend instead.</li>
    <li> I developed mild eczema last year. Luckily it is only isolated to the inside of my elbows. This body wash really didn&#x27;t do anything that a normal body wash wouldn&#x27;t do. It doesn&#x27;t foam up as well as a regular body wash and it definitely doesn&#x27;t offer any itch relief, even after applying the Cetaphil Restoraderm lotion post-shower. I will not be purchasing this again and cannot recommend for eczema relief.</li>
    <li> Soothing and some relief from rash.</li>
    <li> My 4mth old baby was seriously having some dry skin..although the pediatrician told me it can be dry skin or a mild case of eczema (wasn&#x27;t any help really). Anyways I tried the Aveeno wash &amp; lotion and the next morning my poor baby&#x27;s body had broken out in tiny red bump. It looked awful. It was either her body was not used to trying something different (she&#x27;d been using Aquaphor cream &amp; body wash for almost 3mths) or she had an allergic reaction to the ingredients in the Aveeno products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways I finally received this and tested a spot on her skin..no reaction the next day. So I went ahead and washed &amp; lathered her up. The body wash isn&#x27;t too soapy but more creamy and it feels smooth. No high scent of the sort. And seriously her skin does not feel so rough or dry as before and that is with 1 day of using it along with the moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;Day 3 of using this product on my baby along with the cetaphil moisturizer lotion and seriously...her skin looks and feels TERRIFIC.&lt;br /&gt;The rough dry patches have disappeared and her skin is smooth as a baby&#x27;s should be. Her face has dramatically cleared up, as compared to the fine bumps and red patch on the right side ( can&#x27;t say for sure if it was eczema or skin dryness/rash)&lt;br /&gt;This product definitely has my vote for being a great body wash for babies...</li>
    <li> My baby had eczema for many months...using this body wash along with the lotion had made it dissapear.&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and it was recommended by the pedeiatrician</li>
    <li> My dermatologist got me on this along with the lotion.  I had this dark dry patch on my back and I didn&#x27;t know what it was. She told me It was Eczema. don&#x27;t use any more soap on you skin. I been using this for 3 months now with the lotion and  it much better and doesn&#x27;t itch anymore.  It&#x27;s cost but it worth it ... Great product!</li>
    <li> My daughter has eczema and extremely sensitive skin. This works great as a body wash and doesn&#x27;t irritate her skin at all. My only complaint is the price. Even with subscribe and save, the price is a little high for the amount of product you will receive.</li>
    <li> Careful - this stuff contains Methylisothiazolinone - the American Contact Dermatitis Society Contact Allergen of the Year for 2013. You may be trying to clear up blemishes, but if you are allergic to this stuff - it can make them much worse!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients list on Amazon doesn&#x27;t list it, but it is clearly on the ingredients of the bottle I bought here. This stuff can cause eczema like symptoms if you are allergic to it.</li>
    <li> I bought the restoraderm body wash looking for relief for recurring and very annoying Nummular eczema.  After 4 months of trying to treat it with topical steroids this body wash cleared up the condition in just a few days and it has not recurred as long as I contiue using it. ighly recommend the wash.</li>
    <li> I really like to use it especially in the winter then the skin gets dry more than in the summer. Great product for someone that has very dry skin.</li>
    <li> It is fragrance-free, but it has a weird smell! Doesn&#x27;t smell &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; and I would not purchase this body wash again.</li>
    <li> I brought this for my sister this is the inly thing that works for the redness in her arms thank you</li>
    <li> I used this in conjunction with the body wash and it cleared my son&#x27;s atopic eczema (very mild case, usually only during winter months) within a couple of weeks. I also used cortisone cream sparingly (once every few days) during that time. I don&#x27;t plan to use this on a regular basis--to me it is expensive for use as a daily wash. I use Aquaphor baby wash and shampoo, which is a 0 on the EWG website and about $6, on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> Is a bit  expensive but if you have sensitive skin well worth it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This is the only soap that doesn&#x27;t aggravate my niece&#x27;s eczema. She uses this in conjunction with their lotion and it helps control the eczema on her hands. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Appreciate this fragrance-free body soap (wash) on my dry, very sensitive skin.  It is light, has a light foam to it, washes and rinses easily without leaving my skin uncomfortably dry and begging for immediate lotion.  I&#x27;m still using my first bottle, after a month.  While the bottle has a clean appearance, it is opaque, you can&#x27;t SEE how much you have left.  As a 10 oz. sized bottle, it is easy to handle while in the shower.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t help much with my kids exema but it didn&#x27;t make it worse</li>
    <li> This body wash is really nice for dry skin. I have Sjogren&#x27;s syndrome and my skin gets really dry and this body wash (with the Cetaphil moisturizer) makes me soft again!! Love it!!</li>
    <li> Really keeps the moisture levels in.  I use this at the end of my shower and it hydrates and softens my skin.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way</li>
    <li> Very good body wash for eczema</li>
    <li> Great product, I use it on my son in the shower and it is very moisturizing but rinses clean. I&#x27;ve been using it in conjunction with the restoraderm body moisturizer and have had great results. His eczema isn&#x27;t completely gone but it is greatly minimized and under control with the use of these products.</li>
    <li> my newborn son had really bad patches of dry skin. My pediatrician recommended this product and it has done wonders for his skin. I highly recommend this for newborn babies</li>
    <li> Great body wash!  This was recommended by our pediatrician and has worked great to reduce/remove bumps on our baby&#x27;s skin due to eczema.</li>
    <li> I use this all time now that I am older.</li>
    <li> i got this because i had read one review on how it had helped with facial acne. I had also recently discovered that my skin was extremely sensitive and all these products i was trying was just eating away at my skin and causing me to break out more. My acne is now 95% gone. I still get the occasional pimple but i dont even care! I use this when i get home before bed and i use it to take my makeup off, and i like to put honey on my face as well which is antibacterial and helps with any inflammation, which i always seemed to have.  And after all this money i spent on acne products.. Who knew it was this simple? Overall, great product. It lathers nicely and doesnt strip the skin.</li>
    <li> The fluid is very foamy and easy to apply. I just love the delightful scent the prodect has, even thought it comes without frangrance.</li>
    <li> I love this body wash.. it moisturizes like nothing I have ever used before.. I feel clean and soft when I get out of the shower.</li>
    <li> I have severe outbreaks of eczema and very sensitive skin. This product was recommended by my dermatologist. It is the only cleanser I use now. Bonus, a little goes a long way. Follow up with its companion product, Restoraderm Skin Restoring Moisturizer.</li>
    <li> We tried several different body washes before settling on this one.  The oatmeal one actually made my daughter&#x27;s eczema worse!  This one is gentle and helps clear the eczema up.  Very pleased and will continue to purchase on subscribe and save.</li>
    <li> perfect for managing my son&#x27;s eczema</li>
    <li> I bought this on the recommendation of my doctor for dry skin.  I didn&#x27;t see any significant improvement and it was expensive.  I&#x27;m using an Aveeno body wash now that was half the price and works much better.</li>
    <li> Bought this after liking their Restoraderm lotion. Smells, looks and feels like Ivory dish soap.  I use it for my son who gets really dry skin which leads to scratching and raw sores.  I don&#x27;t think it does anything to help dry skin.  It is just a bare bones (overpriced) soap with nothing extra in it (at least I think so, I am not reading the ingredients).  It&#x27;s okay.  I will stick with the lotion.  There are cheaper alternatives out there for soap.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended for kids (or anyone) with skin sensitivities. Fast shipping and great price!</li>
    <li> I have spent countless hours researching and trying fragrance- and dye-free products for my baby.  She started developing mild eczema at 3 months of age, partly from lousy family history and partly from the dry California air. Since I know how miserable I am when I have eczema relapses and end up drugging myself with Benadryl, I wanted to nip this as soon as possible. The Cetaphil is really mild and moisturizing.  It lathers on nicely and rinses off easily.  I use this along with the Cetaphil Restoraderm Skin Moisturizer.  It only take a small amount of body wash but is still quite expensive for the small amount of product you get.</li>
    <li> A very good product for atopic babies and adults. More expensive when bought in the drugstore or target or walmart.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter who suffers from a small patch of excema on her ankle. We saw dramatic improvement in a week when used with the complementary lotion.</li>
    <li> Best I have found for dry skin.  Includes an ingredient that affects a protein missing in some people with dry skin (per manufacturer).</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot. I was looking for a liquid cleanser to use in the shower that would suds up like regular liquid bath soaps do.  This product is recommended by the eczema NEA Seal of Acceptance organization.  I was looking for a cleaning product that would be as similar as possible to regular liquid soaps but wouldn&#x27;t be so harsh on the skin.  Other Amazon people answered my questions about how or if the product had a sudsy consistency to it.  Those answers prompted me to try it.  Will continue using it.  Expensive as liquid &amp;#34;soaps&amp;#34; go, but it is especially kind to my skin.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff. Bought for my daughter to use and she loves it. It keeps her skin moisturized</li>
    <li> Great product have been using it on my daughter for more than 6 years now for her skin condition and is the only product that helped</li>
    <li> love the creamy texture. works great for sensitive baby skin. i also use it as a face wash sometimes, and it feels great on my face.</li>
    <li> Calming BODY WASH cleans skin, scalp &amp; hair without stripping, and protects from outside irritants.  Calming BODY MOISTURIZER further softens, moisturizes and protects.  Bottles are virtually identical EXCEPT Body Wash has a blue flat flip-open cap &amp; says Body Wash on a blue label.  Moisturizer has a blue pump-top cap &amp; says Moisturizer on the green label.  Currently the product page for Cetaphil Restoraderm Eczema Calming Body Wash shows an image of the moisturizer bottle by mistake.  I buy both products through Subscribe and Save but on different ship frequencies because I use one faster than the other. The images are teeny-tiny on the Manage My S&amp;S Orders page. I have clicked on the pump-top image thinking I was re-ordering the moisturizer, only to receive body wash.  It&#x27;s okay; I&#x27;ll use it but I needed the moisturizer first!  I advise clicking on &amp;#34;edit subscription&amp;#34; EACH TIME you manage your subscriptions. That will open up the product page where you can read the TITLE/DESCRIPTION so you can verify which product you are managing. Both products are total life-savers for my eczema.</li>
    <li> Only thing I didnt like it wasn&#x27;t sealed I bought shampoo it was sealed closed under the cap. However its a great product.</li>
    <li> This smells very strange and like chemicals.  It is supposed to be unscented, so am wondering if it had expired and gone bad.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. My baby has had eczema and has outbreaks all the time. Since I started using this combined with the lotion has made a huge difference!</li>
    <li> A great product. I have seen a big improvement in my dry  skin.&lt;br /&gt;No more itching. I use it with body lotion.</li>
    <li> Managing eczema for a lifetime, this product was perfect.  I used Cetaphil soap, and moisturizer for years, and never knew there was a body wash.  I love that it&#x27;s creamy and gives me another option than the soap.  No complaints. I bought a bottle for my Dad, he loves it too.</li>
    <li> Great to gently get chlorine off after a swim.</li>
    <li> I wish this product contained more natural ingredients (as some can be irritants).  But, with that said, this product does help with eczema.  It requires quite a bit for a lather, and is a relatively small bottle, so it doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
    <li> very sensitive skin responds well and has not caused any irritation</li>
    <li> My Hubby was treated for psoriasis for many years. We tried everything. I saw this on amazon and gave it a try.  we are on our 3rd bottle!! His skin is almost back to normal. It worked on what Dr&#x27;s said was psoriasis.....</li>
    <li> Since I use the Cetaphil Lotion for sensitve skin I thought the Cetaphil body wash would be the ideal compliment.  Not so.  This is no good for my sensitive face.  I now have a sunburned looking face until it calms down a bit.  Since I don&#x27;t have Ecema, perhaps I expected too much.  I will continue to use the lotion to moisturize but I will not use the Body Wash.  My friend, who also has sensitive skin, suggested I try the goats milk soap.</li>
    <li> Moisturizes very well without drying or irritating the skin.  Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> My son had terrible eczema all over his stomach and the inside of his elbows and knees as an infant. Our son&#x27;s doctor recommended this product as part of his skin therapy and it really made a huge difference. He&#x27;s two years old now and the eczema isn&#x27;t a big issue anymore (only shows up now on the inside of elbows and knees when air is too dry) but we still use it because it helps maintain the moisture of his skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son, he has it on his arms and legs.  This product helped his skin to peel off the dead skin quickly and revealing softer skin...u must use it regularly and it goes with the body wash.  I would recommend this product as nothing else worked.</li>
    <li> My 5-year-old has terrible eczema and normal body washes and hand soaps give her a terrible rash. This has been an amazing solution!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s help a lot with my 1 n half yrs old baby with eczema. I apply it after I help them taken showered everyday ... It&#x27;s getting better now</li>
    <li> For a body wash it is more like a body lotion. A little bit does not go a long way. I bought this for my significant other and he ends up using a lot of the bottle in one wash just to make sure it gets everywhere. Cetaphil is really good for helping dry irritated skin but this body wash is misleading and expensive for what you can get out of it.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this when he feels an Eczema attack coming on. Works great! Really wish it came in a bigger size!</li>
    <li> Both my kids have eczema and use this body wash.  It really helps reduce the cycle of the itching/scratching my son as been experiencing since age 2.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!!!! I was using Aveeno eczema wash, but I do like this one more... The aveeno seems hard to wash off.</li>
    <li> So far I like this product well enough. I purchased it to help treat my moderate body acne, but haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice any significant changes yet. It&#x27;s a creamy wash which lathers really well and seems to be gentle enough to use on the face (which I do on occasion, but not daily). It definitely leaves me feeling clean and fresh and makes my skin very soft. My only complaint is that is does dry your skin out a bit (not too bad) and has a somewhat medical/chemically smell.</li>
    <li> I have extreme eczema, and this cleanser is so gentle and soothing on my skin.  I really love it!  Worth the money.</li>
    <li> Smelled weird. Didn’t like the smell but it had great reviews so I thought it was just me. Gave it to my son to use, his skin started itching. Maybe I got a bad batch?</li>
    <li> Nice lather, little scent.  Perfect!</li>
    <li> This product gave a huge relief to my son&#x27;s itchy and dry skin due to eczema. I&#x27;d recommend this even for daily/frequent use.</li>
    <li> This is what my dermatologist said I had to use and it works.</li>
    <li> I like this body wash. It is concentrated so you don&#x27;t have to use very much with each use. It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.</li>
    <li> Only one word. Excelent. My doughter that has eczema uses it every single day and it realy make her skin better.</li>
    <li> I have used tons of different products for dry, itchy skin. This is my favorite. I like it best in the winter. I really like the texture and feeling using it. I use it with some kind of body poof or loofah.&lt;br /&gt;It feels great on your skin while you shower and I like knowing I&#x27;m not drying out my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> Everything ok with this soap until now, it was a very good purchase, for my 2 year old daughter who has dry skin both the soap and moisture works just great.</li>
    <li> i think i prefer the normal Cetaphil&lt;br /&gt;this one is too liquid and don&#x27;t see the reason to pay more.</li>
    <li> Helps a lot with allergy-related skin problems. Definitely give it a try, it is probably the best thing out there for eczema and hives. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> My kids have sensitive skin and the mainstream soaps and bodywashes leave parts of their skin dry and prone to rash.  Used to use more expensive body wash but was glad to find this slightly more affordable option.  Works good and provides more value than some of the other more expensive sensitive skin washes I previously used.  Highly recommended</li>
    <li> This a wonderful product.  I initially received a small bottle as a sample from my dermatologist to help my eczema-like rashes on my body.  I&#x27;ve used it for a few months and my skin is clear and soft.  As an elderly man my skin was thin and brittle.  The is remarkable improvement since I stopped using soap and used Cetaphil exclusively.  I don&#x27;t wish to be indelicate but there is another important benefit to me.  I have mild hemorrhoids and was plagued by the usual itching and burning.  Since eliminating the use of soap and using cetaphil that problem has completely  gone away for which I am thankful.  I don&#x27;t like to be a pitchman for any product but I must recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great for my skin and family&#x27;s delivery was super fast nice</li>
    <li> Cetaphil is my absolute number one body wash and has been for a long time. It really cleans and hydrates my skin all over my body. And, as it say in the name, it helps to relax me and leaves me feeling nice and calm and ready for bed after my bath. I recently added  Skingenixx Face Moisturizing Cream [[ASIN:B00VSCKY1E Skingenixx Hyaluronic Acid Facial Moisturizer.]] to my skincare routine and it is fabulous – my neck &amp; face feel softer and smoother than they ever have -- and it really gets rid of fine lines and wrinkles too Love these products and definitely recommend them.</li>
    <li> I wanted something that I could use in grandson&#x27;s bath water that would not irratate his Eczema. Seems to work very well even at a very young age too.</li>
    <li> use it for my baby to shower</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Its amazing. Will order again.</li>
    <li> Been using this for my daughter since she was 6 months old as recommended by the pediatrician.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its really good for her, its very mild on her skin and does not dry it out at all. Keeps my baby/toddler&#x27;s skin smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have really dry skin I would recommend this to you, else not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t like the smell much, but I add a few drop of lavender oil when giving my baby a bath.</li>
    <li> I suffer from eczema and decided to try this out after reading great reviews about it on Amazon. The product itself has worked great, my skin is not flaring up as much and it feels hydrated. The only complaint I have is when I received this item it came by itself with no additional packaging and the bottle was extremely dirty. It almost gave the impression like it was tampered with or the product had been sitting on a warehouse for a very long time. I didn&#x27;t return it because I thought it wasn&#x27;t worth the hassle, but I definitely did not like this and it made me feel uneasy about the product.</li>
    <li> I though it would work for my sensitive skin but it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Great skin conditioner, moisturizes and smooth on the skin, almost plumps it up for youthful look, Love it!</li>
    <li> Cetaphil makes the best products for Eczema I&#x27;ve ever used and that includes prescription products.  The more I use it the better it works.</li>
    <li> This stuff is like bathing in milk! It has helped calm my eczema. I recommend it highly!</li>
    <li> Our toddler has a fair bit of baby eczema which can keep her up at night.  Until we found this product, we&#x27;d have bad breakouts after using cheap bubble bath or swimming.  The restoraderm has reduced her dry skin to the point that we almost forgot what it was like before.</li>
    <li> Purchased for elderly relative on recommendation of her dermatologist.  Months later, she reports it helps a lot and plans on reordering routinely.  Recommended!</li>
    <li> Use this since the doc recommended for dry, winter skin.  Nice lather, good knowing I am helping my skin with extra ingredients.  Highly recommend Cetaphil products.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. Smells funky. Probably wouldnt spend this much money again</li>
    <li> I liked the honesty of the buyer. I liked the quality of the produc.I liked the quality of service recieved.</li>
    <li> I purchase it for my granddaughter. It works fine. I will be getting more and the prize was good. Will recommend</li>
    <li> I have skin that is super dry, especially in winter. This cleanser is gentle and doesn&#x27;t dry my face out.</li>
    <li> As I have gotten older my skin is very dry and itchy. This product allows me to have suds when I shower and there is no itching&lt;br /&gt;or feeling dry after using this product.</li>
    <li> Bought this after an allergic reaction left me with an all over body rash for about a month. I wish I bought this earlier! Every single body wash I owned left my skin tight, dry, and even more itchy. I noticed a difference after using this body wash ONCE. It&#x27;s unscented, but it definitely has a certain smell to it- not great, but not awful. I was expecting this to be very rich and creamy and leave a film of some sort on my skin; almost like those in-shower body lotions that were all the rage five years ago. I was surprised when I put it on a loofah and it created a light, airy, long lasting foam. You don&#x27;t need much! I got out of the shower and my skin felt clean and normal. It wasn&#x27;t dry, yet it wasn&#x27;t greasy. I put my usual body oil on afterwards and I ended up using way less than I had been when I was using other body washes. Best part-no itchiness and my skin feels soft, rather than dry and leathery. I can see myself using this long after my rash clears up. Also, if you didn&#x27;t read the ingredient list, shea butter is number two on the list! Can&#x27;t go wrong with shea butter!</li>
    <li> For my toddler&#x27;s eczema, we use this, plus lotion, plus a little bit of tea tree oil and he&#x27;s a happy camper.</li>
