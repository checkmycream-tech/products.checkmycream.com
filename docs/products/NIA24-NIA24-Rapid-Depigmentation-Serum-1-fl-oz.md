<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I use it twice a day in morning and before I go to bed.  My blotchy red skin coloration is completely gone and skin has a youthful glow! ... I&#x27;m 67 and look years younger.  The one ounce lasted about 5 weeks and I have reordered the product.</li>
    <li> I personally did not get much benefit from this product as far as peeling &amp; clearing pigmentation...didn&#x27;t work well on my skin</li>
    <li> This is great for eliminating dark spots in a short amount of time. I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is great!  There is a noticeable improvement in the texture of my skin.  I use all of their products.</li>
    <li> This product was not what I expected, the product composition is inconstant, extremely watery, and has a bad odor to it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product hoping it would be as advertised.  To my mind, the results I&#x27;ve seen are exactly as advertised.  I have tried other products and have not had satisfactory results.  This product worked over weeks not months.  The spots were lightened enough that  I am quite happy with the results.  I wasn&#x27;t sure my eyes were seeing these results correctly so I tried it on two dark spots on my arms - excellent fading results and quickly too.  I also tried it on a spot left from surgery under my chin (8 yrs. ago) and that is gone now too!  You only need a tiny amount - so the cost is minimal when you factor in how long this will last.  I have used it on all areas of my face - it is very gentle but I am getting the results I desired.  I highly recommend it.  I am a user of all products made by NIA 24.  I have rosacea and my dermatologist recommended this to me several years ago.  The rosacea is in check and I will not use any other product on my face.</li>
    <li> My complexion is clearer with less discoloration and fine lines.  I would definitely recommend this product, as well as all NIA24 products.</li>
    <li> I do not see any results after using product for 6 weeks.  I am disappointed  &amp; would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> his product makes your face very oily without any results other than a shiny face at night.  I used it for 2 months and can guarantee having an oily face. save your money</li>
    <li> I used a whole bottle and did not notice any change of a spot I have on my right cheek, even though the name is &amp;#34;Rapid Depigmentation&amp;#34;. My skin is oily and it seems to control the oil. Not sure if I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> Not very rapid.  I didn&#x27;t see any results.</li>
    <li> This product is phenomenal for this battling acne scarring and hyperpigmentation.  Please ask your dermatologists for their recommendation and how this pairs with your regimen.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist. Saw a difference in dark spots within days. Even my friends commented on the change. Love it.  Bought the spot repair - can&#x27;t wait to try it.</li>
    <li> This product really helps to lessen the appearance of sun spots. Worth the money</li>
    <li> I like NIA24 products and have seen some reduction in redness using the skin strengtheners and sunscreen products.  This rapid depigmentation serum is expensive.  I don&#x27;t mind expensive if I get to enjoy some results, but this product fell short.  I even tried a second bottle at the advice of an aesthetician I have worked with.  Not a go.  My sun damage is mild-moderate.  I&#x27;m 39 years old, very few deep wrinkles just more uneven pigmentation and some spots that are stubborn.  Perhaps if you are younger and have extremely mild pigmentation it would work better.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle but this product didn&#x27;t even deliver what it promised to.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple of years and usually love it. In fact, it usually works so well I only use 1 pump once a day. It typically lasts 3-4 months. I usually purchase from a dermatologist&#x27;s office. This bottle did not even last 2 months. As well, I did not see the usual efficacy, or any efficacy, that I am used to. Not sure if this was a bad batch or what but I am not reordering. While I understand that prices a far more reasonable here than buying at a medi spa or doctor&#x27;s office but I feel a little duped. Now that I am not using anymore, in a few weeks if I feel like something is missing and I see a difference for the worse I will update. Only time will tell.....</li>
    <li> I like the product yet it is pricey for minimal results. Works best with other NIA24 products. I guess as any person with melasma we hope a product would make it disappear and that didn&#x27;t happen. But I can say it hasn&#x27;t gotten worse. Use tons of sunscreen.</li>
    <li> It really does improve skin texture and pigmentation damage. I have tried other products in the past which didn&#x27;t work as well</li>
    <li> Love this product! Noticeable difference with first use. The serum brightened the skin and provided additional hydration. I use Nia 24 products exclusively and love the results.</li>
    <li> The NIA24 Rapid Depigmentation Serum when used with other NIA24 products helps quickly fade dark marks.  These products really help with pigmentation issues without side effects and irritation.</li>
    <li> Light texture and rapid absorption. Can be used alone in summer time.</li>
    <li> It feels good, but no change to my skin. I already use other NIA24 products, and they worked good on my face, so I thought I&#x27;d try this \\&quot;rapid de-pigment cream\\&quot; on my arms... so far . . . NO change... but maybe it just isn&#x27;t that rapid?? I will keep trying it.</li>
    <li> RAPID DEPIGMENTATION SERUM IS SOFT AND GENTLE TO MY SKIN. WHEN I WAKE UP IN THE MORNING I NOTICED MY SKIN IS BRIGHT AND RADIANT. FEEL LIKE A MILLION BUCKS. MY FACE LOOKS GREAT ALL DAY.</li>
