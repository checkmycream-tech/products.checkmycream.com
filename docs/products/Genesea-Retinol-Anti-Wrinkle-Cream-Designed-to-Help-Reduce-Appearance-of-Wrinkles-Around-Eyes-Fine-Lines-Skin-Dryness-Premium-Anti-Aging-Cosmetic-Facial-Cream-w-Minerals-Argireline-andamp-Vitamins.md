<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Really not sure not done anything yet</li>
    <li> Love these lotions. Have tried the oils before and knew they were effective, but creams are much less messy. Feels great and works on the skin.</li>
    <li> Feels great on the skin...Great company to buy from</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about three weeks. I like the way it makes my skin feel. It does seem to have a tightening effect around my eye area, but I don&#x27;t think I have used it long enough to tell about the long term effects. I do have very sensitive skin and this product is very gentle. I have not had any irritation at all. I will order this product again.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve tried many but this is the best!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it everyday for almost a month and the results are minimal. But I do love the smell and that it is diminishing some of my wrinkles. I was looking for something with a more dramatic effect than this but this still is a good product.</li>
    <li> My wife &amp;#34;suggested&amp;#34; I get this for her for a gift. She keeps talking about how amazing it is, hence the review.</li>
    <li> Not being familiar with the Genesea Brand, but liking the price, I decided to take a chance and buy this item.  You see, my wife just turned 40 (shhh, you didn&#x27;t hear it from me), and she was looking for an alternative to the $100 items that are out there.  We are both glad that I am so smart and purchased this product!  It works great and as advertised and described.  Like it says, you have to give it a few weeks, but results are noticeable after that time.</li>
    <li> THIS CREAM IS NOT WORKING FOR ME, AT ALL.</li>
    <li> I have been putting the anti wrinkle cream on my face and the first thing I noticed was that it was not oily. My wrinkles appears softer and the bags under my eyes have flattened and it&#x27;s a little over a week. Most creams I have used in the past really had no results which was dissappointing.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Thus Cream Felt Smooth as you rub it on you face not ruff and gritty like some facial creams. I noticed a change in my skin within 24 hours of using Genesea. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Genesea is an amazing wrinkle crème.  It does soften wrinkles, absorbs easily, and leaves my skin feeling smooth and silky.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for the past 2 weeks now and it is handling the dry areas of my skin very well. It leaves my skin feeling soft and well moisturized without any greasy feel - that is a big plus for me. This cream is a keeper and is much better for my skin than many other creams I have used thus far. I plan to continue using it to possibly take care of any fine wrinkles as they develop. Right now it is helping my dry skin - help I need in the dry climate I live in.I would definetly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I really love this prodiuct! First of all the packaging is just beautiful, I could leave it on my bathroom counter and be proud as if it&#x27;s a decoration LOL. Second It arrived very quickly which was nice! It kept my face moisturized all day even after I spent two hours in the gym! A little after it dried it seemed to cover the dark circles under my eyes due to lack of sleep! I am very happy with this product :) Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> Noticeable results after only a short time. Was a gift for my wife and she says it has helped a lot and results after a few weeks are significant.  Will buy again when needed</li>
    <li> Smells really nice but oddly enough it&#x27;s manufactured in Las Vegas, I live here, there is no Dead Sea here....</li>
    <li> Wonderful Anti-Wrinkle Cream.  I&#x27;ve just started using and would recommend it.  I have noticed slight changes in my skin and hope it continues.  There is no bad smell to this product.  And it seems to me it will last a very long time.  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This is a great Product!!! I would diffinantly recomment this product  And it will be my cream for life!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for a few weeks now.  I can see noticeable difference in the texture of my skin and a reduction of lines.</li>
    <li> Wow, love this cream! Feels good. And have noticed my fine lines disappearing! Thanks!</li>
    <li> This cream is my new favorite. it appears to work better than others I&#x27;ve tried the past because it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy weird feeling behind. I actually feel as if my skin texture is better improved and it seemed to take no time at all. I would highly recommend it to you.</li>
    <li> My wife loves her Genesea!  This stuff smells great!  After one week she can tell a big difference.  It is alcohol, paraben and mineral oil free. Lot&#x27;s of vitamins and potassium (the mineral of youth).  Great product!  Highly recommended.  Once again - smells awesome!</li>
    <li> Just received the Genesea moisturizing cream and started using it immediately.  When I apply it to my face it goes on smoothly, absorbs into my skin immediately, and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy.  It also has a lovely smell.  I am a over 50 and have used a lot of face creams before and would recommend this product to anyone.  I will also reorder it after this jar is finished.</li>
    <li> I received my Genesea Anti Wrinkle Cream about a week ago.  I am so happy with this skin product.  I am in my 50s and have lived in the south with plenty of sun exposure.  Over the years I have spent a lot of money on various lotions, potions, whatever to remove the fine lines, dry skin and aging spots.  Most were either greasy, smelled horrible, or made my face feel so tight I couldn&#x27;t open my mouth.  Genesea&#x27;s Boto Anti Wrinkle Cream containing  Vitamins, Dead Sea Minerals and Avocado oil  has worked so well and is priced so reasonably that it is now part of my daily routine because it is working.  My wrinkles and age spots are fading away!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this cream.  The cream itself has a pleasant smell and feels luxurious.  However, when I put the cream on, it enhances my wrinkles instead of softening and makes my face feel really tight instead of moisturized and causes my skin to breakout.</li>
    <li> This product has smooth and silky feel... After I apply it, it seems to keep that feeling for hours. This is the 3rd Genesea product I have tried, I also have the Facial Peel and the Anti-Aging Serum. They all have a fresh, very mild scent. One look at the ingredients will show you, these are very nourishing skin care products. The generous size of the packaging also caught my eye, they will last for a while.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream now for 1 week and really love it. The presentation of the product is one you could expect from one of the high end department store brands at 3 to 4 times the amount of money!&lt;br /&gt;The smell of the cream is very pleasant, I am extremely sensitive to smells and had to abandon using product in the past since I just couldn&#x27;t bear the scent of it. It goes on very smooth, non greasy and soaks into skin fast, so applying make-up on top is easy.&lt;br /&gt;I love that it is mineral oil and paraben free. And the results? Pretty awesome : the lines on my forehead are much less visible, my skin feels so much smoother, firmer and less saggy ( like after a facial - except all the time ) and no need for very costly injections.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend trying this product - you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face cream for 2+ months and it happens to have a good amount of moisture for my face. The consistency is not too rich or thin. Goes on nicely and happens to smells really, really good! I&#x27;ve noticed that a few beauty blemishes are lightening up, which is a nice surprise! I&#x27;ve also seen that the moisturizer has soften any minor wrinkles that I have. Even though I don&#x27;t have much wrinkles (close to none), I&#x27;m 28 years old, I wanted make sure I start a good skin care routine for preventive care. I can&#x27;t wait to see more benefits there is to come as I continue using the cream.</li>
    <li> first I want to say that the packaging of this product is so elegant... I just love how it looks on my dressing table... I love how this product works! it makes your skin smooth so your make up looks flawless! I must say I was surprised because you get so used to products not doing what they advertise! Awesome! will definitely purchase again!  P.S. I almost forgot... I ordered this one day and the next day it was at my door! Lightening shipping! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using lot of face cream. but this one is light, nice on the skin, does not stick and really works. I love it.</li>
    <li> I have tried many products and this one has the best feeling as well as results of any I have tried. It almost feels airy going on, and I am seing results after just 2 weeks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my 64 year old dry skin in one month - it&#x27;s smoother, healthier looking and a slight glow, doesn&#x27;t feel dried out anymore!  LOVE THIS PRODUCT, also use the Regenerating night cream.  I use the Purifying Facial Peeling Gel once a week or so as well.</li>
    <li> I use this on my neck and chest and back of hands.  I love that it lasts all day and my skin looks hydrated and younger.  This is going to be a definite go to product!</li>
    <li> I was doubtful that anything could replace my beloved Lancome.  Thankfully, I was wrong.  This cream has not only smoothed out my skin but it also smells delightful.  It goes on easily and soaks in quickly.  And it doesn&#x27;t take much either.  My 50+ year old skin is much less droopy and saggy just after using if for 5 days.  I use it in the morning and in the evening after washing.  It has overnight, replaced my $800 worth of Lancome products.  Just one cream and eye cream is all I need now!  I LOVE THIS STUFF!  When are you coming out with a sister eye cream?</li>
    <li> I will start with the fact that I am a guy and have never used any of this stuff. But when a friend of mine said I should try it I said what the heck I have been using it for a couple of weeks and I can definitely see a decrease in my wrinkles. It is easy to apply and is not greasy at all. I like it a lot with no complaints.</li>
    <li> Received this about 2 weeks ago and wanted to wait to see how well it worked on a particular wrinkle. Happy to say that this product works like a champ. I have tried using Mary kay product to get rid of this one wrinkle in particular and it didn&#x27;t work. I am extremely happy with the result so far that Genesea Cream has given me. There is a definite reduction on the troublesome wrinkle. I wish I had done a before and after to put up here. Love how smooth and light this is on my face.</li>
    <li> I am 46 and blessed with good skin but even so I have begun to get those little lines around the corners of my mouth, eyes and forehead.  I have been searching for a good wrinkle cream but when I read the reviews for Genesea I just had to try one more.  Wow.  I looked in the mirror and couldn&#x27;t figure out what looked different about me.  Then I realized the lines were gone!  Great product I will recommend this to my family and friends.</li>
    <li> I noticed a big difference right away.  I live in the desert and this cream is great for moisturizing and removing fine lines.  I will buy it again.  My skin appearance is noticably better</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s helped wrinkles yet, but I really like the product.</li>
    <li> My first time using this cream and I am sold. Makes my skin very soft and helps with the blemishes.</li>
    <li> I was looking for the best mositurizer that will improve the wrinkles and fine lines, and this cream is the best so far. I tried Lancolme and Olay but for me this is the best so far. I was amazed of the results. I applied twice a day and it really works for my skin especially on my neck, mouth and around the eyes. Just be careful when you put near your eyes.</li>
    <li> I wrote a review for the complimentary product from Genesea, Night Cream, and as I said, it is wonderful!  I can tell you, however, if you loved that stuff, you&#x27;re going to go crazy for the Anti-Wrinkle Boto Cream!  This lotion is great for all times of the day.  Again, with the cold dry air winter has brought around the past month or two, you cannot do too much to keep your skin hydrated!  The Genesea Anti-Wrinkle Boto Cream is one of the nicest feeling lotions I&#x27;ve ever used.  It smooths on and virtually disappears, but leaves behind the softest, smoothest skin you&#x27;ve ever seen.  I can&#x27;t stop feeling how soft my face is after using the lotion.  Using this lotion during the day and the Genesea Night Cream when you go to bed, you will see healthy, soft, smooth and glowing skin, even in the driest season!</li>
    <li> This container has been dubbed, &amp;#34;miracle in a jar&amp;#34; by my wife.  She immediately saw smoothing touches in her skin while at the same time blending in fine wrinkles.  Her self esteem increased and her beauty radiated.  Cannot say enough about this cream...oh, maybe that the price is unreal compared to much MUCH more expensive equivalents.</li>
    <li> Oh my word I just love this Boto Anti Wrinkle Cream! After just using it for two days, my skin is noticeably softer. I fully expect that those little (age-related) smile and laugh lines will diminish with time. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I actually can see the good results already. Really like it!!...</li>
    <li> A very rich cream.  My skin is softer and line less visible since I started using it two weeks ago.  A great product and I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love this anti wrinkle cream!  Love the way it feels going on ... smoothe and velvety. And love the smell... kind of from the sea and really clean smelling.  It feels great on my face and my skin is looking great.  I have a friend who I haven&#x27;t seen in a while and when we recently visited, she commented on how great my skin looks... I think she got some too!  I&#x27;m 67 (shhhh!) and it really seems to be helping minimize lines.  And compared to some other VERY expensive skin creams, this one is far superior!  Thanks for an awesome product!</li>
    <li> Not a cream person but I am loving this!!  This is amazing!  I have always shied away from face creams because I just can&#x27;t stand the feel of slip and slide on my face.  This is great and it wears under make-up or alone very nicely.</li>
    <li> This product did nothing for me, except moisturize my face.</li>
    <li> Love the feel of this cream. Use it everyday!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this.&lt;br /&gt;She tells me it is working on getting rid of her wrinkles, I cant tell the difference, but if she is happy, so am I</li>
    <li> Smooth.  Good product for the money</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this silky anti-wrinkle cream during the day for a few weeks, and it seems to help with my skin tone and texture.  It isn&#x27;t greasy, it goes on smooth, and the fragrance is very light and refreshing.  Being over 40 I&#x27;m starting to notice a change in my skin, and I definitely needed some moisture with the dry winter heat in our home.  This day cream has helped with the wrinkles and fine lines on my forehead, under eyes, and neck.  You can&#x27;t put it close to the eyes, but close enough that it helps.  This is a very high end product that I&#x27;d recommend to anyone looking to improve their skin texture and tone.</li>
    <li> I think this cream is fantastic!  It has a great look and I have noticed a remarkable change in my skin.  I strongly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Genesea is a great product! My skin looks younger because it&#x27;s firmer and has less visible wrinkles. It&#x27;s very creamy, light in texture and smells clean and fresh. It&#x27;s very moisturizing and lasts all day or night depending on when I apply it. I have put it under makeup and have also applied it before going to bed. The smoothness and even tone of my skin also lets me go without makeup, which I normally would never do. I highly recommend Genesea</li>
    <li> It works!! Start using this as early as you can...</li>
    <li> This feels so good on my skin an after a week of using it I am very pleased. My skin feels soft an smooth..I will definitely buy more</li>
    <li> Ok, I&#x27;m a guy.  But, this stuff works as advertised for guys just as it does for women. If you need a little help with hiding some of your aging- this will do the trick.</li>
    <li> Fast Shipment and great product. Does exactly what it claims!</li>
    <li> Personally, i did not see any difference with the wrinkles at all</li>
    <li> This is a great cream! Goes on smooth and has no smell! I love that the most!</li>
    <li> I love the way my skin feels!  after using this cream for just a week, my skin is smoother and I have to look closer to see any fine lines.  Even my husband has noticed my skin looking better.  Ordering up the night cream too!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen the results I had hoped for yet.</li>
    <li> Need to give it more time.  So far I like it.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a few weeks.  I can see the difference in texture of my skin.  This works great.</li>
    <li> Absolutely a Great Product. leaves your skin soft and wrinkles are almost invisible. Thank you</li>
    <li> The presentation with the beautiful box and jar really got my attention.  All ladies like pretty things.  I opened the jar to a fluffy white cream that had a mild scent.  I found that to be very pleasant and appealing.  The cream goes on nice and silky.  No oily mess.  I can even put my glasses back on after applying.  I have been using this delightful cream for a couple of weeks.  My skin is so much softer and smoother.  The dark skin under my eyes are getting lighter and the wrinkles are fading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A wonderful product that I highly recommend..</li>
    <li> No noticeable change :(</li>
    <li> Silky smooth on the skin, non greasy feel. Nice improvement in only 3rd application so far so good. Great price point</li>
    <li> I enjoy using this product very much. Maybe it is in my mind, but I feel it has made my face feel smother, and also my deep wrinkles aren&#x27;t quite as deep. Wether it is just me because I want to feel better about my looks, but as long as I think I look better, that is all that matters. I have tried many prouducts, but I diffently feel this is the best, if I didn&#x27;t I would not have purchased it again.</li>
    <li> Just received this week but so far so good. I loved the smell, it feels natural and nourishing on my skin,silky smooth, non greasy feel. I&#x27;ll wait few more weeks to see changes but the price is great comparing with other products in the market that are very expensive so definitely will be one of my favorites!</li>
    <li> WOW I have tried the best of the best creams from both my dermatologists expensive creams and the department stores and this is a superb product. I take a lot of pride in looking young and spend a lot at the skin centre on laser and filler etc....This cream works wonders. I am going to stock up.</li>
    <li> I really liked Genesea cream.  I used it everyday and found it made my skin look and feel better.</li>
    <li> I love anything with the healing properties of the Dead Sea. Studies have proven that the high concentration of magnesium in Dead Sea salt is instrumental in improving skin hydration and reducing inflammation; therefore reducing the appearance of puffy eyes and bags under the eyes and wrinkles on the face. Also, further research into the benefits of Dead Sea salt has shown a 40% reduction in the depth of wrinkling! That&#x27;s great news to me! That means I look younger! I received this within 2 days, which is GREAT! I have been using this product for several weeks. The packaging is not only beautiful, but very user-friendly and great for travel too. The first thing I noticed when I opened the jar was the fantastic fragrance...like a fresh summer morning! Genesea feels very silky smooth, and my skin stays hydrated all day long, even during sweating from high-intensity exercise! The cream actually stays on and IN your skin, moisturizing and nourishing it all day long until you cleanse your face! It penetrates my skin perfectly, thoroughly without a heavy feeling or endless massaging to get it to deeply penetrate my skin. It definitely makes me look younger!  Unlike MANY so-called moisturizing creams I&#x27;ve used, this DOES NOT BURN MY EYES! I&#x27;ve spent hundreds of dollars trying to find a cream that doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes, and at last I&#x27;VE FOUND IT! A little bit goes a long way too, so the price is FANTASTIC! You absolutely can&#x27;t beat this product! Love it, and I&#x27;m a customer for LIFE!!! Thank you Genesea!!!</li>
    <li> I have tried alot of products to hide the effects of age, sun, and just being lazy.  I live in Florida and the weather or salt will do havick with your skin.  This face and neck cream has the most pleasant scent.  It is very light and and soaks quickly into your skin.  I have been using Genesea Anti Wrinkle and Genesea Night Firming creams for the last few weeks.  I can see a noticeable difference in the tone and health of my skin.  My pores are less noticeable  and my wrinkles seem to be fading as well.  My new daily routine!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Genesea Boto Anti Wrinkle Cream for about a month and am very happy with it. My skin feels moisturized and softened, which is a great improvement over my usual dry skin. I feel like my wrinkles are diminishing, also. Yay!!! I&#x27;m excited to see what happens in the next few months. Hopefully a goodbye to my washboard forehead. Now that would be a miracle and I would even invest in the company! 😄</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s nothing like having a little assistance with your skin looking better, which makes you feel better and most of all having the comfort in knowing you are protecting your face. This cream has a mixture of ingredients that provides assurance through them acting as a team to give you that look which brings a since of relief as we do change while getting older. The idea you can age graceful through its usage is more than enough in the decision making process to purchase one or more.</li>
    <li> Great Product Mother Loves It&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s Happy So All Is Well</li>
    <li> Appears to be working on my skin.  My skin looks better than it has in a long time.</li>
    <li> It has been about 2 weeks since i received my product. The product arrived fast and in a beautifully designed bottle and box, top of the line classy. I was selected to leave an unbiased opinion. I have been using the product daily since its arrival and have some outstanding results to share. I have been using another high end product (rhymes with antique) for years. Genesea BLOWS IT OUT OF THE WATER!! It feels natural and nourishing on my skin. I see results with the daily use of this product and I feel incredible. It makes washing my face and looking in the mirror joyous. I, without hesitation recommend this product to all, both males and females. It feels fresh going on and is bringing my skin back to life (my smile as well). In my opinion you can&#x27;t beat this product. Go get your&#x27;s and then go tell your friends. Genesea Combined the perfect blend of the earths purest elements and the knowledge and expertise of scientists and truly hit it out of the park. Way to go Genesea, Thank you for bringing back my skin, smile and confidence.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Anti-Wrinkle Boto Cream for almost 2 weeks. I had my last round of Botox over 3 months by now and I&#x27;m usually chomping at the bit to get my next fix...mostly due to looking in the mirror. However, since using this Anti-Wrinkle cream twice daily for almost 2 weeks, I don&#x27;t feel that sense of urgency for my botox fix. My wrinkles are not as prominent. My skin is looking great. I&#x27;m also using the Anti-Aging Night Cream from the Genesea line. I&#x27;m sure in another 2 weeks the improvements will be even greater.&lt;br /&gt;This duo is doing wonders for my skin. Glowing, bright, and my wrinkles are not standing out as they normally do. Love how this product has given me a softer look and is bringing back youth to my skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this wrinkle cream for my fiance because she is always looking for new creams and moisturizers for her skin care. She opened the box and yelped with joy. She has told me for the last couple days that she loves it. So since she is happy, I am happy :)</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see a difference</li>
    <li> My face feels really smooth when I remember to put this cream on. I&#x27;m sure if I used daily I would see better results. I will purchase this cream again.</li>
    <li> Made my face breakout.</li>
    <li> Smells more like a lotion for your body I haven&#x27;t seen any difference</li>
    <li> Love this cream along with the other Genesea products I have purchased.  It is not too strong a scent, which is great for me because i have some sensitivity to scented products.  It goes on smoothly, is not greasy, and I love the way my skin feels afterward.</li>
    <li> I am really loving this face cream. I feels very nice on my face. The smell is wonderful. I have been using this morning and night. It absorbs into my face fairly quickly. I can use it in the morning and leave right away not feeling like my face is greasy. I love the way that it makes my face feel. Very soft and smooth. I feel like my face is already looking nicer too, more vibrant and youthful. Thanks Genesea.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife a while back for her dry skin.  SHE ABSOLUTELY LOVES IT!  Her skin is now moist and smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom!  And guess what?  I&#x27;m the hero for finding it for her!  Win - Win!!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this.  I bought it as a early Mothers day gift, basically because she told me to. Happy mom, happy home</li>
    <li> This just made my skin feel better. Easy to use affordable price. What more can you ask for.</li>
    <li> I love this anti wrinkle cream so much.  I have combination oily/dry skin and the way my skin feels after using it is heavenly.  This is by far the best anti wrinkle cream I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
    <li> Have been using the Boto Anti Wrinkle Cream for about a week now. I have to say I am always a bit skeptical of any of the creams out there, but decided give this one a try because I have been using the Genesea night cream and really like the results I am getting with it. Well, I can honestly say I am very pleased with the results of the Wrinkle cream as well. My skin is not only feeling great, but it is looking great too. I am truly happy with this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been about 3 months that I&#x27;ve used this product and I can say I&#x27;ve really enjoyed it.  It absorbs into my skin very well unlike many.</li>
    <li> I used this product the smell is kind of strong but not bad.. my face feels Smooth and Soft</li>
    <li> I love the way this cream feels on my skin, and it has a very pleasant smell without being overpowering. I have noticed some of my deeper &amp;#34;worry&amp;#34; lines becoming less noticeable. Very happy!</li>
    <li> Bought it for Mom as she is getting older experiences more wrinkles. She absolute loves it, as she is starting slowly to see the wrinkles fade. Hands down it works!</li>
    <li> Love the product! It has a delightful fragrance and its so so creamy and smooth. It doesn&#x27;t sit on the skin it really absorbs nicely and makes your skin feel so soft.  I have been using it for about a month and am seeing some results.  Fine lines are dissapearing and i just feel better about my face. I will definatly reorder when it&#x27;s all gone.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. It has improved the texture &amp; appearance of my skin, taking away the dullness &amp; spots caused by sun damage. I alternative the use with a hydrating cream because it does cause some peeling.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 64 year old woman with dry, very sensitive skin. This is one of the best moisturizers I&#x27;ve found. I&#x27;ve used it in the morning (under makeup) and at bedtime for about 30 days. My skin looks and feels better. No redness or sensitivity. I&#x27;ve repurchased and plan to continue using.</li>
    <li> I am a licensed aethetician of 12 yrs and live in hot Las Vegas where it is beyond dry! and have tried hundreds of creams lotions and potions and have to say I love this cream! It smells fresh and clean goes on smooth and silky and hydrates better than anything i have ever used. You only need a little dab makes the skin look dewy and fresh, which is almost impossible here in vegas and make up glides on top. This is the only product I have tried from the Genesea line so far very impressed, good price point, I look forward to trying some of their other products.</li>
    <li> This great!!!!  I have only used this product 3 times.  It is truly Amazing!  I took before pictures to compare, today I Promise my family and me are in awe!!!</li>
    <li> I love the way my skin looks and feels with this cream. My skin looks and feels younger. I highly recommend it. It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> i tried this cream while in the states, im a massive fan of this product...i hope my friend can ship this product across the pond to the uk for me..i love it</li>
    <li> I have really liked this so far I feel it&#x27;s working  nicely</li>
    <li> I just received this product and I saw instant results. I HIGHLY recommend this. I gave it 4 stars only because shipping was a little slow but otherwise  .. GO FOR IT!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always a bit nervous to try a new skin care product because I do have sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve only been using Genesea BOTO Mineral Cream for about 5 days now but I&#x27;m liking it already.I&#x27;m especially sensitive to parabens and SLS and I&#x27;m glad there are none of these bad chemicals in this product. It has a nice clean botanical scent. The texture is creamy and velvety and it spreads on very easily. It soaked right into the skin without leaving a greasy feeling on my face. When applying my foundation, I&#x27;ve just notice that my skin is much more smooth and silky. The fine lines under my eyes are showing noticeable improvement. This is a high quality product that I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I have used many expensive creams and love the light feel of this one. I am really happy with the price and quality of these products and highly recommend because of this.</li>
    <li> This cream feels so good on your face. It&#x27;s very creamy and luxurious. I just started using it so I&#x27;m not sure yet how it will be on the wrinkles. But, I believe it will work really well. It makes your face feel very soft and smooth. I would definitely buy this again. The scent is also very light. I don&#x27;t like heavy scents and this doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. Love it!</li>
    <li> The cream feels really nice when I put it on, works like the much the more expensive creams I have tried in the past.  Just getting started but am ordering the other products offered.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. I&#x27;m 67 years old and have tried many, many creams over the years. This is the BEST ever.</li>
    <li> Awesome product.  Noticed results in about a week.  Softer skin,  less lines around my eyes and people started complimenting my skin. Will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> very good moisturizer will buy again!</li>
    <li> I have been using the product every day since I received it and have some excellent results to share.  It feels natural and moisturizing to my skin. I see results with the daily use of this product.  I highly recommend this product to all, both males and females. It feels fresh going on and  In my opinion you can&#x27;t beat this product.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. I recommend it. The quality is obvious in the packaging, and the overall feel of the cream.</li>
    <li> Great product!  It left my wife&#x27;s face smooth and she raves on how it makes her feel.  Smells awesome too!  Good job Genesea!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of weeks now and I love it!!  Makes my skin nice and soft without being greasy - and I have very oily skin.  Definitely see improvements in the wrinkle department!!  LOVE the scent too!  Would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> My new skin regimen consists of the Genesea Boto Anti Wrinkle Cream, Genesea Night Cream and the Genesea Purifying Facial Exfoliator. I&#x27;ve never been this completely satisfied! The Boto Anti Wrinkle Cream is lightweight, non-greasy and absorbs well into my skin, no sticky residue at all and feels heaven on my skin. I also love its luxurious light scent. I have combination dry and oily face and this does exactly what it says - hydrates my skin and more! I can&#x27;t wait to see more effective results on my skin! I highly recommend this specially if you are looking for the best skin regimen. I finally found mine!</li>
    <li> Everything this cream claims to be is a LIE. I have used it consistently for 30days morning and night and I have seen absolutely no difference on my skin,. High hopes slowly diminished.</li>
    <li> Questionable ingredients...I can&#x27;t bring myself to put this on my face.  I wish my husband hadn&#x27;t bought it!</li>
    <li> The cream goes on silky smooth. It really does firm and tighten my face. I love this product and will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product. Texture, smell and non greasy are all a plus. Makes my skin look really good. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This cream has made my skin so soft and smooth. I have been using this for 4 weeks and my skin looks bright and youthful. I have used many different products in the past that do not work or change my skin at all ,  this Boto Cream has actually worked I will definitely be using this cream again and I highly recommend you to get it too.</li>
    <li> Bought for my wife. Although she just started using it a couple of days ago, what a awesome difference already.  Amazing product!!</li>
    <li> I bought Genesea Anti Wrinkle Cream to smooth out the fine lines the sun has done to my face for many years. I&#x27;m in sales so putting your best face forward is very important. I&#x27;ve used much higher priced creams in the past that works well, but you can&#x27;t beat the price that Genesea offers. Best Bang for the buck Anti Wrinkle Cream out there!</li>
    <li> Almost eighty so I have used many products that purported to be anti wrinkle including many of the high end creams sold in salons, spas and doctor&#x27;s offices like Glo Therapeutics and Skinceuticals. None of them compare to the Dead Sea Anti Wrinkle Cream that I just purchased right here on Amazon. The price comparison is unblievable as I can now by a product for less than three times the cost of those being touted as the best. The lovely subtle fragrance is pleasant. The cream absorbs quickly and then is never an oily or unpleasant residue. I can definitely see a difference as some of my blotches are fading slowly but definitely seeing a difference. My money will go much further because you use very little of this product to achieve full coverage and the prices are significantly lower than other products on the market. My face feels very soft and is glowing after using this Dead Sea Anti Wrinkle Cream. Thanks to Genesea for producing this great product that uses Dead Sea Minerals.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife. Was skeptical at first, as she has tried other products in the past, with less than stellar results. This product, on the other hand, is another story. Its superior quality shines through from the moment you open Amazon&#x27;s brown outer box. From the classy design of both the box and the jar, to the obvious quality of the ingredients used in making the product itself, to the self-evident results that my wife experienced right from the start, we were truly impressed with this wonderful product. We can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!! I just LOVE it! Finally, a product that works on my dry skin. Too much over exposure to the sun, over 65 years,  has made my forearms feel scaly and this product is renewing them!! I love how it makes my face and neck feel and look! Thanks for a wonderful product!!</li>
    <li> I am 30 years old and have just started experimenting with different anti-wrinkle creams.I have started to notice a few small little wrinkles around my eyes, not much and not very noticeable but  thought it was be about time to start using a good cream. I haven&#x27;t had much luck with the ones I have tried. I have very sensitive skin. But this cream feels amazing and I haven&#x27;t had any bad reactions. The texture is very smooth and literally feels like silk on your face. The fragrance is very light and airy and has a refreshing scent, but nothing to strong or overpowering. It is overall very refreshing on your face and I have noticed a slight change in a few tiny wrinkles.. This is a great price point and I plan to keep using this product. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any significant change, no better than Loreal or Oil Of Olay products. Pricier than those.</li>
    <li> I just got this product...started using it immediately. I really like the way it feels on my face. Non-greasy and leaves my face feeling soft. I&#x27;ll have to see in a few weeks if this product holds up to its name.</li>
    <li> What I love: The light whipped texture, and the rich hydrating feel when I put in on my skin. And, I love the scent, it makes my primping experience so enjoyable. It finishes off non-greasy on my face, which is important for me since I have mixed oily skin. I use this cream in the morning, and then a couple of minutes later I put on my tinted Beauty Balm (different brand) that has SPF in it. So far, with this cream I can tell the fine line wrinkles around the crows feet area of my eye are less noticeable.</li>
    <li> Did not stick with it, as I need a product that provides more moisture.  Using it on my neck to use it up.  However, I have very sensitive skin, and it did not irritate my face.  It just doesn&#x27;t seem to moisturize.</li>
    <li> This product is very moisturizing, and leaves a glow on the skin. My fine lines are diminishing. I only use it as a nite cream.</li>
    <li> Love it!!!  works great and instantly</li>
    <li> Awesome little cream. Ingredients are actually something you can pronounce!&lt;br /&gt;It turns out that it helped drastically reduce the appearance, and soothe  a patch of psoriasis I have had on my neck for quite some time. I am not promoting this cream for the treatment of it, but in my case I could definitely see amazing improvement.&lt;br /&gt;And as of now (naturally) it is out of stock, probably never to be available again.&lt;br /&gt;Sigh...</li>
    <li> I did not like this product at all. It was very thick and felt heavy putting on. Within a week my chin area broke out into pimples. Im 43 and have not had this happen to my skin in over 20 years. Perhaps if you are looking for a very heavy cream this may be a product for you. For me it was not the texture I was looking for and the results were nothing more than a drug store inexpensive brand would provided. Would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using wrinkle cream.  I have stayed away for a long time because I was in denial that it was time to change up my routine.  I love this anti-wrinkle cream.  My skin is well hydrated with this product and I can tell it is making a difference and even improving my skin tone.  Sometimes my face is splotchy (sp?) and this is totally helping!  I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to try it.</li>
    <li> Excelllent product. But disappointing when I went to reorder it says unavailable and not sure when and if it  will be back in stock.</li>
</ol>
