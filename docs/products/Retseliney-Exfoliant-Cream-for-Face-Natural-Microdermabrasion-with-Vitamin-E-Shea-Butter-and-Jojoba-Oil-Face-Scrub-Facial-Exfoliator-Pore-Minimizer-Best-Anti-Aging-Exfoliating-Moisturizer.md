      <li>Find that using this product my serums &amp; moisturizers can better absorb.  </li>

      <li>My skin looked brighter and more refreshed after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;****I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
      <li>Smells nice, non-irritating - worth a try!</li>
      <li>I have pretty good skin to begin with.</li>
      <li>I find applying it to dry skin works best.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for an ingredient conscious microdermabrasion product that won&#x27;t break your budget, this is a great one to try.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product smooths fine lines and is great for sensitive skin - no rash, irritation, or fragrance.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After the exfoliant be sure to follow up with toner, serum and moisturizer for the full benefit of your treatment.</li>
      <li>Wash your face first, then apply this exfoliant cream in circular motions for about 2-3 minutes, then rinse off with warm water.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s full of aluminium silicate, which has been found to be safe by the Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) Expert Panel.  </li>
      <li>this is more like liquid super, super-fine sandpaper for your face.  </li>
      <li>And I am so lucky I did!</li>
      <li>The exfoliation primarily comes from fine silica</li>
      <li>I am really loving Retseliney&#x27;s product line and love that they use natural and organic ingredients.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;(Product provided free for evaluation and unbiased reviewing.)</li>
      <li>will tell you what though, my face felt so smooth afterwards.</li>
      <li>I got to try this (free) for my review.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve had the best results using higher quality exfoliators like this one that have tiny rounded granules because it seems like they do a better job getting a consistent exfoliation.</li>
      <li>I received this free product to review.</li>
      <li>In this video I review the Advanced Exfoliant Cream by Retseliney.</li>
      <li>I love that this has no artificial colors or fragrances</li>
      <li>I got to try this product free for review</li>
      <li>you use it with a Clairsonic type of skin buffer, use a light touch.</li>
      <li>Another important aspect is that it&#x27;s unscented.</li>
      <li>Free product provided for evaluation and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also good to know that this product is 96% naturally derived.</li>
      <li>The scrub granules are super small but, there are so many that they make the perfect exfoliant.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Leaves my skin feeling very clean and fresh, and looking brighter.  </li>
      <li>Wow!  I absolutely love this exfoliant cream!  </li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s clean and fully prepped).</li>
      <li>Those smaller exfoliant particles are more effective &amp; are safer way to exfoliate.</li>
      <li>but I feel refreshed and clean afterwards.</li>
      <li>After rinsing with warm water, my face feels soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>but when you apply you feel lots of grains which deeply clean the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Retseliney exfoliant cream does wonders.</li>
      <li>It rinses off cleanly and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.  </li>
      <li>Then rinse it off with cool water.</li>
      <li>never tried such an amazing product before.</li>
      <li>Retseliney uses a potent 96% natural ingredients in their exfoliant cream.</li>
      <li>and it smelled more natural than like</li>
      <li>The results can be seen in a refreshed and healthy skin by the time the treatment is complete.</li>
      <li>This product has no artificial dyes in it either.</li>
      <li>a powerful cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My face was so clean, soft and smooth that my fingers were going to touch my face again &amp; again.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Unlike many exfoliants this cream is smooth and does not feel like sand, but when rubbing the cream over your face, neck and hands you can actually feel the &#x60;seasoned&#x27; skin that is at the end of its cycle roll</li>
      <li>Do not use during or right after chemical peeling.</li>
      <li>and I only use it occasionally (maybe once a week), but I can say it&#x27;s gentler than most and far more effective.</li>
      <li>That might sound bad, but really, it does a most excellent job.  </li>
      <li>These facial creams offer an exfoliant and antioxidant to leave your skin feeling good as new within days.</li>
      <li>It has these tiny micro particles which help to gently &amp; safely remove that old top layer of skin.</li>
      <li>Afterwards follow up with a toner if possible, any serums, and a moisturizer suitable for your skin type.</li>
      <li>I have generally good skin, but suffer from mild Rosacea and some minor adult acne breakouts on occasion.  </li>
      <li>fruit cocktail masque by Retseliney is a blend of antioxidant berries and if used twice weekly to leave on the skin for 15 minutes will leave your skin and complexion smooth and looking like new.</li>
      <li>I have used quite a few of their different skincare products and continue to be impressed by the quality.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It has a creamy texture that easily cleans away dead skin and leaves you with softer and more smooth and vibrant looking skin.</li>
      <li>It has all the natural ingredients which helps to reduce the fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
      <li>VERY easy to apply and does not take long to see</li>
      <li>cream!I highly recommend it!!</li>
      <li>I have tried many different exfoliators.</li>
      <li>You should only do this once a week, twice at the most.</li>
      <li>First the product: the cream is a combination of shea butter, avocado oil, grapeseed oil, jojoba oil, vitamin E and hemp seed oil.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> **I received this free product to review. I was not required to write a positive review nor was I compensated in any other way. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with the FTC Regulations.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review is on a few products from Retseliney. These facial creams offer an exfoliant and antioxidant to leave your skin feeling good as new within days. The products are featured on Amazon for slightly under $20 and improve skin tone and texture. The products get down under the skin to remove old dead skin cells and clear up impurities. All the products are made of natural ingredients and feature organic product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is white and has no fragrance. When applied to the skin it has a rough, sandy texture to it and if this does not irritate your sensitive skin, then you will find that it removes a lot of the blackheads, whiteheads and dead skin cells that leave your face looking dull and unhealthy. VERY easy to apply and does not take long to see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fruit cocktail masque by Retseliney is a blend of antioxidant berries and if used twice weekly to leave on the skin for 15 minutes will leave your skin and complexion smooth and looking like new. The skin will be even and have less blemishes and feel soft to the touch. I highly recommend these products!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I am a big fan of the Derma E daily microdermabrasion product, and this is quite similar (at a somewhat lesser cost).  I have actually been using this every day and I find that it is not irritating my skin, although you should probably work your way up to that if you are not used to this type of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to get breakouts, sometimes cystic ones, even at my age.  One thing that has really helped is frequent exfoliation.  I am definitely seeing some improvement in my skin, just in the short time I&#x27;ve been using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this in the shower, after cleansing.  (And before toner, serum, and moisturizer, all of which I use after I get out of the shower.)  It rinses off cleanly and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.  The jar is easy to open and close, even with wet hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t notice much, if any, of a scent (though to be fair, my sinuses have been totally clogged lately due to allergies).  I love that this has no artificial colors or fragrances (it&#x27;s also vegan).  I think that the natural oils provide a bit of moisture that helps protect the exfoliated skin (but of course, always use a sunscreen as well!).  The exfoliation primarily comes from fine silica particles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Don&#x27;t scrub too hard with this.  A little gentle massage of your skin with your fingertips is all you need to see an effect.  Scrubbing too hard can lead to redness and irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is looking smoother and feeling cleaner than it has in awhile.  If you are looking for an ingredient conscious microdermabrasion product that won&#x27;t break your budget, this is a great one to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided by the seller for evaluation purposes.</li>
    <li> This is a such an awesome exfoliating cream. It has fine grains which deeply cleanse the skin. It has all the natural ingredients which helps to reduce the fine lines and wrinkles. It removes the top layer of dead skin. I apply it on my face in circular motion and then rinse it off with warm water. My face was so clean, soft and smooth that my fingers were going to touch my face again &amp; again.&lt;br /&gt; It has Vitamin E, Shea butter, jojoba oil, avocado oil, hemp seed oil and grape seed oil which makes my skin really soft. It does not dry my skin after use. The cream is in white color. When you look at it, it does not seem it has anything in it but when you apply you feel lots of grains which deeply clean the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Retseliney exfoliant cream does wonders. I am using other products from the same line and all of there products are amazing.&lt;br /&gt;The Exfoliating cream improves the over all skin texture.  It is paraben free and it is great for all skin types.&lt;br /&gt;I never tried such an amazing product before. My skin is loving it.&lt;br /&gt;The Retseliney Exfoliating cream gives my skin a natural glow by taking the dead skin away and improving the line fines.&lt;br /&gt;I would say you must give it a try and you would love this exfoliant cream.&lt;br /&gt;I was so fortunate to get this awesome product on a promotion to give my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> RETSELINEY is gaining ground in the skin care parade and this new product is a fine example of why that is true. First of all, as with all their products this is a completely natural, organic, paraben free product so it can be trusted. First the product: the cream is a combination of shea butter, avocado oil, grapeseed oil, jojoba oil, vitamin E and hemp seed oil. Unlike many exfoliants this cream is smooth and does not feel like sand, but when rubbing the cream over your face, neck and hands you can actually feel the &#x60;seasoned&#x27; skin that is at the end of its cycle roll off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For best results, cleanse your face first (their vitamin C cleanser is excellent for that step!), the use the toner ad then apply the Exfoliant Cream - a little bit goes a long way and for people with very sensitive skin use as little as possible (you&#x27;ll find your level). Massage it in for a couple of minutes then rinse well and off comes the exfoliant and the dead skin and fine lines begin to disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the company cares about its products and its customers they send along a note that says to use this product on 1 or 2 times a week and do not use on Rosacea, open pimples, open sores or other skin ailments. Do not use during or right after chemical peeling. Avoid contact with eyes and mucous membranes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the exfoliant be sure to follow up with toner, serum and moisturizer for the full benefit of your treatment. Some products have to be used for a week or so before a difference is noted - not with this Exfoliant Cream. The results can be seen in a refreshed and healthy skin by the time the treatment is complete. Highly recommended. Grady Harp, May 15&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was sent to me gratis for an unbiased opinion which I have given.</li>
    <li> I will definitely be  a repeat buyer.  My skin feels and looks smooth and soft are using the product, no redness or peeling that I&#x27;ve experienced for other products that were too harsh for my skin.</li>
    <li> I really loved using this. I used it twice now and I could really feel the tiny scrubbers working to clean my face.&lt;br /&gt;I will tell you what though, my face felt so smooth afterwards. And I mean really smooth. I could definitely feel it being cleaned and more smooth and so soft. I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;It has a creamy texture that easily cleans away dead skin and leaves you with softer and more smooth and vibrant looking skin. And that is my own non scripted opinion.  It also had a small scent but not at all strong and it smelled more natural than like a powerful cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got to try these products free through Tomoson as part of a product trial but the experience and opinions in this post are my own unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:9b202983cd97531d6d03359a39df8ecb]] Retseliney&#x27;s Advanced Exfoliant Cream is aimed towards minimizing fine lines and wrinkles while brightening dull skin. I love a good exfoliator as part of my weekly skincare routine. Retseliney uses a potent 96% natural ingredients in their exfoliant cream. The company itself does not test on animals and many of their products are organic as well. Something I liked about their cream is that it uses a variety of ingredients that are excellent for moisturization, including grapeseed oil, jojoba oil, Vitamin E, Hemp seed oil, shea butter, and avocado oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture of the cream is actually quite thick. I found that I didn&#x27;t have to use much product to actually exfoliate my face well. A 4 oz. container will last quite a while. The cream also has tiny micro grains in it to provide a gentle exfoliation without feeling rough. My skin looked brighter and more refreshed after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.****</li>
    <li> I also had the chance to try Retseliney Exfoliant Cream. They products are vegan approved and made with premium natural and organic ingredients. Wash your face first, then apply this exfoliant cream in circular motions for about 2-3 minutes, then rinse off with warm water. I noticed that my skin was smoother and brighter. This cream isn&#x27;t harsh like a lot of exfoliant creams and washes. If you have sensitive skin only use about once or twice a week. I have become a big fan of Retseliney skin care line.</li>
    <li> As with most physical exfoliants, it is a bit rough on the skin and I only use it occasionally (maybe once a week), but I can say it&#x27;s gentler than most and far more effective. Leaves my skin a bit tight but I feel refreshed and clean afterwards.</li>
    <li> Only used twice so far, but I bought this with other products in this line and noticing increased firmness. Smells nice, non-irritating - worth a try!</li>
    <li> Free product provided for evaluation and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want an exfoliant, this is a good one.  It&#x27;s not like St. Ives or any of those products with beads- this is more like liquid super, super-fine sandpaper for your face.  It&#x27;s full of aluminium silicate, which has been found to be safe by the Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) Expert Panel.  (I&#x27;d never used a  product quite like this, so I looked that up!)  That might sound bad, but really, it does a most excellent job.  It exfoliates my face very well, leaving it looking brighter and smoother.  It&#x27;s not at all drying, and it only takes a bit so the jar is lasting me longer than I expected.  I only use it about once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my skin feeling very clean and fresh, and looking brighter.  I like to exfoliate my face regularly, and, in combination with wearing sunscreen, it helps keep my freckles from looking dark, but it&#x27;s also rather good for anti-aging.  It works great for me.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best exfoliant I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve tried a lot and can be happier with this product. I am viewing other products from this manufacture and will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different exfoliators. Some are made of ground up walnut shells, sugar, tiny beads, pretty much anything course can be used to exfoliate but I&#x27;ve had the best results using higher quality exfoliators like this one that have tiny rounded granules because it seems like they do a better job getting a consistent exfoliation. This one feels almost like tiny grains of sand or pumice. It&#x27;s a pretty strong exfoliant so you should use it with care and don&#x27;t go overboard. All you need is a tiny bit. I like to start with about a pea-size dollop and spread it over your face (after cleansing your face so it&#x27;s clean and fully prepped). Then I wet my fingers and gently massage it in. My face felt so smooth after using this, the tiny granules really polished off all that dull, dead skin and left my face glowing. If it feels too strong for you it helps not to push hard at all, rub very gently and let the scrub do the work. You should only do this once a week, twice at the most. While it is beneficial to exfoliate to keep your skin looking fresh and keep the pore-clogging dead skin at bay you don&#x27;t want to over-exfoliate and make your skin too thin. Afterwards follow up with a toner if possible, any serums, and a moisturizer suitable for your skin type. You want to seal in the moisture after you take off that layer of dead skin.&lt;br /&gt;Retseliney products have become one of my most-trusted go-to brands. I have used quite a few of their different skincare products and continue to be impressed by the quality. This exfoliant cream is no exception. It smells wonderful and made my skin look and feel amazing. It contains beneficial oils so your face will be replenished rather than stripped dry. This jar will last a very long time because of how little you need so unless you start using it on your whole body I can see this jar lasting a year or more.&lt;br /&gt;(Product provided free for evaluation and unbiased reviewing.)</li>
    <li> After using Dr Brandt and the Kate Somerville &#x27;Exfolikate&#x27; exfoliation creams, I like this one just as much.&lt;br /&gt;Almost no scent, and leaves skin soft but feeling clean, not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;If you use it with a Clairsonic type of skin buffer, use a light touch. The tiny beads are small but mighty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very creamy, and after a few uses you notice that skin is a bit brighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLOSURE : Product received to test with the option to review.

    <li> I got to try this product free for review and I love it. It is gentle on my sensitive skin yet works wonders!</li>
    <li> I have use the product for a while hoping for great result, however, the product does not exfoliate my skin well. My skin is not complicated, only have an issue of ingrown hair.  With the product I continue to have ingrown hairs, which is the only reason I require exfoliation.</li>
    <li> I have used other exfoliants but never one with the tiny grains of aluminum silica that Retseliney puts in theirs. I have sensitive skin, so I gently rub it on my face in a circular motion as recommended. After rinsing with warm water, my face feels soft and smooth. I follow with the Retseliney moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I use only a little bit of the exfoliant and it comes in 4 oz container, so will last me a long time. It’s a white cream and I haven’t noticed a scent.  It is made with lots of natural and organic ingredients, and I appreciate that it isn’t tested on animals.</li>
    <li> Absolutely Amazing!  I love this scrub!  The scrub granules are super small but, there are so many that they make the perfect exfoliant.  If you have sensitive skin just gently massage this product on your face.  If you want a deeper exfoliation then just add more pressure and scrub away.  I am really loving Retseliney&#x27;s product line and love that they use natural and organic ingredients.  My skin looks beautiful after using this product and I am sure yours will too!&lt;br /&gt;*Sample provided for review</li>
    <li> Love to use skin care. I am well versed at using facial exfoliators. I have never uses an exfoliant cream, but have uses scrubs. Why do we need to exfoliate out skin?  Using an exfoliation cream helps to shed old dull skin. Retseliney advanced exfoliant cream is rich &amp; thick. It has these tiny micro particles which help to gently &amp; safely remove that old top layer of skin. Removing that old skin helps to show healthier, younger looking skin. Many things that I like about this product. First like that the exfoliant particles are very small. Those smaller exfoliant particles are more effective &amp; are safer way to exfoliate. This product has no artificial dyes in it either. Another important aspect is that it&#x27;s unscented. It&#x27;s also good to know that this product is 96% naturally derived. It&#x27;s safe to use on your skin multiple times per week. Personally I use it every other day. Find that using this product my serums &amp; moisturizers can better absorb.  This cream is thick &amp; rich! Honestly you need about a nickel sized amount for your face and neck. This 4 oz jar should last you a long time. I find applying it to dry skin works best. Take your time and work in small circular motions. Then rinse it off with cool water. My skin does look better, and it feels better. Honestly I have used some very expensive products in past, and this exfoliant exceeds any of those. Love that this product is not tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product complimentary in exchange for an honest &amp; fair review.</li>
    <li> This product smooths fine lines and is great for sensitive skin - no rash, irritation, or fragrance. It&#x27;s also an excellent value - a little goes a long way, the product should last a long time if used wisely.</li>
    <li> I used it for the first time today; my skin felt wonderful after my first use! I am 24 with my hormones going crazy, not sure why, but I definitely felt a difference on my skin immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I continued to use this product, but it made me break out more than I even was. I would not buy this again!</li>
    <li> I got to try this (free) for my review. And I am so lucky I did! I love it!  My skin is glowing!  I have pretty good skin to begin with. So it&#x27;s hard to find anything to really make a difference. But this does! My face is so soft. And I swear I look younger.  Great product! A must have.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:9c2d29c5e6350b1b35bd159b3fd3202d]] In this video I review the Advanced Exfoliant Cream by Retseliney. I absolutely love this exfoliant cream!I highly recommend it!! *I received this product free to review in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion*</li>
    <li> Wow!  I absolutely love this exfoliant cream!  I have been using it twice a week on my face, neck and d&amp;eacute;colletage and my skin is noticeably softer and brighter!  I have generally good skin, but suffer from mild Rosacea and some minor adult acne breakouts on occasion.  I had stubborn bumps near my hairline that normal scrubs couldn&#x27;t eliminate - after using this cream, they are completely gone!  My d&amp;eacute;colletage is smoother and clearer than it&#x27;s been in years - as though I&#x27;ve turned back the clock to my late 20&#x27;s (I&#x27;m 49).  It seems to help modestly with areas of hyper-pigmentation as well.  Highly recommend.</li>
