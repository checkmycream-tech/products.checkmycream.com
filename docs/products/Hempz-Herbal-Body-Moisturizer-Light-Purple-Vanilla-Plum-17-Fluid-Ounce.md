<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love Hemp lotion. great price and recried quickly.</li>
    <li> The only lotion  to stop my dry skin worries !</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. Moisturizes my hands nice and smells lovely</li>
    <li> Great lotion and smells awesome, the perfect consistency.</li>
    <li> Very lovely scent and with the usually great Hempz lotion, they work together for a nice refreshing skin treatment.  Great stuff!</li>
    <li> Did not smell like one I had sampled in my hair salon! I gave it to my daughter, she liked it!</li>
    <li> Got what I ordered at a good price, much lower than retail.  this is a good product with no nasty fillers.  Smells good.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, love Hempz products!!</li>
    <li> This is the perfect body lotion. It can be used in the summer or the winter and the results are nothing but phenomenal. It&#x27;s hydrating and moisturizing, leaving your skin feeling silky smooth.</li>
    <li> I use it every single day....,,love the moisture....love the fragrance .  Coming back for more very soon!!&#x27;</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly, love the product</li>
    <li> Smells awesome and feels great!</li>
    <li> very satisfied with this purchase</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite lotion! Found it at a local store but they wanted $12.99 for it. Purchased it on amazon for a better price. Goes on smooth and does not leave a greasy feel behind. So light I even use it on my face. Must have.</li>
    <li> Best lotion ever smells really good and its a very light moisture love hemp products deffinatly worth the money</li>
    <li> This was 100% surely either expired well beyond the date or a fake. The smell and color was off and it did not go well on the skin. It is worth it to pay the full price and buy it from a salon.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife a couple of times now, and she loves to use it. It has a good scent and also works very well for moisturizing.</li>
    <li> leaves my skin still feeling dry</li>
    <li> Fast shipping love this product</li>
    <li> Exactly as expected. Will order again.</li>
    <li> I checked the ingredients from the recommended link.It has artificial coloring! It would have been great if they did not have to add those. Not good.</li>
    <li> Smells great keeps my skin hydrated which is a must in cold weather.</li>
    <li> I like this lotion for how it moisturizes but the scent is very overpowering.  I went to Ulta to smell some of the other fragrances and they are all very strong.  I won&#x27;t be purchasing again until they have unscented or a much softer scent.</li>
    <li> I continue to use Hempz Vanilla Plum Herbal Body Lotion. I love it. It absorbs well and smells wonderful. It leaves no sticky feeling and I continue to reorder and recommend it to friends. I have tried several of the other products in the Hempz line and have been happy with all of them. Give one a try.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;MB Martini</li>
    <li> I love the smell and how it makes my hands feels :)</li>
    <li> I always like this brand of lotion and the different scents are not too strong or powerful but work great</li>
    <li> Love it!!!! So addicted to this stuff, like my 3rd or 4th bottle purchased since first finding it a few months ago.</li>
    <li> Love this! Works well, and smells so good!</li>
    <li> This was such a great price. I thought it might be less sweet smelling than the original and it is. It is a good smell but slightly more perfume like than fruity.</li>
    <li> I will buy this product again I really enjoy using it smells and feels great on my skin and face</li>
    <li> This cream is the best I have found.  It has a subtle fragrance and absorbs quickly. It is  grease free.</li>
    <li> My favorite from this line of moisturizers. I wear it it instead of perfume sometimes</li>
    <li> It smells delicious and leaves my skin healthy and vibrant!</li>
    <li> Good quality moisturizer. A nice change from the citrus.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this would smell a little more like vanilla but it does not. It seems to work pretty well though, I just don&#x27;t care for the smell all that much.</li>
    <li> I really like Hempz, but this particular scent (Vanilla Plum) is a little to floral, and reminds me slightly of an older woman&#x27;s scent. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this particular scent again.</li>
    <li> Amazing smelling natural body moisturizer! Really works well! Would definitely buy this product again for myself and others! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I thought this lotion would be white, but its actually a light purple, not that it really matters. I love how it smells. Its very warm and cozy rather than sweet, which I love. I almost bought VS Pink lotion called warm and cozy on Amazon and I am glad I didn&#x27;t because that cost 2x more than this Hempz lotion and they almost smell the same! When I smelled Hempz Vanilla Plum it immediately reminded me of Warm &amp; Cozy by VS Pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with my purchase. The right price for the size and quality of this lotion. I do wish it would have less of a plum smell. There is a plum after smell (after that first whip of good vanilla smell). Also, it is kind of a thin formula that is slippery. But its not bad. I think I have found my staple lotion!</li>
    <li> As advertised...great purchase</li>
    <li> Best lotion I&#x27;ve found for a nurse&#x27;s hands. Non-greasy, soft and silky.</li>
    <li> Best moisturizing lotion out there. My skin loves it and cannot get enough of it. Buy it here so you don&#x27;t pay an arm and a leg for it in the salon! The scent Vanilla Plum is light enough to not cause a fuss in the office, at the same time of enticing the sense of smell.. its a fan favorite of everyone who experiences Vanilla Plum.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with this product.  I love the Hempz line of lotion and was very excited to find it for under $11, but once I received it I now know why.  It is much much thinner than the Hempz lotion my husband purchased from the spa.  I thought that maybe it was just the different scent because I have the Pomegranate and loved it!  I purchased some of the vanilla plum from the spa for $29...eeekkkk...but so worth it because it is thick like my pomegranate Hempz lotion .  Very disappointed  Amazon that your lotion is not the same quality and sane on you for selling it and leading us to believe that it would be.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend got this for me. It smells amazing! Its light enough to be used on my face and I have oily skin. I like that it isnt heavy or sticky, and it soaks in fast, yet still hydrates skin. My skin is soft and smells wonderful. Very happy.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, and this moisturizer doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like some brands do. I like the citrus blossom scent better than this one, but the vanilla plum is still pleasant. The scent is not over-powering and the moisturizing lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I like the O.G best. It smells pleasant, not over powering. BUT, I suppose I should leave well enough alone and stick with the tried and true. Original is better in my opinion- both fragrance wise and scent wise.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion smells good and is reasonable on Amazon.....</li>
    <li> I love the smell and the feel of it. The only down side is its hard to get all of it out once it gets low and I like to use every drop of it, That&#x27;s my only &amp;#34;&amp;#34;&#x27;complaint&amp;#34;&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I really like the lotion but I was not completely satisfied because it did not moisturize my skin well. The smell of the lotion was very extraordinary.</li>
    <li> I ordered Vanilla and received Plum vanilla ? Can&#x27;t do the smell its just to strong. I do like the moisturizer but not the scent .</li>
    <li> This seems to be a lighter than the original Hempz lotion, which I have used for many years. To be honest, I ordered this variety by mistake but I really like it. The scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming. Great product!</li>
    <li> Pleasant scent and wonderful price!!  Can&#x27;t beat it.  I love wearing this instead of perfume.</li>
    <li> The goods arrived as promised. However, somehow the cap came loose and lotion was every where when I received it.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this stuff. Use it as a body aroma in lieu of perfume. Lots of complements - thanks!</li>
    <li> Hempz is BY FAR my favorite moisturizer I have used in a long time... It&#x27;s such a decent price for the bottle. The Vanilla Plum is my favorite and the only scent I will use... This is my second bottle I&#x27;ve purchased and will continue to purchase it!!!</li>
    <li> We used to have to purchase this at a specialty beauty supply store.  I&#x27;m happy to have located it here on Amazon for half of what we normally spend.  This lotion is not too heavy, not too greasy and a little goes a long way.  The scent is mild.</li>
    <li> I like the cucumber better but this has more of a powdery smell and must be in the mood for it.  More on the perfume side rather than a natural scent but these lotions really are great.</li>
    <li> I wash my hands a lot and had very dry and cracked and bleeding hands before I started to use this product. Within 24 hours the cracks were healed and my hands were much smoother... been using it for months now and my hands are in great shape. Would recommend to anyone. Oh and the smell is great!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. its at least as great as the citrus one but smells a little better. I love all the hempz stuff; any of their lotion i&#x27;ve tried has been the least greasy of any lotion i&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Love the smell. Works great for keeping your skin moisturizer. Would recommend it o my friends. Plan to order more soon.</li>
    <li> Mu niece loves Hempz lotion.  It is hard to find in the stores in my area.  This is the fragrance she had on her wish list.  She loves this brand of lotion.</li>
    <li> Came super quickly. Was sealed when arrived. Smells identical to the bottles sold at my tanning salon since they recommend hempz lotion. Thinking I may be allergic though to it... Started sneezing like crazy last night after putting it on.</li>
    <li> Smells AMAZING! Love the feel of it!! Super Smart Buy!! :)</li>
    <li> Love this lotion..  And I am very picky when it comes to lotion.. Leaves skin feeling soft..  Love love love</li>
    <li> moisturizing without being sticky, the scent is light and fresh.  Aslo love the pump bottle, I have one on my desk and one on my nightstand - very convenient.  I will definitely order again!</li>
    <li> This has a lovely, but mild scent.  And it is a great lotion as well - absorbs fast, light and my skin feels great.</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful product!!!!!!!!!! Clean and refreshing - makes my skin feel so nice.&lt;br /&gt;Hope Hempz doesn&#x27;t drop this product in favor of their new product line.</li>
    <li> Love this product.. It smells so nice and it makes your skin so soft and stays hydrated all day.. Will recommend this product to all my friends.. I will defiantly buy more..</li>
    <li> I do like this lotion a lot. The first time I bought it was at a tanning salon a few years ago. The lotion smells amazing and it is so soft and makes my skin feel amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downfall is that it can be a little pricey.</li>
    <li> I like all of Hempz lotions and body butters but the smell of this is excellent. It is not overpowering and the scent of coconut is not obvious but pleasant. The moisturizer is like all Hempz lotions, that is, perfect at a good price.</li>
    <li> When I received the bottle of lotion, the box was not taped up or secured in any way. Literally half of the lotion was gone. Lotion was all over the bottle. The pump was completely broken, so I had to replace with my own. Very, very poor condition! I am not a very happy customer, so therefore, I will probably never purchase from here again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have a good day!!</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and works great to moisturize!  I have not noticed any difference in the quality buying on Amazon verses in another store that has a huge mark up for the same product! Thanks to Amazon for the great buy!</li>
    <li> This lotion is by far my favorite moisturizer! It smells so good even if you apply it after tanning and don&#x27;t shower, it helps to freshen you up for a couple hours so you don&#x27;t have to jump in the shower right away. I bought this item for $15 on Amazon last week which I thought was a good deal because my tanning salon sells it for $22, now it&#x27;s $9 on Amazon?? I gotta buy another before they raise the price again.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product and the delivery. They always let me know what was going on with my package in the tracking info. This lotion smells so good and my best friend is going to love it for her birthday!!!! I&#x27;m very excited and I could of given it to her for Christmas since it arrived a day before the estimated delivery date. I could not be happier!</li>
    <li> I have dry,blotchy,weird skin and this product helps with all that!  I plan on using it year round. My skin appears to be softer. The light scent of Hempz Vanilla Plum Herbal Body Moisturizer is very pleasant and not overwhelming at all.</li>
    <li> I really do love this lotion.  It is the best on the market today.  The vanilla plum is a nice mild scent.  I have all the others as well, but I go to this one the most.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time and was exactly what I expected. Was just as described... new, packaged properly and sealed. Enjoyed the lotion.</li>
    <li> The BEST BEST moisturizer I ever used! I could not have asked for better. I will definitely buy again :)</li>
    <li> This lotion was newly introduced to me and is a great product I will continue to purchase.  I recommend it!</li>
    <li> Just like the Pomegranate I have tried - this is great. Thinner than the pomegranate. This is more moisturizing. I ADORE the scent.</li>
    <li> I love this cream. It smells fantastic and keeps body moisturized after tanning. It is the best cream I have tried so far.</li>
    <li> My favorite lotion of all times, I&#x27;ve bought this at a salon before fore 3 times the price. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I have really dry hands from washing them and whatever. This is a lotion that I can wear as a guy and not get all self conscious about wearing something scented. It smells like cereal. How incredible is that?</li>
    <li> This is an awesome lotion.  Smells great and leaves your skin soft and moist.  I would highly recommend this lotion to anyone with dry skin.</li>
    <li> It smells great as well as it is a great moisturizer for your hands and body. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. It smells wonderful, it feels divine, and it&#x27;s natural so I feel good about putting it on my body. Trust this dirty hippie - it&#x27;s the bee&#x27;s knees.</li>
    <li> softens skin very well and smells amazing</li>
    <li> Love the scent and it makes my skin so soft!</li>
    <li> Absorbs quickly and makes your skin soft, but the best part was the price. It is over $20 in ulta and here I payed about $12.</li>
    <li> Love this Moisturizer!</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this lotion. And the texture and feel of it is SOO nice! Doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this lotion!! It is my new favorite. The smell is light and heavenly, not too greasy, absorbs quickly, and hydrates my skin.</li>
    <li> Love these products. Leave your skin smooth and smell amazing.</li>
    <li> This smells like yogurt to me. It&#x27;s actually rather refreshing. It smells great but isn&#x27;t overbearing. It also works exceptionally well. Which, given the price, it better. It spreads further than the average lotion as well. While I was skeptical at first, it is definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> Great brand and smells great and rich on your skin!  Love this product and what I see on my skin!</li>
    <li> It smells absolutley amazing, it is their best scent yet. It does keep my skin moisturized but not to the extent I was hoping. I got burnt after sanning and used it twice a day but I still peeled... a lot.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this lotion! I love the feeling of it! Amazing!!</li>
    <li> Love the Vanilla Plum fragrance.  Very nice smell and feels wonderful on the skin!  Will  definately order this item again!</li>
    <li> Best lotion on the market!</li>
    <li> Although I love the original scent, this is very nice also. Feels great, doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feeling on my skin &amp; doesn&#x27;t itch. Will be ordering more!!</li>
    <li> I simply love this lotion. It soaks into your skin without the greasy feel . It has a nice light fragrance. It makes your skin smooth and silky. The prices sure beats retail.</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff. Smells great! Price is on point!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife for tanning.  She uses before and after - lotion is thick and goes on good. Nice fragrance - but for a woman.</li>
    <li> This lotion is awesome. It goes on and then dries so that it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residual. Love it. Also great quick shipping from this company.</li>
    <li> I use this lotion all the time and its one of the few lotions that make my skin feel soft. Not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> i used this the first week and my skin felt a lot softer and smooth than before.  that surprised me because i already have naturally smooth skin.  i listen to the joe rogan podcast and watch vice and seen all the good benefits hemp has or can have for the body.  i am happy i made this decision to buy hempz.  the smell is better than i thought it would be.  i use cologne so the vanilla plum is a nice mixture because it doesn&#x27;t interfere with it.  nice light lotion and doesn&#x27;t give you that hella thick feel that nivea does (older one anyway)  i see myself checking out more of what they have to offer</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, it&#x27;s not like bath and body works where you put it on and then an hour later hop in the pool only to become a slimy mess. My skin absorbs the lotion and becomes very soft. The smell is good and also faint. I will be buying this again because it&#x27;s the first lotion I&#x27;ve ever completely gone through.</li>
    <li> love it. smells good got here super quick</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite lotions. The scent is amazing, but the feel is even better. It absorbs well, and keeps my skin feeling so smooth</li>
    <li> This is a nice moisturizer for my dry skin. My hands get really dry in winter and this works great. Some lotions I&#x27;ve used I can&#x27;t stand the smell of them, but this one isn&#x27;t too strong and doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
    <li> I was not sure if I would like the smell or not! I love it! Hempz is great period! Glad I have to buy it from now!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t even describe how many lotions I have tried, but this one is amazing! I love how light it goes on and still is packed with moisture. If you live in a humid climate like I do, this will be your new best friend. If you have not tried Hempz body butter, that is amazing to put on at night.</li>
    <li> I love all of the Hempz products I&#x27;ve used and this is the same.  The fragrance is light and pleasant and the moisturizer lasts a long time. The price was excellent, much less than other discount stores.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells amazing! I wear it every morning and just love how it leaves your skin so soft!</li>
    <li> I love all the lotions from this company, and even though it sounds gay, yes I have all three smelling lotions in my bathroom and alternate them. My girlfriend also digs them.</li>
    <li> My daughter had it at her house when I visited.  I loved the way my hands felt after using it for a week.  Ordered as soon as I got home.</li>
    <li> Lotion itself is good texture, feels great on skin, absorbs well. I was hoping for more of a fragrance, either plummy or vanilla-y, but it&#x27;s so faint you can&#x27;t even tell you&#x27;re wearing anything. This might be perfect if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, but the original version has such a strong, pleasant, lingering scent, I was expecting more of the same, just in a different scent.</li>
    <li> This lotion is the best lotion I have come across. The Vanilla Plum smells amazing. It&#x27;s not too strong. It has a soft smell to it, almost like a powder. The lotion leaves your skin super soft and gives a clean feeling. My boyfriend absolutely loves the smell and the feel of it. It also doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, it rubs into the skin easily and keeps your skin moisturized for awhile.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve bought this before but not on amazon. Smells and feels great on my skin. Shipping caused the bottle to leak. very messy when I received it.</li>
    <li> My sister likes to use this and say it smells good. She says it makes her hands soft after she has been cleaning</li>
    <li> gave as a gift she loved it and bought more!!  Great PRICE!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion and love the smell!</li>
    <li> I originally got this lotion as a sample from a salon and really liked it! It smells great but not over powering, the lotion really does moisturize the skin as well and leaves my legs smooth for 2-3 days after one application. I ended up buying it on amazon due to not being able to find it in a store near where I live so not sure if the price is much different or not but I definitely think the price was worth it since it is a pretty big bottle compared to other lotions you get at say, bath and body works.</li>
    <li> this lotion works well and smells great! Ive been using it for a long time in the regular scent. I love this one stays nice and moistured on skin....</li>
    <li> I LOVE this lotion!!! It doesn&#x27;t leave that greasy feeling behind on your skin. It smells wonderful , too. You can feel it soothe your dry skin quickly and leaves your skin baby soft. Who doesn&#x27;t want that?</li>
    <li> Really like this lotion. Buy it here because it is half of what you would pay at Ulta or a tanning salon!!</li>
    <li> I love most Hempz lotions.  The formula is great.  And I love the scent of plum.  The scent of this horrid.  Plasticky fake vanilla and some sort of weird sweet fruitiness that has no relationship whatsoever with plum.  This smells like a Dollar Store copy of Jean Paul Gauthier Le Male.  Just teeth grindingly awful.</li>
    <li> Excellent lotion lifetime customer.</li>
    <li> Love Hempz but gave my husband this bottle as the scent was a little too much. I prefer the original.</li>
    <li> Smells great and light enough to not be greasy. Works great for massage because it&#x27;s not sticky or thick. Highly Recommended.</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness this is the best Moisturizer ever. I wash my hands and leave a bit of water add lotion and work into my skin is so velvety soft. Such a gorgeous sent very happy with and will buy again. Only need small amount...Smiles. I&#x27;m so excited to have it to use. Amazing Product. Improved the smoothness of my skin with in first few times of using it.</li>
    <li> Terrific scent and consistency.  I would purchase this again.</li>
    <li> My ultimate favorite Hempz lotion, I love the smell.</li>
    <li> love, love love this product. recieved in a timely fashion. The lotion  doesnt feel greasy and soaks right in for a all day wear. pleaseing smell. Not to strong. would get again for sure.</li>
    <li> Love this product but can only use it at home. I work in a perfume-free scent-free office so can&#x27;t use it at work, but I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I received a used product.&lt;br /&gt;I order the triple whipped HHempz 4 at a time so I know how this product is delivered.&lt;br /&gt;Was originally told there were none in Stock but received this 3 days later. Half bottle and dripping. Also NOTHING like the triple whipped blue.&lt;br /&gt;Too much trouble to return, stuck with used product I will not use.</li>
    <li> best stuff ever for dry skin</li>
    <li> I have a hard time finding this locally...It smells so great!</li>
    <li> This lotion does exactly what it claims and unlike one review that said it does not cure or moisturize dry skin I completely disagree.  I used this last night after just receiving it.  I applied it twice to very dry hands and today there is huge difference.  My experience with this product is a very positive one.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and how it hydrates my skin</li>
    <li> glad hempz came out with these new scents, love em!</li>
    <li> Really great for after tanning. Doesn&#x27;t clog pores and isn&#x27;t oily. Smell is nice and the bottle is big!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!</li>
    <li> Smells and feels really nice on the skin. I would purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I love Hempz lotion and this is by far my favorite scent. The only negative comment I have is that there was a little lotion that seemed to have exploded out of the top during shipping, but it wasn&#x27;t significant.</li>
    <li> Mmmm, love this lotion. Smells great and moisturizes well.</li>
    <li> best moisturizer i have come across and i have used many. i have a dermatitis and this is the only thing i can use with out aggravating my skin.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing. This is a heavier lotion I wouldn&#x27;t want to use on my face. But excellent body/hand lotion.</li>
    <li> Best lotion! Love it!</li>
    <li> really love this lotion</li>
    <li> This smells so good! I really like it. It absorbs quickly into my skin and keeps it very soft. This may be my new go-to lotion!</li>
    <li> I really love the original Hempz lotion, so I decided to try this Vanilla Plum scent. Fell in love with it!!! It smells really really good and has the wonderful moisturizing qualities of their original lotion!</li>
    <li> I LOVE Their lotions! It works wonders on my dry skin living in the Southwest. The scent of Vanilla and Plum is not overwhelming just a light fragrance. I have two other bottles of this lotion and love them all.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and keeps my hands smooth! Would recommend</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like the smell at all, had to exchange it for classic and pomegranate</li>
    <li> The product it&#x27;s self deserves five stars, I love the smell and brand. Very moisturizing and non greasy. My only reason behind giving it 4 stars was due to the packaging. The lotion was all over the place and quite messy.  Still had 3/4 of the product left in the bottle so I didn&#x27;t feel like I had a reason to fuss about it when it&#x27;s already such a good deal.</li>
    <li> Hempz makes excellent body lotions. I love the different varieties and price.  This is a thick lotion.  Lasting moisturization.  I highly reccommend this product!</li>
    <li> I payed like nine dollars for this, and it is the exact same thing as going to the store and paying the full twenty-five bucks. This lotion is so nice, it absorbs into my skin quickly and smells wonderful. I use it almost every time I get out of the shower and people always comment on how soft my skin is! I use this or the Victoria Secret PINK lotion, I love them both but I think I like this one a little bit better.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my gf and she loves it. She said she likes the way her skin feels and it smells very good.</li>
    <li> I usually can&#x27;t wear anything with a scent but the Hempz products don&#x27;t bother me. I normally use the original lotion but I like this one even better.</li>
    <li> love it I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT</li>
    <li> Love the scent, and the lotion is great!</li>
    <li> This is a nice lotion.  Moisturizing and not greasy.  I don&#x27;t like the fragrance, it isn&#x27;t over powering of anything.  It has a sort of super sweet fragrance like it would be good for a young girl.  Almost no detectable.vanilla fragrance, just synthetic plum.  Giving it to.my eleven year old, she loves it.</li>
    <li> I have always had dry skin. Since I have been using this , I have no dry skin. I highly recommend this product. It also smells great. I use it everyday. There sin&#x27;t anything I dislike about this product.</li>
    <li> I received this Hempz Vanilla Plum last summer as a  gift at a golf scramble.  I love the way it makes my skin feel, soft, not dry.  I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores but luckily I found it on Amazon.  I&#x27;ll continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, and it leaves the skin feeling extremely soft.  Really absorbs into the skin quickly and stays moisturized.  Favorite part is that it&#x27;s natural.</li>
    <li> I really like the way this smells- not too sweet, not too strong. It really kind of reminds me of Juicy perfume. It absorbs quickly and keeps my skin hydrated in Arizona- no small fete.</li>
    <li> I love it! Love the smells.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t stop to use it. Smell is amazing! Creme is gentle taking into the skin. Makes the skin soft and stays the light smell for a long time.</li>
    <li> Smells very nice and moisturizes your skin well.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves the lotion and has a great scent!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. Definitely a good buy!</li>
    <li> This lotion feels soooo good, and LOVE the vanilla plum scent!  It soaks in, doesn&#x27;t just stay on top of your skin.  One of my all-time favorites, and I am in my late 50s.</li>
    <li> feels and smells great...</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the smell of this lotion and it works great as a mosturizer as well! No complaints here!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! It works so nicely and you don&#x27;t have to use it right after tanning necessarily. :) will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I just LOVE Hempz products, but I just can&#x27;t pay the price! The scents are yummy but not too over-powering and I like the consistency, but in the store this stuff is expensive! It is definitely worth it for this price!</li>
    <li> I love this brand of lotion.  Your skin will drink in this lotion without a greasy feel and it lasts all day.  This lotion has a light fruity/floral scent.  The ability to find the Hempz at this price was amazing!</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and is very moisturizing!! I am addicted!!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion leaves your body nice and soft.</li>
    <li> Love the scent!! Hempz always makes great products.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! It smells absolutely amazing and not too strong. I&#x27;m always getting compliments on how good I smell on the lake.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s birthday.  She always uses it but could only afford the little bottle.  Thanks to Amazon, I was able to get the big bottle and the price was great!</li>
    <li> This is a very hydrating lotion with a wonderful fragrance! It doesn&#x27;t leave any residue around my nails as some lotions do and it is not \\&quot;greasy.\\&quot; I am very satisfied with this product. I bought this at the beauty supply for $21.98 with 20% off - but Amazon has it for even less!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful hand and body lotion!  It does a great job moisturizing, and the fragrance is delightful!  Will definitely purchase this one again.</li>
    <li> I love Hempz Original and use it regularly.  I&#x27;ve enjoyed using Hempz Citrus Blossom.  Both are scented lightly and pleasantly and both moisturize wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being happy with these 2 Hempz products (as well as the Hempz face wash), I decided to &amp;#34;buy before I try&amp;#34;, the Hempz Vanilla Plum.  When I received the bottle I promptly put a little dab on my arm.  I knew immediately that it is scented stronger than I like, but thought I would try to &amp;#34;wait it out&amp;#34; for the scent to calm.  After 20 minutes I HAD to wash my arm.  The scent is too much for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s the problem with &amp;#34;buy before I try&amp;#34;.  Now I have a full bottle of lotion that I&#x27;m stuck with because it&#x27;s not cost effective to send it back.  On the up-side, I already have a nice gift for someone!</li>
    <li> Love the lotion would recommend this product. The bottle broke inside the package and lotion was all over. Better packaging is needed!</li>
    <li> Smells really good. Better than the other Hempz lotions that I bought earlier.</li>
    <li> Love it I bought mine at ulta and love it</li>
    <li> love this lotion it quenches your skin and leaves it very soft with a light scent , you can&#x27;t go wrong with any of the blends</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lotion, and I bought it through Amazon for a lot less than the store cost.  Everyone compliments me on the fragrance, and my hands love how soft they feel.</li>
    <li> lotion was also not sealed and was all over I threw this away also waste of money</li>
    <li> Hempz really doesnt make a bad product. This lotion seemed to be thinner than the pomegranite, my favorite, it went further and i enjoyed the vanilla plum scent.........however my wife did not. She is ULTRA scent sensitive, this scent didnt sit well with her, too perfumy. I still liked it. Thinner and more aroma, if you can live with that, buy it, dry skin wont stand a chance!</li>
    <li> liked the smell liked it better than the citrus keeps my skin moist to help keep my tan i use it right after i get out of the tanner.</li>
    <li> Love that it&#x27;s natural and love the way it makes my skin feel.  It is very creamy yet absorbs quickly. It smells fantastic!  I cannot say enough good things about it. It leaves my skin feeling silky smooth and I have dry skin to start out with.  I would typically get this at my hair salon but Amazon has it priced a lot better :)  Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Smells wonderfully and the scent lasts on your skin for hours! Combats dry skin from winter and tanning leaving my skin feeling baby soft.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I know a lot of people use this for after tanning, but I do not tan and just love this lotion.  It smells wonderful and leaves you feeling silky smooth.  Not greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> Hemp &amp; have never seen this fragrence so I had to order it. I also loved the price.It is half of what the price is at all other stores.I love My Amazon</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find a better lotion. I have troubles with Celiac Disease and delighted with this gentle and soft fragranced moisturizer!</li>
    <li> I use this lotion daily! The vanilla plum smell is wonderful and the lotion is an excellent value. Leaves my skin feeling soft and fresh every time. I will definitely look to keep buying this product in the future!</li>
    <li> When my friend let me use her bottle, I instantly fell in love with the smell ! It moisturizes so well too. The scent and moisture are long lasting ! I use this product daily. LOVE IT !</li>
    <li> I had a friend recommend this product so my hopes were high, but it seems overpriced for just another lotion.  I prefer lubriderm</li>
    <li> This lotion smells so good! Non-greasy yet super creamy formula. Doesn&#x27;t last all day so I put on at morning and night. Despite it only lasting for 8 hours or so it&#x27;s still my favorite lotion because of the smell and feel of my skin right after I apply.</li>
    <li> This smells amazing and works really great. It is natural and simply the best lotion out there.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. My skin gets very dry in the winter and this stuff solves it In a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> Nice lotion, leaves skin soft. Scent isn&#x27;t the greatest.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion scent the most out of all the Hemps Lotions!! Perfect for freshly shaved legs!</li>
    <li> Great long lasting moisture and a lovely scent. The order arrived on time as promised.</li>
    <li> The scent is very strong. Too strong for me, it made me a bit nauseas. It&#x27;s not a bad smell, but you can tell it is a perfume one and not a natural scent. Also, and this is my own fault (and because it was my own fault, it didn&#x27;t factor into my rating), it is tinted purple. If you are looking for a natural lotion, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> Yummy smell. It goes on silky smooth and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky at all. It keeps my dry skin moisturized all day.</li>
    <li> the best and good price , smells fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;its my favorite lotion and it lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;get it!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with purchase. Hempz vanilla plum is my absolute favorite out of all the other scents...makes my skin feel so soft</li>
    <li> I was excited to find Hempz on Amazon as I&#x27;ve been a Hempz user for many years.  When I received the lotion, I immediately noticed that the lotion is not like the Hempz I&#x27;ve been using for years.  At first I thought that the company may have changed the formula so I decided to contact Hempz customer service directly to inquire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Hempz customer service representative said that they&#x27;ve received many calls from Amazon buyers asking if they&#x27;ve changed their product.  They have not.  She said that she could provide me with a list of authorized retailers so I can check if I purchased from one.  The name of the company I purchased this from (through Amazon) was not listed.  I immediately drove to Ulta (an authorized retailer) to buy a bottle of the same lotion because I wanted to compare the two side by side.  The lotion I purchased from the Amazon website is definitely not the same as the stuff I bought at Ulta.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price of the original Hempz is pretty steep in my opinion at about $22-$25 for a 17oz bottle.  I was excited to find it on Amazon for half the price, but sadly if it seems too good to be true, it probably is.  I returned the bottle I purchased from Amazon and will continue to be a loyal Hempz customer simply because it&#x27;s the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used (even at the steep price).</li>
    <li> I LOVE Hempz lotion.  A co worker at one of my previous employers introduced me to it and I fell in love.  For some reason though, this Vanilla Plum version does not seem to moisturize quite as well, but it still does a really good job and smells amazing.  I would purchase this again and I recommend it to people all the time.</li>
    <li> The Hempz lotion is great stuff, I just wish there was a version that was not so darn fragrant!  The scents are just way too overpowering, and everywhere you go, everyone else is hit with the scent as well.  If you are looking to cover up some of the worst BO, this is the stuff will do it and then some.  Remove the strong scent and make a guy scent, and I will order a bunch along with 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance and how it drinks into my skin. It&#x27;s silky and luxurious. It is much cheaper here than buying it at a tanning salon</li>
    <li> Have always loved Hempz, but having a different scent is nice.  As always it heals the worst skin; even that that&#x27;s been in CA for months without lotion, my hands were a train wreck, but Hempz has started its  miracle of healing. The pain is almost gone, and my skin looks like skin again instead of poorly tanned leather!!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I love this! The vanilla plum is the best smelling stuff, I wish they made more products with this sent.  I got the scrub as well, YUM</li>
    <li> Nice size for the price.  It is not greasy and I love the smell. It is not too over powering smell either.</li>
    <li> I purchased eight bottles after my wife raved about it. I love the light scent and the lotion is second to none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#60;Todd &amp;#62;</li>
    <li> What a great deal and great product! I buy hempz all the time and i will never pay full price again!</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer and smells so good.  Gave as Christmas presents all the ladies loved it.</li>
    <li> this product has helped soften my dry skin. I put it on at night and let it work it&#x27;s magic. Also I have nerve pain in my hands and it helps relieve it. I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> love this lotion! smells good</li>
    <li> I do like it. However, I am partial the the original and pomegranate. I probably will not order it again, because I like the other scents more.</li>
    <li> Smells great, keeps my skin moisturized for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Con: doesn&#x27;t give foot massage.</li>
    <li> This lotion absorbs quickly and smells really nice without being over powering.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion..it has helped my dry skin tons. My skin feels and looks so much healthier since I&#x27;ve been using it. Plan to try other products in the Hempz line.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item because of reviews saying how great it smelled. I rec&#x27;d mine yesterday and it has absolutely NO smell at all. Was it old??? I emailed the seller but no response. very unhappy with this one. Someone gave me a bottle of this with another fragrance and it smells great and lasts along time but this one which is suppose to be Vanilla Plum has no smell at all. Very unhappy.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and is not greasy. I have abandoned all my other lotions for this one. This is my favorite Hempz  fragrance.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good body moisterizer without parabens, etc. I first tried this product. I liked the scent and it was overall great so I looked into the gallon versions on Amazon and found that it is a great money saver. The only problem with the gallon is that it&#x27;s huge but you can put it under the sink and fill up this smaller bottle if you prefer.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Love this product!</li>
    <li> nice and smooth skin after one use! I totally recommend this lotion. I will be using it for tanning beds</li>
    <li> Received in good condition and quickly.  I&#x27;ve always loved this lotion.  It&#x27;s nice and thick, wonderful fragrance.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Hempz Vanilla Plum Herbal Body Moisturizer works so well &amp; smells amazing!</li>
    <li> Love this hempz moisturizer! I work with my hands a lot and this moisturizer has helped keep my hands and body nice and soft. Love the smell too! Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I began using Hempz products back in my tanning bed days and have always enjoyed their products. Leaves your skin smooth and it smells great!</li>
    <li> When I opened the envelope this lotion came in, the pump was broken off and lotion was everywhere.  I was really excited about this lotion.  Very Disappointed!</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and my skin stays moistured all day!</li>
    <li> I received the lotion a lot quicker than it said I would; the estimated shipment date wasn&#x27;t until 12/23-01/03. It smells wonderful and I love this lotion. I used to use the original scented one but when I saw this one, I decided to try it because I really enjoyed the scent of the original one so I figured this one had to smell even better, and sure enough it did! I have used Hempz lotion for years now and I always put it on before bed and during the day; I love how soft it makes my hands. Definitely worth the money, and it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> This product is the only smelly thing I can tolerate its mild and smells so good. The lotion is great too. A must for your skin to feel pampered and keep healthy.</li>
    <li> This has a nice smell but it does not linger too long to mix with your perfume.  My husband even likes it so that says a lot to me.  The price was not bad but it is not a cheap lotion.  I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> received the product quickly but 1/3rd of the moisturizer had leaked out into package. In addition to this the scent of this is not as pleasant as the original formula and would prefer that over the scented.</li>
    <li> This scent of Hempz is my new favorite. My husband is very particular about the smell of lotions I use. I&#x27;m so happy that he also likes the smell of this lotion when I use it and I love the hempz lotion line in general. The only cons I&#x27;ve noticed is the consistency of this bottle compared to those I&#x27;ve previously bought in the salon is a little thinner than I&#x27;d like. The bottle also was not packaged/secured very well, so when I received it there was lotion all over the bottle and in the loose baggie it came in. Bottles I&#x27;ve bought from other sellers had a type of shrink wrap around the bottle to stop that from happening.</li>
    <li> I love Hempz - won&#x27;t use any other body moisturizer - great price and great quality product.  I highly recommend their products.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite lotions! Great moisture, smells amazing, keeps skin silky smooth!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only lotion I buy anymore!</li>
    <li> I would not purchase this as it does not moisturize.  I had to add coconut oil to the mixture..</li>
    <li> I do enjoy the original scent more than anything, but this was a nice change of pace. I am only giving 4 stars to make it clear that the original is worth all 5!</li>
    <li> A friend of mine gave this to me for my birthday and I loved it! When it was used up I found it on Amazon and ordered another for myself. The Vanilla Plum has a light scent so it&#x27;s not overwhelming. It makes a great birthday gift!</li>
    <li> Smells great but it when it arrived a small amount of lotion had dripped out and into the plastic bag it came in. For the price I think this product is definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> I love the lotion. It absorbs quickly but stays with you.  I&#x27;ve used the vanilla plum, pommegranite, malibu, and the original scent. The vanilla plum is now my favorite by far. It&#x27;s a rich but delicate scent.</li>
    <li> The smell is a bit strong for me but overall great product i deff does the job its supposed too</li>
    <li> Excellent product with a nice light fragrance.  This lotion goes on smooth and absorbs quickly without feeling sticky or greasy.</li>
    <li> I like the smell of this one he best! The vanilla plum I think smells better than the pomegranate.</li>
    <li> The lotion is so soft and gentle.  Smells good too.  My nail thec turn me on to it.  I love it.</li>
    <li> left my skin feeling very soft and moursurized, I&#x27;m in the sun alot so I applied morining and night. I could tell a difference in my skin after only 2 days of use.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and lasts a long time. Moisturizes and smells great.</li>
    <li> Since I live in the desert, I want a lotion that is really effective, as well as one with a pleasant scent.  This lotion works for me on both counts.  Definitely would order this one again, as it meets my needs very nicely.</li>

    <li> BOUGHT AS A GIFT FOR MY GRANDAUGHTER - SHE LOVES IT  WANNA TRY IT FOR OURSELVES  SMELLS GREAT - ALSO VERY CREAMY FOR THE SKIN</li>
    <li> While I prefer some of the other fragrances, this has a delicate smell.  Is hydrating to skin, so I&#x27;d purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer. I use it instead of shaving lotion and like it much, much better.</li>
    <li> I have always been a fan of Hempz lotions! Very good for moisturizing and the scent it very nice and subtle! Not greasy at all!</li>
    <li> I love the smell.So does my husband.I wish it was a little thicker but that wouldnt stop me from ordering it again.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know that Hempz makes body lotion in any other fragrance than their traditional &amp;#34;Herbal Moisturizer&amp;#34;.  You can imagine my delight to see that there are other super fragrant options with aromas like Pomegranate, Vanilla Plum, Citrus Blossom with the same all-day moisturizing succulence that makes this lotion addictive.  My only wish is that they would expand the fragrances for their body washes.</li>
    <li> Hempz makes the best moisturizers. It is moisturizing without leaving a greasy film. It leaves skin soft and smelling wonderful. The scent is not overpowering at all, it is soft and wonderful!  I love it.</li>
