      <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
      <li>The &#x27;snap&#x27; magnet that the recharge cord has is fantastic.     </li>
      <li>So far so good.  </li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m assuming it is indeed cleaning my face better and more gently than using just my hands or a cloth of some type.  </li>
      <li>My skin feels rejuvenated and clean.  </li>
      <li>Cannot confirm if it&#x27;s a direct result of using this brush though since I try many things including supplements and eating healthy.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m rough on my belongings, but this one still works and looks as great as the day I got it.    </li>
      <li>My skin tone has improved and my skin is much more smooth, even and soft than it was before using the Clarisonic.</li>
      <li>The Clarisonic Mia retains it&#x27;s charge very well, and it leaves my face feeling smooth and clean.  </li>
      <li>I am enjoying my new mia day after day.</li>
      <li>I was very hesitant at first to try it since it&#x27;s a bit costly, but I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
      <li>My skin feels so good after using it and it is so relaxing to use after a rough shift at work.  </li>
      <li>It is worth every penny.</li>
      <li>and I think the product is worth having it.</li>
      <li>but VERY glad I bought the Mia and not the larger one because I can&#x27;t imagine needing more settings and a larger head.</li>
      <li>I use it twice a day and notice right away when I skip a use.</li>
      <li>but for now it&#x27;s a nice way to clean my face and not feel that I wasted $150.  </li>
      <li>I have noticed my skin glows more recently.  </li>
      <li>I would guess my first charge lasted about a month.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my first time using anything like this, and I like the way my face feels afterwards.  </li>
      <li>but my skin feels smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>You want to make sure you use moisturizer after washing your face with the clarisonic because your skin will feel tight and squeaky clean.</li>
      <li>It buffs off dead skin and helps clean my face better than using just my scrub.</li>
      <li>Mine holds a charge for a few weeks without having to be recharged, so it&#x27;s a perfect for travel (with a little pre-charging before you depart, of course).</li>
      <li>b/c I don&#x27;t need to use as much any longer with this tool.  </li>
      <li>So much so that I&#x27;ve bought 5 others as gifts (they go nicer, newer versions).</li>
      <li>I honestly would go with the pricecut on the mia, as opposed to the larger standard clarisonic.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It holds a charge for a long time and is easy to keep and use in</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s only has one setting, but that&#x27;s really all you need for really clean skin.</li>
      <li>I use it once or twice a week now, with a very mind soft cleanser.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s a small indicator light that flashes different colors to tell you where you stand with battery life on the back-it&#x27;s fairly easy to see.     </li>
      <li>I have still gotten new acne</li>
      <li>As with most rechargeable, there&#x27;s usually a socket for the plug to connect to.</li>
      <li>but I think 1 min is good enough to remove dirt efficiently without irritating your face, although the brush is gentle enough.</li>
      <li>At first it felt a bit harsh on my skin, but I got used to it really fast.  </li>
      <li>I bought it thinking I was saving about 30 bucks than buying it from the official website, but at the end not sure if that was a smart buy since clarisonic.com offers an extra full size moisturizer, a spare brush + carrying tote.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s smaller than I expected when I got it, but it&#x27;s fairly useful.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried 3-4 different brands, from drug store to paying... entirely too much.</li>
      <li>She said you don&#x27;t really need the more expensive one.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t seen any major results yet</li>
      <li>Over time, those begin to break, warp, acquire gunk or just in general need to be replaced.</li>
      <li>I have had less breakouts and my skin is so much softer!  </li>
      <li>It is so convenient and easy to pack the small version-it takes up much less room in my suitcase.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great gift and product, bought in a fun color to match my moms bathroom decor. She tried cheaper brands, they don&#x27;t compare.</li>
    <li> I purchased this due to all the reviews and it will probably end up in a garage sale at some point but for now it&#x27;s a nice way to clean my face and not feel that I wasted $150.  I honestly do not see a difference. I have facials and microdermabrasion treatments done regularly and do see a difference when I keep those up but not from this. It&#x27;s the same concept as the electric toothbrush so I&#x27;m assuming it is indeed cleaning my face better and more gently than using just my hands or a cloth of some type.  When I realized that Olay has a $60 model I would have definitely opted for that since it appears to be the same concept.  Sorry, not impressed but VERY glad I bought the Mia and not the larger one because I can&#x27;t imagine needing more settings and a larger head.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It buffs off dead skin and helps clean my face better than using just my scrub. My face is clearer with fewer white heads and black heads! I use it twice a day and notice right away when I skip a use.</li>
    <li> I am in love with my clarisonic mia. It is an amazing product that fulfills all it says it will. I would recommend it to all skin types and ages. It has cleaned my skin more than I could ever do myself.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying my new mia day after day. I haven&#x27;t seen any major results yet but my skin feels smooth and soft. This tool makes removing makeup and washing your face a breeze. It turns off in 1 minute and you are done. You can continue if you want but I think 1 min is good enough to remove dirt efficiently without irritating your face, although the brush is gentle enough.You want to make sure you use moisturizer after washing your face with the clarisonic because your skin will feel tight and squeaky clean. The battery lasts at least 2 weeks using it once a day which is very convenient. I bought it thinking I was saving about 30 bucks than buying it from the official website, but at the end not sure if that was a smart buy since clarisonic.com offers an extra full size moisturizer, a spare brush + carrying tote. Anyways, I am still happy with my purchase and I think the product is worth having it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for three weeks.  Usually only once daily.  I have noticed my skin glows more recently.  Cannot confirm if it&#x27;s a direct result of using this brush though since I try many things including supplements and eating healthy.  I have still gotten new acne so it has not helped curb that yet.  But will continue daily use and hope for future results.</li>
    <li> I recently ordered this and I am loving it!  My skin feels rejuvenated and clean.  I was very hesitant at first to try it since it&#x27;s a bit costly, but I&#x27;m glad I did.  I use it twice a day (morning and night) along with the Clarisonic cleanser followed by eye cream and moisturizer and my skin feels great.  At first it felt a bit harsh on my skin, but I got used to it really fast.  Just make sure to follow the instructions and charge it for the full 24 hrs.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Battery seems to last a while on one charge.  I would guess my first charge lasted about a month.  Easy to use.  I think it will probably save money on cleansers b/c I don&#x27;t need to use as much any longer with this tool.  I wish the timing pulses were on this lower end model. 20 sec forehead and chin and 10 sec for cheeks for a total of a minute.  I got this model vs. the more expensive because of an aestheticians advice.  She said you don&#x27;t really need the more expensive one.  This one does the job just fine.  So far so good.  I&#x27;ve only used it a little over a month.  Love the color too.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying using this product. It&#x27;s my first time using anything like this, and I like the way my face feels afterwards.  I feel like I am beginning to see some improvement in overall texture and maybe even some softening of the few facial lines I have.  Time will only tell, but I&#x27;m hopeful! Great product!</li>
    <li> The Clarisonic Mia retains it&#x27;s charge very well, and it leaves my face feeling smooth and clean.  Great product if you&#x27;re looking for clean, clear skin.</li>
    <li> I use this daily and I just love it... I would recommend this product to my friends to use daily...</li>
    <li> I already had a full-sized Clarisonic cleaning system which I love when I decided to order this mini cleansing system expecially for traveling. It is so convenient and easy to pack the small version-it takes up much less room in my suitcase. I would not travel anywhere without my clarisonic brush and this Mia is just perfect for that purpose. I love it!!</li>
    <li> When I stumbled across this product while looking for exfoliating products I instantly knew I had to have one!  My skin feels so good after using it and it is so relaxing to use after a rough shift at work.  I have had less breakouts and my skin is so much softer!  I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for the perfect facial scrubber. Honestly, this is it. I&#x27;ve tried 3-4 different brands, from drug store to paying... entirely too much. This is obviously on the pricer side, but the previous ones I&#x27;ve had break down within a year or two. I&#x27;ve had this for a little over a year and a half now. I&#x27;m rough on my belongings, but this one still works and looks as great as the day I got it.    It&#x27;s smaller than I expected when I got it, but it&#x27;s fairly useful. I honestly would go with the pricecut on the mia, as opposed to the larger standard clarisonic. The only difference that I found between the two is the option for the body brush on the standard. Which could be nice, but this works perfectly fine-just takes a little time.    The cord is my favorite feature. As with most rechargeable, there&#x27;s usually a socket for the plug to connect to. Over time, those begin to break, warp, acquire gunk or just in general need to be replaced. The &#x27;snap&#x27; magnet that the recharge cord has is fantastic.     Mine holds a charge for a few weeks without having to be recharged, so it&#x27;s a perfect for travel (with a little pre-charging before you depart, of course). There&#x27;s a small indicator light that flashes different colors to tell you where you stand with battery life on the back-it&#x27;s fairly easy to see.     Small and compact, I barely notice it in my suitcase.    It&#x27;s easy to clean. I&#x27;ve tried a few different soaps with it, but that&#x27;s really up to the user&#x27;s preference I suppose. All you do is twist the brush off the head and rinse off the handle, then snap it back on. Really simple.     It just feels solidly built, with the extra finesse of some touches like the cord and cleanup. If I had to buy it over again, I would. But it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
    <li> My sister loves this machine I bought for her as a birthday present.  Am just happy that she actually uses it , and she is delighted the improvement of her skin</li>
    <li> love this gadget!  So much so that I&#x27;ve bought 5 others as gifts (they go nicer, newer versions).</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant to buy this as it is so expensive.But glad i did.It is worth every penny.I am using it for about a week now.My my husband says that my skin is glowing :).Highly recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> My wife likes it, it made her skin smooth&lt;br /&gt;She did breakout with initial use, still waiting for recovery but she does like the smoothness&lt;br /&gt;Seems overpriced, nice charger, held on magnetically&lt;br /&gt;Replacement heads work, when head wears out&lt;br /&gt;Overall good purchase</li>
    <li> The Clarisonic Mia is the perfect skin cleansing system.  It&#x27;s only has one setting, but that&#x27;s really all you need for really clean skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for one year and I still love it. I started out using it daily (after removing my make-up)  because I had some dry skin and flaking.

FYI)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Replacement brushes are now sold at Macy&#x27;s in the cosmetic department but I&#x27;m certain that they are less expensive here on Amazon.</li>
