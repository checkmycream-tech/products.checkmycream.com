### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Matched my skin perfectly</li>
      <li>Perfect for tossing in your purse for touch ups on the go!</li>

      <li>I just think you have to have great skin to see the benefits of it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving it the rating that I have because the product itself is great.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m always in search of a good powder foundation</li>
      <li>Product is good but sample size is pitiful.</li>
      <li>It has always been a challenge to find a foundation that provides good, even coverage and minimizes pores without feeling like it&#x27;s caked on.</li>
      <li>This one is probably going to be good for both.  </li>
      <li>My skin immediately looked softer and smoother and I was very happy with the light, yet thorough, coverage.</li>
      <li>I am still giving five stars even though it&#x27;s not for me because it is a good product.</li>

      <li>but this brand is exceptional.</li>
      <li>The best thing for me is that it keeps my oily skin at bay for several hours, and provides excellent coverage and minimizes the look of pores.</li>
      <li>and I imagine it would have worked great with a liquid foundation below for better coverage.</li>
      <li>I will be ordering more!</li>

      <li>I am very glad to have found this product for such a good deal, and fast shipping!</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth lightweight and I like the feel</li>
      <li>received a sample of bareMinerals in Fairly Light.</li>
      <li>The product itself is awesome and makes my skin long much younger and healthier that most products that I have tried!</li>
      <li>For significant blemishes, forget it.</li>
      <li>then I expected but all in all the product is great .</li>
      <li>Nice coverage , silky soft powder .</li>
      <li>For starters, while I knew that I was purchasing a sample size (I like to have samples to carry in my makeup bag rather than full size products)</li>
      <li>Gives full coverage.</li>
      <li>color was true to the description.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m hesitant to purchase a full size when I&#x27;m testing out makeup but</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ll differently buy more tall so amazing and don&#x27;t even get me started on the brush so soft:)</li>
      <li>In love this this I have super sensitive skin</li>
      <li>It is very light feeling, not heavy like some liquid foundations.</li>
      <li>So when I was offered this Bare Minerals Powder Foundation from Bare Escentuals for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion and thoughts about it, I definitely ordered it to try and see how the look compares to liquid foundation.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve seen many reviews that complain about the size of the product-in the description, it is clearly stated that it is a trial size.  </li>
      <li>It leaves your skin feeling so soft and smooth!</li>
      <li>I have had better coverage from other, more affordable brands.</li>
      <li>Samples that I have purchased from other name brands were perfect for my cosmetics bag for multiple uses on the go.</li>
      <li>I have always struggled with finding the right foundation.</li>
      <li>Just the right size for a weekend getaway.  </li>
      <li>This product is amazing, a little too light for my skin tone.</li>
      <li>This was a very tiny little set but the perfect tester for color matching.</li>
      <li>The color matched my skin pretty well</li>
      <li>I definitely recommend this Bare Minerals Powder Foundation from Bare Escentuals for anyone who wants a great light foundation.</li>
      <li>With all that being said, I tried it on my wrist first, it looked like foundation.</li>
      <li>I now know what high end means.!!</li>
      <li>I would consider trying a different shade to see if I get better results.</li>
      <li>I am fair but this shade left a yellow look to my skin.</li>
      <li>, I really wish it was right because I really wanted to try this.</li>
      <li>As for the minor blemishes, it did ok for coverage there.</li>
      <li>I used a bigger face brush since the tiny brush that came with the set really wouldn&#x27;t provide a good application.</li>
      <li>I would definitely purchase full sized products after the sample I received!</li>
      <li>It actually had pretty good coverage for a loose powder.</li>
      <li>My skin is oily and I have large pores.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t really cover them at all.</li>
      <li>really like the texture.</li>
      <li>It blends very well and doesn&#x27;t even appear that I had any &amp;#34;foundation&amp;#34; on.</li>
      <li>I think it costs too much.</li>
      <li>I am very please.</li>
      <li>This provided no coverage I used the whole trial size in one day</li>
      <li>If you had a pretty clear face without much going on, you could probably use it as a travel size for vacations/trips.</li>
      <li>It went on effortlessly with the precious little brush included, and really improved the look and feel of my skin.</li>
      <li>I had previously bought a starter set of Bare Minerals and jumped at the chance to buy this trial size at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Sample size that one would expect to get for free when trying a product. Terribly disappointing. Not worth the cost. Maybe a few bucks, but def not what they&#x27;re charging. Just go to a store and buy the real deal and don&#x27;t waste your money like I did.</li>
    <li> DISCLAIMER: I received a product discount for my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of bareMinerals in Fairly Light. I normally use a darker shade, but I thought I would give this one a chance. I was pleasantly surprised, it covered up my rosacea and dark circles, without looking like I was made up. It was light, easy to apply and didn&#x27;t make my face itch. Because I touch my face often, I assume I will need to reapply the powder at least once during the day. Time will tell though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bareMinerals is a well known product line, and this powder foundation lives up to its name.</li>
    <li> I got this product through amazon review trader. It is the person trial size. I like the formula, not too heavy and let my freckles through, which is what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I was not able to review this, the code i was given was not valid</li>
    <li> Save your money. I received the \\&quot;trial set\\&quot; and realized it is the same as the sample I received free for the asking from Ulta some time back. The sample is about 2-3 days worth of product, and not worth the $6.98 I just paid. I use Bare Minerals foundation and highly recommend the product; it&#x27;s just not a good value in this micro mini size.</li>
    <li> When I received my Bare Escentuals original Foundation trial I was surprised at how small it was, and was for the price. However, once I used it I realized how far a small amount can go. Although the sample is small I expect it to last me awhile since I only have to use very little to cover my face. It gives a polished look without feeling heavy or unnatural. I would recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> This is the second set that I&#x27;ve purchased like this, and due to the higher price and the photo pictured, I assumed it would be a bigger sample/trial. I was wrong. And the photo pictures a twisty container. The sample is definitely not in a container like this. It&#x27;s absolutely tiny. And even in its tinyness, it&#x27;s not full at all. I&#x27;m giving it the rating that I have because the product itself is great. It went on effortlessly with the precious little brush included, and really improved the look and feel of my skin. It was so soft and even looking! So to sum this up: great product if purchased in a larger size at a fair price. Samples should not cost so much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Discounted for evaluation</li>
    <li> Size should be specified. this was a joke! These are free sample size that you can get at Ulta for free!!!!</li>
    <li> Gives full coverage. Matched my skin perfectly</li>
    <li> In love this this I have super sensitive skin and I have had zero reactions to this make up at all and it is also a very pretty color!!</li>
    <li> This is listed as a &#x27;trial size&#x27; which is not really true. This is just a sample with little more than one time use. The packaging is nice and the brush is very cute, but beware of how tiny this is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color was true to the description. It actually had pretty good coverage for a loose powder. It covered some of my slight redness in my cheeks. I used this without a foundation and I imagine it would have worked great with a liquid foundation below for better coverage. I would recommend the product, not this trial size though.</li>
    <li> Love this product . Nice coverage , silky soft powder . I do think the sample is slightly smaller then I expected but all in all the product is great .</li>
    <li> This is part of daily make up routine, and has been for s couple years now. I am very glad to have found this product for such a good deal, and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I love this! I don&#x27;t like liquid foundation but still want coverage and this does it!! It lets your skin breathe and gives it a healthy look and feel</li>
    <li> Wow the foundation is great I now know what high end means.!! I have never owned anything from bare minerals but I&#x27;ll differently buy more tall so amazing and don&#x27;t even get me started on the brush so soft:)</li>
    <li> I like this trial size offering! I&#x27;ve seen many reviews that complain about the size of the product-in the description, it is clearly stated that it is a trial size.  I love the mineral product. It covers well-even on my skin that is combination with redness. It does take me quite a bit of the product to cover my redness, but that happens with any product. The color matches my pale skin well!  The brush is small, but does well for a smaller skin area. It does take a little while to cover my whole face (including the red patches on my face).  I would highly recommend this as a purse touch up kit. For my purposes, I wouldn&#x27;t take this on a multiple day vacation/trip because of the amount of product it takes to cover my face. If you had a pretty clear face without much going on, you could probably use it as a travel size for vacations/trips. I did receive this in an exchange for a review.</li>
    <li> I was glad to find this in a sample size to test out.  I love the original foundation but sometimes I need different shades in summer and winter.  This one is probably going to be good for both.  I plan on ordering more of this.</li>
    <li> Nice coverage . . . really like the texture.</li>
    <li> I love when my makeup is light and isn&#x27;t pasty. So when I was offered this Bare Minerals Powder Foundation from Bare Escentuals for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion and thoughts about it, I definitely ordered it to try and see how the look compares to liquid foundation. It arrived and I&#x27;ve been using it for almost two weeks now. No breakouts, and the powder is great as far as looks go. I definitely recommend this Bare Minerals Powder Foundation from Bare Escentuals for anyone who wants a great light foundation.</li>
    <li> Love it very light weight and looks great lasted for most of busy day</li>
    <li> Great smooth powder I have light skin tone. Blends well no caking up in corners of eyes. Very loose powder. Comes in a small plastic jar the size of your thumb. It&#x27;s a one-time application. Will help you decide on what color you need for the price.</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth lightweight and I like the feel</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always in search of a good powder foundation and I like this brand so I was pleased to find this in a sample size. I&#x27;m hesitant to purchase a full size when I&#x27;m testing out makeup but even more so when it&#x27;s not a drug store brand. Read through the directions first as they specify how to apply this to get the best results. This powder was easy to use. The mini brush that came with it was functional but too stiff for my preference and too small for every day use. I applied the powder to the brush, taping off any excess and used a circular buffing motion to apply. I normally use a BB cream with the lightest touch so it took a few tries to get the right amount of light coverage. The makeup lasted all day and didn&#x27;t feel caked on or heavy. The color was not a good choice for my skin tone though. I am fair but this shade left a yellow look to my skin. I would consider trying a different shade to see if I get better results. I received a discounted price to purchase this product in exchange for leaving a ewview.</li>
    <li> Teeny, Tiny container that comes with a teeny tiny brush.  Just the right size for a weekend getaway.  Really did smooth out skin and toned down the darker freckles and dare I say it? AGE SPOTS.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing, a little too light for my skin tone. I love how light and free it makes my skin feel!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard the hype and wasn&#x27;t sure I believed it, until trying this powder. My skin immediately looked softer and smoother and I was very happy with the light, yet thorough, coverage. The included brush is good quality and doesn&#x27;t leave hairs behind. I don&#x27;t wear heavy makeup and the Bare Escentuals powder gave a perfect amount of skin-correction without feeling caked on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I was asked to write a review for this product! I love mineral makeup but this brand is exceptional. I only applied it once. It blends very well and doesn&#x27;t even appear that I had any &amp;#34;foundation&amp;#34; on. It is very light feeling, not heavy like some liquid foundations. Does not appear to feel or look cakey. I am very please. I will continue to purchase this brand. A+</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to order this, was having problems either with the code or amazon because the price wasn&#x27;t coming up correctly, I really wish it was right because I really wanted to try this.</li>
    <li> This provided no coverage I used the whole trial size in one day and I still had to apply foundation. The brush it came with was small and rough on the skin it was all in all a bad product. I do not think this was the real bare minerals as I have used their products in the past.&lt;br /&gt;I got a very small discount down to $5 for this and it was not worth the amount I paid for it</li>
    <li> This makeup is wonderful! It leaves your skin feeling so soft and smooth! It feels like your not wearing any makeup at all! I would definitely recommend! I will be ordering more!</li>
    <li> Product came quickly and nicely packaged. It was brand new and came with cute little brush!</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this product through amazon review trader, and its amazing. full coverage and matched my skintone perfectly. I do wish the sample brush was a little bigger though.</li>
    <li> love love love this product!</li>
    <li> I have been dying to try bareMinerals foundations. I&#x27;ve seen all the rage and hype on tv and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it myself. I was very excited to receive this foundation at a discount in exchange for my honest review. For starters, while I knew that I was purchasing a sample size (I like to have samples to carry in my makeup bag rather than full size products) I was shocked at how tiny this sample is for the price! This sample is literally the size of a quarter. Not what I was expecting at all. Samples that I have purchased from other name brands were perfect for my cosmetics bag for multiple uses on the go. This one is tiny but won&#x27;t be used but once or twice. That part is a bummer. As for the product itself..... I tried it on several areas of my skin- some with no blemishes, some with very minor blemishes, and some with significant blemishes. The color matched my skin pretty well but the coverage was not what I expected from the product after seeing the commercials, etc. For the areas with no blemishes it covered well, although I didn&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;airbrushed&amp;#34; look that I was expecting. As for the minor blemishes, it did ok for coverage there. For significant blemishes, forget it. It didn&#x27;t really cover them at all. I have had better coverage from other, more affordable brands. Sorry Bare Escentuals, not what I was hoping for. :-(</li>
    <li> LOVE BM brand&lt;br /&gt;Great coverage</li>
    <li> Cutest bare minerals I&#x27;ve ever seen. It&#x27;s doll size.. You don&#x27;t hardly get anything but it&#x27;s an awesome size to keep in purse for touch ups; also, it came with a teeny tiny buki brush which I love:)</li>
    <li> The product itself is awesome and makes my skin long much younger and healthier that most products that I have tried! I would definitely purchase full sized products after the sample I received!</li>
    <li> I love bareMinerals. This was a very tiny little set but the perfect tester for color matching. I used a bigger face brush since the tiny brush that came with the set really wouldn&#x27;t provide a good application. Perfect for tossing in your purse for touch ups on the go!</li>
    <li> This is very minimal coverage. I had never tried bare minerals products before this. I was shocked and disappointed with with how small it is. This is a sample size. I think it costs too much. This is not something I would normally buy. With all that being said, I tried it on my wrist first, it looked like foundation. I got only one use out of this little thing because I need a fuller coverage product. There is a reason you don&#x27;t see professionals raving about this anywhere but commercials. It doesn&#x27;t cover blemishes at all. I understand that they have concealers for that though. I am still giving five stars even though it&#x27;s not for me because it is a good product. I just think you have to have great skin to see the benefits of it. It works like it should and I am glad I got to try it. I purchased this product at a discount for my honest review. My photo is with an american quarter to show size.</li>
    <li> Product is good but sample size is pitiful. Barely covered one application. Pun-intended.</li>
    <li> I cannot say how much I love this foundation. I have always struggled with finding the right foundation. My skin is oily and I have large pores. It has always been a challenge to find a foundation that provides good, even coverage and minimizes pores without feeling like it&#x27;s caked on. This foundation is a life changer. I had previously bought a starter set of Bare Minerals and jumped at the chance to buy this trial size at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review. This is a trial size, small size container, that comes with a small brush. It&#x27;s tiny enough to put in a change purse and drop it in your bag when you&#x27;re on the go. A little bit goes a long way with this powder foundation. You swirl the brush in the powder, tap off the excess, then apply the foundation in small circular motions on your face. It feels like you&#x27;re not wearing foundation at all! The best thing for me is that it keeps my oily skin at bay for several hours, and provides excellent coverage and minimizes the look of pores. I definitely recommend this product!</li>
