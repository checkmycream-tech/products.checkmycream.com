      <li>Thanks Island Deodorant for making a great product that WORKS!</li>
      <li>Love this amazing deodorant.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Although I like the stick version too and it works just as well, the cream version is my favorite.</li>
      <li>I used to love the vegan one the most</li>
      <li>This is my favorite deodorant, bar none.</li>
      <li>And B) after learning about the dangers of the ingredients found in most store bought deodorants.</li>
      <li>Went on a quest once again to find a deodorant that could help me with my BO and that was safe to use.</li>
      <li>This deodorant works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used..</li>
      <li>where I am going to be around people 6 or more hours after putting this one.</li>
      <li>this will be your favorite deodorant.</li>
      <li>I love that its a cream.</li>
      <li>I also do use a drop of scented oil under each arm so that, when I do sweat, I smell like peaches :)</li>
      <li>Love this deodorant.</li>
      <li>Gotta love it. :-)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m excited about the customer service!</li>
      <li>I really liked this product and initially it was great</li>
      <li>Overall, a very good, non-toxic deodorant.</li>
      <li>A natural deodorant that is effective and safe to use!</li>
      <li>A natural deodorant that is effective and safe to use!</li>
      <li>It was the first time I heard people get enthusiastic about a deodorant.</li>
      <li>but now I love this cream one just as much!!</li>
      <li>My clients don&#x27;t have a stinky tour guide and I feel more confident when I don&#x27;t catch a wiff of my own body odor as I point out flora fauna and historical sites along the way.</li>
      <li>the end of all this I&#x27;m not only happy with the product, company but the customer service as well</li>
      <li>I think that&#x27;s what sets apart this deodorant from others, and I&#x27;m proud to say it&#x27;s handmade in batches by a local lady.</li>
      <li>I have been on the quest for a natural, organic, and most importantly effective deodorant for about 2 years now.</li>
      <li>I also love that i can add a few drops of my favorite scented essential oil, and have a delightfully scented deodorant.</li>
      <li>Makes complete sense since our skin is filled with bacteria that are more useful than harmful to us and BO is also caused by bacteria!</li>
      <li>This stuff convinced me that natural/organic not only is better for you, but works better than the store bought/name brand kinds.  </li>
      <li>It has a mild &#x27;putty&#x27; scent.  </li>
      <li>I sent off my response and got a reply quickly thereafter.</li>
      <li>I made the switch to aluminum free deodorants after A) Dove CLINICAL protection had no effect on my underarm odor at all (*emphasis on clinical*)...</li>
      <li>ANYWAY, it will be number one (though I am a variety junkie) and ALWAYS in my cabinet (unless there is a new brand I like better).  </li>
      <li>This one doesn&#x27;t irritate, but it also doesn&#x27;t keep me fresh all day.  </li>
      <li>I love the fact that it has completely natural ingredients and it is made in Florida instead of</li>
      <li>I bought some grapefruit essential oil to add a nice fresh scent to it and applied the cream to my underarms.</li>
      <li>I love that I&#x27;m not using chemicals under my arms and this is made with all natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>Who knew my nation-wide quest for all-natural deodorants would end virtually right in my backyard?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>right</li>
      <li>I have been a loyal customer first to the product for how well it performs day after day working often in the hot Floridian sun.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve got full bottles of every other kind out there</li>
      <li>but unfortunately, not this one.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping!</li>
      <li>First let me say I enjoy trying natural deodorants.  </li>
      <li>The probiotics really work!  </li>
      <li>I bought two more of these for my daughter to use as well, and my husband and son are using the stick type of the same brand.</li>
      <li>Thank you so much for your vision and dedication!</li>
      <li>I lead bike and kayak tours and sweat ALOT in the hot Florida Keys sun.</li>
      <li>If you have other areas where using fingers is necessary and where these great ingredients may be useful then give it a try.</li>
      <li>and I will be a customer of Island Deodorant for as long as they are available on the market!</li>
      <li>It was easy for me to learn to apply it with two fingers, and it has become second nature.</li>
      <li>Switched back to the first deodorant I used when I went aluminum free</li>
      <li>I know it is the baking soda as before I have gone just the coconut oil and baking soda route, and the baking soda always irritates my skin after a certain amount of time.</li>
      <li>I still really like the product.</li>
      <li>Very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have my whole family using it</li>
      <li>It ducked because I really did like this product.</li>
      <li>Thank you so much for creating this.</li>
      <li>All my clothes after wearing them, for even just four hours, have a very off putting smell.</li>
      <li>this was only available now as an &amp;#34;add</li>
      <li>This deodorant is the real deal.</li>
      <li>So smooth, goes on easily and last all day long too!!</li>
      <li>When I went back to the original order on Amazon</li>
      <li>At first I was leaning towards buying the lavender deodorant sticks which Island Deodorant offers</li>
      <li>Keeps me dry and odor free.  </li>
      <li>Caused a slight rash, but was better after not using for a day or so</li>
      <li>After having tried literally a dozen natural deodorant brands over the years, I was never really quite satisfied.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many brands in the 15 years I&#x27;ve been looking for a non-toxic deodorant and Island deodorant is the ONLY one I have ever found that actually stops smelly underarms.</li>
      <li>It does go on clean and feels dry in a moment or two.  </li>
      <li>The only deodorant around that keeps me feeling fresh and from itching.</li>
      <li>I inquired about it and was surprised to hear the lady who manufactures it at home lives only a little more than an hour away!</li>
      <li>Works all day long and DOESN&#x27;T contain SUGAR like some many of the other natural deodorants!!!</li>
      <li>I have spent so much money looking for the right one and now I&#x27;ve found it.</li>
      <li>If you can get past the paste application (which is not my favorite, but I tolerate it for this product)</li>
      <li>However, all natural deodorant creams use baking soda, so this is something I just have to live with.</li>
      <li>One day a group of my friends was raving about this new natural deodorant.</li>
      <li>This is the first and only natural deodorant to work that well for me.</li>
      <li>So I buy a lot of natural and organic deodorants.  </li>
      <li>Then the effect started diminishing till it became completely ineffective for my underarm odor.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this product five stars because of the customer service received. I got an email from Island Deodorant a couple weeks after my purchase to see how everything was working out. I was thankful to hear from them, because I hadn&#x27;t really been having the best results. I sent off my response and got a reply quickly thereafter. The company refunded my money and gave me some feedback regarding the issues I had been having. I was floored! I didn&#x27;t ask for a refund, but their response has garnered this five-star review AND my willingness to keep trying to make this deodorant work for me. I&#x27;ll pass on a tip for other customers to try: If the scent of this product isn&#x27;t to your liking, try mixing in a few drops of essential oil. I plan on trying this ASAP! Moral of the story...try Island Deodorant. You can&#x27;t go wrong with that kind of service.  EDIT 6/16/15: I can now report that this deodorant definitely does WORK! It effectively stops B.O. from becoming an issue and one application lasts me about 24 hours!! This is the first and only natural deodorant to work that well for me. One caveat, though, is that I do sometimes develop a slight rash from the product--especially when I wear clothing that rubs under my arm. I believe the culprit is the baking soda, which is a bit abrasive. However, all natural deodorant creams use baking soda, so this is something I just have to live with.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this in bar form for over a year. I just tried this because I like the idea of mixing in essential oils. While that didn&#x27;t work so well for me I still really like the product. It is the only natural deodorant that hasn&#x27;t made me feel stinky and gross at the end of the day--that is, after my pits detoxed from the non-natural deodorants. I also do use a drop of scented oil under each arm so that, when I do sweat, I smell like peaches :)</li>
    <li> So I buy a lot of natural and organic deodorants.  And there are a few I really like.  Thought I would like this one because coconut oil based deodorants seem to work well with my body chemistry to stop odor and don&#x27;t irritate my underarms.  This one doesn&#x27;t irritate, but it also doesn&#x27;t keep me fresh all day.  So I will probably end up using it all, but never for work or where I am going to be around people 6 or more hours after putting this one.</li>
    <li> This works. If you can get past the paste application (which is not my favorite, but I tolerate it for this product) this will be your favorite deodorant. I&#x27;ve tried at least 15 natural deodorants with varying degrees of success, but nothing ever worked as well as this. I was odorless at the end of the day - and I walk dogs for a living. Very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re thinking about trying this deodorant, do it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;note: I also purchased the stick version of this deodorant after trying this less expensive version and being totally sold on it. The one I received had some crystallized shea butter and the business owner actually just contacted me about replacing my stick. I&#x27;m excited about the customer service!</li>
    <li> This is the best deodorant I have ever used. Not just the best &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorant but the best of all types, including antiperspirants.</li>
    <li> This stuff convinced me that natural/organic not only is better for you, but works better than the store bought/name brand kinds.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I really liked this product and initially it was great but after about a month of use my pits began breaking out in a horrible rash. Everything went back to normal after I discontinued use of this product. It ducked because I really did like this product.</li>
    <li> I used to love the vegan one the most but now I love this cream one just as much!! So smooth, goes on easily and last all day long too!! I will continue to be a customer of this product for a long time. Thanks Island Deodorant for making a great product that WORKS!</li>
    <li> This deoderant did not work for me.  I have used organic deoderant before and loved it...but unfortunately, not this one.  I have hyperhidrosis which is excessive sweating so I&#x27;m sort of a deoderant connoisseur.  This deoderant actually made me stink.  I will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Love the product ! Just as described ! Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews, but I feel I have to share my experience with Island Deodorant. I have been a loyal customer first to the product for how well it performs day after day working often in the hot Floridian sun. I love the fact that it has completely natural ingredients and it is made in Florida instead of China.&lt;br /&gt;Recently I received a jar that it did not meet my usual expectation and since the owner of Island Deodorant always follows up with her customers, I decided to reach out to her. I would like to say that she has provided me with the best customer care service that I have ever experienced. She did not just explain to me what I have to do to fix the problem with the product, but also that in case the products did still not meet my expectation she would replace it. This might sounds to you as a regular warranty call, but I have to assure you that she has been in complete contact with me throughout the process and when at the end I still had to replace it, no questions asked, she sent me the replacement right away.&lt;br /&gt;At the end of all this I&#x27;m not only happy with the product, company but the customer service as well and they have me as a lifelong customer. I&#x27;m recommending this product to my family and friends as well. Thank you Jennifer for your help and your great products.</li>
    <li> Just ordered two more! One for me and one to share! Love this amazing deodorant. I lead bike and kayak tours and sweat ALOT in the hot Florida Keys sun. The probiotics really work!  My clients don&#x27;t have a stinky tour guide and I feel more confident when I don&#x27;t catch a wiff of my own body odor as I point out flora fauna and historical sites along the way.</li>
    <li> Jennifer sent this to us as a sample with her other product in a tube.  I haven&#x27;t tried this product as an underarm deodorant because I am not a fan of needing to use fingers to put on underarm deodorant.  However I did try this in another area that has a tendency to perspire and then get rashy.  It works great in that area as it has no harmful ingredients at all.  If you have other areas where using fingers is necessary and where these great ingredients may be useful then give it a try.</li>
    <li> I have been using this deodorant for months and its absolutely my favorite!  I have tried numerous &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; products but this one surpasses them all! I am so thankful to have found Organic Island Deodorant! It lasts all day and I don&#x27;t have to worry about putting harmful chemicals on my body!</li>
    <li> This is the BEST natural deodorant cream I&#x27;ve ever used!!!!!! I have tried several others, only to be disappointed that half way through a hot, humid day they didnt work...This deodorant works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used..I also love that i can add a few drops of my favorite scented essential oil, and have a delightfully scented deodorant. Used alone, or with an essential oil this works..I have my whole family using it and they all agree that it is the best!!!!!! I love that I&#x27;m not using chemicals under my arms and this is made with all natural ingredients. The probiotics are another plus! Try this, you wont be disappointed!!!!! :-)</li>
    <li> Works all day long and DOESN&#x27;T contain SUGAR like some many of the other natural deodorants!!! Love this deodorant. You still sweat, but you DON&#x27;T stink, and you DON&#x27;T end up with thrush in the armpit from SUGAR being in the deodorant. Gotta love it. :-)</li>
    <li> First let me say I enjoy trying natural deodorants.  Having said that and having tried 40 or so at least.  My favorites are this one number one, close second are the Weleda spray series, and also an etsy Daly&#x27;s brand.  Also I like Purely Great.  (And haven&#x27;t tried a lot of brands like Herban so the jury will still be out on those----am figuring out what I like before I retire and while money is less of an issue).  ANYWAY if I am in NYC and running around all day in 15 deg weather, only a stick aluminum toxic antiperspirant deodorant works.  HOWEVER, for camping, and for a recent super stressful trip to Los Angeles (medical tourism hooray husband doesn&#x27;t have cancer), where we were driving in crazy traffic, had the big flood, were outside on some days touring etceteras, this stuff worked like the bomb.  It has a mild &#x27;putty&#x27; scent.  It lasts a long time.  When I went back to the original order on Amazon this was only available now as an &amp;#34;add on&amp;#34;.  ANYWAY, it will be number one (though I am a variety junkie) and ALWAYS in my cabinet (unless there is a new brand I like better).  I have a job that can be mega stressful (ill patients upset families, insurance paperwork from h_ll) and I always smell good at the end of the day, even with meetings from h_ll where you feel that sweat when you get pissed off.  I still smell good.  Take that you insurance paperwork monsters.</li>
    <li> From my experience, you should wash your underarms before bed time with this and some other natural products. Caused a slight rash, but was better after not using for a day or so</li>
    <li> This deodorant works!! I have tried so many brands in the 15 years I&#x27;ve been looking for a non-toxic deodorant and Island deodorant is the ONLY one I have ever found that actually stops smelly underarms. I have used in all sort of heat and it never fails, from the dry heat of the Arizona desert to the humidity of a swampy South Carolina summer. Thank you so much for creating this. I have spent so much money looking for the right one and now I&#x27;ve found it.</li>
    <li> I have been on the quest for a natural, organic, and most importantly effective deodorant for about 2 years now. I made the switch to aluminum free deodorants after A) Dove CLINICAL protection had no effect on my underarm odor at all (*emphasis on clinical*)... Clinical strength is considered the strongest type of deodorant on the market for very strong underarm odor and while it worked for a few months, it abruptly stopped working... And B) after learning about the dangers of the ingredients found in most store bought deodorants. I went ahead and googled a recipe for natural deodorant made at home and yet again, for a few months it worked like a charm... Then the effect started diminishing till it became completely ineffective for my underarm odor. Switched back to the first deodorant I used when I went aluminum free which was Toms of Maine but that was useless. Then switched from Toms of Maine to Nature&#x27;s Gate which was worse than Toms of Maine in regards to -0 effect on my BO. Went on a quest once again to find a deodorant that could help me with my BO and that was safe to use. I stumbled upon Organic Island Deodorant (and I thank God for that). At first I was leaning towards buying the lavender deodorant sticks which Island Deodorant offers but then I found the cream deodorant with probiotics. Why didn&#x27;t it occur to me that the solution to my BO could be a deodorant with probiotics? Makes complete sense since our skin is filled with bacteria that are more useful than harmful to us and BO is also caused by bacteria! I used this deodorant the very same day I received it (30 min after checking my mailbox 😁). I bought some grapefruit essential oil to add a nice fresh scent to it and applied the cream to my underarms. It worked like magic! In a few minutes my BO was gone! This deodorant has legitimately restored my faith in natural deodorants once again and I will be a customer of Island Deodorant for as long as they are available on the market! I get the best of both worlds... A natural deodorant that is effective and safe to use! I am also able to stimulate the economy of a small business that runs out of my home state! Yes! Thank you once again!both worlds... A natural deodorant that is effective and safe to use! I am also able to stimulate the economy of a small business that runs out of my home state! Yes!

    <li> The only deodorant around that keeps me feeling fresh and from itching. I recently started itching with any deodorant I tried and I had just stopped using deodorant altogether. I saw this so I decided to try. I&#x27;ve got full bottles of every other kind out there so what&#x27;s one more! It gives me reliefvfom the itching and keeps me from being smelly. I love that its a cream. I will definitely continue to use this product!</li>
    <li> A well-made, natural product.  The owner, Jennifer, reached out to see how the product worked for me.  I was very impressed by that.  I would definitely recommend the product and company!</li>
    <li> Great dedodorant. No smell &amp; works well. I can&#x27;t use 98% of deodorants in stores or online because they give me rashes or swollen lymph nodes. I&#x27;m extremely grateful to find a gentle enough deodorant that works very well.</li>
    <li> After having tried literally a dozen natural deodorant brands over the years, I was never really quite satisfied. One day a group of my friends was raving about this new natural deodorant. I was curious, as I wondered what warranted such fandom. It was the first time I heard people get enthusiastic about a deodorant. I inquired about it and was surprised to hear the lady who manufactures it at home lives only a little more than an hour away! I decided to try it and since then have never looked back. This deodorant is the real deal. Nontoxic, fragrance-free, and the best part, it lasts! All day long, through hot, humid days, through cold days, through exercise. This is my favorite deodorant, bar none. In fact, I&#x27;m not going to be using anything else. I bought two more of these for my daughter to use as well, and my husband and son are using the stick type of the same brand. All are satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the probiotics in it is genius. I think that&#x27;s what sets apart this deodorant from others, and I&#x27;m proud to say it&#x27;s handmade in batches by a local lady. Thank you so much for your vision and dedication! Who knew my nation-wide quest for all-natural deodorants would end virtually right in my backyard?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I like the stick version too and it works just as well, the cream version is my favorite. It was easy for me to learn to apply it with two fingers, and it has become second nature.</li>
    <li> My family uses this daily, but it gave me a rash. Works as described for them.</li>
    <li> This product works quite well.  Keeps me dry and odor free.  Would prefer a stick application, however.  It does go on clean and feels dry in a moment or two.  Overall, a very good, non-toxic deodorant.</li>
    <li> I had such high hopes for this deodorant and was very disappointed. The smell is off-putting and nothing like the title &amp;#34;Island&amp;#34; suggests. I was hoping for something a bit more pleasant. You will still sweat when you use it, as it isn&#x27;t a anti-perspirant, but you will STILL SMELL when you sweat. All my clothes after wearing them, for even just four hours, have a very off putting smell. Also, after about a week of use it irritated my under arms and I got a red rash from the baking soda. I know it is the baking soda as before I have gone just the coconut oil and baking soda route, and the baking soda always irritates my skin after a certain amount of time. DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
