<li> I had to squeeze it and that made a mess.</li>
<li> I also find that I get the product a few days after ordering.</li>
<li> It does not feel sticky or heavy.  </li>
<li> Usually purchase luminess at $50 per .55 oz bottle</li>
<li> It makes it hard to buy makeup.</li>
<li> I did not like the product because the makeup is so thick it will not drip into my airbrush.</li>
<li> This makeup worked with my Luminess and was a lot less expensive.  </li>
<li> Terrible does even come out of bottle</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Usually purchase luminess at $50 per .55 oz bottle but once I found the right color  of this Glam Air I actually prefer it over luminess at a fifth of the price. My skin looked perfect for an entire day even after moving things in and out of a storage unit.&lt;br /&gt;GREAT BUY! Dont waste your money on the other brands.</li>
    <li> This makeup worked with my Luminess and was a lot less expensive.  It went on smooth and even and I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> Its not that I didn&#x27;t like the product necessarily. The makeup was natural looking once applied but the bottle ran out sooooo quickly. Even with normal application. It did clog my machine every time I used it. I shook the bottle and when I tried to put the makeup into my machine, it just would not come out of the bottle. I had to squeeze it and that made a mess. Once applies to my face it was pretty and stayed on all day.</li>
    <li> When applying this product, I noticed it was quite watery compared to other brands I have used before ( dinair, luminess air). But the coverage is excellent, I could not be more pleased. The color is a perfect match to my skin tone, I ordered \\&quot;summer tan\\&quot; (m8). As well, the price of this product was quite cheap. I will re-order!</li>
    <li> I love this makeup because I can mix it with another color to get my correct shade. Fast fast delivery. I am very pleased that I do not have to wait long to get it. Your company is very dependable.</li>
    <li> Great product used it for a wedding and it photographed beautifully. Delivery was fast. Will be order again. Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> I love this makeup, I have a lot of red tones in my skin and so much makeup has too much of a pink or orange base. It makes it hard to buy makeup. This product gives good coverage and feels like no makeup. I also find that I get the product a few days after ordering. Good Job Glam Air Inc. Please expand your line of air brush lotions and finishing sprays because I&#x27;m looking to BUY.</li>
    <li> This is a great price and works great I have a luminess system and I would rather pay this price than the luminess make up price.  I would regimens this to anyone with an airbrush system. I will definitely buy again .</li>
    <li> I ordered this product (Glam Air Airbrush - M8 Summer Tan Matte Foundation Makeup) and I love it.  It goes on smoothly and light but more importantly, it stays on all day.  I do not need to \\&quot;refresh\\&quot; after a couple of hours.  It gives me a very natural look.  I am a satisfy customer who will be ordering more in the future.</li>
    <li> Terrible does even come out of bottle&lt;br /&gt;Both bottles same issue</li>
    <li> Good foundation. It does not make my skin sticky like some others. It is very thin, so I have to use a lot more drops to get full coverage.</li>
    <li> I did not like the product because the makeup is so thick it will not drip into my airbrush. Will not buy again</li>

    <li> Good just a tad darker then my skin tone</li>
    <li> This foundation made my skin look flawless.  Mae-up stays on and did not irritate my skin at all.  It felt very light on the skin but gave me the flawaless coverage I wanted.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and the product is awesome.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s perfect! Makes me look photo shopped in all my pictures. Buy the bigger bottle because you&#x27;re not going to use anything else after you get spoiled with this. I bought the small one but buying the bigger bottle soon. LOVE LOVE LOVE.</li>
    <li> Works ok,  good coverage,  but clumpy in bottle. Sometimes nothing will come out sometimes way too much comes out.  I will try another brand next time.</li>
    <li> Love the product. Fast delivery. Thank you.</li>
