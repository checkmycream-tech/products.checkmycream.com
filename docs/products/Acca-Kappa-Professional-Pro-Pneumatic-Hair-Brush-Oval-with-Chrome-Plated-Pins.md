      <li>I love this brush so much I bought 2 more - one for my downstairs bathroom and one for my handbag/to travel with.</li>
      <li>edit below)I bought this brush mostly because I was looking for a high quality metal brush that wouldn&#x27;t conduct static like my plastic brushes.</li>
      <li>Great if you have an oily scalp but dry hair.</li>
      <li>The pins will come out when trying to clean the brush by pulling on the pins.</li>
      <li>The metal tines are very well made and very smooth -- so no pulling and fraying and splitting of hair when you&#x27;re brusing or styling.  </li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll be glad purchased it as much as me.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things .....</li>
      <li>I have never spent $30 on a brush but am glad I did!</li>
      <li>I have long hair and this brush brushes well.. comfortable and nice paddle.</li>
      <li>This is well worth the purchase price.</li>
      <li>This Acca Kappa brush is worth every dime paid.</li>
      <li>OK, so I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve spent $35+ for a hair brush before, but this one is truly worth it!  </li>
      <li>I am purchasing that second brush now and hope to have them for many years.</li>
      <li>When my similar brush became unusable I went in search and found this brush which is an even better design</li>
      <li>Is it possible to be in love with a brush?</li>
      <li>I came back here now to update my review and order 2 more.</li>
      <li>If I did have to replace it, I would buy this exact one again and again.</li>
      <li>It appears to be well designed with rounded steel bristles that show no signs of wearing or falling out after the first months of use.</li>
      <li>My old brush (same kind) is now losing it&#x27;s teeth</li>
      <li>Not sure if it is good to use with a hair dryer because of how the metal would heat, so be cautious of that is what you plan to do.</li>
      <li>I have had it for four months, it is great for untangling wet or dry hair.</li>
      <li>I have long, fine, straight hair that is prone to static all winter long.</li>
      <li>The pull is somewhere between pulling my hair too much and massaging my scalp.  </li>
      <li>I have been using it for 2 months and really like this brush</li>
      <li>I really like the feel of it</li>
      <li>how much did this cost?&#x27;.</li>
      <li>(My hair is straight, below shoulder length, medium-weight.)  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using a wood bristle brush for years, but now I will change to metal bristles because they flow through my hair much easier.</li>
      <li>This brush not only helps with static (it doesn&#x27;t eliminate it completely</li>
      <li>I first purchased \\&quot;Acca Kappa Professional Pro Pneumatic Hair Brush, Oval, Chrome</li>
      <li>I could maybe put it back with some super glue.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
      <li>Worth the extra money for a quality product</li>
      <li>The vent brushes just do not work with her fine hair, and other paddle brushes end up falling apart with use or scratching the scalp when the ends of the tines start to break or fall off.  </li>
      <li>On my first try, the head of the brush fell out of the wooden frame!</li>
      <li>I had 3 of these brushes previously and at first I loved them, but then quickly realized that the pins would get pushed into the base of the brush really easily.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was refunded for the brush, and eventually decided to try \\&quot;Acca Kappa Professional Pro Pneumatic Hair Brush, Oval with Chrome Plated Pins\\&quot;</li>
      <li>Old review:  </li>
      <li>If you brush your hair for 5-10 minutes, you can feel the natural oils in your scalp spreading evenly all the way to the tips.</li>
      <li>so it stands up straight - especially a problem if I keep thebrush in a bag.</li>
      <li>I had a brush from the body shop in the 90s that was similar in style and really was &#x27;heavenly&#x27;, but they stopped making them sometime in the 00s.</li>
      <li>I saw the reviews on this one - plus I bought one in Las Vegas that was wood handle with soft plastic bristles - so decided to try it.  </li>
      <li>I have curly, thick hair and love this brush.  </li>
      <li>I have long S-curl hair that tangles so much</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been a daily user for about a year and looks like you could sell it as brand new.</li>
      <li>The center cushion appears to be the same as the first brush only in a different color, and there&#x27;s a pretty metal trim around the cushion.  </li>
      <li>I purchased the Acca Kappa Professional Pneumatic Brush when I could not find the brush I have used for a couple years locally any longer.</li>
      <li>Although this brush is a little small, it is fabulous!  </li>

<li> (the one with the black cushion) which is titled on the handle \\&quot;353 Professional Acca Kappa</li>

<li> &quot; The handles are 3.5\\&quot; long, the total brush length 8.5\\&quot; long and 2.5\\&quot; wide at the widest part.  </li>
<li> I have long thick straight hair</li>
<li> The handle is a little too small for my very large hand, but I wanted a small brush to live on my desk to keep my hair under control.</li>
<li> I have had other brands and always come back to this one.</li>
<li> other than I&#x27;m ordering a second brush for ME today.</li>
<li> So I popped on amazon in the car on the ride home and ordered another, because I only had one other brush at home.</li>

    <li> Very high quality, metal pins are all one piece, so the little tips won&#x27;t break off as with other pin type brushes. I have had it for four months, it is great for untangling wet or dry hair. Absolutely no complaints. Seller is quick shipper, be sure to order the Amazon Prime seller.</li>
    <li> Update :  The bristle part of the brush has come off the wooden handle.  I could maybe put it back with some super glue.  Otherwise a great brush for my bamboo-thick hair.</li>
    <li> I have curly, thick hair and love this brush.  The brush grabs the my hair nicely.  The pull is somewhere between pulling my hair too much and massaging my scalp.  I gave the product 5 stars because it feels nice.  The brush is well made and fits comfortably in my hand.      One caveat, the brush is slightly smaller than I thought it would be.  I didn&#x27;t measure.  It&#x27;s more a travel brush size.</li>
    <li> Although this brush is a little small, it is fabulous!  My hair is thick, course, and very long.  The metal bristles glide through and don&#x27;t scratch my scalp in an uncomfortable manner.  I&#x27;ve been using it for several months and don&#x27;t anticipate needing to replace it any time soon.  If I did have to replace it, I would buy this exact one again and again.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush because i want something sharper to stimulate my scalp (aiming for longer hair!) and i love everything about it. I bough the boar blend. When you start brushing you can feel the pins massaging your scalp and it feels heavenly! If you brush your hair for 5-10 minutes, you can feel the natural oils in your scalp spreading evenly all the way to the tips. Great if you have an oily scalp but dry hair. This brush is an A+ for me!</li>
    <li> If you want a brush with chrome plated pins that won&#x27;t scratch or pull, this is your best bet. I had looked for a quality brush for a while with no luck. This is well worth the purchase price.</li>
    <li> my husband opened this package and praised the brush for the craftmanship. He was like &#x27;wow, this is a nice brush! how much did this cost?&#x27;. He thinks everything is &#x27;junk&#x27; so I was impressed. I have been using it for 2 months and really like this brush, my only complaint would be that it is a little too firm (not quite as heavenly as some say but &#x27;very nice&#x27;), but I think as I use it it will break it in. I had a brush from the body shop in the 90s that was similar in style and really was &#x27;heavenly&#x27;, but they stopped making them sometime in the 00s.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly well with my constantly tangled hair! Just start brushing from the bottom up. It&#x27;s my everyday brush and I love it!</li>
    <li> This brush is beautifully made and makes me want to brush my hair more.  I have long thick straight hair so it is difficult to find a hairbrush that detangles without snagging or sending my hair into flyaways with the static.  This brush has chrome ball-tipped pins so it doesn&#x27;t scratch.  They&#x27;re not plastic capped metal pins.  It&#x27;s perfect.  I know it&#x27;s expensive for a hairbrush but as a mom, I don&#x27;t allow myself or have time for many indulgences so I might as well make the 10 minutes I spend on myself a day happy.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Acca Kappa Professional Pneumatic Brush when I could not find the brush I have used for a couple years locally any longer. I brought it and the Phillips Light Touch. This Acca Kappa brush is worth every dime paid. I am actually sorry I wasted money trying the other brush, I should have just brought 2 of this one to start with (one for the handbag/one for home). I am purchasing that second brush now and hope to have them for many years.</li>
    <li> I have long thin hair so having the correct brush is essential for me. When my similar brush became unusable I went in search and found this brush which is an even better design then what I had. The handle is a bit shorter then my old one yet not so much it feel awkward. I love the fact the the bristles are formed with tips instead of plastic coated tips which always come off.</li>
    <li> Best hairbrush I have ever used. They last forever and massage the scalp when brushing. I have had other brands and always come back to this one.</li>
    <li> I wanted a good hair brush for my shoulder length hair and I didn&#x27;t want to pay a lot of money for a Mason Pearson.  I saw the reviews on this one - plus I bought one in Las Vegas that was wood handle with soft plastic bristles - so decided to try it.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 1/2 weeks now and I just love it.  It makes my hair shiny and healthier and I am convinced that I am losing less hair.  One co-worker said that she thought my hair looked longer. I highly recommend it.  The tines are chrome plated but do not hurt at all...they will also not wear out like the plastic brushes and actually seem to massage my scalp, as someone mentioned.  I think this is a great bargain for the money.</li>
    <li> I use this daily, like it a lot. The handle is a little too small for my very large hand, but I wanted a small brush to live on my desk to keep my hair under control. It is nice and scratchy on my scalp with the metal tines. Each tine has a small rounded head. With multiple-times-per-day use it seems like it will last years.</li>
    <li> no longer have to fight my daughter to brush her hair</li>
    <li> The pins will come out when trying to clean the brush by pulling on the pins. Careful!</li>
    <li> handle is to small for this brush,cushion part of brush is to stiff, should have a little more give.would be five stars with those changes.</li>
    <li> Updated 7/13/16  I had 3 of these brushes previously and at first I loved them, but then quickly realized that the pins would get pushed into the base of the brush really easily. So I would spend time every day pulling the pins back up. No thanks! But I still kept one around because despite having to do this, it&#x27;s a really good brush. I downgraded my review to 3 stars though because of this issue.  I recently took this brush with me a Phish concert and lost it there. So I popped on amazon in the car on the ride home and ordered another, because I only had one other brush at home. It arrived less than 2 days later (thank you, Prime!) and I was overjoyed to see that this brush has been improved so that the pins no longer get pushed in!! They stay exactly where they&#x27;re supposed to stay!!! I came back here now to update my review and order 2 more. This is the top notch brush, no need to spend more (I&#x27;m looking at you, Mason Pearson brushes!!). This brush is perfection.   Old review:  (see edit below)I bought this brush mostly because I was looking for a high quality metal brush that wouldn&#x27;t conduct static like my plastic brushes. I have long, fine, straight hair that is prone to static all winter long. This brush not only helps with static (it doesn&#x27;t eliminate it completely but it&#x27;s much better than plastic!), but it&#x27;s a perfect size, high quality, and attractive. The metal tines have a small ball at each end to help avoid snagging hair (they&#x27;re also metal, all part of the tine, not something that&#x27;s attached that could fall off) and it actually gives a little scalp massage as you brush. I love this brush so much I bought 2 more - one for my downstairs bathroom and one for my handbag/to travel with. I&#x27;ll never use another brush!  edited on 9/29/15: after using this brush for quite a while, I&#x27;m so disappointed that the tines get pushed in to the base of the brush. I have to individually pull each tine back up so it stands up straight - especially a problem if I keep thebrush in a bag. I&#x27;m tired of having to pull them back up where they belong. replacing all three brushes today.</li>
    <li> This is the best brush I&#x27;ve used. I have long S-curl hair that tangles so much I usually have to cut off tangles several times a month. I&#x27;ve been using a wood bristle brush for years, but now I will change to metal bristles because they flow through my hair much easier. The wood handle is medium brown and the oval around the bristle area is a metallic mirror.</li>
    <li> It looks like everyone else has a good experience with this product instead of me? I just received the brush today. On my first try, the head of the brush fell out of the wooden frame! I can see the dried glue inside the frame. This is absolutely unacceptable and my worst experience on Amazon so far!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my wife. It appears to be well designed with rounded steel bristles that show no signs of wearing or falling out after the first months of use.</li>
    <li> Is it possible to be in love with a brush? I have never spent $30 on a brush but am glad I did! You pay for quality.  This brush untangles my hair with ease &amp; in a timely manner.. You&#x27;ll be glad purchased it as much as me.</li>
    <li> Not sure if this is an animal brush or a wig brush or what but it&#x27;s one of the few brushes I&#x27;ve found that can actually brush my hair--I&#x27;ve got lots of thick hair.  My old brush (same kind) is now losing it&#x27;s teeth so needs replacing.  I prefer these metal teeth in wood because they don&#x27;t create any more static.  Good item.</li>
    <li> Nicely made brush that my wife really enjoys using. It&#x27;s been a daily user for about a year and looks like you could sell it as brand new. The metal teeth are in great shape and all of the balls have stayed on because of the way the brush is constructed. Not sure if it is good to use with a hair dryer because of how the metal would heat, so be cautious of that is what you plan to do.</li>
    <li> Beautiful brush.  Almost so nice to don&#x27;t want to use it.  And when the head falls out after a few uses it will remain that, display item only.</li>
    <li> I first purchased \\&quot;Acca Kappa Professional Pro Pneumatic Hair Brush, Oval, Chrome Pins\\&quot; (the one with the white cushion) which is titled on the handle \\&quot;359 Acca Kappa Pneumatic\\&quot;.  I really like the feel of it - it seems like a quality product that would last quite a long time.  But four and a half months later, the barbs on the ends of the metal tines started to break off leaving it rather painful to brush with - besides constantly catching in my hair.  (My hair is straight, below shoulder length, medium-weight.)  I&#x27;m curious to know if this is a usual problem with this brush. I&#x27;m curious if this is a problem others have had with that brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was refunded for the brush, and eventually decided to try \\&quot;Acca Kappa Professional Pro Pneumatic Hair Brush, Oval with Chrome Plated Pins\\&quot; (the one with the black cushion) which is titled on the handle \\&quot;353 Professional Acca Kappa Antistatic\\&quot;.  It also is a quality product; the handle, etc. seems the same.  It has comfortable metal tines that do not catch the hair because they&#x27;re rounded on the ends.  There&#x27;s no separate barb to break off; they appear to be molded into the tines themselves.  The center cushion appears to be the same as the first brush only in a different color, and there&#x27;s a pretty metal trim around the cushion.  I&#x27;m extremely happy with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both brushes say \\&quot;Made in Italy.\\&quot; The handles are 3.5\\&quot; long, the total brush length 8.5\\&quot; long and 2.5\\&quot; wide at the widest part.  (Not sure why another reviewer thought this was a travel size; seems plenty big to me.)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been in search for a brush that will last. For years, I&#x27;ve been buying Chi brushes but, they were only lasting me for about 2 years, max. I was finding on other brushes, the little balls on the end would fall off and the middle pad would eventually crack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this brush for about 6 months now. ALL the balls are still there, and they don&#x27;t look like they&#x27;re coming off anytime soon. I have long hair and this brush brushes well.. comfortable and nice paddle. I love it. Worth the extra money for a quality product</li>
    <li> OK, so I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve spent $35+ for a hair brush before, but this one is truly worth it!  My daughter and I both have long hair and I purchased this as a stocking stuffer for her at Christmas.  The vent brushes just do not work with her fine hair, and other paddle brushes end up falling apart with use or scratching the scalp when the ends of the tines start to break or fall off.  However, this brush has the metal frame around the padded business-end of the brush.  The metal tines are very well made and very smooth -- so no pulling and fraying and splitting of hair when you&#x27;re brusing or styling.  Can&#x27;t say enough good things .....other than I&#x27;m ordering a second brush for ME today.</li>
