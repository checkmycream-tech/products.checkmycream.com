      <li>Also great for people with sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Product easy to use.  </li>
      <li>It smoothes large pores and makes skin look bright and fresh.</li>
      <li>I recommend this to any man looking for a smooth face</li>
      <li>He&#x27;s not one of those metrosexual types who has a bathroom full of care products but he does have a few key products that work great: a great shave cream, after shave moisturizer and this amazing product.</li>
      <li>I tried a few other products that are also awesome, but I liked the feel of the Clinique better.</li>
      <li>I need of a good facial scrub.  </li>
      <li>&gt; - Perfect ZERO (or negative 2) for the tube</li>
      <li>The price is high but it works better than anything else we&#x27;ve tried and it lasts, lasts, lasts...</li>

      <li>When the tube cracks, it becomes a real struggle to get just the right amount of the product out.&lt;br /</li>

      <li>He also has very oily skin</li>
      <li>Really?  </li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>So when you squeeze the tube, the content comes on the side, which leads to getting too much of the product, thus wasting it.&lt;br /&gt; -</li>
      <li>He likes to use it before he shaves to get a really close shave.</li>
      <li>The old long skinny tube dispensed easily, just the right amount.</li>
      <li>The menthol really seems to open the pores which then get scrubbed clean by the beads.</li>
      <li>I have use this facial scrub from Clinique for the past 12 years and it has been absolutely great.</li>
      <li>As another reviewer has stated, the price of this product is to high.</li>
      <li>I cannot understand why Amazon would even allow a price so high.</li>
      <li>In fact, I had to put so much pressure on it, it ripped off completely.  </li>
      <li>This new tube shape is clearly a cheaper design versus the original long tube...</li>
      <li>Not a fan of the new packaging though.</li>
      <li>But what were they thinking of when they designed this new &amp;#34;squat&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I use this before I shave with a blade (which I usually only do once a week) and it really helps my face get ready by softening the hairs, and pulling them upright.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s also very sensitive.</li>
      <li>am actually being pretty generous giving them a 2 stars.</li>
      <li>First of all, it&#x27;s hard to open the top.  </li>
      <li>Hard to find a better product.&lt;br /</li>
      <li>that really remove all the gross parts of your skin.</li>
      <li>Definitely make skin smooth and less irritated after shaving.</li>
      <li>The tiny scrubs deep cleans your pores very well.</li>
      <li>Much as I love the product, the delivery mechanism is broken.</li>
      <li>He has a very heavy beard that grows quickly.</li>
      <li>And after the first couple uses, it gets harder and harder to get the face scrub out of the tube.  </li>

    <li> I love this face scrub! The menthol makes it invigorating and wakes you up in the morning! The tiny scrubs deep cleans your pores very well. Does a great job of softening the beard before a shave. Pricey but you get what you pay for. Part of my daily morning routine: Facial cleanser, facial scrub, shave with shaving gel, toner, post-shave soother, M Lotion moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I too have used this face scrub for well over a decade and consider it a personal grooming essential.  But what were they thinking of when they designed this new &amp;#34;squat&amp;#34; tube dispenser?  As others have wisely noted, it&#x27;s practically unusable.  The cap is nearly impossible to open without tearing it off and having a loose cap to deal with.  And the tube itself in it&#x27;s current shape is VERY difficult to hold and squeeze.  And after the first couple uses, it gets harder and harder to get the face scrub out of the tube.  (You&#x27;ll need THREE hands for this.)  A truly great product badly compromised by poorly thought and badly executed packaging.  Clinique, if you&#x27;re listening, please correct this so I can go back to using your product.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> This is a heavy-duty face scrub; it can be quite rough on the face. I wouldn&#x27;t use this more than once a week, but at that level, it&#x27;s a great product. The menthol really seems to open the pores which then get scrubbed clean by the beads. I use this before I shave with a blade (which I usually only do once a week) and it really helps my face get ready by softening the hairs, and pulling them upright. Yes, it&#x27;s a bit pricey, but a bottle should last you quite a while.</li>
    <li> I tried this product a few times and didn&#x27;t notice any difference. Some may disagree but to me it feels like a waste of money.</li>
    <li> As another reviewer has stated, the price of this product is to high. I purchased this at Macy&#x27;s today for $20.</li>
    <li> The product left the skin feeling nice.  Product easy to use.  The tube very handy in shower and is unbreakable.</li>
    <li> My husband loves Clinique Face Scrub! (And I love it too!) He&#x27;s not one of those metrosexual types who has a bathroom full of care products but he does have a few key products that work great: a great shave cream, after shave moisturizer and this amazing product. He has a very heavy beard that grows quickly. He also has very oily skin but it&#x27;s also very sensitive. He likes to use it before he shaves to get a really close shave. We have tried just about every scrub out there and this product we like the best. It cleans and scrubs well without any irritation. The scrubbing beads are just the perfect size and hold up throughout the washing. You only need a very small amount to do the job. The price is high but it works better than anything else we&#x27;ve tried and it lasts, lasts, lasts...a tube lasts him about 12 months so it gives good value. Not a fan of the new packaging though. The old long skinny tube dispensed easily, just the right amount. The newer short,fat tube is hard to open and even harder to squeeze out.</li>
    <li> I need of a good facial scrub.  This product simply works for me.  My 19 year-old son likes it too.</li>
    <li> I have use this facial scrub from Clinique for the past 12 years and it has been absolutely great. I tried a few other products that are also awesome, but I liked the feel of the Clinique better. Unfortunately, they decided to increase their profit margin by raising the price and lowering the quality of tube container. That is not working too well for us the consumers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(See pictures attached)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt; - One of the very best facial scrubs. Hard to find a better product.&lt;br /&gt; - Great fresh feeling after use.&lt;br /&gt; - Perfect 5 stars for scrub.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt; - Within a couple weeks, the tube cracks in the side. So when you squeeze the tube, the content comes on the side, which leads to getting too much of the product, thus wasting it.&lt;br /&gt; - When the tube cracks, it becomes a real struggle to get just the right amount of the product out.&lt;br /&gt; - Perfect ZERO (or negative 2) for the tube container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am actually being pretty generous giving them a 2 stars. I don&#x27;t think they deserve my business anymore and I have found a couple excellent replacements with &amp;#34;Biotherm Homme Facial Exfoliator&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Lab Series Invigorating Face Scrub&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time. The face scrub has a lot of particles (sand?) that really remove all the gross parts of your skin. My face feels refreshed and revitalized after every use. I recommend this to any man looking for a smooth face</li>
    <li> Negative reviews generally catch readers&#x27; attention, so here goes.  Best product out there by far.  The container is the problem and the sole reason for this review.  First of all, it&#x27;s hard to open the top.  In fact, I had to put so much pressure on it, it ripped off completely.  Worse yet, because the product does not flow out like a shave cream, for example, as the supply is dwindling, the only way to get it out, in my experience, is to cut off the very bottom and dip your finger in to get it out.  When finished, I have to clip it shut.  Really?  Clinique, what were your engineers thinking?  Much as I love the product, the delivery mechanism is broken.</li>
    <li> This scrub is the best!</li>
    <li> Really has made a big difference in my skin, looks more even. I like the scent and how my skin feels refreshed after.</li>
    <li> Nice and grainy.  Good exfoliant.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it helps me get a closer shave. There&#x27;s also a bonus factor! It smoothes large pores and makes skin look bright and fresh. I got compliments on my skin after I started using it regularly. I use clinique scruffing lotion and moisturizer after.</li>
    <li> This is price gouging at it&#x27;s finest - you can buy this locally for $20 at any mall.  I cannot understand why Amazon would even allow a price so high.</li>
    <li> Great face scrub to use before shaving. Definitely make skin smooth and less irritated after shaving. Also great for people with sensitive skin</li>
    <li> I agree with other reviewers that the new packaging is a catastrophe, especially for an otherwise excellent scrub which I have been using now for over 20 years. I guess its time to try something else.</li>
    <li> An excellent product but a very POOR package.  This new tube shape is clearly a cheaper design versus the original long tube... It does NOT work... It is inconvenient....  I called Clinique to share my observations and they said they do not have a customer service organization !</li>
