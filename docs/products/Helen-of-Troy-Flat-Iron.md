      <li>I have to say this is one of the best flat irons I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>Would love to have given this product a good review, but Hot Tools needs to change how they manufacture their product.</li>

      <li>Great flat iron.</li>
      <li>at high instead of low, but after I figured that out it has been working wonderfully.</li>
      <li>I was so happy to find this flat iron which was one of the original irons</li>
      <li>Which was great because I don&#x27;t like straightening my hair every single day.</li>
      <li>Also has a nice long cord for easy maneuver!</li>
      <li>I have special needs and can&#x27;t control irons.</li>
      <li>It got real hot quickly, it did not retain any heat.</li>
      <li>and I found that this was able to keep my hair straight for a couple of days.</li>
      <li>Works very well, and I am totally satisfied with my purchase.</li>
      <li>this flat iron i wanted because i used a friends-often and loved it.  </li>
      <li>i love it and for the price you cant get any better for personal use!</li>
      <li>Would use it on the hottest temperature setting and it straightened my hair quickly.</li>
      <li>my hair still unstraightens after awhile, but that could be because my hair is naturally super curly.</li>
      <li>Loyal fan.</li>
      <li>It seems to be discontinued in stores, but luckily I can find it here on Amazon.</li>
      <li>My mom helps me but this iron helps us both straighten my hair quickly</li>
      <li>It does not get very hot.</li>
      <li>This might be a good buy if you don&#x27;t plan on straightening your hair very often, but if you&#x27;re like me and you HAVE to have your hair straight, then perhaps you should look at a flat iron with a better design.</li>
      <li>, you can&#x27;t have my flat iron&amp;#34; I had to order my own.</li>
      <li>very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;it is so worth the money!</li>
      <li>Right after the 30 day guarantee expired, it wouldn&#x27;t turn on or heat up.</li>
      <li>never was right since the day i opened it...</li>
      <li>I have others that are much pricier and this one is by far my favorite.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice and thick to cover more hair at once.</li>
      <li>I originally bought the Helen of Troy flat iron several years ago and LOVED it.</li>
      <li>It gets hot rather quickly, and straightens very well.</li>
      <li>it heats up very fast and straightens my hair</li>
      <li>This was my first straightener years ago, and after trying several more expensive ones, I find that this one still does the job best.</li>
      <li>It Works great for thick hair and it heats up fast!</li>
      <li>i will most likely reorder since I think I just received a  faulty one.</li>
      <li>Then i did some research and realized that it changed names to Hot Tools.</li>
      <li>I have a Hot Tools curling iron also.</li>
      <li>Love the extra width.</li>
      <li>After my latest one breaks, I&#x27;ll be looking at different brands.</li>
      <li>surprising since I usually have no problems with Hot Tools</li>
      <li>Easy and simple.</li>
      <li>I have had several straighteners and none have seemed to be as easy on my hair as this one.  </li>
      <li>very up set...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s reliable, inexpensive, and serves its purpose very well.</li>
      <li>Very dissatisfied with this product.</li>
      <li>wondering why it was so much cheaper than the others.</li>
      <li>This straightener has no problem getting my hair to be stick straight</li>
      <li>and this gets it so straight</li>
      <li>It does a better job than other straighteners that I have tried.</li>
      <li>I Couldn&#x27;t live without this!</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I have very thick curly hair and the hottest temp straightens it really good</li>
      <li>This flat Iron heats up quickly and one pass on each section</li>
      <li>Not the same kind I had previously.  </li>
      <li>The wider bumpers mean you can&#x27;t burn your scalp, which is a big plus for clients, unless they are very good with a flat iron.</li>
      <li>While this flat iron really gets the job done, the design is really clunky and IT PULLS YOUR HAIR!</li>
      <li>I have very naturally curly hair.</li>
      <li>br /&gt;Helen of Troy heats up VERY fast, and work extremely well, straightener large portions of my hair at a time without buring my hair in a faster time.</li>
      <li>but the measurement were clear - works well otherwise</li>
      <li>I have tried chi and this at the same time, but I have to say I love this model of hot tools better than any other flat iron I have ever tired.</li>
      <li>This is a manufacturing defect that needs to be fixed.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t do anything near straighten.</li>
      <li>Upon first use out of the box it barely heated up twenty minutes later on highest setting.</li>
      <li>Hot Tools are very durable products and I look forward to having this flat iron a very long time.</li>
      <li>I only use hot tools flat iron b/c</li>
      <li>Although not the fanciest most expensive iron, this flat iron gets very hot and straightens even the toughest hair.  </li>
      <li>with these 3 small problems, this is still my favorite flat iron.</li>
      <li>you drop it too many times, the case may crack and catch hair in the crack (not dangerous, but a little painful).&lt;br /&gt;3-The wide bumpers won&#x27;t let you get close enough to the scalp for very kinky hair, although you can overcome this by ironing the scalp hair in different direction - up, down, forwards and backwards.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
      <li>I have thick curly/wavy hair and have always had trouble finding a good straightener.</li>
      <li>I used to have a professional flat iron from my sister in law who is a hair stylist.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This was my first straightener years ago, and after trying several more expensive ones, I find that this one still does the job best. It seems to be discontinued in stores, but luckily I can find it here on Amazon. It&#x27;s reliable, inexpensive, and serves its purpose very well.</li>
    <li> I originally bought the Helen of Troy flat iron several years ago and LOVED it. Would use it on the hottest temperature setting and it straightened my hair quickly. It lasted me several, several years until i accidentally damaged it with water. Then i did some research and realized that it changed names to Hot Tools. I purchased another iron from Amazon not too long ago. It was working great at first, then the hinge broke in between the two paddles (screw came out). I kept pushing it back in and it wouldn&#x27;t stay, but kept using it anyway. Then the night of my nephews wedding I used it, and it must have been on it&#x27;s last leg, because it died after i damaged the hell out of my hair. It singed my hair terribly before the wedding. So I decided to purchase another one since I figured it was a faulty iron. I purchased it last November. It has been working great until last night. I was straightening my hair, and mind you I do not straighten my hair everyday-- so it is not getting a whole lot of use-- and the hinge broke again!!! Would love to have given this product a good review, but Hot Tools needs to change how they manufacture their product.</li>
    <li> Love this straightener! I have others that are much pricier and this one is by far my favorite. It doesn&#x27;t pull my hair and I don&#x27;t have to go over the same section a million times.</li>
    <li> My friend has a Helen of Troy Hair straightener and I use it on my hair when I forget to bring my other brand straightener over her house. &lt;br /&gt;Helen of Troy heats up VERY fast, and work extremely well, straightener large portions of my hair at a time without buring my hair in a faster time. It does a better job than other straighteners that I have tried. &lt;br /&gt;The only downfall is that after about two years of use, the striaghtener died. &lt;br /&gt;Also, when you straighten your hair, sometimes pieces of hair get caught in the sides of the gold plates. but its only a strand of hair about every other time I straighten.</li>
    <li> I used to have a professional flat iron from my sister in law who is a hair stylist. When it broke I was devastated that it would be expensive to replace it. This flat Iron heats up quickly and one pass on each section and I am done. My hair is flat and shiny in minutes. I would definitely buy this item again!!</li>
    <li> Not the same kind I had previously.  It does not get very hot. It says it can get to 420 degrees and it doesn&#x27;t.  I can hold my hair after you run the flat iron in it and it does t burn me.  I only use hot tools flat iron b/c I have very thick curly hair and the hottest temp straightens it really good but not this one that I got. Very disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed about this product . cause is being sell by amazon with different names and different prices ,&lt;br /&gt;in a way to confuse customers ..&lt;br /&gt;Hot topics model 1190 price is $23.76&lt;br /&gt;Helen of Troy 1190  price is  $21.00  , this will be my last purchase . very up set...</li>
    <li> I love this iron! It&#x27;s perfect! It gets hot rather quickly, and straightens very well. My best friend wants one now! :)</li>
    <li> Best flat iron I have ever owned. I have thick curly/wavy hair and have always had trouble finding a good straightener. This straightener has no problem getting my hair to be stick straight and I don&#x27;t think I could ever use another after this one!</li>
    <li> Been using this model for over 10 years now. On my 3rd one. I love how many heat settings there are to choose from, as well as the size of metal sheets in the iron. It&#x27;s nice and thick to cover more hair at once. Unlike store bought ones, this works better! This is the same one used in a salon, and I searched online and purchased because of how well it actually straightened my hair. It&#x27;s thicker and hotter than store bought. Loyal fan.</li>
    <li> love this hair iron. it heats up very fast and straightens my hair very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;it is so worth the money!</li>
    <li> You know im a hairdresser and Ive tried all the straighteners and i usually resort back to this one EVERY TIME. i love it and for the price you cant get any better for personal use!</li>
    <li> Item did not heat up enough...surprising since I usually have no problems with Hot Tools....i will most likely reorder since I think I just received a  faulty one.</li>
    <li> Awesome appliance!!! Works very well, and I am totally satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This is the second set I&#x27;ve bought from this company. I also bought one from another dealer and they all have broken in the bend of the flat iron. This is a manufacturing defect that needs to be fixed. I believe it breaks in that area because of the amount of weight it has to support. I keep buying these because they are the only ones thay will staighten my hair like I want it but I WILL NOT be buying th any longer. If you buy these, I recommend keeping them layed on their side (even when on) in order for it to last longer otherwise they will break after about 6_8 months</li>
    <li> It is such a great tool to help make my hair look FABULOUS!</li>
    <li> little on the wide side but the measurement were clear - works well otherwise</li>
    <li> I have had several straighteners and none have seemed to be as easy on my hair as this one.  It heats up quickly, straightens nicely, doesn&#x27;t seem to damage my hair at all, and my hair comes out shiny.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good straightner. it does the job pretty good. my hair still unstraightens after awhile, but that could be because my hair is naturally super curly.</li>
    <li> I have to say this is one of the best flat irons I&#x27;ve ever used. I have very thick wavy hair and I found that this was able to keep my hair straight for a couple of days. Which was great because I don&#x27;t like straightening my hair every single day. Unfortunately I&#x27;m currently on my third one. While this flat iron really gets the job done, the design is really clunky and IT PULLS YOUR HAIR! Plus it starts falling apart after repeated use (which is why i&#x27;m on my third in the past 5 years). This might be a good buy if you don&#x27;t plan on straightening your hair very often, but if you&#x27;re like me and you HAVE to have your hair straight, then perhaps you should look at a flat iron with a better design. After my latest one breaks, I&#x27;ll be looking at different brands.</li>
    <li> It has less heat and it&#x27;s less damaging than the other irons</li>
    <li> Easy and simple. Could use something to store it in since the cord is long. Recommend it for anyone that has to flat iron their hair</li>
    <li> I love it and I couldn&#x27;t be more happier!</li>
    <li> I have been a hairdresser for over 30 years and this is my go-to flat iron. I have purchased over a dozen types of flat irons (including Chi, wet to dry, ceramic and tourmaline) over the years (gotta keep up with the trends!) and I always return to this one (and sell it in my salon). The wider bumpers mean you can&#x27;t burn your scalp, which is a big plus for clients, unless they are very good with a flat iron. The wide size lets you put a gentle curve in your ends, which is hard to do with a thinner iron. I always use it at the highest temperature, which will not burn the hair (unlike the high temperatures on some other irons). The reasons I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 are:&lt;br /&gt;1-There is some sort of coating on the plates, so you have to let the iron heat up for at least 30 minutes before you use it for the first time to burn off the coating and it&#x27;s a little stinky.&lt;br /&gt;2-If you drop it too many times, the case may crack and catch hair in the crack (not dangerous, but a little painful).&lt;br /&gt;3-The wide bumpers won&#x27;t let you get close enough to the scalp for very kinky hair, although you can overcome this by ironing the scalp hair in different direction - up, down, forwards and backwards.&lt;br /&gt;Even with these 3 small problems, this is still my favorite flat iron.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron. Love the extra width. Hot Tools are very durable products and I look forward to having this flat iron a very long time. You cannot beat the quality of the products. I have a Hot Tools curling iron also.</li>
    <li> I have had this flat iron for 13 years and it just broke last month. I have yet to find another brand that actually works on my hair since it is very long, thick and frizzy. I am SO thankful to have found this same one on here because all of the stores that I&#x27;ve been to, don&#x27;t carry them. The wide paddles help to do bigger sections, therefore only taking a few minutes to straighten my whole head.</li>
    <li> Huge disappointment. Thought it was going to be top of the line, but didn&#x27;t straighten well and a bit too large and awkward to handle.</li>
    <li> Right after the 30 day guarantee expired, it wouldn&#x27;t turn on or heat up. Very dissatisfied with this product. Definitely would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> It got real hot quickly, it did not retain any heat. Very soon after achieving the highest heat it became luke warm. It was useless!</li>
    <li> never was right since the day i opened it... this flat iron i wanted because i used a friends-often and loved it.  I have used other flat irons in the past and this was fast, sturdy and didnt fry my hair. However after receiving one as a gift-the flat iron never felt the same as the one that i had used prior.  it never closed properly and just literally came apart in my hands.  It was lighter, more plastic, just junk!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Since i received it as a gift i tried to return it I hit roadblocks everywhere. Too bad- guess you get what you pay for..wondering why it was so much cheaper than the others.</li>
    <li> The best straightener I have ever used. I have loads of thick hair and this did the trick. It even stays all day. I&#x27;m very impressed.</li>
    <li> I went home for the holidays and my mom had this... after being told, &amp;#34;No, you can&#x27;t have my flat iron&amp;#34; I had to order my own.</li>
    <li> A great iron for straightening hair. Mine is a kinky, frizzy, curly mess and this gets it so straight, it shines. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> for the price, the heat you get is just amazing. I have tried chi and this at the same time, but I have to say I love this model of hot tools better than any other flat iron I have ever tired.</li>
    <li> In love with it!! I had it before when I was 15 now I&#x27;m 25 and I absolutely love it</li>
    <li> I have very naturally curly hair. I have special needs and can&#x27;t control irons. I am learning with this one. My mom helps me but this iron helps us both straighten my hair quickly so I can go to my job. My mom loves it and I do to.</li>
    <li> Although not the fanciest most expensive iron, this flat iron gets very hot and straightens even the toughest hair.  The wide plates makes straightening longer hair quicker.</li>
    <li> Ordered at the end of March and it burnt out just yesterday (7/14/2014). It didn&#x27;t even last 6 months and I can&#x27;t return it or have it replaced.</li>
    <li> My favorite hair straightener!  The only con: if it has a crack in it...it will yank out your hair..ouch!</li>
    <li> came on time and works amazing!</li>
    <li> Terrible! Doesn&#x27;t do anything near straighten. Just pull n frizzes.</li>
    <li> It didnt work! Upon first use out of the box it barely heated up twenty minutes later on highest setting. Ugh.</li>
    <li> I Couldn&#x27;t live without this! It Works great for thick hair and it heats up fast! Also has a nice long cord for easy maneuver!</li>
    <li> Straightest electric flat iron out there.  I am African&#x3D;American and went relaxer free four years ago.  I was using a CHI which worked fine on my relaxed hair but was not successful on my natural hair.  I was so happy to find this flat iron which was one of the original irons I began using 20 years.  My advice to Helen of Troy.  If it&#x27;s working no moderinzation is needed.  I wish this one was more available</li>
    <li> All of my hair irons are Helen of Troy. I buy them for my daughters too. They are the best.</li>
    <li> The temperature control feature is a gem.  I made a mistake in the beginning and did not realize I had the control&lt;br /&gt;set at high instead of low, but after I figured that out it has been working wonderfully.</li>
