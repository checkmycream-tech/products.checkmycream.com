    <li> My daughter loved this variety of colors.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping!  I handed these out as shower favors at my sister in law&#x27;s bridal shower. The names are wedding themed and the colors are great, especially the pinks. I have not painted my nails with the product yet so I can&#x27;t review durability and finish. I think the guests were happy.</li>
    <li> GAVE AS A BLEATED WEDDING GIFT- SHE LOVED IT!</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I am searching for the color I will wear on my wedding day, I have tried two of the colors, &amp;#34;Got Engaged&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Love every minute&amp;#34;, both are beautiful, next I will try &amp;#34;She said yes&amp;#34;, I can&#x27;t wait!  Beautiful collection, you do not have to be getting married to enjoy this collection!</li>
    <li> Pretty colors, but so streaky and goopy. So dissapointed...</li>
    <li> These did not cover well. After 3 coats nails still looked bad. It also chipped like crazy. It&#x27;s a cute set, but worthless.</li>
    <li> So glad I bought this I read the review that said the box it came in was ruined.. Not mine it came perfectly intact very cute can&#x27;t wait to give as gift!</li>
    <li> I really like these nail polishes but the only con is that you have todo alot of coats if you want it to be opaquue. I did my nails the other day and i did about 4 coats. And i dont know if it was the top coat i used or what but one finger chiped and i had to redo my nails a different color.</li>
    <li> Perfect for a wedding</li>
    <li> Perfect sample of four different colors for a fantastic price!</li>
    <li> fast shipment, nice color</li>
    <li> Love the colors and color names - excited to give these away as shower gifts soon!  Wish other wedding-themed color cubes were available as well!</li>
    <li> I love Essie nail products but was disappointed with this shipment. Normally things come in good or better condition. This container was not kept; was wrinkled, broken, and crushed from shipment. I was hoping to use these as gifts but not if they&#x27;re going to come like this. If you want it just for the nail polish- you&#x27;re good.</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors. The mini bottles are actually a perfect size and makes it so you don&#x27;t have to worry about the polish going bad if you don&#x27;t use them.</li>
    <li> I love all Essie products and this is no exception. Great value for a 4 pack of colors and i brought it along on my wedding day so my party could glam up for the big event. My mom used the blue which she loved. Very subtle powder blue color with just a touch of pearl to it. Another winner from Essie. These are great for spring too.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite polish.  I love to buy polish in the mini/sample sizes so that I can decide if I like it enough to buy a full bottle........that way I don&#x27;t end up with tons of large polish bottles that I will never use!!!\&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set however, is great, all of the polishes are beautiful.  I am not normally a &amp;#34;peach&amp;#34; person, but I love the combo of these two. Great SET</li>
