      <li>Its not scratchy and doesn&#x27;t chip off like most glitter polishes.</li>

      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>insted of pretty bottles</li>
      <li>And the colors are vibrant!</li>
      <li>Thanks again.</li>
      <li>I have very poor lighting in my living room, but I could see the shimmer from this glitter as if it was very bright in here.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I recommend opening over a piece of paper because just a turn of the lid despences enough glitter for makeup purposes and a quarter turn is more than enough for nails.</li>
      <li>Cool little bottles.</li>
      <li>The lid is not tight enough and it keeps on splitting.</li>

<li> The only thing that I don&#x27;t like about the glitters is that the cap on the containers get loose</li>
<li> I have tried numerous other glitters that simply were not up to par.</li>
<li> the salons are too expensive and not too clean.</li>
<li> The glitter gets everywhere and you loose a lot of product each time you take the cap off one of the bottles.</li>
<li> I had them in ziplock baggies and told her to be Very Careful since  the containers were glass.  </li>
<li> Some of the colors are just odd hues.  </li>
<li> I like the little glass viles they come in too.</li>
<li> i got little plastic containers.</li>
<li> it wastes a lot.</li>
<li> However the Dust Bottles are just not good for holding this product in them.</li>
<li> of the vials was broken when I received my order, which I didn&#x27;t even notice because they were wrapped in plastic, and then wrapped in bubble wrap.</li>

    <li> The colors you see in the pic arent what you recieve from this order. Unfortunetly i wish i would have saved my 10$</li>
    <li> Good for the price.  Out of the 12 colors, I think I&#x27;d only use  five of them.  Some of the colors are just odd hues.  Works fine for nail art and is great when you mix the colors to create you own &amp;#34;franken-glitter&amp;#34; look.</li>
    <li> Love my 12 pc glitter. I do my own manicures...the salons are too expensive and not too clean. I am a clean freak. So I do my own.&lt;br /&gt;All the colors are beautiful. I do my mom&#x27;s manicure also. She loves to have two fingers with glitter. Thats all we do 2 fingers.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> These were mailed to me from China, but I was not in a hurry to get them.  The colors are beautiful and I will enjoy using these pretty colors this summer.</li>
    <li> The lid is not tight enough and it keeps on splitting. But the colors are nice so I rated 2</li>
    <li> Came well packaged with almost no glitter when I opened the box it was shipped in or the box they come in. Terrific vibrant colors in a small sized glitter, larger than powdered and smaller than craft. I recommend opening over a piece of paper because just a turn of the lid despences enough glitter for makeup purposes and a quarter turn is more than enough for nails. The jars are adorable with nice tight screw-on lids. I&#x27;m in love with all of the things I can do with this glitter!!</li>
    <li> Definitely worth the value. Just like described. Great for nail art can apply on gel polish, in acrylic powders or gel overlays. Works awesome in them all. Beautiful colors. Cool little bottles.</li>
    <li> Good glitter but it did not come in as big a container as it is pictured.  insted of pretty bottles i got little plastic containers.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this purchase. I have very poor lighting in my living room, but I could see the shimmer from this glitter as if it was very bright in here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the vials was broken when I received my order, which I didn&#x27;t even notice because they were wrapped in plastic, and then wrapped in bubble wrap. So, when I opened the plastic the bottom fell out of the bottle and the glitter went all in my hand, and on my clothes. Luckily, because it went in my hand, I was able to salvage almost the whole bottle. I made the company aware, and they promptly wrote back to me, and were very courteous. Because it wasn&#x27;t their fault, it was damaged in transit and I believe they truly did try to prevent it from happening, I did not ask for compensation, or a return, or anything. I have no doubt they would have gladly given me one had I asked, but I didn&#x27;t see the need since I was able to save the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. I will definitely be ordering from them again, and the glitter exceeded my expectations. Truly, the photo they have does not do it justice. It&#x27;s just beautiful. Thanks again.</li>
    <li> I got these and was amazed at the amount of glitter in each one of the vials!  there is quite a bit more than it appears in the photo!</li>
    <li> was very happy with the product it just took a little long to receive but product was great for price</li>
    <li> I have tried numerous other glitters that simply were not up to par. Honestly, this was my last attempt at buying glitter before I gave up on trying to use glitter for my nails. The package arrived in great condition. When I used them for my acrylic nails, everything came together perfectly! And the colors are vibrant! Love them!</li>
    <li> This glitter works great! nice colors and lids stay shut.  I would suggest the manufacturer put them in wider containers so that you can dip your nail into in instead of pouring it out onto the nail.  it wastes a lot.</li>
    <li> This arrived with glitter oozing out of the package.  One of the glass bottles had shattered and Everything was covered in Red Glitter!&lt;br /&gt;When I gave it to my granddaughter I had them in ziplock baggies and told her to be Very Careful since  the containers were glass.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this item.</li>
    <li> Hey you can  mix the colors and these look good on your chest area.</li>
    <li> The nail powders are fine enough to make it worth while! Its not scratchy and doesn&#x27;t chip off like most glitter polishes.</li>
    <li> Great product! Great value! So meny colors. I like the little glass viles they come in too. It&#x27;s definately a steal of a deal.</li>
    <li> Again, these were requested by my daughter-in-law who does nails for friends, etc.  She does all kinds of designs and loves the items that helps her personalize her work.</li>
    <li> So happy I ordered this product. I will re-order with no problems. The colors provided are wonderful. This is great for everyday use or party.</li>
    <li> Said it wouldn&#x27;t arrive until after Xmas, but I received within 1 1/2 weeks. Everything was in one piece.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I started to do acrylic nails and I wanted to get some really cute colors of glitter so I ordered this and when I came I was stunned !! The colors are really beautiful, they are even better on nails!! The only thing that I don&#x27;t like about the glitters is that the cap on the containers get loose so sometimes the glitter falls out but other then that I love it!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this to put on my nails as I do manicure specialities.  You can also ues on craft projects.. Great price fo all this glitter</li>
    <li> I love the glitter you get, it is so beautiful. However the Dust Bottles are just not good for holding this product in them. The glitter gets everywhere and you loose a lot of product each time you take the cap off one of the bottles. I had to put my glitter in another container. The bottles are good for holding other nail art , just not glitter.</li>
