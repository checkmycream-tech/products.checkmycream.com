      <li>The brush is awesome and soft!, it blends super nice.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sixty and feel better when I wear makeup, more polished.  </li>
      <li>, I love that it&#x27;s ecofriendly.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why there aren&#x27;t more eye brushes</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really more like a multi-purpose eye brush to me.</li>
      <li>Also the lil package it comes in is cute af.</li>
      <li>I go through so many brushes - some of better quality than others.</li>
      <li>I guess it&#x27;s okay</li>
      <li>and I fell in love with this brush as soon as I saw/</li>
      <li>I love this brush</li>
      <li>Decent price, works great (soft yet able to pick up good amount of product)...</li>
      <li>So soft, love these brushes!!</li>
      <li>It easily slides eye shadow on.</li>
      <li>This would be a great brush but for the fact that it&#x27;s crooked.</li>
      <li>It is a good size and is fairly soft.  </li>
      <li>For the price and knowing it is environmentally friendly, it works for me.</li>
      <li>It is very soft and well-made, and it applies eye shadow evenly and nicely.</li>
      <li>I use it for if I have to much eyeshadow on and want to blend at the top.</li>
      <li>I think everyone should have at least two of these brushes forget all the rest of the blending brushes this is the best one out there!</li>
      <li>I bought two for travel but they&#x27;re actually fatter and heavier than my regular Mac shadow brush so at best</li>
      <li>Eco Tools brushes are my favorite brushes, and I pretty much recommend all of their brushes.</li>
      <li>Shipping was super fast</li>
      <li>Good little eyeshadow brush.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>And like all Eco Tools brushes, this one is super soft and made very very well.</li>
      <li>The bristles are uneven at the very top</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t lose hairs, the short handle makes it easy to manipulate, and I think it applies eyeshadow</li>
      <li>I use it more to blend since it doesn&#x27;t really hold shadow well, perhaps brushes like these need to used with loose shadows instead of cakes.  </li>
      <li>It is slightly flat, so if you hold it horizontally you can apply easily to the corners and crannies of your eye lids.</li>
      <li>I really like the product, packaging, and the company&#x27;s whole mind-set &amp; aesthetic...</li>
      <li>I highly recommend!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a shame too because I really like the softness of the bristles.</li>
      <li>Thanks Eco Tools.</li>
      <li>This is a nice, firm brush and I like the shape.  </li>
      <li>ok so I love this brush..not to expensive but has all the qualities of your higher end brand brush..</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Brushes are of high quality.  </li>
      <li>Very soft bristles, and is the perfect size to cover my entire eyelid with one fail swoop.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure what the advantage of a more expensive brush would be, though I&#x27;m sure people who are more knowledgeable can tell a difference.</li>
      <li>Overall, I think it works pretty well.</li>
      <li>I have not experienced any \\&quot;shedding\\&quot; of the soft hairs, and I am just very pleased with this purchase.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s soooo soft and does not shed at all.</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t buy from this company because I don&#x27;t want to deal with returning something that isn&#x27;t worth paying the extra shipping fees to send it back.</li>
      <li>However, I thought this brush was small but in the reality it was more bigger than I was expecting, and for my eyelid</li>
      <li>they&#x27;ll be used rarely for dark accent shadows on lids.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a pretty small, thick and hard brush which for shadow isn&#x27;t ideal.</li>
      <li>A longer softer brush distributes the shadow more evenly while this leaves a dark swath and doesn&#x27;t blend well since it pulls at the delicate skin.</li>

    <li> This brush has very soft bristles and works to distribute eye shadow wonderfully. It is slightly flat, so if you hold it horizontally you can apply easily to the corners and crannies of your eye lids. I have not experienced any \\&quot;shedding\\&quot; of the soft hairs, and I am just very pleased with this purchase. I really like the product, packaging, and the company&#x27;s whole mind-set &amp; aesthetic...I think my next purchase will be their 5 pack brush set.</li>
    <li> Decent price, works great (soft yet able to pick up good amount of product)...yay EcoTools!</li>
    <li> ok so I love this brush..not to expensive but has all the qualities of your higher end brand brush..if not better...does not shead or bleed!!..also if you are thinking about getting a set because it might be cheaper I want to let you know this identical brush does not come in any set..the ones in the sets are NOT the same..they are harder and less dense..I recommend getting the sets (I have them all) but you must also buy this one on the side as well.  Hope this helped you</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a love &amp; hate relationship with it. The brush is awesome and soft!, it blends super nice.However, I thought this brush was small but in the reality it was more bigger than I was expecting, and for my eyelid it&#x27;s too big &#x3D;(. But I&#x27;m gonna use it anyway</li>
    <li> Shipping was super fast and I fell in love with this brush as soon as I saw/felt it. It&#x27;s soooo soft and does not shed at all. Also the lil package it comes in is cute af. Would recommend. 11/10</li>
    <li> I love this brush it&#x27;s soft and smooth. I use it for if I have to much eyeshadow on and want to blend at the top. I also start using it for blending in my concealer when I line up my eyebrows. I think everyone should have at least two of these brushes forget all the rest of the blending brushes this is the best one out there! Thanks Eco Tools.</li>
    <li> I use this brush every day for applying my brow highlight. I don&#x27;t know why they call it an eye shading brush, because it&#x27;s really not ideal for shading, but I guess you could if you wanted to. It&#x27;s really more like a multi-purpose eye brush to me. And like all Eco Tools brushes, this one is super soft and made very very well. Eco Tools brushes are my favorite brushes, and I pretty much recommend all of their brushes.</li>
    <li> Great brush for price, doesn&#x27;t shed, well made.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush! I use mine to distribute Laura Mercier secret brightening powder under my eyes after I have applied a concealer. For the price and knowing it is environmentally friendly, it works for me.</li>
    <li> Perfect..Love this item</li>
    <li> Good little eyeshadow brush.  I use it more to blend since it doesn&#x27;t really hold shadow well, perhaps brushes like these need to used with loose shadows instead of cakes.  Otherwise good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I love that it&#x27;s ecofriendly.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work with my eye shadow.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sixty and feel better when I wear makeup, more polished.  My skin, as we all do, is losing elasticity, so any tugging or pulling is not advisable.  This brush tenderly applies makeup without any stress to the skin.  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why there aren&#x27;t more eye brushes this size out there, but there aren&#x27;t.  This is a great brush- just like all the EcoTools.  It&#x27;s big enough for maximum coverage and blending ability.  The bristles don&#x27;t fray or fall out.  It&#x27;s a steal for the money.</li>
    <li> This would be a great brush but for the fact that it&#x27;s crooked. The bristles are uneven at the very top so I can&#x27;t put the eye shadow on evenly. It&#x27;s a shame too because I really like the softness of the bristles. I think I&#x27;ll try to cut it a little to try and even it out. It wouldn&#x27;t hurt. It&#x27;s not worth sending it back. I won&#x27;t buy from this company because I don&#x27;t want to deal with returning something that isn&#x27;t worth paying the extra shipping fees to send it back.</li>
    <li> This is a very functional, comfortable product that is a great value too! It easily slides eye shadow on. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Great makeup brush! I&#x27;ve been using it for weeks and not one hair has fallen out.</li>
    <li> Very soft bristles, and is the perfect size to cover my entire eyelid with one fail swoop. I really love the EcoTools brand, always a good product.</li>
    <li> So soft, love these brushes!!</li>
    <li> I go through so many brushes - some of better quality than others. This one falls into the &amp;#34;gets the job done but nothing special&amp;#34; category.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush daily for almost a month and I don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about it. It doesn&#x27;t lose hairs, the short handle makes it easy to manipulate, and I think it applies eyeshadow well. I&#x27;m not sure what the advantage of a more expensive brush would be, though I&#x27;m sure people who are more knowledgeable can tell a difference.</li>
    <li> This brush works great.  It is a good size and is fairly soft.  Overall, I think it works pretty well.</li>
    <li> This is a nice, firm brush and I like the shape.  Good price for good quality</li>
    <li> This is a great brush. It is very soft and well-made, and it applies eye shadow evenly and nicely.</li>
    <li> Love ECO tools! I have used this tool for several years and have never been disappointed</li>
    <li> I guess I should have seen from the photo it&#x27;s a pretty small, thick and hard brush which for shadow isn&#x27;t ideal. A longer softer brush distributes the shadow more evenly while this leaves a dark swath and doesn&#x27;t blend well since it pulls at the delicate skin. I bought two for travel but they&#x27;re actually fatter and heavier than my regular Mac shadow brush so at best they&#x27;ll be used rarely for dark accent shadows on lids.</li>
    <li> I guess it&#x27;s okay but it could be a bit smaller and the brush longer. And it&#x27;s bit expensive. I&#x27;m still lookin for a blogger one</li>
    <li> Brushes are of high quality.  I have purchased additional sizes for different uses from this brand.</li>
