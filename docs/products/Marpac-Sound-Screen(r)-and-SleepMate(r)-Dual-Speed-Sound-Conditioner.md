      <li>On the lower setting, it is the perfect pitch for a wonderful night sleep.</li>
      <li>I could not let the conductors get the best of me.  </li>
      <li>I am very happy with this machine.  </li>
      <li>Very happy!</li>
      <li>They are awesome.</li>
      <li>but after that it was great!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for hotels!</li>
      <li>it is the perfect solution.</li>
      <li>GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
      <li>Marpac is a great company who makes a great product and it was delivered in a timely manner.</li>
      <li>I got hooked on one of these while watching my grandson who woke up real easy.  </li>
      <li>The Marpac came in very handy... slept like a baby.  :)</li>
      <li>It will fit into just about any traveling case or container and that&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>so it will not scratch nice furniture</li>
      <li>I also liked that it has foam padding on the bottom</li>
      <li>I liked it so much I bought another one, and they both are great.  </li>
      <li>This unit was ordered to replace one that I have used for many years.</li>
      <li>We take ours on trips and love it in our hotel room or even when visiting relatives.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I made the purchase</li>
      <li>LOVE THE NOISE AT NIGHT, MADE SLEEPING</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Marpac Sound Conditioner for 3-4 weeks now---I haven&#x27;t had to sleep in another bedroom since then!</li>
      <li>Extremely pleased with Amazon and seller service.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>This machine eliminates the &#x27;wind&#x27; of the fan but gives the perfect white noise.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure the size and weight is listed somewhere on the page</li>
      <li>It works great, no problems, and has nice adjustments for how loud you want the sound.  </li>
      <li>I found this sound conditioner to be more of a hindrance than help.</li>
      <li>I tried this sound machine, and absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>I will say that the first week of the sound machine for my oldest boy was not so good.  </li>
      <li>All in all, the product does a fine job.</li>
      <li>I am a light sleeper and my husband snores...</li>
      <li>Simple and work great.</li>
      <li>BLOCKS ANY SOUND</li>
      <li>The sound is adjustable.  </li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t sleep well with it on because the sound was distracting.</li>
      <li>The quality of the white noise is great.</li>
      <li>My husband has a health issue with the use of a fan - this works perfectly as a replacement, plus you can easily pack it up for traveling because it is small.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s taken many vacations with us, and always helps her drift off to sleep peacefully, even when the excitement and novelty of a bed away from home could have kept her hyped up for a while.    </li>
      <li>This is by far the best white noise machine I have encountered.  </li>
      <li>And, in considering this, I can&#x27;t say that my efforts were purely altruistic; I had to suffer through many shivering nights in which she had to have a fan on to get her night&#x27;s rest.</li>
      <li>Yes, the reviews were true...</li>
      <li>I tell all new parents that the Marpac is the best $50 I ever spent.  </li>
      <li>, I love it and would highly recommend the product.</li>
      <li>This sound screen is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>but then reported back a couple weeks later and loves it now... said first night wasn&#x27;t helpful, but got better and now its great.</li>
      <li>It creates the same sort of sound the air filter or a fan creates - the dial allows you to adjust how loud it is and the type of noise - one way is a mostly rushing air noise, the other is more of a pleasant mechanical hum.</li>
      <li>Thank you, Sleep Mate, for keeping it simple and effective.</li>
      <li>This is a great product and is the second one we purchased, as we gave the first one to our son who was in an Army barracks and found it very loud.</li>
      <li>And of course, as usual, it&#x27;s a great deal here on Amazaon.</li>
      <li>I know exactly what is happening out there...</li>
      <li>I bought it for my girlfriend who has unfortunately developed a sort of addiction to sound makers in order to sleep.</li>
      <li>I love this white noise machine.  </li>
      <li>BUT STILL WOULD BE ABLE TO HEAR ANYTHING NECESSARY.</li>
      <li>There is also a toggled on and off switch which allows you to set it on 1, a very quiet, softer setting, and 2, a more pronounced but still non-obtrusive setting.         </li>
      <li>Overall, I love this machine.</li>
      <li>Before long, I realized I might be able to persuade her to get something like a rain noisemaker etc.</li>
      <li>I live about 1/3 of a mile from a railroad track, and by the loudness of the horn I could swear the train is running right through my front yard.  </li>
      <li>You can spin the top portion to allow less air in/out which appears to affect the sound levels, while the side/vertical portion of it, which spins in the same way a professional camera lens rotates, allows you to adjust the sound charactersitic itself.</li>
      <li>sound screen is a lot softer volume wise than something like my air filter, when I first turned it on my husband remarked &#x27;Is that as loud as it gets?&#x27;, however, while my air filter sits on the other side of the room, far away, I put the marpac next to me on my nightstand</li>
      <li>SO MUCH EASIER.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take up much space.</li>
      <li>It does the job very well.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what it is, but it entirely drowns out the sound of the horn, not to mention the laughing and clinking glasses of the conductors.  </li>
      <li>She and I prefer the wide open, and most pronounced sound position.</li>
      <li>The Marpac is very portable</li>
      <li>I thought maybe it needed to warm up for first-time use, but after a few minutes it shut itself off.  </li>
      <li>We live in a very small flat where sound carries - the Marpac drowns out most noise making it easy to fall asleep.  </li>
      <li>I waited way too long to get a sound machine for my son, now 2, for during his naps.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still pretty loud.  </li>
      <li>My girlfriend and I both commented on it the first night we slept with it on, stating just how quiet it appears to be at first</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t sleep well without it, highly reccomend it.</li>
      <li>The sound the marpac makes is much like a fan; it whirs quietly but substantial enough to somehow fill the room with a windy whitenoise.</li>
      <li>The only issue I&#x27;ve had with it (which isn&#x27;t even an issue really) is that it&#x27;s not \\&quot;pure white\\&quot; as some sites state, but rather a creamy off-white.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to note that the first picture in this listing is NOT of the 980A, it must be a slightly older model, the switch is different, the second picture is correct.</li>
      <li>My husband is a loud snorer.  </li>
      <li>We tried some of the brands you see in retail outlets and the quality here far surpasses those products.</li>
      <li>Electronic white noise equivilents all sound very electronic to me and I can usually hear the point of repetition, which bothers me and keeps me</li>
      <li>You would think that with two speeds and two other up/down adjustments, you&#x27;d be able to turn the volume down quite low, but you can&#x27;t really.</li>
      <li>Since the birth of my second son, I absolutely had to have one since their bedrooms are right next to each other, and the baby would wake up my 2 year old in the night.  </li>
      <li>He woke up earlier than normal from his naps, and it was because he needed to get used to the machine.  </li>
      <li>As soon as I received this product, it made nothing more than a weak whirring noise.  </li>
      <li>Even the second setting isn&#x27;t too loud.  </li>
      <li>Kinda feels like you&#x27;re in another world while you sleep because outside sounds become so far away and muffled, including our barking dogs,</li>
      <li>our enough to keep you awaken, but is loud enough to be a distraction,  </li>
      <li>I was very skeptical of all the positive reviews when I began my search, especially because I couldn&#x27;t find a single soundbite online to get my own feel for it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It does let off a very very slight airflow out the holes, if I put my hand right over them I can feel it, but not enough to reach my face sleeping next to it and bother</li>
      <li>As she got older, she called it her \\&quot;sleep machine\\&quot; and won&#x27;t lie down in her bed without it turned on.  </li>

</ol>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> First of all, I&#x27;d like to start out by reminding everyone just how small this thing is. I&#x27;m sure the size and weight is listed somewhere on the page but I never thought anything of it until I opened the package. It&#x27;s a little smaller around than your hand stretched out and a few inches tall. It will fit into just about any traveling case or container and that&#x27;s great. Can you imagine traveling with a fan all the time? Other than a clunky humidifier, a fan is about the closest sounding device I can think of.          The sound the marpac makes is much like a fan; it whirs quietly but substantial enough to somehow fill the room with a windy whitenoise. My girlfriend and I both commented on it the first night we slept with it on, stating just how quiet it appears to be at first but how it somehow fills all the empty space in the room swallowing up your anxiety-ridden, restless thoughts.  There is a small amount of adjustment that comes with the Marpac. You can spin the top portion to allow less air in/out which appears to affect the sound levels, while the side/vertical portion of it, which spins in the same way a professional camera lens rotates, allows you to adjust the sound charactersitic itself. She and I prefer the wide open, and most pronounced sound position. There is also a toggled on and off switch which allows you to set it on 1, a very quiet, softer setting, and 2, a more pronounced but still non-obtrusive setting.         I was very skeptical of all the positive reviews when I began my search, especially because I couldn&#x27;t find a single soundbite online to get my own feel for it. I took the plunge based on hundreds of reviews I read online and I&#x27;m glad I did. I bought it for my girlfriend who has unfortunately developed a sort of addiction to sound makers in order to sleep. And, in considering this, I can&#x27;t say that my efforts were purely altruistic; I had to suffer through many shivering nights in which she had to have a fan on to get her night&#x27;s rest. Before long, I realized I might be able to persuade her to get something like a rain noisemaker etc. So in my quest for warmer nights, I ran into the Marpac SleepMate.         All in all, the product does a fine job. The only issue I&#x27;ve had with it (which isn&#x27;t even an issue really) is that it&#x27;s not \\&quot;pure white\\&quot; as some sites state, but rather a creamy off-white. I&#x27;m glad I made the purchase and so is my girlfriend. And of course, as usual, it&#x27;s a great deal here on Amazaon. Give it shot!</li>
    <li> This sound screen is exactly what I was looking for. I have trouble sleeping at night and in order to block out those night sounds I have been using a Honeywell HEPA filter on high all night long for the last 3-4 years. The problem is the HEPA filter is moving a lot of air and draws roughly 250 Watts of electricity, which is a lot to be running 12+ hours a day, ever day of the year. Also its not very feasible for me to take it with me traveling, which makes it hard to sleep on the road. Electronic white noise equivilents all sound very electronic to me and I can usually hear the point of repetition, which bothers me and keeps me awake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I asked for and received the Marpac 980A for christmas - it is the perfect solution. It draws a lot less electricity, which was something I was looking for. It creates the same sort of sound the air filter or a fan creates - the dial allows you to adjust how loud it is and the type of noise - one way is a mostly rushing air noise, the other is more of a pleasant mechanical hum. It also has two settings on the on/off switch, low and high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sound screen is a lot softer volume wise than something like my air filter, when I first turned it on my husband remarked &#x27;Is that as loud as it gets?&#x27;, however, while my air filter sits on the other side of the room, far away, I put the marpac next to me on my nightstand and it actually seems about the same volume at that proximity. It&#x27;s small size (about 4.5\\&quot; diameter) means I can take it with me when travelling. I also liked that it has foam padding on the bottom so it will not scratch nice furniture it is set on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does let off a very very slight airflow out the holes, if I put my hand right over them I can feel it, but not enough to reach my face sleeping next to it and bother me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to note that the first picture in this listing is NOT of the 980A, it must be a slightly older model, the switch is different, the second picture is correct.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this machine.  I have been using a box fan to sleep with for about 25 years.  My husband has a health issue with the use of a fan - this works perfectly as a replacement, plus you can easily pack it up for traveling because it is small.  Very happy!</li>
    <li> The sound is adjustable.  It makes a soothing fan noise. It masks other intermittent room noises. It doesn&#x27;t take up much space.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT. ARRIVED AS PROMISED. THEN PURCHASED TRAVEL ONE! LOVE THE NOISE AT NIGHT, MADE SLEEPING SO MUCH EASIER. BLOCKS ANY SOUND OUTSIDE BUT STILL WOULD BE ABLE TO HEAR ANYTHING NECESSARY.</li>
    <li> Over the years I have had to deal with a lot of different ways to sleep.  When I worked night shift I used ear plugs, and when my children were babies I had noise machines for them.  This is by far the best white noise machine I have encountered.  There ie no loop to distract and it&#x27;s not l our enough to keep you awaken, but is loud enough to be a distraction,  I bought one for myself and ended up using it iin my daughters&#x27; room, so I&#x27;m back to order another one for me.</li>
    <li> This is the 5th one we have bought over the last few years for all our bedrooms and as gifts. They are awesome. Simple and work great. We recently took a long trip and took one with to use in the hotel rooms.</li>
    <li> We bought this when our daughter was a newborn (she&#x27;s 5 now).  Our pediatrician told us that white-noise machines help fussy newborns sleep by simulating the rush of sounds they heard in utero.  The Marpac worked like a charm.  As she got older, she called it her \\&quot;sleep machine\\&quot; and won&#x27;t lie down in her bed without it turned on.  It helps her get to sleep by calming her down, and stay alseep by masking household noises that would have otherwise startled her awake.  It&#x27;s taken many vacations with us, and always helps her drift off to sleep peacefully, even when the excitement and novelty of a bed away from home could have kept her hyped up for a while.    This machine has been on for at least 12 hours every single night for the last five years and shows no signs of slowing down.  I tell all new parents that the Marpac is the best $50 I ever spent.  Just had another baby and bought one for his room, too.</li>
    <li> I live about 1/3 of a mile from a railroad track, and by the loudness of the horn I could swear the train is running right through my front yard.  I know exactly what is happening out there...the conductors are laughing and giving cheers with their mugs of beer as they pull the cord for the horn the entire way through town.  Well, this could not go on.  I could not let the conductors get the best of me.  I bought the SleepMate, and I&#x27;ve not been awoken in the middle of the night since.  I don&#x27;t know what it is, but it entirely drowns out the sound of the horn, not to mention the laughing and clinking glasses of the conductors.  Thank you, Sleep Mate, for keeping it simple and effective.</li>
    <li> I love this white noise machine.  Before I had this I slept with a fan on every night.  The Marpac is very portable so I can take it with me when I travel. We live in a very small flat where sound carries - the Marpac drowns out most noise making it easy to fall asleep.  We actually have three...one for us and one for each kid.</li>
    <li> I use this machine for ensuring the privacy of my clients conversations in a home office. It does the job very well.</li>
    <li> This unit was ordered to replace one that I have used for many years. It provides just enough background \\&quot;noise\\&quot; to allow me block out other subtle noises that would otherwise wake me up, or keep me awake. Can&#x27;t sleep well without it, highly reccomend it.</li>
    <li> This machine meet all my expectations.  On the lower setting, it is the perfect pitch for a wonderful night sleep. Even the second setting isn&#x27;t too loud.  In the past I had used a small fan for quiet noise and had to turn to wall to keep from getting chilled in winter.  This machine eliminates the &#x27;wind&#x27; of the fan but gives the perfect white noise. Love it.  Extremely pleased with Amazon and seller service.</li>
    <li> My husband is a loud snorer.  I was using a fan to help drown out the noise but it didn&#x27;t work well---in the middle of the night I was still having to go to another bedroom to get some sleep.  I&#x27;ve been using the Marpac Sound Conditioner for 3-4 weeks now---I haven&#x27;t had to sleep in another bedroom since then!</li>
    <li> I usually sleep with a fan to drown out background noise.  This is like listening to a fan.  It&#x27;s great for hotels!</li>
    <li> I waited way too long to get a sound machine for my son, now 2, for during his naps.  I always had to walk around the house quietly as to not disturb him, and when people would come over he would undoubtedly wake up.  Since the birth of my second son, I absolutely had to have one since their bedrooms are right next to each other, and the baby would wake up my 2 year old in the night.  I tried this sound machine, and absolutely love it. It works great, no problems, and has nice adjustments for how loud you want the sound.  I liked it so much I bought another one, and they both are great.  Now both of my boys can be in their rooms at the same time, and they don&#x27;t wake each other up.  I would definitely recommend this product!!    I will say that the first week of the sound machine for my oldest boy was not so good.  He woke up earlier than normal from his naps, and it was because he needed to get used to the machine.  Stick with it, and they will eventually get used to it!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife who has trouble falling asleep &amp; she loves it.  We tried some of the brands you see in retail outlets and the quality here far surpasses those products. Highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> Yes, the reviews were true... the postive ones, I mean! First night I was skeptical... but after that it was great! I can hear my husband snoring sometimes still, but I think not only does he snore less now, but he also is muffled so when I wake up, it is less bothersome so its easier to fall back asleep... versus lying there seething while the only noise in the room is his snoring! Also helps a lot with outdoor noises. Kinda feels like you&#x27;re in another world while you sleep because outside sounds become so far away and muffled, including our barking dogs, although they are not right at our window, so might be different if sounds were closer. My mom bought one after I told her about it and said it didnt work for her... but then reported back a couple weeks later and loves it now... said first night wasn&#x27;t helpful, but got better and now its great. So give it some time!</li>
    <li> Overall, I love this machine. The quality of the white noise is great. I got the two speed model. My only complaint is that, on the lower setting with the adjustments turned down to their lowest levels, the machine is still louder than I&#x27;d like. You would think that with two speeds and two other up/down adjustments, you&#x27;d be able to turn the volume down quite low, but you can&#x27;t really. It&#x27;s still pretty loud.  Other than that, I love it and would highly recommend the product. I just got back from Manhattan where we stayed in a hotel for four days. The Marpac came in very handy... slept like a baby.  :)</li>
    <li> This is a great product and is the second one we purchased, as we gave the first one to our son who was in an Army barracks and found it very loud. This product helped him sleep in that noisy environment. We take ours on trips and love it in our hotel room or even when visiting relatives.  Our counselors at work use this product also, so their clients are not bothered by noise in the hallway. Marpac is a great company who makes a great product and it was delivered in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> As soon as I received this product, it made nothing more than a weak whirring noise.  I thought maybe it needed to warm up for first-time use, but after a few minutes it shut itself off.  Then it would not power on at all.  Obviously, I ended up returning it and I was very disappointed since I was looking forward to using this product daily.  I would have purchased another, however I fear it will be defective as well; quite a shame.</li>
    <li> I got hooked on one of these while watching my grandson who woke up real easy.  I slept in the room with him for a month and wanted one when I returned home. I am a light sleeper and my husband snores...this definitely helps.</li>
    <li> I found this sound conditioner to be more of a hindrance than help. I couldn&#x27;t sleep well with it on because the sound was distracting.It was a total waste of my money.</li>
