      <li>but they are fine after washing them.</li>
      <li>The case fits comfortably in any carry-on and even my hand bag with no problem.  </li>
      <li>THE PROCESS OF UNWRAPPING REVEALS A FABULOUS COLLECTION.  </li>

      <li>, THIS IS A GIFT TO A SPECIAL FRIEND!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;THE COLLECTION SPEAKS TO A QUALITY PRODUCT WITH A CLASSY LOOK AT AN AMAZING PRICE</li>
      <li>I also loved the fact that there was such a variety of brush shapes</li>
      <li>exactly what I was looking for!</li>
      <li>THE RECIPIENT WILL FEEL PRETTY SPECIAL AT EVERY</li>
      <li>Love the fact that everything is complete with this set.  </li>
      <li>Totally worth every penny.</li>
      <li>The angled blush brush is nice, as well as the larger blending brush, and both fan brushes.</li>
      <li>While these are not brushes I reach for regularly, there were a couple that I liked.</li>
      <li>so It was well worth the $1.99.</li>
      <li>They did have a strong smell when I opened them but that went away as soon as they aired out.</li>
      <li>The brushes feel nice, they are soft and work well so far.</li>
      <li>They do smell a bit when first getting them</li>
      <li>Soft and full brushes.</li>
      <li>I got them on promotion earlier in the year to try them out because I received a promotion code, but the are definitely worth full price.</li>
      <li>Whole heartedly recommend.</li>
      <li>Better rhan what I expected.</li>
      <li>It works better than any other fan brush I have tried.</li>
      <li>, I BOUGHT,  A HIGH RATING</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I recommend leaving the case out away from the brushes to air out because there is a strong smell due to the dye used on the brush case.</li>
      <li>They aren&#x27;t very soft, and they shed quite often.</li>
      <li>I will definitely recommend these to anyone interested in make up.</li>
      <li>Powder brushes are SOOO soft!  </li>
      <li>so one would know what they are all meant for because there seem to be a couple near duplicates.</li>
      <li>Knowing the eyes are one of the sensitive areas of the body, there needs to be softer hairs on the makeup brush.</li>
      <li>The brushes are incredibly soft which i truly like there was sjme shedding of the hair</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s not a typical inclusion.</li>
      <li>Only minor shedding after washing the first time.</li>
      <li>I bought this brush set when there was a quick sale a few months ago.</li>
      <li>Very accessible case (not to big and clumsy), brush texture</li>
      <li>I washed them as soon I received them and no visable shedding or major issue.</li>
      <li>The brushes overall are not bad, but they do shed a little while washing.</li>
      <li>The brushes are so soft and I would definitely recommend this to everyone.</li>
      <li>No lines from the foundation brush and the powder brush blends seamless for an air brushed look.</li>
      <li>Am not a fan of the blush brush its not dense enough, its soft but would require several applications to get a definded cheek color.</li>
      <li>They are very light, so its a lil weird cause</li>

    <li> Love the fact that everything is complete with this set.  I no longer have to purchase everything individually, this set saved me a lot of money.  The brushes hold the powder make-up well when applying.  The case fits comfortably in any carry-on and even my hand bag with no problem.  I would def purchase this as a gift for friends. thank again for the Set, I love it</li>
    <li> Most of the brushes are of pretty good quality. A couple of them shed awfully and have yet to stop. I wish they would have come with labels so one would know what they are all meant for because there seem to be a couple near duplicates. They did have a strong smell when I opened them but that went away as soon as they aired out. The Brush roll is pretty nice and it all came in a nice velvet bag. I got it during the sale so It was well worth the $1.99. I wouldn&#x27;t pay as much as they are priced because I feel there are better options for a good price.</li>
    <li> These brushes are very nice! The quality is excellent, especially for the price. The only reason I did not give them 5 stars is because the bag has a slight chemical smell. The brushes do not have the smell.</li>
    <li> I loved these brushes! They came in a very nice brush roll that is handy for travel and storage and I love that it even had a travel pouch as well.  The brushes were super soft and seemed to be of very good quality. My only issue was that a few of the brushes did tend to shed. My favorite brush was the fan brush. It works better than any other fan brush I have tried. I also loved the fact that there was such a variety of brush shapes/sizes to choose from and that they were each individually wrapped and protected.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with the makeup brush! Good quality, fast delivery and exactly what I was looking for! Will recommend this product 100%</li>
    <li> These are really great brushes for the price point. They would make a nice starter kit for someone getting into makeup! While I don&#x27;t have use for some of the brushes, most of them are handy.</li>
    <li> I just received my make up brush set and it really is amazing. The brushes are so soft and I would definitely recommend this to everyone. Totally worth every penny. I absolutely love it.  It has every brush you could ever need. I give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Got these brushes in yesterday and once i opened the chemical smell was really strong but doesnt affect the brushes . The brushes are incredibly soft which i truly like there was sjme shedding of the hair hopefully once i wash thia will go away overall i do recommend these :)</li>
    <li> These brushes are fairly ok, I love the selection, it also has a pretty good case for storage plus an additional bag. I&#x27;ve used these once. I washed them as soon I received them and no visable shedding or major issue. They are very light, so its a lil weird cause I do feel like I have to get use to realising that I do have something in my hands. Am not a fan of the blush brush its not dense enough, its soft but would require several applications to get a definded cheek color. Lovd the brushes tho.</li>
    <li> Lovely set of brushes. They do smell a bit when first getting them but they are fine after washing them. The brushes feel nice, they are soft and work well so far.

    <li> These are actually my favorite brush set, and I kind of horde makeup brushes. I got them on promotion earlier in the year to try them out because I received a promotion code, but the are definitely worth full price. The brushes feel sturdy in my hand and I haven&#x27;t had any brush hairs falling out. I love the roll up bag with magnetic closure. Very nice quality. Also, the fact that this set comes with a fan brush is great. That&#x27;s not a typical inclusion. I would give this set to my friends as gifts. Highly recommend.</li>

    <li> I love how the make up brushes came as a set.  Problems I have with this product, the brushes fall out. I hair on the brushes are too rough! I would not recommend using around the eyes. Knowing the eyes are one of the sensitive areas of the body, there needs to be softer hairs on the makeup brush.</li>
    <li> While these are not brushes I reach for regularly, there were a couple that I liked. The fan brush was soft and good for applying highlight color to my cheekbones and the lip brush worked well too.</li>
