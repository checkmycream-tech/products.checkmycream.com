      <li>Received the product in okay condition.</li>
      <li>My favorite tweezer of all time.</li>
      <li>She says that they don&#x27;t grab as good as the ones with the straight shafts.</li>
      <li>this was a great deal, it gets all the work done, and is very handy in plucking out the small hairs.</li>
      <li>I was expecting these to pull all of my fine hairs.</li>
      <li>The unique shape also makes it easy to see the hairs you&#x27;re about to tweeze without the handle blocking what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
      <li>They feel nice in the hand and grasp hair very well.</li>
      <li>Love love love the color and that it works much better than my last set of tweezers.</li>
      <li>It was so cheap when it came in the mail</li>
      <li>I normally thread my brows or use a razor to clean them up , and I was looking for a good tweezer to help clean up the stray hairs .</li>
      <li>I absolutely fell in love with them, they are so precise and get even the tiniest hairs.</li>
      <li>Based on the reviews I thought that these tweezers would be awesome, but they are so thick that unless you haven&#x27;t plucked your brows EVER</li>
      <li>Not item I was looking for, item description very incomplete, also I would have liked to see more pictures of tweezer from different angles</li>
      <li>maybe it was the rough handling of the carrier but overall great tweezer!</li>
      <li>I bought the same kind 3 years ago.</li>
      <li>I loved them so much I wanted to get the exact same ones.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many, from top name brands to cheap grocery store ones, I have very fine hair that other tweezers wont get, these get it the first time every time, less pain!</li>
      <li>i can see each individual hair and can be very precise using these.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to find a tweezers that does a great job.  </li>
      <li>After trying them again, I went back and ordered two more pairs online.  </li>
      <li>I wish I would have discovered these 20 years ago, when I first started to tweeze my brow line.</li>
      <li>I really like these tweezers!  </li>
      <li>Spend the extra cash to get something that&#x27;s a better quality.</li>
      <li>I am actually going to buy a couple more to keep in all the bathrooms.</li>
      <li>These tweezers work great for long hairs, but don&#x27;t expect them to grab hold of those tiny eyebrows hairs you want to pluck out.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll make this short and simple the wife loved it</li>
      <li>I love the pink color...</li>
      <li>I read the reviews on this and was worried that these tweezers wouldn&#x27;t work for me, but I have absolutely zero problems with them at all.</li>
      <li>I prefer using tweezers that have straight edge tips because that allows a tighter grip on the hair.  </li>
      <li>Since she is a teenager, and really wasn&#x27;t in the mood to elaborate, I just left it at that and bought her a different pair.</li>
      <li>Very different from your traditional tweezers I like them better than mine.</li>
      <li>this is one of those that are right in the middle.</li>
      <li>The Packaging that held the tweezer was slightly opened  but it looked fine</li>
      <li>The tip really grips the hairs, even fine ones, so there&#x27;s less plucking at the same strands over and over.</li>
      <li>The slant and color are awesome but the tip makes them impossible to actually grasp any hair.</li>
      <li>I immediately had a hard time gripping hairs, and I noticed that the gripper ends don&#x27;t line up.</li>
      <li>I am a professional makeup artist.</li>
      <li>They do if they are longer, but I don&#x27;t let my hairs stay long enough to grow that much.</li>
      <li>I was getting really close to going to a laser center to surgically remove the hair so that I would not have to tweeze ever again.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love these tweezers. I bought the same kind 3 years ago. I used them until they were no longer sharp. I looked everywhere to find them. I loved them so much I wanted to get the exact same ones. If you are looking for some good ones try these.</li>
    <li> Based on the reviews I thought that these tweezers would be awesome, but they are so thick that unless you haven&#x27;t plucked your brows EVER there is no way to actually grab the hairs.  The slant and color are awesome but the tip makes them impossible to actually grasp any hair.</li>
    <li> These tweezers work great for long hairs, but don&#x27;t expect them to grab hold of those tiny eyebrows hairs you want to pluck out.  The tweezers have a rounded molded tips.  I prefer using tweezers that have straight edge tips because that allows a tighter grip on the hair.  The angled end is a great idea but instead of using them to do my eyebrows, they are now my preferred tweezers to use when doing crafts.</li>
    <li> These are the perfect tweezers for me. I love the pink color...that&#x27;s actually the reason I bought them! These work just as well as my last pair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a tweezers that does a great job.  These do it for me!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my teenage daughter who wears glasses.  She said it&#x27;s hard to use while wearing glasses.  I don&#x27;t wear glasses so I don&#x27;t quite understand the logistics of plucking your brows while wearing glasses.  Since she is a teenager, and really wasn&#x27;t in the mood to elaborate, I just left it at that and bought her a different pair.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews on this and was worried that these tweezers wouldn&#x27;t work for me, but I have absolutely zero problems with them at all. The grab the hair perfectly, they grip well, I don&#x27;t get breaking of the hairs or slipping. I am actually going to buy a couple more to keep in all the bathrooms.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are amazing.  They grip even the small hairs.  I never have had good luck with tweezing my elbrows.  I always waxed them because I couldn&#x27;t stand tugging on a hair only to have it slip off and not remove the hair so I had to try again.  After a few times my eyes would be watering my brow beet red and the hair still there. I wish I would have discovered these 20 years ago, when I first started to tweeze my brow line. I was getting really close to going to a laser center to surgically remove the hair so that I would not have to tweeze ever again.</li>
    <li> love this tweezer. i can see each individual hair and can be very precise using these. love them. this is my second pair.</li>
    <li> I agree with the review that says you might as well be using your finger.  These are terrible, I can&#x27;t grip anything.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this pair of tweezers for years now and it&#x27;s still my go to tweezer.  It grips my hair perfectly and I don&#x27;t know if my technique has gotten better or if it&#x27;s the tweezers, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much.  Plus it&#x27;s helpful pulling out ingrown hairs which can be a hassle.</li>
    <li> Do not work on the thickest of hairs! I tried this on my eyebrows and all it does is pull doesnt remove the hairs what so ever!!</li>
    <li> This is the worst tweezer, it doesn&#x27;t work and picks up nothing waste of money I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it at all</li>
    <li> Great for picking ingrown hairs from my husbands beard. They don&#x27;t poke his skin and I can still get the hair.</li>
    <li> Received the product in okay condition. The Packaging that held the tweezer was slightly opened  but it looked fine maybe it was the rough handling of the carrier but overall great tweezer! My favorite tweezer of all time. Its precision is great! well done Revlon!</li>
    <li> Love it. Best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
    <li> this very bad snd not good and it product just to offer and big size i think gor machine not human</li>
    <li> These are the best tweezers I have ever purchased! I will never purchase another pair besides these. Absolutely wonderful! Perfect.</li>
    <li> I immediately had a hard time gripping hairs, and I noticed that the gripper ends don&#x27;t line up. I contacted Revlon but received no response. I have since thrown them away. They were a complete waste of money, in my opinion. Maybe they were defective, but the manufacturer should have worked with me. Get some plain ol&#x27; silver ones!</li>
    <li> It was so cheap when it came in the mail i was like yess!!! Finally i can pluck these bushy eyebrows!!! It works like a charm love this</li>
    <li> Terrible waste of money, and took forever to get delivered. Couldn&#x27;t even pick up a long piece of hair. Spend the extra cash to get something that&#x27;s a better quality. Would give it -5 stars if I could.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are great. The angled shape makes it easier to hold and pluck you eyebrows.I also like that there pink!</li>
    <li> These tweezers are wonderful and such a good idea.  They are especially helpful for plucking eyebrows if you wear glasses. Good quality and will work on fine hair and splinters.</li>
    <li> I am a professional makeup artist. This is one of the best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever invested in. The tip really grips the hairs, even fine ones, so there&#x27;s less plucking at the same strands over and over. The unique shape also makes it easy to see the hairs you&#x27;re about to tweeze without the handle blocking what you&#x27;re doing. This is an essential item in my makeup kit and I will purchase another of the same if I ever need to replace my current one.</li>
    <li> I really like these tweezers!  I owned a pair a few years ago, and I was upset lost them.  I was not able to find them in stores around my house.  I was not able to find any that works as well as them since.  I was very pleased when I found these online. After trying them again, I went back and ordered two more pairs online.  Just don&#x27;t want to be without them in case they get discontinued.</li>
    <li> I have tried to find these after purchasing a pair a few years ago.  For those who need to wear glasses to see close up they are terrific.  Made to tweeze around or over them.  I ordered two as my daughter and I fight over them.</li>
    <li> Very different from your traditional tweezers I like them better than mine. Love love love the color and that it works much better than my last set of tweezers.</li>
    <li> The Item works as described, no complaints. They are tweezers, so they do what they are intended to do. 1</li>
    <li> Product exactly as expected. Solid metal used. Great Garvin for the price. Received on time.</li>
    <li> So-so I have had many Revlon products some of their tweezers are made extremely well and some aren&#x27;t this is one of those that are right in the middle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll make this short and simple the wife loved it and it&#x27;s now her must have on hand/go to tweezers.</li>
    <li> Been using these for a while now and I have no complaints. They feel nice in the hand and grasp hair very well. For the price, its a steal.</li>
    <li> I was expecting these to pull all of my fine hairs. They do if they are longer, but I don&#x27;t let my hairs stay long enough to grow that much. I tried and tried but I could not get the little short hairs. I felt like t-rex trying to scratch an itch. It just wasn&#x27;t going to happen.</li>
    <li> For 3 Dollars? these have to be the best tweezers ive ever used. I normally thread my brows or use a razor to clean them up , and I was looking for a good tweezer to help clean up the stray hairs . I stumbled upon the Revlon tweezers and bought them to try, it was a plus that they were Pink too! When they arrived they looked just like they did online. I absolutely fell in love with them, they are so precise and get even the tiniest hairs. I love love love them! My sister used them once and begged me to keep them, this is my second pair! they are a God send. 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and she likes it.  It does a good job, but doesn&#x27;t have the strongest grip strength among tweezers we have tried.</li>
    <li> Best tweezers ever invented.</li>
    <li> this was a great deal, it gets all the work done, and is very handy in plucking out the small hairs. I would recommend this!</li>
    <li> My wife did not like these tweezers. She says that they don&#x27;t grab as good as the ones with the straight shafts.</li>
    <li> I use this item everyday while doing my daily routine of plucking before I go to bed at night and would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many, from top name brands to cheap grocery store ones, I have very fine hair that other tweezers wont get, these get it the first time every time, less pain!</li>
    <li> Not item I was looking for, item description very incomplete, also I would have liked to see more pictures of tweezer from different angles</li>
    <li> These are not as sharp as they look, you can&#x27;t do anything with them once I opened them I threw them out.</li>
