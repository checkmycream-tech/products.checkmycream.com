      <li>Be sure to warm area with a hot wash rag first.</li>
      <li>I have just begun my research and use of essential oils and have decided Young Living Oils are the best option.  </li>
      <li>I did some research on the mix of oils in this product and found out that other than a great scent aka aromatherapy, the oils in this mix are thought to be COX-2 inhibitors, to reduce inflammation.  </li>

      <li>This is one of my favorite Young Living products.  </li>
      <li>Significant relief comes pretty fast.</li>

      <li>but he did not believe it helped him much.</li>
      <li>I really like the idea of getting the result I want, and I like the idea of reducing the footprint of exposure to the area of interest.  </li>
      <li>This has helped so much I do not always need pain med.</li>
      <li>Provides really temporary relief but it helps.</li>
      <li>I tried many other products</li>

      <li>I highly recommend it to people-</li>
      <li>It seems to clear my bronchial problems and breathing was much easier in the high altitude.</li>

      <li>This is my first time using Essential Oils to ameliorate muscle soreness.  </li>

      <li>Muscle relaxers only helped so much.</li>
      <li>Deep relief using therapuetic grade healing essential oils, very high quality ingredients!  </li>
      <li>I have major pain</li>
      <li>Even though it&#x27;s small, it lasts for a reasonable amount of time depending on how much pain you have.</li>
      <li>is a natural, non-toxic remedy for headaches, various aches and pains, etc.</li>
      <li>Basically it&#x27;s like putting an anti-inflammatory agent directly on the area of interest, without exposing your entire body to medication.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love the essential oils from this company so my expectations were pretty high. Sadly this product wasn&#x27;t as strong and as effective as the similar product put out by Doterra and its more expensive. :(</li>
    <li> I just love this oil! I have horrible sciatica and this works I&#x27;m a snap. Rub a little on &amp; sit on a heating pad (on low) for about 20 minutes and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
    <li> This is a remarkable product. I have 10+ headaches due to a head injury. If I use this product as soon as I feel a headache coming on, quite often it stops it within minutes. It smells similar to a Ben-Gay type product, but is far more effective. I carry it with me everywhere. The only negative I see is the price. I have friends who have tried mine and like it, but feel it&#x27;s too pricey. Even though it&#x27;s small, it lasts for a reasonable amount of time depending on how much pain you have. I would like to see the manufacturer offer a more economical size, or find some way to bring the price down, so that more people would be able to use it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years!  I have a bad neck and it really helps..  A bit high on the price</li>
    <li> this product came in a quick order. and was wrap nicely with no breakage. It a great product and the company was nice to work with</li>
    <li> Product is Pricey and works well but I found The Panway by the same company works better for tendon pain.</li>
    <li> My massage therapist introduced me to this great little pain reliever, and while it won&#x27;t replace her healing touch, it is always there in my medicine cabinet waiting to ease my pain. Has a strong but pleasant scent. . .doesn&#x27;t bother my asthmatic husband at all.</li>
    <li> Must have for deep muscle aches heats up instantly if on proper spot small bottle goes a long way and relief lasts as well I tried many other products this is best</li>
    <li> Deep relief using therapuetic grade healing essential oils, very high quality ingredients!  I use it for cramps( including menstrual) sore muscles, pain headache (caused by sore neck) and abdominal gas pains.</li>
    <li> Everyone&#x27;s body responds differently... We bought this to help relieve headaches. Help&#x27;s some with my headache&#x27;s. Not an instant relief for me however, the some that it does help with I am thankful for.:)</li>
    <li> I Love this product!! I am a massage therapist and use this product at my office. Great for muscle relaxation.</li>
    <li> This product is one of my better purchases.  It seems to clear my bronchial problems and breathing was much easier in the high altitude.</li>
    <li> I have just begun my research and use of essential oils and have decided Young Living Oils are the best option.  This one helps with muscle soreness.</li>
    <li> I bought this after having been in a car accident. I was having a lot of neck pain and headaches. Muscle relaxers only helped so much. This helped fill in the gaps and I love the smell</li>
    <li> This is my first time using Essential Oils to ameliorate muscle soreness.  WOW!  This product is fantastic!  Even my husband uses it and asks for it.  How do Essential Oils work?  I did some research on the mix of oils in this product and found out that other than a great scent aka aromatherapy, the oils in this mix are thought to be COX-2 inhibitors, to reduce inflammation.  Basically it&#x27;s like putting an anti-inflammatory agent directly on the area of interest, without exposing your entire body to medication.  As a scientist, I find this fascinating, and exciting.  I really like the idea of getting the result I want, and I like the idea of reducing the footprint of exposure to the area of interest.  Excellent product for me!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite Young Living products.  I use it all the time for shoulder pain.  I would recommend all Young Living oils they are the best quality on the market.</li>
    <li> Like this so much, I signed up as a distributor just to be able to purchase this item at a DEEP discount!  Find keeping this item with me in my purse, as well as at the bedside table is a natural, non-toxic remedy for headaches, various aches and pains, etc. Occasionally, I&#x27;ll get a muscle spam/cramp that just doesn&#x27;t want to go away--not with message, a hot bath, or anything.  When I do, I roll on Deep Relief and then use my heating pad.  Works like a charm every time!</li>
    <li> CRAP....don&#x27;t believe this fantasy</li>
    <li> These little tubes are amazing. For migraines, just roll on the temples; or any painful area. Significant relief comes pretty fast.</li>
    <li> Had good relief from product, but there did not seem to be a lot of product for the cost.</li>
    <li> omg, best stuff ever!!! If you like icy hot but hate how its hard to control the burn that comes later, you will LOVE this. Best sensation ever!</li>
    <li> Great stuff with no offensive odor. I carry it in my purse and can use it on my back as needed.</li>
    <li> This product feels so good on the neck and shoulders after a long day at the computer. It is also great for headaches.</li>
    <li> Deep relief helps muscles relax.  I&#x27;ve used it for sinus headaches as well as for helping achy joints &amp; muscles.  I plan on using it again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my mom, she keep it with her in her purse and uses it when she feels a head ache coming on. She loves this product!!!</li>
    <li> WE CARRY THIS IN SADDLEBAGS ON MOTORCYCLES. Riders loved this for their wrist at the end of a long day in the saddle. A few also used on their backs. Be sure to warm area with a hot wash rag first. Pat area dry and then apply. Have tried &#x27;similar&#x27; natural products which produced no relief, so it must be the ratio of the ingredients . . .</li>
    <li> I am bone on bone in my knees so it takes a good product to give me relief this roll-on really works!  I use it at bedtime so I do not wake up as stiff and sore.  I also use it on my neck and hands good stuff!</li>
    <li> My mother sells another brand of essential oils but they don&#x27;t have anything that works like this stuff does.  She keeps  requesting that I get it for her because it works the best on her neck and shoulder pain.  I highly recommend it to people- I&#x27;ve only used it once or twice myself but I don&#x27;t have as many aches and pains.  My mother swears by it!</li>
    <li> I needed something that really worked to help my muscle and hamstring injury, My manager mention this item to me, and I&lt;br /&gt;decided to give it a try. I did a little research on it, and decided to give it a try. It is a bit expensive for the amount that you&lt;br /&gt;get. The larger size was out of my price range. It worked deep down to where I could function at work.</li>
    <li> I have only used the deep relief roll - on once. My husband used a lot of it on my back and I got relief for several hours. It does have a very strong odor which someone might not prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied it on my husband&#x27;s back but he did not believe it helped him much.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, it helps with my chronic neck pain.</li>
    <li> This has worked great for me.  I have hip, leg and back pain due to bulging disc in my back.  This has helped so much I do not always need pain med.</li>
    <li> this is a wonderful product. Have used it several times so far and it works very well. Smell is not that great but of course that is not the big issue. It works, that is the best.</li>
    <li> Provides really temporary relief but it helps. I roll it on-- it&#x27;s not greasy or runny. I have major pain so I would think for minor aches and pains it would be suitable.</li>
    <li> I was in a serious car accident 3 years ago and I have been suffering from migraines ever since because I was ejected from the vehicle and landed on my neck. I&#x27;ve been in and out of nurologists/dr office and have tried so many kinds of medication...this is the only thing that works for me! I feel my neck pain go away almost immediately. Highly reccommended!!!!!!!</li>
