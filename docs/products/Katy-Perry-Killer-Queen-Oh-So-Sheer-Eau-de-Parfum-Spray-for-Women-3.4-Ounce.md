      <li>I really really love this perfume....</li>
      <li>Love this smell more than the original killer queen scent.</li>
      <li>It scenes isn&#x27;t to strong n</li>
      <li>but its nothing really unique.</li>
      <li>Smells too sweet for me...</li>
      <li>The bottle is really cool.</li>
      <li>So fresh and pretty!</li>
      <li>If the original killer queen is to much for you.</li>
      <li>However, its a light scent, and if you spray enough, you&#x27;ll enjoy whiffs all day.</li>

      <li>I think it&#x27;s better than the red Killer Queen.</li>
      <li>My favorite scent is still her 2nd perfume meow.</li>
      <li>This perfume has less red berries and patchouli, and has more gourmand notes like praline and caramel (my faves).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of Katy Perry&#x27;s music, and I&#x27;m really far off from her target group, but I like what I like....</li>
