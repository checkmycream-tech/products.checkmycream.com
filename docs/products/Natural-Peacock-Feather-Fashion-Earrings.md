      <li>It would be great for you to see the back of the earrings in this listing.</li>
      <li>Overall I&#x27;m happy about them</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so excited to wear them with my peacock costume.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re original &amp; unique.</li>
      <li>It must be nice to be able to see through a different pair of eyes.\\</li>
      <li>I wore them on my cruise to Jamaica, really stood out and went perfect with my other Peacock accessories.</li>
      <li>The pair that I received my daughter really enjoyed them, but I am still waiting on my pair, please advise thanks.</li>
      <li>they where very pretty but as soon as i took them out of the package the feather fell out</li>
      <li>Very pretty.</li>
      <li>I love them and they are long which I love.</li>
      <li>These earrings are pretty!</li>
      <li>I was able to glue back together, but quality is cheap.  </li>
      <li>They have a more rounded, natural look than the picture shows.</li>
      <li>They are fun to wear.</li>
      <li>That said they are nice and versatile, just smaller than I thought.</li>
      <li>They have vibrant colors, they are real peacock feathers, and they are a fabulous price!</li>
      <li>When I bought the feathers I was really excited, because I&#x27;d searched for about an hour for a pair of peacock deaths earrings that weren&#x27;t tacky and also reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>so if i would turn my head just right my earring would lift right out of my ear</li>
      <li>Lol i am of small stature</li>
      <li>The brown bottoms of the feathers also almost match my hair color, which I think looks kind of strange.</li>
      <li>The earrings are very lightweight, they kind of have a 3D effect in the blue part.</li>
      <li>/&gt;they are light, twist in the wind and so far are in tact</li>
      <li>They are nice and long, but very lightweight.</li>
      <li>other than that, the earrings are nice.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ll be interested to see if others like them as much as I do.</li>
      <li>The delivery was pretty fast and the envelope these came in wasn&#x27;t damaged at all.  </li>
      <li>They catch on anything I&#x27;m wearing because they are just too large.</li>
      <li>This is true with my new Natural Peacock Feather Fashion Earrings!  </li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t hang very well.  </li>
      <li>so can say much( good/bad)</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t remeber much difference,</li>
      <li>In addition, it looks like someone took a pair of scissors to the side of one of the earrings and the feathers were very static-y and separated into pieces when they arrived.</li>
      <li>Very pretty, colorful and long.</li>
      <li>but hey that was more of my fault than anything so usually when I wear this I take my right side off to drive and just rig it on my visor&lt;</li>
      <li>the length is not too long so make sure that u r ok with th emedium to small legth of the product</li>
      <li>The seller was very accommodating to send a new pair, but I am just going to stick with what I have.  </li>
      <li>Thease earrings look just like the picture,  except the color is less vibrant and more subdued.  </li>
      <li>I was able to rig it back together and in fact I still wear them, but I then realized why they were only $3.</li>
      <li>I defenetly will buy more in the future since they are feathers and dont last along time</li>
      <li>They are high quality feathers, an decently well made.  </li>
      <li>Very light and could be worn everyday with all types of outfit.</li>
      <li>Not as big as pictured, however, I think they are just the right size, not to be too gaudy.  </li>
      <li>they&#x27;re the exact same length as my hair when I straighten it (about my collar bone).</li>
      <li>These earrings are truly beautiful but much too long to wear comfortably, they drag on the shoulders (at around 4&amp;#34; in length) and I will be unfortunately cutting the fringe off the bottom to make them wearable.</li>
      <li>One little girl (3 years old) said, \\&quot;You have beautiful blue and green eyes on your ears.  </li>
      <li>the picture online shows this earring much larger than it really is.</li>
      <li>My ears are sensitive to non gold earrings</li>
      <li>Cheaply maed and came bended-I am not sure I could wear them at all.</li>
      <li>They are pretty, but the actual feathers are small - barely three inches.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I do love my earrings they are as described aren&#x27;t falling apart well not on their own, let me explain I did have my seat belt on and when I turn my head my earring would snag on the shoulder strap causing it to lose a little piece here or there at the bottom but hey that was more of my fault than anything so usually when I wear this I take my right side off to drive and just rig it on my visor&lt;br /&gt;they are light, twist in the wind and so far are in tact</li>
    <li> I ordered these based on past reviews, and they are super-cute earrings!  Not as big as pictured, however, I think they are just the right size, not to be too gaudy.  After one hour of wear, the little silver springs both came off, and one of the feathers fell out.  I was able to glue back together, but quality is cheap.  The seller was very accommodating to send a new pair, but I am just going to stick with what I have.  Be aware that they are pretty cheap quality!!!!</li>
    <li> They say that \\&quot;Beauty is in the eye of the beholder!\\&quot;  This is true with my new Natural Peacock Feather Fashion Earrings!  They may not sparkle, but every person that have seen them on my ears have given me wonderful complements on them.  One little girl (3 years old) said, \\&quot;You have beautiful blue and green eyes on your ears.  It must be nice to be able to see through a different pair of eyes.\\&quot; This comment means that they&#x27;re unique!  Although this product is found on Amazon, in order to buy them Amazon links to the company that makes them.</li>
    <li> These earrings are absolutely beautiful. They have vibrant colors, they are real peacock feathers, and they are a fabulous price!</li>
    <li> The delivery was pretty fast and the envelope these came in wasn&#x27;t damaged at all.  The earrings are very lightweight, they kind of have a 3D effect in the blue part. They can be a little flimsy sometimes though.  Overall I&#x27;m happy about them so that&#x27;s all that matters. (:</li>
    <li> This earrings were delivered on time and very beautiful. Very light and could be worn everyday with all types of outfit. Looks elegant and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> They are high quality feathers, an decently well made.  The only complaint I have is that based on the picture with the model, I expected them to be larger.  They are pretty, but the actual feathers are small - barely three inches.  That said they are nice and versatile, just smaller than I thought.</li>
    <li> These are nice and full feathers. I purchased initially for myself but ended up giving to my niece for her 13th birthday. She loves them.</li>
    <li> These earrings are not even close to what they are advertised as. They have random chunks cut out of the feather at unnatural sharp angles. Horribly disappointed, don&#x27;t waste your money this is some serious false advertising.</li>
    <li> When I bought the feathers I was really excited, because I&#x27;d searched for about an hour for a pair of peacock deaths earrings that weren&#x27;t tacky and also reasonably priced. All seemed great when I found this set. But when I pulled them out of the bag, one of them simply detached from the earring part. I was able to rig it back together and in fact I still wear them, but I then realized why they were only $3.</li>
    <li> Bought these to go with a necklace, and I love them. Very good price and very pretty! They are nice and long, but very lightweight.</li>
    <li> I wore these to a island. They are so lovely! I wore it with a long summer dress and sandles! The dress was gray!</li>
    <li> Nice for the price. They definitely make a fashion statement. They&#x27;re original &amp; unique. I gave a pair as a gift.</li>
    <li> Looks just like the picture. Looks great on and very nice with dark or light hair. def glad i bought these so cheap and great looking!</li>
    <li> i have not yet get these.i ordered for this in about months now not days! and not yet in.well i dont have it so can say much( good/bad) and nobody has send me an email saying it on the way to be delievered or ......nothing</li>
    <li> love them.. super cute super light... got lots of compliments! I defenetly will buy more in the future since they are feathers and dont last along time lol</li>
    <li> These are beautiful peacock eyes but they come folded in a small envelope and I haven&#x27;t been able to get the crease out of them yet.  For that reason, I don&#x27;t think I would buy them from this company again.</li>
    <li> they where very pretty but as soon as i took them out of the package the feather fell out and i had to glue it back in i was so hopping for them to be wearible but im scared to wear them</li>
    <li> Its very light.  doesn&#x27;t hang very well.  but I still like them.  Great conversation piece.  It seems like one was wider than the other.  I guess when its hand made they were not going to be exactly  same.</li>
    <li> Perfect for the price. I wore them with a peacock costume and they were a hit. My ears are sensitive to non gold earrings so I knew these would be a problem. The earring hook is very cheap and I had to bend them a little to make them stay in.</li>
    <li> Very pretty, colorful and long. I love them! I wish you sold other feather earring. I make them, but it is tedious work</li>
    <li> These are also nice.  I don&#x27;t remeber much difference, if any. I think that the feather earrings are cute and playful and sexy.  They are fun to wear.</li>
    <li> These earrings are pretty! I love them and they are long which I love. Looks real too me, but I am not sure. Very pretty.</li>
    <li> the picture online shows this earring much larger than it really is. other than that, the earrings are nice. i love them. i compared them to the earrings on the picture and they are much smaller. i think they should use the actual earring on the mannequin to show the size and what it looks like on.</li>
    <li> I purchased two pairs of these feather earrings and I have yet to received both pairs. I have tried to reach the company but there has not been a response as of yet. The pair that I received my daughter really enjoyed them, but I am still waiting on my pair, please advise thanks.</li>
    <li> These are beautiful earrings.  What I like best about them is that they weren&#x27;t cut off at the bottom as so many peacock earring are.  They have a more rounded, natural look than the picture shows.</li>
    <li> its so cute and lovely..........really goes well with formals and casuals too. i love the color. the length is not too long so make sure that u r ok with th emedium to small legth of the product</li>
    <li> Perfect. I wore them on my cruise to Jamaica, really stood out and went perfect with my other Peacock accessories.</li>
    <li> So pretty nice and dangly. Very light weight. I&#x27;m so excited to wear them with my peacock costume. Great price</li>
    <li> I wish the seller specified the length of the earrings. Based on other reviews, I thought that these earrings would be relatively small. For me, the earrings are just too long- they&#x27;re the exact same length as my hair when I straighten it (about my collar bone). The brown bottoms of the feathers also almost match my hair color, which I think looks kind of strange. In addition, it looks like someone took a pair of scissors to the side of one of the earrings and the feathers were very static-y and separated into pieces when they arrived.</li>
    <li> Love these beautiful, natural earrings from reclaimed peacock feathers. I plan to sell these earring s in a business and I&#x27;ll be interested to see if others like them as much as I do.</li>
    <li> These earrings are truly beautiful but much too long to wear comfortably, they drag on the shoulders (at around 4&amp;#34; in length) and I will be unfortunately cutting the fringe off the bottom to make them wearable. They catch on anything I&#x27;m wearing because they are just too large.</li>
    <li> I just received these in the mail today, 9 days earlier than expected. They were packaged well, they have beautiful colors in them, great for dressy or relaxed looks. They are delicate so be careful with them. I would get another pair of these in a heartbeat!</li>
    <li> i liked them alright they are very reasonable in price so for what i paid they are good . Lol i am of small stature so i don&#x27;t have a long neck but one for my size so the problem was the earrings are a little stiff so if i would turn my head just right my earring would lift right out of my ear i found it on the floor 3x @.@ lol but thats just me.</li>
    <li> Cheaply maed and came bended-I am not sure I could wear them at all. Colors are just slightly darker than on the picture</li>
    <li> When I recieved my earrings, I noticed that on one of them, it looks like someone took scissors and trimmed one side. The product was damaged when I got it.</li>
    <li> No complaints what so ever! Item arrived on time. Neatly packaged, Brand New, works great. Very Fragile but my mom loves them. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchased.</li>
    <li> The earrings are so light you may need stoppers to prevent them from &amp;#34;flying&amp;#34; away. I am happy with the size and the length though if you have a shorter neck it might be challenging to wear because the spine of the feather is long too. It would be great for you to see the back of the earrings in this listing.</li>
    <li> Awesome Feather earrings don&#x27;t bother my ears when a lot of silver does. great with any fashion or just going out to the store.</li>
    <li> Thease earrings look just like the picture,  except the color is less vibrant and more subdued.  These are a lovely,  quality subdued peacock earrings</li>
