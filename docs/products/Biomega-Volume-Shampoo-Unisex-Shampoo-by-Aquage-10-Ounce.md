<li> Any body that has thin hair should use them.</li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <li> This shampoo is great for colored hair.  Not too harsh, making color last longer. First time I tried this was at the beauty shop, now I&#x27;m sold on it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this shampoo once my stylist used it on my hair in the salon. I loved the results and how it smelled. My hair has thinned, so anytime I can find a product that gives me volume, I am all for it. This is definitely worth purchasing!</li>
    <li> I use many of these products and love them all.  Shampoo is good and lasts quite a long time.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to use it.</li>
    <li> I love biomega shampoo and conditioner. A salon recommended this product to me and as soon as I used it. I fell in love.</li>

    <li> This might be a little expensive but if you need volume and sleek hair this is the way to go. It is a large amount too.</li>
    <li> I would not say it adds volume but it does control flyaway hair in a dry climate.  Gentle, good on color.</li>
    <li> Wonderful shampoo, bought first time at hair salon, price was better from Amazon.  Light scent, no scalp dryness, works well on fine, graying hair.</li>

    <li> Used to love this stuff, used it for awhile and loved that I could get it her but I think they&#x27;ve somehow changed the formula recently. It makes my scalp break out now. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This made my hair flatter actually - only after one use.  I asked to return it and the seller refused since it had been opened.  How do you know if you like it unless you try it?</li>
    <li> I have used this for a couple of years and I love it! I gives my hair lots of body.</li>
    <li> Wife loves my hair after using this shampoo. Leaves my hair clean and smelling good.  Hair has more body when you use this shampoo.</li>
