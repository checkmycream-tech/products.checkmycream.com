    <li> Mr Stevens loves this after shave. Product shipped on time.</li>
    <li> This is a great classic after shave. It has a very pleasing light scent. I find it really conditions my skin after a close blade shave.  After shaving I wash the shave cream off my face with cold water, pour about a tablespoon of this after shave in my hands, slap it on my face, then rinse my hands with some more cold water and use my wet hands to pat my face, to raise the oils and let the alcohol sting a little. It&#x27;s the perfect after shave.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift.  Person has used it for years.</li>
    <li> It has a nice aroma. The container is made of heavy glass. If it is dropped, it will not break. I have found that women seem to like this aftershave lotion more than I do. Whenever I go shopping, I use the aftershave and have a better relationship with female store employees.</li>
    <li> Aramis After Shave remains the only after shave that my husband uses.  He has used it for over 40 years.&lt;br /&gt;It has a pleasant masculine odor.</li>

    <li> This is my husbands long time go to.  His favorite.&lt;br /&gt;Great value...&lt;br /&gt;thank you Amazon</li>
    <li> While a little stronger in aroma than I would like, I do enjoy the overall smell.  Sometimes I may dilute it to soften the intensity a bit.  It does give my face a good feeling.</li>
