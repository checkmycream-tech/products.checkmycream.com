<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works great. I only wish it would pivot right to left</li>
    <li> What a nice mirror for a cheap price.</li>
    <li> This mirror is the best one for shaving in the shower I&#x27;ve ever owned. I liked it so much I bought one again when I moved.</li>
    <li> I have been using fogless mirrors (unsuccessfully, lol) for many years. They ALL have fogged up, and most eventually fall and crack. After reading the other favorable reviews, and having recently spent 20 bucks at BB&amp;B for one that after one week, fell off the glass and cracked, I pulled the trigger on this one. IT JUST WORKS. As long as you put the water in the back (as instructed), it totally works. I love how they include the squeegee and have a slot for it as well. 5 star rating for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read the instructions: I mounted this on tile, which is not completely flat, and if you use ALL the glue (as instructed), and wait 24 hours (as instructed), you will be rather pleased.</li>
    <li> This works well. It&#x27;s entirely made of plastic so I am not totally confident it will last for many years but it is well made and works great. At least I&#x27;ll never have to worry about it rusting. I am considering buying a second one for my second bathroom as well.</li>
    <li> its ok but not great it does fog and water spots build up pretty badly.</li>
    <li> Husband does not know how he ever shaved in the shower before with out this product.</li>
    <li> Simple as the title Nice Shower mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yah you gotta fill up the reservoir with hot water to keep it fog less, but takes 5 seconds and there are worst things in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going to be a lot sturdy that those suction cup ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall great product</li>
    <li> Amazing! Doesn&#x27;t fog at all once water is placed in it. Easy to install, easy to use. It was a great gift for my husband. Also Toilet Tree is nice enough to email you and make sure everything is 100%.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always preferred shaving in the shower, and this is the best mirror I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> Works as advertised.  Great customer service...unit fell off shower wall (I forgot to empty it) and sent me new adhesive as well as a new squeegee (have no idea where the original went).  Based on your lighting in the shower, you may want to opt for the unit with the lighting.</li>
    <li> you have to drain it before using it each time. Not as advertised .</li>
    <li> Ok so there are some pros and cons to buying this product and you will have to decide for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will start by saying that the item was shipped quickly and was received in perfect condition. But there are a few things to mention.&lt;br /&gt;Some pros first:&lt;br /&gt;The mirror is large and it tilts so different people with different heights can use it. The shelf is neat for your razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some cons I found:&lt;br /&gt;the mirror DOES fog right up when the water is hot. I have mine mounted opposite the shower head on the wall, the water does not hit it. Now I didn&#x27;t really expect it not to fog, I haven&#x27;t found one ever that never fogs so I was prepared. I found that if you use body wash (or any soap really) and a shower sponge you can use the soap to create a steam barrier and it stays fog less long enough for a complete shave so I&#x27;m ok with that. And the squeegee is a nice thought but as soon as you use it, the mirror becomes dry and fogs right up. I mounted mine on clean dry tile and 2 days after I mounted I was awoken in the middle of the night when it fell off the wall and rolled around the tub. Now even though it fell it did not break, it&#x27;s pretty tough. So all I did was remount it using stronger tape and it&#x27;s been 3 weeks and still holding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ll just say I gave it 3 stars because I pretty much got what I expected. Wasn&#x27;t disappointed or overly excited.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a large, tough mirror and if your ok with passing a little soap over it then you should be happy.</li>
    <li> I recently ordered this item after studying the reviews and it does exactly what I hoped.  I can now shave in the shower and have a mirror that does not fog up!  I was a little dubious when I first received the item, but it does exactly what was represented, was easily installed and works, if you follow the instructions.  Thanks! My only disappointment was finding out there was a version with LED lighting around the mirror border on a more expensive version.</li>
    <li> Over the years I have tried what I thought was about every &#x27;fogless&#x27; mirror available and had resigned myself to shaving in the shower with the perpetual struggle of doing my best with products that didn&#x27;t ready deliver. This mirror is amazing! My experience with mirrors that were mounted with suction cups was that they would not adhere properly to anything but the smoothest surfaces, thus ceramic tile with even a little texture prevented any type of secure mounting. This mirror mounts easily and securely without drilling; and it stays fog-free and delivers a crystal clear image. I have been so impressed with its performance that I purchased an additional one for my vacation home.  It may not be the best looking shower mirror out there, but it is unequivocally one of the best you can buy.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loved this gift.  Confirms that it DOES NOT steam up in the shower.  Easy installation and used daily.</li>
    <li> Having tried a couple of fogless mirrors, this truly fits the need.  I&#x27;ve tried the Sharper image ones that have to be connected into the water supply but while those worked, it was too heavy for the shower head to support which caused issues. This product adheres to the wall with silicone and adhesive tape without any issues.  Just fill it up with hot water when you want to use it and you&#x27;re all set. They even provide a squeegee.  Great stuff -- for anyone debating whether or not it&#x27;s great shaving in the shower, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  The shower is hands down the best way to shave.</li>
    <li> Excellent mirror, the only recommendation I have is to make a more solid tilt feature. Mine wore out from the weight of the mirror with water and I had to buy a new mirror. This still lasted 3x as long as any previous fogless mirror I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
    <li> Nice and sturdy, works very well.</li>
    <li> The anti-fog concept works great, but water leaks out the bottom seam.  Not really a big deal since it happens slowly, but it does speak to the quality of the project.  The adhesive worked just fine on my fiberglass surround, because I knew the importance of proper surface prep, and I followed the directions.  The squeegee is nice, but I wish the shelf had some raised parts, because my razor sits flat and gets rusty if I forget to flip it over.  The mirror has gotten spotty, and I haven&#x27;t tried to clean it, because I don&#x27;t want to risk scratching it.  There may be a little distortion, but&#x27;s it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s a funhouse mirror, and it&#x27;s made for the shower, so big deal.</li>
    <li> It works! Just fill it with hot water like the instructions say and you have a fogless mirror.</li>
    <li> I have had shower mirrors that attach to the shower head stem and they were OK but you had to face the water to use them. My son bought one of your mirrors a year ago, so dad had to have one also. Best money spent in years!, this mirror is AWESOME! I could place it anywhere I wanted and the squeegee with the mirror to rid the mirror of water spots is great! Clean clear mirror everytime and I would HIGHLY recommend to every man out there!</li>
    <li> NO JOKE PEOPLE - FROM THE HORSE&#x27;S MOUTH - THIS IS THE BEST PRODUCT I HAVE EVER PURCHASED IN MY LIFE!!!</li>
    <li> what can be said that hasn&#x27;t already.  Easy to mount, nice size. clear mirror and shelf is nice to have.  bought two for double shower area.</li>
    <li> Just moved to a new house in a new state and one of the first things I did was order a new Toiletree Mirror. I left the original one for the new owner of our old home. This is one product that lives up to the advertised claims-it is flat out great! I recommend it without reservation.</li>
    <li> Had one of these in our apartment, left there by previous tenant. Over the 2 years we were there (have no idea how long it was there before us) this thing worked fabulously. The hinge got a bit on the looser side with wear but always stayed where you put it unless you accidentally bumped it. Just moved to a house and will be purchasing one because we were so pleased with it. Hubby even got a little spoiled being able to see himself shaving in the shower and is really eager to get another one.</li>
    <li> I shave in my shower and so I was tired of shaving by touch...  I was looking on Amazon for a shower mirror and came across the \\&quot;Fogless Shower Mirror\\&quot;...  I placed an order and I received it within a few days, I am Prime member...  Believe it or not, I read the instructions and installed my new shower mirror...  The next morning I was ready to test the claims...  I followed the instructions of filling with warm water and was surprised that all I was required to do was use the squeegee to remove water from the shower head splash and start shaving...  The \\&quot;Fogless Shower Mirror\\&quot; works as advertised and a welcome addition to my shower...  A good investment as far as I am concerned...  Try one, you will love it...  I experienced no problems during installation, good clear instructions and installation products...  I highly recommend the \\&quot;Fogless Shower Mirror\\&quot;...</li>
    <li> Took a day to put up because silicone needs to adhere to wall but then you will have no problem with it slipping from the wall like many others we had that were held up just with rubber stoppers on back.  Used 1st time this morning and was excellent, clear and love squeegy that comes with unit.  Would recommend to anyone, also bought one for our condo at the beach!!</li>
    <li> I am sad to have only found out about this now, I&#x27;m almost 30 years old and I&#x27;m one of those early bloomers if I may call it that. Started shaving at around 15 years old. So I&#x27;ve been shaving for almost 15 year by now, and I&#x27;ve hated every single shower mirror solution ever suggested to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t until I ran across this mirror that I simply had to try it for myself to believe it. Boy was I in for a treat. I set the base up, fill the silicone gaps and peel the adhesive. 24 hours later, I have a fogless mirror in my tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what&#x27;s so awesome about this mirror? Well, it doesn&#x27;t fog.. I&#x27;ve tried all I can from blowing air at it, to cranking up the water to steaming heat, the mirror beads up a little, but there is NO FOG.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How you might say? Well the genius is in the reservoir that houses the water that you fill prior to taking your shower. When that reservoir is filled to the top with warm/moderately hot water, it becomes in direct contact with the back-side of the mirror. This insures that the mirror is the same temperature or close to that of the steamy water vapor that dominates the air inside and around the bath tub, when that happens, water does not condensate on the cold surface of the mirror, instead, it simply passes by or beeds up into big distinctive water drops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether you care about the sciency part of this or not, if you want to shave in your shower, without having to wipe it every second, GET THIS PRODUCT. No I am not paid by the people that made this, I simply enjoy it that much that I took that much time to write about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good products deserve good feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few tips for those unsure about placement/adhesion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Make sure you follow the instructions, that is to put the silcone tube, in its ENTIRETY over the marked gaps, and allow for 24 hours of adhesion before using/running the shower.&lt;br /&gt;- Make sure you pour tolerably hot/warm water into the reservoir before you shower or else the product WILL NOT WORK. The key part of this whole process is the warm water, its what makes it work.&lt;br /&gt;- Drain the reservoir when you&#x27;re done, and if you can, put it upside down so it dries nicely. Dark wet areas when left can be home to algae and other nasty stuff. Be clean and be proactive about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is all, hope you find this useful.or else the product WILL NOT WORK.

    <li> Bought this mirror for my husband and it was leaking at first but there customer service was great and we received a new one within two days. It really doesnt fog up and is so easy to use and clean...I definitely recommend this mirror.</li>
    <li> This is the right product adn delivery is always very fast. Great price too!</li>
    <li> Fogless works, but only if you take the time to fill the back housing of the mirror with warm/hot water each time.  I find it to be a bit time-consuming when you&#x27;re otherwise in the &amp;#34;quick shower&amp;#34; mode.  Not exactly a hassle-free product.</li>
    <li> I started shaving in the shower to help prevent razor burn and this product helped me do that. The only downside is that you have to remove it and fill it with hot water for it to work every day. I was originally concerned about the adhesive strips that are used to hold it in place when I saw them but its held up for a few years now. Being able to adjust it up and down is nice.</li>
    <li> I have tried several cheaper shower mirrors over the years and they all failed by either fogging or falling regularly.  This one is totally different.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now and it is still working perfectly.  It attaches solidly to the wall and will not fall over time.  It absolutely will not fog up when used properly.  I love it and am so glad I finally found the last shower mirror I&#x27;ll ever buy again!</li>
    <li> The product works exactly as it is portrayed.  The installation was simple.  I use it daily.  There is nothing like a shave in the shower.  Great product from a company that seems to truly care about its customers.  Great job.</li>
    <li> I was looking for reliable shower mirror for a long time. They all fall of the wall, not reliable and flimsy. This shower mirror is perfect addition to your bathroom. Easy to install, looks nice and the most important thing-it does the job. Very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I just received this today and have already installed and tried it out. Just as advertised........ fill it with warm water and it doesn&#x27;t fog up in the shower. I know it&#x27;s early, but even for the first time, I can&#x27;t see how it would do any different in the future. It makes good sense with having the reservoir for the warm water in order to keep the fog from forming on the mirror. Nice product and would definitely recommend this to anyone who shaves while taking a shower. Best one of these I&#x27;ve ran across yet.</li>
    <li> Great mirror. Just fill it up with water and its completely fog free. The little squeegee and shelf for the razor are perfect.</li>
    <li> I have had the other fog-less mirror that is piped to shower and much prefer this model. It works really well. It does not have any valves or not steal any water during your shower. I also like that it is wider.</li>
    <li> This mirror does stay fog-free even during loooong showers!  When I purchased this I was skeptical because another fog-free mirror I bought didn&#x27;t work despite the money-back guarantee.  This one is well designed.  The mirror tilts to accomodate users of different heights and there is a squeegee that fits neatly on the shelf to remove water droplets from the mirror.  When full of water the mirror is a bit heavy so make sure to install the holder on the wall with the provided silicone glue.</li>
    <li> I have tried several other mirrors. This has a simple concept; fill the reservoir with shower water to keep the mirror the same temperature as the air and it will not fog. Empty when done. It is very easy to use.  I liked it so much, I bought 2 more.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised. Installation instructions were simple and easy.&lt;br /&gt;The hand held squeegee seems to really work.  Item is priced right too!</li>
    <li> This is easy to mount and great to use in the shower.  It is important to dry it after use so that it does not spot, but even if it does spot, a wipe with a clean towel takes care of it.</li>
    <li> After numerous times of buying so called fog-less shower mirrors I finally found one that works.  I&#x27;ve been using it now all week and what a pleasure to be able to shower and shave.    The bracket is easy to secure and you can adjust up and down so my wife can use it as well.    Fast shipping and item came in as described.    Thanks Toilet Tree</li>
    <li> I have tried the $8 mirrors and the $50 mirrors and just like every time, they end up fogging within a couple of weeks. This mirror uses a concept that can&#x27;t fail. Good price and its very good quality. Wish I would have found this sooner. I recommend to anyone looking for a fogless mirror that will work every time.</li>
    <li> Never knew I needed this, however now that I have it, do not know how I lived without it.  Saves so much time in the morning.  Does not fog up, great product!!!  Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend who shaves in the shower and he absolutely loves it. The mirror does not fog and is big enough to see your entire face.  It uses an actual mirror instead of reflective paint/shiny plastic. It easily stuck to the shower wall and seems very sturdy. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a good shower mirror. It arrived very quickly and in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> We have gone through many fogless mirrors and so far, this one is the best! Loving it every day!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; mirrors in the past and they have never worked. This is the first one (and the last) that I will ever buy because it actually works. Works 100% of the time and never falls off the wall.</li>
    <li> Great product - as described in the reviews. Good clarity in the mirror and nice quality! I recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> \\&quot;This is the one that works! Great design, excellent quality, looks nice and continues to work flawlessly. I already have recommended this to others and will definitely continue to spread the word. Thanks!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I have been shaving in the shower for years, always wiping or splahing water on the mirror in order to see myself.  I bought this mirror about 2 weeks ago and it truly is amazing.  I recommend this for anyone shaving in the shower, I know I dont miss that spot under my chin anymore now that I can actually see myself.  Great product!!</li>
    <li> This mirror really does work well.  It has a reservoir behind the mirror to hold water, hence minimizing the temperature difference and not allowing the mirror to fog.  The attachment system is quick and easy- a little silicone adhesive and it will stick to any surface!  It stuck to my tile without any issues.  There is even a little shelf to hold items.</li>
    <li> Finally a fogless mirror that actually remains clear in the shower and sticks to the wall! I like that I can brush my teeth, take off my makeup, and my husband can also shave in the shower too. The mirror came with 2 pieces of double stick tape and a tube of silicone adhesive. The adhesive is strong and the mirror will stay secure.    It comes with a convenient little tray that you can put a shaver, tweezer, sponge, or toothbrush. It also comes with a little squeegee just in case your mirror gets water or smudges on it. The mirror is also adjustable. Mostly importantly it will always remain fogless, because it contains a reservoir that you fill with hot water, the water neutralizes the mirror and air temperature to eliminate fogging. The mirror conveniently detaches so reservoir is easy to fill.    Overall, this is definitely the best Fogless Mirror I have seen and use so far and I really do recommend it. So far it is working great for me and my husband and with features like an adjustable frame, shatter proof, rust proof, easily attaches to tile, and a shelf, the mirror just keeps getting better!</li>
    <li> I must say I was a skeptic at first but then I became a true believer. I never thought this mirror would work but it does. Just as long as you remember to put in fresh water each time you will have a clean and clear mirror the whole time you are in the shower. I also was worried about it staying on the wall. I mean I have those razor holders fall off all the time. But this mirror, despite its size, stays up no matter what! I would recommend this to any woman who takes off her makeup in the shower or any man who shaves in the shower!</li>
    <li> The mirror sticks on your shower wall and is tiltable and easily removed for filling the water reservoir.    There&#x27;s no chemicals or special coatings to worry about either. The shower mirror is designed to remain fogless and maintenance-free for a LIFETIME. Now in these budget stressful times, THAT&#x27;S a welcome surprise! I also loved that it came with its own squeegee to clean the mirror with, that is built in. PLUS with the small shelf, you can place your razor or cleaning items there!     Just think how wonderful it would be to let YOUR hubby shave in the shower. No more cleaning up that messy, hair-filled sink (you know the guys NEVER get it really clean, even if they try!). I found it really great for removing my make-up-I always seem to miss some spots if I do it in the shower!    I really liked this mirror! It did exactly what it said it would and was simply EASY to use! I get accused of taking too hot of showers all the time, so if this mirror stayed fogless (and it did), then it&#x27;s a keeper for our household! AND it is so reasonably priced, that it would make the perfect Christmas present, especially for all the men on your list! I can&#x27;t recommend it enough!</li>
    <li> While this product is two to 2-3 times the price of your average shower mirror, it&#x27;s easily 5-6 times the product. Admittedly, I was quite skeptical when I ordered it, but I promise you that it&#x27;s truly well designed and fog-free, and the adhesive/silicon mount is infinitely more solid than cheaper suction-cup models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been shaving my face for about 20 years and my head for around 10, and I&#x27;ve owned countless shower mirrors in that time. This model is definitely the best, by leaps and bounds. Fog free chemicals only work briefly, if they work at all, but the hot-water reservoir in the back of this mirror works the hundredth time just as well as it did the first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If, like me, you are tired of the cheap mirrors that lose their fog-free coating after a week or two and come crashing down in the middle of the night when the suction cup gives out, then buy this mirror. You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> I purchased this gift for my husband after he has been buying $5 to $10 mirrors for years which he needs to replace annually since he scratches them up trying to get them to de-fog while showering.  It can be a slight hassle to fill the mirror every time but at least this mirror will last for a while and is truly fogless.</li>
    <li> After numerous so-called fogless shower mirrors left me disappointed, I bought anti-fog wipes/spray, etc.  I thought it was a lost cause until I read the great reviews on this product.  Still skeptical, I figured it couldn&#x27;t be worse than the previous 3 mirrors I have tried over the years.  I am beyond pleased AND surprised.  Where have they been hiding this product?  At first I thought that it would be a pain to actually fill the container with water.  NOT AT ALL!!!!  This is one of the best purchases EVER.  The product arrived in 2 days with FREE shipping!!!!  I have had the best shave with this product.   I can&#x27;t say enough.  If you want a REAL fogless shower mirror, this is it!!!!!</li>
    <li> This mirror is outstanding.  Obviously, the reviews are great and I felt I had to pile on since I usually check the Amazon reviews before making purchases like this one.  The big positives:    1) Easily installed and a more fixed (silicone) attachment to bathroom tile vs. cheap suction cups like other mirrors.  2) Great razor storage shelf  3) Easily filled with warm water each time to avoid fog - clear mirror all the time  4) No serious cleaning required - I&#x27;ve had mine for several months and just soap/water sometimes in the shower is all you need  5) Simple squeegee to clean surface  6) Robust and easy attachment of mirror unit to base (after filling)  7) Nice and large sized mirror to see whole face    I would definitely recommend this to my friends (and I have!) - you can&#x27;t go wrong with this if you don&#x27;t mind the fixed installation (I preferred it) and filling the mirror for each use.    Great design and great execution ToiletTree Products!!</li>
    <li> This product works just as advertised.  Nothing better than shaving in the shower and actually seeing what you are doing.</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my son for Christmas.  The lights help in a dark shower, it doesn&#x27;t fog up, and will not fall.  He loves it!</li>
    <li> I can finally see what I&#x27;m doing! Shaving in the shower is so much better with this mirror. It was easy to install and it is easy to keep clean. It is definitely fog free!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had it a few days.  The mirror is clear and doesn&#x27;t fog up when the hot water is placed in it.  We&#x27;ll see how it holds up to grime over the next couple of months.  Installation was super easy and the tilted angles give you much more freedom when you&#x27;re trying to find where to install it.    Added 7/27/11 -  After 6 months, the mirror is still clear and hasn&#x27;t obtained a film of any kind. I now highly recommend this.  I bought a second one for my second bathroom.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  No sprays or squeegees required.  It makes shaving in the shower very easy.  Just fill the reservoir with the shower head and you&#x27;re ready to shave.</li>
    <li> Finally a shower mirror that actually works!  I&#x27;ve owned a bunch of shower mirrors over the years and even though they all claimed to never fog up, they all did.  I was always having to splash water on them every 30 seconds to clear the fog.    However, this mirror uses the simple premise that if the temperature of the mirror is the same as the air around it, it won&#x27;t fog up.  So by filling the back of mirror with hot shower water, the mirror doesn&#x27;t fog.  Simple, yet genius!    I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product lived up to all of the expectations.  So far, it has held fast to the wall, through some pretty steamy showers.  If the instructions are followed, it really does remain fog free.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror for my husband for Christmas. I was hoping that it would be everything it claimed to be. It was!! He loves it. It was easy to put up in the shower and it is fogless. No more mirrors falling in the shower. It is so easy to use, just fill with water and it stays fogless. I am so glad I bought this, it is the only mirror I have found that is truely fogless.</li>
    <li> Though reletively inexpensive, this mirror delivers as advertised. The installation was very easy and it actually is completely fog free. What a concept - truth in advertising.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised.  Well designed, easy to mount, easy to use.  After one weeks use, I&#x27;m satisfied with it.  Also, delivered promptly.</li>
    <li> This item was easy to install and does exactly as it advertises - no fog and secure mount.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought two (one for the master bathroom shower and one for the kids bath.) Installation of product was simple.  It is truly fog free and performs as promised.  I will be buying more for our lake house and to give as gifts.</li>
    <li> I have tried many fogless mirrors, that either end up falling off the wall constantly, or the coating that makes the mirror fogless fades off.  This works as advertised, I just fill it with the water from the shower and it stays fogless.  Installation uses silicone, which holds the mirror up really good, and is easy to come off if need be.  I would highly recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror as a xmas gift for my boyfriend.  We had brought another fogless mirror from a retail store which was horrid.  I found this on Amazon and the reviews were really high.  I bought it immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really is fogless! My boyfriend uses it to shave in the shower and I use it when I cleanse my face.  No problems at all... The back of the mirror has a container that you fill with shower water and that&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was super fast and came right on time.</li>
    <li> I have used several \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; mirrors in the past, only to have them not work at all, or fail after a few months.  Well, I&#x27;ve had this one for almost two years and it&#x27;s still working GREAT!  I actually re-did my shower and had to remove it from the wall, so I needed new adhesive when the new shower was completed.  I contacted their customer service dept and they sent me another adhesive attachment kit FREE of charge.    Great product, great service, HIGHLY recommend!</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror based on all the positive reviews I saw on Amazon, and I wasn&#x27;t let down.  Putting hot shower water in the reservoir behind the mirror really does make it 100% fogless - there hasn&#x27;t been one time where I noticed even a portion of the mirror fog up.  The mirror comes off the sturdy wall mount easily and fills up by putting it under the shower head for about 10 seconds.  The silicone and double sided tape worked great to stick the mount to the wall and I never feel like it&#x27;s going to detach.  I&#x27;m very satisfied with this shower mirror and recommend it to anyone looking for this type of product!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to shave in the shower - can&#x27;t see what you&#x27;re doing, even though you&#x27;ve probably done it for years.  My hubby uses the sink and always leaves me a mess.  Sure, he tries to clean it up, but not by my standard.  That doesn&#x27;t begin to cover when I want to use a face product and I can&#x27;t see if I got every inch covered.  So, again I have to use the sink.  What if you could do it all in the shower and you wouldn&#x27;t have that second mess to clean up?  Well, now you can!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ToiletTree has an amazing product - a shower mirror! But what is amazing about it is that it&#x27;s fogless and it attaches to your shower wall.  Installation is really simple! A few strips of tape and their silocone that applies easily (just peels right off and leaves no mess) will hang the bracket.  Then your mirror just slides on right on.  The mirror has a water reservoir that you fill each time you want to use it with warm water, which keeps the mirror from fogging.  It also comes with a mini squeegee so you can remove those water droplets out of your way! Oh and I forgot to mention- the mirror is adjustable! A big plus for my house since hubby is six five and well... I&#x27;m not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great gift but also a great addition to all of your bathrooms!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for a Christmas stocking stuffer. He put it up and has been using it without any problems! A few reviews I read before buying said that the mirror was not glass and had a fun house effect to it. I will say that although you can tell its not glass, It does not have a fun house effect. I think it is very clear, and the fogless feature works well! I would buy it all over again.</li>
    <li> I got this for my boyfriend a few months back and he loves it! It stays completely stuck to the tile in his shower and the added shelf to hold his razor is a bonus. He continues to tell me that it&#x27;s one of the best gifts I&#x27;ve ever got him!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with my mirror.  It performs exactly as advertised.  I&#x27;ve had a couple of other mirrors and was disappointed with them.  I highly recommend this one.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that this mirror really is fogless.  To prevent fogging you need fill the mirrors reservoir with hot water.  Also, since we mounted the mirror 5 days ago we&#x27;ve had no problems with it coming down.  The adhesive is a silicone glue which is very durable, I can&#x27;t imagine it going anywhere.    My husband enjoys being able to shave in the shower without having to fight a fogging issue or trying to balance the mirror since it won&#x27;t stick.  And I am really excited for me with this mirror!  I never really imagined I would use a mirror in the shower, but with its handy little shelf it&#x27;s great to put tweezers and razors on.  I really like that I can remove my mascara in the shower and know that it really is all gone!  Also, it&#x27;s great to use for exfoliating.    The frame with the mirror moves at different angles, which is very convenient for multiple users.  The mirror itself is shatter proof and rust proof.  It also comes with a self-stored squeegee for wiping off water droplets.    I would highly recommend this shower mirror to anyone who is in the market for one!</li>
    <li> After trying two other mirrors with marginal results this one was better. But not for long! After about 2 months of use the ratcheting multi-position stops for changing the mirror angle wore out, and  the mirror now only points downwards. I use it now by placing the squeegy between the shelf and the bottom of mirror to prop it up. I still like the mirror. It does not fog when used as directed. I bought another one. Hopefully this one will last longer, if not, I will score it lower next time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mirror for a few months now and it really works. I had an older version without the part that holds the hot water and despite claims there was no way to keep that clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product however, gives you a clear mirror every time. I read some earlier reviews complaining about emptying and filling the water reservoir but I have to say it could not be easier. When I get in, I empty the water from before, put the mirror back on the holder ( the fact that somebody mentioned they had difficulty with this is beyond me, it slots straight in. It&#x27;s about as difficult as putting the top on your pen!). I then have a plastic cup which I fill from the shower pour it in and that&#x27;s it, clear mirror.</li>
    <li> Fogless Shower Mirror by ToiletTree&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;1. Water reservoir method is truly the way to keep a mirror fog-free (the coated mirrors or the drops to coat them yourself - don&#x27;t work and eventually get so hazy you can&#x27;t see anything)&lt;br /&gt;2. The squeegee - nice.  Better than bringing your towel in&lt;br /&gt;3. The small shelf below the mirror - nice - for a razor or toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;4. Very strong mounting with silicone gel/glue (instead of suction cups which can occasionally slide loose)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;1. The mirror has distortion. If you divide it into thirds, the outer two thirds are essentially un-usable - there is even a bit of distortion at top and bottom.  I find the fun-house affect on the outer edges very distracting.&lt;br /&gt;2. The slot to put the mirror back into the holder is difficult to line up.  You take the mirror out to fill it with the hot water, and putting it back in requires craning your head to see behind the mirror to align it so it slides in, if you just try to do it \\&quot;blind\\&quot; you&#x27;ll often get only half in and end up sloshing some water around etc.&lt;br /&gt;3. No drain hole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole reason I got this mirror is that I was using the \\&quot;Ace Fogless Shower Mirror\\&quot; (also uses a water reservoir) - which is not as wide, and I thought it would be great to have the same mirror but wider, and with nice shelf.  However, because of the distortion, you end up getting about the same \\&quot;usable\\&quot; area in both mirrors - about 4-5\\&quot;.  But the [[ASIN:B0019CU2GU Ace Fogless Shower Mirror]] just ends at 5\\&quot; - no extra fun-house mirror margins [uselessly] extending the width.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing with the ToiletTree mirror is the lack of drain hole. With the Ace mirror, because it drains in about 20 minutes, you have the option of either taking the mirror out and filling it directly from the shower head and replacing it in the holder (which is designed so you can EASILY and quickly place it in the holder \\&quot;blind\\&quot;, no missing), OR, you can leave it in place and use a cup to pour in some hot water.  You can&#x27;t do that with the ToiletTree mirror because it stays filled up with the old (now cold) water.  So you are forced to remove the ToiletTree mirror, fill it up at the faucet, and carefully try to slide it back in place.  If I didn&#x27;t already have the super-easy experience of the Ace Mirror&#x27;s design I wouldn&#x27;t complain, but having gotten used to the easier one (and without any distortion), for way less money ($15 at Target), I can&#x27;t see any reason why I would recommend this one, and I plan on putting my old Ace mirror back up.  Yes Ace uses suction cups which can come loose, and yes the razor holder is not made to fit many razor and toothbrush widths so it ends up going un-used. But those are minor issues compared to the fact that it is distortion free and MUCH easier to re-fill with water each time you shower.can&#x27;t do that with the ToiletTree mirror because it stays filled up with the old (now cold) water.

    <li> Great mirror.  Works exactly as promised.  Thought the filling up with water thing would be annoying, but really not a big deal at all.  Love it and would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> this item came on time and as expected. i installed immediately and have had no problems at all. it performs as described and is very secure. i have owned four other mirrors and this is the best one yet. i definitely recommend others to buy this item.</li>
    <li> After years of trying various types of shaving mirrors in the shower, all of which promised the perfect fogless experience, I gave this one a try due to the good reviews and the fact that Amazon made it so simple to try it out and return it if it didn&#x27;t perform.      It works exactly as promised - using technology from the distant past.   duh!  Filling with hot water is simple - the squeegee is simple - the mounting is simple - keeping it clean is simple -     And to think I was about to pay a fortune for one of those mirrors that require plumbing to be fogless................</li>
    <li> Works perfectly.  I was surprised. This is my third fogless mirror and without a doubt the best.  No concerns.    Buy it!  You will be pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Yes it is a bit more expensive but it works.  It does not fog up.  The best part about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t not use suction cups.  My rental has a plastic shower surround and the suction cups do not stick to it.  The Fogless Shower Mirror comes with a tiny tube of silicone that you squeeze onto the desired spot.  once it dries, it is strong and waterproof and it sticks to my plastic shower surround.</li>
    <li> Most fogless mirrors work by having a thin film on top thta resists condensation. That always wears out in 3 months or so. I&#x27;ve bought a dozen or so. SharperImage had a 1 yr warentee, and I was for a while swapping mine out every 4 months.    So maybe you just need to buy some of the stuff and reapply when it wears out? I&#x27;ve tried that too, the spray on stuff lasts maybe a week or so. Not happy with that method.    This mirror works with a resevoir of hot water. Seems to work better, still working 3 months after purchase. Convenient to use and install. Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> It works. Installation was easy, I simply found a spot in my shower that looked like it would provide the best light for shaving and followed the directions from the insert. After about 11 hours (I didn&#x27;t wait the entire 12 hours, or whatever it suggests) I filled the reservoir with hot water from the shower and began shaving. It&#x27;s as simple as that, really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror DOES NOT fog providing the water in the reservoir stays warm. I&#x27;ve spent up to 15 minutes in the shower without it fogging, any longer than that and you might have to dump out the lukewarm water and refill it. I really, really don&#x27;t understand these people who are having a difficult time filling/refilling it with warm water. When I begin my shower I dump out the cold water from my last shower, place the mirror under the facet and fill it with warm water, and step into the shower. It&#x27;s not rocket science. Now let&#x27;s suppose you take an unusually long shower and the mirror begins to fog, you have two choices: 1.) panic and write a negative review about how terribly inconvenient it is when the mirror fogs, or 2.) accept the fact that this product wasn&#x27;t designed by aliens with super powers, spend 4-7 seconds refilling it with warm water, and continue shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, onto the negatives...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror spots up pretty easily. I&#x27;ve had this very same problem with shaving mirrors before. It doesn&#x27;t spot up to the point that I can&#x27;t use it, but it&#x27;s still a bit annoying. Also, the squeegee doesn&#x27;t work well. It just ends up smearing the water droplets on the mirror and making it worse. I usually end up removing the mirror from the wall, running it under water and \\&quot;cleaning\\&quot; the spots with my finger, and replacing it. This isn&#x27;t something I have to deal with EVERY shower, but often enough to bring it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, it&#x27;s worth $20-something dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Edit on 2/9/14:***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about 2.5 years the gear that allows you to adjust the mirror up and down wore out. It&#x27;d still lock into place, but not when the water reservoir was full. This little mirror&#x27;s been a solid performer though, so much so that I bought another one for my new house.</li>
    <li> I was a bit hesitant to pay $30 for this shower mirror but after giving it a try I don&#x27;t regret a single penny. Installing the mirror is incredibly easy and holds to the wall well. The mirror slides in effortlessly and its angles are adjustable which is a great detail. There&#x27;s a small rack below the mirror to hold items such as your razor which is a nice addition. Fill the mirror&#x27;s reservoir with hot water and just like that there&#x27;s no fog. Save time searching for a good shower mirror and go ahead and pick this one up.</li>
    <li> Bought for my husband a year ago. Still wonderful has not had any problems, fell off the wall or loss clarity. Highly recommended and no more hairy sink to clean wahoo!</li>
    <li> The mirror works as advertised and does not fog up, I wish I would have bought one with a light.</li>
    <li> INGENIOUS!  As opposed to those I got in the past, this one works beautifully!</li>
    <li> If you follow the cleaning and the mounting instructions exactly, you will have a stable, fog-free mirror with crystal clear vision. Works as described and shown. Quality product that&#x27;s easy to handle. The only two things I wish that could make it better are the mount process and the missing water drain. This gear is invisible during the mounting process, so you have to practice hanging the mirror back on to the wall mount without any visibility (after you fill it with warm water at each shower). It would be nice if it also had a drain plug, so you could let the water out without dismounting the reservoir. That&#x27;s the only thing holding me back from giving it a 5 star rating.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband. We mounted ours onto shower tile and it was easy to do with no staining of grout or tile. After a year, it is still fog free however, the tilt mechanism either broke or wore down and would not stay up. I contacted Toilet Tree on their website and they sent me out the replacement part for free. I received it quickly and it was an easy fix. It is rare to find such great customer service these days. My husband liked this one so much that we also bought their travel mirror. He loves that it has a pouch he can put in when he throws it in his suitcase.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t even think about ordering another brand of fog-free mirror.  This is simply the best. When used as directed, it&#x27;s impossible for the mirror to &#x27;fog&#x27;.  It&#x27;s the first time that a fogless mirror worked as advertised. It&#x27;ll be the last one  you ever buy. It&#x27;s the greatest!!</li>
    <li> When I got the ToiletTree shower mirror, I compared it with my bathroom mirror that always fog every time I have my shower. I usually wipe the steam off in that old mirror, while the shower mirror from ToiletTree didn&#x27;t get any steam. Perfect! The idea of filling up its back reservoir with hot water before taking shower, is really a smart idea. They say it will help the mirror to have the same temperature as the environment in the bathroom during shower times. I am definitely loving it and using it every time I have my bathroom showers.</li>
    <li> The design works on two levels - The fogless works precisely as advertised.  Just fill it up and go.  Much better than the suction-cup supported ones that I&#x27;ve used in the past.  Additionally, the silicone adhesive that holds the mounting bracket is a step up in design as well;  our shower has two walls that are exterior walls and temperature changes and humidity changes used to loosen the suction mounts so that the mirrors would come crashing down.  (Usually in the middle of the night, of course!)  This design is vastly superior without resorting to drilling and screws.  I expect this $30 investment to last quite a long time.</li>
    <li> Works great.  However, it feels cheap.  The mirror is removable from the wall plate and I always feel like it is going to fall or break if I pull on it.  When comparing this to my Simple Human triple wall mounted soap dispenser, which is right next to it, it just doesn&#x27;t measure up.  Again, it works great, and may be the best one available today.  I would like a more solid construction.</li>
    <li> Originally gave 2 stars. However, distributor (Toilet Tree) went out of its way to make things right. So, I&#x27;m compelled to acknowledge that. The product does what it says and it is a cool design. Toilet Tree Products has earned my recognition for outstanding customer service and I&#x27;m happy to change my review.    If you have an issue with the silicone adhesive used to install the mirror (the tube it comes in may have a failed seal rendering silicone cured and hard as a rock) contact them either by way of Amazon or they maintain a web site. They will make it right.</li>
    <li> Works as designed - no complaints and highly recommend.  You fill the reservoir right behind the mirror with warm/hot water, which is the key to keeping the mirror from fogging.  And there is a mini squeegee in the black tray below it which can remove any water on the mirror.  This is awesome and worth the money no doubt.</li>
    <li> This mirror is so convenient to use - you really can&#x27;t beat it.  The squeegee eventually started to degrade in performance, but the president and director of marketing from ToiletTree went out of their way to fix the situation, first offering to replace the whole unit (which I declined), then offering to replace the squeegee with a new one (which I denied), and finally offering to send me an improved version of the squeegee with better rubber (which I excitedly accepted).  Buy this. You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> This product is flawless!  I&#x27;ve used other \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; mirrors in the past, but this one is the first to actually remain fogless every time.      Also, other mirrors use suction cups that simply don&#x27;t work.  This mirror uses a silicon adhesive and double-sided tape to stay put.      Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This by far is the best mirror we have ever purchased for our shower. Very easy to use and has an easy adhesive rather than suction cups. Will definitely recommend to others!</li>
    <li> the product works great.  i&#x27;ve had it for about 3 weeks and when filled with hot water, it doesn&#x27;t fog up.  i had bought another fogless mirror before from bed bath and beyond, but it didn&#x27;t do the job.  I like this.  It&#x27;s sturdy, of a good size and it does the job. Great product.</li>
    <li> This was just what I&#x27;ve been ;looking for for years ! Reading the reviews, I ordered one quickly.  My mirror came, but the silicon had dried out.  I called, and the new silicon was delivered the next day.  Being the original all-thumbs unhandyman,  I was worried about installing it.   But, even for me, it went up and stayed up.   It works perfectly ! Thanks !    (BTW, I had to call because the e-mail address didn&#x27;t work....)</li>
    <li> This product meets all my expectations. It well surpasses the previous type I&#x27;ve used (one of those that connects below the shower head; which always leaked a bit). There are many more (and much more) expensive products out there.  No need to spend that much.  This one performs and is a GREAT Value!</li>
    <li> This product requires a water reservoir to be filled with warm water.  Which means it has to be emptied and filled each time you use it.  It also requires a lot of adhesive (the instructions say use the entire tube provided and that is the case) to  sufficiently stick to the wall to prevent it from falling particularly when it is full of water.  Prep of the wall tile is critical otherwise there will not be sufficient adhesion to hold the mirror on the wall - again particularly when the reservoir is full of water.     The flat shelf for the razor/accessories, which is without a lip is useless as anything you put on it is likely to slip off.  The squeezy that comes with it tends to slide out of its holding slot.  The mirror itself is ok but for $30 the entire thing is over priced.  With the need to fill and empty the reservoir all the time, the shelf useless and the squeezee sliding out of its holder from time to time,  I have put back into use the old $15 mirror I got at Bed bath and beyond....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for about 8 months now. I&#x27;ve been waiting to write this review thinking that one of these days it&#x27;s going to fail on me. So far, so good. It was easy to assemble and since my shower is marble, I was afraid it was going to fall off because of the smooth surface. It has never fallen. I love this product because I like applying facial products and also brushing my teeth in the shower. I like that it&#x27;s adjustable and filling the reservoir is soooo easy! I always forget to empty it when I get out, but as soon as I take my next shower and it fogs up, that&#x27;s when I remember to empty the old water and replace it with new warm water. The squeegee is cute and it doesn&#x27;t take off EVERY last drop of water but you can still see yourself very clearly. I love this product and recommend it for anyone, especially a birthday or Christmas gift.</li>
    <li> I have purchased many fogless mirrors that are not fogless.  This one is.  It&#x27;s a little more work but it does work.  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This mirror works perfectly. Old shower mirrors I&#x27;ve had all used suction cups to stay on the shower wall, and would fall off regularly.  This one with the silicone to attach to the wall isn&#x27;t going anywhere.  The mirror is simple to take off and fill with hot water, and  I&#x27;ve had zero fogging with it (other \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; mirrors always had fog after the first few uses.  The little shelf is great for holding the razor....other mirrors I&#x27;ve had only had a little hook to hold the razor and often it&#x27;d fall, or I&#x27;d knock it off.  It&#x27;s much more stable on the shelf. All in all, a great product.</li>
    <li> We have only had the mirror up for less than a week, but so far it&#x27;s great.  Attached well to the fiberglass shower wall tiles and we like the way the mirror is adjustable. It really does stay fogless as long as you use it like it is intended which is to fill it with water before each use.  So far this is the best shower mirror we have ever bought!</li>
    <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve purchased and thrown out at least 5 different shave mirrors.  All of them said they would never fog, and all of them said they&#x27;d never fall.  Well...all of them fogged and most of them fell.  This is the first mirror I&#x27;ve ever seen with the water reservoir behind the mirror.  It works like a charm!  Plus you don&#x27;t have to screw around with suction cups that eventually fail.  It stays put with silicone adhesive (supplied) and a couple strips of 3M double-sided tape.  The supplied squeegee is handy too.  I&#x27;d have to say so far, this is the best shower mirror I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
    <li> I do not normally bother with writing reviews but I purchased this product solely on two reasons being the suction cup mirror I had been using for too long was terrible and reviews for this product were too good to not give it a shot. This product works exactly as described. It comes with so much silicon it will never fall till you yank it from the wall, which is good because it holds more water than I expected.  Best aspect besides those really talked about is the included squeegee. With 1 quick top to bottom swipe all that water is removed without streaks. Kudos.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for an anti fog mirror for your shower, don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this one.  I have owned a couple of anti fog mirrors and they don&#x27;t hold a candle to this one!  The price is great and the mirror is actually truly fogless, thoughout your whole shower!  Installing the mirror on your shower wall is a piece of cake, just make sure to read manufacturer&#x27;s instructions and give it the 12 hour dry time recomemded before use.  Fill with warm water, squeegee off the water drops and you have a perfect reflection staring back at you!  I am thinking about buying one for my father for Christmas.  Truly happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I am happy with this product.  I installed it a few weeks ago and it has remained in place.  The adhesive is far better than I expected.  Once you fill it with hot water, the mirror remains fogless.  And...when you are done, the mirror unit lifts off the base easily so you can empty it.  It is very simple!!!</li>
    <li> I have tried quite a few mirrors in the past and this one is by far the best one and at a decent price. If you want a mirror that works great and does not fog at all then this one is perfect. I wish I would have found it sooner.</li>
    <li> This product has a 2.5 year life, then the adjustment mechanism wears out, and it drops to look at your toes no matter how many times you adjust it.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband last month.  Best thing about this product is that it does not have suction cups nor does it hang from the shower head.  The silicon adhesive does take 12 hours to dry but it is well worth the wait.  This product is truly fog free as well.</li>
    <li> ....I&#x27;ve found a shower mirror that actually functional. First, when used as instructed (actually filling it with warm water), it is really fogless. Second, it hasn&#x27;t come crashing down at 2 am, scaring everyone in the house like the previous 2 that used suction cups. The adjustable tilt is a nice feature, but makes the overall mount a bit bulky. Not a problem for me, but maybe others.</li>
    <li> This mirror is, overall, nice.  Large, roomy, and clear.  One thing I didn&#x27;t see, or overlooked, was the fact that it stays fog free by adding warm water to the back each time you use it.  That&#x27;s pretty slick, but it also means you have to empty it after anyone takes a shower.  So, for instance, if my wife takes a shower - even though she does not use it, it can still get water inside of it.  Yes, we did mount it away from the main stream of water.  I think to earn a five, the manufacturers could add a slight tilt/valve that allows you to simply open it up to empty out after each shower.  As of now you must physically remove the mirror after each, every, shower and then turn it upside down.  I&#x27;d probably still buy this one again though.</li>
    <li> Great mirror and superb customer service!  Definitely worth every penny, especialky since it was such a grest deal to begin with!  They even sent me an extra bracket when i told them I was moving and needed t to move the mirror!</li>
    <li> It is all and more that I had hoped.  I ordered it days before Christmas and still was able to receive it on time.  They followed up to see if we had any issues or questions - which we did not. Their service was outstanding.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using a mirror to shave in the shower for about 20 years. I have bought all types and prices but even though they all start by working reasonably well, after a while they all lose their protective coating and begin to fail (or worse, parts of them begin to rust). The ToiletTree mirror has a completely different approach and it works very well. Granted, it requires some involvement on the part of the user, as the reservoir behind the reflective surface needs to be filled with hot water and emptied after using it, but it is a matter of a couple of minutes, nothing major.  The reason I give it 4 stars is that I think that the emptying of the reservoir could be made easier by adding a drain at the bottom with a rubber stopper, making it easier to empty (after all, it is in the shower, the water is going nowhere but down the drain). So instead of having to remove the mirror and dumping the water, it could be left to drain, reducing further the user daily involvement. That said, the mirror works great regardless.</li>
    <li> I have gone through MANY supposedly fogless mirrors.  I have yet to truly have a product meet their claim, until receiving this product as a gift.  I actually gave up spending money on new mirrors and just made do.  All of the claims of this product are accurate.  It is the BEST fogless mirror I have used in 25 years of shaving!  The mounting is extremely simple and quick and having tried MUCH more expensive products, this mirror is ABSOLUTELY worth the $30 price tag.  I actually did not know the price until now and am surprised at how cheap it is, compared to $75 mirrors that were worthless.  GET THIS MIRROR AND YOU CAN STOP SEARCHING TOO!!!</li>
    <li> I have been shaving in the shower for over 20 years.  I have purchased multiple fog less shower mirrors during that time.  This shower mirror is the best...hands down.  It does not fog up at all.  Also, I had an issue with my purchase and ToiletTree Products handled it immediately and even wrote me a personal note.  I am going to purchase another one for our other shower.  Great product and great service.</li>
    <li> This mirror is as good or better than I expected.  It is crystal clear, and I see hairs I never saw before.  My only issue is that I need it to stand on a window sill, so I did not glue it to anything.  All is fine except I can&#x27;t fill it with water, as the weight makes it topple over.  However, in Arizona, fogging is never an issue, so it is fogless without filling it. Love it!</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror. I got it on time as it was promised and the mirror works great. Great quality. I would buy this again! Do yourself a favor and buy this.</li>
    <li> Truly is fogless. Gave 5 for men on my Christmas list. A must have.</li>
    <li> ...a must have addition for those who shave in the shower - purchased over a year ago and still works exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> A fog free mirror that really works. I shave in the shower and wanted to go the double edge razor route, but first needed a mirror that would facilitate that. I found this and it works great, not very good, but Great! As for the double edge razor, the best shave of my life.</li>
    <li> Husband loves this mirror,  works great!</li>
    <li> Seriously, if you&#x27;re reading this far, you&#x27;ve already put more thought into this than you need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YES -- a shaving mirror for the shower is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YES -- they all call themselves &#x27;fogless&#x27;, but only the water-filled kind actually are, and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YES -- this one is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor, stop worrying, and just buy this one.  You&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as advertised.  Well designed; surprisingly sturdy for as light as it needs to be. Mounting is straightforward, enough of the silicone adhesive is supplied and the combination with the 2 sided tape yields a solid mount.  Ingenious design for storing squeegee.&lt;br /&gt;If you need a truly fog-less mirror this is the one.</li>
    <li> Model with built-in light is wonderful and larger image format. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Got the mirror, and mounted it in 3 minutes.  Let it dry overnight.  Started using it and am very happy with it.  Just what I needed.  Filling the water takes 5 seconds.  It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several mirrors for shaving in the shower. Some fell off due to crummy suction cups, others fogged up and required alcohol wipes and such. This is the most simplistic design I can think of to stop the mirror from fogging. I am very pleased with this product and my purchase and you will be too.</li>
    <li> Great value for the price. Light weight. Strongly recommended.</li>
    <li> They only Fogless Mirror out there.</li>
    <li> I got my mirror yesterday and I think it&#x27;s great!  It is simple to use and clear as day!  I may get a few for my friends!  It&#x27;s about time I find a mirror that works....</li>
    <li> Finally a shower mirror that does what it says....stays fogless! I also love the mounting of the product since every mirror I have ever purchased has fallen off the wall within a week. I have had this mirror in the shower for over a month and it is still completely fogless and solidly mounted to the wall. Well done!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband&#x27;s birthday and installed it to surprise him.  The mirror attaches to the shower wall with silicone adhesive and mirror tape.  It&#x27;s very secure.  I set a bubble level on the razor shelf when applying the mirror to the wall and that worked out great.  My husband really likes it and I think it adds a nice look to the shower.  I am very impressed with the quality of materials and the easy installation.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Always used an electic razor - always on the go.    However, with the fogless mirror i have taken up shaving in the shower.    The mirror is clear; I leave the shving cream near the soap, and the mirror has a shelf for my razor.    I am sold; I am buying another one for my vacation home !</li>
    <li> The Fogless Shower Mirror by ToiletTree is the Best Fogless Mirror on the Market. I have been waiting to write this review since I bought it July 5, 2010 on Amazon.com, but to give my review more credence I waited the recommended 30 days. First, this fogless mirror works perfectly. I have yet to see any fog develop on the mirror what so ever. It is lightweight plastic or similar. The mirror appears to be glass, but it is a high quality reflection without distortion (just a little). It is perfect for any task that you might perform in or out of the shower, but I use it to shave. If you have never shaved in the shower, I urge you to buy this mirror and start shaving in the shower for a closer and more comfortable shaving experience. It uses adhesives to attach to a shower wall. Follow the instructions carefully to mount the mirror mount to the shower wall. Once the mirror is mounted it is permanent, but you can adjust the viewing angle up or down.  You must fill the reservoir with warm or hot water in order for the mirror to remain fogless. That is easy to do. Why I like this type of fogless mirror is the placement of the mirror in relationship to the shower stream. Other mirrors that attach to the shower/water pipe have you standing in and facing the shower stream. That type of mirror allows the water to splash in your face and eyes. The ToiletTree Fogless Shower Mirror allows you to mount the mirror anywhere in the shower that you please so pick your spot carefully as it is permanently mounted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update Dec 15, 2010&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s getting close to Christmas; this will make a great gift. I have had it nearly 6 months. It works as it promises. Alot of people have gone out of there way to provide you with their experiences with this product. Shower shaving is the greatest shave and the Fogless Shower Mirror by ToiletTree is the Best Fogless Mirror on the Market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update Oct 7, 2012&lt;br /&gt;I still love this product. It shaves better than my blades. I can tell because I can see!!! It still looks new. Still works like new. It is nearly 2 and a half years old. I don&#x27;t know if this product is still available or not, but if so, it makes a great gift and it is easy on the wallet and saves you some skin as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update Oct 1, 2014 What drives a man to review a mirror over and over and over again. Obviously, I am pretty, conceited, vain, and quite a snob. I know because my mirror clearly tells me so. Don&#x27;t just buy it for your husband, see just how pretty you are. I tout this mirror because it is a product that does what it says, does it well, and it is affordable.</li>
    <li> great product ...really works....+++</li>
    <li> I purchased this mirror based on the reviews that I have read two weeks ago.  I got it as a gift for my husband.  We have in the past had so called, \\&quot;fogless mirrors\\&quot; -needless to say, they ended up in the garbage.    So here two weeks later, my husband is so very pleased.  Not only does he get to soften up his course beard from the steam in the shower before shaving, he also gets to shave his head at the same time.  Hence why, not only for the great price and quality, it does \\&quot;Double Duty\\&quot;!!!    One thing I can say, I am so sure you will be pleased with this product, that \\&quot;I will give you your money back\\&quot; !!    :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been through a lot of these, even ordered an expensive one from that Hammacher Shll place that fell in the tub in the middle of the night. This one is amazing and a must if you shave in the shower AND if your shower is lined with porous materials like tile. I love the brand name too ;--) (Hysterical) BUY THIS!!!!!</li>
    <li> Finally a fog free mirror that works.  Like permanent mounting as opposed to suction cups on other mirrors. Seems like it&#x27;ll last awhile unlike other fog free mirrors I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> My old shower mirror finally needed replacing after many years of service. This one works great - the simplicity of design to allow the mirror to be fogless is ingenious. I have shaved in the shower for years, and this mirror will allow me to continue for many years to come. Love the squeegee to remove water splashes.</li>
    <li> Like many other customers here, I love this product. It just works as it says it should, no fuss, no annoying setup - easy to understand mounting instructions - just great.    I&#x27;d encourage them to create one with a LED light - my shower is a tad dark, so I&#x27;ve had to get used to that. If they make this, I&#x27;ll buy this too, don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase!</li>
    <li> Good so far.  It does not steam up as long as you fill it with water.  The squeeze is a nice add on to quickly clean the mirror</li>
    <li> I love it !!! A+  I had it now fore 2yr&#x27;s still working great!!!!! just fill with water and your ready to shave. I shave my face and head and noooo fog on the mirror</li>
    <li> I am now a converted shower shaver.  This product is amazing and really does what it is expected to do, which is not Fog and make the Shower Shaving Experience enjoyable.  After a few previous attempts in past years, I got fed up with other products that always fogged up or fell off the wall.  Once I heard about this product I gave it a try and am very excited that it works so great and has solved to 2 problems that all the competition never did.  This Fogless Shower Mirror has really changed my mornings as I used to dread shaving after the shower but now I am able to enjoy a few extra minutes in the shower while shaving and it NEVER FOGS UP and NEVER FALLS to the ground!  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Disclosure: I was lucky enough to win this in a giveaway, but that does not affect my review at all. If it stunk I&#x27;d say so!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mirror works exactly as described - doesn&#x27;t fog up. We aren&#x27;t installing it on the wall, but the stand makes it easy to use.</li>
    <li> This is the best fogless mirror I&#x27;ve ever seen.  It doesn&#x27;t require chemicals; nor must it be plumbed into the shower head.  The reservoir on the back of the mirror does the trick.    But the mirror itself isn&#x27;t as great.  I get a lot of fun-house image distortion everywhere but in the center of the mirror.  If this problem can be fixed, then it will be a five-star product.    I love the little squeegee that clears water from the mirror surface and tucks away unobtrusively.  I added a 3M Command hook to the underside of the shelf, so that I can hang my shaving brush to dry after use.    All in all, a very good product.  Shaving in the shower is much nicer than at a sink.  A good mirror is essential.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical when I first received my mirror.  It felt so lightweight that I was worried about the quality.  I soon found out that I had nothing to be worried about.  Installing the mirror was very simple, and it is so easy to remove from the holder to use the mirror elsewhere!  My hubby and I really tried to get the mirror to fog up, but as long as you follow the directions, it won&#x27;t!  Well worth the expense.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Very pleased at this point but have had in use for only a few days. Have been pleased (initially) with other shaving mirrors in the past only to have them deteriorate after 6-12 months of use. Would be more meaningful to have been asked to review this item a few months after purchase date.  [[ASIN:B003BQ6QXK Fogless Shower Mirror with Squeegee by ToiletTree Products. Guaranteed Not to Fog, Designed Not to Fall.]]  UPDATE @ 12/26/2010 --- After 2 1/2 months this is by far the best shower mirror I have ever owned. Finally found THE ONE. On top of that, my squeegee was damaged by the grandson and I contacted ToiletTree to aks if a replacement could be purchased. A Ms. Parisi responded immediately and (much to my amazement) mailed a replacement to me at NO CHARGE. First Class company with a First Class product. 5 STARS+++  Bill Henry</li>
    <li> Not only did my husband love this mirror being in the shower but he loved using it and was loving that he could now shave in the shower instead of making it a multi-step process. The mirror is stable on the wall, and doesn&#x27;t look like it is going to fall off. The mirror stays crystal clear through the whole shower, no matter how hot the water is that you use. I am impressed!</li>
    <li> I have owned this mirror for a few months now, and everything has been great so far.  I had owned several \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; mirrors in the past and they all failed, whether it was losing the anti-fog ability, or falling off the shower wall.  This product has been firmly attached to the wall since the day I bought it and as has never fogged up in the shower (as long as you use it properly).      The only issue I had with the product was with the silicon adhesive tube that comes with it.  You use the gel to attach the mirror to the shower wall.  The tube I received had hardened, which made it impossible to squeeze out the gel properly.  Yes, I punctured the tip before squeezing, but it would not work.  I ended up squeezing so hard that the tube ruptured in the middle so I ended up applying the gel with my finger.  Other than that, the product is great.  I did not deduct any stars from my review because of this since this issue has nothing to do with the functioning of the mirror.</li>
    <li> As advertised, when it&#x27;s filled with warm water the mirror doesn&#x27;t fog up in the shower, so the anti-fog technology does indeed work.  On the other hand, although the mirror is good enough for shaving, the image is seriously distorted.  More important, at least for me, it&#x27;s a real pain having to remount the mirror precisely on its inconvenient bracket twice during a single shower -- once after filling the tank and again after emptying the tank.  Perhaps I&#x27;m just not coordinated, since no one else seems to have a similar complaint.  But I never find it easy to replace the mirror on its bracket.  This is a clever product, but I hope that someday, someone will come up with an easier way to keep a mirror from fogging up in the shower without any hassle, so that users can just set it up once and then forget it forever.</li>
    <li> With such a large selection of (so-called) fogless mirrors, it can be a bit tough to research what to look for exactly. Hopefully I can save you some time and offer some insight.    This particular mirror features the best design and all the best features. You can tell they put some real thought into it. Here&#x27;s a few reasons why:    1. It uses hot water behind the mirror, which does a fantastic (arguably the best) job of keeping a mirror fogless. The mirror slides easily in and out of a relatively large U-shaped bracket. It just takes a second or two to fill the reservoir on the back with hot tub/shower water, and you&#x27;re set - it will not fog up! No kidding, from my own experience.    2. No suction cups, no crashing mirror. The mount uses relatively strong, semi-permanent adhesives; two square pieces of double sided tape (nearly identical to the mounting squares you see in hardware stores) and a generously sized tube of silicone. Both the silicone and tape have specifically marked places for use on the mounting bracket. Note, that while these are nice and waterproof, and much more reliable then suction cups, neither is permanent-permanent. Silicone is not super glue; it can be removed, along with the tape, without much fuss at a later time if desired.    3. The design is nice, clean, simple, and not too small. Form follows function. The reservoir widens nicely on top to make filling it easier. The shelf below is perfect for your razor, without any needless holding mechanisms. Other shower mirrors are rather small, this one is just the right size (imo) at 6.5in x 8.5in.    4. There&#x27;s a nice, full-length rubber-y squeegee for wiping down the mirror. Any mirror will acquire drops from the spray while you shower. This squeegee cleans them off much better and more thoroughly then your own hands do. Take a look at the fourth and fifth pictures to get a good idea. The black handle slides horizontally into a compartment under the front shelf; the actual white squeegee parthangs down, which makes grabbing it and pulling it out easy.    5. Although irrelevant, even the way it was boxed/packaged was nicely done.    In summation, I rarely give items full stars with no criticism of any kind; even five-star items generally have some minor negative points. This is one of those rare items I simply cannot find fault with. I honestly can&#x27;t think of any way it could be improved.    And although it can cost more then some other shower mirrors, these mirrors are all relatively inexpensive, anyway, so I don&#x27;t see why that matters. Getting something this fantastic is well worth a few extra bucks.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband.... after cleaning the shower well, following the instructions, it was all set up and stays up just perfect.  doesn&#x27;t fog.  He puts water in the back to minimize fog as well</li>
    <li> I tried many other suction cup mirrors which would fall in the middle of the night and scare us to death.  So far this is doing the job and I like the water reservoir to handle the anti-fog issue.    The only question I have left is how long it holds up before the shower water starts to dull the mirror.</li>
    <li> the design is a little clunky, but hey you can&#x27;t win them all. this is a great fog proof mirror that is actually fog proof and is actually a mirror. None of that silver painted plastic garbage. works using physics by warming the mirror with the the shower water. the mirror sticks to your wall with silicone that comes with it so it wont fall off like the suction cup ones. It says that the silicone is easy to remove and wont leave any residue. I cannot attest to that, but I believe it.</li>
    <li> It is hard to find a shower mirror for shaving that has a decent high quality mirror.  I made the mistake of mounting a normal bathroom mirror in the shower and that rusted out in 2 years.  This mirror however has excellent image quality and is actually made for the shower.  It installs very quickly with some double sided tape to hold it in place while the silicone (supplied) adhesive dries.  Total install time was 4-5 minutes.  The mirror part easily slides in and out of base so you can fill the back with hot water.  Immediately takes away fogging for the duration of the shower.  You have to dump out the water and refill for the next shower if that wasn&#x27;t obvious.  The mirror can also be tilted up and down in set detentes to accommodate people of different heights. Assuming you put the mirror in a good place in the shower, you will not be disappointed by this product.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shower mirror. I would highly recommend drilling a small hole in the lower (or bottom) of the back side (one of the corners- not the center) so that the water slowly drains out and you don&#x27;t have to empty it each time. The squeegee doesn&#x27;t work after a few weeks, so just rub your thumb/fingers over it and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
    <li> This fogless mirror by ToiletTree Products is simply awesome!  I have purchased 3 so far. . they make great gifts!  These mirrors stay crystal clear. The water reservoir can be emptied each time or you can just add warm water to heat up the reservoir. Either way, the ToiletTree Fogless Mirror really works.   p.s. You will not even need to use the squeegee that comes with it!</li>
    <li> The Fogless Shower Mirror is great for both men and women.  The installation was very quick and easy.  My husband totally likes it and I love the fact that you can finally see your face while washing it off or if you still have something on your face.  I used to always take a mirror with me in the shower and it was always a hassle to find a place to hang it on and to wipe it off.  The Fogless Shower Mirror I don&#x27;t have to do all that.   So, I will definitely recommend this product for anyone to buy and use.</li>
    <li> My husband has a hard time shaving out of the shower because of how irritated his skin becomes. He has tried everything including  different razors and shaving cream. Nothing worked from keeping his skin from becoming irritated.  So he started shaving inside the shower but always found himself missing spots.  Because of this he added a mirror to the shower.  This mirror would fog up to the point where he couldn&#x27;t use it. Once he wiped the fog off it was back again.  Then we found TioletTree Fogless Shower Mirror.    The ToiletTree Fogless Mirror is guaranteed not to fog in the shower. This is because it offers an Easy to Fill Reservoir. When you are about to take your shower you fill the reservoir, the water than neutralizes the mirror and air temperature to eliminate fogging. My favorite feature of the mirror is the fact that it stays fogless, it&#x27;s adjustable, and it weighs next to nothing.  I remember the first day it was in the shower and my husband had it sitting on the ledge of the tub because he didn&#x27;t want to wait the 24 hours for the glue to adhere.  The mirror fell into the tub and I went to pick it up.  It was so lite.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it. Obviously once you put the water inside it will weigh a bit more, but this was still one of my favorite features.  I also liked the fact that it actually adhered the the tiles we have in the shower.  Nothing we have purchased for the shower has adhered because of the shape of our tiles.  So we were always nervous when our boys took a bath that something would fall on them. Eventually we ended up taking everything down because we were tired of worrying about it.  But we don&#x27;t worry anymore.  The TioletTree Fogless Mirror still hangs on our tiles perfectly fine after 3 months of use. I love this product and would recommend to anyone who would listen! You will love it too.

    <li> Fell off the wall after 4 months.  Also, to make this item not fog you must put water behind the mirror which is normal for a shower mirror.  However, it does not automatically drain like other shower mirrors I have owned and when filled with water in the back the mirror bends a slight bit which makes for a poor reflection.  I would not recommend this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been through 3 fogless mirrors that worked for 3 weeks only. This one works perfectly every time, stays on the wall (unlike the ones with the suction cups) and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it. Great product!</li>
    <li> Until someone comes up with a true no-fog, no-distortion, no-clean, and no-fall mirror for the shower, this is the best I have found and worth the extra money. Filling with water in the shower is not that big a deal and quickly removes the fog; a wipe with the cleverly stored squeegee takes care of any droplets. No worries about falling, like the suction cup designs.</li>
    <li> This mirror is just what I have been looking for.  It is a little pricey at $30, but worth it in my mind.  It does have a slight \\&quot;fun house\\&quot; effect on the mirror when you are more than a foot or so away, but it is not bad and does not interfere with shaving.  Do as another reviewer suggested and just add hot water without emptying each time and it work great.</li>
    <li> I got this product for my boyfriend after reading countless reviews of similar products.  This mirror seems to be a great value, easy to mount and does not fog, does everything as promised!</li>
    <li> This is the best fog less shower mirror that I have owned. I&#x27;ve had 3 before I purchased this one and they all were horrible. I love this one.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice to see a technology that is elegant in its simplicity and actually works. It&#x27;s doubly nice to find a seller that is thoughtful enough of its customers to actually take the time for a follow-up message. Of course, pride of product and listening to Mom does things like that.    P.S. That&#x27;s Mr. Lauri</li>
    <li> This product works wonderfully. There isn&#x27;t much to say beyond that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One suggestion, though: Make sure to empty the water and the end of your shower. Having to empty it before the next shower sometimes gives you a splash of cold water.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror for my husband for Valentine&#x27;s Day.  He was always taking my plain mirror into the shower to shave.  He loves the new gift, it doesn&#x27;t fog over, and is attached easily to the shower wall, making it great to have for a shave!</li>
    <li> this mirror works great for my husband.  Suction cup mirrors won&#x27;t stick to our tile and we didn&#x27;t want to put a mirror on our new shower glass so this was the next best thing.  Haven&#x27;t tried to remove it so I do not know how easy it is to remove.  I wish it looked nicer--would have preferred something a little more upscale but function comes first.  It doesn&#x27;t fog and it stays on.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been through 3 shower-based shaving mirrors in the past 4 years... I was unlucky enough to either buy all of them on a whim or receive them as gifts. This purchase was gonna be different -- I was gonna research it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I did (thanks, Amazon) and found that this one was the most highly esteemed amongst its peers. I got it, installed it, and it works like a charm. This is truly great design here. It attaches with silicone caulk and adhesive strips, which require settling time, but held up very well. The squeegee isn&#x27;t perfect -- it misses drops because it&#x27;s too tiny not to warp a little bit under hand pressure -- but it&#x27;s a great idea, implemented as best as practical for the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a result of having this mirror installed, I&#x27;ve had only 2 shaving cuts in over a month -- a far cry from the several per week with my old crappy shaving mirrors that either got fogged up easily, fell off the wall, or got their special film coating completely marred up just by my using a paper towel with Windex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best one and even looks nice to boot. Get it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve spent many dollars throughout the years on fogless mirrors and none of them have lived up to the name...until now. This is, by far the best fogless mirror on the market today.</li>
    <li> Finally someone has come up with a new/different/BETTER take on the shower mirror.    The Toilet Tree (think about getting a new name, guys...) is a giant step up from the suction-cup mirror I have been using for 5 years.  And, YES, no more suction cup mirror crashing to the floor at 3am!!!  That alone is worth the price.    PRO:      - Fog-free works  - Squeegee a handy addition  - Installation (if you can follow directions) is smart and secure.    CON:      - You have to take 30 seconds to fill the reservoir before you shave...and should probably remember to empty right after you shave so the thing isn&#x27;t supporting the extra water weight 24/7.    - This is not a magnifying mirror...might even be a bit on the wide-angle side.  Takes a little getting used to if you are accustomed to a 3x type mirror.  But that&#x27;s a minor thing once you get going.    I&#x27;m giving it 5 Stars without hesitation because, for the price, it&#x27;s the best thing out there.  Elegant design, elegant execution.</li>
    <li> I love this shower mirror.  It works really well, but you must know that you need to fill the reservoir with warm/hot water.  At first I assumed (idiotically, maybe) that you just filled it up once and it would work, but the water will cool off and it will not work well.  I pour out the reservoir and refill it when I first get in the shower and the water gets warm.  (Pour it close to the drain so you won&#x27;t get cold water splashing on you-  yowsah!)  Then I shower with a cooler water.  It only takes one quick swipe with the squeegie to clear any water off the surface.  By the time I&#x27;m ready to shave it&#x27;s still crystal clear.   The shelf is handy, too.  The thing seems to be mounted quite securely... so far no inkling that it will fall off the shower wall.  Get this product if you want to shave in the shower or otherwise groom yourself with mirror assistance.</li>
    <li> This is one of the products that you hope actually work, and it works PERFECTLY. I could not be happier with this product. The glue actually holds it to the wall. The mirror actually never fogs. Great, great product.</li>
    <li> It really works as expected. It doesn&#x27;t fog and it is easy to use and install. Been using it for a few months now and has made it much easier to shave in the shower.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased several other \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; shower mirrors and they all fail in comparison to this product. It works exactly how it is described. I thought it was going to be a pain, having to fill and empty the water, but it turned out to be much easier than I expected. If you&#x27;re having trouble trying to decide on a shower mirror, search no further!!!!!</li>
    <li> After going through several cheap but costly mirrors, I have finally found the one my husband LOVES.  This one is the best and has a great price too!</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Mounting with the removal adhesive is great.  Very simple for sure no fog.</li>
    <li> With 300+ positive reviews already published, I have little new to add pertaining to the performance of this mirror; it works precisely as advertised. Installation (and later, removal) are quite easy and requires no additional tools or materials other than those provided. The mirror never falls, and as long as its reservoir is filled with shower-temp water it will not fog.    I am pleased to report that ToiletTree&#x27;s customer service matches the performance of their product. I&#x27;d owned the mirror for several months when it came time for me to change apartments. I browsed the product forum on Amazon just looking for removal tips (incidentally, simply wedging in a putty knife and separating the mirror from its silicone adhesive works perfectly), and read a company representative&#x27;s post stating that if needed they would mail users mounting materials, free, if requested. Duly I emailed such a request, and 3 days later received in the mail, at my new apartment, a packet with a fresh tube of silicone, double-sided tape, and a handwritten (!) note wishing me good luck with my move. I mean, that&#x27;s pretty outstanding. Applause, ToiletTree.</li>
    <li> This works exactly as described.  I thought the $30 price was a bit steep, but the product itself lives up to its billing.  Has made shaving in the shower my new way to shave.</li>
    <li> I have reservations about any product that makes an absolute claim like this one does. While It is true that the fogging can be reduced or eliminated by filling the reservoir with warm water however, I can hardly see through the water spots no matter how I clean the mirrors surface. Save your money and buy flowers for your honey!</li>
    <li> This mirror works great, if you follow the instructions it will never fog up and I am never worried about it falling down.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving in the shower for over 20 years now, and have tried several shower mirrors with varying results.  This product, without a doubt, is the best solution I have encountered.  The best solution to a problem is always the simplest, and this is a simple solution.  It takes no time at all to fill the reservoir with hot water, and then the fog disappears.  The image is fine for my shaving needs.  The item is light and attached very securely so I don&#x27;t worry about the mirror falling off the wall, like my last mirror did (repeatedly) when the suction cups lost their effectiveness.  This is highly recommended!</li>
    <li> First I would like to say this is a great fogless mirror. I have been using it for over a year now and very happy with it. However about a month ago the mirror began have trouble holding it&#x27;s position when it was filled with water. Now it cannot hold it&#x27;s position at all. It slumps over under the weight. A more minor issue is the squeegee also seems to be less effective in getting water off the mirror as it was when I first bought it. I plan to contact the company directly about both these issues to see if the parts can be replaced. They seem to have great customer service from other reviews.</li>
    <li> Works great! DH can \\&quot;see the side of his face to get the sideburns straight.\\&quot; Doesn&#x27;t fog.  Drilled a small hole in the bottom so it would self-drain. This is big improvement over the 3 other shower mirrors he tried.</li>
    <li> After years of using a \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; mirror that had all the clarity of mud, I have seen the light!  This product is the best--and so simple that it shows what a clever mind can create.  If you&#x27;ve been irritated by other mirrors, get this one ASAP.  You&#x27;ll not regret it.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the reviews.  I basically thought wow.. if 284 people gave it 5 stars has to be something to it... AND I WAS RIGHT!..  Its so creepy.. it doesn&#x27;t fog!  Even if you try and fog it yourself with your breathe.. won&#x27;t work!  Love this... HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</li>
    <li> We just had our tub re-glazed. I was worried about our existing suction cup mirror falling and scratching the tub. The old mirror also fogged up all of the time and we had to smear soap on it when we wanted to use it.    I purchased this new mirror mainly because it is not supposed to fall. The other features were interesting but I didn&#x27;t really appreciate them until I started using it. I put the bracket up according to the instructions - not difficult at all. The bracket and the mirror are rock solid so I am not worried about them falling.    I like that this mirror is a little bit larger, and can be angled up or down a few degrees as needed. You fill a space behind the mirror with water and that is supposed to keep it from fogging up. Seems to work as described. There is also a shelf that I have found to be very convenient. I take my glasses into the shower so I can clean them every day, and the shelf is a good place for them.    The mirror and bracket/shelf stick out from the wall a few inches (more than my suction cup mirror). I thought this would be a problem but so far, so good. Keep this in mind when you put the mirror up in your own shower.</li>
    <li> This mirror really does stay fogless in the shower!  My husband loves being able to shave in the shower and I love the new lack of whiskers in the bathroom sink.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this fogless mirror the last few months and it has been great. It has never fallen off the wall despite being bumped a few times and it doesn&#x27;t fog up during a shave. I highly recommend this fogless mirror.</li>
    <li> We love this mirror. It is truly Fogless and makes shaving and other tasks so much easier. A must have product.</li>
    <li> I like how this product works without suction cups that fall off, has a fantastic built-in shelf -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why we love it:&lt;br /&gt;1) Easy shaving - Greg loves it because his facial hair is able to soften up a bit in the shower. He uses the fogless mirror to shave, and then rinses off shaving cream under the shower.&lt;br /&gt;2) A mirror to see myself in - I love that I can actually see my face up close in the mirror! I wear glasses, so when I take them off to tweeze, I can&#x27;t see my face in the mirror above the sink. With the fogless mirror I can, though!&lt;br /&gt;3) The mirror is adjustable - You can move it up and down on a vertical pivot. This is great because Greg and I are two very different heights.&lt;br /&gt;4) Shelf included - There is a little shelf where you can put your tweezers and razor so everything is neatly in one spot.&lt;br /&gt;Other great features:&lt;br /&gt;-includes built-in spot for squeegee&lt;br /&gt;-it will not fall off the wall</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and reseached many products - bought this one 6 weeks ago and it doesn&#x27;t disappoint! We have it attached to our tiles (across two tiles); the stickers attached it at first until the silicon dried (I used a medium-small amount) and it&#x27;s really sturdy. I wiped it down with some Windex initially, and wipe it every 2 or 3 showers; no water marks (and we&#x27;re in hard water territory). Squeegee is great; shelf fits two razors; mirror comes off for easy filling from shower head. It&#x27;s great! And - my husband noted - if we ever need to replace the mirror part, we can keep the base on and simply buy a new one and replace without removing the base.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a few weeks now and agree with many of the reviews of this product.  It was easy to install and didn&#x27;t take long.  Like many others, I used all the silicone that came with it.  My initial instinct was to only use enough to fill the troughs on the back of it but I decided to use it all, seeing no harm in doing so.  So far, it&#x27;s not budged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fogless feature works exactly as advertised.  When my shower is nice and hot I life the mirror from the holder, fill it with hot shower water, give it a quick squeegee using the squeegee that lives underneath the razor shelf and it stays fog free for the remainder of my shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t comment on longevity but so far it seems like a well made and well thought out product.</li>
    <li> Very best Quality and customer Service Perfect For using in Bathroom when you are shaving</li>
    <li> This is such a wonderful invention! My husband always shaves and brushes his teeth in the shower. Sometimes when he gets out of the shower I notice that he&#x27;s missed a spot while shaving. Now with the Fogless Shower Mirror my sweet hubby never misses a spot while shaving. My hubby really liked how easy it was to install the mirror and he said that it never fogs up. He also likes that it pivots and it has a shelf.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve all experienced products that claim to be one thing but don&#x27;t turn out as expected. The ToiletTree Fogless Shower Mirror was not one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Installation steps were easy to follow with the adhesive and the double stick tape. Wait 24 hours for the adhesive to dry and you&#x27;re ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as you start showering, make sure you fill the reservoir cup with hot water to prevent the fogging. The fog prevention is done by raising the temp of the mirror with the temp of the air (like when you roll down your car windows to defog your windshield). It&#x27;s nice that it isn&#x27;t using a coating or any chemicals because those can peel or fade away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The squeegee works perfectly to help clear off the drops of water and stores conveniently in the little shelf so you don&#x27;t have to find it among your shampoo bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the ToiletTree Fogless Shower Mirror gives you exactly what it should - a mirror that doesn&#x27;t fog up in the shower.</li>
    <li> I used to have the kind of mirror that connected to the actual pipe on the shower head.  This was much easier to install, and I can place the mirror in a much better spot for shaving.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a shower shaver for years and have tried lots of systems, and this beats them all, hands down!  It has a wide and large view and never fogs up. The tilt mirror is a nice feature as well.    You have to mount it both with silicone and adhesive tape, which is included, so it&#x27;s not something that is meant to be moved around a lot.  This product is well thought out and recommended as one of the best shower shaver mirrors out there.</li>
    <li> Received the product in a timely manner. Was easy to install and works just as advertised. I haven&#x27;t had the mirror fog up on me yet and have been using it over a week now.</li>
    <li> I looked high and low for a decent fogless shower mirror for my husband that wouldn&#x27;t \\&quot;break the bank\\&quot;. I ordered this mirror and received it within a couple of days- quick service and intact.     The ToiletTree Mirror is hung in our shower and has been worth its weight in gold so far! My husband has had a clear, fog-free mirror to use while he shaves in the shower. It has been less than one week since the mirror has been hung, but with the two-sided tape/silicone combination (to adhere it to our shower wall), and it is still hanging tight!     Thank you for offering a quality product! We appreciate it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve gone through at least one of the cheap worthless mirrors that fog up no matter what you do to prevent it. Well the best new concept is placing hot water behind the mirror to stop condensation and is the only designed on the market now I&#x27;ve found to effectively work. So after lengthy research of product reviews for the available shower mirrors, I was able to narrow my search down to the Ace shower mirror ($15) and the ToiletTree shower mirror ($30). Both use the same water reservoir design.     Here&#x27;s how Ace Shower Mirror compares:   Pros of Ace Shower Mirror:   -doesn&#x27;t fog   -half the price of Toilet Tree&#x27;s product   -can be found at Target as well as Amazon     MAJOR CON of Ace Shower Mirror:   -Many customers complain about it falling off the wall because of the cheap suction cup design     Well, ToiletTree solved this major flaw and provides two square adhesives and a tube of super-special glue to place around the back of the mirror holder. This was the selling point for me, but I was concerned about not being able to move the mirror to my new apartment in a month. So I emailed their customer service asking if I could find this similar adhesive in a local store. I got a prompt response from Kelly the service rep and she let me know that it&#x27;s not a problem and she can mail me new adhesives free of charge. Fast forward a few days-I received a package in the mail with what she promised-and a hand-written card! I can&#x27;t comment on how easy it is to remove yet, but the website states that it does not ruin surfaces.     OVERALL: an excellent product that does what it says with excellent customer service to back it up. Such an easy formula for a successful product but so many companies fail to do these two things. Some things I would look forward to seeing in an improved version, but still minor, a slightly larger sized mirror and some sort of waterproof light as proper lighting makes a huge difference if there&#x27;s not much light in your shower. End of rant - now stop reading and go get one!!</li>
    <li> Like many others, I have tried several different \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; shower mirrors with mixed results.  Most have been disappointing.  This one, however has been absolutely perfect.  It performs as advertised.  I fill it up with hot water from the shower at the beginning of my shower each morning, and have enjoyed two weeks of completely fog-free shaving.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Installation is a snap, and mirror is very clear.  Great product and worth the money.</li>
    <li> I ordered this mirror in frustration, right after our existing \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; shower mirror fell off the shower wall for what felt like the hundredth time and woke my sleeping 3-month-old from a nap. My husband loves to shave in the shower, but I didn&#x27;t believe there was any mirror on the market that would actually work as advertised. Amazingly, this mirror really does live up to its description! It is truly fogless (every other \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; mirror I&#x27;ve met hasn&#x27;t been), cleverly designed, and easy to use. Best of all, it stays where it&#x27;s supposed to!</li>
    <li> I recently remodeled my bathroom and bought this fogless mirror.  Given the price I was skeptical that it would well, look good and not detract from my beautiful new bathroom. I was very pleasantly surprised and just bought another one for a Christmas gift.</li>
    <li> When I knew I wanted to start shaving my beard in the shower, the next thing was finding a mirror.  I had no idea there were so many different types and features, so I began doing some research to avoid wasting money and found most of them had condemning reviews.  They either weren&#x27;t fog-free (except for the first few uses until the fog spray wore off the mirror), they constantly fell off the shower wall (usually due to the use of suction cups) and were made with cheap quality.      I found that to be true except with the reviews with this product, so I put it to the test.  I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 3 months and it&#x27;s everything it&#x27;s made out to be.  It&#x27;s never fallen from it&#x27;s adhesion and, best of all, its clever design makes it 100% fog-free without any spray on junk.  The price difference from this product and others is minimal and it&#x27;s far worth the investment!    I&#x27;m very pleased with the product and would highly recommend it to anyone interested in the benefits of shaving in the shower.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually take time to leave reviews; but this is an excellent product.  I&#x27;ve used fog-less mirrors in the shower before, and I love them; but this is the best so far.  Silicone adhesive is far superior to suction cup mounts...no crashing to the floor in the middle of the night and much more convenient than the kind that permanently attach to the shower head; those weren&#x27;t on option in my case anyway....stone walls in my shower don&#x27;t provide a smooth enough surface for suction cups and the flexible hand-held shower head doesn&#x27;t allow any kind of attachments there.  The mirror is a generous size, provides a small shelf to hold my razor and the crowning touch in the perfectly sized squeegee that allow you to clean the mirror with one swipe and then conveniently store the squeegee in the handy slot on the bottom of the mounting bracket. Oh, and it tilts, allowing you even more flexibility in your choice of where to mount it...or for people of different heights to use it.  Love this mirror</li>
    <li> This is perfect for guys who like to shave in the shower... if done right, it will not fall off</li>
    <li> We cannot get this to stay on our glass shower wall! It falls off leaving the glue on the glass and I having to scrap it off. We found a cheap one at Target and are now using that. Wish this worked because my husband really liked the look of this one.</li>
    <li> Does everything it says it does! Doesn&#x27;t fog up even if the water isn&#x27;t as warm as my shower water (I like to up the temperature as my shower goes on.) I don&#x27;t mind the mirror being a little distorted. It is definitely not a mirror made of glass, but it reflects without being fogged up and that&#x27;s all I care about.     Hopefully removing the mirror stand when I move goes well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to increase the number of 5-star reviews by one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like it&#x27;s a rare experience for me to order something where it installation is well-documented and easy, and it works as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most products suction cups, which I consider something to avoid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) They usually won&#x27;t work on textured tiles (like ours) due to uneven surface.&lt;br /&gt;2) They tend to pop-off periodically and eventually they just fail completely&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product uses a silicone adhesive.  (There are sticky tabs, but they are only to hold it in place while the adhesive cures.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror simply does NOT fog and the reason is because it uses a very simple reliable method: you fill a tub behind the mirror with heated water from the shower and thus, there is no mismatch in temperature between the mirror and the humid air, which is what causes fog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product comes with a squeegee to wipe drops off the mirror and to keep it clean (instructions warn against using household cleaners) and my experience has been that the mirror stays clean so long as you wipe it down each time and thus avoid dried water droplets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror also pivots so you can mount it high and aim it down, or mount it low and aim it up, and of course, that accommodates people of different height.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that I can cut 10 minutes out of my VERY busy morning routine just by shaving in the shower.  I also get a better shave because my beard has been softened by the warm water, and of course rinsing the lather off your face is more convenient in a shower than a sink.  Of course, you use FAR more hot water if you do it in a shower, but I just turn the water off while I shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this thing.  I suspect it makes a great gift.</li>
    <li> This mirror stays on the wall.&lt;br /&gt;You add water to the slit on top of the mirror (equal to the temperature of your shower), and it works wonders. This mirror does not fog up if you do as advised.</li>
    <li> I had been looking around for a while for a fogless mirror, and they either didn&#x27;t work, or were much too expensive.  The Fogless Shower Mirror by ToiletTree was the right price, and I can say I am ecstatic about this product.  Everything about this is amazing.  Simple setup, strong product once installed, no fog, easy use, everything you are looking for and more.  Also very easy to use even if you have a little bit of &#x27;user error&#x27;.  There have been a couple of times that I have forgotten to change to water before my shower, but I just fill it back up, use the squeegee, and I am good in 5 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A wonderful product that I would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> It was easy to install, and even easier to use. It remains spotless thanks to the mini-squeegee that&#x27;s included. Low tech! The best purchase so far this year.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband as a gift for Father&#x27;s Day.  This is at least the 3rd \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; mirror we&#x27;ve tried.  He has been using it now for a couple of weeks, and he says it works perfectly.  It doesn&#x27;t take a lot of time or trouble to fill it with warm water and it remains fog-free for the duration of his shower.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s something to be said for this product&#x27;s simplicity. Gotta love science.  No wierd chemicals or special sprays needed.  Just fill the mirror up and you&#x27;re good to go. Great present for anyone who multitasks in the shower.</li>
    <li> One of my all time favorite products. I absolutely love this thing. Use it EVERY day to shave.</li>
    <li> Husband says this is the best shower shaving mirror he&#x27;s ever had. It does not have the suction cups which often slide, rather, it attaches easily to the shower wall. It does not fog and he likes the squeegee which cleans it off nicely. Good product. Good delivery service.</li>
    <li> We got this product back in October and I keep forgetting to write a review - so here I am finally. I got this for my husband and he loves it! He would always shave in front of the sink until he got this mirror - now he shaves in the shower. The fogless mirror truly works! And it&#x27;s easy to install in the shower. Thanks for a great product.</li>
    <li> I have never written a review about any products before because I never felt the need. However, when I bought this mirror I read many reviews and was still a little skeptical, but hopeful. I have used it for at least a month now and feel compelled to write a quick review.    This mirror is awesome! I have had several so-called fogless mirrors in the past and this is the ONLY one that I have ever had that really works!!! Forget about the idiotic reviews by some that claim it is junk and doesn&#x27;t work or is made cheaply - some people will complain about anything! I have even tested it and ran my shower on the hottest that it would go with tons of steam and it still didn&#x27;t fog up...The mirror is clear and not distorted at all like some have claimed. I modified mine slightly and cut off the bottom little shelf which I didn&#x27;t need. It now looks cleaner and I threw out the little squeegee - it wasn&#x27;t needed...    Trust me - Look no further than this mirror if you are in the market for a fogless mirror!!!!</li>
    <li> Mirror is exactly what I was looking for.  Easy to use and take 5 seconds yo fill with water before using.</li>
    <li> This is my 4th \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; shower mirror, but this is the only one to live up to the claims made.  Most are cheaply made and the chemical that keeps them \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; is marginal at best and has to be reapplied over time.  The science behind this product is simple...if you keep the mirror at a temperature close to the air inside the shower it won&#x27;t fog up.  You do have to use the included glue to attach the mirror to our shower wall, but I was happy to do so for a product that works this well.  It has been several months and I am very happy with this purchase</li>
    <li> Before purchasing the Fogless Shower Mirror by ToiletTree product for my husband, he was either constantly cutting himself while trying to shave in the shower or rushing to shave himself at the bathroom sink and still cutting himself because he was in such a rush.  He loves this product and it truly works like it promises. It does not fog and took only a few minutes to install. The item arrived on-time. I will definitely consider purchasing from this seller again. My husband loves it!</li>
    <li> If you put water in the mirror as instructed, it will stay fog free. I like the looks of the mirror, also. Clean and sharp design. Some complain that it&#x27;s plastic but what isn&#x27;t these days. The one I originally received had a bit of the distorted, fun house look to it. I e-mailed Toilet Tree and they quickly sent me a new one. Their customer service seems to be  really good. Be sure to use all the silicone to attach it. An improvement, in my opinion, would be a small removable plug to let the water out when done with the mirror. It could be attached to the mirror so as not to get lost. Like a few others reviewing here, I drilled a very tiny hole in the bottom of the reservoir The water drips out slowly and is empty by the time I use it again the next day. I use a plastic cup to fill it and never take it off the wall, now. The squeegee is not of much use to me. I take my towel and gently wipe the mirror surface with it to remove the water when I&#x27;m done. Comes out spotless. I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed if you purchase this.</li>
    <li> The only thing that I can tell you is that I have been buying \\&quot;fogless mirrors\\&quot; for shaving in the shower for 20 years.  Some worked for a couple of days, some a couple of weeks.  This thing, simple in its design, is a miracle.  Fill it with water, 10 seconds, squigee it, 5 seconds and you have a perfectly clear mirror that does not fog.  It is cool.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this mirror!  First fogless shower mirror that actually works.  Brilliant design.  Great job!  Very highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I was just looking for a shower mirror (for shaving), and I have previously tried the ones that hold up with suction cups. Those don&#x27;t work very well, they will fall down eventually, and they do fog up.    This one works a bit differently, it&#x27;s held up with silicon and adhesive tape. It holds hot water inside of it so it actually doesn&#x27;t fog. I find that the squeegee is useless, but other than that the mirror lets me shave in the shower without issue.    Here are my thoughts summed up:    - Doesn&#x27;t fog  - Setup is easy  - Hasn&#x27;t fell down (yet)  - Squeegee is a useless bonus</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift, so I don&#x27;t have any personal experience. The person I gave it to seems to like it very much.</li>
    <li> After testing out my fair share of \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; mirrors, I was skeptical this product could do the job. But I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised and extremely happy by the performance. No fog at all, thanks to the innovative anti-fog feature behind the mirror. If you&#x27;re in the market for a fogless mirror, this is THE one to buy.</li>
    <li> My husband decided that he wanted to start shaving in the shower so I did my research on Amazon for the best option for a shower shaving mirror.  This one by far had the best ratings and this is what we went with.  He has been very happy with this product and we have had it for about a month now.</li>
    <li> This mirror is perfect.  Stays fogless by adding warm shower water into the reservoir behind the mirror. Husband loves it!</li>
    <li> What else could be a better review for a product than \\&quot;It Works\\&quot;. This product does everything it says it is going to do. Enough said.</li>
    <li> Toilet Tree has a winner in this fog-less mirror made for the shower-although presumably it could used about a basin which would be filled with hot water. Easy to apply to a wall in the shower, it&#x27;s cleverly thought out so the two pieces not attached are not going to fall down. The mirror, which is filled with warm to hot water, slides easily into an easy to use U shaped mounting and the squeegee( yes, a real squeegee to clean the mirror from water) slides into a thoughtfully placed container in the front of the piece. The mirror adjusts up and down so it&#x27;s not just for one person (I&#x27;m six five and people as short as 5&#x27; 8\\&quot; say it rotates down to make it easy for them to effectively use.) Unlike similar mirrors, there&#x27;s no need to do plumbing to keep it clear, just the one fill up does the trick and that lasts for a long time. The water container behind the non-breakable mirror is sufficiently insulated so that the heat doesn&#x27;t quickly diminish. I shave both my head and my face and using this product not only is of a great help to me but, I believe, assists in getting a better shave.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend really loves this mirror. It never fogs and was very easy to hang &amp; also easy to clean</li>
    <li> This product works!  Most others don&#x27;t.  I have purchased many shower mirrors and all of them have fallen and eventually fogged up.  This mirror stays put and never fogs.  I would recommend this product to anyone who is fed up with mirrors that don&#x27;t work and would like one that really works!</li>
    <li> I got this mirror as a present for my husband&#x27;s birthday. Prior to this one he had a mirror-radio combo, and that mirror fogged up after a few weeks of installation, and the image wasn&#x27;t of great quality in the first place. Plus the radio stopped working a few months ago. So I decided, after having read all the reviews, that I would get him this mirror instead. GREAT choice!!! Having tried it out the morning after he put it up, my husband (otherwise not an enthusiastic fellow) came out raving about it. He said \\&quot;This mirror is like going from a regular TV to an HD.\\&quot; He is SO right! The image is wonderful, and the mirror doesn&#x27;t fog up.  One little thing: For us the silicone adhesive didn&#x27;t work (the mirror fell off...), so we used Liquid Nail instead. But this is a minor thing compared to how awesome this product is. Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Good product...works as advertised &amp; very convenient! Product information and instructions supplied made it a snap to install and use. Recommended!</li>
    <li> The set-up of the fogless shower mirror was extremely easy and effortless.  The mirror works as advertised if you follow directions.  Practical and fogless.</li>
    <li> This is pretty cool. I got it for my husband who kept nicking his face off in the shower. He seems to like it since he uses it everyday. It doesn&#x27;t fog either so if you&#x27;re looking for a way to not slice your face off in the morning, this is it.</li>
    <li> Works better than any fog less mirror and I have tried many. If you shave in the shower this is the one.</li>
    <li> With all of the positive reviews already provided, it seems redundant to provide another one, but so few products work like they&#x27;re supposed to work that I feel compelled to praise this one.  The mirror was delivered quickly; it was simple to install and it&#x27;s worked like a charm.  Previously, I&#x27;ve tried several suction cup devices, but because my shower tile has a very subtle texture to it, the cups did not hold, plus the mirrors always fogged up.  My shower tile looks smooth and flat, but there is enough texture to it to prevent a long-lasting hold.  The silicone adhesive provided with this product is very strong and I am confident that the mirror and mount will hold fast for many years.  One of the reviewers discovered that there is no need to empty the reservoir every day.  He simply poured warm shower water into the previously filled reservoir.  The newly-added warm water displaces the left-over cold water and the mirror remains fog free.  I tried it and it works very nicely.  This way I do not have to physically remove the mirror from its mount and empty it.  How lazy is that?      Great product and well worth the price!</li>
    <li> Works exactly as designed.  I would recommend this product to anyone who wants a mirror that does not fog.  Emptying and filling the mirror takes about 6 seconds so it is not a time consuming process.</li>
    <li> It works fine like the other hundreds of reviews say.  I have a little corner shelf in my shower about face height.  I set the mirror on the shelf.  It&#x27;s got a little base that it connects to and it sits fine on the shelf.  It didn&#x27;t fog when filled with water but it would be too top heavy with water set up as I described.  I leave it empty and it fogs up but right before I shave I spray water on it and it stays unfogged for plenty of time to shave.  Good product.</li>
    <li> The mirror is truly fogless and clear. As soon as you add water to it, it becomes clear. Just the droplets of water remain, but a quick swipe with the included squeegee and it is very clear.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror for my son. He has said that he is very happy with it and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully! My BF really appreciated this gift. Now he has less stress shaving in the shower in the a.m. while getting ready for work.</li>
    <li> I have owned numerous brands of \\&quot;fog free\\&quot; shower mirrors.  This is the best I have owned. I don&#x27;t have to worry about it slipping off of the shower wall and it stays clear throughout my shave.</li>
    <li> The only place I shave is in the shower..I had the suction cup mirror for years and it would fall about once a month..it also would fog up..when I saw this advertised I decided to give it a shot with the great reviews I saw..It worked as advertised and I was very happy for about two weeks until the glue failed and down it went..the company contacted me after I wrote a review about this and sent me some more glue and tape to try again..It has not come down since..I suggest remembering to dump the water after each use as I think that was the \\&quot;downfall\\&quot;. It is a great product and the only way to shave!&lt;br /&gt;Jan 2013...No problems since I put it up again..I think the trick is to NEVER leave the water in and to dump it after each use.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because my cheap Walmart fogless mirror wasn&#x27;t fogless and since I couldn&#x27;t see anything in it while shaving I don&#x27;t think it counted as a mirror anymore.  I was a little concerned about glueing something to the tile but it was extremely easy and feels very sturdy. The mirror is nice and large and totally fogless. I can stand in the middle of the shower and still see myself perfectly which is really helpful since I&#x27;m mildly far-sighted. Very pleased with this product.  *Update: Need to upgrade this review from 5 stars to 6 thanks to superior customer service  I was having some issues with hard water in my new apartment and it was causing some crusting on my mirror. I decided to try emailing the company. Here is what I wrote:  My only problem is that I moved to an apartment with extremely hard water. Apparently the town is actually known for its hard water. Even rinsing the mirror after each use I&#x27;m still noticing a lot of sediment buildup. If i gently scrap it off with a fingernail I can clean it somewhat for a few weeks but it keeps coming back. Is there anything I can use to clean the surface that will dissolve some of the minerals but not destroy the coating on the mirror?  Here is the response I got 10 MINUTES LATER!:  We have had some customers complain about the issue of hard water and have come up with some solutions. For initially cleaning the water spotting off, we recommend taking white vinegar and letting it sit on the mirror surface for a few minutes. Once you wipe the vinegar away, you should have a clear mirror. Then, to avoid future build up, we recommend using either car or boat wax and applying a thin layer of it to the mirror surface which helps repel the water spots from occurring.  I hope these tips are able to help you. If by any chance, your mirror still does not become clear, please let me know and I will be happy to send you out a replacement mirror. Please let me know if you have any other questions!  I am honestly stunned by how fast and helpful the response was. Great customer service for a product I was already happy with.</li>
    <li> MY HUSBAND IS IN LOVE WITH THIS MIRROR, AND UNLIKE OTHERS HE HAS HAD IT REALLY DOES NOT FOG UP WHEN USED AS DIRECTED.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mirror after trying another less expensive, suction cup style mirror. That mirror lasted all of 1 week before it fell and the cheap plastic cracked. This fogless mirror by Toilet Tree, is excellent. It uses silicone to attach the mirror to the wall, which has worked great so far. The mirror is adjustable, it tilts forward or back, which is nice. It also remains fog free as advertised. All in all, I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> company sent a new one. thanks for the excellent customer service. I highly suggest buying a mirror from Toilettree. I will be buying more.</li>
    <li> Just received this mirror. It lives up to it&#x27;s promise.  It looks nice in the shower and is easy to install/use.  We like that it is ajustable so both my husband and I can use it.  Very happy with it and plan on getting more for gifts.</li>
    <li> I now have the mirror installed, and it works beautifully.  I like it so much I&#x27;m getting one for my dad for this Father&#x27;s Day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great design: after years of trying different mirrors that supposedly came with some anti-fog coating, here&#x27;s something that solves the problem once and for all.  I see what others are saying about a bit of distortion, and yes, there is some slight distortion, but it&#x27;s far better than any other shaving mirror I&#x27;ve encountered and doesn&#x27;t bother me in the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even better, they have great customer service.  I happened to be unlucky and get a box that didn&#x27;t come with silicone sealant.  When I called the next morning, a real person who spoke English picked up on pretty much the first ring, very competently understood what my problem was and what was needed to fix it.  In a few days, I received a new tube of silicone sealant in my mailbox!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note about where to affix the mirror: put it in the back of the shower *away* from the showerhead.  If you put it near the front, you&#x27;ll get sprayed in the face every time you try to use the mirror.  It&#x27;s possible to move the mirror after it&#x27;s been affixed, but a lot of work involving a good deal of scraping, since that silicone sealant is really quite effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Update 21 Jan 2014] After a few years, it actually fell after the sealant failed!  I didn&#x27;t hesitate before buying a brand new version of the exact same thing.  This one came with the sealant, and is working perfectly. [/End Update]</li>
    <li> After purchasing and throwing away countless \\&quot;fog free\\&quot; mirrors over the years, I was about ready to give up on the idea that such a thing really existed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after receiving my Fogless Shower Mirror by ToiletTree, I&#x27;m a believer!  This thing does exactly what the manufacturer say it does!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend this product highly enough.  If you shave in the shower and need a top notch truly fogless mirror, then this is the one.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent shower mirror and well worth the money. My husband has been in search of a fogless shower mirror that acutally works and this one is right on the money. It is worth the money spent and you will save yourself in the long run because you won&#x27;t need to buy more than one mirror to find one that works. It attaches securely to the wall and doesn&#x27;t use suction cups so you don&#x27;t need to worry about it falling off of the wall. By filling the back with hot water you eliminate the fogging and it provides the perfect reflection you need to shave. Looks great and doesn&#x27;t feel cheap. My husband loves it!</li>
    <li> The Good:&lt;br /&gt;- does not fog when used properly&lt;br /&gt;- adjustable angle is nice&lt;br /&gt;- easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;- shaving in the shower seems to result in a much better shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;- manually removing the mirror and refilling with water each time is a slight inconvenience&lt;br /&gt;- the parts involved in the pivot motion wear down over time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve become spoiled. Shaving in the shower is the only way to go. I&#x27;ve always gotten a much better shave in the steamy shower than by standing in front of a sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for everyday shaving at home, this product is the one to have. While I liked the convenience of the shower-head-mounted type which I had used for many years, I&#x27;ve come to like this product better. Unlike the shower-head-mounted type, this one doesn&#x27;t receive a continuous feed of warm water from the shower head into the mirror, which is actually a disadvantage of this one in my view.  That shower-head-mounted type meant no constant refilling of a water reservoir with warm water.  On the other hand, this reservoir type is easier to remove and clean, can be mounted practically anywhere in the shower, and doesn&#x27;t introduce a water connection that is prone to leakage or random directional offspray from any number of places on the shower-head-mounted type mirrors as those units are under constant water pressure while in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only product improvement I&#x27;d recommend for a future version of this would be something like a small release hatch/gate at bottom that would allow one to release the water after using, without having to unhook the mirror, dump, and re-hook. Re-hooking is pretty effortless in itself, but I often mess up the optimum downward angle when re-attaching the unit and find myself constantly having to readjust the pitch as a result. And constant re-adjustment means wear and tear on those plastic parts which hold the proper angle.  If I could pop open a relief valve at the bottom of the unit with a flick of a finger before exiting the shower, I&#x27;d keep a beaker type cup on the shower shelf and use it to refill the mirror with fresh, hot water next time I entered the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the mirror is well-worth the money given the frequency of at-home shaving we guys do and the smooth, comfortable results of shaving in the shower.h a flick of a finger before exiting the shower, I&#x27;d keep a beaker type cup on the shower shelf and use it to refill the mirror with fresh, hot water next time I entered the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the mirror is well-worth the money given the frequency of at-home shaving we guys do and the smooth, comfortable results of shaving in the shower.</li>
    <li> I deleted my previous post. There was an issue with the mirror and the company stands behind their product. They exceed customer satisfaction. Thanks, Brad</li>
    <li> A fogless mirror for the shower...is there really such a thing? I was presented with the idea of this when I saw this new product. I received one and put it up in our shower to test it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Fogless Mirror is easily installed with a few double sided pieces of foam tape and some silicone adhesive. Make sure it is straight and at the right height and stick it to the wall. The surface of the mirror measures aprox. 6\\&quot;x8\\&quot; and has a little shelf to store the squeegee as well as a razor or two. The mirror slides on and off of the platform for easy use and filling with warm water. In order to keep the mirror fogless you fill the back of it with your warm shower water and away you go. The mirror sits on an adjustable platform that pivots up and down in about three or four different positions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For any man who shaves in the shower this is a great gift. They no longer have to shave blind or continually wipe off a mirror to see what they are doing. I am sure there are a hundred other things that this mirror could be used for as well. It is a great invention that actually stays fog free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another idea is to place it at your kids eye level in the tub and let them have fun with it while taking a bath or shower. Kids enjoy seeing themselves. It may actually help your kids wash their hair properly and get all of the soap out!!</li>
    <li> We didn&#x27;t open yet this product, because it&#x27;s one of Christmas present.. it&#x27;s still under the Tree :)....  I&#x27;ll be able to update later.</li>
    <li> I have shaved in the shower for 22 years, trying almost every mirror available.  This is the BEST of them all. Do not wast your money on anything else.</li>
    <li> I received this mirror as a gift and realized immediately how much smoother my shave felt being able to utilize the steam in the shower. The mirror is completely fogless. Not only do I get a better shave I save a ton of time in the morning. My fiancé also uses the mirror to tweeze her eyebrows and finds it makes that task much easier as well. I think I have found a great gift to send out to the family this Christmas!! I highly recommend this mirror!!</li>
    <li> I have ordered, and thrown away many fogless mirrors. This is the first one that has worked and I paid way less then others that did not.  I highly recommend this mirror for your shower!</li>
    <li> I have purchased at least 5 different \\&quot;Fogless\\&quot; mirror&#x27;s.  I recived this one as a groomsman gift.  I hvae been using it now for several weeks and it have been perfect.  Not only has it not fogged at all but has maitained to be very clear.  This is a great product, I would recommend this to anyone that shaves in the shower!</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical of something you had to &#x27;fill with water&#x27; each time. Wow, this thing is neat. I&#x27;ve struggled on two different purchases with the \\&quot;Z\\&quot; company&#x27;s brand as it was the only alternative out there...not any more. I am a lifelong shower/shaver and this thing is awesome. Wish it had a clock is all I may add but won&#x27;t take away from the 5 stars, be a great spot on the base for it.</li>
    <li> I bought this in combo with the shower breeze [[ASIN:B000CEMWHI ShowerBreeze W/ 3&#x27; Hose Oral Irrigator]]. Now we can see where to aim the water flosser! They really mean NO FOG! Wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I definitely recommend this mirror. It really does stay fogless if you put warm water in it. And the silicone adhesive is much stronger than suction cups would be. We love it!</li>
    <li> I am overall very happy with this product. It stays on the shower wall with no problem, the mirror is a decent size (though I think I&#x27;d prefer the size of the deluxe version but not for another $20), it stays fogless and is quick and easy to fill.  The little shelf for the razor is also very convenient. The only complaint I have is I started to notice white streaks all over the mirror that wouldn&#x27;t go away.  The instructions said not to use any glass cleaners or abrasive cleaners and to only use water and the included squeegee to clean. However, the water did nothing to remove the streaks.  So I went on their website and it said it&#x27;s probably due to hard water and to try using liquid car wax to clean it.  I did so and it worked well.  I know its not necessarly their fault, it&#x27;s a combo of the material and the hard water but I do have to make sure to stay stocked up on car wax now to keep it clean.  So all in all, a very good product that could be a little bigger and a little easier to clean.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror. I have not had a problem with it falling off, nor a problem with the quality of the mirror that others have stated. The only issue I&#x27;ve had is one that I&#x27;ve seen stated quite often in other reviews, and that is, upon arrival of the package, the silicone adhesive was completely dried up and hard as a rock. I had to go to the store and purchase my own. The squeegee that comes with it is pretty much useless as well, but I don&#x27;t have much of a problem with too much water getting on it given the placement of it in my shower. Other than that.. I love it!</li>
    <li> $30 for a shower mirror? I know, right?     But the fact of the matter is that I have spent well over $30 on many cheap mirrors that promised the world and failed immediately. Fogging up and crashing into the tub in the middle of the night, scaring the bejeebus out of me, is the norm.     This mirror, if used properly, WILL NOT FOG UP, and it WILL NOT FALL DOWN. If that&#x27;s worth $30 to you, grab this and you will be thrilled.     So why 4 stars and not 5? Well, $30 IS a lot of money for this. Looking at it, bases on materials and complexity, there&#x27;s really no compelling reason for the high price except that it&#x27;s the only thing of its kind on the market. If there were a legitimate competitor, the price would probably quickly be cut in half.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this mirror for about a month.   The good: It works. It stays fog free the whole time during my shave. The little shelf is nice and the squeegee is a great touch. The mounting is easy and seems very secure so far.   The OK: taking it on and off the mount to refill and empty is a bit of a pain. I hope the plastic stands up to this maneuver over time. The image on the mirror is a bit distorted and appears smaller than reality. This is not a dealbreaker as it&#x27;s certainly adequate to shave. It would be nice if there were an option for a light as my shower is a bit dark.  All in all, this met my expectations and hope it will have a long life.</li>
    <li> I have tried several mirrors and none of them work.  I even used to put the RainX Fog Free liquid on them and they still didn&#x27;t work.  I bought this one and it is amazing!  All you do is put warm/hot water in the resevoir tank and then it will stay fog free your entire shower!  It tells you to leave the water in it, but I just fill it up and then empty it, hang it back up and then use the squeegy they give you and it works great!  You won&#x27;t be dissapointed I promise you!</li>
    <li> Just add warm water and this product works great. be sure to pour out the cold and add warm every time you use or it will fog. I highly recommend</li>
    <li> This is the best shower mirror I have owned.  It does not fog up at all and is worth the $30!!!    Just know that once you put it up, it will be there for good, because it does use some adhesive</li>
    <li> Great fogless mirror... it is actually fogless. Not like the \\&quot;fogless mirrors\\&quot; you get at BBB or similar stores. Just been using it for a week now, but I am very satisfied with it.&lt;br /&gt;Amazing idea of using hot water between the mirror and the frame. I am recommending this product to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> I shave in the shower and can&#x27;t tell you how many \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; shaving mirrors I have purchased in the past. None remain fogless for more than two or three uses. This one really works! I read a few reviews before purchasing and was a little concerned about having to fill it with hot water with every use. That has turned into a non-issue because it doesn&#x27;t require much water and can be filled very quickly with water from the shower. I also like the way it connects to the wall. I don&#x27;t have to worry about suction cups losing their suction and the mirror falling in the middle of the night. It was very easy to install. I like this so much, I gave one as a Christmas present and plan to buy at least one more to give as a gift. My only quibble is that they don&#x27;t use a magnifying mirror.</li>
    <li> This mirror does what it says - it stays fog free as long as you follow the directions.  I especially appreciate the fact that the company seems to go out of it&#x27;s way to make sure you install and use it correctly, thereby avoiding any product support hassles.  It&#x27;s hands-down the best mirror I&#x27;ve used and I&#x27;ve gone through plenty.</li>
    <li> I have tried several fogless mirrors and this one is the very best.  Wouldn&#x27;t change anything.  Also received it very fast.  Totally satisfied with Amazon and the mirror.</li>
    <li> I Purchased this for my son as a present.  He did the shopping and read the reviews, and it lives up to the 5 stars.  The one person who says it doesn&#x27;t work, must not read instructions.  ( must be a man...haha)   It works great and easy to hang.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Overall I like this product and this may be one of the first Amazon reviews I have ever completed (out of hundreds of purchases). I was impressed by how easy the mirror was to install and it has definitely improved my in-shower shaving. It lives up to the claim that it \\&quot;will not fog\\&quot; (though i will caveat that water droplets collecting on the mirror may not be fog but they are just as effective at making it hard to see); however the \\&quot;designed not to fall\\&quot; claim has a bit of a flaw. The base of the mirror is definitely not going anywhere, short of a jackhammer I&#x27;m actually not sure how im going to get it down if i ever have to move. However, the mirror itself attaches to the base at 2 ratcheting points which allow the mirror to be angled up and down. This appears to be the product&#x27;s greatest weakness. A brush from an errant towel and the mirror comes crashing down into the tub (or onto the back of your ankle....youch!). All in all i would recommend the mirror, especially if you have a spacious shower, but it would be nice if the mirror was a bit more firmly secured to the base to prevent falling.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband. He has tried many mirrors for the shower that all say fig free. My husband is so happy this one is truly fog free!!!!!</li>
    <li> It actually works! I don&#x27;t know what else to say. You put in hot water at the start of your shower and the thing doesn&#x27;t fog. It&#x27;s easy to use and always works. I have no complaints whatsoever.</li>
    <li> I got this shower mirror as a Christmas gift, and it is excellent.  Fog free, very easy to hang, simple to refill with water.  It is a must have for those that prefer to shave in the shower.</li>
    <li> I love the mirror. It works well and the little squeejee conveniently tucks away in front of the razor tray. I wasn&#x27;t happy with where I placed the mirror and asked Toilettree how I can order another silicone packet. They sent me a replacement one along with the double-sided tape free of charge plus a handwritten note. I would order this again for future bathrooms without hesitation.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very lightweight (not glass), easy to install and stays fogless. The refill process is fast, takes less than a minute and I do it in the shower. I do forget to empty it after shower though but so far it didn&#x27;t cause any problems :-) The installation was very easy, the double-sided tape and silicon glue are included. After a couple of weeks I decided to move it to the right. I was able to remove it from the tile in less than a couple of minutes by using a knife, clean up was a breeze. There is enough silicon glue for a couple of installation, just need extra tape. The reflection is a little distorted but it&#x27;s expected with plastic mirrors. I wish it was a little bigger.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mirror for about 2 months now and I can&#x27;t fault it in any way. It&#x27;s the most simple of designs to fill a container behind the mirror with warm water, but as is often the case, the simplest designs prove to be the best.  The silicon adhesive is a great adition and really holds the mirror strong. I&#x27;ve forgotten to empty the water container multiple times, but the extra weight being left on the wall hasn&#x27;t caused any movement or slippage.</li>
    <li> i was pleased with this product however it still fogs up in the shower and you have to use the squeegee alot</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for over two months and it still works great. I never thought I&#x27;d come across a fogless mirror that actually did what is was supposed to after a few days. Finally a shower mirror worth buying...</li>
    <li> Good product..works very well. You have to fill up the reservoir each time you shower though. But the mirror is great to shave in the shower and not miss spots.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband in the hope of seeing him with sideburns that didn&#x27;t look like he should be on Star Trek.  He says he likes it &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;.  He may just be saying that.  He&#x27;s a polite man.  Our shower is a bit too nice (tiled) to stick anything to the wall with the enclosed gummy item; that&#x27;s why I purchased this one.  We have a little shelf.  Doesn&#x27;t it look like it could sit nicely on a little shelf?  Nope.  That photo is how it looks stuck to the wall.  It doesn&#x27;t stand up on that black bottom shown in the photo.  That&#x27;s simply a very cheap little plastic razor holder on the bottom of the mirror.  That was probably my mistake.  It is, however, appropriately fogless when filled with water. It is now sitting, without it&#x27;s little razor holder, leaning against the wall on the shelf.  I think I&#x27;ll leave it there for a little while longer and toss it.  I&#x27;ll look for another one more suitable to our needs.</li>
    <li> So great to buy a product that does exactly what it says it does and so well. No issues .</li>
    <li> This product works just as it&#x27;s advertised.  It was very easy to install and I was amazed at how clear the mirror was the first few times I used it in the shower.  The key, as explained in the instructions, is to make sure there&#x27;s hot water in the mirror reservoir, otherwise there will be fog.  I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and would recommend this product to anyone who&#x27;s struggling with a \\&quot;fog-free\\&quot; mirror that fogs up.</li>
    <li> Was a little reluctant to buy this mirror because it requires filling it up with warm water for it to work, but it actually is quick and easy to do and works incredibly well.  My old mirror was held on my suction cups and periodically fell down.  Also it fogged up fairly easy.  This one is held on by glue and has never fell in the year that i owned it.  It never fogs up either.  Looks really nice as well.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror for my husband. He lost all hope in a fogless mirror that actually works. I figured, for a bit more money, something would. I was pleasantly surprised to find that this product works perfectly and it doesn&#x27;t cost much more than the lame ones. We have had it for two months now. It&#x27;s well worth the price and it doesn&#x27;t require any batteries, just water! I&#x27;m now purchasing one as a gift for his friend.</li>
    <li> I love shaving in the shower.  I always do it that way, unless I am traveling.  I have purchased several supposedly fog-free mirrors over the years.  None of them worked!  I have had the kind you hook-up to the shower head, which connects to the water supply and trickles water down the back of the mirror, which is supposed to keep it fog-free, and it was nothing but trash.  I have had several you attach to the wall.  Those kind worked for about a week and then started to fog up.  I was so tired of having to take the hand held shower sprayer off the holder to wash the fog off the mirror.  I would have to do that several times while shaving and it was annoying (not much comes close to how annoying it was to have fog on a fog-free mirror).  I was also tired of having to clean the mirror to try and get all the water spots off of it, to no avail.  About five months ago I had finally had it with buying cheap fog-free mirrors that did not work.  I went onto Amazon.com to see if there were any truly fog-free mirrors available.  They all were just like the ones I had used before, except for this one.  I read all the great reviews on it and decided to give it a try.  After having it for about a week, I got a message from the seller inviting me to post a review of the product on Amazon.com.  I thought to myself, \\&quot;No way.  I have only had this for a week and based on my experience with these types of products, I am going to wait a long while before I post a review.\\&quot;  Well, after that first week, I noticed the mirror was still working great.  It has been about five months now and it is still working great!  And for some reason, it does not accumulate annoying water spots like all the others did.  I never thought I would find a truly fog-free mirror, but with this one I have.  So, I decided it was time to post this review.  Here are a few things about the product I would like to mention:  When I first received it I thought the plastic seemed cheap and I suspected it would not hold up to wear and tear.  Well, so far is has held up perfectly.  I do handle it as carefully as I can, because I do not want to drop it. I take if off the bracket gently when I go to fill it up with warm water and I take my time putting it back on the bracket.  It seems to me that if one handles it with care, it will last a very long time.  Also, I did not use the supplied tape and adhesive.  The way my shower is constructed, I was able to permanently mount it to the shower wall with two screws.  I carefully drilled holes into the wall bracket to put the screws through.  Guess what?  The plastic did not crack from the drilling.    Here is my routine:  I get into the shower and get the water warm.  I take the mirror off the bracket, pour out the old cold water from the last shower, fill it up with the fresh warm water, put it back on the bracket, use the supplied squeegee to get any water off the mirror, and it stays fog-free during the entire shower.  Wonderful product!</li>
    <li> Toilet Tree&#x27;s Fogless Shower Mirror works exactly as promised.  The mirror truly stays fogless in your shower as long as you follow the instructions and use it properly.  If you like to shave in the shower this will be perfect for you.  Also, great for removing make up, and scrubbing your face in the shower girls.  The easy installation is another plus for this product.  I have often found that bath time objects usually do not adhere like they are suppose to.  We have had not one problem with our Toilet tree fogless shower mirror.  It works even bettter than promised.</li>
    <li> I purchased this fogless mirror for my husband back in Jan 2011.  The great reviews helped me make an easy decision to try it out.  When we recieved the mirror he wasnt able to use it right away because the adhesive in the box was rock hard.  I sent a request to ToiletTree Products for a new tube of adhesive and got a speedy response.  Within 3 days we recieved the glue and a complimentary shave kit.  The instillation was a breeze and it was usable within the next day.  My husband is a daily shaver and has told me multiple times how shaving in the shower saves him time in the morning.  Great product!</li>
    <li> this product is pretty well reviewed, so I wont go into a lot of detail. for the most part I am satisfied with this product, however there are a few things to note. first off if you have hard water you will get deposits on the surface of the mirror. also, because the mirror is acrylic it does warp considerably. you have to get pretty close up to be able to shave well, it was great for the first few weeks but it seems to be getting progressively more warped. for the calcium deposits from hard water I have been using vinegar and that seems to work ok, but for the warping its really just something you have to live with.</li>
    <li> I purchased one of these and absolutely loved it.  I then purchased another one in April.  The tilting mechanism was not working properly and I emailed them about it.  They responded in less than 30 minutes and are sending out a replacement and have an upgraded squeegy which they are sending me of for free.  I am in sales and was totally impressed by the customer service.  You have no risk when buying their products at all as they will stand behind them.</li>
    <li> I have purchased a few so called fog free mirrors in the past.  I love how this mirror attaches to the shower with silicone rather than a suction cup.  It is easy to remove the mirror from the base to fill with warm water, and it truly is fog free.  The mirror angle can even be adjusted!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product.  The set up was quick and easy and, most importantly, it really works!  Would recommend as a gift any day.</li>
    <li> This is the only fog-less mirror that actually works. Installation was easy and the mirror is clear and works flawlessly. Kudos to ToiletTree for an excellent design and execution. I will recommend this product to everyone looking for a fog free shower mirror!    CJ Garner</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I needed a mirror in the shower, but now that we have one, I love it. My kids can make sure they got all of the soap off of their face, do fun hairdos with the shampoo, and entertain themselves. My husband can shave and even I find myself using it often.    Plus, it really works. When you follow the directions, this mirror doesn&#x27;t fog up no matter what and we&#x27;ve put it to the test, so we should know! I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to friends and family.     It&#x27;s easy to use and install!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend who was beyond frustrated with his sharper image mirror that not only fell off the wall repeatedly until it broke (within about 3 days total), but also was so heavy I think it would have required nails to keep it on the wall. this mirror is PERFECT. we&#x27;ve had it for about 2 months and it stays put, works like a charm and we love it. A++</li>
    <li> This is an amazing concept a fogless mirror that actually doesn&#x27;t fog. I have purchased 3 other fogless mirrors in the past. All 3 needed special spray and eventually just fogged up anyway. I had low expectations for this but based on the previous reviews I figured I&#x27;d give it a try. Wow. I&#x27;m so glad I did. I can finally shave in the shower and actually see my face. The mounting system is also top notch. No more suction cups. This unit is well worth the money. I would have paid double!! Nice job ToiletTree!</li>
    <li> I have always liked to shave in the shower and have had many shower mirror types over the years. This one is very easy to install and use and perfect for what I need. Great product and very reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> It does exactly what it claims to do. It doesn&#x27;t fog, it doesn&#x27;t fall down, and the squeegee design and shelf are great extra touches. I&#x27;m very satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> This is truly the best fogless shower mirror I have ever owned and I have had 3 or 4 different mirrors over the past few years, none of them were fogless at least not by the time I was ready to use them.  I am confident this will be my last. This mirror is truly fogless, not just at the beginning of your shower but the entire time.  You simply fill the mirror up with the water coming from the shower and the mirror stays fog free, the entire mirror not just part of it.  The mirror comes with simple instructions for hanging and the silicone used to mount it to the shower wall.  The mirror mount tilts down so both myself and my wife are able to use the mirror, I am 6&#x27;5\\&quot; she is 5&#x27;6\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Thank goodness I found this mirror on Amazon!  I&#x27;ve bought other mirrors for the shower but they fog up the whole time and even as I wipe them with a towel, they keep fogging.  My husband absolutely loves it for shaving and my 15 year old son is bugging and begging me to get one for his shower, too.  It makes the whole \\&quot;getting ready in the morning\\&quot; process faster and easier!</li>
    <li> Best mirror ever! It is as stated.</li>
    <li> A+++. Highly reccomend !!! Got this as a gift for my boyfriend as a Christmas gift and he absolutely loves it. All u do is fill the back with warm water in the shower and it never fogs. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have purchased (or had purchased for me as gifts) no less than 10 different fog-free shower mirrors over the years, each claiming to be the \\&quot;only true fogless mirror\\&quot;.  They all failed within a few weeks or months at best.  Disappointing.  My daughter bought this mirror for Father&#x27;s Day last year (2011) and it works perfectly! in fact, it works SO well that I recently bought a second one for my lake house.  It simply works - simply.  Just fill the reservoir with water from the shower, squeegee off the water drops and shave.  Simple.  Dump the water out when you&#x27;re done - or do it the next day.  Doesn&#x27;t matter as far as I can tell...  Great product - easy to use - works as described.  &#x27;nuff said!</li>
    <li> Product works as advertised!  I like that it doesn&#x27;t require a link to the shower head.  Add some water to the space behind the mirror and NO FOG.  (By the way, you add hot/warm water each time you need to use the mirror) Cool!</li>
    <li> Just like it says,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It won&#x27;t fog up as long as you fill it with warm water.  It uses Tape and silicone adhesive so it won&#x27;t fall off the wall in the shower.  Squeegee works well and I actually use it to clean my bathroom mirror sometimes too.  Tilts so that people of different heights can use it more easily.</li>
    <li> The dimensions shown here are not correct. In particular, the depth of the gadget is 3+\\&quot;, not 1.5\\&quot;. I also think at least one other dimension is understated. The result is that the thing is too thick for my narrow tub shower stall - it just takes up too much space for comfort. It is ginormous as compared to the suction cup mirror I&#x27;ve been using. I don&#x27;t see any reason for it to be so large - I think it was just not something they paid attention to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are using in a more generous space, this would probably not be a concern, but it was dealbreaker for me. To the point that I never even installed it and so I have no comment on whether it remains fogless or not. I defer to others who say it does.</li>
    <li> I asked hubby why he shaved over the sink rather than in the shower, and that started an epic quest for the perfect shower mirror.  Quest ended here!  Others were returned for fogging up, falling off the wall, being too big or too small, or being just too complicated.  This mirror is perfect!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this shaving mirror. I&#x27;ve never been a shower saver but this mirror has me hooked. It works so well. Absolutely no condensation. My only gripe is the lack of a light, but I don&#x27;t think you could make a light live with all the water that this thing uses to balance the temperature of the air to the mirror. A worth addition would also be a clock as well, but once again, batteries and water &#x3D; corrosion. Very good product, don&#x27;t bother trying the crap at HD/Lowe&#x27;s or BB&amp;B. Buy the best, get rid of the rest!</li>
    <li> I have been shaving in the shower for years using mirrors advertised as fogless, but which fogged anyway.  I would just hold the mirror in one hand, running water over it while shaving with the other.  Once I found out about this thing, I did not believe it until I read the reviews.  It works, plain and simple.  I thought it was because of some new material, but it is really just common sense.  You remove the mirror from the stand and fill it with hot water at the beginning of your shower.  Genius.</li>
    <li> This is the second one we have purchased.  My husband says the shave in the shower is the best he has ever had.  This mirror makes that possible.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a few \\&quot;fog-less mirrors\\&quot; before this one and they pretty much all fogged up to the point where I&#x27;d have to clean it every few seconds to see myself. This thing is great, it&#x27;s worth the price tag. This will be my last shower mirror.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and it really works&lt;br /&gt;If you want to shave in the shower you must have one of these.  I shave my head and now I don&#x27;t have to worry about cleaning up the bathroom sink.</li>
    <li> Each time we move to a new apartment, we buy another ToiletTree Mirror.  We leave it behind at the old apartment so that we can share the awesomeness of this mirror with the new renters!  Both my boyfriend and I use and love this mirror.</li>
    <li> No more blur images in warm shower. tried many mirrors , this is the ony one that works in a bathroom with warm shower. the mirror stays perfectly clear to have the best shave &amp; a clear image. Toilet tree- thank you! for this great invention - you have won me to visit your marketplace  for more user friendly products.</li>
    <li> No unpleasant surprises. Only caution: you might try taping it up temporarily until you find the best permanent location to fasten it.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Exactly like they described and it really doesn&#x27;t fog up! If your looking for a fogless mirror stop here</li>
    <li> I strongly considered electric solutions to the foggy shower mirror issue, but was put off by the unreliability of the reviews I read. I went with this product and have been pleasantly surprised at how effective it is.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Fogless Shower Mirror from ToiletTree Products for a family member for Christmas last year, and it was a great gift.  I recently went home to visit, and was able to use it myself.  Since I usually wash my makeup off in the shower, it was great to be able to see what I was doing.  It&#x27;s a great mirror, really good looking, and useful.  The customer service by ToiletTree Products was great as well.  The deliversy was fast and efficient, and the company made sure I had the product in time for the Holidays.  I hope this company comes out with new products and soon.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> This product works exactly as it should. My only complaint is that it didn&#x27;t stick as well as it should have, but perhaps it was just too damp when I hung it. I think that some 3M strips would help that, but only if not placed directly under the shower head, as mine was...</li>
    <li> Fogless it is !!!!!! Nice product.</li>
    <li> The product frame attaches to the shower wall with a special silicone adhesive [needs to cure for two days before applying pressure to the mount.] Once it&#x27;s set, the mirror slides onto the frame. The mirror has a reservoir behind it that you fill with water from the shower. VOILA! No steam on the mirror. Afterwards, slide the mirror up, turn upside down to empty the water, and slide back on. That&#x27;s it. Only one problem I had: There were multiple vials of the adhesive provided to apply to specific areas of the product mount. One of my vials was old and congealed rendering it useless. Fortunately, I had similar heavy duty mounting adhesive on hand. Otherwise, I would have contacted the company to get me some more. The silicone adhesive is secure. I&#x27;ve had the mirror mounted for 5 months, taking daily showers and shaves. It is still just as secure as the day I started using it.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a decent anti-fog mirror for some time. After seeing all the positive reviews for this product on Amazon, I decided to buy one. This is a really well thought out product and I could not be happier with it. It&#x27;s all plastic construction, so for me that&#x27;s a plus because I don&#x27;t have to worry about cheap metal rusting in a few weeks like another product I&#x27;ve owned. The mirror itself is also plastic so even if you drop it, it won&#x27;t break like glass. The mirror will not fog at all once the reservoir is filled with warm shower water. It&#x27;s easy to mount and unmount when filling with water. The vertically adjustable mount is also a well thought out feature. Even the squeegee and squeegee holder at the base of the bracket is very well thought out. At first I didn&#x27;t think it was necessary, but if there is too much water on the mirror it&#x27;s a great tool to have. Installation was simple with the instructions provided. They made it obvious where to apply the silicone glue and double sided tape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing some people may not like is the fact that it has to be glued to the wall. Personally, I was looking for something with suction cups. Although, I don&#x27;t mind the fact that it has to be glued to the wall because I&#x27;m not going to move it around once it&#x27;s up anyway. When you really think about it, it can&#x27;t be done any other way. The best way for a product like this to consistently prevent fogging is to fill it with warm water. Unfortunately, the water adds a lot of weight that suction cups may not do a great job of holding up. In other words, you can&#x27;t make a better product than this in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 3/10/13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic has grooves that let&#x27;s you adjust the vertical angle of the mirror. The problem is, that mechanism has worn over time. As a result, it doesn&#x27;t stay in position when it&#x27;s filled with water. I still feel that it&#x27;s a good product. However, I took my review down two stars because of this issue. For the money,it should have lasted longer. Other than that, it still does what it&#x27;s meant to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 5/18/13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vertical adjustment issue mentioned above got worse, it now only stays in one position. It&#x27;s on the brink of completely losing its ability to stay up. This is a major problem because I will either have to find a way to try to keep it in one position permanently or replace the whole thing if it doesn&#x27;t work out.</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my boyfriend who claimed there is no such thing as a fogless mirror, well I found one that really is and he cannot believe it!  It stays on the wall, it&#x27;s easy to use and he absolutely loves it and the squeegee.  This is highly recommended for anyone who needs a shower mirror that works and looks good too!</li>
    <li> The fogless portion of this mirror works great.  You put hot water in the back and it never fogs up.  However, the water builds up on the mirror constantly.  It doesn&#x27;t bead up and drip down as expected.  Therefore, even though it does not fog up, it is very difficult to see your reflection.  I may try to put Rain-x on it and see if that helps.  Overall, it looks nice and it stays fog-free, but it leaves water droplets all over the mirror itself, which makes it very difficult to see clearly.</li>
    <li> I first installed this mirror about six months ago.  I was pleased with the mirror, but it broke.  I posted a review on Amazon.com about it breaking, and within a week, Toiletree sent me a replacement part (and a handwritten card) without me even contacting them.  Wow!  I am certainly impressed by the customer service and quality of Toiletree!  Thank you for standing behind your product!</li>
    <li> This product is as advertised and then some. It is so good I plan on giving it as Christmas and birthday presents. Why are all products not this well thought through and then made?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three cheers to the company!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John Andrew in Alabama.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just used this mirror one time so far. It installed easily. The size of the mirror is a good size I think. I didn&#x27;t need any of the other gadgets (clock, radio, lights, etc.)other manufacturers sell. I just wanted a decent mirror. And this one is. My shower is large (6x5) with lots of heads but steam does not seem to build up much in there. However, I did fill the anti-fogging water reservoir with warm water and didn&#x27;t experience any fogging. The squeegee seemed to work OK for me. I use the built-in shelf to hold my razor and it is handy. I think I will follow the recommendation of another reviewer and drill a small hole at the base of the reservoir to let the water drip out slowly. Over all I expect to enjoy this useful and simple shaving mirror or a long time. Simple, attractive, works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 11-26-2012: I&#x27;ve recently had to glue into a fixed position the mirror. The plastic ratchet mechanism that allows for positioning the mirror to various angles finally wore out and would not hold the position when the reservoir was full of hot water. I can still take it off the fixed holder to fill the reservoir. Over all and for the past 2 years the mirror has performed well for me.</li>
    <li> This is such an awesome product! It&#x27;s attached really firmly to the wall of my shower and the mirror is a perfect size. The detached mirror is fairly light. I just keep forgetting to empty the water from the mirror, but that&#x27;s okay if you shower often enough to empty it the next time. I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve never had this shower mirror before.</li>
    <li> who&#x27;s the least foggy of them all? Bought this for my husband so he could shave in the shower and must admit that we&#x27;re both impressed, it truly is fogless!  Installation was a breeze. It&#x27;s well designed and even has a groove in the base to hold the squeegee so you don&#x27;t have to worry about where you put it the last time you used it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a fogless shower mirror for a while now, and if you are too STOP LOOKING! I use this product every time I get in the shower and it truly does never fall off or fog up. I&#x27;m really pleased with this product.    -Gabe</li>
    <li> I have now used this shower mirror daily for over a month.  Over the past 30 years I have tried all sorts of mirrors to shave in the shower, the most logical place to shave.  This is the best!  It is a bit of a hassle to use, but less so than the others - after all, bright shiny surfaces and steam are not compatable.  The clarity is excellent and it is far easier to maintain than other \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; mirrors that eventually require daily application of some product (anti-fog juice, soap, whatever).  I&#x27;ve gotten into the routine of filling it after I enter the shower (it&#x27;s really cool to watch it de-fog itself in 15 seconds after its been fogged up and you add warm water to the resevoir) and when I&#x27;m done I empty it and it&#x27;s ready for the next time.  Eventually you learn how to put your finger behind it as you find the slot it fits into and it becomes a rather simple process to get it back into its holder.  Be sure to use a level when you install it as it&#x27;s not worth removing and reinstalling if it&#x27;s not truly level the first time.  Also, I&#x27;ve found that in order to make the squeegee work well I do have to press rather hard - but then the mirror is clean and shiny.  I am very impressed with this product and look forward to enjoyable shaving for years to come.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased and satisfied with the mirror and their customer service.  I had first had trouble getting the product to stick to the tile as I did not put enough adhesive on the back of the mirror.  This was explained to me and new adhesive and back sent to me .  I used all the adhesive and the mirror stuck.  Great customer service and product.</li>
    <li> I was very impressed the first shower I took and the mirror did not fog at all.  I highly reccomend the product</li>
    <li> This is the first mirror that actually works. I have tried far too many that didn&#x27;t. I would buy this product again in a heartbeat. Worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for over a year. Still a great product. Very happy I bought it and would buy it again in a heart beat. It continues to work perfect. Best shower mirror I ever had.</li>
    <li> I do not think that I have written a review for anything I have purchased on Amazon.  I haven&#x27;t simply because rarely does a product I order exceed my expectations.  They all just barely do what they say and that&#x27;s not review worthy for me.  This mirror on the other hand works fantastically well.  I have gone through a lot of shower mirrors only to be disappointed and frustrated with the quality regardless of the price.  They rust, distort and stop working after a short time.  I even purchased &amp;#34;Cat Crap&amp;#34; anti fogging ummm... crap for my last mirror to extend it&#x27;s usefulness.  It got me an additional week or so.  This mirror is simplistic in use ability to perform as described.  Put the hot water in and shave.  I was expecting it to do that at the very least which it did, but the mirror looks great too.  I have zero distortion in mine and I need that as I tend to trim my beard a lot of different ways.  The mirror stays clear even when I am right up next to it breathing on it.  Creepy to say it like that but my other mirrors would fog when I got to close and breathed on them.  It attaches to the wall very easily and isn&#x27;t going anywhere.  The squeegie works great at eliminating the drops that form on the mirror and cleans it up nicely as well.  I am stoked about this mirror and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great shaving mirror.  I kinda wish I had purchased the bigger one with the light because I just like that kind of stuff.  Oh well, happy as could be with this one.  Update: 6/1/15 I have moved since I originally bought the product and I contacted the company to see if they would send me more silicone for my new place.  They replied almost immediately and sent me a new tube right away.  That was a couple of years ago.  I just contacted them this morning to ask them about a replacement part that was wearing down because I use this thing so much and once again they got back to me within 5 minutes.  They are going to send out a replacementpart right away.  This is a great product from a great company.  Rarely have I put so much use into a product and had it last as long as it has with as much customer support as I have received.</li>
    <li> I received this mirror for a blog review and it is an awesome product! My husband and I both use it and can testify that is really is fogless! Definitely a must-have for the shower.[[ASIN:B003BQ6QXK Fogless Shower Mirror with Squeegee by ToiletTree Products. Guaranteed Not to Fog, Designed Not to Fall.]] Check out my blog post for more info: [...]</li>
    <li> I decided to try this out.  It is wonderful.  Well worth the money, easy to read instructions for mounting.  I liked this so much I bought a second one for me at work (I work offshore).  I can truthfully tell you that this is a great item, well designed, and should give you years of service.</li>
    <li> This mirror works awesome. My girlfriend got me this for Christmas and I love it. I does exactly what it should. I&#x27;ve never shaved in the shower before and it is so so so much better. No more bending over the sink with my soar back. no more shaving cream all over the sink , and water to clean up at the sink. no more towels covered in shaving cream. I wish i got this 20 years ago but i don&#x27;t think it was invented yet. Don&#x27;t hesitate, buy it and live like a KING, KING KEVIN! I love it and so will you. not recommended as a gift for the blind.</li>
    <li> This is the best anti-fog mirror we&#x27;ve ever purchased. Just wish it would have included an am/fm radio for that price. Oh well! At least it came with a nice shelf and a squeegee!</li>
    <li> About 30 days after I put it on my shower wall, the mirror fell down.  The silicone is still on the wall... the mirror housing itself came off the silicone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very careful with the installation, so I&#x27;m thinking that the product is not as good as I had hoped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the mirror itself seemed a bit &amp;#34;warped&amp;#34; (like a fun house mirror, although not as severe of course).  It was annoying at first, but I had to tell myself to get over it and ignore it.  Then when it fell down in the middle of the night and scared the @#$% out of me and my wife at 2am, that was the last straw when I decided that I did not feel like the product met my expectations (for $30 for a mirror, I feel like I should really love it, not just think it&#x27;s okay).</li>
    <li> Purchased this mirror on 8/6/11 and until a few months ago, it worked well for my needs.  Normally, users need to fill it up entirely with water in order to ensure that no fog appears on the surface.  Well, I can only fill it half full as now the mirror bracket tilts all the way down immediately if I add any more. Very frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, at the bottom of the mirror glass and to the right side, it appears that the mirror is cracked.  The surface is still smooth, but a portion of the mirror is no longer useful.  Not sure how that happened, as the mirror has never been dropped.  These blemishes appeared out of nowhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, the idea of this product is sound, but I was expecting the product to last longer than 6 months.  Not sure about the quality of their deluxe model, but before running into these issues on this version, I really had wished that they had added a led light, but better late than never, I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE 5/11/12***&lt;br /&gt;Received a replacement yesterday(!) so quickly after my original review.  Was able to use original backing so no need to pry off the old mirror backing first.  And now it&#x27;s working flawlessly.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s still plastic, of course, so the same issue may occur in the future, but with such outstanding service as I just received, that&#x27;s no longer an issue.  An easy 10 out of 5 for service...it is so exceedingly rare to come across a company that really puts it&#x27;s customers first in this day and age, so I&#x27;ll be sure to remember these guys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE 7/2/12***&lt;br /&gt;I want to love the product, but the mirror bracket failed again.  The mirror itself is in perfect shape, but the second I put any water into it, the mirror tilts all the way forward and it&#x27;s really hard to use.  Nothing on my end was done to make this happen.  It just started to gradually fail over the past few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure what to do at this point.  If only the bracket was metal or any hardier material, then this mirror would be perfect.  5 stars for the mirror, but 0 for the bracket, so we&#x27;re down to an average of 3 stars. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE 8/7/12***&lt;br /&gt;Well, the bracket is so bad that it tilts straight down immediately now.  This would make the product worthless, but thankfully my bottle of shampoo is just the right size to fit behind the mirror to make this a non-issue.  It&#x27;s an annoyance, yes, but this workaround is ok.  It still amazes me that the manufacturer hasn&#x27;t fixed this simple problem...a metal bracket would completely resolve this.rfect.  5 stars for the mirror, but 0 for the bracket, so we&#x27;re down to an average of 3 stars. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE 8/7/12***&lt;br /&gt;Well, the bracket is so bad that it tilts straight down immediately now.

    <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband since his other one kept falling from the shower and would always fog up and the radio was either too quiet or too loud. It works great, you just fill up the back with hot water and the mirror stays fogless throughout the rest of your shower. This is much better than our previous one. We don&#x27;t have it hung up the way it&#x27;s supposed to, since we&#x27;re moving in a couple of months.  This one doesn&#x27;t have a radio, but we just bought something else which seems to be adequate enough.  I would definitely recommend this to someone who would want a more definite way of keeping your mirror fogless as opposed to the ones that just advertise themselves as having a fogless glass, since those don&#x27;t seem to last for longer than a couple of showers.</li>
    <li> This shower mirror really surprised me. Of course it&#x27;s all plastic but made all high quality. It&#x27;s very easy to install. Most of the time I don&#x27;t have to fill out with the hot water in the back. The tilting works great so my wife and I can adjust it with no problems. A big PLUS compared to other shower mirrors I owned before!!</li>
    <li> Perfect for shower. Easy to install. Just follow directions. Works exactly as described. Looks very elegant in shower. This is the best product for a great price. Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I bought two for my son and husband, it is a piece of plastic junk, I´m even ashamed to give it as a gift, not worth it, and very difficult to install, the worst thing I have ever bought. Just useless! I live outside USA so it is difficult for me to return it so I just resign myself for my error.</li>
    <li> The ratchet with little plastic teeth on which the mirror swivels and adjusts up and down no longer holds the mirror up, the weight of the water over time is too much for the poorly contructed plastic hinge to bear. It worked great for 6 months, but now as soon as you fill it up with water it tilts down, so all you can shave now is your pubes. However, rather than replacing it, I inserted a styrofoam block of just the right thickness behind it to support it and prevent from tilting - works fine. I don&#x27;t see a need for angle adjustment anyway. I would have given it 1 star for poor design, but the concept is great, execution is poor, and I made it work, so I give it 2 stars</li>
    <li> This mirror is perfect.  Way better than what I&#x27;ve had in the past.  Stays mounted well - follow the directions, use all the silicone.  Easy to take on and off to fill with water.  I often forget to empty the water when I&#x27;m done, and even with the extra weight from the water I&#x27;ve had no issues so far with it coming down.  No fog.  The tray and squeege are a nice touch.  But this one and be done - you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to purchase this fogless shower mirror. As is likely the case with anybody else looking at such a product, I was hoping to both get a better morning shave and shave time off of my morning routine. Ultimately, the concept is fine; the mirror does not fog if used properly. Unfortunately, after two months, the mechanism on the back of the mirror that allows you to set the mirror for your particular height failed. The plastic teeth that are supposed to engage and lock at the desired height completely stripped and the mirror, when filled with even the least bit of water, immediately drops to the lowest setting, angling, literally, to the floor of the shower. I have tried to tease the mirror back to a proper height, in hopes that it could balance for 90 seconds while I shave--again, no luck. At this point, it has become a rather useless shower decoration, the mirror dangling dejectedly downward. So, again, I would say that this is a great concept hampered by poor/cheap design. Wish I could be more positive.</li>
    <li> A good product with a fine mirror.  Only problem was that the adhesive was old and hard - had to purchase separately.</li>
    <li> You have to mount this to the wall with silicon, but it holds steady and looks like a quality fixture in my shower.  I use this every day and it is a pleasure to see that it continues to work each time, unlike the previous fog-less mirrors I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Seriously, NO FOG! So awesome. And I can&#x27;t say enough how much I love not waking up in the middle of the night because a cruddy mirror with faulty suction cups is clambering to the shower floor. Being woken up by a shower mirror is something no one should have to endure, let alone about once a week.     I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s not going to come off of the wall very nicely when it&#x27;s time for me to move on to another apartment ... oh well, I&#x27;ll deal with that bridge when it comes. If you own your property then I&#x27;d say there is no downside to this mirror.</li>
    <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve tried everything from cheapo fog-free mirrors from discount stores to the one from Brookstone that supposedly is \\&quot;the best.\\&quot; In the end, nothing worked as promised.  I decided to give Amazon a whirl as I value greatly the spot-on customer reviews and wonderful product selection.  At first, I couldn&#x27;t believe the rave reviews.  The positives were astounding, while the negatives were (in my opinion) minor and nitpicky.  Could this be the one?  I thought I&#x27;d give it a try knowing full well that if it didn&#x27;t work out, Amazon would happily return my money.  I received the item much earlier than expected (typical), and noticed right out of the box, I was dealing with a different animal.  This is not your grandfather&#x27;s fogless mirror; from the packaging of the mirror, to the solid construction frame and mounting materials, I knew I made the right decision.  I followed the easy to follow mounting instructions, and had the mirror up within minutes, hassle-free.  The mirror comes with a squeegee, and I questioned whether or not I needed it, but attached it anyway inside the designed slot under the razor stand.  (It was apparent the manufacturer put a lot of thought into design as everything fit perfectly).  The next day, I gave it a whirl.  When it was time to shave, the mirror slid easily off the base, and the large opening at the top allowed the reservoir to fill quickly with warm water.  I returned the mirror back to the base and waited for the fog, but nothing.  Waited a little longer, nothing--it was working perfect. (I realized the value of the squeegee during shaving as water would occasionally splash on the mirror.  No problem, the squeegee took care of it!).  After shaving I slid the mirror off the mount, dumped the water and returned the mirror to the mount.  The mount  attached perfectly to the tile, and didn&#x27;t move at all.  All in all, the best (and only) fogless mirror you&#x27;ll ever need!  I&#x27;ve had it now for over 2 months and still working perfectly.</li>
    <li> Product is exactly as advertised, easy to use and no fog. First time in my life I&#x27;ve ever had a legitimate no-fog mirror, I honestly didn&#x27;t think such a thing existed until now. Quick shipping.</li>
    <li> Downside:  The plastic mirror is susceptible to scratching so I would suggest vinegar (to break down water spots) and your finger for cleaning.  Regular vinegar should keep it clean.  No squeegee and no towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upside: I had two reasons to contact the manufacturer and they were FANTASTIC.  They stood behind their product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mirror to replace a &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; mirror from Brookstone.  This mirror works exactly as advertised.  The only feature I wish it had was magnification.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried almost every shower mirror known to man and they all fog up except the one&#x27;s you attach to shower head and those drip water and can obviously only be mounted in bad locations.  This mirror can be mounted in any location in the shower, it&#x27;s easy to install and best of all, it works great!!  Brilliant design!  The reviews are excellent for a reason.  You will not be disappointed with this mirror.  The only recommendation I can make is that you want to test the location before you mount it as you have to glue it to the wall.  Not that difficult since you look into the mirror while you mark the height.</li>
    <li> THREE YEARS LATER: I am STILL ON MY FIRST ONE OF THESE MIRRORS AND IT HAS NEVER REQUIRED ANY MAINTENANCE!!I  So many of you guys have had to be shopping for a good fog less mirror for shaving. Trust me, this is the last one you will ever need to buy. I have tried so many and more expensive fogless mirrors and this is the only one that lasts more that a month or so. I have two of them, my first one is a year old and is still like new! Really! Don&#x27;t waste your time and money on any others, I already did that for you. I LOVE this mirror!</li>
    <li> I love this mirror. Its the only one that has never fallen from my shower wall. It does not fog up if you follow the simple instructions that come with it. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> I bought this shavin mirror for my husband as a Christmas gift. He has nothing but good things to say about it. He especially likes the clarity of the mirror.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror 9 months ago. A new roommate recently moved into our place and ripped the mirror off the wall with force because he thought it&#x27;s movable. The mirror was very sturdy and I never had any problems with it before. I emailed the Amazon seller about this and the CEO sent me an email response in 7 minutes. 3 hours later, he had mailed a replacement sticky backside for me to hold up the mirror and the squeegy. It arrived in the mail within 2 days.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews for products, but this one is worth the time.  This is the 3rd shower mirror I have owned.  I had all but given up on using a shower mirror when I moved into my new place and the shower had textured tile which won&#x27;t hold with the suction cups of my old mirror.  After a year of no mirror I had to figure out a way.  I was looking online for ideas of other ways to hang a mirror.  Even considering hanging it with fishing line(which the girlfriend rejected).  The ToiletTree mirror has such a simple answer to the hanging problem.  The biggest added benefit of this mirror is that it does NOT fog.  I had almost forgotten how annoying it is to have a fogging mirror.  In the past, I had even returned my Brookstone Shower Mirror after 5 months when it started fogging because I had some warranty.  It didn&#x27;t fog for another couple months and then it was over and started fogging again.  This mirror is amazing.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Highly recommend to all!!!!</li>
    <li> It actually WORKS!!  The process is truly idiot-proof:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Mount it and wait for the adhesive to dry overnight.&lt;br /&gt;2. Fill it with hot water and wait a minute.&lt;br /&gt;3. Shave in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t need to write a year-long chronicle like some of these other knuckleheads.  It WORKS.  Buy it and shave in the shower.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mirror as a birthday present for my husband and we both love it! It works just as described and best of all allows him to shave in the shower and saves me from having to clean up after him :) The company also has great customer service and sent me out an extra adhesive kit free of charge.  Over all I am very happy with this product and would recommend it over any other mirror for two reasons: Product works great and outstanding customer service.</li>
    <li> It is truly a fabulous item. It works exactly as you said it would. I LOVE IT</li>
    <li> This works exceedingly well.  This replaced a item from a popular mall gadget store which was ineffective since day one.  The mirror works flawlessly in the shower and the water reservoir doubles as a rinse for the shower floor when I am done.  I would like to see the mirror guides a bit larger and tapered to make it easier to slide the mirror into the guide but that is my only issue.</li>
    <li> Received the shower mirror right on time and just in time.  Easy to install and very functional.  Highly recommend this company and this product.</li>
    <li> This is the best fogless shaving mirror I have ever used and I have tried several of them. This is the third  one I have bought, two for myself and one for a gift. I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving in the shower for a long time, and I have always struggled to find a good mirror that does not fog up and stays in place.  This mirror is a great option for the price.  Easy to install, and it has been rock solid since I hung it in my shower.  Much better than any suction cup options that are usually available.  It absolutely does not fog up.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item in October 2010 and have been using it for a year with no issues whatsoever. It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to, keeping the mirror fogless and having a handy spot for the razor as well. I recently moved to a new location and wanted to bring the product along but the bracket arm was unfortunately damaged in the process. I e-mailed Toilettree&#x27;s customer service about getting a potential replacement and heard back from Kelly within 5 minutes or so. They were extremely friendly and gladly replaced both the bracket arm and the mounting materials free of charge. I was extremely impressed with their attentiveness to their customers and wanted to leave this review (which I almost never do) just to emphasize how pleased I am with their service. If anyone is swaying on the purchase (seems unlikely from the average 5 star rating over like 500 reviews) I just wanted to throw in another testimonial as to why the purchase is a no-brainer.  Thanks!  -Dan</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant to purchase this mirror since I had always been a post-shower shaver, however I have enjoyed the experience of shaving in the shower.  I am not sure how much time I am saving, a few minutes max. but I feel like I get a little closer shave.  I do like being closer to the mirror than usual as well.  Installation was a breeze.  Make sure you install it 24 hours before your next shave.  The mirror itself is a little small but it works fine.  Once filled with water the mirror works as promised (no fog).</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this mirror.  It does not fog up and is so easy to install.  This was such a great buy for both me and my husband!!!</li>
    <li> I have tried several and this is the first one that has not fogged up and gotten all spotty within a few weeks. I have had for 3 months now and it is still perfect. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> While installation is a little bit cumbersome, the mirror system is one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Similar to several other reviews on this product, I have tried several versions of \\&quot;fog free\\&quot; mirrors from other manufacturers. I have no idea how they can call themselves \\&quot;fog free.\\&quot; It makes me wonder if they ever actually tested it out.    This product truly is fog free. Thank you for making a product that actually does what it is supposed to do.     I also really like the silicone adhesive used to install it. I have been awakened far too many times from other brands of mirrors that are installed with suction cups that decide to let loose in the middle of the night and crash to the floor.    My only complaint about this product is that I have found that the squeegee does not seem to work very well. I live in Arizona and we have \\&quot;hard\\&quot; water, which makes it difficult to keep anything in the shower clean. If any water is left on the surface, it will leave hard water spots when it dries. In order to work around this issue, I take the mirror off of the bracket and dry it with a microfiber cloth and store it outside of the shower on days when I do not use it for shaving.     Overall, this is definitely the best product of its type that I have run across and I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Have had this mirror now for 3 months.  Secure attachment, easily adjusted.  Easily filled with warm water which indeed prevents fogging.  Be careful of mirrors that claim fogless performance (I have had 2 others).  Most have a film that prevents fogging but this design is flawed as the fogless effect is only temporary.  This mirror is a little more pricey but as the saying goes - you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I have had several shower mirrors with suction cups and they all fall down after a little while. Also, those cheaper mirrors have a finish on them that goes bad very quickly. This Toilettree mirror is terrific. It will never fall off the shower wall, is made of a durable heavy grade plastic, and the mirror is definitely fogless using their system. I am thrilled with it and when I called their customer service with a question, they were immediately helpful and courteous. Would not hesitate to buy their products and especially this mirror.</li>
    <li> This mirror is different.  It actually remains fog-free.  The trick is that the mirror has a reservoir behind it.  Jump in the shower, fill it with hot water.  No Fog!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror attached PERMANANETLY, via an epoxy.  It holds great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a little squeegee just in case you need to wipe off some splashes.  There is also a little shelf for your razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/5 stars for a reason!</li>
    <li> Good product that really works.  I can now shave in the shower.  Didn&#x27;t need to fill with water to avoid steaming up....maybe because a our shower is big.</li>
    <li> Finally, a fogless mirror that really works! The 1st thing that impressed me was how easy this mirror was to install, and how clear the instructions were. Once installed, this mirror has changed my morning routine, and trimming my beard has never been easier. No more leaning over the sink to get close enough to the mirror to see clearly. The image is clear and with the tilt feature can be adjusted for the different heights of everyone in the household. The squeegee with built in storage is a great idea and really comes in handy. I use this mirror every day, and have just purchased more as gifts. The perfect gift for friends and family! I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product that works well and provides me with great satisfaction!  One improvement might be to drill holes in the razor shelf to allow multiple razors a place to hang much like a toothbrush holder.</li>
    <li> Eureka, I finally found one (after trying out at least four other &#x27;fogless&#x27; mirrors.  This product works as advertised.  Truly fogless and it&#x27;s not a hassle!  I only wish the mounting frame weren&#x27;t shiny black - but that&#x27;s not a knock on the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had several \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; shower mirror in the past, but none of them has been anywhere near as good as this one.  This mirror is truly \\&quot;intelligently designed\\&quot; in every respect.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m usually that guy that just looks at reviews before I buy something but this product is so good I felt compelled to let you all know. Before buying this product I went through 3 other \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; mirrors that all fell quite consistently and were constantly fogged.  This mirror is easily attached solidly to the wall and only takes a matter of seconds to fill it with water to absolutely guarantee a crystal clear image...totally, 100% fog free!!  The only slight imperfection is the squeegee that comes with the mirror.  It does not work wonderful but it&#x27;s good enough and is not something that would change my opinion in any way about this product.</li>
    <li> I glues this to my ceramic tile with the silicone include and it held amazing, but I glued it crooked. So I removed it and scraped of the silicone and re-glued it with clear silicone from my caulking gun. Held just the same. Mirror adjust up and down. You can easily remove the mirror and fill it with water really easy from the shower head. The squeegee that is included is great for cleaning the mirror when droplets gather. The only issue is the mirror distorts and warp you reflection at around 3 feet distance. You have to fairly close to it. So if your going to use it from some long distance shaving or admiration of yourself while you shower. Don&#x27;t get this mirror. Other then that this mirror ROCKS!</li>
    <li> Pretty much says it all -- the adhesive is not very good and would not stick well to my tile.  Fell a few times in the first week but mirror was working okay.  Around week 3, it fell in such a way that the mirror glass broke.</li>
    <li> This product works exactly as described!!   Installation is simple, the provided directions are very clear, and the necessary glue is provided. Just glue the plastic bracket to your shower tile (the back of the bracket has grooves labeled for where the glue goes, so you can&#x27;t make a mistake), wait 24 hours, and you are good to go.   Taking the mirror off, filling it with warm water, and slipping it back on are very easy. There is no need to worry about the mirror falling off, and no need to worry about fog.   Also, the mirror can be easily adjusted and more than enough room on the built in shelf for 2 razors.  For a truly fog free shaving experience this product works great!! I really love this product and recommend it.</li>
    <li> Sometimes I wonder about the fate of humanity...I&#x27;ve just about given up on Flying Cars as a part of my future so things like this really do it for me. A fog-free mirror  THAT WORKS. Not just for a week but quite possibly until robots are clogging up the streets panhandling for lithium batteries. And it&#x27;s a simple premise- use hot water to negate fog. Einstein would have shaved his &#x27;stache over this. I couldn&#x27;t be happier staring at myself in the shower. Thanks ToiletTree- btw great name!</li>
    <li> This is the best shaving mirror I have ever used.  I followed the instructions and installation was a breeze.  Prior to each shower, I turn the water to hot, wait until it is steamy then fill the reservoir.  The mirror does not fog during the entire shower.  I find no distortion and when it gets water on it, one wipe of the squeegee and I am all set.  At the end of the shower, I remove it from the mount and pour out the water.  It could not be any easier.  I especially like the tray at the bottom of the mirror.  A perfect place for my razor.</li>
    <li> We have used numerous shower mirrors over the years. None of them performed as well as the ToiletTree mirror.  Not only is the glass high quality, it truly is &#x27;fog-less&#x27; due to hot water one must fill up the back side of the mirror with during each use. I initially thought this process would be a hassle, but I just hold it under the shower head for a few seconds. Absolutely brilliant!</li>
    <li> As others have noted, there&#x27;s a reason why this product is so highly rated. It works exactly as described. Ah, the wonders of simple physics. It&#x27;s a simple design and easy to install. Small quibbles: the instructions say to wait 12 hours, though as others have noted, you apparently need to wait 24 hours. In my case I waited 16 hours (since the instructions said 12). I hope it doesn&#x27;t fall off anytime soon. Also, it&#x27;s possible to not have the mirror fully in the wall mount&#x27;s slot when trying to slide it on, so you need to watch this.</li>
    <li> In fact it does not fog up. I switch the water from the showerhead to the tub faucet to fill it, squeegee the mirror, it&#x27;s ready to go.  Update (3/14/2017): Just replacing this today after our house cleaner&#x27;s abuse. I hang my Parker Safety Razor Handmade Deluxe &amp;#34;Long Loft&amp;#34; 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush from the shelf on one side, my razor in a hole drilled in the other, and a Schöne Stainless Steel Shaving Bowl with Lid in the middle (that rests in a ~4&amp;#34; stainless steel hose clamp looped around the neck of the mirror).</li>
    <li> Works great! Do follow instructions on installing to make it stick.  I have a glass shower (3 walls), and my 4th wall is made of travertine.  I didn&#x27;t want to put the glue on the glass, although I&#x27;m sure it would work just fine.  But it works excellent on the travertine... even with the little dimples in the material.    It works perfectly, as described.  The only thing it needs (which I hope it makes it in the 2nd version of this product), is a light that can surround the mirror.  My bathroom lighting is dim at nights, and it makes it hard to see shaving sometimes.  The mirror is slightly magnified, or I hope it is and that&#x27;s not really how big my face is (ha), so that definitely helps.    Perhaps the light can be selectable for different brightnesses.  My previous shower light was one big super bright LED that shined right in the eyes (from Sharper Image).  That was horrible.    Read other reviews for other details.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Pictures are very accurate.  The mirror looks nice, not cheap.  Stays in place and mirror stays practically fog free when you put water in the back.</li>
    <li> This fogless mirror does exactly what it advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not fog up....and it is a mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice little squeegy....but I lost it.  Otherwise it is a great fogless mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OH yeah....it stays on the wall pretty nicely.  And did I mention it does not fog up.</li>
    <li> This product is really amazing!  Prior reviewer recommended leaving water in reserve and adding warm water to the old with a cup and that works really well and makes defogging the mirror much simpler.  Gave this to my BF for xmas and he was so pleased.  I paired it with the Sangean radio which another reviewer recommended and that is amazing also.  I&#x27;ve trid other radios and the reception has been lousy.  The two together made a great gift.</li>
    <li> I have bought numerous &amp;#34;fog less&amp;#34; mirrors to have them fog up a month after purchase.  This product has far exceeded my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to anyone that needs a fog less mirror in the shower.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for myself quite a while ago and it has been awesome so I bought this one for my son for Christmas.  He loves how good it looks and how well it performs.  There&#x27;s nothing else like it, so simple but effective.</li>
    <li> Bought 3 of these, one for my husband and 2 for my sons. They have all really liked them and said they work well.</li>
    <li> This has been a fantastic fogless mirror, I love it! It works exactly as advertised, easy to set on wall and easy to use. Absolutely no fogging at this point which is great and a change from other &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; mirror&#x27;s I&#x27;d used in the past! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This mirror works just as it&#x27;s advertised.  Installation took 2 minutes.  Keep in mind that you will have to put a bead of silicon caulk (included) on the back of the mirror mount to secure it to the wall which could leave residue if you ever decide to take it down.  The mirror stays fogless as long as you take the mirror out of the wall mount (easily slides up and out), and fill the back with warm water from the shower head.  Comes with a squeegee which tucks into the wall mount as well.  You might want to splurge on the LED lit one if you&#x27;re shower area isn&#x27;t well lit.  Great purchase!</li>
    <li> The mirror works great for a month or so but once you affix it to the wall you have to remove the mirror everytime you shower and put in warm water and remove the cold water. Becuase of the weight of the water, the gear that changes the angle of the mirror warps and this it doesn&#x27;t stay straight anymore after a month or so of normal use.  Toiletree, however, fixed this by providing me with a new part and shipping it almost next day after I left a negative review. It would have been easier to just provide contact information in the listing since it seems like this is a common issue.  But at least I have my mirror working again!</li>
    <li> The Fogless bit is a little overselling the product. In order to make it fogless, you need to fill the thing with water, then drain it at the end, adding complexity to my morning routine that I don&#x27;t overly welcome. It is made of a cheapish plastic material, which I expected with the price, but still worth mentioning because the reflection is a bit hazy due to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it is a good product for the price and I use it regularly.</li>
    <li> This mirror is great! My husband was very skeptical when I first showed him what I ordered, before it came. He just built us a large all-slate shower, and he is very picky about what goes in it, but he wanted a shower mirror for shaving. After one day, he loved it! The installation instructions are very well written, with illustrations. I do not give compliments on instructions lightly as I am a technical writer, and that&#x27;s what I do for a living. The mirror attached easily to our slate shower wall. (And it is movable if needed, not permanent as some have said--you peel off the silicone and put new silicone in the new location.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the fog-free feature for the first time today--filling the reservoir with warm water. I simply lifted the mirror from the base, filled the reservoir with shower water, and replaced the mirror on the base. The mirror stayed fog-free for the entire shower (and I like it HOT)! My husband does not use this feature. He simply leaves the curtain over the mirror until he&#x27;s ready to use it and then shaves. The mirror stays fog-free if it&#x27;s behind the curtain and for long enough afterward to shave. (I realize that most people won&#x27;t install their mirror where they can pull a curtain over it. That is just how our shower is built--one wall is a half-wall (open door) with a fabric curtain to prevent water on the floor.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The squeegee also works very well, but I found out that it works better when then reservoir is filled with warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only wish is that it came with color options--bronze or black. Nothing else in our bathroom is silver.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve used them ALL and this one works the best! I just wish the mirror was a little bit better! Otherwise it&#x27;s well worth the price.  Good stuff.</li>
    <li> I honestly dont know how this products get high rating, please read this before you buy  Product fogs, apparently you need to take the miror out before shower and fill it with water of same temp. to work every time. But even with this it can fog.  My previous experience with fog free mirror (still hanging in one corner) was it also fogs but I just throw a splash of water and can see much clearly than this product. This product leaves water splash dots so hard to see, my previous product just defogs when I throw water.   So buying this prodcut is I consider as a step back now, instead of splashing water now I have to take it out and fill with water and overall less effective because of water spots. It does not seem to have a anti fog glass, but relies on the fact the temp of water matches the steam so wont fog.  I already put silicon gell and installed or would have returned, but please if you buy try it before installing.  Maybe I should have read all the reviewes carefully instead of just looking at the star rating</li>
    <li> I bought this item following all those positive reviews but very disappointed. It&#x27;s a pretty cheap plastic mirror, definitely not worth $30. It has deformed after a couple of days and now shows a very distorted image. Fell down several times, had to use duck tape to hold it on the wall.</li>
    <li> The silicone only lasted a year that holds it to the shower. But we&#x27;re just applied new clear silicone and it works again. Mirror hasn&#x27;t fogged up yet!! My husband loves it.</li>
    <li> This fogless shower mirror is the only one worth buying, and the price is excellent! I gave one to my husband for Christmas, and when my son saw it he went right on Amazon and ordered one for himself, (on Christmas Day). He had already spent more money on a different \\&quot;fogless shower mirror\\&quot; and said it did not work. They are both very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> My husband installed the mirror in our shower quite easily, and it feels pretty sturdy. It also has a small shelf that&#x27;s perfect to set his razor on, and a squeegee, for convenience. It&#x27;s amazing how a small mirror in the shower can be such a help. It uses an easy-fill water reservoir located in the back of the lightweight mirror to create a fogless in-shower experience. The Fogless Shower Mirror is shatter proof and rust proof for safety and longevity. My favorite part is although my husband installed it so that he can look right into it easily, I can still see it easily as well though he&#x27;s taller than me. It swivels up and down so that people of different heights have a clear view.    **I received a mirror to review.**</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this product, especially after many failed attempts with other so-called-fogless mirrors.  I&#x27;m not experiencing any of the distortion as discussed in other reviews - it&#x27;s not like a baggie as one reviewer mentioned.  This is a very adequate replacement for the mirrors that eventually fog.  I&#x27;ve had mine since August 2011 with everyday use and no fogging.  I emphatically recommend.  My squeegee is starting to work less effectively and is leaving small beads behind now, so that may be due for a replacement.  But much better than spending $20-$30 on a new \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; mirror every 4 months.</li>
    <li> The hinge on which the mirror swivels and adjusts up and down no longer holds the mirror up, Hot water must be placed inside the mirror and the weight of the water over time is too much for the poorly contructed plastic hinge to bear. It worked great for 6 months now it is a piece of junk.</li>
    <li> While its only been a few weeks since the product was left at my doorstep; I can say that the assembly was easy. Furthermore the product does as it was advertised, which is to stay fogless in my shower, with the addition of hot water to the backside. I am very satisfied and hope to return to ToiletTree for any other related shower or bathroom needs. I can recommend this supplier as a supplier of repute.</li>
    <li> This really doesn&#x27;t get fog on the mirror when you fill the back with water.  Works perfect for shaving in the shower.  It is kind of permanent with the silicone but can be taken off without breaking it.  I reattached in a different spot with just 3M tape and it holds great.  I also cut off the bottom shelf since I never put anything on it anyways.</li>
    <li> I recently received this mirror for my husband.  He shaves in the shower and always comes out with his face all cut up because his other mirrors fogged up.  This mirror is a God send!  It works when all the others haven&#x27;t.  It never fogs up as long as you follow the directions that come with the product.  It is very simple to install as well.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone needing a \\&quot;true\\&quot; fogless shower mirror.  [...]</li>
    <li> Well I have had mirrors in my shower before but none like this one.  I guess I didn&#x27;t read the full description, but you have to poor hot water in the top of the mirror to prevent the fogging and then emptied when you get out of the shower so the mirror doesn&#x27;t get ruined.  This thing isn&#x27;t moving, falling or goin anywhere, I love silicone!  I love the mirror &amp; it&#x27;s not even for me</li>
    <li> I bought the Fogless Shower Mirrors for two of my sons for Christmas.  One son uses it to shave his face, and the other uses it to shave his face and head.  They love the mirror.  Thanks for a great product.</li>
    <li> I have had this mirror for several months now and I can truly say that it works as promised! It stays completely fogless throughout the steamiest of showers and stays in place perfectly! We love the Fogless Shower Mirror by ToiletTree Products!</li>
    <li> Has fallen off shower wall 2X.</li>
    <li> The installation was easy and this product works great.  Just put warm shower water into the back and, voila, no fog in sight.  It also comes with a handy squeegee to get off water droplets, and it bevels for different height people.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I know some people have given this product 5 stars, but I do not know why.  This mirror is not \\&quot;fog less\\&quot; and certainly does not do what it claims.  I would never recommend anyone to buy this product.  We let the glue sit for twice as long as it suggested and within one day the mirror was falling off.  The first time we used the mirror it completely fogged up within 5 seconds of the water running in the shower.  The regular mirror we previously had in the shower fogged up less than this thing - IT IS TERRIBLE!  We are shipping this back to Amazon ASAP and getting our money back.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier.  There are more than enough good reviews to take a chance on this shower mirror.  The mirror image is perfect and stays fogless as advertised.  Those reviews with the problem of the mirror falling of the wall are the installers faullt I&#x27;m sure.  I&#x27;m guessing that they didn&#x27;t follow one step of the installation explicitly and that is to wipe the wall with isopropyl alcohol.  Don&#x27;t skimp on that with &amp;#34;this cleaner should be good enough&amp;#34;.  Get the alcohol.  It&#x27;s cheap and a critical component.  Get this mirror you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  Money well spent.  The best shaves are done in the shower.</li>
    <li> Works perfect in the shower, period.  I gave it a 4* because I have to do 2 extra steps each shower: (1) Fill the reservoir with hot water, no big deal; (2) empty it out when done with shower.  Gotta do those 2 steps each time, but only takes a few seconds.  Worth it for the 100% fogless result.  Would have given it a 5* without those extra steps.</li>
    <li> The mirror works perfectly. However, most of the silicone adhesive that came with it had already congealed in the tube when it arrived. The small amount that I could squeeze out (using a pair of pliers!) wasn&#x27;t enough to do the job. After a few weeks, the mirror came crashing down in the shower. Fortunately, it didn&#x27;t break. I bought a tube of real silicone adhesive at a hardware store and remounted the mirror. So 5 stars for the design of the mirror and one star for quality control to ship it with a tube of silicone that had gone bad.</li>
    <li> The product works as stated and much along the lines of other positive reviews. I have been using the product for about 3 months now and this is the first shower mirror that has been truly fogless. Filling the container with hot water is no hassle and it works great every time.</li>
    <li> This mirror works great!  It&#x27;s easy to install and definitely fogless.  The included squeegee is great for clearing the mirror after you&#x27;ve filled it with water.  Hard to beat it!  And the ToiletTree customer service is excellent!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my boyfriend and so far, he and I both are very pleased with it.  I was surprised to actually see it was in deed fogless, like it says!  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My take on this product in the order in which I dealt with it;  -The mirror was easy to mount.  Having a tray gave me a good place to set a little torpedo level when I stuck the bracket on the wall.  Between the supplied double sided tape and the silicone, I have no doubt that it will stay in place until I remove it.  -Filling the mirror is easy each time I use it.  Earlier reviewers talked about doing things like using a cup to fill the mirror (there is a chamber behind the mirrored surface).  I have a shower head on a long extension and figured that would be the easiest way to fill the chamber but after a couple of times, I just started removing the mirror and holding it up to the shower head.  It is faster, and in my opinion easier.  Both work but the bracket that holds the mirror has a U shape to it that makes the mirror VERY easy to lift up and put back.  -As it says, it is fogless.  The water keeps the mirror from fogging up and if you only fill the chamber halfway, you&#x27;ll see that you can get half a foggy mirror!  Great simple concept.  For years I used shampoo or shaving creme to keep my mirrors from fogging.  This is so much easier and better.  -The included squeegee is a nice bonus for helping to keep the mirror clean.    I don&#x27;t believe you will be disappointed in this product!</li>
    <li> I have had other shower mirrors in the past and they have not lived up to their promises.  I have had all the bells and whistles like lights on the mirror, a clock, adjustable magnification and not only were those features not helpful, the mirror itself was poorly designed.  The promise of no fog was not met... that is until this product entered my home!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fog-free design works, the warm water in the vessel does the job perfectly.  The mirror comes with a squeegee which keeps your mirror from spotting up (you need to use it, otherwise you will be tempted to use chemicals to clean off the spots which is something the instructions state NOT to do).  The mirror is not too heavy for it&#x27;s mounting and installing it was super easy.  You will need to wait a day before you use the mirror if you want to follow the instructions precautionary measures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is they didn&#x27;t add a bunch of features to complicate the mirror, but added what makes sense while designing a system that  meets why you bought the thing - FOG FREE SHAVING IN FRONT OF A MIRROR!  Wonderful!</li>
    <li> I have purchased three \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; mirrors for my husband, some of which were more expensive ($50) and all of which were only partially fogless for about a month, if not less.  This mirror is ingenious!  Works perfectly, and because of the design, there&#x27;s no way it will ever fog.  Hubby is extremely happy and said he doesn&#x27;t know how he ever shaved in the shower with the other ones - this one is so crystal clear! Great product, great value!  Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> After going through probably 5 shower mirrors over the past 3 year, this product is by far the best.  Would recommend to any potential buyer.</li>
    <li> So I bought this back in December and loved using it in my shower, until this week it fell from the tile and came crashing down.  Wrote to the supplier to see if I could get some more glue. I am waiting to hear back. Will let you know how the customer service is when I find out.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it says it will do - never fog up in the shower when used properly. I recently switched from a dry electric shaver to a wet-dry shaver, and this mirror does not fail in the least. I&#x27;ve tried several other mirrors in the past, and this is the only one that stands up to steam in a hot shower without fogging up. I&#x27;d have no reservations in recommending this to someone who needs a product like this.</li>
    <li> This is just wanted I wanted for shaving in the shower.  Simple, easy to install, no problems.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror for my son&#x27;s shower.  He said it works great.       I must admit, some great advice was given by a previous poster about drilling a hole at the bottom of the mirror so the water empties slowly.  I had my husband do this prior to attaching it to the shower wall.     That&#x27;s why this product gets only 4 stars from me and 5 stars from my son.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Love it.  Love it.  I only wish it was portable so I could take it with me.  But that&#x27;s what makes coming home so good.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Very handy and sturdy</li>
    <li> All the men in my family love this.</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY shower mirror that actually sticks in the shower. I have had no problems and love it!</li>
    <li> This product works perfectly! My husband had been shaving in the shower without a mirror so I bought this for him and found that it was very easy for me to install so that it could be a surprise for him when he got in the shower the next morning! I usually take a shower first and like it fogged so I don&#x27;t have to watch myself shower and he pours the water in when he&#x27;s shaving but leaves it empty on the other days. I was concerned about mildew or mold growing in the standing water but it hasn&#x27;t been an issue after 2 months so I&#x27;m really not worried it anymore. Very glad that I purchased this!</li>
    <li> The wife and I love this mirror, after years of constantly replacing the suction cup kind we were excited to try this out.  Just like they claim it does not fog and will not fall of your shower wall.  The mirror is big and of nice quality and tilts up and down for different height users.  Yes it takes a few seconds to fill, empty and squeegee but it has been worth it.</li>
    <li> This is the first fogless mirror I have ever owned.  I am very impressed with it.  Works as advertized.</li>
    <li> This mirror is the one to get.  Easily the best one on the market today.  However, my only complaint is that the face I see in the mirror I received is clearly not the one shown in the ad.  The one I see is frightful!  It looks like some half-asleep fat guy!</li>
    <li> It may be fogless, but the mirror is so distorted that it&#x27;s like looking at oneself in one of those trick mirrors at the carnival. Very disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> There is nothing more enjoyable that shaving in the shower. I&#x27;ve purchased fogless mirrors in the past - tried them all. They just didn&#x27;t work. Or they would work for 30 seconds and it was a race against the clock to shave before the mirror would star fogging up - Ultimately, they would fog up within minutes. When I built my home, I actually considered putting in this elaborate system in the shower so that I would have a fogless mirror, but it involved much electrical work and and would have cost over a thousand dollars. My wife talked me out of it and I shaved for the last 4 years at my sink. I hated it. For father&#x27;s day my wife bought me this mirror from Amazon and I thought, great another piece of crap. But she insisted this one was different... Some people think that $30 is expensive, and for what it is, a hunk of plastic, it may be. But if it actually does want you want it do it, then it becomes all relative. I personally would have spent 3x that much. The bottom line is, it works, it take 10 seconds to fill the reservoir in the shower, the mounting is super easy and is very solid, even on tiles which aren&#x27;t smooth (which is what I have). If fogless mirrors have frustrated you in the past, this one will not. The funny thing is, it&#x27;s a simple concept, and I can&#x27;t believe no one had thought of it before ToiletTree..... They deserve that $30 just for outsmarting everyone else.</li>
    <li> This is a great shower mirror.  My husband uses it to shave in the shower and loves it.  Installation was easy.  Here is the only problem:  The tube of silicone.  It arrived looking like a full tube, but when the cap was unscrewed, it totally deflated and there was absolutely nothing in it.  It didn&#x27;t even smell like it ever contained anything.  I had to run to the hardware store and get a tube of silicone for 2.97, which was not too much of a problem.  Other than that, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> This is a great Shower Mirror, it works exactly as promised! I have tried a few others from various places, but none do the job. This one does. If you are wondering whether or not it really works, it does!</li>
    <li> I really like this mirror for use in the shower. I am a male and use it to shave every day.  It is easy to install and works the way it is supposed to work.  The issue I have with it is that the \\&quot;gears\\&quot; for the rotating part of the mirror are plastic and are not able to hold the weight of the water when I add the warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror has a nice feature to be able to tilt it up and down.  I installed the mirror a little lower so my wife could use it and I could just tilt it up for when I use it to shave.  However, the plastic gears used for tilting seem to have worn over time.  Now when I add even just a tiny bit of warm water to defog the mirror, the mirror tilts all the way to the low tilt angle.  I have to hold the mirror&#x27;s angle to my height to use it.  This is frustrating and the design should account for this, since you need water (and its weight) to use it for its intended purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have given this mirror a 5 if not for this tilt issue.  I would buy this mirror for gifts if this tilt feature were not an issue.  You should consider buying this mirror, but make sure to account for the tilt issue when deciding what height to install it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12/21/13 update: Steve from ToiletTree Products saw my review and contacted me to offer to fix the issue of the mirror losing it&#x27;s ability to maintain a tilt.  He sent a replacement part that was easy to pop into place.  The \\&quot;gears\\&quot; now catch as they should and the tilt feature now works great.  I am very happy with the mirror and now revise my rating from a 3 to 5.  The company did a great job in fixing a design issue and reaching out to customers to ensure they are satisfied.  We should support companies like this.</li>
    <li> One year I had bought my husband a \\&quot;fogless mirror\\&quot;, which of course did not stay fogless for long (a week). Every day was a fight for him to try and shave in the shower. Since Christmas was around the corner, I did the research and found this one which was at a very decent price. It works great. Has already been a couple of months and it&#x27;s still fogless. It&#x27;s a great mirror!!!</li>
    <li> This shaving mirror is great. As long as you fill it up with Hot Water it does not fog up. This is a great product, I recommend it if you are looking for this type of product.</li>
    <li> A fogless shower mirror, until now an unrealistic dream. I&#x27;m not going to write a review that states it&#x27;s specs. I&#x27;m going to tell you straight out, this mirror does what it says. It&#x27;s amazing. I guess I use that a lot, but my step dad had a shower mirror and let me tell you, that thing was only good for the radio.  Who likes to try using a mirror in the shower that they have to splash with water every two and a half seconds. I know you all know what I&#x27;m talking about. I read reviews about this mirror and I had to laugh. Some people complained that it fogged. There is a reservoir at the back of the mirror to fill with water. If you&#x27;re taking a hot shower and fill it with cold water, it&#x27;s going to fog. If you are lazy like me and left the water in from the day before and thinks it might still work, it will fog. But it&#x27;s extremely easy to just dump out and grab hot water from your current shower. This is how it works its \\&quot;anti-fog magic\\&quot;.  The mirror is easy to apply to your shower wall, and sturdy, no worries. It comes with enough silicone adhesive to reapply many many times and comes off without a hassle, just a good pry.  I love the way it looks, it&#x27;s black and silver, sleak. There is a tray at the bottom to hold the reason it&#x27;s in there; shaver, tweezers etc. The mirror is adjustable, so even though it was installed for the man of the house, it can be adjusted for the much shorter woman in the house by simply tilting it down. It also comes with it&#x27;s own squeegee. If your ridiculous you might think that it&#x27;s broken. Life isn&#x27;t perfect and it&#x27;s going to take at least two or three swipes to clear the mirror, but when you get it done that&#x27;s it. It&#x27;s bright, beautiful and dry.  My eyebrows have never been so kept and the man of the house doesn&#x27;t dread shaving As much ( he has to do it Every day for work ), he used to do it After the shower but it&#x27;s just tedious that way. Now he can justify longer showers.  For the sake of clarity I will say that if you are too far awayfrom the mirror it looks slightly distorted. I say this as an oxy moron. Who is going to try to pluck or shave their face from two to three feet away? It only hurts the vain.  Fogless shower mirror. We love that you do what you say.</li>
    <li> I use this every day, it was super easy to set up and like many others have said, the only semi-annoying thing about this unit is that you have to refill the mirror with water each use.  Excellent product</li>
    <li> Awesome mirror so far. Easy to install, does not fog up, with the squeegee it is easy to clean and maintain. Due to sensitive skin I can only shave in the shower and have tried multiple mirrors that claim fogless and had yet to find one that lasted, this one is hands down the best one so far.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews but this product definitely deserves it!  I have used other fogless shower mirrors but they either 1) never stayed fog free or 2) never were clear enough to accurate shave around my goatee.  Well, this mirror solved all those problems and then some.  The water that needs added every shower keeps the mirror from fogging and it really isn&#x27;t a chore or dealbreaker in the least.  The mirror surface is excellent and you won&#x27;t have any weird funhouse mirror distortion to contend with.  The ledge under the mirror if also nice for storing your razor and included squeegee.  This product is money well spent!</li>
    <li> After a lifetime of rubbing condensation from shaving mirrors, I have found the one that really works.  No B.S.  You fill it with hot water, shave, dump it out and that&#x27;s it. It works EVERY time.  The set up was simple - before you go to bed, squirt on the silicone, press the 2 double sided tape pieces on the shower tile and tomorrow morning it&#x27;s perfect for shaving.  Some people wrote a in 4 Star negative \\&quot;Well, it&#x27;s not a glass mirror . . .\\&quot; - stop your whining! What do you do, run your nails over it while you shave?   It is nice looking, you can move it at different up/down angles, AND IT NEVER FOGS!  Is it \\&quot;too pricey?\\&quot; Negative &#x3D; look at it this way. You can spend $21. for a suction cup mirror that will totally fog up after 3 months or fog around the edges from the start, or you can buy Perfection! It is completely worth it! Say \\&quot;Amen!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> What a great idea.  The mirror fronts a reservoir that you fill from the shower head, changing the water each time you shave. Fog is created by tiny water droplets, which are formed when the colder mirror meets the warmer water (or vice versa), adhering to dirt particles. Other fogless mirrors work by putting a slick coating on the mirror, but that eventually wears off or is coated by a film that overcomes the nonstick barrier.&lt;br /&gt;This one works by preventing the water droplets from ever forming so it never wears out. As a scuba diver, I have learned a lot about fogged glass or metal, since we battle fogged masks all the time.  We solve it by super cleaning our masks or putting on the slick surface with no fog products. I wish we could use something like this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I did not give it five stars is one of the three I bought broke at the hinge which allows you to tilt the mirror up and down. That could be more robust.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and if used right is fogless.  I have told many friends to pic 1 up.Great service fast delivery and very good price</li>
    <li> Over three months later, it still works great!  Unlike all the other &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; mirrors that end up fogging about a month after you buy them - this one STAYS FOGLESS!</li>
    <li> I purchased this mirror for my hubby.  We received it very quickly and he absolutely loves it.  It truly is a fogless mirror. I was concerned that he would be annoyed at having to add water to the resevoir to de-fog it, but most of the time, he doesn&#x27;t even have to do that and when he does, it&#x27;s so easy that it&#x27;s not a problem for him at all.    Glad I purchased it.  thanks for the fast shipment!!</li>
    <li> This is one of those products that you see and wonder - \\&quot;why didn&#x27;t anyone offer something like this years ago\\&quot;?  It is affordable, works exactly as advertised (easy installation, no fogging up), and truly improves the 5-minute shaving experience each day much more than the yearly \\&quot;let&#x27;s add another blade\\&quot; campaigns by the razor companies.  Buy and enjoy - it works!</li>
    <li> I actually found this mirror in the Frontgate Magazine that comes to the house.  I googled it online to see if I could find a better deal and found it on Amazon for $20.00 cheaper by this seller... In other words - It&#x27;s the best deal!!  This was a Christmas Present to my husband.  I was so tired of all his gadgets in the shower, plus when I looked into his previous shaving mirror I couldn&#x27;t see anything.  It was crap.  We&#x27;ve purchased other little shower mirrors and they all seems so crappy.  So with all the great reviews in Frongate and on this website I knew I needed him to try it.  Needless to say.. hands down the BEST MIRROR out there.  My husband is 6&#x27;2 and I am 5&#x27;3 - so the tilt on the mirror works great!  The only bad thing was when we first got it we didn&#x27;t clean the shower spot where we were going to hang it and/or we also didn&#x27;t allow the proper drying time.  It fell off but only because he was excited.  We just picked up more of the silicone stuff at Home Depot and it hasn&#x27;t fallen off once!  He absolutely LOVES the mirror!  His other one was so bad he started shaving in the sink.. and women all know what a pain it is to clean those tiny clippings around the sink.  So its hands down a must for every household with a man who shaves!  Makes a great stocking stuffer - take my word for it :-)</li>
    <li> I purchase this for my husband to replace an old mirror for shaving in the shower.  It really works great!  The only hesitation that he has is filling the mirror with warm water when entering the shower each time.  I don&#x27;t shave every day, and don&#x27;t really understand if this is even a problem if it doesn&#x27;t fog when showering. It was a little more time to install than our old one, but I feel well worth the extra effort.  I enjoy that it has a shelf for his razor where the old one had a hook that would get bumped when I was showering, and cleaning lauching the razor into the air...yikes</li>
    <li> My boyfriend likes to shave his head in the shower but needs a mirror in order to make sure he does it right.  We recently moved and left his old Fogless Shower mirror on the bathroom wall of the last place (which, after 2 years was still securely in place).  He had tried a few mirrors before this one, but this was the only mirror that had managed to both stay on the wall and not to fog up.  We left it because we couldn&#x27;t get it off the wall.  This is why I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  I&#x27;m sure there is a way to get it off the wall but we were worried about damaging the tile after a few attempts to rip it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, we had to get the same one for our new place.  It&#x27;s been about a month and it is still securely on the wall so it appears to be the same great quality of the previous version.  Its system to prevent fogging up works great and I find myself using it occasionally when washing my face in the shower.</li>
    <li> Great product!  It works amazingly well!  Fill it before you start with the hot water and it will never fog up.  Fill it up after you start, use the squeegee once and it is just like it never fogged up in the first place for the rest of shower.  A must have for shaving in the shower!</li>
    <li> I love it. Easy to install, but most importantly it works. The shelf is nice and the squeegee gets used, but I&#x27;d buy this again, and I recommend it, based on the simple fact that it does what I need it to do, which is to stay fog-free.</li>
    <li> It is wonderful being able to let your hubby shave in the shower. No more cleaning up that messy, hair-filled sink (you know the guys NEVER get it really clean, even if they try!) I found it really great for removing my make-up-I always seem to miss some spots if I do it in the shower! I really like this mirror! It did exactly what it said it would and was simply EASY to use! I get accused of taking too hot of showers all the time, and this mirror stayed fogless. It&#x27;s a keeper for our household!</li>
    <li> I loved it! Works great, and it&#x27;s very handy in the shower, I would recommend this product to other people.</li>
    <li> Since this ingenious mirror heats up with shower water, which one adds when using it, it remains fog-free during the entire shower. The squeegee remains a valuable part of the system to deal with droplets of spray, which accumulate despite the internal heat. It&#x27;s adjustable up and down, but not side to side. Some models come with built-in lighting, provided from lights around the perimeter of the mirror. I have purchased both kinds. The lighted model has a slightly larger mirror as well. Only once did I fail to turn off the light completely (it has two levels of brightness), thereby running down the batteries. Since the unit can be removed easily from its well-mounted wall attachment, changing the batteries is easily accomplished. If you like to shave in the shower, this mirror makes it easy.</li>
    <li> I have gone through 5 shower mirrors becoming increasingly frustrated with each one because of the fogging that occurred.  This product does exactly what is promised.  I am extremely happy and pleased to finally find a shower mirror that actually works as advertised!</li>
    <li> This is a revised feedback.  I admit it, I didn&#x27;t read the directions that came with the product. Even so, this product is a much better mirror than the cheap thing I bought at a major retailer.   Gave it five stars then, wish I could rate it higher now.  In my previous feedback I said that the product did fog up but a quick shot of water cleared it right up.  In the directions you are instructed to fill the reservoir on the mirror with hot water...this is what keeps it from fogging.   After posting my first review, I was contacted by a rep from the company who very nicely and politely told me what to do. Talk about fantastic customer service!  Fully recommend this product, am very satisfied with it and the company!</li>
    <li> It works.  No fog.  Clear as can be.      Just follow the instructions.  The mirror stays up due to the silicone adhesive.      Dead simple.  The first mirror that actually stays up on the tile and is fog-free.  Every other one I have owned will do one but not the other.    The only suggestion is to offer some different finishes.  The plastic-silver framing and black mounting looks a bit 1993, but you cannot beat the functionality.      Shipping was also quick.  I actually received it the next day since I live close to the seller.</li>
    <li> This mirror is great. And such a super but basic idea. But it works. It utilizes what we&#x27;ve been doing ourselves for years. Hot water to remove fog. It holds it in a reservoir in the back and keeps the mirror fog free the whole shower. If you shave in the shower buy this today!! You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> I have owned 2 of these shower mirrors and both worked better then any other I have tried.  Does not fog up and makes shaving a breeze in the shower.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror over a month ago.  I had a problem with the packaging, not only did I get an immediate reply from the Seller, they fixed the issue and went above and beyond what I would have expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this almost daily, I do not have to fill the mirror with hot water most of the time, I just use the squeegee and go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other 5 star reviews on here are correct this is one product that is worth it.</li>
    <li> My old mirror was just a flat regular mirror and worked fine until it started getting a little messed up on the edges after 10 years.  This one is a bit more than I needed, but it seems to work.  I don&#x27;t do all the water stuff and it still works fine.  We have a Roman shower with no door (turn a corner to go into it), so maybe that helps keep the steam down a bit.  Don&#x27;t need the shelf sticking out, but can live with it.</li>
    <li> The first testimonial to this product is that I&#x27;ve been ordering from Amazon for 10 years and this is the first time I&#x27;ve written a review! I am very impressed and satisfied with this product!   The fogless shower mirror is excellent and does everything it claims to do.  I received it right away, it&#x27;s easy to install, the quality of the mirror is excellent, it&#x27;s the perfect size, and I particularly like the adjustable mirror and shelf, which holds both my toothbrush and razor.   I am very pleased with how securely it adheres to the wall and it truly is fogless!  I use the mirror daily for exfoliating and brushing my teeth, while in the shower.  My husband recently said that my complexion looked really good...the only explanation I had was that I&#x27;m now using a mirror when I exfoliate, so I&#x27;m getting better results!  I even jumped in the shower the other day to apply my make-up, using the fogless mirror, bcs I was in a hurry and my bathroom mirror was still foggy!  I&#x27;ve used other fogless mirrors before, which were cheap, small, fell off the shower wall, and had a distorted mirror...all a waste of money!  This is well worth the price!  I had high expectations, due to the almost 5 star rating, and it has surpassed all of my expectations.  Thank you ToiletTree Products!</li>
    <li> This product works perfectly when you use it as instructed. I only have two complaints about it, but not enough to remove any stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The setup is a bit annoying, I wasnt a fan of having to apply the paste to my shower walls to get this up. And once it is up its staying there, you cant re-adjust after without having to redo the whole thing. I actually havent even tried to remove it yet, I am not sure if that paste will be friendly to the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Having to fill the reservoir up with hot water and empty after each use can be irritating, even though it only takes 10 seconds.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant when ordering this mirror based on a couple of reviews I read.  I ordered it anyway assuming if the sides were slightly distorted as some had written it was still larger than any of the others on the market.  However, this mirror far exceeded all my expectations as it is crystal clear, completely distortion free and very easy to use. If the mounting instructions are followed it is perfectly distortion free.  I had intended to drill a small drain hole so it would drain out over time as one of the half sized competitors advertised but I found that was completely unnecessary.  This is the simplest mirror to use, has a large clear viewing area and with the large slide very easy to hang up either empty or full even with my eyes closed. The adjustment capability makes it useful for both me and my wife to use.  Any negative comments surely reflect on the users and not the product.  This is a fantastic product and I intend to buy another for my guest bathroom and very highly recommend this flawless fogless mirror!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this product (received a couple weeks ago).  It does not fog or fall off the wall.  Especially like the attached squeegee.  Could have used more silicone adhesive, but if it proves not to be enough, similar adhesive is available at the hardware store.  Prompt shipping as well.</li>
    <li> Been using this mirror for a few weeks and it doesn&#x27;t fog. Wish there were other colors to choose from since my 2 bathrooms have different color tiles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for quite some time to acquire a quality fogless mirror that will actually permanently stay fixed in my shower without falling unnecessarily. This is unqestionably the answer! The quality of the mirror is outstanding, and the squeegee provided helps to maintain spot-free polish on the mirror. This is a SERIOUS no-fog mirror. I&#x27;ve yet to see any hint of any fog on this mirror. The stand for the razor is brilliant as well, instead of hanging unbalanced (like most mirrors) you can actually place the razor flat underneath the mirror. The best part is the application process of the mirror to the shower wall. There is an adhesive double-sided tape AND a glue-like solution that really hold the mirror perfectly. I am extremely happy with this product and would highly recommend to anyone else.</li>
    <li> The only issue (which prevented me from giving it 5 stars) was the silicon adhesive was so hard it was unusable.  I had to purchase my own adhesive for installation.</li>
    <li> My husband realized the convenience of shaving in the shower many years ago and will never go back to shaving at the sink.  We have had several \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; mirrors in the past, and none have been as truly fogless as this one.  Since you use the water from the shower and place it behind the mirror, the temperature of the mirror and the shower are the same, thus no fog!  Great concept and it works!  No need to drill any holes, but adhesive works much better than suction cups and does not ruin the surface where it is placed.  Took the advice to buy separate fogless mirror and shower radio, which is the best advice ever.</li>
    <li> Originally worked great.  After about 10 months, it lost the ability to hold the mirror angle that I set it at so I could see myself while shaving.  If it is not filled warm water (to prevent the mirror fogging) it MIGHT stay in place.  It appears the design and/or construction is not up to daily use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought two of these, one for myself and one for my son. I like that you can use silicone instead of suction cups. I&#x27;ve never known a suction cup to not let go at some point (usually in the middle of the night). The mirror has god adjustment and the shelf and squeegee is well thought out.</li>
    <li> When I first got this I was very excited but over time have grown to not like it so much.&lt;br /&gt;Not very happy with the way it is permanent when you put it up. It does stay fog free but reminds me of the mirrors in a fun house as it distorts your reflection. A little redesigning and it may get a better rating.</li>
    <li> Have used the \\&quot;other\\&quot; fogless mirrors in the past and end up replacing them everytime.  No more.  This one puts the end to that and works the best in my mind.  If you are looking for the best fogless mirror and the best value, buy this one.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews for things, but this one deserves it.  It is well designed, simple to set up, and performs exactly as advertised. I think it is a great product,  low tech but appropriate technology.</li>
    <li> Best fogless mirror I&#x27;ve owned. Zero fog!</li>
    <li> It works great as long as you follow the instructions and fill it with water.  That&#x27;s the trick!  Otherwise, it will steam up like any other mirror.  I also like the shelf for storing your razor.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed the mirror right up until the time that it inexplicably fell off the wall and broke. It had more than enough silicone gel and adhesive on it for it to stick on.  I only had the mirror for 5 months before it broke so now I need to purchase a new one.</li>
    <li> The mirror looks and works great, but the adhesive it comes with 1) Ruins your bathroom tiles 2) Doesn&#x27;t work well. The mirror fell down after the first day eventhough i made sure to clean the tiles with alcohol and left it to dry for 24 hrs.</li>
    <li> I shave in the shower like a lot of gents ... But this thing is big and obtrusive ... Just not good</li>
    <li> My husband just asked me to buy another one of these mirror when we moved into our new place because he liked the other one I bought him so much.  I looked at a lot of fogless mirrors before deciding on this one and I know I made the right choice. It does the job the best and keeps my man happy!</li>
    <li> The fogless mirror does as it says.  So far it is still adhered to the wall and it remains flogless during use.  The reason I am giving it 4 stars as opposed to 5 is that I find having to fill it up with hot water each time an extra step that I did not have to do with the mirror I previously had that attached to the shower nozzel.  While the squeegee works to clean off the mirror, it is one more step and is necessary since the shower splashes all over the mirror.  Still it is a good product and does the job.</li>
    <li> best shaving product ever!!! The only and the only thing I can say that is maybe a bit off is that after 2 years the swivel doesn&#x27;t stay up properly but overall don&#x27;t even understand how I shaved in the past....</li>
    <li> This mirror was SO easy to install and required no tools! It is easy to use and has been so nice to have a truly fogless mirror while showering! It is simple to use to - fill the reservoir with water from the shower head and you&#x27;re good!</li>
    <li> ToiletTree&#x27;s Fogless Shower Mirror is my favorite shower accessory.  I like to brush my teeth and cleanse my face while I&#x27;m taking a shower.  The Fogless mirror makes it so much easier!  My husband loves it too because instead of standing at the sink to shave, he can do it in the shower.  Now neither of us have to worry about missing any spots on our faces.  Keep this in mind when you start your holiday shopping, it would make a perfect gift.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best shower mirror that I&#x27;ve ever owned.  My headblade and razor both fit on the shelf.  I did have an issue with the old style hinge.  I emailed the company, and got a quick reply from Kelly.  The updated part holds perfectly.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I finally gave up on my suction cup, blurry mirror and decided to purchase this one after reading reviews. I am very happy with this product. I installed it as it was written. I didn&#x27;t love the fact that I needed to use adhesive but it&#x27;s holding up well. Ok, so I warm up the shower, fill the mirror with water and actually got a little dizzy because it was so clear. I&#x27;m really very critical and will say this is a great purchase for a guy who shaves in the shower. Fantastic. The only semi-con is that it&#x27;s not necessarily simple to hang the mirror back on once it is filled with water; but, if you&#x27;re not &#x27;special&#x27;, it&#x27;s easy to figure out!!</li>
    <li> My husband shaves in the shower, and his previous shower mirror was always falling off the wall and getting fogged up. Every so often, we&#x27;d hear a loud noise, and sure enough the mirror would be lying on the floor of the shower. So, when I told him that we had the opportunity to review the ToiletTree Fogless Shower Mirror, he was definitely eager! However, I knew he was a little skeptical about how fog-free it would be because he chose to set it on a little shelf in the shower rather than affix it to the wall. (Apparently, he didn&#x27;t want it to be too permanent in case he didn&#x27;t like it!) Well, he used it for several weeks, and one day I peeked in the shower and saw that he had affixed the ToiletTree Fogless Shower Mirror to the wall!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, this product is a big \\&quot;keeper\\&quot; and a permanent part of his shower routine! We&#x27;re thrilled to report that it has never fallen off the wall. Plus, my husband loves that it never fogs up. No more rubbing on it mid-shave to try to get a clear view of his face. Other great features include an adjustable frame so you can angle it just right, a convenient shelf for placing your razor or other shower tools, and even a squeegee for wiping away water drops. It&#x27;s shatter-proof and rust-proof, so it should last a long, long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having a mirror in the shower is also handy for tweezing and checking to be sure you&#x27;ve washed off all the soap and/or shampoo. We love the ToiletTree Fogless Shower Mirror, and I think you will, too! This would make a fantastic holiday gift for the hard-to-buy-for guy.</li>
    <li> The construction of this mirror is better than others I&#x27;ve seen.  It is well constructed, doesn&#x27;t fall, and the shelf for your razor is great.  But to call this mirror fogless is ridiculous.  It comes with a squeegee that you can use to wipe the fog off, and typically I&#x27;ll have to use that 3-4 times while shaving.  Definitely not \\&quot;fogless\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Most of the reviews are very similar and most everyone enjoys this mirror as do I.  Shaving at the sink is a major hassle and creates such a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Straight and to the point:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great mirror for the price.  The first one I had lasted over two years before it started to get a little blurry and this was probably my fault for not cleaning it a proper way.  The only reason I got rid of it was that we replaced our shower.  The mount holds very, very well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does require hot water, not luke-warm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anything ever goes wrong with it, let them know.  My guess is they will replace it free of charge.  Since the president of the company responds to almost every complaint...he must care about their product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very minor gripe.  The first one I had started to strip in the back where the vertical adjustment is so it would not stay in one position.  I didn&#x27;t move it much, so I can only assume it may have been a weak part.  I propped it up with a sponge and didn&#x27;t think any more of it.</li>
    <li> cleaning lady broke after 3 months</li>
    <li> I love this mirror. The only reason it&#x27;s lost a star is because it fell off the wall, but it did not break. I might buy it again, or where I can get more of the silicone glue stuff it came with. It doesn&#x27;t fog when the reservoir is filled with warm water, plus the squeegee and shelf are nifty. Compared to other shower mirrors I&#x27;ve owned, this one is definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> My husband has tried many so-called \\&quot;fogless mirrors\\&quot;.  We have had a number of problems with them...they either fogged up or the suction cups did not stay on our wall.  It was sooo frustrating!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mirror, however, is truly fogless!  But, you must follow instructions.  If you do not use the mirror properly, it will not be fogless, just like all the other mirrors!  This one you fill with hot water and it stays truly fogless!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing we liked about it was how it attached to the shower wall.  There are 2 sticky pads and also silicone.  We had no problem attaching to the shower wall or getting it to stay.</li>
    <li> After going through few of the so-called fogless mirrors, I finally came across this product from a little promising company that I have never heard off: ToiletTree. Not a very appealing name. Still, I decided to take my chances and ordered their latest model called deluxe. Boy was I surprised and amazed how well this mirror works! Installation was a snap and so is filling it up with warm water every time before taking a shower - a small hassle well worth the final result. The mirror NEVER fogs - it is physically impossible since there is no difference in temperatures! What a simple and clever idea. Thank you very much, ToiletTree (now, if only you could change your name to be a more appealing to the general public...)</li>
    <li> Want a shower mirror that doesn&#x27;t fog and doesn&#x27;t fall down? Get this one. The no-fog feature is a simple and effective design (there&#x27;s a reservoir behind the mirror that you fill with warm water). It even has a fun little squeegee.</li>
    <li> Let me be honest here. The mirror doesn&#x27;t fog up. It actually stays clear through out the entire hot shower/bath as long as you remember to fill up the reservoir with hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, having said that, here&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t give this mirror a 5 star rating:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the mirror is not glass, it is made entirely of plastic and because it is all plastic, the image is distorted, unless you are pretty close to it. This of course doesn&#x27;t mean glass would be a better option, because if the mirror fell, you&#x27;d have broken glass all over the tub/floor. I&#x27;m simply stating that due to the fact that the mirror is \\&quot;plastic\\&quot; makes its reflection distorted.&lt;br /&gt;Also, again, because it is plastic, the squeegee that comes with it left a long scratch mark on the left side of the mirror, the very first time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s not option to hang the mirror or use suction cups; you must use the double sided tape and silicone provided with the unit, this creates a problem for those whom rent or simply do not want to leave any silicon/tape residue on their tile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit, IMO, is not worth the $30+ price tag. $15 at the most, considering the issues I described above. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> This product is pretty useful, and I&#x27;ve enjoyed it so far. The mirror is truly fogless when used properly. The razor holder is convenient, and the product is designed really well (includes a small, practically camouflaged, squeegee)  One of the only negatives about this product, however, is that it does accumulate water spots, leaving an unkempt appearance/lack of utility sans water.</li>
    <li> The mirror consists of a plastic shelf that is glued to the shower wall with provided silicone adhesive.  The mirror mounts on the shelf after filling the cavity with warm water.  A squeegee is provided to wipe drops off of the mirror.  It works very well to remain fog free as long as you change the warm water for each shower.</li>
    <li> Good mirror, easy to use and install. The installation was easy, and the silicone cement holds the mirror to the wall without slipping or falling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clever part of this item is the water reservoir on the back which prevents fogging. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost two weeks now, and as long as hot water is filled in the back, there&#x27;s no fogging at all. Shaving is much faster now in the morning, meaning more time for drinking coffee and internet ablutions instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside is the bottom tray is a bit of a tight fit for my safety razor. It still works though, so it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
    <li> It is a pleasure to buy something that works exactly as described. I have used it for several weeks. Every morning I have a crystal-clear mirror to shave in.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> i received the Fogless Mirror prompt and so far it has been great. I have searched a long time for a fogless mirror and all of them have not worked but this one is great</li>
    <li> IN SHORT:  This mirror is incredible and actually is totally fog-free if you follow the directions.  It&#x27;s worth the price if you&#x27;re hesitating like I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LONGER REVIEW:  This mirror is the last piece of equipment I needed to complete a simple, easy shaving regimen.  I&#x27;ve really run the gamut -- from disposable razors to those fancy \\&quot;safety\\&quot; razors with 5 blades, to honing and stropping my own straight razor and shaving with homemade soap.  I&#x27;ve tried so many things to get what I want and none of them were satisfying.  I love the feeling of a really close shave, but parts of my neck get irritated with safety razors, and the whole ritual of shaving with a straight razor was just too time-consuming for me.  I finally bought a Panasonic wet-dry electric razor and this mirror.  The electric shaver doesn&#x27;t shave anywhere near as closely as a razor, but it&#x27;s quick, easy, and now I can do it in the shower thanks to this mirror!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror is easy to install, easy to get on and off the bracket to fill, and the squeegee sits in a little holder on the bottom side of the mirror, out of the way.  You can tilt the mirror to a few different positions, so if multiple people are going to use it in the shower, you don&#x27;t have to worry about one tall person and one short person arguing about how high to place it.  The mirror looks like an honest-to-god mirror, even though it&#x27;s acrylic.  I&#x27;ve had \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; mirrors in the past that were made of some weird material that was really cloudy and not crisp.  Not this one.  It seems like they thought of everything and I&#x27;m extremely glad I bought it.  Shaving is now a fogless breeze in the shower!  Love it!</li>
    <li> The concept works.  No fog when you fill the cavity with warm water. But, how long will it last?  Very cheap fragile plastic.  If I had been able to see and touch before online purchase I would have not purchased.</li>
    <li> Updated September 1, 2013:&lt;br /&gt;Well, the part that holds the mirror in position has worn out again. This time it lasted about nine months. I don&#x27;t expect things to last forever, so I would not mind paying a couple of bucks to replace this piece of plastic every year since I do enjoy the mirror. The manufacturer might consider selling that piece as an alternative to the consumer having to throw away the mirror or buy an entire new unit every year - something that won&#x27;t happen at the current mirror&#x27;s price. Love the mirror, hate that it breaks so quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated June 20, 2012:&lt;br /&gt;The customer service from ToiletTree is fantastic. Within hours of posting my review about the mirror no longer staying in place the president of the company contacted me and said he wanted to make things right. They sent out a new pivot piece along with some nail clippers and a personalized apology card. I wish all companies valued their customers like ToiletTree does. The mirror might seem somewhat pricey, but it&#x27;s nice to know the company stands behind it and will make things right if need be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Old Review:&lt;br /&gt;I loved this product for the first 8 months I had it. Shaving in the shower is the way to go. Unfortunately it now will not stay in position when water is added. Since water is needed to keep it fog free I now find myself shaving with one hand while holding the mirror in place with my other hand - defeating the whole purpose of the product.&lt;br /&gt;I have always made sure to empty it when not in use, so was surprised that it wore out so quickly (I&#x27;m not an every day shaver either.)</li>
    <li> The mirror is probably the best fog free mirror I have ever owned--and I have had several over the years.  Granted to truly achieve the fog free surface, the process of filling the reservoir with hot water is a bit cumbersome.  I found that since I live in a very warm and humid climate year-round and have a bathroom that is more or less open to the outside, I do not have to fill it with water and it remains fog free.  I just use the squeegee to wipe off any excess water post shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I have rated it 3-stars is that in less than a year of use the mirror has developed a defect that I believe should not exist.  In the upper right hand corner there is about a nickel sized area of flaking of what appears to be the silver backing of the mirror.  It appears that moisture has entered the area between the plastic backing and whatever the material is that comprise the mirror and have caused the distortion.  It&#x27;s not huge and does not affect my ability to use the mirror for shaving in the shower, but I am concerned the defective area will only grow larger over time.  And since it is a mirror that is designed to be used in a wet environment, this defect should not have appeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 02-26-2015:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really have to revise my review and in hindsight give it a 5-star rating if for nothing else the company&#x27;s terrific response to the only issue I had with the mirror.  The company, in their comment to my review, states that it is not normal for the flaking to occur and has offered to replace it.  What more can I ask?  The mirror works as it is designed and except for that one flaw that developed after a few months of use, I am very satisfied with the product.  (I see many reviews stating disappointment that the mirror does not stay stuck to the shower wall.  I have an irregular stone shower stall and it is always difficult to get these types of products to adhere permanently.  So I just drill a couple of holes and fasten to the wall with concrete screws.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also add that I recently purchased another ToiletTree product--a three container shower soap dispenser.  It was expensive but it clearly is the best of the best in shower soap dispensers.  However, one of the three dispensers did not work properly, so I contacted ToiletTree customer service by email and within 12 hours had a personal response from the company  offering to immediately replace the one dispenser.  It&#x27;s nice to know that in this era of mass produced low end consumer goods, there are companies that stand out from the rest by backing their products and brand with outstanding customer service.d also add that I recently purchased another ToiletTree product--a three container shower soap dispenser.

    <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas this year (after reading all the great reviews) and he loves it just as much as everyone else. It does exactly what it claims and works perfectly every time. We have had a few &#x27;fogless&#x27; mirrors in the past and they never seem to last because they just don&#x27;t work. As long as you follow the simple instructions and fill it with warm/hot water (he just fills it when he gets in the shower) each time you want to use it, it works great. Very easy to hang and hasn&#x27;t fallen yet. Definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a good gift!!</li>
    <li> Like many I was skeptical about a mirror that doesn&#x27;t fog in the shower, but this mirror worked exactly as advertised.  It literally never fogs up and is perfect for when I&#x27;m shaving in the shower.  I love it!  I&#x27;m 100% going to recommend this to all of my friends and I&#x27;ll be purchasing more mirrors as holiday presents for my family!!![[ASIN:B003BQ6QXK Fogless Shower Mirror with Squeegee by ToiletTree Products. Guaranteed Not to Fog, Designed Not to Fall.]]</li>
    <li> Works just like the instructions specify.  For it to be \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; you have to fill the reservoir with shower (or whatever) hot water each shower day....just like the instructions say.  The silicone adhesive works fine....the tape is just to hold it in place til the RTV sets up.  You could use masking tape instead for a day or so, if you are spooked by removal of the foam pads when you move.  Not dirt cheap, but nice construction.....and generous size.  Go for it.</li>
    <li> Ordered this. Arrived in perfect order. Appeared to be a quality item. But . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a tight shower stall. With a recess on one wall at shaving height and fixtures on the other, I couldn&#x27;t find a good place to affix the product (which is not small) and so returned it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone else who has this problem or who has had bad luck with fogless shaving mirrors, I suggest an alternative: who says a shower shaving mirror has to be inside the shower? If your shower arrangement permits, hang a hand-held mirror on outside of the glass, facing in, from a suction cup. No fog issue. See photo.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products I&#x27;ve purchased on Amazon all year. It works perfectly. I would give it more stars if I could! Love this Mirror.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror after using one for many years that used suction cups, but it finally fell and broke. The ToiletTree mirror works as advertised and stays fog-free for the entire shower. I fortunately gave a little forethought to the placement of it before I mounted it and put it between the shower head and the door so I could easily reach it from the outside. I let the water get hot in the sink and fill it, and hang it back. The water is then hot from the shower, so I don&#x27;t have to wait to get in for it to warm up. I don&#x27;t need the squeegee since I&#x27;m filling it outside the shower. I am very happy with the mirror and would love to buy a more compact travel version if they decided to make one.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised and stays fog free.  As other have mentioned, the image is distorted so it&#x27;s a little like looking into a amusement park mirror.  Works well enough for a shave though.</li>
    <li> I got this mirror for Christmas and it replaced an older, smaller, stainless steel thing-a-majig that I&#x27;d had for way too long and it was basically useless at the point that I replaced it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mirror is fantastic.  It&#x27;s easy to fill and it stays fog free through even the longest showers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two minor quibbles.  If you forget to drain the mirror when you&#x27;re done using it, you&#x27;ll have to empty it before you fill it next time.  My shower is small enough that I often end up with the cold water splashing me as I empty it--not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, I wish that the shelf below was designed a little differently so I could hang razors rather than lay them flat on the shelf.  Of course that would present a problem for the placement of the squeegee, and I definitely wouldn&#x27;t want to go without it!</li>
    <li> Once I received the product I had a couple of questions/concerns.  I was contacted Steve Parisi (President of ToiletTree Products) and his level of customer satisfaction is OUTSTANDING.  He truly believes in his products and will only allow you to bee 100% satisfied!  It is refreshing to know there are sellers like this in the marketplace.</li>
    <li> Simple \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; mirrors don&#x27;t work.  This one works great!  Such a simple idea that simply works.  Thanks!    Now, about the name of your company . . . ;-)</li>
    <li> updated review. their customer service is excellent -- replaced the defective product immediately. also, their deluxe version is larger and has a light -- very convenient in low-light bathrooms.</li>
    <li> Thoughts:  * Good size mirror - I used the picture with the razor as my point of reference -   * The squeegee is very helpful  * Strong, sturdy design (It survived a fall the first time trying)  * Not sure if I can accurately say it does not fall - I installed using the silicon glue but did not wait the amount of time as described by the directions - my fault - I ended up buying Goop to glue this to the wall and it is not going anywhere now - had I followed the directions I think it would have stayed in place without the Goop.   * Very clear mirror   * Love the shelf for the razor - this is an added bonus, as the previous models I had never had a shelf.    Yours truly,  Pen Penlittle (now a properly shaved Pen)</li>
    <li> I was using several over the last 10 years. This is by far the best I have used. The only thing I would do different is get the one with the LED light around the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one stays on the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company delivered as they promised.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas present for my husband and he and I love it!  It works exactly like they say it will.  Easy to mount(it isn&#x27;t meant to be held up by the sticky tape alone, you must use the glue), love that it tilts, easy to clean (love the squeegee)and love that it has a little shelf for his razor. I also noticed from other reviews that this Steve guy really cares about customer service...so rare these days.  Great product!</li>
    <li> The mirror is a two piece product, the black stand glues to the wall and the mirror part slides easily on and off it. Handily there are two self adhesive pads to hold the mirror in place while the silicon sets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you look at the picture, the back of the mirror extends back a little at the top, this helps to scoop up more water when filling from the shower. Once filled, a quick wipe with the squeegee to remove spray and it stays perfectly clear for the entire shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some folks have mentioned the view is distorted; when filled with water the center of the mirror does bulge a little. I don&#x27;t mind this as it increases the field of view a little so you don&#x27;t have to stand perfectly in front of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With warm water in, it is just not possible for the mirror to fog. This is the best shower mirror I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Great Quality product for the money...Easy install. Now I can see myself singing in the shower...All-In-All Incredible experience....Thank You Toilet Tree!!!</li>
    <li> Works perfectly and stays on the wall.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Great value for money.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband. He likes to shave in the shower. Other fogless mirrors I have bought him last a year or two before fogging up and discoloring. He won&#x27;t have to worry about that with this one. It&#x27;s hanging in our shower. It&#x27;s made well with thick plastic so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it cracking or being flimsy. You slide the mirror off the holder, fill it with water, slide it back on, and shave.</li>
    <li> This is just one more badly flawed design masquerading as a TV screen? The image is unclear and distorted more than most of these cheap shower mirrors and I&#x27;ve tried them all over a 30 year period It&#x27;s hard to understand all the positive reviews. Save your money on this one!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome mirror does exactly what it says it has yet to fog on us yet and we have had it for a little over a month. I have bought battery operated ones in the past but it is nice to find one that I don&#x27;t have to spend money buying batteries for. The color of it matches anything which is great too and its light weight and stays to the wall great has not fell on us once. This is a must have.</li>
    <li> wow! run and pick up this mirror as quick as you can! it is the best fogless mirror i have ever had an experience with! my husband and i both love it for different reasons. he shaves in the shower, so it is extra helpful for him and i like to be able to use it while removing my make up in the shower. All you have to do is easily mount your mirror to the desired place in your shower and fill the resevoir with warm water to keep it fogless and off you go! a little squeege is included for cleaning water off the mirror after your shower. so nice! You will not be dissapointed with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I have tried many \\&quot;fog free\\&quot; mirrors over the years and this one absolutely is the best ever. It IS fog free and doesn&#x27;t  fall off of the wall like most all others do. This company put a lot of thought into the design of the mirror and the mounting  process and it shows!!</li>
    <li> There are only two reasons I didn&#x27;t give this excellent mirror five stars.       One is that I mounted mine on the wall of my bath/shower such that every time I want to take the mirror off and then put it back on (which is required every time you shave) I have to contort around to see where the bracket is -- behind the mirror.   The instructions for this mirror should strongly encourage users to mount the mirror on the \\&quot;front\\&quot; wall of the shower so that when you are standing outside the shower you can see behind the mirror and easily take the mirror on and off.        If I had more of that glue stuff they send I would move the mirror but they only include enough for you to mount it once, securely.    The other issue is it is sort of a pain to have to empty the mirror after every use.  It would be nice if there was a valve at the bottom of the unit so that we could open it after the shower and the water would just flow out.    Of course I probably wouldn&#x27;t care about that if I had the mirror mounted in the \\&quot;right\\&quot; place.    All in all, highly recommended and I wish I&#x27;d bought one years ago.</li>
    <li> I admit I was skeptical.  This purchase was one of those &#x27;one in a million&#x27; that have a problem initially and end up being a terrific customer service experience. When I originally purchased the mirror, it arrived without the soft silicone in the package. After contacting ToiletTree directly, I was emailed by their Director of Marketing; after explaining the issue and providing my mailing address, she sent me out the tube of silicone directly and also included a hand written apology for the inconvenience (a very nice touch, especially these days) and a small gift to thank me for my patience was also included which was a delightful surprise.   Once I had the opportunity to mount and use the mirror in my shower, I can happily say it more than lives up to its reputation and five star reviews. The mounting instructions are clear and concise, the mounting is sturdy and won&#x27;t damage the tile in your shower should you have to remove it, the extra features (the shelf for your razor, the built-in squeegee for cleaning the mirror face that has it&#x27;s own storage on the bottom of the shelf) are an absolute space-saving boon. And most importantly - the fogless mirror is actually exactly that - I followed the incredibly simple directions and it stayed fog-free through some pretty rigorous testing. (It remained the only fog-free surface even when the steam reached near sauna level in the room.)    This product is more than a great deal - the slightly higher price is absolutely worth it. And the company&#x27;s customer service is absolutely exemplary. I couldn&#x27;t recommend a product more highly than this.   I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to purchase this again, and am looking forward to exploring this company&#x27;s other products as well. If you shave in the shower, do yourself a favor - do it with this mirror. Five stars!</li>
    <li> Outstanding shower mirror.  This is the third shower mirror I&#x27;ve purchased.  This one really works.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> little smaller than I thought it would be, but it works. not sure I like the process of filling it with water</li>
    <li> The first time I used it, it was a bit strange to fill the reservoir behind the mirror with water.  However, since I bought this mirror I have not had a bit of fog form on the mirror.  Just fill it up from the showerhead, wait 10 seconds and enjoy a fog free experience for the rest of the shower.  In addition to the quality mirror, the Toiletree company has responded to my questions promptly (yes I asked a question about a shower mirror).      When I asked about using the Scrubbing bubbles automatic shower cleaner with their fog free mirror, their answer was an honest \\&quot;I don&#x27;t know\\&quot;.  However, they asked me to try it out and let them know.  In fact they asked me to perform a trial and post my results; and if they are not positive they offered to replace my mirror for free.  As of right now, I havn&#x27;t seen any negative results from using the cleaner.    I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mirror for my husband and is is great!  He mounted it next to our shower head for easy refill.  It took us a minute to figure out how to dump the old cold water from the mirror reservoir but found that it comes off easily from the mount bracket.  You do need to stand pretty close to the mirror for the best image.  The razor platform is very handy.  Overall, this is a high quality product that we are very happy with.  I think we will get one for our guest bath!</li>
    <li> Most shower mirrors attach to the shower using suction cups.  Suction cups don&#x27;t always hold well with temperature or humidity changes.  And that&#x27;s only if the item being held up is light.  Fogless mirrors (the good ones) aren&#x27;t light.  You&#x27;ll find out why below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If used correctly, this mirror will not fog, and will not fall down.  The mirror is detachable from the base.  The base is held to the wall of the shower with two-sided tape and silicon gel.  The tape is there to hold the base in place while the silicon dries.  Once the base is attached to the wall, it&#x27;s not going anywhere.  The mirror has a reservoir behind it that should be filled with water from the shower once it&#x27;s at the warmest temperature you&#x27;re planning to use.  That keeps the temperature on both sides of the mirror about the same and, voila, no fog.  The mirror is easily attached to the base, and the upward/downward angle can be adjusted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shelf can hold a razor and comb. A squeegee slides out from below the shelf to wipe water drops from the mirror.</li>
    <li> HI. I TRYED THIS PRODUCT, AND IT WAS EVERYTHING I HOPED IT WOULD BE AND MORE, ITS WELL MADE , EASY TO PUT UP, AND IT STAYS UP, I LOOKED FOR A LONG TIME TO FIND THE RIGHT PRODUCT, ITS JUST GREAT, YOU WELL LOVE IT, AND I&#x27;M NOT GETTING PAYED TO SAY THIS . THANKS BILL...</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for his Christmas. He has been using it for over a month now and it is a great product. Even without water in the mirror it takes a while to fog. He shaves in the shower and he has had no problmes with fogging at all. He fills the reservoir with water and the mirror stays fog free. I like it because it can tilt and I can see it if I need to as well. I highly recomment this product. Much better than the ones that attach to the shower head. You can position it anywhere you like in the shower!</li>
    <li> My Teen son has this mirror in his bathroom, and it&#x27;s been up for a good 3 month now; installation was super easy and we haven&#x27;t had a problem since. It&#x27;s still tight on the shower wall and he uses it every day; He brags about it constantly that it never fogs and how durable it is. We really enjoy this product and the price can&#x27;t be beat. Wonderful product we would recommend to anyone if they are in the business for a new shower mirror that actually works!!!! Thanks ToiletTRee for a job well done</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a mirror. It does exactly what it claims to do.  It doesn&#x27;t fog and it stays on the wall.  I&#x27;m sure there are better (and worse) products out there, but for $30 you won&#x27;t be dissapointed.</li>
    <li> works exactly as advertised - does not fog. mounting is easy. I have owned 2 fog-free shower mirrors previously and they do not come close to comparing. I will never purchase a different brand of shaving mirror.The included squeegee is essential and works perfectly. Easy, inexpensive, and functional.</li>
    <li> This is the FIRST mirror I&#x27;ve ever bought that does BOTH of what hit promises - no fog and it doesn&#x27;t fall.  Well worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2GD599HDY0SYM]]I was given a ToiletTree Fogles Shower Mirror to review. I use it in my daily life now and I really like it. I would have positioned it better had I thought about how the shower would be spraying water all over it while I shaved. Luckily I can easily do that with the reusable silicone adhesive.[...]</li>
    <li> I have tried about 4 different fogless mirrors from bed bath beyond, wal-mart, target and all of them got ruined and were never really fogless. My wife found this one on amazon and got it for me for Christmas and it is AMAZING!!!! This is really the only shower mirror you will ever need again. Would like it if there was an LED on it so it could light up my foamy face before shaving but definitely not a huge deal as it is TRULY FOGLESS. Great product guys.</li>
    <li> This shower mirror works better than any I have ever used. It is simple to install and simple to use. Filling the reservoir keeps the product completely fog-free and the squeegee does a great job of keeping the mirror clean,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything you could ask for, and quick shipping, too. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This mirror works as advertised.  Simply fill it with warm water before or during your shower and the fog disappears in less than 30 seconds.</li>
    <li> Overall the product stands up to its guarantees.  The mirror remains fogless because you need to fill it with warm water before each use.  Not a big inconvenience just not a process I was expecting.  The doesn&#x27;t fall because it is adhered with silicone which takes 12 hours to dry.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly.  Simply fill up the reservoir with warm water and you can see perfectly in the shower.  Additionally, the adhesive holds up the mirror and it doesn&#x27;t slip like most that use suction cups.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have tried various fogless shower mirrors and this is by far the best.  It gives a very clear image and dosen&#x27;t fog up like others I have tried.</li>
    <li> Great product, doesnt fog like promised.  Filling the reservoir full of water is a bit of a pain, but it works better than any other i&#x27;ve bought.  Hopefully the mirror is treated with something and doesnt build up calcium or whatever like the others do...</li>
    <li> Review after about one month of use    Pros-looks good, good sized mirror, is definitely fogless if you follow the instructions. Reasonably priced. No suction cup view.    Cons-Need to fill with warm water each time you want a fog-free mirror--not hard, just a hassle (it does the job though).  Would like the shelf to be a little larger to hold another razor better.    Did not use the silicone and tape provided.  We built a new shower and did not want residue or potential scratches.  I actually used 3M Command tape strips as I have had success with other surgfaces with clean removal.  Holding up fine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several so-called fog free mirrors and they always fail after a while. The genius is in the simplicity - why re-invent the wheel when the laws of physics are right there to help you. With a well to store hot water, the mirror simply cannot fog over while you are in the shower. Just remember to empty the well when you are done so you don&#x27;t stress the support. Great product</li>
    <li> I have been through multiple \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; mirrors and they all end up fogging eventually.  I read the reviews on this one and was amazed how many positive responses there were.  I have only had mine for 3 weeks now, but it does EXACTLY what I need it to do!  If it does fog a little, the squeegee does the trick.  My only complaint would be that it has no light on it.  Some of the other ones in the past, even if they weren&#x27;t as good as this one, had a little light which helped while I was shaving.  Otherwise, this is perfect for shaving in a steamed shower and still be able to see! The price is great, too.  I have always paid over $30 to $40 for the other ones that didn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving in the shower for as long as I can remember.  I have been through half a dozen so called &amp;quot;fogless&amp;quot; mirrors over the years.  All of them are worthless and subpar.  The Toilet Tree mirror is UNBELIEVEABLE!  Its philosophy of using hot water behind the mirror is absolutely brilliant.  No matter how HOT I make my shower, NO FOG ever clings to the mirror.  It is crystal clear and with a .5 second wipe after the shower, no water spots have adhered to it at all.  If you do not buy this mirror if you are in the market, you are a true fool.  THIS IS THE REAL DEAL.  Lastly, it is only $25.00!!! Are you kidding?  I spend twice as much for worthless mirrors in the past.  Stop looking and buy it already, you wont be sorry.</li>
    <li> Like alot of people, I have been disappointed with other so-called \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; shower mirrors over the years.  They&#x27;re either not really fogless or they are for only a couple uses.  Then they leak.  I decided to try this product and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!  This is truely a fogless mirror.  I just fill the reservoir with the hot shower water and within 15 or 20 seconds I have a crystal clear mirror.  And it stays that way. I&#x27;ve had it for a little over a month now and it&#x27;s perfect!  It also is firmly attached to the tile wall. I&#x27;ve been telling eveyone I know about this incredible product.  Kudos to the company owner for coming up with this idea.  I sure wish I had done it!!  Now I need one for my 5th wheel.</li>
    <li> I will add my 5-star rating to this product, and here&#x27;s why. --After years of buying shower mirrors at the big chains (Wal-mart, Target, etc.) only to have them hopelessly fog-up and become dirty after a few months, I was skeptical of the promises made by this product. I think the cheesy grin on the face of the guy in the product photo (and I found out later on the box the mirror comes in!) does not help. Toiletree should think about changing that. After a few months now of using this product, I can say it is the best shower mirror I&#x27;ve ever had. It&#x27;s easy to use and bases its &#x27;fogless&#x27; claim not on some chemical coating or composition, but on the mere fact that by adding water to the space behind the mirror, you bring the mirror itself to the same temperature as your shower, and thus it cannot fog. When there is no temperature difference between the air and a surface, that surface will not fog or attract condensation (or give off steam for that matter). So, it really works completely as advertised. That&#x27;s rare. For those who have brought up the relatively high price tag for this item, you have a point. However, in the past 15 years, I have probably spent $70-$80 on bad mirrors that did not make me happy, so to spend $30 on a mirror that does make me happy seems worth it to me. As long as I can keep this one in good working shape, I should never have to buy another one.    But speaking of keeping the mirror in good shape, the only tip that I have for anyone who buys this mirror is to resist with all your might the urge to wipe the mirror off with your hands. The little squeegee that&#x27;s included with mirror is ok and gets the mirror as clean as a squeegee can get anything clean. However, I still had the urge to wipe off water spots and smudges. Don&#x27;t do it! This just puts a coating of your skin oils on the mirror and makes it worse. Just take a clean washcloth, dampen it in your shower and clean the mirror off.    I would definitely recommend this mirror to people like me who have had years of frustration with shower mirrors. This product will really make your day.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaving mirror.  It was easy to install and never fogs up when used properly.  I have tried many shaving mirrors over the years, and this one is the best by far.</li>
    <li> Had another product similar to this that was suction cup based.  Eventually fell and broke.  This unit is great.  Fasten with silicone caulk, wiper for mirror, removable to fill with water and good mirror size.    You can&#x27;t go wrong with this unit.</li>
    <li> Tried many, this one is awesome for shaving in the shower. Guys, I have a ceramic tile shower with random pits all over it to make it look like stone. There are few spots for suction cups to grab. This thing ships with a generous amount of clear silicone glue (more than enough), and strips of tape to hold it in place while the glue dries. Fill the little tank with shower water, swipe the mirror with the included squeegee and it NEVER fogs up. I have hard water so I make sure the mirror is dry when I get out of the shower to prevent spots. It tilts up and down, has a shelf for the razor, sticks solidly to the wall, and never fogs... it does NOT shave you, but it does everything else you need, and properly. The supplied squeegee even has a holder built in, but the squeegee is weak for cleaning the water off after the shower. Let me say again, if you fill the tank each time (under 15 seconds in my shower), and use the squeegee to clean it dry after every shower, it will never fog and you will always have a clear view.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;18 Months later.... This mirror is still excellent, with one minor exception.  The tilting feature employs the familiar plastic knobby extrusions that lock when they hit grooves in the mounted piece.  Over time, the knobbies wear down and it will not stay in your favorite location.  I got some silicone glue like what came with it, and glued it in the posistion I like best, erasing the irritation.  It has still never fogged on me, the mirror is still 100% perfect.  I squeegee off the water after each shower, it never needs any sort of cleaner, no water spots, etc.  Go for it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a truely fogless mirror for a while. Shaving in the shower provides a very close shave without any of the razor burn. I don&#x27;t even need shaving cream anymore. Just shower like normal, then turn the heat up about as hot as you can stand it, the hair seems to just fall off. Doing this without a mirror can make for some interesting side burns. Not anymore thanks to Toilet Tree.</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this shower shaving mirror.  I have had a couple (another brand) in the past that I purchased from Bed, Bath and Beyond that lasted for about 6 months.  This mirror has been great.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror based on the great reviews I&#x27;ve seen here at Amazon. I&#x27;ve used countless suction cup mirrors in the past and they always fell off the tile after a few days or the mirrors faded. This mirror lives up to its description and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The silicon adhesive and double back tape works perfectly. I have no doubt the mirror will stay put for years to come. I&#x27;m confident the mirror can be removed and placed elsewhere (if needed) without much work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The size of the mirror is perfect. I use it to shave in the morning and never need to move back and forth to see. Just the right size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* This mirror NEVER fogs up. Add hot water to the back of the mirror and place it back on the holder. The holder is not flimsy when you replace it on the holder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Pricey, but you&#x27;ll make up the cost and more by not buying mirrors over and over again. Well worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line: Buy this if you&#x27;re tired of cheap mirrors that let you down every time. This product is the real deal and you won&#x27;t be disappointed. I rated it 5 stars because 10 isn&#x27;t available. :D</li>
    <li> Cool product, big and easy to view. My problem is you HAVE to fill it with warm water EVERYTIME you use.  Seems a bit of a waste of water and energy.</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror. I wish I had found it sooner so I didn&#x27;t waste money buying a new \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; mirror every 2 months. I wan&#x27;t thrilled about gluing it to the shower wall in case I wanted to take it down, but it works great and has not budged. Considering that I paid $15 at Bed Bath and beyond for a mirror that only worked for a few weeks, this mirror seems fairly priced at $30.</li>
    <li> I received my mirror, followed the directions, and installed it in my shower. It makes shaving much easier, and I don&#x27;t end up making a mess in the sink.  My unit was installed at the beginning of October and I have had no problems with it. I also found it impressive that the president of the company would take time to look at customer reviews and care about customer feedback!</li>
    <li> This item works well. Discription did not include how it works. Must fill item with warm water to make it foggless. Not a problem, just a surprise. Otherwise happy with item.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this fog-less mirror -  have been using for approx. two months. I&#x27;m new to shaving in the shower, so this is the only one I ever bought.     More than I wanted to spend, but worth it after reading many, many reviews. If anyone has problems with this mirror, they did not followed the instructions for locating, mounting or use.    Buy another one? You bet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned a few shower mirrors in my day, and my two biggest complaints have been that after time, they fog up, and/or they fall off the wall.  I&#x27;ve owned this mirror from ToiletTree for over a month now, and I&#x27;m thoroughly impressed.  The silicon that came with the mirror holds the mirror snug to the wall.  I have a tiled shower and I didn&#x27;t have any trouble getting the mirror to stick.  When it comes to the fogging issue, it is impossible to get this mirror to fog up.    The only downside is that sometimes I forget to pour the water out.  The next morning, that water is COLD when I go to refill the mirror. :)  UPDATE August 22, 2011  I&#x27;ve been using the mirror for a few months now, and I only have one complaint.  It seems that the \\&quot;gears\\&quot; that control the tilt of the mirror have worn out.  Now, when the mirror is filled, the weight causes the mirror to tilt all the way downward.  If I try to tilt it up, it doesn&#x27;t hold, and it tilts downward.  Without the water, the mirror is still adjustable, but not when the mirror is filled.  While I&#x27;m disappointed that the mirror does not hold it&#x27;s position, it&#x27;s still fog free.  UPDATE September 27, 2011  Today I got home from work, and I had a package waiting in the mailbox.  It seems that ToiletTree read my August 22nd update.  Inside the package was a handwritten apology from Kelly Parisi, Director of Marketing, and a replacement part.  This speaks volumes regarding ToiletTree&#x27;s customer service.  Without me asking, they resolved my issue to make sure that I was pleased with their product.  Thanks Kelly!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the Fogless Shower Mirror with squeegee by ToiletTree. It works great! I replaced a Sharper Image mirror that worked OK, but this product really does stay fogless. I really like the way it attaches to the shower wall. Most use suction cups that seem to never stay up for very long. This product comes with a small tube of silcone adheasive that you apply to the back of the bracket. Wait 12 hours for drying...and you have a great fogless mirror!</li>
    <li> I received my order in a very timely fashion and had no problems (unlike some of my other experiences with other vendors). Was in perfect shape. Overall, satisfied.</li>
    <li> The Fogless Shower Mirror works perfectly. The adhesives that connect it to the wall are very strong, yet I&#x27;ve had no problem removing them when moving. The anti-fog feature works as intended as well, requiring only pouring warm/hot water into the detachable mirror. This is simple to do, the mirror slides off/on to the mount easily, and it requires only a few seconds of letting shower water pour into the top to fill up. As an added bonus, I&#x27;ve moved twice now, and both times when I e-mailed ToiletTree&#x27;s customer service to purchase new adhesives to mount the device, they sent it to me free of charge immediately.</li>
    <li> Easy to hang -- everything needed is included in the box. Good clarity, fogless, easy in-and-out of the bracket.     Regarding the less than positive reviews, it helps if you read the instructions :)</li>
    <li> I have bought several shower mirrors and this is by far the best one to date. It seems every 6 months I have had to previously replace one an after owning this for 3 months I can see not replacing it for some time.  Buy this with confidence.</li>
    <li> So far so good after a few weeks use.   As long as you fill it with hot water and use the provided squeegee it works well. I think this mirror is a keeper.  Definitely worth a try if you want a good shower mirror.</li>
    <li> This has to be the BEST fog free shower mirror on the market. I have purchased several over the years and when I am in need of a new one I keep going back to this brand. You will not be disappointed by this mirror. It&#x27;s great for shaving in the shower, no nicks or cuts!</li>
    <li> Most products seem to be marketed in such a way that promises much more than is actually delivered- from the \\&quot;You&#x27;ve tried the rest now try the best\\&quot; pizza boxes to the empty phrases and terms you see and hear like \\&quot;best quality\\&quot; \\&quot;supreme\\&quot; and \\&quot;deluxe\\&quot;, but this fog-free shower mirror genuinely delivers the goods by doing what the product literature says it will do and then some. I don&#x27;t get excited about products very often, or write a lot of reviews, but this mirror meets my desires so perfectly I have to share about it!  The water reservoir does keep the mirror from fogging, truly. I have never had a problem seeing my face, and I really love to shave IN the shower- there is nothing quite like it, especially now that I have my first ever shaving brush, but the real problem with every other mirror I&#x27;ve tried has been that suction cups just don&#x27;t adhere permanently and I have busted more than my fair share of mirrors- either the glass or the plastic where the suction cups attach- when they fall, which they inevitably have, they crack somewhere! This mirror uses an adhesive pad that STICKS to the shower wall, so if you have textured shower walls, it might not work so well, but my walls are smooth as glass and it stays as if it was built in from the beginning. I doubt I&#x27;ll ever need to remove it, but if I do, it may leave something behind or even tear away some of the material the shower is made of, so firmly is it glued to the wall- I don&#x27;t know, and hopefully won&#x27;t need to find out, but it certainly isn&#x27;t meant for a temporary installation, so don&#x27;t bring it to a hotel or you&#x27;re leaving it when you check out!   The squeegee is a fun little bonus (my 10 year old discovered the convenient built in holder for it) and, if you are at all conservation minded, you can use the still warm water in the reservoir to splash on and hence rinse your face so you needn&#x27;t waste it!  Yup. Great product. Glad I found it. Glad I bought it. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend and it works perfectly. I&#x27;ve played with it in the shower and once you fill with water and use the included squeegee, it&#x27;s amazing! I&#x27;ve even accidentally hit it and it didn&#x27;t fall or break even filled with water. I was definitely skeptical but it&#x27;s turned out to be a useful and cost-efficient Christmas gift!</li>
    <li> Great product! I bought this for my husband after he tried two other mirrors, one from Wal-Mart and one from Lowe&#x27;s. He loves this mirror!! It&#x27;s important to pay attention to the other reviews and DON&#x27;T fill the basin completely full with water. This will cause too much weight on the mirror and it may break.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Fogless Shower Mirror for my father for Christmas - he loves the product.  He said the product is just as the description states in that it does not fog - even in the hottest of showers. For the first time in a long while he is able to shave in the shower without cutting himself because he is able to see what he is doing.  In addition, the instructions for wall mounting are very easy to follow.  It didn&#x27;t take long to hang the mirror.  Would hightly recommend this product for purchase.</li>
    <li> I have bought my husband numerous supposed fog free mirrors and this is the only one that truley works!!!! Totally worth the money!! You will not regret this purchase.</li>
    <li> This mirror is perfect!  My husband loves it and it doesn&#x27;t fog AT ALL!  The mirror is nice and big and tilts easily and is solidly stuck to the wall.</li>
    <li> I have owned quite a few in shower shave mirrors, this one beats them all hands down.  I glad I read the other reviews on this product.</li>
    <li> Just remodeled our master bath and we were looking for a mirror to add to the shower that would blend with the new look.&lt;br /&gt;The mirror arrived as scheduled without damage and it looks great. The tiny squeegee works unbelievably well and leaves the mirror spotless. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This mirror works just as advertised.  One tip: Choose your mounting location carefully.  I pick a spot too close to the showerhead, and there was alot of water splatter (but NO fog).</li>
    <li> My wife purchased this mirror based on the excellent feedback it has received and I&#x27;m happy to say I&#x27;m adding to those accolades.  The product works as advertised and installs in minutes (with added drying time for the adhesive).  What I&#x27;m especially happy about is that it adjusts/tilts up and down.  I&#x27;m kind of tall and an eye level install on the wall I wanted would have placed it right right in the towel rack. I was able to place it below that and simply tilt it upwards a notch or two and it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> This is the best fogless shower mirror!!  No gadgets to malfunction like lights and clocks. It is so clear you don&#x27;t need a light. it&#x27;s the best.</li>
    <li> This mirror attaches in a friendly way without drilling or permanent gluing anything.  Or, tapping into the plumbing on your shower head.  It works perfectly and simply.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror. The mounting is simple and sturdy. The mirror is well made, but has a very slight distortion. Overall it works as advertised  - it doesn&#x27;t fog up!</li>
    <li> The mirror is fog free and I love it; but after using it for a few months, it leaks.  Water drips out of the seam on the \\&quot;tank\\&quot;.  I will continue to use it, but I can&#x27;t recommend it now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - 1/29/14 The seller sent me a replacement.  It&#x27;s rare to find such great customer service in this day and age!  Thank you truly standing behind your products!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Easy installation&lt;br /&gt;-Sticks great, has never fallen off or even seems loose&lt;br /&gt;-Works as described. Simply fill the compartment and the mirror will stay fogless.&lt;br /&gt;-Has made shaving in the shower faster and easier&lt;br /&gt;-Has a nice shelf for storing the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-I couldn&#x27;t come up with anything.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my husband as a last minute Christmas gift.  I&#x27;m very pleased to say that he is thrilled with this fogless mirror.  I was little concerned because we have purchased \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; mirros before but after reading other reviews, decided to purchase and see if it really worked.  Well it&#x27;s now the end of January and the mirror has worked perfectly.  Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> The product offers the best shave, the best shower mirror and a very satisfied customer.  It&#x27;s easy to install but unlike the suction cup mirror this product stays put!  Easy to fill up container for a fog free close shave.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband so he wouldn&#x27;t have to get out of the shower and shave and then head back into the shower. He really likes this product as he states \\&quot;it truely is fogless\\&quot; and loves the fact that it has a little shelf to put your razor. If you follow the directions it works really well. He has used it since Christmas...</li>
    <li> they wear out eventually.  We have a 2nd home and wanted an additional one of these.  my husband shaves in the shower.  He love this.</li>
    <li> I have been keeping a shower mirror in each shower for the last 15 years or so, and I have 4 showers in my house. As such, with these occasionally breaking (usually due to a fall after the failure of a suction cup or two), I have been regularly (once or twice per year) checking the \\&quot;state of the art\\&quot; of shower mirrors. I am pleased to report that this one is my favorite yet.     First, it adheres to the wall in a more permanent way (although the silicon glue used to attach it to the wall is easily removable) than the others, and I do not expect to be picking the pieces of one of these mirrors up from the shower floor in the future.    Secondly, its elegant design is such that the mirror is easily removed and re-attached thus allowing easy access to fill up the reservoir with warm water in order to avoid fogging.    Third, the anti-fogging approach mentioned above works beautifully, and doesn&#x27;t require the occasional re-application of anti-fogging material, which I never have ever bothered to do anyway, and    Fourth, it&#x27;s nicely adjustable such that people of a wide variety of heights can easily use it.    The only tangible improvement I could recommend would be the addition of a battery-powered light useful enough to assist with shaving.    Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It does exactly as it promises. By gluing the mirror to your shower wall you avoid the main problem with most mirrors- slipping suction cups.</li>
    <li> My 3rd \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; mirror...this one is the best by far. A bit of a pain to fill with hot water each use but worth it.</li>
    <li> This is a nice mirror, does not fog up at all, you just have to put hot water in the reservoir before every use. I love it.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend who uses it every day.  This product is simple to mount, easy to use, and really works!</li>
    <li> Yeah, it stays fog free, which is the main thing.  What kept me from giving it 5 stars:  First, the plastic seems cheap; we&#x27;ll see how it holds up.  Second, it&#x27;s not that easy to slide the mirror back on, I usually have to make a couple attempts to get it to slide into the notch, since you can&#x27;t see what you&#x27;re doing.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get the hang of it over time; it just could have been better designed, to guide it back into the notch in a more effortless manner.  And third, my squeegee came out of the manufacturing process slightly curved, meaning you can&#x27;t just make one clean swipe.  It takes about 4 or five swipes, guiding the curved squeegee to get all parts of the flat mirror surface.  Overall, it seems like made a cheap product to cash in on a pretty simple idea.  But yeah, it stays fogless, so whoopee.</li>
    <li> This was a present for my husband. He is very pleased with it. It mounted to the shower wall easily and works as intended. His only criticism is that he wishes it had a light.</li>
    <li> love this product.  It easily installs in the shower.  Add a little hot water to it and you get the cleanest shave ever!</li>
    <li> This mirror came quick, was super easy to install and works like a charm. The ad makes it look a lot bigger than it actually is but I guess I could of read the dimensions for the exact size, but either way it is plenty big. Really does stay fogless the entire shower too. Super pleased with it for the cost. Would def recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit of project to get it hung, but stays nicely when glued in place.  A bit of a task to fill/empty every time but it certainly doesn&#x27;t fog up like others.</li>
    <li> my husband loves this product and so do my sons, the mirror doesn&#x27;t fog up and it has a little ledge to put his razor on. Perfect for men who shave their face in the shower</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a fogless mirror that works and I have finally found it.  This is a great product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I&#x27;m glad I went with this ToiletTree option because the item itself is well made, functions exactly as it should- and in addition their customer service is fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have no doubt- if you want a device like this, you can&#x27;t go wrong here.  The price is right and the quality is more than you&#x27;d expect.</li>
    <li> As advertised and on time. Clear instalation instructions. Above all works like charm; better than I expected. 5 stars all around.</li>
    <li> We just received this mirror after having a different fogless mirror that always fogged up and repeatedly fell off the shower wall.  So far, so good!  Looking forward to using this mirror for a long time.</li>
    <li> First off, now that it&#x27;s up, it does work as described.  I had a hard time getting it mounted as the little tube of mounting cement was dried up.  I originally used some caulking/cement that I had but the mirror kept falling down.  I finally used some liquid nails and now it&#x27;s up permanently.  However, something must have broken during the falls as the mirror tilts down every time I place it back on filled with water.</li>
    <li> I had the same product when I lived in China. Now back in the US I ordered the same product again. In both cases the mirror worked as advertised and I find it a great option to get shaving done during the shower rather than wait and mess up a clean sink.</li>
    <li> I received my product and everything looked great, was excited to get it installed.&lt;br /&gt;Then i noticed I was missing the tube of glue to stick it to the shower wall, I contacted amazon and they told me there was nothing that could be done and that i would need to send it back and buy another one.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed to say the least.</li>
    <li> The mirror looks nice and definitely keeps the fog away. However, the glue that comes with it does not work well. The mirror fell off a week later even though I followed the instructions. I bought a different glue and it works fine now.</li>
    <li> I purchased this over a year and a half ago. My previous metal shower mirror was a rusty mess after that long, but this one is still going strong. Unlike my previous mirror that used a fogless coating that wore off over time, this one uses the warm water from your shower, so it really does last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mounting tape it came with was definitely insufficient, however. After the mirror fell off the tile a few times (never broke, just came loose and fell), I used some strong epoxy, and it hasn&#x27;t budged since. Once mounted, the mirror unit can swivel up and down, and it can be removed to fill it with warm water or to clean it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only minor complaint is the prominent ToiletTree logo that can&#x27;t be covered easily. It&#x27;s not a particularly attractive name or logo to stare at every day.</li>
    <li> I bought this product thinking it would wear out like the rest, but it is great.  Just fill it up, use the squeegee and take a nice long shower without any fog on the mirror.  No other product beats this.</li>
    <li> My husband is in love with this gift.  It definitely does not fog up!  He has such a better shaving experience because of the in-shower mirror!</li>
    <li> The mirror works well. I have only had it for a week, so I cannot attest to the longevity of the mirror, but it seems like it should last. I did not give it five stars because the unit is plastic and a bit small compared to my previous mirror, which lost its fog free ability after a few months.</li>
    <li> A little time to get the mirror set up and functional, but well worth it! The only additional thing that may improve the overall product would be to figure out how to add a showerproof light to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, an item I highly recommend...genius idea!</li>
    <li> Works very well.  First sensable shower mirror I have ever used . . . and I have used lots.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Had problems with the Silicone.  Was hard in tube.  Company sent me a new tube right away!   Good Customer Service.   Mirror has worked great since then.</li>
    <li> This is directed to those who use mirrors for shaving in the shower.  To start with... the mirrors I&#x27;ve purchased prior all used suction cups (which lead to them falling 5-6ft. to the shower floor) and they all fogged (always had to cup water into my hand and splash it up against the mirror).  This mirror however is different.  For the application it tells you to clean the area with a little bit of alcohol and then you are able to apply a silicone gel to the back of the main unit and stick it to the wall.  I let it sit over night and it was necessarily sturdy.  The second piece has a reservoir in the back that you fill with water (I do this while standing in the shower because the water is already hot).  Vuala.  Take your handy squeegee which inserts right below the razor platform and squeegee the mirror and it&#x27;s very clear.  I saw another review where someone had mentioned being in a wheelchair, so I wanted to add that the mirror is adjustable for both downward and upward rotation which compensates for different height levels.  Once you&#x27;re finished just lift off the \\&quot;second\\&quot; piece and dump the water.  This is a quality mirror.  It&#x27;s nice that I&#x27;m now able to shave certain parts of my face that other mirrors had always troubled.  A suggestion for any further advancements to the product would be to add an \\&quot;exit door\\&quot; for the reservoir such that you would not have to dump the water by removing the attachment.  Other than that I do recommend if you or someone you know is in the market for a non-fog mirror to purchase this mirror.  And I will recommend this product in the future.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product, and I had only one small problem, of which I emailed them about, and they were very quick and very courteous about correcting that problem. I can only say good things about the company, and I would be happy to do business with them in the future.</li>
    <li> Simple design makes for perfect shower mirror.  Would recommend this product.  There is no reason to spend more money for this type of product.</li>
    <li> My partner really enjoys this product.  So much, that he changes his facial hair style every week... it&#x27;s funny.  This mirror is convenient and even helps me shampoo in the morning.  I got it as a V-Day gift and he loved it!</li>
    <li> Works as described.  Has been the only &amp;#34;true&amp;#34; fogless mirror.  Install was simple.  Great idea to include a shelf for a razor and built in squeegee.</li>
    <li> great mirror for shower</li>
    <li> Excellent so far. Easy instructions to follow. Was able to stay put on the tile wall of the shower. Suction cups would not stick with other mirrors. The mirror works great and it really is fog free. I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t think of a better, more quality mirror that doesn&#x27;t fog up in the shower regardless of the money.  It may be slightly daunting to glue something to your shower wall or tile.  But once you get over the permanent nature of the installation and actually do it, you&#x27;ll be glad you did.  This thing works just as advertised.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and it does work as advertised and is a very good produt.  However, it says the following  Allow 24-hours for the silicone adhesive to dry before attaching the mirror to the bracket.  -Fill mirror with clean shower water before each use.  -To prevent spotting on the mirror surface, clean with clean water and provided squeegee.  -Do not clean with any liquid glass cleaners.  -Do not use abrasive cleaners, as they will scratch the mirror glass and frame finish.  So how do you actually clean it, if it does get water spots, etc.  It says no liquid glass cleaners, what kind of cleaner should you use?</li>
    <li> I have tried many of the standard store-bought mirrors over the years - all were cheaply made and did not perform the desired function.  Most of them had reflections reminiscent of the old fun-house mirrors.  This one, although not cheap, provides a very clear and fog-free reflection every morning.  I like the little squeegee, although a swipe with the towel at the end of my shower works just as well.  I have been using the mirror daily for over a month now and would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I shave my head and have had many \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; mirrors over the years.  This is by far the BEST one ever.  It is a much bigger mirror than any I have ever had and it actully remains fogless.  I installed mine in less than 5 minutes.  I did however bypass the 2 sided adhesive and silicone provided and used 3M Command strips (3 total) instead.  The 3M strips intall much easier, was ready in minutes and if for some reason I have to remove the mirror, I know that the strips will come off easily and not leave any residue.      If your looking for a FOGLESS mirror that works....THIS IS IT!!!!</li>
    <li> I shave in the shower every other day including my head so a good quality mirror is essential.  I was a little concerned about the unit adhering well to my shower as my tile is not smooth.  Other suction cup types have fallen off my shower door at night and set off our alarm so I was looking for something to mount on the wall.  I followed the preparation directions exactly and have had zero issues.  To keep it clean, I use the squeegee after every shower and have only needed to use soap on it once to get a little grime off of it (after about 6 months).  One trick to using the squeegee is to go slow.  I was doing it too fast, which left streaks.  If you go slow, the water has enough time to collect on the rubber and create a water free finish. Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this great quality product.</li>
    <li> After owning a couple of cheap fogless mirrors, I am happy to say this product is worth every penny.      When I get in the shower it seems to have stained, but the squeegee works wonders.  After I fill it with hot water, I pass the squeegee once, and it is crystal clear.  You don´t need to clean it with anything else.    Easy to set up and works every time.</li>
    <li> I have been buying these mirrors for over 10 years.  I have been looking for a good one for over 10 years.     I think I have found it!  There are just a few things you care about;   1) The quality of the mirror (So you can see detail)  2) The mirror stays fogless    3) It stays on the wall   This mirror succeeds on all three criteria.  As a bonus, my wife even thinks it is good looking!   The dollar cost is reasonable compared to other choices.  The other \\&quot;cost\\&quot; is the 10 seconds it takes to fill the mirror up with water from the shower, which is what keeps it fogless.  Given the options, it is well worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I am completely satisfied with this mirror - even with, and maybe because of, the \\&quot;fill with hot water\\&quot; step required for it to work as \\&quot;guaranteed.\\&quot; It installed with ease. It has stayed where it belongs. It tilts to useful angles. The enclosed squeegee clears spots smoothly. Perhaps, one small gripe: no \\&quot;hooks\\&quot; to hang razors for oneself and one&#x27;s significant other(s) - just the small platform below the mirror that accommodates one razor alone.</li>
    <li> Finally a shower mirror that doesn&#x27;t fog.  I&#x27;ve bought several shower mirrors and none were as good as this one.  The only thing is getting used to emptying the pocket in back of the mirror when finished using it.  Otherwise,  it&#x27;s fantastic!!    Additional note:  After 3 months of use, the plastic part that allows the mirror to swivel up and down broke, so now  the mirror faces the floor.  Not good!  Not fantastic anymore.  Too bad.  I thought I finally found the perfect shower  mirror, but the cheap plastic ruined it.  Doesn&#x27;t anyone make anything that lasts anymore??</li>
    <li> I have been useig the ToiltTree mirror for about two weeks and it really works.  I have a regular mirror in the shower that I would put soapy water on to help keep it from fogging but that did&#x27;nt work so well.  The ToiletTree mirror has taken it&#x27;s place and it works great every time.</li>
    <li> I have tried countless shaving mirror products that have promised to not fog up in the shower. This is the only one that has really worked! It affixes to the shower wall easily and you fill the mirror reservoir with hot water from the shower spray. The heat from the water equalizes the temperature of the mirror and prevents condensation. It takes about :15 seconds and voila...a fog-free mirror. My shaving will never be the same again. Trust me...this thing really works!</li>
    <li> I bought the fogless shower mirror three months ago, and I can not install until last week, because I was remodeling my bathroom.   Once the mirror was installed my housband and I, use it every time we take a shower (twice a day) and works espectacular!!!   The instalation is very easy and stay in place very hard. I&#x27;ve been bought about four fogless mirror before and this is the only one that really works.   I love the size and the adjustable bracket is very confrotable for different people sizes.  You will be very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> As suggested on a previous review, drill a tiny hole in the bottom and the water will empty itself slowly.   Works perfectly!</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my old \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; mirror.  The old mirror had a light but the battery finally died.  It lost its fog free function ages ago.  Never had problems, even with suction cups - only fell off once in over 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, this mirror is a better product.  As long as the instructions are followed, mirror remains fog free (use warm/hot water and clean after use).  After dealing with splashing water on the old mirror for so long, this was a true surprise.  It really does remain fog free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is this - I believe this could be the best shave mirror period.  The only thing it is missing is a light.  Such a good product, just missing one small essential item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 1-18-14:  Purchased this back in 2011.  So it really did work well for years.  Never fell down and it stayed fog free.  After this much use the ratcheting hinge finally wore out.  When I place water in it the mirror slips down to the lowest angle position.  Can&#x27;t complain - worked well for so long it was definitely a good buy.</li>
    <li> I give this a 4.75 stars.  My ONLY complaint is that the mirror is very slightly distorted.  I assume the mirror material is plastic to save on cost which is passed on to the consumer which is ultimately good.  Maybe it&#x27;s a safety thing, which is also smart.  They should look into it, but it&#x27;s definitely not a deal breaker.  Like I said, the distortion is very slight.  I like the fact the mirror tilts just in case you mount it a tad to high or low OR of you have people of multiple heights using it.  Bottom line, it is worth the money and I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.  My main goal was fog free and it nailed that need.  Install was easy, it&#x27;s nice and secure on the wall, the shelf and squeegee are an added bonus. I&#x27;d like to see them offer a lighted version of this mirror.</li>
    <li> This is the mother of all fogless shower mirrors. Image is clear, it doesn&#x27;t fog up, no scratches, sturdy, mirror tilts to adjust for height (i&#x27;m short and my bf is taller, so it&#x27;s nice i can also use his mirror without having to get on my tippy toes) I just don&#x27;t know how i&#x27;ll mount it again if we move. the mirror is glued with double sided tape and silicone to the wall.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a month and a half now and I like it. If somehow I managed to break this thing, I&#x27;d buy another one right away. The image is clear and it stays fog free. The mirror is a little distorted when you stand back from it, but you&#x27;re not going to be using it at Mount Palomar. It is far clearer and less distorted than any stainless steel mirror I&#x27;ve seen. It is very light and easy to put up. It could be improved. It is a hassle to have to empty it, so I drilled a tiny hole in the bottom at one end. I pour very hot tap water into it and it drains itself and stays completely fog free for a 10-15 minute shower--maybe longer. The squeegee is practically useless. For the price it could have a real squeegee with rubber instead of the flimsy plastic. The mirror sticks out of the wall about 2.5 inches, so if you have a very small shower, you might bump an elbow against it and it has some sharp corners on the tray. The price is a bit high, but it has no competitor. I&#x27;ve never seen a product so cared for by a company president. I hope Mr. Parisi sees my criticism of his great product as constructive.  UPDATE: I had to bump this up to 5 stars from 4. After reading my review the company president offered to send me an improved squeegee (see the comments). I got it two days later and it is a great improvement. Amazing. It was a very small matter, but I got a personal note from the marketing director of the company (who happens to have the same last name as the president). All businesses should be like this. I wish them great success.</li>
    <li> This is the best shower mirror ever.  We have tried many from the least expensive to the most expensive (in excess of $100) and this mirror by far stays fog free the length of my husband&#x27;s shower/shave.</li>
    <li> I prefer to shave in the shower but up until I hung this mirror I used the \\&quot;feel method\\&quot;. I bought this based on the user reviews and am very pleased. From the description, I knew it wasn&#x27;t glass before I bought it so I didn&#x27;t expect the clarity of a glass mirror but its still very clear. If you follow the simple directions it works as described. If I was king, I probably would make it a bit larger and loose the shelf. Other than that I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace my old shower mirror. Reviews were stellar and decided to give it a try. Followed the directions to install mirror base and used it for a week. Worked great and I couldn&#x27;t have been happier, that is till one night it came crashing down in the shower and broke. The adhesive gave out and the entire base fell to the ground cracking. Overall good concept but adhesive does not work. If it would stay put on the shower wall would be great.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product about a year ago. After 6 months of owning it, the mirror surface began to erode and the hinge mechanism used to adjust the angle of the mirror weakened to the point where the mirror would only stay in place angled very high or very low (not very practical). I called the company and told them the issue and they sent me the replacement parts (which arrived within a day or two) for free. They also included a personalized apology/replacement note in the replacement packaging. I was really impressed by their customer service. The product works great and I&#x27;m ordering a second for my second bathroom. At first I thought $30.00 was too much for this product, but you are also paying for customer service and support which, should you need, will be excellent.  A few tips:  * Try not to readjust the angle too much. It wears down the plastic hinge and may result in the issue I described.  * Empty the water after showering so that you don&#x27;t wear down the hinge.  * Use the included plastic tool to wipe the mirror down after use. It will help extend its life.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best Fogless Shower Mirror around at any price, but I didn&#x27;t realize how dark my shower was until I tried to shave.  Now I am going to try and figure out a way to get more light on my face.  I highly recommend that you buy the Deluxe version unless you have a very bright shower.</li>
    <li> Great product and it truly is fog less once you add in hot water.  Very easy to install and the size is perfect.  I recommend this product for all guys that shave in the shower!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband (and a Merkur razor) for this past Christmas and I have to say thanks! He now shaves every other day instead of every 2 weeks!! We have a small bathroom and it is much easier for him to shave in the shower rather than over the sink. This mirror hasnt fogged up and the steam in the room gets excessive, so i was quite surprised! Thanks again for the great product!</li>
    <li> My husband and I hung this mirror together per the directions.  It hasn&#x27;t moved an inch and seems very stable.  The mirror does not fog and the squeegee works great.  He seems very satisfied with it.  An additional feature that I didn&#x27;t realize it had was that the mirror tilts vertically.  Delivery was quick and packaging was in-tact.</li>
    <li> If you want to a fogless shower mirror, there is none better. Follow directions to mount and follow directions to use- done! Did not want something you run shower water threw, something simple and that is what you get with this product. Bought two, one for home and one for the cabin. Will never buy a different shower mirror again,wish I had this along time ago .  Update; 12/20/2012 Not sure how long I have been using these at home and the cabin. Just wanted to say that after some time- this is the best you can get for a shower mirror. 3 minutes to mount and 10 seconds to fill each time you use it- and you have a great shave. What more could you ask for. Update 3/20/2017 Needed a new one after six or so years. The new mirror is better than the ones I liked. The mounting system is improved and the mirror looks even better than it had been. I have used for over 7 years and just replaced the first one in my home, the other is at the cabin. I think this is the best you can get. I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> Received product quickly and my son loves it.  It attached to the shower wall easily and he says it works very well.  Would buy again for next son!</li>
    <li> Very impressed have owned other fogless mirror&#x27;s and would rate this very hi with the ease of installation  With mirror staying fog free the entire shave  shave</li>
    <li> I have tried several other shower mirror types including one with \\&quot;suction\\&quot; cups.  (Please understand that the suction applied by these cups is temporary and you will frequently be picking the mirror up off of the shower floor.)  This is no longer a problem with this product offered by ToiletTree.  The mirror is very easy to install and is of high quality.  Your reflection is clear and true.  Also, the inclusion of the squeegee is genius.  (At first I didn&#x27;t like the concept of having to clean the mirror with a squeegee but it is very simple and handy, plus the squeegee can not be noticed when stored.)  If you are looking for a great shower mirror (why else would you be on this webpage?), then look no further.  It costs a bit more, but you certainly get your money&#x27;s worth!  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Great item!!! I bought thsi item as a gift for my husband. It really does not fog up, just add shower water. Super fast shipping.  I would highly recommend this item....</li>
    <li> Everything was quick and perfect.  I have not one complaint.  It came quicker than estimated and was packed professionally.  The item itself works great and I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time, as described, and works just like advertised - adding the hot shower water really seems to make all the difference, as compared to the fogless one we had previously. We have also gotten into the habit of using the squeegee when we get out of the shower, so there are no water droplets left behind therefore eliminating the water marks on the mirror that build up over time.</li>
    <li> I was not disappointed in this purchase for my husband...we replaced countless mirrors that did not work and this design and quality gets an A plus in comparison--it is a bit of a pain having to put warm water in the back hence the four star review..but I don&#x27;t think you will find a better mirror for the price (it may seem higher priced than others-you DO get what you pay for--trust me)...until someone invents something better, this is in my opinion the BEST choice (again for the price)! We haven&#x27;t tried the LED lights--maybe next year, we would buy again!</li>
    <li> Spending a little more gets you a lot with this mirror. The size of the mirror is perfect for shaving and any other face care needed in the shower. I like the little shelf for my razor. The only reason it gets 4 stars from me is maybe there could have been a hook of some sort to hang a washcloth or nail brush. Also, I tried using the adhesive package to mount it, followed the instructions to the T and it still wouldn&#x27;t stick on my acrylic shower wall. In this day and age, I don&#x27;t know why it came with silicone in a tube for mounting. I cleaned it all up and got the heavy duty VHB mounting tape by 3M. Much better option for mounting so if you are going to buy this, don&#x27;t bother with the enclosed mounting materials and just get some heavy duty mounting tape. Works like a charm!</li>
    <li> Best shaving mirror I&#x27;ve ever owned and I am hard to please. Had a problem after a while with the plastic \\&quot;pivot\\&quot; piece between wall bracket and the back of the mirror. Called ToiletTree Customer Service and they shipped a replacement the same day... great hassle-free service in addition to a great product.</li>
    <li> But better late than never, right? I love how this mirror is so reliable, with it&#x27;s double silicone &amp; tape fixture, and how simply filling up the cavity with warm water prevents fogging. Now if I could just do something about my blasted hard water...</li>
    <li> I can see PERFECTLY, even during a hot shower pouring over my head as I shave with another fantastic product from Amazon, my Norelco SensoTouch 3D. [[ASIN:B003V37ZDS Philips Norelco 1250x/40 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver, Black]] As an Engineer, the theory of back filing with water to even the temp makes sense but as a consumerI figured the product was a gimic.  Nothing could be further from the truth. I have never written a review so if this sounds trite - sorry. But I must boast about being able to take a hot shower, while shaving. I like the light although not sure what the difference is in the tow light setting but since I use natural sunlight in my my shower - the sun is not up when I need to so the light helps me shave.  The only thing missing is music, that I just solved that problem by placing an order 5 mins ago for the Sangean H201 shower radio.[[ASIN:B000I3F91O Sangean H201 AM/FM Digital Shower Radio]]  The only complaint I have is waiting for a product that simply makes sense so why didn&#x27;t I think of this design!  I promise you - this also makes a fantastic and surprising gift.  PS - suggest using the infamous VELCO strips to secure the base so when you want to rotate the angle the mirror is rock solid on the wall.  Happy showering and you will be that fairest of all. (and I was worried about coming up with 20 words).</li>
    <li> This product is simple to install and use , is affordable and works perfectly. It has exceeded my expectations. I will buy it as a gift for friends and family.</li>
    <li> It fogs up immediatley!!  And does it repeatedly.  Plus it doesn&#x27;t light up which I would&#x27;ve liked.</li>
    <li> I have wasted a lot of money on fogless mirrors over the last 15 years and so many of them were useless after only a month or two .  this is the first one with a design that makes perfect sense.  Based on the positive reviews I ordered it and am happy to say it lives up to the hype.</li>
    <li> I love our Fogless Shower Mirror!  It was easy to attach the base to the shower wall with the soft (removable) silicone and then the mirror fits right on easily and is adjustable which is great in this house since I&#x27;m just barely 5&#x27;1\\&quot; tall so I can angle it down at me and Chris can angle it up at him.  All you have to do is when you get in the shower fill up the mirror with water and place it back on the base.  At first I was thinking &#x60;why can&#x27;t a shower mirror just BE without us having to do something&#x27; but seriously, it takes about five seconds to accomplish.  There is also a squeegee to clean water droplets off the mirror and a little shelf for your razor to sit.  This could not be more user friendly and best of all it WORKS.  It&#x27;s the first one we&#x27;ve had that really works and is so easy to use.  I can easily recommend this to you guys if you take care of your face care or shaving in the shower.</li>
    <li> REALLY NOT WORTH THE MONEY. you must take it off its mount fill the back wih hot water each time and irt works so so</li>
    <li> I love this mirror&#x27;s performance.  The negatives I have read here like having to empty and being hard to place back in position were easily handled with a few days of practice.  I use a cup to fill. Forgot to empty? Just put in three times the water and let it flush out the cold water.  Or empty when you notice the cold water and refill with warm.  Best fog-free mirror I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But three stars because I did fall off the wall.  I had it up with the supplied silicon caulk.  Failure was between black plastic of mirror base plate and the supplied clear caulk.  I had to peel dry silicone off the tile to prep for rehanging.  I did everything by the book the first time and the bond just failed.  I am hoping it was bad caulk that came with the mirror and not an indication that I am going to have to rehang this thing once a year.  Any way, I will be hanging with name brand silicone caulk this time and maybe that will make a difference.</li>
    <li> This was a birthday gift to my son, and he is very pleased with&lt;br /&gt;it. This mirror was easier to attach than the old one.</li>
    <li> My husband wanted a mirror for the shower so I read the reviews and decided to try it.  This works just as it says it does.  Great product. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> i got it almost a week ago so far its perfect, although the silicon tube was half solid when i got it so i couldn&#x27;t use all of.  i guess have to wait and see if it stays there.</li>
    <li> The mirror does exactly what it advertises. Provided you follow the simple instructions and actually fill the reservoir before using the mirror is completely fog free. The included squeegee is a very nice addition as in the past I&#x27;ve had other mirrors that accumulate water spots that you can&#x27;t seem to remove after awhile. Initially I thought that the $30 price tag was a bit steep but considering a \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; shower mirror at a Target/Walmart is typically nearly half the price and needs to be replaced after a few months I think this mirror is an excellent investment. It was quick and simple to install and the ability to tilt is another nice feature. I have not used the built in shelf. It would certainly fit a razor but I&#x27;m not confident I wouldn&#x27;t accidentally knock it off as the shelf would not fit much else. If anything goes wrong I will update my review but to date this mirror has performed exactly as stated and I&#x27;m completely satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> So it had been said -- that it could not be done. \\&quot;Thou shall always be cursed to never seen thine face amidst the hot stream of the water-dragon that cleans us,\\&quot; so my elder said. Could it be true? Could there be no way to ensure a close, clean beard-shaving wherever the hot rain scorched my body? Lo and behold, I come across this gift -- forged, no doubt, by the gnomish engineers deep within the most arcane of labs. The device works! Crystal clear mirror, helpful ledge, flawless design! They are truly blessed.  Truly yours,  Hengest Scylf Thorkelin, Lord of the War-Song</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product.  Stays up well, and absolutely no fog!  The other day I took an hour-long shower (ridiculous, I know) -- the ceiling was dripping all over the place, but I didn&#x27;t even have to use the squeegee for the mirror.  Amazing!</li>
    <li> Sure it has been said many times, but this is by far the best in shower mirror for shaving. I have no complaints whatsoever. Given the price of razor blades, complaining about the price of this mirror is just silly. Buy it.</li>
    <li> Works well. Fill it with warm water and it will stay fog free. It is durable also - I have dropped it several times with no damage.</li>
    <li> Does not fog up. Works great. I only gave 4 stars because I have to fill with water. But not a big deal. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have had this mirror for about two years now. Use it every single day. Could not be happier and I think I am going to order one for everybody in my family for Christmas. Do yourself a favor-snatch this up and love it.</li>
    <li> I use to buy a shower mirror from bed bath and beyond and seemed like every year they would get totally trashed.  I&#x27;ve had them all and they are all junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this product seems like a winner.  It&#x27;s all plastic, which is the only reason why I woudkn&#x27;t give it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to fill up the mirror with hot water to keep the fog from forming on the glass.  I think this feature sets this apart from other \\&quot;shower mirrors\\&quot;.  Futhermore, it comes with squeegee so the water doesn&#x27;t stain the glass post shower.  I think the combo of these two features will make for a solid product.  It things change, I&#x27;ll update this post.  HIghly recommend so far.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have ever written a review of any product online so please bear with me. But I believe the superb product and customer service offered by ToiletTree warrants my taking the time to say something positive. I purchased their fog free mirror after going thru countless other mirrors of the same kind that failed in every instance. I was skeptical about ToiletTree&#x27;s guarantee that their mirror never fogs, but I was simply desperate. Well, when I got it I was blown away over the first month with how the mirror refused to fog up no matter what. I simply could not believe it.  Six months later I noticed a glaze building up on the mirror that I could not get off with water, as I was afraid to use any detergents of any kind. I called ToiletTree to get suggestions on cleaning. But when Kelley, the support person heard what was going on she immediately told me that what I was describing was unusual and that she would immediately send me out a replacement mirror free of charge. TALK ABOUT GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!  I told her in the meantime I will go and use some detergents or solvents to try to use my old mirror while awaiting the replacement. She told me to try and clean the mirror with White Vinegar before using any detergents of any kind. I did this and had to call her back to report that my mirror looked brand new. The White Vinegar cut right thru the soap build up and had the mirror looking as new as when I brought it. And, as represented, the mirror continued to remain fog free, but this time minus the dingy build up of soap scum that I allowed.  I have since learned that to prevent soap build up apply a light coat of car wax on the mirror and that should remedy that problem. Soap scum has nothing to do with the fog free aspects of the mirror.  I asked Kelley to put me on ToiletTree&#x27;s mailing list and alert me on the introduction of their new products because for the first time I found a company that put out products that live up to their claim----along with great customer service</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with installation.  I followed the directions included to hang the mirror inside the shower exactly as printed.  The next day (more than 24 hours after setting the mirror), and only one shower, it fell off the wall.  There were problems with the adhesive; the right adhesive did not stick and when mirror fell it was still stuck on the adhesive on shower wall; the left just let go.  Now I have two gobs of adhesive just stuck to my shower wall.  If not for this I would have given this mirror 5 stars because for the one shower it was used the mirror remained clear and fog free.  Unfortunately its now sitting on a shelf in my bathroom.  I have to scrape the adhesive off the shower wall somehow, and figure out what to go purchase that would allow it to remain hung on the shower wall.</li>
    <li> hmmm......  Not to sure about this thing.  This is my first shower mirror and I&#x27;m not overly impressed.  Trust me, I applied the adhesive correctly and I fear the thing is going to fall off the wall.  This weekend I am going to remove it and place additional 3m two sided tape.  If you buy one, plan on adding some additional tape.</li>
    <li> This product works exactly as promised. Installation was very simple - the hardest part was deciding the best spot for it.   Installation - It comes with double sided tape and tile safe silicon for installation. Before I bought it, I was concerned about the silicon and whether or not the mirror could be easily removed if I ever needed to remove it. I was relieved to find that it is, in fact, removable and will not damage the tile.  It took me about 3 minutes to install.  Use - I was also concerned it might be a pain to empty and fill it with warm water each time but it turns out to be not a big deal at all. It&#x27;s designed in such a way that getting it back on is dead simple. Great accuracy isn&#x27;t required because the slot it slides into actually guides the mirror into place. If you&#x27;re worried about the effort involved in using it, don&#x27;t.  The thing simply works. Dump out the cold water and fill it back up with warm water. It takes just seconds. Use the little squeegee that&#x27;s provided if you want a mirror completely free of any water drops.  Maybe $30 is a little more than I would have like to have paid, but it works so well and I think it will last for so long that I have no concerns about having spent the money. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Works as advertised, simple to install and I like how it looks.</li>
    <li> My husband likes to shave in the shower.  Our previous mirror was diaster.  It fell a lot (suction cups) and got hard water spots.  This one is really clear and works great.  The squeegee is nice to keep the spots from forming.  Make sure you have the right height and spot when installing because you only have one chance.  It&#x27;s adhered so well that we might have to sell it with the house:)  I would say the only thing that would be nice is a hook so I can hang my sponge on it.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it is said to do. NOT FOG! Easy install, no issues. Mirror is clear with no distortion. Wish I had found this a long time ago. Would have saved a lot of money.</li>
    <li> I learned the benefits of shaving in the shower early on, so I&#x27;ve gone through many different shower mirrors. Most have had suction cups which somehow always seem to fail in the middle of the night. Since most shower mirrors are not glass, they do not shatter, but the plastic housing does break apart after frequent falls on the shower floor. This mirror is different in that it uses a different mounting system - not suction cups. It uses a silicone adhesive and double sided tape to adhere the mount to the wall. If you follow the simple instructions, this mirror should not fall off. Of course, it&#x27;s important that you clean the surface where it will be mounted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other issue with shower mirrors is dealing with it getting fogged up. Although many mirrors state they are fogless, they are typically just treated with a coating that eventually wears off. What interested me most about this mirror was the unique method it uses to keep the mirror from getting fogged. Before using, you just fill the back of the mirror with hot shower water. It takes about 5 seconds to do, but beats having to constantly throw water at my old mirror. I have never had this mirror fog up. This seems like a simple idea, but the execution was genius. The fact that they also included a small squeegee shows how much thought was put into its design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before purchasing the ToiletTree mirror, I read many of the reviews on here and was pleasantly surprised to see that company makes a concerted effort to help customers with any issues they may have with the product. This says a lot about the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great mirror which seems to resolve the two main complaints of shower mirrors, unreliable suction mounts and fogging. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Smart product, works great</li>
    <li> i have tried different ones of these .. this by far.. is the best ...  works perfect every time</li>
    <li> I was skeptical after reading some of the reviews.  Not sure what product those guys received, but mine rocks!!  Crystal clear shaving in the shower now.  I&#x27;m only disappointed that I didn&#x27;t buy it sooner.  While recently using, I had to second guess myself if I was even using hot water to shower as not one single droplet was on mirror.</li>
    <li> Works great and holds to the wall with silicone gel so I don&#x27;t have to worry about it falling.  Adjustable is great for different members of the family at different heights.  Fill it with water so in never fogs and empty it when you&#x27;re done.  Best shaving mirror I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
    <li> Hi, This mirror works great!  Attached to tile wall with no problems, sturdy, doesn&#x27;t fog.  Very pleased after many years of wanky fake fogless mirrors...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some suggestions to the company to make it even better:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Perhaps you could add a little \\&quot;ramp\\&quot; to the \\&quot;female\\&quot; receiver slot on the wall mount- to help guide the \\&quot;male\\&quot; post into the slot.  I find that, because this connection is being made blind (behind the mirror), it can be a little hard to line up the male and female slots, which sometimes results in the male catching on the lip of the slot, or missing it entirely.  Seems like the molded top part of the female receiver slot could be widened and sloped, rather like a funnel, to better \\&quot;catch\\&quot; the male.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Along the same lines, if you made the male post on the back of the mirror \\&quot;double ended\\&quot;, that is- exposed and rounded the top edge of the post to be symmetrical to the bottom- it would allow the mirror to be mounted UPSIDE DOWN, which would be a great option for storing the mirror in between uses so that the reservoir could drip dry.  (My mirror is mounted directly below my shower head and the empty reservoir will sometimes partially fill with drips from the head afterwards, possibly leading to a mildew situation- it&#x27;d be great to be able to store the mirror upside down to prevent this!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Please consider adding a cutout to the bottom shelf, to allow a razor or toothbrush to be hung!  A simple 1/2\\&quot; circle drilled close, and open to, to the edge would allow a razor to be securely stored.  My razor has fallen a few times just balanced on the shelf...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope these ideas might be inspiring!  Thanks for the great product, it is filling a real void in the market!</li>
    <li> I have been an avid shower shaver for 20 years. During that time I have gone through probably a dozen shaving mirrors. Expensive ones (like Sharper Image), cheap ones (Target) and everything in between. Nothing ever worked long term, particularly in dealing with the fog issue.   This one surpasses them by a huge margin!   It does everything as advertised. Filling with water is a breeze and the unit is the perfect size, shape, etc. And no more fog!!  Look no further, the Toilet Tree mirror is the best.</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror. Works well, as long as you follow the directions and fill it with warm water!!!  We like the little wiper it comes with too to clear off the mirror of water drops.  The item came in perfect condition and fast.  Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> Works as advertised, though the squeegee may not be as effective as you hope.  If you follow the product instructions on refilling the water compartment each time though, it won&#x27;t even be needed.  The silicone gel used to help attach/hang this mirror is quite strong (after attachment, I cannot remove it with my hands without fear of breaking the mirror or damaging the tub wall) so be careful that you attach it where/how you want it the first time.  If you&#x27;re a perfectionist or one of those people that can&#x27;t stand minor imperfections, make sure you use a level while mounting it instead of eyeballing it - I wish I had...</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product.  I bought it for my boyfriend for Christmas 2010 because I got annoyed with his shaving gel ending up all over the bathroom sink.  While he thought it was a lame gift at first, after a month, he told me it was the most useful gift he received, &amp; that he never would have bought it for himself, but he&#x27;s really happy to have it.  I even use it in the shower sometimes to make sure I get all of my make-up off.   I decided to buy it for my two brothers for Christmas 2011 because they make a mess of the bathroom sinks, too.  They love it as well because it makes shaving easier for them, but their girlfriends love it even more!  No more cleaning the facial hair around the sink :)</li>
    <li> This is the best mirror i have ever used in the shower. I have tried a few of them but this is the first one that is fog free and I love it. The shave is so much better in the shower.</li>
    <li> This thing works great. Have been using it for a couple of months now and I have never seen a better mirror in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy shaving in the shower. This is the only true &amp;#34;Fog Free&amp;#34; mirror I have been able to find.</li>
    <li> I just recived the Fogless mirror by Toilet Tree from Amazon, and so far I like this mirror very much.  It is a true fogless mirror, and as long as fresh water is added in the mirror reservoar it stays fogless.  The mirror was very easy to install with the provided double-sieded tape and silicone and the mirror is easy to take out and put back in the bracket.  The shelf on the bottom of the bracket is good to hold a razor, and the squeegee works all right as well, you will probably need couple of swipes to get rid of the water on it.  So far so good and looking forward to using this product.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic fogless mirror. I purchased this mirror for my husband nearly 2 years ago and it is still perfect!  This is about the fourth one that he has had. The other mirrors were purchased at Brookstone and only worked for maybe 6 months before losing the fogless function or getting scratched up.</li>
    <li> It worked fine for a while but the hinge keeping the mirror at a preset wore out pretty quickly, making it difficult to use. I have to prop something up behind it when it is filled with water. Overall good idea but poor execution on the plastic hinge which is kind of a deal breaker.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had three other shower mirrors, and this one is best for what it does.  Only thing missing is light, but I don&#x27;t need that for my shower.  This mirror is fogless, doesn&#x27;t move, stays neat.  When you put the mirror in, be sure you are not wearing shoes to put it at the correct height when showering.&lt;br /&gt;It has been installed for months, and still fogless.  However, the pivoting device has worn out twice even though I never pivot the mirror.  The company replaced it once. When the mirror began to pivot downward due to the weight of water in the mirror pan, I just drilled a hole through the pivot device and base, and inserted an unbent paperclip.</li>
    <li> This is a terrific product. It works exactly as described. Actually, this is the second Fogless Shower Mirror by ToiletTree that I&#x27;ve purchased through the Amazon site. Nothing wrong with the first mirror. However, workers who were retiling my shower tore the mirror off the old tile and threw it away. Dog-goneit. The Fogless Shower Mirror takes much of the \\&quot;chore\\&quot; out of shaving. I almost look forward to shaving. Nah.</li>
    <li> The mirror mounted easily on the wall and seems to be relatively secure, which is the best feature of this product.  However, the mirror is not at all fogless.  We followed the instructions to fill the reservoir with water but it is still fogging a lot.  I would not recommend it if you are truly looking for a fogless mirror.</li>
    <li> Works just as advertised. No fogging.</li>
    <li> I have owned multiple shower mirrors over the years.  None are as nice as this one.  It is easy to use.  Just pre-heat your shower, as you would before getting wet anyway.  Then fill the reservoir and squeegee the mirror surface.  It will remain fog free throughout your shower.  No maintenance is necessary.  No gels or solutions to coat the mirror with.  It does seem to have a minor distortion to the reflected image but this problem is easily compensated for by the hassle-free, fog-free mirror.  I have not come across a better product in this price range and heartily endorse it!</li>
    <li> Great product!  Works as expected and truly stays fog-free in the shower.  Easy to install and feels very sturdy.  Mirror was shipped fast and arrived faster.  Would buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> The Fogless Shower Mirror was very easy to setup and great to use. I recommend it for everyone who likes to shave in the shower.</li>
    <li> Simply the best shower mirror out there.  I&#x27;ve had it in my shower for 2 plus years and it still works great.  Never had any other shower mirror even close to that long.  If the product engineers are reading this there are only two things I would improve on.  One is make it attachable via suction cups instead of epoxy.  Quality suction cups have a pretty good grip and I&#x27;m sure they would hold this mirror up no problem.  If someone would ever want to remove this mirror the epoxy would be a bear to get off.  The second is that my mirror is starting to chip at the top and bottom.  Since it&#x27;s at the top and bottom it doesn&#x27;t really affect anything just something to look into.</li>
    <li> Put this up and now I love shaving in the shower :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived without the adhesive to affix it to the tiles, but they quickly sent that out as well.&lt;br /&gt;Great customer service!</li>
    <li> It actually works! I have had four &amp;#34;fog less&amp;#34; mirrors and not one worked. This is easy and works great.</li>
    <li> Outstanding mirror.  This is by far the best fogless shower mirror I have ever used (and I have gone through many).  Just add warm water to the reservoir and you are good to go.  I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated 11/12/2015  This was a great mirror before it fell off the wall.  The adhesive separated from the mirror (adhesive is still on the wall) and the mirror hit the floor of the shower.  Besides the adhesive failing, the mirror now will not defog even when adding water.  I was trying to hold this by hand while I shaved. This was an outstanding product until this happened.</li>
    <li> This product is great. I just carefully followed the Directions and It works great, no problems. the mirror only has a tiny amount of \\&quot;distortion\\&quot; when I move forward and backward or sometimes side to side. but it is great that it is plastic and unbreakable. Shaving in the shower is the best way to shave, a very close shave. I highly recommend this product! I will only shave in the shower from now on, and I am able to shave my head as well, and it is easier with this product. Thank You.</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly and is working well so far.  Simple enough to use.  Can&#x27;t speak to durability as I have had for only 3 weeks.  Slight inconvenience to have to fill up the reservoir and then replace mirror unit on wall and then remember to empty it after use, but it becomes second nature.  Overall a good solution and and a well executed product.</li>
    <li> This mirror works absolutely perfect.  I&#x27;ve been using it for some 3+ years now with NO problems.  Fill it with warm water, squeegee it off and it provides you with a great fog free reflective surface for shaving.  One of the few products in my life that I am overjoyed with and can honestly say that if it broke I would buy again with NO hesitation.  Nuff said.</li>
    <li> Great mirror! The top of it is open, and you just fill it up with hot shower water each time, making it fog free. We have large (24&amp;#34;) tiles, so we were able to apply the silicone adhesive without it touching any grout. I&#x27;d be less comfortable with the product if I didn&#x27;t have that much non-porous surface for it. I love that it doesn&#x27;t have to stick to the glass door (where it would be more visible) and that it doesn&#x27;t fall down. And even though the bracket is mounted up high for my 6&#x27;6&amp;#34; husband, I can always angle it or take down the actual mirror if I want it for my shorter self.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a solution to save time when shaving, because I&#x27;m a guy whose facial hair grows incredibly fast, and I would get in trouble at work for not being clean shaven quite frequently. I would try my best, but I would often run out of time or have terrible lighting conditions in my bathroom. Soon enough, I got fed up with the trouble and decided to invest some money in some kind of bathroom mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, I found this shaving mirror on Amazon for a great price and I am very impressed with the quality and the very clever, smart design for the mirror. This mirror was designed for the man who expects perfection in maintaining his appearance. The only drawback is that I wish I would have put in a better position in my shower. Overall a great product, and anybody who needs to shave and doesn&#x27;t get one is a damned idiot and/or a slacker. (Or somebody who wants to grow out a beard.)</li>
    <li> I have used several different brands of shower mirrors over the years and none of them has worked nearly as good as this product.  I have only used this for a few weeks, but have been very satisfied up to now.  I will update if anything changes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this mirror for over a year now and it is still working perfectly. The mirror image is clear and undistorted. Install it according to the directions and it should stay up without a problem.  Just remember to empty it after your shower or else you will be dumping cold water on your feet the next day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  This mirror is now over two years old and still functions as well as the day I installed it.</li>
    <li> WHat else can I say about this mirror , it&#x27;s just perfect . I bought this item FOUR times as presents for my Hubby, brother, father in law and my son school bus driver for christmas. Everyone LOVES it ! no complaints by far the best fogless shower mirror and once my hubby approves I know it is good! he has three different brands and they all suck. He loves this one. GREAT BUY ! TOP RATED!</li>
    <li> Initially, I had not realized I needed to refill the water each time I showered behind the mirror, so it hadn&#x27;t been working, but after receiving an email from the CEO, I stand corrected. No issues since... Thank you for correcting my error in use and I really appreciate the customer service shown by this organization to ensure that all users are happy with their product.</li>
    <li> This fogless mirror actually works as advertized. After shaving at the sink for a half-century, finally got a good shave. I was sketical, but this really works. Does not fog up. Steam in shower makes your beard soft. Saves lots of time. Great results. Still looking for a good shaving soap, but razor blades last much longer when shaving in the shower. Fast delivery from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my fair share of cheap mirrors that claim to be fog free. I finally got tired of splashing water and using any product I could find to smear over my mirror to actually be able to see into it while shaving in the shower. This product has a lot of good reviews and for good reason. I was hesitant of the price at first, but am now VERY satisfied with this purchase. The clarity of this mirror is amazing and it&#x27;s very easy to fill with warm water and get a fog-free mirror for the duration of my shower. The only improvement I can see is if the squeegee was a few millimeters longer to fit the exact size of the mirror. Overall, a great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving in the shower for at least 20 years. The mirror I had finally died (car antenna type arm). So, I shopped on Amazon and liked the number of good reviews here. I&#x27;ve had this mirror now for a couple weeks. I love it! It&#x27;s so clear and big! I can actually see myself now. Not necessarily a good thing, but I can! I wish I had found this years ago. Although it may be a little fragile, I can&#x27;t say since it&#x27;s new for me. I suspect, if used carefully and properly it&#x27;ll last for many years. I can watch myself get older, also not necessarily a good thing. Highly recommended, since you&#x27;ll see you and not me!</li>
    <li> Works just as advertised: great product! One recommendation: mount it as far away from the showerhead as possible. It&#x27;s a bit annoying to have to squeegee the mirror so frequently.</li>
    <li> By far the best shower shaving mirror Ive ever had.  Easy to install &amp; doesnt randomly fall off the wall like the suction cup ones.  Clear mirror, unlike the others that get foggy and are distorted.</li>
    <li> I received the Fogless mirror very promply from ToiletTree and it is exactly what they said it was--- a thoughtful design, easy to hang, and  a clear fogless mirror . I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried shaving mirrors with a \\&quot;fogless coating\\&quot; from various mall stores for years and they always stay fogless for a few days at best.  I had read that the only way for a shaving mirror to actually be fogless is if it stays warm, which means connecting it to the shower head so that some hot water is drawn through it.  But I need a mirror at the other side of the shower -- how can you shave if your face is under running water?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a simple, brilliant solution that works perfectly: take a regular mirror that can be mounted anywhere and put a small reservoir right behind the glass so you can just fill it with warm water at the start of the shower.  The mirror stays clear through the whole shower, and looks much better than the plastic models from stores which cost twice as much!  Best of all, it stays firmly attached to the shower with an adhesive gel rather than a gimmicky suction cup that will work for the first week or two.</li>
    <li> This product is worth it!    Had tried a $15 fogless shower mirror from Target that did manage to not fog up . . . For a few days.  A few months later of having a worthless mirror in the shower I decided to order this one thanks to all the positive reviews.  The old one was pitched in the recycle bin (I hope it was recyclable . . .)    Anyway there was a little more involved in the setup of this mirror than the other mirror for sure.  That mirror used suction cups (which never let go I will say) while this mirror uses silicone adhesive and double sided sticky tape (sets of both are included)    I cleaned the area with Clorox wipes, let that dry, put the sticky tape and silicone gel on the mounting bracket (have about half the silicone gel tube left over after applying what appears to be the recommended amount) and let sit for 24 hours.   No issues with this holding the mirror up at all.  Very solid. That said make sure you like where you&#x27;re going to put it and that you mount it straight.  This is not something you move easily.      This fogless shower mirror is something you forget about at that point however.  In order for this mirror to not fog you MUST fill it with hot water.  I guess this equilizes the temperature to prevent fog?  Not sure the science of it.  Anyway, this works best if you have a nozzle that concentrates the water otherwise you might want to take it to the bathroom sink to fill.    It works perfectly but I&#x27;m not without a gripe . . .   The water is just sitting open in the mirror and I found it&#x27;s easy to forget to dump it at the end of the shower.  This isn&#x27;t a huge concern but still water is where certain kinds of insects like to reproduce.  May be an unfounded fear but it&#x27;s on my mind so I do my best to empty it when done.  I&#x27;d suggest a lid but that would be a point of potential failiure (either an extra piece to lose or a mechanical lid that can break) which I think Toiletree is trying to avoid.    Aside from that I do feel this product is worth five stars and worth your money.  It&#x27;s a simple design that just works.  It&#x27;s not relying on any special coatings that would wear out over time (at least not that I&#x27;m aware of) so this should be something you buy once not multiple times over which seems to be the case with competing products.  One replacement for the $15 mirror I had before would mean my total outlay exceeded the cost of this product not to mention the waste produced by a worthless product.      Don&#x27;t waste time and money, go with something that just works.  This product is it.</li>
    <li> I admit when I saw that this shower mirror says \\&quot;Designed to be fogless for a lifetime,\\&quot; I was skeptical.  I have purchased my husband numerous so-called \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; frames and they all fog up!  I also have had the problem in the past with the mirrors falling off because they didn&#x27;t stick to the tile good enough.  The ToiletTree Fogless mirror uses silicone which is like a glue substance that you stick on your tile and then you attach the mirror, and it is holding it.  I have had it up now for a week and it is not going anywhere!  I also don&#x27;t think I will have a problem removing the mirror if I want to as the silicone seems pretty flexible and is clear so it won&#x27;t leave a residue.  To use the mirror all you have to do is lift it off, fill it with hot water and snap it back on.  The hot water is the trick as that is what keeps it from fogging up!  Then if you do get spots on it or didn&#x27;t fill it with hot water, just use the attached squeegee to wipe it clean.  The shelf that is included also holds at least 2 razors so it is a nice size shelf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is definitely the best Fogless Mirror I have seen so far and I really do recommend it.  So far it is working great for us and with features like an adjustable frame, shatter proof, rust proof, easily attaches to tile, and a shelf, the mirror just keeps getting better!</li>
    <li> We placed our fogless mirror in our log cabin that we rent out. We thoroughly enjoy it for our own use but were pleasantly surprised when one of the folks who used the cabin mentioned how he liked the mirror. It far exceeded our expectations. It truly is fogless, stays firmly on the wall, and adjusts easily to everyone&#x27;s height. It gives a nice clean, upgraded look to our shower. Thanks, it&#x27;s just what you advertised.    Peter and Bernadette</li>
    <li> Awful Fogs up every time I use it. I hate this mirror. Bad, Do not buy this peace of junk</li>
    <li> My order for the Fogless Shower Mirror came quickly from ToiletTree Product. It was also packaged well. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and highly recommend this merchant.</li>
    <li> I have had several shower mirrors.  They all had suction cups and were supposedly fogless and they never stayed up on the shower wall and far from fogless.  This mirror is an exception. They provide silicone sealant and it has been up and used for a few weeks and very sturdy.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this item, you do have to put some hot water in a slot behind the mirror each time.  That is what prevents the fog.  The mirror slips off easily to put the water in and slides back in place just as easy.  You do also need to use a squeegee (included) to prevent water spots.  The only suggestion I would make is to have some magnification in the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller is 5 stars. Very fast shipping.  Overall 5 star item.</li>
    <li> I have tried a bunch of fogless shower mirrors.  This is the only one yet to live up to its claims.  Great product and at a great price!</li>
    <li> The mirror is ingeniously fogless.  Despite not being glass (which would be a hazard in the shower), the image is crystal clear.  It takes only a minute or two to install.  A bit higher priced than other such mirrors shown on Amazon, but those have spotty reviews, at best.</li>
    <li> Pro :   works perfectly    Con:  every time you use it,you have to fill it with hot water &amp; then dump it out for the next use.You have to remove it from the wall bracket to do this.Takes just a few seconds now that I&#x27;ve got the hang of it.</li>
    <li> I bought this shower mirror as a Christmas gift. We mounted it following the directions and it was usable the next day. The mirror is very clear and not distorted and it stays fog-free. We do not bother to remove the mirror to refill the reservoir, we simply take a large cup of hot water and overflow the reservoir as suggested by another reviewer. I really can&#x27;t imagine any improvements to the design being necessary; it works as advertised.</li>
    <li> Got the mirror for Christmas.  Me, being lazy, I got tired of emptying the mirror after my shower.  I ended up drilling a really small hole in the bottom of the mirror to let it drain by itself, now it&#x27;s fill and forget!  The mirror stays fog free long enough for me to shave.  Now it&#x27;s perfect.     Installation was a snap!</li>
    <li> Most &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; mirrors don&#x27;t work, in my experience. This one easily mounts to a tile wall and works as advertised. You fill the small chamber behind the mirror with water from the shower -- takes all of five seconds -- and the mirror remains clear because it&#x27;s at the same temperature (or higher) than the air in the shower. Simple physics. Simple product.</li>
    <li> If you stumble upon this page looking for a shower mirror you&#x27;ve come to right place.  I haven&#x27;t tried other brands but I have a feeling I won&#x27;t need to.  Works great.</li>
    <li> This mirror works well....and stays fogless so far.  The only thing my husband wished it had was light.  Definitely works better than another brand we bought.  Mirror stays fogless by filling a small compartment on the back of the mirror with water from the shower.  Very easy to do.  Definitely worth getting.</li>
    <li> I have tried numerous fog less mirrors without any luck.  This one actually does what it says.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This mirror works as advertised!  I&#x27;ve used it for a few days so far, and it works like a champ.  No fog.  Tilts easily to get the correct angle.  The temperature is kept consistent with the water chamber sitting behind the mirror.  I&#x27;ve had a few other mirrors which were much more expensive, and this one is far superior.</li>
    <li> I got this product under the impression that the mirror was fog less but it is not. It does not make sense to advertise a product to serve a certain function when it does not even come close to serving said function. The name of this product should be non fog less mirror with squgy to wipe fog away.. Terrible. Lying to consumers will not last forever.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my brother as a present for Christmas and he loved it. Very easy to install. He loves it!</li>
    <li> I expected a piece of junk, but was surprised at how well this item works.  I bought it to use until I could replace my $300 fogless system, but now I think I&#x27;ll just keept this.  Yes it is not glass and you need to put warm water in it each time, but neither is an issure.  It works well.</li>
    <li> I have been using this mirror for the last 3 weeks and I&#x27;m very satisfied with it. I haven&#x27;t mounted it on the wall because I don&#x27;t like to create clutter in the shower so I cannot comment on the wall mounted bracket. I fill the mirror every time I use it and hold it in my hand while shaving. It works perfectly. It is easy to clean and isn&#x27;t very heavy even when filled with water.    It is very satisfying to find a product that does what it promises to with no compromises.</li>
    <li> Within 1 minute of running hot water in my shower, this mirror was completely fogged.  They give you a squeege with it but after wiping it approx. every 10 seconds I finally gave up and used the fogless spray I was using with my prior mirror, which is the reason I got rid of it in the first place.  Very disappointed.  I&#x27;m beginning to think there is no such thing as a fogless mirror.  This is the third different brand I have tried.</li>
    <li> Works as promised.  Easy to install, keep clean,and fogless.Holds very well against the tile with the silicone adhesive.A version with a larger mirror would also be nice!</li>
    <li> Since I like to shave when my face is wet and softened this product is made for doing such as this.</li>
    <li> This mirror is so cleaver. Add a little water in the back and it stays crystal clear.  My husband loves it,  me too....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried every shower mirror out there finally found one that works!  I was a bit skeptical about having to fill a reservoir with hot water each time but it&#x27;s no big deal and a reasonable tradeoff to make the system work.  Finally, a shower shaving mirror that actually remains fog free and will continue to do so.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my husband for Christmas.  We were very excited about this mirror, but the silicone was hardenend up and we couldn&#x27;t use it adhere the mirror to the shower wall.  We notified customer service and they sent us a new silicone tube along with a gift for our trouble.  The mirror works great.</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror.  Truly fogless and stays on the wall!  It is just the way it was described and is just what my husband was looking for.</li>
    <li> I have scanned many of the other reviews and there isn&#x27;t much I can say that hasn&#x27;t already been said; but I can simply add my voice to those others by saying that it works great and I love it.  If you take the time to properly prep the mounting surface per instructions, you should never have to worry about the mirror falling (as had happened to me many times with other mirrors).  As an engineer, I appreciate the simple science behind the mirror, which is that fog is caused by a temperature gradient (hot steam clashing with a cool mirror).  With warm to hot water in the trough behind the mirror, the temperature gradient is reduced and it is impossible to fog up.  I can&#x27;t express enough how wonderful it has been to be able to properly see my face again while shaving.  The mirror piece slides in and out of the holder very easily and feels very sturdy in place.  Even if you are lazy and don&#x27;t fill it with water before you get in the shower, just pull it out and stick under the shower head for a few seconds (to fill the reservior) and you&#x27;ll be all set.  I especially love the shelf for my razor and the built-in squeegee is a nice touch too.    There just is no reason to buy any other type of \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; mirror, because no other mirror can really do it as perfectly as this one does.</li>
    <li> The no fog action actually works with the warm water in the canister. Easy installation, very littel cleanup if any, very satisfied, would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> It is IMPORTANT to note that this works differently than most fogless mirrors. You fill this with hot water while showering (which is easy) and the mutual temps eliminate fog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two tips that make a huge difference:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Keep a cup in the shower to fill this with.&lt;br /&gt;2. Drill a tiny hole in the bottom of this - it will &amp;#34;auto-empty&amp;#34; the water after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over 2 years of used and still works great.</li>
    <li> Best shaving mirror in recorded history.  Nothing compares.  Be a hero, and not a zero.  Buy this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many mirrors, this one is by far the very best.</li>
    <li> Fine if you want to replace it yearly.  First, it&#x27;s somewhat distorted right out of the box as it is not glass. Second, over several months it discolors rendering it less and less useful.</li>
    <li> Great mirror, the best I have used. However, strangely enough my mirror does fog up(easily cleaned though) and did fall(adhesive failed eventually). Still, a good product and well designed.</li>
    <li> Operated exactly as advertised for the last week since I bought it.  Look forward to many long years with this working as ever other month my other mirrors would fail and fog over!</li>
    <li> Very happy.  Attached it to my shower tile with the silicone adhesive and double stick pads with no problems.  Works great.  Recommend it.  A+++</li>
    <li> This mirror works exactly as described. Installation instructions were easy to understand. Filling the product with hot water only takes a few seconds. The squeegee works well when water is splashed on the mirror. Shaving with the mirror is fantastic! Using a double edged razor, it&#x27;s the best shave I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few fogless mirrors but of course none of them are really fogless.  This is the one I&#x27;ve had that really does what they claim.  Easy to mount, nice size, easy to fill with water and empty.  If you need a fogless mirror, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried others, but this is by far the best shower mirror I&#x27;ve come across.  Being a bit near-sighted I&#x27;ve got to stand close so I can see what I&#x27;m doing. It&#x27;s easy to fill and place back on the holder, and the warm water keeps it fog free longer than I&#x27;m in the shower.  The reflective surface is great, and the rubber squeegee works well enough to clean the mirror when needed.  Your going to get a few drops of water on it, but hey... your in a shower!!!  This is one of those times that I truly believe a product is worthy of 5 full stars.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome shower mirror with a unique idea to keep it from fogging up. I have been very happy with this item.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as advertised.  Securely mounts, but will come off cleanly once I decide to move out.  This is a very nice product.  I recommend buying it.</li>
    <li> Broke within the year</li>
    <li> This mirror truly is fogless. It works great and stays fog free the entire time I&#x27;m in the shower. It&#x27;s relatively easy to assemble, although you do have to silicone it to the wall, which would make it hard if you are moving anytime soon. I&#x27;ll probably just buy a new one when I move. I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this product. I&#x27;ve been looking for a fogless mirror for a long time and nothing else compares with this one.</li>
    <li> Well it installed easily, has stayed up and stays fog free. If it falls down or stops reflecting, I&#x27;ll come back and edit this review to reflect that.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Installation on a dry, clean shower wall (tile in my case) was a snap, gave it 48 hours to set up and it is solid as a rock. Filling the mirror with shower water is easy, dump it afterwards and you will have no problems with mildew or scum build up. I squeegee each time to prevent water spotting, takes a second to do. Viewing mirror has ample space to see your face. No complaints here.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it says it does. At last, a fog-free mirror in the shower. The water reservoir keeps it warm and the built-in squeegee addresses any splashing. Perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I should have sprung for the bigger version with a light.....</li>
    <li> It works fine. Nothing will stick to my shower wall.  Would be helpful to arrange mirror so that it could be hung from the device that hangs over the shower you can use to put your soap hand towels.  Many of us already have one of these and it would simple to hang this mirror if it had a way to hook it over one of the rings. I am using my fogless by hanging it over one of these shower tools now.</li>
    <li> Finally found a fogless mirror that works as advertised. You do have to fill up a reservoir with hot water before each use but that only takes a second. The mirror easily detaches from the mount when filling the reservoir. Also has a pretty cool tilt feature if you decide to grow a few inches. This thing is also super easy to mount on tile. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> I have bought 3 of these over the [ast few years. It truley never falls. My first one i used for a few years before the mirror wouldnt stay up anymore. Then I bought another. The one I bought this time was only because I moved. The only thing is this timme I bought it because it was a great sale! But when i recieved it the mirror was smaller in size. They didnt advertise the smaller mirrir with the sale which is kind of sneaky. But it does the trick. It wont fall off the shower wall.</li>
    <li> Very strong and well made. It really does work. It&#x27;s simple to add water to the back and empty when done.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this thing and uses it every single day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have had other models of this kind of thing, but they never worked out.</li>
    <li> works very well . I did not install it on the wall , I have corner shelves in the tub/shower and the lip for the hanger fits on the shelf edge.</li>
    <li> Shipped in a timely manner and it works as advertised. Just put warm water in the reservoir and the mirror wont fog.</li>
    <li> I actually had doubts about this mirror. Didn&#x27;t know how long it&#x27;s going to last or how secure it will be on a wet wall. I have to say after 3 months of daily showers (twice sometimes) I&#x27;m really impressed! You have k follow the instructions to a tee though if you wanna see what you&#x27;re hoping to see.</li>
    <li> Gift for my husband who cant stop raving about it</li>
    <li> Mirror is great. You have to fill it up with water prior to use so watch out for that when you hang it up since you are not able to move it.</li>
    <li> Perfect product with fast Shipping</li>
    <li> Easy to install, does not fog like my old one. If you are a shower shaver like myself, I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> this is the second one of these mirrors i have purchased it works great first one i have ever seen that works</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several shower mirrors for my husband and none of them worked well.  This one, however, works like a charm.  You slide it off the base and fill the back with hot water and slide it back on, then you&#x27;re set to shave.  How much easier can it get?  The beauty of it is, it just doesn&#x27;t fog.  They sent plenty of adhesive with it and I installed it per instructions, not using the shower for a day afterwards.  It&#x27;s held great, and I expect it to continue to.  My husband loves shaving in the shower, and it&#x27;s supposed to be the best environment ever for a close shave.  He&#x27;s very happy with it!  If you you&#x27;re looking for a reasonably priced shower mirror that doesn&#x27;t fog, you&#x27;re done!  Congratulations.</li>
    <li> UPDATE: my product is a couple of years old, and they claim to have addressed my complaint.  Immediately I posted my review, the manufacturer contacted me about it and is sending me the newer (redesigned) part at no charge.  For now I&#x27;m updating the review from 1 to 5 stars for stellar customer service.  I&#x27;ll find out soon how good their fix is, but at the very least they take good care of their customers... another update will follow...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice mirror, at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror pivots to allow for your height.  The angle is controlled by three teeth that sits in three of a line of notches.  You push it to adjust, and then it is supposed to hold that position.  That works well when the mechanism is new, but over time (six months or so), the teeth and notches, being made of soft plastic for some reason, wear down and round off.  And then the mirror won&#x27;t stay where you put it, but just drops to the lowest setting.</li>
    <li> So I looked for years for a fog free mirror and went thru at least 4-5 others.  They would work for a few months and then the anti-fog would wear down and I would be back to just a junky mirror in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not this thing.  Been using it to shave in the shower for over a year and its great.  So simple and brilliant.  First item I have ever reviewed on amazon because it was that good!  A++&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wish I had patented the idea before these guys got it :)</li>
    <li> This mirror gets 5 stars.  It is perfect.  I have been searching 10 years for a mirror that didn&#x27;t have horrible useless suction cups and had a heat source to prevent fogging.  This works perfect and is secure to the wall.  I would recommend over and over.  Thanks for the brains that came up with this</li>
    <li> This fogless mirror works exactly as promised and it really is easy to use. The silicone gel and the tape on the back secure it to your shower wall without the risk of it falling. Having said that, I don&#x27;t believe it is worth the price that Amazon is selling it for. A couple pieces of plastic is not worth $30. Perhaps $20 but definitely not $30.</li>
    <li> Just had to submit a review after I heard my husband&#x27;s comment yesterday.  He told my son(who purchased the mirror for him) that his was the best gift he received last Christmas.  He said he uses it everyday, it works perfectly and that he wants to get one for all the guys in the family! Coming from him that is high praise indeed.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for my boyfriend and he really loves it! Its so convenient having a mirror in the shower that is so easy to use.</li>
    <li> This is the product that I had been looking for. It does not fog at all, provides an adjustable reflective surface, and stays connected to the wall without slipping or falling down. I was a little hesitant to use the silicon glue to secure the mirror, but after testing a small bit on a not-so-noticeable part of the shower tile and then removing it, I found that it left no stains or residue. My only real concern with this product is the included squeegee. The soft plastic blade is a little too soft in my opinion. When I try to squeegee the mirror surface, if I hold the squeegee at the ends, then middle section doesn&#x27;t have enough pressure and will not make a great connection. If I hold it in the middle, the sides don&#x27;t get wiped correctly. It is only a minor concern though. Usually just rinsing the mirror will remove enough of the water droplets to let me see.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it claims to be a \\&quot;Fogless Shower Mirror\\&quot;. Just follow the clear and simple instructions and you will be very pleased with the results. The fact that it is adjustable makes it even better. So far the whole family is giving it the thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I took a risk buying this item because thee were so many out there and I didn&#x27;t know what would be the best for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product a lot because it&#x27;s convenient, stable, and efficient. The customer service behind this product superb as well as the distributor contact me to give me tips on premium installation and techniques to keep the item going for  along shelf life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does what&#x27;s it&#x27;s supposed to and more. I definately would recommend this item to someone thinking about getting a better shave and saving time/mess in the morning.</li>
    <li> I have had a lot of shower mirrors but this is the best one I have ever used. Easy to install and most importantly no fog! Ingenious and simple all in one.</li>
    <li> I got frustrated with the offerings I found in stores and then happended upon this mirror on Amazon.  5* rating from over 400 people easily convinced me to try it and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  It works and it&#x27;s a very nice looking product too!  Nothing negative to report here...  I&#x27;m one happy customer!</li>
    <li> Every once in awhile, you stumble across a product that actually does what it is supposed to do.  Here is one of those products.  Simply fill the back of the mirror with water from the shower head, and you are good to go.  I even have the bad habit of leaving this in the shower, and sometimes it needs cleaning to get the sop residue off, but even then, no problem.    I did not, however, use their method to hand the mirror.  My wife was too nervous about applying all of that to the expensive tile.  So, I improvided with some simply suction cups, adjusted it to the right height, and I was in business.    Yes, I would reccomend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> This is indeed an amazing mirror, but for those with contacts like me who don&#x27;t wear them in the shower, this may not be worth the money.  I&#x27;m thinking of not using it because the mirror over the sink with my contacts in is actually much easier.  That said, I imagine this would be the case with any shower mirror.  Silly me, I simply did not think about this when I bought it, so be aware.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband last Christmas and he loves it.  Ten months later it continues to remain fogless in the shower by simply refilling with hot water and is still attached to shower wall since original application.  The built in squeegee comes in handy.  I would buy again and recommend to anyone in search of a fogless shower mirror.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best shower mirror I&#x27;ve ever purchased. This thing is a nice sized mirror and this thing will never rust. You do have to do put hot water in the opening of the mirror or it will fog. That&#x27;s really not a big deal though.</li>
    <li> This mirror is great in that it really doesn&#x27;t fog! However it grew mold under the mirror &amp;#34;film&amp;#34; so that when you look into the mirror you see black specks all over.</li>
    <li> I decided to give this a try because of all of the great reviews.  I&#x27;ve now had it a little over 3 months and the friction lock that allows you to angle the mirror has stopped working.  They are just some small plastic teeth that are supposed to hold up a mirror filled with water.  My mirror will now stay in only two positions, angled downward or all the way up.  So much for having a usable shaving mirror.  I definitely don&#x27;t think this was worth the price.  What a shame, I really liked it when I first got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 9/15/13:  The day I posted this review, I received an email from the owner of the company apologizing for the problem and offering to send out a replacement part to fix it.  Somehow I missed his email and never saw it.  Two years later someone made a comment about this review and when I read that comment I saw Steve&#x27;s original email.  It was 2 years later so I wasn&#x27;t sure what would happen but I decided to email him back.  He was very courteous in his reply and reiterated his offer to send me a replacement part.  I just received it and installed it and am excited to see how it holds up.  I bumped my review up from a 1-star to a 3-star based on the customer service alone (by far the best I&#x27;ve seen on Amazon).  I&#x27;m going to test how the replacement holds up and if it keeps working longer then I&#x27;ll be back bumping this review up even higher.  At the very least, buying something from ToiletTree means you&#x27;ll receive prompt replies to your concerns and a genuine desire to make sure you are happy with your purchase.</li>
    <li> I finally got rid of the little mirror I had picked up in a physical store that didn&#x27;t work AT ALL yet I still tried to use it anyway.  This mirror is perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that I&#x27;ll frequently end up spilling cold water on myself when I go to empty it, but that&#x27;s not the fault of the mirror.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery and an all around good product.  The included directions for mounting the mirror were clear and well written.  It has been a few weeks and the mirror is still on the wall and not in the tub so I guess I put it up correctly!  The mirror doesn&#x27;t fog and really is great for shaving.  I gave it four stars because filling the small tank with water every morning is sort of a weird thing to do while standing in the shower.</li>
    <li> This is the second fogless mirror I&#x27;ve ordered because it works superlatively. Simply elegant, easy to install. This is the real deal, we&#x27;ve bought several others over the years and all of them failed to deliver.</li>
    <li> This is a great mirrow. My husband shaves in the shower and has had many shower mirrors. This mirrow does not fog if you do what they say. Either remove from holder or, if you have a hand held shower head just put warm water in the holder on the back. The mirror will not fog! It stays clear and the image is clear! Love it!</li>
    <li> This is my first review ever on Amazon and I have been shopping here forever.  This product is amazing.  Very easy to install, just make sure you have it at the right level since you will be gluing it to the shower wall.  Once you are ready to shave you fill the mirror with water, use the handy dandy little squeegee and bingo you are good to go.  No fogging, mirror is clear as a bell.  I had an old \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; mirror and I could barely make out my face when shaving.</li>
    <li> Well what more can I say, other than it does what it says it will do - absolutely fabulous product - love it.</li>
    <li> This lives up to its billing. Its the first shower mirror I&#x27;ve had that never has a problem. Its always good all the time and the squeegee that comes with it is a great help. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Perfect in every way. Easy mounting and works great.</li>
    <li> Product works as advertised. The mirror is very clear . The plastic frame and mounting bracket are light but strong . Filing the reservoir with warm water immediately clears the mirror even if it has already fogged . It stays clear for at least 5 minutes so just fill it when you&#x27;re ready to shave and it&#x27;s perfect. Very happy with this product</li>
    <li> You got me. There&#x27;s no long term guarantee but I fell prey to marketing that made it seem so. The mirror, like all other &amp;#34;fog less&amp;#34; mirrors will likely fail after 4-6 months and I&#x27;ll be stuck with it.</li>
    <li> i have tried fogless mirrors for years.  this one actually works.  it is easy and it has a very good mirror.  i recommend it very highly.</li>
    <li> works well. Functional and a real mirror. Do not apply it to glass as it is a eyesore on the other side.</li>
    <li> finally figured out how to shave in the shower.  It seems like a no-brainer, but I&#x27;ve never found another mirror that works as well.</li>
    <li> I wish I had found this mirror sooner -- it is awesome.  First, it&#x27;s got a nice, clear mirror.  Second, it&#x27;s a good size for a shower mirror.  Third, and most importantly, this thing does not fog up.  Period.  The slight downside, and I mean *slight*, is that you do have to use the silicon adhesive to make it semi-permanent.  However, it *can* be removed if needed.  My old mirror used suction cups and every few months, almost like clockwork, it would come crashing down in the middle of the night when the suction cups gave out.  This thing isn&#x27;t going anywhere unless I want it to.  I am thrilled with this product.  There&#x27;s a good reason why it&#x27;s the highest-rated fogless shower mirror.</li>
    <li> I have not used this mirror yet, but it uses the same technology as another mirror I own which works perfectly.  Filling the water basin behind the mirrior is really no trouble at all and should not be a deterrant to this product.  You simply fill it when the water is running hot and empty it when you are done with your shower.  The reason I have not given it more stars is becuase I have not used it.  Why am I writing a review when I have not used it, it is why I have not used it.  When you affix this mirror to your shower, it is a permanent placement.  There are two sticky pads to apply to the shower and a silicon gel compound you apply the back of the mirror to afix it to the shower.  Instructtions make it clear the mirror will not stay up unless you use all the gel compound.  I did not want a mirror I could not move once it was up so I decided to return as soon as I opened it.  The other mirror I use attaches to the wall by suction cup.  Making it easy to take with you to another shower either in travel or in the house.</li>
    <li> Great product - a little annoying to dump the water every time you use it.. Otherwise works great and recommend</li>
    <li> Best shower mirror my husband ever had...... It is easy to install and remains fog free.  +++++++++  A definite recommend !!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Yes, it really does what it says on the tin..  Since I &#x27;converted&#x27; to shaving in my shower, I&#x27;ve tried a couple of mirrors, with middling success. This product has remained fog free irrespective of the steam in the shower. Easy to install, seems well made, will report after a few months use. Fingers crossed.</li>
    <li> So far this has worked superior to my old Sharper Image shower mirror that cost over $100!! I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product</li>
    <li> Bought a fog less shower mirror and this one fogs up ??</li>
    <li> I like to shave in the shower, this makes it great. I mounted it to the wall, the mirror just slides up and off holder, I fill it with hot water and put it back. The mirror stays clear and the squeegee works great to keep the water off the mirror.</li>
    <li> Came because of the reviews and I was not disappointed. Moved apartments recently so I didn&#x27;t have one for a couple weeks and life was hell, just bought another one and can&#x27;t wait for it to show up.</li>
    <li> The mirror works as advertised.  I have not needed to fill it with shower water to keep it fog free.  Mounts easily, tilt adjustment for fine tuning. Who could ask for more?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; shower mirrors for years for shaving, but have always been disappointed with the products on the market. I had just gotten used to constantly wiping down the mirror and working around the inescapable fog and water droplets, I guess. This product, however, delivers as promised: completely fog-free, water drop-free, clear as a bell as long as you fill the reservoir in back with hot water (which is easy). One of the best buys I&#x27;ve made in recent memory and definitely recommended to others. Wonderful!</li>
    <li> Every word written about this fogless shower mirror is correct.  Easy to mount and a delight to use.  The squeege provided is handy and works well.  You can also use the squeege for the shower.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I have the best shower shaves with this thing.  Filling and putting back on the mount is super easy and the squeegee right before the shave is awesome.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband.  He said it was easy to install and has already used it.  He loves it and says it is of outstanding quality.  Even has a little squeegee that comes with it.</li>
    <li> The mirror does not fog up when it is filled with hot water and has never fallen after I stuck it in the shower.</li>
    <li> Nothing but problems. Had to return 1st one same problem. Charge cord doesn&#x27;t fit well, doesn&#x27;t stay charged &amp; now completely black. Can&#x27;t reboot as advised. Waste of time &amp; money. Won&#x27;t turn on no matter what j try. Holding power down same time as Volume + etc.&lt;br /&gt;so discouraged as I bought 2, one ad s gift. Both no good.</li>
    <li> I have used many different \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; mirrors through the years but this is the first that has truly lived up to its name.  The reservoir behind the mirror warms the mirror and makes all the difference.  Worth every penny spent!</li>
    <li> This is the third mirror that I have tried.I have finally found one that works as advertised. Will be buying more as christmas gifts. Great product, very happy.[[ASIN:B003BQ6QXK Fogless Shower Mirror with Squeegee by ToiletTree Products. Guaranteed Not to Fog, Designed Not to Fall.]]</li>
    <li> This was a great purchase.  It really is fogless.  Just be sure to follow the instructions exactly as directed.  We&#x27;ve been using this for 4 months now and have no problems with it.</li>
    <li> I use it everyday to admire my face and it&#x27;s many features. Fog doth not impede my view! Huzzah ToiletTree!</li>
    <li> Unlike other systems I&#x27;ve used, where water continuously flows behind the mirror, this one requires you to fill a bin each time you use it.  Looks good and works fine, but that extra step is extra. Also, I often forget to empty the bin, which isn&#x27;t a problem, as far as I can see.</li>
    <li> I had purchased  2 fogless mirrors last 4 months but really this product is grate,,,easy to fix more clear glue provided with the mirror and a nice quality frame and shelf plus fog cleaner is attachd with the mirror..  The seller is highly commited with fast shipping and nice packing..  Thank you</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror so that I could shave my beard and scalp while showering. I&#x27;ve been shaving my head for about five years. All of the other mirrors I&#x27;ve bought tend to become hazy and/or unusable over time despite frequent cleaning. I&#x27;ve had this mirror from ToiletTree for about two weeks now and it is as advertised. If you put the hot water in the holding area behind the mirror, then the mirror stays sharp and pristine for the duration of your shower. The squeegee that comes with the mirror works great. The process to mount it on a shower wall with silicone gel is super easy. I love this product.</li>
    <li> This mirror is designed to be fog proof and shatter proof. With this, I was able to clean myself off properly and not give my SO a heart attack when I got out of the shower. :) So, its quite useful. I also like how there&#x27;s a little shelf space for you to rest your razor or whatever. The only problem is I&#x27;m lazy and I have to remember to fill the reservoir every time with warm/hot water or it won&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I bought a couple of \\&quot;anti-fog\\&quot; shower mirrors in past and they never seem to work. I just got this one in and it works perfect so far.  I think the difference is that you fill up the mirror with warm water before you use it and this is what keeps the mirror fogging up</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about a fogless mirror, but was very tired of having to clean up a huge mess everytime my husband shaved his beard over the sink. The Toilet Tree Fogless Shower Mirror is the perfect solution! It was easy to install in our shower, you fill the mirror with hot water and it doesn&#x27;t fog! It&#x27;s also great for women to pluck there eyebrows. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> The only thing correctly advertised about this product is that it is a mirror. I have been using this mirror for a little over a week. It constantly fogs up in the shower. I have to wipe it off several times during a shave to see. The adhesive tape that comes with it failed within the first few days. i should have tossed it in the trash then. But I figured since I spent almost $40 on this mirror I just deal with it. Overall i don&#x27;t think this is a good product.</li>
    <li> My Husband loves this mirror.  I&#x27;ve bought him 2 different mirrors that didn&#x27;t end up staying fogless or having a clear view.  I was looking online for a great mirror and this one kept coming up #1 fogless mirror.  I thought yea, sure it is.  Well I decided to go ahead and get it and I&#x27;m shocked but my husband LOVES it.  He says it is the best mirror I have gotten him.  I&#x27;m so happy I don&#x27;t have to ever shop around for another shower mirror again.</li>
    <li> Works great so far.  Kind of tedious to fill with water daily, wish there was a tube or something that could connect to the shower directly.  Also, wish they had notches for multiple razors.  My wife has taken the ledge for her razor even though she just shaves her legs!  Also, wick is a little flimsy and hard to hold.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror for my husband and son last year and they love it!  We recently remodeled our bathroom and took the mirror down. I contacted the company for replacement adhesive and they did not hesitate to ship it to me the next day.  Their service is excellent and they couldn&#x27;t have been nicer![[ASIN:B003BQ6QXK Fogless Shower Mirror with Squeegee by ToiletTree Products. Guaranteed Not to Fog, Designed Not to Fall.]]</li>
    <li> This Mirror is the Bombdiggity I like the way it swivels up and down. Works exactly as advertised. Someone should have invented this years ago.  Keith Antioch Ill</li>
    <li> My son-in-law requested this for Christmas.  He&#x27;s very pleased with it, and says it saves him time in getting ready for work.  It also keeps him inspired to keep his goatee trimmed.</li>
    <li> this is my 4 or 5th shower mirror. All of the others failed within a year.  Either the fog-free stopped working, the mirror became difficult to view, the suction cups gave up, or the plastic simply broke.  The fact that this is secured with adhesive makes a big difference.  I&#x27;ve had it for a year and it is going strong.  Visibility is excellent.  I give it a quick wipe with a towel to dry it as I get out of the shower and that keeps the water spots off.  Would buy another if I needed to, but I don&#x27;t.  Believe the good reviews on this mirror.</li>
    <li> I recently bought 2 of these mirror based on all the positive reviews. I have to say I am equally as impressed as the other reviwers. This product is well thought out and well engineered. I am mildly concerned about the weight of the water in the mirror resivoir weakening the mount to the wall, but I will let time be the judge of that. So far both mirrors are holding up very nicely after a month. I would highly recommend this product if you shave in the shower daily.</li>
    <li> Had purchased another mirror from BBB, but quality was poor so returned it. Saw this mirror at Amazon, and bought it after reading the overwhelmingly positive reviews. It&#x27;s simply a great product - easy to install, very sturdy, quality of image from mirror is excellent (glass in more expensive mirror from BBB was not completely flat; it had prism-like lines in glass that distorted mirror image). Got one for my boss for X-Mas - he loves it too. Makes shaving much less of a daily chore.</li>
    <li> I love to shave while in the shower and I&#x27;ve tried several other shower mirrors in the past. This one is the best. Very smart design uses hot water to eliminate fog. Other, &#x27;treated&#x27; mirrors only work for a short time, then need to be constantly wiped off. Also, mounting kit provided is far superior to the usual suction cups provided with other mirrors. This mirror costs a little more, but it is well worth it. Take it from someone who has wasted money on the other types, spend the extra $$ and buy this one.</li>
    <li> Great product, works as well as advertised!  Recommend.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 was the squeegie.  There is no handle to it so it&#x27;s a little akward to use; it requires 2 hands to use it on the mirror.  Other than that very good product.</li>
    <li> This product is so simple and easy and does just what it says it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything is easy, just slide the mirror off to fill it with hot water, slide it on to have it back on the stand, you can also mount it to the wall through hackery if you&#x27;d like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The squeegee works if you want, but I prefer just to wipe it off with my hands and I can see just fine, of course, perfection takes the squeegee but I rarely care about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My ONLY issue is that there is no designated spot for the squeegee, you can put it on the &amp;#34;shelf&amp;#34; but then it takes up the room for your razor or whatever else you use. I generally keep the squeegee put up or in the water compartment of it because I don&#x27;t really need nor want it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although, BEWARE! Be sure to empty out the water after each shower OR stand back when you dump it out next time because that water is no longer hot after a day or two and I personally don&#x27;t like getting frozen, even if before/during a hot shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as quality goes, I&#x27;ve never dropped it so I wouldn&#x27;t know, the plastic feels somewhat cheap but not worthless and I bet it could take a fall or two .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I wish mine didn&#x27;t get stolen, I would [and do] recommend this product to people and I will get another one for sure when I can.</li>
    <li> Had an old crusty plastic mirror that fogged like crazy and wouldn&#x27;t stay put.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is crystal clear and will stay exactly where you put it.  Genius design... Executed perfectly...</li>
    <li> Well thought out, well made, works as stated.</li>
    <li> It was great for a little while  Then the mirrors seal against water failed and the reflective &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; started washing away.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this purchase. Fills with hot water from the shower and does not fog. With included silicone adhesive, the mirror mounted easily on a clean shower wall and shows no sign of coming loose. Mine included the squeegee to clean the shower from spray. Very happy!</li>
    <li> This is the best shower mirror I&#x27;ve found. You just fill up the tank when the shower first gets warm and it stays clear for the entire shower. No messing with plumbing.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband.  I installed it last week.  It works perfectly.  He loves it.</li>
    <li> Awesome shower mirror!! After glueing it on with silicon, I thought to myself &amp;#34;this thing is a damn fixture&amp;#34; it is ridiculously sturdy and will not budge once its on the wall. If you follow the directions and fill it up with warm water each time you use it, it works perfectly and never fogs up.</li>
    <li> This mirror works.  Super easy to fix to the bathroom wall, and plenty of real-estate to see the face while shaving.  It stays fog less while showering which is the best part.  Can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
    <li> It is a little on the inexpensive side.  Getting bumped into results in some pretty serious damage.  Have had it come off the wall but mirror didn&#x27;t break.</li>
    <li> I will have to look deeper into this guarantee because it definitely fogs up!  Why else would they give you the squeegee in the kit?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The back of this mirror also has a open cavity that fills up with water and grows mold/mildew.  This has been a decent mirror until I discovered this cavity on the back.  Now I am shopping for a new mirror again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several shower mirrors that claim to be \\&quot;fogless\\&quot;, and this is the only one that keeps its promise.</li>
    <li> My 3rd one. I have them in all my showers.</li>
    <li> I bought the mirror because I had to replace an older model that used suction cups and kept falling off the shower wall. This new one seems to work well--no fog, nice big mirror. Installation was easy enough. I would recommend it to anyone interested.</li>
    <li> It works. I love it. I will have one in every home I own.</li>
    <li> It works awesome, as described.  No fogging, Its well-designed, solid, and I would purchase it again~</li>
    <li> Love this thing.  Works great.</li>
    <li> I received this for Christmas and really like it.  It is well build and easy to use in the shower.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great product if it stayed on the wall.  Tape and silicone doesn&#x27;t hold it. Would be a great product if they fixed that issue.</li>
    <li> I have gone through several mirrors over the past few years when I started shaving in the shower instead of in the sink. By shaving in the shower, I don&#x27;t need to waste money on shaving cream as I can put my face in the stream of the water and use that as a lubricant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product comes with a large tube of silicone adhesive which you apply to the back of the plastic. You then leave this on the shower wall over night, and then can begin using it the next day. The mirror easily slides in and out of the plastic container so you can fill it up with hot water and eliminate fog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not had a single issue with this product so far. There is no fog on the mirror if you fill it up with hot water. The &amp;#34;wiper blade&amp;#34; works wells and is easily hidden in its own container underneath the mirror. I do not use the base as a place to hold the mirror because I have a shower caddy that holds it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a large quality mirror for the shower that will NOT fog, buy this product.</li>
    <li> I would have given it 5 stars but two items bother me. First the mirror is not a regular mirror and makes the image different and not actual size. It does not necessarily magnify just does not work like a regular mirror. Second is the tilt mechanism is exteremely tight and to change the angle makes you feel like the plastic will break.</li>
    <li> I have used a few different shower mirrors over the years. I was recently searching for a new one at a leading big box retailer, after having given up for the last few years, and thought I would check Amazon while I was at the store. I stumbled on this one and read all of the great reviews. Afterwards, I saw that the store I was in had it for sale as well, but had it hidden below all of the less favorable ones (below the Oxo brand shower-mirror which I had just returned). I also noticed that Amazon had this for $10 less. So I ordered it on Amazon, waited, received it, and I am extremely happy. What an ingenious product.</li>
    <li> This shower mirror was very easy to install, and has worked great for the past few months.  The mirror stays perfectly clear while shaving.</li>
    <li> I needed a fogless mirror and this unit works as advertised. I did drill a hole in the bottom and made a drain. I know I didn&#x27;t need to, but does add to the convenience.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I have been searching a long time for a shower mirror that actually stays fogless after a few uses. This one trully works.  Make sure you read the directions and you will be satisfied.  Only challenge is putting the mirror back in it&#x27;s track after you fill it with water.  Can be tricky, but not a big deal.  This product is highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The other reviews really have it! this is a wonderful in shower shaving mirror. It stays up, and when filled with water, doesn&#x27;t fog up. Just empty it when you are done and away you go.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend as a valentines day gift. We were getting ready to attach it to the shower wall when we realized that the silicone the product came with was dried up and useless. I emailed the company and with 30minutes the director of marketing emailed me back, apologized, and asked for my address! I am very pleased with the customer service I received! She shipped the new silicone tube out the following Monday and it arrived within a few days!</li>
    <li> Does fog a bit, but my hubs is still happy with it.  He shaves with it in the shower.</li>
    <li> This is AWESOME!  We&#x27;ve bought so many bathroom shower mirros and ALL OF THEM FOG.  Finally I found one that didn&#x27;t fog!  You put warm water in the back and that keeps it from fogging up.  I don&#x27;t use it but my husband does and he really enjoys it.  GREAT buy! Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered hundreds of products through Amazon since the beginning of Internet time.  This is my first review and probably my last as there can&#x27;t be a product this good - ever again.  When I tried this product I felt obligated to tell my story.  I&#x27;m completely baffled how anyone gave this product a bad review.  By bad I mean anything below 4.99 stars.  I even read what people had to say.  I still don&#x27;t understand this.  I used to have this little shave mirror.  It was my boy.  It was crooked.  It fogged up.  It was smudged to hell (rain-x + something that&#x27;s not a car windshield &#x3D; BAD).  I was loyal though.  I would look into this little section the size of a quarter and manage to shave.  Then I&#x27;d get out of the shower and have to touch up all the spots I missed cuz I seriously couldn&#x27;t see a thing.  This was no way to live my life.  But I loved him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I came across this product (thanks K).  It was time to break up with my mirror.  I was sad.  I had low expectations.  I can&#x27;t possibly believe all these stellar reviews.  Amazon Prime + 1 click shopping &#x3D; ADHD nightmare.  It arrived on a Wednesday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no way to convey the awesomeness of this mirror.  This is the best I can do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take yourself to 1984.  You just moved from Newark, NJ to Los Angeles.  You&#x27;re in HS and know nobody.  Can you really count the guy who helps you carry your bag inside as a friend?  Did you see his shirt?  It had 2 pigs humping and it said Makin&#x27; Bacon.  He&#x27;s WAY cooler than you.  You&#x27;re scrawny.  You have a crush on a cheerleader who is WAY out of your league.  You get beat up every 5 minutes to the point it&#x27;s almost annoying.  Your name is Daniel LaRusso - my old mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a man who can do anything.  He can put a bike together.  He comes up with the best Halloween costumes EVER.  He can prune trees with a nail clipper.  He has a Medal of Honor.  He&#x27;s a whiz with chop sticks.  He has like 10 cars.  His backyard looks like Home &amp; Garden magazine. He&#x27;s a master fisherman.  He&#x27;s some kind of warm handed voodoo chiropractor. He knows Karate.  His name is Mr. Miyagi - Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In like 10 minutes, Amazon transformed my old mirror into this confident, athletic, flexible, tough, determined, strong, focused, poised, Kobra Kai ass kicking machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sweep to the leg couldn&#x27;t keep Daniel down.  That moment when Ali comes bursting out of the locker room to tell the ring announcer that Daniel LaRusso&#x27;s gonna fight was the moment I put up this new mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much like the crane kick, this mirror cannot be stopped.  Move over Johnny Lawrence.  You&#x27;re washed up and ready for Just One of the Guys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this review didn&#x27;t sell it.  It comes with a squeegee.  It would be like if The Karate Kid was remastered in 3D or something.  I don&#x27;t even like 3D.  But I love the squeegee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the song at the end of the movie even before the inspiring guitar solo - You&#x27;re the best! Around! Nothing&#x27;s gonna ever keep you down!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please buy this mirror.  It will physically hurt me if you don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I followed all the instructions, put on plenty of adhesive, and waited a full 24 hours. I used it once, and it worked pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I came back home later, it had fallen down..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see a lot of people got some good use out of this, but for some reason mine just didn&#x27;t want to stick.</li>
    <li> The mirror arrived soon after ordering, Well packed and damage free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shower mirror performs much as depicted. If the water inside the mirror is hot enough there will not be any fogging, even in the steamiest of shower environment . I have been using the mirror while shaving with a lather from \\&quot;The Art of Shaving\\&quot; along with my old razor, and I find I get much smoother shaves than trying to shave at a sink.</li>
    <li> I initially had some problems hanging the mirrow. I posted a bad review and within two hours the company contacted me.  They sent me a new product. I tried it again and it worked perfectly. The fault was mine.  They receive my highest rating.</li>
    <li> The product arrived safely and on time. However it does not adjust very well.&lt;br /&gt;Good quality though.&lt;br /&gt;Not able to use as I wanted to.</li>
    <li> Easy to mount with the silicone provided.  Hot water keeps it form fogging</li>
    <li> Excellent mirror from ToiletTree, it&#x27;s easy to mount and includes a free squeegee.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this- makes his getting ready time quicker (probably because he doesn&#x27;t have to clean the sink!). I love it- mess free in the shower shaving! It actually does work!</li>
    <li> I purchased my Toilet Tree Fogless mirror about 30 days ago and have to say I am truly impressed with the Fogless performance as promised. I have to shave everyday for work and this mirror has worked perfectly. The convenient squeegee helps to get the water beads off the once filled with hot water the mirror stays clear. I recommend this to anyone that has to or likes to shave in the shower. It makes life easy</li>
    <li> I have been frustrated with so called \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; mirrors before.  However, this product works!  I thought it might be inconvenient to fill reservoir each time, but it takes less than 5 seconds and mirror stays completely fog free.  The built in squeegee is great and I get a clear mirror every time I shave.  Bought another one for our second home.</li>
    <li> I have tried a number of shower mirrors over the years but this is the first mounted one that actually works. I like the way that it mounts very securely with very little chance of it ever falling down, which was a problem I always had with previous mirrors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a small hassle having to fill the mirror with warm water but it does work surprisingly well and does not fog at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The inclusion of the squeegee makes a huge difference as well as it is really good at removing any water droplets that might splash on the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first got the mirror I was concerned that it might be to small, but once it was installed I have to say it is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with the whole setup!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s excellent .. I love it</li>
    <li> I love my ToiletTree Fogless Shower Mirror. It comes with a squeegee that slides on underneath the razor shelf. You fill the mirror with warm water which lets keeps the mirror from fogging at all. Forget to fill it? No worries. Rinse the mirror with water, fill it with hot water, and use the squeegee and you&#x27;re good to go. This is the best and last shower mirror I will own. I do not forsee ever using anything else.</li>
    <li> I have tried a few shower mirrors claiming to be &amp;#34;fog free&amp;#34; but none of them lived up to that claim. I like everything about this mirror. It&#x27;s very easy to install, stays put, easy to fill and empty, and really is fog free once hot water is in the container on the rear of the mirror. It&#x27;s also bigger than my previous mirror but still small enough for my shower. I have no complaints at all. It is such a hassle to keep wiping a mirror when you are trying to shave. This mirror saves time and makes for a better shave because you can actually see what you are shaving!&lt;br /&gt;I do have one suggestion: add a double razor holder on the mirror instead of a shelf. Family members often have more than one razor in the shower and this would just add to the overall functionality of the mirror. Again, just a suggestion.</li>
    <li> It does what it says: if you do not forget to fill it with hot water before use it does not fog. It stays firmly attached to the wall dthanks to the included glue. It&#x27;s one of those rubber type glues so you can always remove the mirror if you want to. The included rubber cleaner on the bottom is very convenient. Since mirros nowadays are made of plastic, I&#x27;ve scratched many of them while cleaning. This included rubber cleaner prevents the scratching. If your bathroom is not lit enough, you can get the model with lights &#x27;http://www.amazon.com/Squeegee-ToiletTree-Products-Guaranteed-Designed/dp/B005OSQGN8/ref&#x3D;pd_sim_bt_3?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;refRID&#x3D;1T6KVTSK1MYQQTM33W41&#x27;</li>
    <li> Easy to install -- do what they say regarding cleaning the mounting surface and letting the adhesive dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After that, it&#x27;s simple. Fill with water, brush squeegee down surface to clear droplets, and you&#x27;re off. I considered the higher end model with LED lights (and larger), but this is plenty big and, unless your shower is dark, the LEDs are not needed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product that will last for ~2 years, but is a hassle to remove (and sometimes causes damages.) I&#x27;ve owned three of them over the past ~5 years and can now write a pretty comprehensive review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s start with the good. Shaving in the shower is great, and this product makes it super easy. The set up is easy and while it isn&#x27;t super clear, it works more than well enough to shave with. The company also will send free mounting kits if you decide to move.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the bad. Over time, the mirror becomes less clear (but still usable.) The tilting mechanism wears out in a few years which is the biggest flaw. Once filled with water, there is no way to position it between the middle setting and the bottom setting without it &#x27;falling&#x27;. I contacted ToiletTree and was ignored. Last, it is advertised as removable but be cautious. I&#x27;ve mounted it on tile and twice on plastic. The second time on plastic is bonded so well (and the plastic was so weak) that it ripped a huge hole in the shower wall. My landlord will not be happy.</li>
    <li> works great...and if it wears out in a year or so, the cost isn&#x27;t much.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving in the shower for over 5 years and needed to replace my mirror/radio.  I decided the radio part was unnecessary and looked for the perfect shower mirror.  After reviewing a bunch, I decided to get this and I&#x27;m very happy!  I installed it as instructed and used it as recommended and it works perfectly.  The only drawback is that if I ever move, I don&#x27;t think it will come with me due to the product used to stick it to the tile.  It will never come off.</li>
    <li> Bought as Christmas present for husband.  It truely works and is fogless if you put in the hot water.  Husband loved it and it arrived when promised.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for xmas and was hesitant because I have heard from him that fogless mirrors don&#x27;t actually work. I took a change and he absolutely loves it! I asked him if he had anything bad to say about it before I wrote a review and he said &amp;#34;nope, it is awesome!!!!!!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Husband uses this daily. It does NOT fog up and stays VERY secure on the wall. Definitely would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> A very good product. Mounts firmly to shower (Tiled) wall. I get some splash from shower but the squeegee provided clears it in one swipe. Easy to remove to fill reservoir with hot water.  I have used other mirrors and have always had to spray them with anti-fogging solution. A real pain with less than desirable results. This mirror works 100% effectively if you fill with hot water before you begin shaving. Received this as a Christmas gift and installed it Christmas morning. Started to use it 24 hours later.Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Mirror works great- very easy to use and it does not fog over.  Great solution to more than one of us needing in the bathroom at the same time.</li>
    <li> I bought both the LED version and the non-lit version of these products for each of my bathrooms. The LED version is hit and miss because the light sometimes does not come on. I give it a few taps and shakes and suddenly it&#x27;ll work. Otherwise, it does it job by not fogging up and the tray is nice to have.</li>
    <li> This mirror is magnificent, and my husband loves it. It was easy to install, it never falls, and the reflection is crisp and clear.</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a Valentines Day gift for the hubby.  He wanted to shave in  the shower for a close shave...after reading reviews on other types decided on this....HE LOVES IT!!!  No fogging and easy install!!!</li>
    <li> The mirror works great. The squeegee is a fine addition. But for some plastic and a mirror it is somewhat expensive. 19.95 would have been perfect!</li>
    <li> It is a very dysfunctional cheep plastic mirror that fogs even while holding maximum amount of water also the hanging part is poorly designed no sticky cups just a bottle of cheep super glue?? Come on&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
    <li> SUPER FAST SHIPPING. PERFECT !!!!!</li>
    <li> The mirror works just as advertised.  It really has made shaving in the shower easier.  The mirror is very clear.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this mirror for about a month. I purchased this to replace a suction-cup style shaving mirror that used to fall off the wall frequently. This mirror was easy to install and is much better than my old shaving mirror. It is very secure on the wall and when you fill the reservoir with warm water it is completely fogless. I&#x27;ve already recommended it to two friends.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly after 2-3 months of use.  Does not fog when filled with water, and has stayed stuck to the shower wall with no issue.  Makes shaving in the shower quick and easy.  Purchased based on Sweethome review.</li>
    <li> I am impressed with their customer service.  I own their small no fog mirror and received an email from the CEO letting me know that if I was not satirized they wanted to make it right.  Wow!  This mirror lives up to its claims - in never fogs when you add the hot warm to the tank.  Make sure to use ALL the silicon and allow it to dry for 24 hours prior to use.  I have had had it for a few weeks and have not had any issues.  I shave in the shower and it has never fogged up.  Worth the price.  Highly recommended!  updated March 2015 been using it daily to shave in the shower - still stays on the wall. No problems.  Love it!</li>
    <li> greatest shower mirror in the history of mirrors. Never fogs, super big and it never falls down. Even has place to razor.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. I followed the mounting directions and so far, so good. It stays fog free for the entire duration of my shower.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product based on all of the great reviews on Amazon and it worked well 2 days after which problems started with the adhesive which has caused it to fall to the floor.I followed all the instruction and waited for 24 hrs before attaching the mirror to the bracket.Now it does not attach back to the shower wall and I am holding onto a defective piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the design in nice and easy to install.Would be great if there was a way to release the water but again I am not sure how to make use of the mirror now that I cannot stick it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was contacted promptly by the company and they have shipped me some additional adhesive.Hopefully this works and resolves the issue I had mounting the mirror.I was surprised that Steve from Toilettree reached out and will give them a thumbs up on customer satisfaction and increased the rating from 3 to 4</li>
    <li> I use to have one of those cheap fog proof mirrors which didn&#x27;t work at all.  After reading all the glowing reviews for this mirror I went ahead and ordered one.  It&#x27;s perfect.  Fill the back with warm water and it doesn&#x27;t fog up even a little bit.  It&#x27;s great to finally get something that works as described.</li>
    <li> Once I figured out how to use it and to refill the water chamber during each shower, it work well.  The built in squeegee is necessary to keep water droplets from collecting on the mirror.  I wish the stand was larger and would hold the shaving cream and have slots for the razor.  It appears to be the best currently on the market.</li>
    <li> This mirror fogs up as soon as you turn on the shower. It should be called the \\&quot;FOG mirror\\&quot;. Don&#x27;t waste your money if you are looking for \\&quot;fogLESS\\&quot;</li>
    <li> After replacing our so called fogless mirror every year, we are happy to find one that works logically without any gimmicks!  It arrived very quickly and was very easy to install.  It comes with a silicone adhesive that has to set for 24 hours, but it stick and there are NO SUCTION CUPS to deal with!!  Because it is &#x27;mounted&#x27; it has a very elegant look and gives our shower a kind of spa look.</li>
    <li> C-H-E-A-P plastic. Must have cost $3 to manufacture in China. Quality notwithstanding, this thing works GREAT. Truly, the best shower mirror I&#x27;ve ever owned. But definitely overpriced.</li>
    <li> Works good so far. Easy to use</li>
    <li> I have bought two of these so far as presents for guys. You know, those guys who have everything, but I bet you they do not have a mirror for shaving in shower that would not fog! I got great reviews back. We did a test, let hot shower run, and let the mirror fog, then fill the mirror with shower water and watch fog disappear. Another good pointer, if the shower is off while they shave, they can rinse the razor in the mirror, and empty it out when done showering. Although I do recommend installing it as directed, but if there isn&#x27;t in a good spot for it in the shower, you can use the mirror by propping it against a shower caddy or soap shelf.</li>
    <li> Truly FOGLESS mirror. Only drawback is that the glue needed to hold the piece seems permanent &amp; to remove or re-position the mirror is next to impossible without causing damage to the tiles. If you are ok with that you will have no regrets</li>
    <li> I purchased this product on 6.1.13, the mirror backing began to come off on 11.10.13 and thus it is no longer a mirror in certain areas of the window.  In addition when I orginally received the product the caulk was all dried up and i had to purchase my own to complete the installation.  Beware, short life span with this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: after posting my review I gave this product a negative rating.  I was shocked to receive an email from Steve Parisi, President of Toilet Tree Products.  Never in my life has a manufacture contacted me in order to learn how to make their product better.  I am now a devoted customer to this company.  Please consider giving them your business, there are not a lot of companies that care as much as they do about their customers!</li>
    <li> My order came lickity-split in perfect condition. Everything I neeed to mount came in the package. Just find where you want it, making sure you can insert and remove mirror easily, and follow the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just fill the mirror to about an inch from the top with warm water, slide onto the mount, shower and shave, no prob! Never fogs! When done, remove, empty, and use squeegie to remove beads of water. I stand on windowsill until next shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Henry razor fits on the mount until I&#x27;m ready to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product and would definitely recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving in the shower for many years and tried many different mirrors. All but two have failed, this being one that didn&#x27;t. The other was attached to your water supply so the hot water could continually heat the rear of the plastic reflective surface. Worked great for about a year and then started to leak. Switching to this one was easy...works great. I didn&#x27;t use the provided adhesive, though. I have a fiberglass shower and was afraid the silicone may not remove cleanly. I opted for 4 each 3M water resistant Command Adhesive strips. Each is rated for 5 pounds. I did remove the two squares of tape from the unit as well. May not be an issue on tile, but I didn&#x27;t want to chance it.</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror and I would definitely recomend it to others, however, my only complaint would be to put a handle on the squeegee.</li>
    <li> After almost two years, the mirror no longer stays upright when filled with water. I either have to bend down to shave, or hold up the mirror with my free hand. This is disappointing as I liked the product when it worked right. Removal is not an easy option because it is \\&quot;super glued\\&quot; to the tile.&lt;br /&gt;-------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;I originally gave this product one star. I am happy to report that I was contacted by the company and a replacement part was immediately shipped to me. The problem is now fixed and the mirror works fine. I am very impressed with the company follow-up and responsiveness to a quality issue and have changed my one star to five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you ToiletTree.</li>
    <li> There are small clips that adjust the mirror and hold it in place.  They didn&#x27;t last long.  Also, after a lot of use the mirror has started to have blue lines form across it.</li>
    <li> Nice mirror, for the money, just follow instructions on mounting, also using rubbing alcohol to clean everything, seems really strong right now, so I&#x27;m very pleased!!!!</li>
    <li> The mounting was very easy and after using it a few times I can say it works exactly as described. Thankfully I have plenty of lighting in the shower. It&#x27;s especially helpful that it&#x27;s track lighting so I was able to point one of the lamps towards the mirror. Otherwise, if your shower is a bit dark, you may want to consider the Deluxe model with includes built-in LED lighting.</li>
    <li> After doing a few weeks of research, this mirror kept coming up.  I finally broke down and bought it, I was skeptical, but this is a handy mirror to have.  It saves me a ton of time because I don&#x27;t have to shave twice now that I can see myself in the mirror.  FYI: when you dump out old water, don&#x27;t forget it&#x27;s freezing.</li>
    <li> The mirror is probably the best fog-free mirror that does just as advertised.  I&#x27;ve tried so many options but this works in a smaller bathroom that fogs up with little help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone looking for a fog free shower mirror.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this everyday and loves it. I mounted it to the wall in the shower and he uses it to shave fog free.</li>
    <li> I think this is a very good idea. I mostly like the fog-free feature. I like to shave in the shower, so this is GR8 for me. I do hope it is removable when the time comes.</li>
    <li> This is a really great product if you like to shave in the shower. It&#x27;s such a simple concept, it can&#x27;t not work. Filling it with hot shower water is all that it takes, and it just can&#x27;t fog up. Really liking this mirror.</li>
    <li> This is very heavy and does not stay up easy. It stayed up until we moved and reapplied brand new adhesive. It is only good for the first time it goes up.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband for christmas last year and he still uses it 8 months later.  Good gift item.</li>
    <li> This product is very simple in its design, and works just as advertised. I had an installation problem, which was my own fault, and their company and marketing director handled it very quickly and courteously. I am impressed with them.</li>
    <li> Only been using it for a few days but I love it so far.  Works just as described and it&#x27;s the clearest shower mirror I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> Works better than any mirror I have tried before. Should have glued it further from shower head as water splashes on it while shaving.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it!!!  He gets a much better shave shaving in the shower.  The price was right and he&#x27;s happy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for over a year now and am pretty happy with it. Product works great--no fog, stays stuck to wall, and I&#x27;m getting the closest shaves I&#x27;ve ever had. I would give it more like 4.5 stars instead of 5 for reasons below...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only (minor) complaints I have are from the land of first-world problems, but I&#x27;ll voice my complaints anyway since that is what we do here... hopefully the company takes some notice for the next generation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Squeegee requires 2 hands: first, the squeegee is a MUST.  This will not work without squeegeeing the mirror off--it gets covered in water droplets during the filling process. And, the squeegee really only works if you use two hands (one on each end). It fits cleverly along the shelf (out of sight), but that means there is no handle--just a long plastic rod and piece of rubber. Anyway, the few times I&#x27;ve put some shave gel into one hand and realized I hadn&#x27;t squeegeed yet led to some awkwardness trying to get the water off the mirror without losing the shave gel. (yeah, I know, cue the violins! LOL)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Color Scheme: It looks good enough if you had some sleek modern city bathroom with chrome everywhere, but for my bathroom, which is all earth tones and brushed nickel, the black and silver on this thing kind of sticks out like a sore thumb. I don&#x27;t usually give too many tours of my bathroom, so I&#x27;m okay with it, but if I had the choice, a nice earthy color would have been perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Brand Name makes me think of--eeewww: Okay, while we&#x27;re at it... \\&quot;ToiletTree\\&quot;??? I get the clever wordplay. If you are trying to envision a tree whose &#x27;fruits&#x27; are toiletry products, great--good marketing idea. BUT, the actually logo is of a tree, whose trunk is a toilet! So every time I look at the mirror, I think, &#x27;this company wants me to take a &amp;*%^ on them...&#x27; and then I have a chuckle and proceed to fill one hand with shave gel... [darn! I forgot to squeegee!]...</li>
    <li> This is an excellent mirrow eazy to install you just need make sure you put silicon on back of mirrow where it&#x27;s showing and you&#x27;ll be very happy  :)</li>
    <li> I am extremely happy with the Fogless Shower mirror that that you sent to my wife.  I have had 3 shower mirrors before but none of them really worked very well.  This one works like a charm.  Once I have the shower running I simply hold the reservoir up to the shower nozzle and fill it up.  It easily slides back on to the holder which is attached to my shower wall.  The warm water keeps it from fogging.  As a matter of fact it has never shown any sign of the least bit of fogging.  It also has a small squeegee that cleans off and droplets from the shower.  I am so pleased with the way that it works that I am going to get one for my Dad and my brother.</li>
    <li> Holds great to the wall of the shower. Easy to install and is very clear when taking a shower. Best mirror shower mount on amazon.</li>
    <li> So far so good! It was easy to hang and really is fogless. Was a great Christmas present for my husband!!</li>
    <li> I bought this shower mirror as a gift for my husband.  It&#x27;s pretty nice, but I cannot say how well it works as he decided to grow a beard and stop shaving awhile right after I had ordered it and before it arrived.  Will have to update this when he gets tired of his beard.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  Just add a little warm water when you get in the shower and it will remain fog free while you enjoy a hassle free shaving experience.  I have been using this product for over 3 years without any problems.  No more messes with trying to shave at the bathroom sink.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for my Boyfriend (he likes practical things he will actually use--go figure). It was easy to install on the shower tile, and he has told me several times that it is one of the best gifts he has ever gotten. On the plus side.. no more tiny hairs all around the sink!! SCORE!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror was easy to install and is very easy to remove to add the water (hence the &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; feature) and put back.. I can do it with my eyes closed! It also seems very sturdy. We love it!</li>
    <li> I have used several suction cup mirrors from BB&amp;B over the years. This mirror works as advertised!. Easy to install and use. I found the price acceptable given it works as intended and have purchased the travel version as well.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this. Now my dad has one and when we moved, we got a new one. It works great!</li>
    <li> I was delighted with this product which looks more expensive than it was.  The instructions for installation were simple, it is attractive looking and works superbly.  A great gift for that someone in your life who likes to shave in the shower And yes, if you follow the directions, it really is FOGLESS!</li>
    <li> I owned my mirror for over a year and noticed after 3-6 months that the mirror film on the inside of the water chamber began to deteriorate and peel. Where the film began to fail there were black splotches. This happened on both the bottom and top of the mirror, making it difficult to get a full unaltered view. As time went on the peeling got worse but I just worked around it because despite the peeling, the part that didn&#x27;t fail—the middle— did truly remain fogless. I do believe that with time the entire thing would&#x27;ve gone bad. We recently moved and I am again in need of a fogless shower mirror but hesitant to give this one another try.</li>
    <li> Best fogless mirror yet!</li>
    <li> I wish I had found this sooner. No more foggy mirror while shaving.</li>
    <li> Received this a week ago.  Installation was simple.  Mirror is great, and works exactly as described.  It&#x27;s great to be able to shave in the shower.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> For the price it isn&#x27;t worth the extra. I use to use a small FOG mirror. Every morning I soaped my hands then soaped the mirror. With this one I fill the back and then squeegee the front. I think that SOAPING the cheap mirror took less time and 25% of the price of this thing.</li>
    <li> This is without a doubt the best shower mirror out there. The silicone adhesive and tape works perfectly to hold mirror and base in place and the mirror is truly fogless, you just have to fill the reservoir in the back of mirror with warm water before each shower. Never will buy another shower mirror again!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my husband and he installed it in our shower.  It did not take long but had to sit overnight to make sure the glue had adhered correctly.  He loves having a mirror that does not fog and is right where he can see into it and it keeps him from cutting himself.&lt;br /&gt;We had no problems with shipping and handling and it arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> Finally a product that was advertised to work....&amp;#34;&#x27; IT DID  &amp;#34; .  I have enjoyed using it every morning, and without a doubt I would like to recommend that you shop no further.,, This is the real deal !!!&lt;br /&gt;I have told all my family, and they in turn have told their friends... Enjoy</li>
    <li> Purchased for my husband about 2 months ago and immediately installed on a tile shower wall.  No problems with adhesive, holds razor, and remains fog-free. Def Recommend!</li>
    <li> I like this mirror a lot. It my shower has a stone wall and I definitely didn&#x27;t want to drill holes. This sticks with silicon adhesive. So far so good. Seems secure. It has a reservoir in back that you fill with hot water from the shower to prevent fogging. Works fine. I have been using it for 2 weeks now with no fogging. The mirror reflection / image is reasonable clear and accurate. Overall it&#x27;s a well designed and implemented fogless shower mirror at a fair price. I like it a lot. I just gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the plastic material has a slightly lightweight (read: &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34;) feel, though this directly contributes to the light weight of the mirror which helps it adhere to the wall and makes it convenient to fill, so it&#x27;s understandable.</li>
    <li> Great idea, easy to use, and does exactly what it says - If you&#x27;re looking for a fogless mirror to put in your shower, this one simply works!&lt;br /&gt;The details: It comes with a silicone glue to mount to your shower , and once in place stays put. The mirror lifts off it&#x27;s base/wall mount easily so you can fill the hollow body with water from the shower (it takes all of 10 seconds to fill with the shower running). Once you slide the mirror back into the mount, there&#x27;s a squeegee (you can just barely see it under the razor in the pic) that slides out of a built-in holder which you use to wipe the mirror. Wipe, replace squeegee, and you&#x27;ve got a clear, fogless mirror for as long as you&#x27;re in the shower. Brilliantly thought out design, and highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I decided to ditch my old shaving mirror as part of a bathroom renovation.  After reading reviews this is the one I settled on and I&#x27;m glad I did.  The installation is very solid.  I love the size of it and it remains crystal clear no matter how steamy the bathroom is.  I&#x27;ll modify my review if needed as I use it over time.</li>
    <li> We have had this mirror for a few years and it has never fallen off or slid down the wall like other mirrors we tried.  We like it so much we bought one as a gift.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for about a week and as long as you fill the back of the mirror with hot/warm water the mirror remains perfectly fog free.  I gave it only 4 stars b/c of the fact that you have to take the mirror off of the wall and fill it with water, so slightly inconvenient but if thats what it takes to get a fog free mirror then it is what it is.  Overall Good product.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror. Never fogs when filled with water from the shower. Squeegee is great. Definitely recommend. Great buy!</li>
    <li> This product worked decently for about 6 months. Then the plastic piece that held it at an angle broke. I then started using it by balancing it on a shelf. The mirror part now does not stay fog free and it is beginning to be worn away. I feel you should put your money towards a longer term solution. This product will satisfy you for 6 months.</li>
    <li> Simple easy to install and use. I&#x27;ve had it for about a week now and can kick myself for not ordering it sooner.  The mirror installs quickly with easy to follow instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fill the resevoir with warm water when I first get in the shower. The mirror clears very quickly, so by the time I&#x27;m ready to shave, so is the mirror. The mirror itself is of ample size to include the whole face. When I&#x27;m done shaving, I empty the resevoir and use the included squeegie to clean the surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product for the price. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t really ask for much more out of a fogless shower mirror or a product than this. It&#x27;s simple to install, works as advertised and comes with everything you need to make it work. I&#x27;ve owned a number of shower mirrors in the past, and all of them were inferior to this mirror. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I bought it for my boyfriend who had &amp;#34;tried every fog less mirror&amp;#34;. This product is simple. Add hot water as you enter the shower and ZERO fogging throughout the entire shower. Great product.&lt;br /&gt;Side note: I would love to see hooks added to the bottom in the future to put bath supplies like loofah, etc.</li>
    <li> I bought this a second time for our second shower. It&#x27;s a great product and has become as essential as my razor and toothbrush. Besides, it&#x27;s fun to fill up the mirror and pour it on my head.</li>
    <li> I GOT THIS MIRROR IN OCTOBER 2014.  IT REALLY LIVED UP TO ITS NAME (FOGLESS SHOWER MIRROR). HOWEVER, AFTER LESS&lt;br /&gt;THAN 5 MONTHS THE TAPE HOLDING THE MIRROR IN MY SHOWER CAME LOOSE,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product really lived up to its name (fogless shower mirror). However after slightly less than five months of hanging in my shower the tape&lt;br /&gt;holding the mirror on the wall came loose and the mirror fell to the floor in my shower.  The mirror did not break but one of the plastic parts holding&lt;br /&gt;the mirror to the part that came loose from the wall did break and as a result I can no longer use the mirror. Over the years I have purchased&lt;br /&gt;many products from you and this was the very first one that I have been unhappy with.</li>
    <li> it seems well made and has surprisingly good optical quality. A hook to hang my razor and shaving brush would make it 5-stars, but that might not be universally desired.</li>
    <li> Once the cavity behind the mirror is filled with warm water, It most certainly is free of fog for the remainder of the shower. No big deal to fill; takes only seconds. Lose one star for not being adjustable for focus.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for some two weeks now and it has worked exactly as advertised.  Many in shower mirrors fog up after a while, but this remains clear if you follow directions by adding warm water to the reservoir behind the mirror before using.  An excellent product to say the least - highly recommended by me.</li>
    <li> Great product! Works well and shipped quickly</li>
    <li> Very happy with the Fogless Shower Mirror, I have had a few and so far this is the best. The other morning it had fog, I added hot water and the fog disappeared</li>
    <li> I used this to replace an older shave mirror that tapped into the shower head to run water through the back of the mirror to prevent fogging.  Absolutely love this one.  Takes seconds to mount and fill with water.  Never fogs and the light is just an added bonus.  Have used for a month now and am very happy.</li>
    <li> My son asked for this as a holiday gift. I purchased this here and it was shipped to him in great time. He is so spoiled by this now that he complains everywhere he goes to visit or on business trips that the shower does not have a mirror for him. I may have to get another one for my house so he wont complain when he comes home for a weekend.</li>
    <li> Bought this with a much less expensive shave mirror (Shave Well Company Deluxe Fog-Free Shower Mirror) for my husband thinking that he would take the Shave Well one with him when he travels for work.  But he hasn&#x27;t even put this one up in the shower ... he loves the other one.?.?  I&#x27;m sure he would like this one ... but wish I had only bought the other one.  Ah well ...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a proud bald guy that shaves his head in the shower.  I&#x27;ve gone through several mirrors, most of them using a coating to prevent fogging.  I found they&#x27;d always stop working over time.  Well after owning this for about two months, I can easily say, this is the best shower mirror I&#x27;ve ever owned.  It&#x27;s the perfect size for me, looks good, WORKS as advertised, and holds to the wall with ample strength!  Would buy again and again.</li>
    <li> Product works as advertised. Easy to set up, easy to use, works well, and lasts many years (have had original one for 5 years and many moves and still works fine).</li>
    <li> Shaving in the shower with a clear mirror saves me precious time every morning. The mirror installs easily, is secure and sturdy. The warm water solution for keeping the mirror fog-free is the only way to go.</li>
    <li> He loves it because it really doesn&#x27;t fog.....saves time as it can stay attached to wall, the one he had previously he had to remove each time, because it wouldn&#x27;t stay up and fall to shower floor if he didn&#x27;t take it down.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as advertised. Allows me to shave in the shower cutting my time in the bathroom by 20%. Stays clear for entire shower and shave.</li>
    <li> Had I written this review a year ago I would have said that I wished Amazon allowed for six stars. I had owned one of these mirrors for two years before needing to replace it due to the back wall piece no longer holding the mirror in place (It was also pretty water stained). I didn&#x27;t mind, I feel like 2 years for a $30 investment is well worth it. I spend more on shaving cream/razors over that period of time and I have to shave in the shower to avoid breaking out. This was a wonderful mirror and helped me to accomplish that during the two years that my old one was being used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, I have now purchased two of these mirrors since June, 2013. The first one came and was great for a month or two, but it started to develop an inch wide white line across the top (the reflective surface was peeling off), it leaked, and it eventually warped. None of my habits had changed and the water that I fill these with is the same water that I am showering in. I&#x27;m not super heating the water or doing anything that should cause this now, and wouldn&#x27;t have caused it in the old mirror. I got a hold of Amazon and they said that they would make an exception for me and extend the 30 day return period (This is why I shop at Amazon! Awesome customer service!) and allow me to return the product. I figured that I probably just got a bad egg, so I ordered a new mirror (still same one) expecting to be able to use the box to return my defective one. Well, the new mirror came and guess what? It leaks, too. Not just leaks, but has a constant drip that is very obvious. Within 5 minutes there is already fog developing where the water line no longer reaches. I guess I&#x27;ll be returning two of these, now. I&#x27;m pretty disappointed as I have recommended this mirror to a number of people and I really hope this didn&#x27;t happen to any of them. I might give it another shot, but my patience with this sort of thing are running thin. I don&#x27;t enjoy going to the post office to continually return thesame product because a company isn&#x27;t maintaining quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, if you happen to get one of these mirrors that works it is a great addition to the shower. You&#x27;ll be very happy that you invested in it and will not regret it. However, it seems to me like the odds are against you getting a quality experience right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 1/16/2014:&lt;br /&gt;After contacting the company I was very impressed with their response time and quality of customer service. They responded to emails very quickly and were eager to make this right. I give the company and the people working at it (family owned) 5 stars without hesitation. They were amazingly easy to deal with and I wouldn&#x27;t have any problems making a purchase from them again! After contacting them they sent me a new mirror to replace the one that was leaking all over the place. This was free of charge and completely on their dollar. Unfortunately, it is with a bit of regret (I have been avoiding writing this because I don&#x27;t like to taint a good name, and the number of leaking mirrors that I&#x27;ve gone through is starting to get a bit unreal) that I have to write that I am 3/3 so far as mirrors leaking. Fortunately, the latest one only leaks marginally (it lasts a whole shower, unlike the last one), but that&#x27;s how my first one started and it only got worse until the top quarter of the mirror became a non-reflective white line. As I said earlier, the company itself is phenomenal, they go out of their way to make their customers happy. Unfortunately, I&#x27;m either getting all of the refurbished leaking mirrors, or there is a problem with quality inspection on the production line. I&#x27;m guessing that it&#x27;s the latter of the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to keep using the mirror until it dies, but considering that I owned one for two years without a hitch, I&#x27;m scratching my head about the short lifespan of the current mirrors. I&#x27;ve tried pinching the back and front together to see if there was a problem with the way that they were put together, but no such luck. It appears as though it&#x27;s just going to keep dripping until it either gives out, or I go and plug the seam with some gorilla glue or something along those lines. I&#x27;m sad to say it, but but getting three out of three leaking mirrors within the past year indicates something more than bad luck (maybe extremely bad luck?) and I hope that Toilettree gets it fixed so that I can continue to enjoy their mirror products!</li>
    <li> Great mirror, a little pricey for the level of quality but definitely fog free. Take the time to mount it right.</li>
    <li> I installed this mirror in the shower in the last place I lived and left it there upon moving. I was so lost without it here for the new one to arrive from Amazon. It is such a simple solution to a problem I have tried to solve all kinds of ways with partial success, but this is the best. One suggestion I would make however and that is because I am farsighted. I wish they had an option of a magnifying version. For this reason, I rate it a 4.75 out of 5.</li>
    <li> Works just like they said, looks great, stays on the wall no problem been there a year and hasn&#x27;t come off!  My water is a bit &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; so it does show water spots and I am afraid to you anything abrasive to clean it like I would the shower stall, but it doesn&#x27;t affect the use.</li>
    <li> I have had this for nearly a year, it works great and is built to last. I was a little skeptical at first, but really glad I got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a HUGE time saver and give the opportunity to save time and get a great shave</li>
    <li> Really like this product and the two-way tape combined with the liquid adhesive works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If would have been a better price point I would have given this 5 stars as it is all plastic so should not be so costly.</li>
    <li> This product worked great for about 6 months before the mirror started looking very &amp;#34;Milky&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I would love to purchase a version of this with actual glass, or similar quality.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  Suction cups are very sturdy and keep this from falling in the tub- that could get very annoying. Husband uses this for a shave, or to make funny faces at himself while in the shower!  This works by filling the reservoir in the back with warm/hot water.  Take notice- do not use a scouring pad to clean this. My husband did this and destroyed the mirror.</li>
    <li> This is a good sized mirror and very true, it does not fog up. Four stars because the shelf for the razor is too narrow. It would be better if it was slightly angled inward to make sure the razor does not fall or had a non-slip surface.</li>
    <li> Just basic physics; heat up the mirror and moisture will not condense on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If one wants to shave ones face in the shower, I don&#x27;t see a better product to do it with. I&#x27;m in my 70&#x27;s and have had plenty of time to try every mirror for doing this and no matter what they claim is on their mirror to prevent fogging, they don&#x27;t work long.</li>
    <li> Bought it as Christmas gift &amp; my husband loves it. Worth the price. Love it! Looks good &amp; works great.</li>
    <li> Was a gift for my son-in law,  He loves shaving in the shower so my daughter recommended it. He loved it.</li>
    <li> I really like the product. The product works as intended. It is indeed a fogless mirror and I love my showers hot. I&#x27;ve been using it to shave in shower ever since I got it. The only complaint really is the slightly strange way it shows your reflection from certain distances.</li>
    <li> ordered and came on time in good shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kinda wierd to have to put hot water behind the mirror each time you use it but it workd great.</li>
    <li> The installation, combining double sided tape for immediate positioning and silicone adhesive for secure attachment, worked well.  The mirror is large and easy to slide onto the base, for refilling with warm water.  This minimizes this difference in temperature and ensures the mirror remains fogless.</li>
    <li> Great for shaving in the shower. Would definitely recommend. It stays put and has never fallen even after 6 months of use.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent mirror for use in the shower. It was simple to install and has stayed firmly attached to the shower wall. When you fill the reservoir with water, it really does stay fog free. The squeegee and small shelf are two nice touches that make this well worth the price. The mirror itself works very well for shaving.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product. Also, called the manufacturer of this item with a quick question and was immediately assisted.</li>
    <li> I chose this item based on my research for fogless shower mirrors. I love the product because it is exactly as advertised and simple to use. I highly recommend the product after personal use for a few months.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I have ordered three for different bathrooms over the last 2 years. Works perfectly and finish looks smart and holds up well to water and humidity. Love this product!</li>
    <li> I acknowledge that this works as it&#x27;s supposed to, and its design is attractive.  I have the brushed steel looking one which matches our other brushed steel / brushed nickel in our bathroom.  I think it comes in black or white as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me describe how to use the devices:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. when you&#x27;re in the shower, you reach up and lift the &amp;#34;mirror&amp;#34; part off of the base which is glued to your shower wall.&lt;br /&gt;2. hold the &amp;#34;mirror&amp;#34; (which has a water receptacle on the back of it) under hot water for maybe 15 seconds to allow it to fill with hot water&lt;br /&gt;3. put the mirror back on the base by trying to line up some notches on the back of the mirror with some vertical guides on the base.  This isn&#x27;t terrible difficult, but does take a little concentration and sometimes 3-4 tries to get it on right.&lt;br /&gt;4. at this point the mirror should stay fog free for the forseeable future (as long as the water in the mirror receptacle is warm)&lt;br /&gt;5. when you&#x27;re done showering, dump the water out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not so sure this is a better solution than just wiping the fog from a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; mirror a couple times while you&#x27;re shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I already installed mine and it looks pretty good, so I&#x27;ll leave it there.  Whatever.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t order it again though.</li>
    <li> Finally replaced an old shower mirror with this one and it works as promised.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror. It was easy to mount on the shower wall per the instructions, and filling it with hot water from the shower immediately clears the steam, and the mirror stays perfectly clear the entire time it takes to shave. It is easy to fill, easy to empty, easy to clean water droplets with the squeegee. My only quibble, for which I did not deduct any stars, is that the adjustable tilt feature is hard to adjust. In fact I adjusted it for myself before I mounted the mirror. I would recommend this product to anyone who likes shaving in the shower.</li>
    <li> Good size mirror that doesn&#x27;t fog. Comes with a squeegee to clear the water droplets for a clear reflection.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I had used an old one from Sharper Image for years that broke and I couldn&#x27;t find it. This is easy to install and works great. The mirror comes off and you fill with water from shower and it is fog free while you shave.</li>
    <li> Great mirror.  It is fog free when used correctly.  Just refill the water each shower.  Others claim fog free but the instructions will have you wiping the mirror with soap which just leaves a residue.  Not with this mirror.  It only loses a star because it is a plastic mirror and does not give an accurate reflection.  For shaving, it doesn&#x27;t matter to me.  Others may not be completely satisfied with the one downside.</li>
    <li> Buy different silicone!  This does connect to the shower in a rather permanent way, but you can pull off the mirror to fill it with water (that is how it stays fogless.)  The silicone that has came with the 2 toilettree products both didn&#x27;t last long.  Bought a little better stuff from Home Depot and have had nothing fall off since.  Very happy with this mirror otherwise.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  It performs exactly as advertised.  It was easy to install and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> Bought for my fiance, he shaves in the shower now and he has had no complaints.  You fill up the back with the shower water and it stays fog free.  It has been in our small stand shower for over a year now and it has not fallen at all. There is a shelf for the razor below it and it fits the razor no problems.</li>
    <li> Update: 6/25/2015 I contacted their customer service at their website and to my surprise, I received a response back within 12 hours. They also sent me a double sided silicone adhesive strip in the mail for free. Kudos to your great Customer Support.  I love this product and the way it works. I am going to move shortly and there isn&#x27;t much information on how I can remove this and carry it with me to wherever I move. Some information on the type of adhesive and instructions will be handy.</li>
    <li> I have been using fogless mirrors in the shower for years. They all start off good, and then about two days later, they fog up and eventually fall off (at 3am to wake me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read a review of the Toilet Tree fogless mirror and figured I would try it. Best investment made thus far. You lift the mirror off the base and fill it with the hot shower water. Adds a few seconds to your routine, but well worth it. Squeegee the mirror with the supplied squeegee (stores in shelf, very handy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to use and a great product. There is a shelf to lay your razor. My only product design recommendation is to add a hook to hold a shave brush, but nothing I couldn&#x27;t solve with a suction cup hook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of this mirror as all others did not last long.  I have a tiled shower with uneven surface tile.  I went through a half dozen suction cup models over the years.  They do not last long.  You will hear a loud crash when the cups fail and find the mirror in a dozen pieces on the shower floor.  This model uses a synthetic clear adhesive to attach the mount to the wall.  They give you plenty of adhesive.  There are lines where you apply the adhesive to the mount.  When you push and squeeze it to the wall, the adhesive is forced out with a total seal.  You just wipe up the excess while it is still wet.  I used a small level to make sure it was even.  You have to fill the top of the mirror with warm water to keep it from fogging up and it slides onto the mount.  I have used this mirror for over six months and it is working great.  You can even adjust the tilt a bit.  I will purchase another one for the other shower.  Good luck.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how much time you could save by shaving in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Shower Mirror was every bit worth the cost.  I have had this for a while now and is still working as intended, although the plastic gears on the side have worn out and the mirror slants down, nothing to flinch at when you consider how amazing this thing is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has everything you would need to make your morning ritual go so much smoother, installs in minutes, works as intended, everything you want for a good buy.&lt;br /&gt;So buy it, don&#x27;t wait.</li>
    <li> The mirror works just as described!  You have to fill it with warm water for it to be fogless.  Best shower mirror that I have bought!</li>
    <li> Its been a little less than a year since I purchased this for my husband and it works great...mirror still does a nice job of eliminating the fog and is holding up nicely. Very happy with this purchase</li>
    <li> Fogs up. This was a gift for my husband and he is very disappointed with it.</li>
    <li> I have had it for months now and it works well.  I trust that this will out last others I have had with suction cups.</li>
    <li> Mirror is nice and large and doesn&#x27;t distort your image like cheaper ones. Stays fogless when used as instructed. Only complaint is the distance it sticks out from wall. I have a small shower and you have to be careful not to hit it scratch your face.</li>
    <li> works great, serves purpose, worth the money - great gift for the male in your life!  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product is made entirely of plastic and some non-glass reflective surface, which has both pros and cons.  The pros are that it is light weight and with the securing adhesives provided is extremely unlikely to fall from where it is mounted.  It also will not rust, and the reflective surface will not shatter.  The reservoir based design seems to work well; I have not experienced any fogging.  The cons are that the product looks and feels a bit cheap, and even noting the innovative design does not seem a good value at $30.  That being said, I have not found a better replacement and plan to keep and continue using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, I found shaving in the shower had some challenges - mainly poor light compared to my bathroom mirror and using a lot of water if I kept the water running while I shaved.  I have gotten better shaving in the low light and now turn the shower off and have a cup to rinse my razor.  One big plus - my wife and I no longer fight over sink space in the morning and rinsing off in the shower is very quick and easy.</li>
    <li> It works excellent, but the mirror that I have had for at least 15 years that had lived its life was much bigger and easier to use.  I am getting us to it and it will be fine, just used to a bigger frame.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband for an early Fathers Day gift, he loves it.  Easy installation and does everything it lcaims.</li>
    <li> I have had 2 other mirrors over the years - and neither really worked. This one take a little work - you need to fill it with water and use the squegee - but darn it works well!</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; shower mirror I&#x27;ve tried, and the only one that actually works. It is simple to use, durable and effective. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Such a great fog free mirror. We have had 2 years now and my husband still loves it. Adding water to the back is an awesome design that truly works.</li>
    <li> If you are able to follow instructions, this is a truly fogless shower mirror. Easy to mount and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the fogless shower mirror for about 2 months and I must say, it has worked perfectly thus far. I was a little skeptical to purchase the mirror as I had purchased 2 others, different brands, over the years and they simply did not work. This one has worked perfectly and I will be purchasing 2 additional as Christmas presents for friends.</li>
    <li> I have had this mirror for about a month, and I am very happy with it.  All plastic construction means it won&#x27;t rust.  The mirror is large and very clear and the included squeegee helps keep it from getting spots.  You affix this to the shower wall using two small pieces of double sided tape and silicone adhesive.  I believe the double sided tape is there just to hold it in place while the silicone adhesive drys.  The silicone adhesive means it won&#x27;t fall off the wall in the middle of the night, like a suction cupped mirror would, but you do need to sure of the mirror placement when you stick it up.  Overall, I am very happy with this mirror and would recommend it to anyone who likes to shave in the shower.</li>
    <li> I love this item, we use it daily for when I scrub my face and my fianc&amp;eacute; shaves. This device is so handy, it hasn&#x27;t fallen and the fogless mirror actually works. I was hesitant at first but so glad I made this purchase in the end.</li>
    <li> It really stays fog free and all you have to do is quick remove it from it&#x27;s slider mount, fill with the shower water and replace it on the wall.  That easy.</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this bad boy out of the box. But what shocked me the most was the picture of this guy was actually in the mirror. So every time I use it shave my gentleman&#x27;s luggage, this guy is staring right up at me. I thought it quite unnerving at first, but I have grown to enjoy the security of this strangers face looking up at me every time I need to weed my man-garden.</li>
    <li> Fell off the bathroom wall 15 minuets after applying and the plastic tab broke off.  So I tried to use it by propping up in my shower and it fogged up.  Sent it back the next day.  I don&#x27;t know how this product got four stars, it stinks.</li>
    <li> I chose this item because it showed great reviews.  it was a bit pricy but i was tired of poor quality and poorer results.  had it a month and not one trace of fog.  works as advertised.  I&amp;#34;m a little surprised with the overall quality of the product (based on upscale cost).  it is simply moulded plastic that looks classy.  the same could have been accomplished in a more basic design for half the price.  it does look classy...</li>
    <li> I shave in the shower. I got tired of those fogless mirrors that kept fogging up. I read the reviews of this item and decided to go for the premium mirror. I installed it per the easy to use directions and WOW, I could see where I was shaving. I like the squeegee too. The larger that usual mirror size was perfect. Thanks for a great product.</li>
    <li> This shower mirror worked flawlessly for the first year I had it, but it&#x27;s slowly been getting foggier and foggier, and now two years later it&#x27;s nearly unusable.  If you don&#x27;t mind replacing it every few years, I&#x27;d recommend it.  But, if you want something that will last longer, keep looking.</li>
    <li> I researched shower-ready shaving mirrors and decided against those that came with fog-resistant coatings and required re-application of a coating you had to purchase (and rely on the supply to remain available.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mirror works on a simple principle, which, in reading some of the negative reviews, some people aren&#x27;t following.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Behind the mirror is a small reservoir that takes about 3 seconds to fill with warm water in the shower. Fill it up and the mirror will not fog. That simple. It even comes with a squeegee so you can wipe away the water droplets. It&#x27;s works every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only two issues are: a) I wish there was just a tad of magnification on the mirror so you can see your neck &amp;#34;closer&amp;#34;, and b) the mounting stand is quite big, so it takes some room in a small shower. I wish they had designed a way you could hang or mount the mirror itself without using the stand. The squeegee fits fine in the reservoir and my razor already has a home in the shower caddy,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, this mirror is the real deal and if it doesn&#x27;t work for you, you didn&#x27;t read the directions!</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews but I got this for Christmas and it works flawless. You just fill the top mirror up with Hot water and the mirror doesn&#x27;t fog at all! Could not ask for a better product and easily worth the 30 bucks. One thing to note is that it comes with a tube of adhesive to help mount it to your shower so make sure that you are willing to keep it there, the mount is not made to be moved from shower to shower.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband for Christmas.  The last few mirrors he had in the shower all fell and shattered.  Even the &amp;#34;shatter-proof&amp;#34; one.  This is a nice sized mirror and it went up with no problem.  He likes it, so I like it.  So far, so good.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great mirror, easy to clean, stays fog free with the water you add. I always forget to empty the water, but I have to shave every day so it&#x27;s no biggie. I&#x27;m kind of bummed I didn&#x27;t realize there was a white version, but c&#x27;est la vie. I definitely don&#x27;t have to worry about it falling. Be forewarned, you are securing this with silicone sealant and two double sided tape squares. It can come off, but only if you really, really want it to...</li>
    <li> My son shaves in the shower.  He was using a tiny mirror.  I thought this would be a greatly appreciated gift and I was right.  I gave it to him for Christmas and he loves it.  Works Great!</li>
    <li> This mirror is amazing, so well designed. The bracket is well adhered to the wall, and does not fall off. I was worried about leaving the mirror full of water, if it would pull off the wall. No worries, its a perfect adhesive. You are supposed to empty it after use, but I never remember. All mirrors fog in the shower, but when you fill the back with warm shower water, it gets crystal clear. Works perfectly, always. I have hard water, and the mirror was getting water spots. I contacted the company, they suggested a coat of auto polish would keep that from happening. Then, they sent me a new one anyway!! Fantastic people, wonderful product. I also found any easy way to keep it clear, just use Lime-Away. Doesn&#x27;t harm the finish, and a quick cleanup every couple of weeks keeps it sparkling. This thing does exactly what you expect.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband - I&#x27;ve lost track of how many &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; shower mirrors he has gone through that usually are not really fogless!  This one, however, actually works, although you must read and follow the directions.  I love that it&#x27;s adjustable, too, so that I can use it sometimes.</li>
    <li> Great Product. We got it as a Christmas present for Daddy and he loves it. It works just like it said it would. No fogging if you keep warm water in the reservoir. Great product and would  recommend it for all dads!</li>
    <li> Works great, serves its purpose in an easy to use way. No need to buy expensive alternatives. Install opposite wall of showerhead for best results.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband, who travels a lot and he has wanted a fog less shower mirror for ages.  He lives it!!  He put up the mirror with squeegee in our bathroom and packed a suction cup to use with the travel mirror.  He is amazed at how good it works.  Am well pleased that this has worked out great for him.</li>
    <li> Great fogless mirror.  I have tried several others that fail after a few months,  this one is well built and a great deal.  the only thing that would make this better is if it had a place to hang your razor and not just set it on a shelf.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for about three weeks. Have not had any issues with it coming off the wall (I used the included silicone as instructed). I have owned 4-5 shower mirrors that were supposedly &amp;#34;fog free&amp;#34; and utilized some sort of plastic coating which never really worked but this mirror is truly fogless. Once you fill up the reservoir just go over the mirror with the included squeegee and you are good to go.</li>
    <li> Over the last several years, I have bought several fogless shower mirrors, but they were the type that allegedly involved some sort of coating on the mirror surface.  They worked for varying lengths of time, but never longer than a few weeks.  I was amazed that so many products could be sold that just didn&#x27;t work.  I got this ToiletTree Shower Mirror for Xmas and it works amazingly well.  It does require 20 seconds of prep, as you have to fill the tank with hot shower water.  But once that is done, there is no fog at all for the duration of your shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, ToiletTree!</li>
    <li> I love it. Just as advertised. Nice big mirror has made shaving in the shower a breeze. I would recommend to anyone looking for a shower mirror.</li>
    <li> The design where you add water behind the mirror is very easy to use and works great.  The adhesive works well and the unit is very easy to install.  Good buy.</li>
    <li> I GOT TO GET MORE OF THESE FOR GIFTS</li>
    <li> Great product thank you very much for a great buy. I would surely recommend this product to a friend. Works great!</li>
    <li> This is a shower mirror what can you say... Well this one lets you say quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was looking for a mirror I wanted something that was going to let me cut my hair with my clippers as well as shave my face, so the mirror needed to pivot. Check!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really hate using those tiny mirrors where you constantly need to adjust the mirror or yourself every time you move out of a 3 or 4 inch area. This mirror is one of the biggest I have found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last thing I was looking for was anti-fog, I like to shave in the shower after warming up my face under the water so this needed to be able to keep from fogging up. I have used anti-fog mirrors in the past and they don&#x27;t stay fog-less for log so I was not expecting much in this department. This unit shines in this area, the mirror slides off its wall mount and you fill it up with hot water from the shower/tub and within a few seconds it is the same temperature as the shower thus no fog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I have for this product is that it feels a bit flimsy, it has not given me any issues in terms of cracking or breaking but it feels like the plastic frame should have been a bit thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need a good shower mirror that is not going to fog this is the unit you have been looking for!</li>
    <li> I had a suction cup shower mirror that stuck well to my shower door, but it required a spray to keep clean and stay fog free with more \\&quot;deep cleanings\\&quot; every 3-6 months or so. I still expect to have to perform the deep cleans on this mirror, but no recurring charges or expenditures to buy more spray. I was a little concerned when I bought the mirror because I wasn&#x27;t 100% sure it was going to work (despite mostly very good reviews) and the initial price was more than the cost of a cheap suction cup mirror. However, there is a reason why. The mirror quality is very good and the build quality seems to be excellent. (Only on week 2 so far.) My other concern was that even if the mirror did work, I thought that having to fill it with hot water from the shower head would take forever and be a pain. This is absolutely not the case. It only takes about 15 seconds to fill with my head and spray pattern and there is absolutely no fog build up. Even with the fog less sprays on my el&#x27; cheapo mirror, there was still fogging around the edges usually. This mirror stays fog free across the entire surface for quite some time. In fact, so long, I haven&#x27;t seen fog on it unless two cases exist. The first case is during the shower and I haven&#x27;t filled it yet. The second case is also during the shower and I realize that I forgot to pour it out after I was done using it during the last shower and the water is cold. Both cases are a no brainer and to be expected - it&#x27;s called science. Mounting requires no screws, only silicone adhesive (which is provided) and some double sided adhesive squares (also provided) to hold the mirror in place while the silicone adhesive (primary mounting force) has time to cure. Instructions state specifically not to rely on the adhesive squares alone so don&#x27;t run that experiment. I debated on whether or not to use some water/humid environment rated Command (a registered trademark of 3M) adhesive strips from 3M but decided to go ahead with the manufacturer&#x27;s recommendations. However, if you are considering using the 3M Command strips like I was, I think they would work just fine. Especially if you used 3 or 4 of the 6 lb rated ones (I like overkill as a form of cheap insurance in some cases), but I didn&#x27;t want to have to figure out how to angle them and have the ends (which you have to pull on to easily remove the 3M strips) sticking out and showing when the mirror was on OR off for filling. I highly recommend this mirror. If that ever changes, I will revise this review.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A BEST BUY EVER!!!!  IT DOES WHAT IT SAYS IT WILL DO&lt;br /&gt;EASY TO MOUNT AND EASY TO USE.... BUY ONE YOU WON&#x27;T REGRET IT</li>
    <li> I got this for my boyfriend 2 Christmases ago. The mirror still looks like new after 2.5 years!!  There is no soap scum at all, which is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also got the traveling version, but that one doesn&#x27;t work as well. There&#x27;s a lot of soap scum on that one, but it&#x27;s still usable.  So if you don&#x27;t need to move it, get this one instead of the traveling one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t even need to use warm water. As long as the water is the same temperature as your shower, there&#x27;s zero fog. Highly recommended. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. It&#x27;s so easy to refill the water. Just lift it up, fill it with the shower water, and slide it back down. Another important thing is it has never fallen down unlike our last mirror.</li>
    <li> Works great and well worth the price! Couldn&#x27;t have found a better mirror. I have tried so many but this simple mirror works great!</li>
    <li> Great mirror!!!! I never shaved in the shower until now, this mirror is everything the Mfg said it would be. It was easy to install and works great every time. The squeegee is a cool feature since water can splash onto the mirror when showering. I never have a good place to store my razor but with this product the shelf is a perfect place to keep it. Thanks Toilettree for a mirror that works</li>
    <li> I have been through a number of fogless shower mirrors and this is the first one that (so far) really seems to work without becoming cloudy. I especially like that it can be mounted anywhere in the shower; it&#x27;s not dependant on the flow of water to the shower head.  I do think that the squeegee is a bit flimsy; a regular shower squeegee works better.</li>
    <li> I am thrilled to report my satisfaction of this brilliant item.  Having experienced other inferior attempts to accomplish fog-less shaves,  this one  works perfectly.  Also impressed by Amazon&#x27;s arrangement with a drop-ship from the factory.  Everything perfect including stellar packaging and instructions.  There is a slight image distortion but hey,  who can see that great when you just wake up in morning.  After all, I appear to be better looking while shaving   or singing.</li>
    <li> I have been through many fogless mirrors.  They all worked based on some type of coating technology.  Problem is it always wears off.  This fogless mirror works on simple physics!  The hot water placed behind the mirror keeps it from foging.  The best part is, PHYSICS ALWAYS WORKS.  So this will be the last fogless mirror you purchase.  It works perfectly, and will continue to work perfectly forever.  I am thrilled to have found it.    One consideration, you must fill the container (takes all of 15 seconds) each time it is used.  For me, this is no big deal.  Again, it is glorious to have a product that works exactly as you want it to work.  The mirror quality is much better than the other fogless mirrors I&#x27;ve seen as well.</li>
    <li> Works great for my boyfriend when shaving!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you ToiletTree Products! :)</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product that I am glad I purchased. Unlike other mirrors with suction cups this one actually stays on the shower wall. It comes with adhesive that ensures it will not fall off of the shower wall. The idea that you put hot water in the mirror is an ingenious way to ensure there is not fogging. This mirror beats more expensive mirrors as it just works. I recommend this product. Additionally, this store has great customer service. A+++</li>
    <li> Bought it because of the other highly rated reviews.  Everyone&#x27;s comments are true.  It really is &#x27;fogless&#x27;.  Just remember to fill the reservoir with warm/hot shower water before each use and empty it when done.  Great product!</li>
    <li> This mirror works as advertised as long as you follow the directions.  Empty water when done, fill with warm water when starting a shower.  That simple.  Remains fogless throughout showering experience no matter how long I lollygag!  Would be even better with built in vanity light.</li>
    <li> Simple,neat, easy to mount and adjust. Have had for five years and still use it.&lt;br /&gt;Easily worth the cost. Good quality.</li>
    <li> Never had a fog issue again. The genius behind the design of this mirror just makes me want to clap my hand and say BRAVO!</li>
    <li> The clear image of this mirror when I received it was STUNNING!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took this for a spin and a good hot shower where mirrors would naturally fog, THIS one didn&#x27;t fog at all. Truly was a great idea to have the shower&#x27;s water to keep the mirror from fog but at the same time it IS a major flaw. You use water, and to households which hard water is pumped into there is a big problem. The mirror after only 4 uses is filled with hard water stains, at this rate nothing will be visible by 3 or 4 months. You see, it is a problem with the water so I am not taking ANY stars away but then again it IS designed with water in mind and should had taken this into consideration. The squeegee was horrible to use but I made sure of wiping the water away each use.</li>
    <li> This is my second mirror.  It absolutely works great and is completely fogless once you fill it with warm water.  I only wish they made a version that had its only water line that hooked into the shower so that you didn&#x27;t have to fill it manually.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t fog up in the shower.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mirror to use in the shower and to prevent fogging. Well it works as advertised. Only downside is remembering to empty the shower water out of the mirror before exiting the shower.</li>
    <li> Only mirror I&#x27;ve found that is completely fog free.  Seriously, look no further.</li>
    <li> It is the best shaving mirror I have ever had.  just fill up the back with water and it never fogs up!  Easy to mount and it has stayed in place in the shower......</li>
    <li> This seemed like the perfect shower/shaving mirror. However, once I read the instruction, I realized that in order to keep it fog free you have to take it off the wall mount, fill it with hot water and place it back in the mount. Then it suggest emptying the water when finished. Just too much trouble to go through each and every time I shave.</li>
    <li> This actually works, unlike a Brookstone product I purchase that just claimed to be fogless.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace one I purchased from Bath &amp; Body Works.  This is a much better mirror and was half the price.  Once you fill it with hot water it is effectively fog free.  The squeegee and razor shelf is a nice addition.  The plastic is light but properly positioned you should get a lot of use from this mirror.</li>
    <li> Did not hold to the shower wall even though installed as reccommended.</li>
    <li> Mirror works great and no more missed spots when I shave. Adhesive is strong, even when the mirror is filled with water. Have had it installed for over a month now and am very impressed with it, especially for the price point.</li>
    <li> kinda annoying, i used it for about a month and then stopped.. you have to put hot water in it every moring .</li>
    <li> Mirror works perfectly, easy install, easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Works perfect my fiance loves it!</li>
    <li> (The mirror, not the face in it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was planning to mount this on the side wall opposite the shower head, but the side view of the mirror and bracket is very unattractive.  Something to consider if you have nice tile.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned many (more expensive) shower mirrors for shaving, and so far this works the best. I was skeptical of having to fill it with water, but it really does work. I mounted it with a few water resistant command strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: It really works. The squeegee helps too. Easy to mount with command strips.&lt;br /&gt;CONS: You have to fill it with warm water. Looks like a cheap as-seen-on-tv product. The ToiletTree logo on the front is not attractive. I&#x27;ve forgotten to empty the water reservoir a few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Had several of these in the past and all continued to fog up. This one is the best so far. Does not fog up at all. Awesome! Thanks.</li>
    <li> I bought this for shaving in the shower to replace an old grimy mirror. I was a tad displeased that it did not come with suction cups for sticking to the shower wall, but after looking at the ad again, this was my fault for missing. Turned out to be a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the mirror with its stand and have it placed on a shower rack that hangs from my shower head. This is ideal placement. The top of the mirror is just below the flow of water coming out of the head. When I am ready to shave a just point the shower head down and it fills up the back of the mirror with hot water, and no more fog! The squeege that comes with it is great as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Very satisfied with this well designed product.</li>
    <li> while it works well, once you fill it with the water from the shower and then using squeegee to clear mirror. would be a much better product it it came with a sealed gel behind mirror that took on temperature of the room and would not fog saving the step of filling same and dumping.</li>
    <li> I got this Shower Mirror for my husband like a gift on Christmas. He loved it from the first look! It is very comfortable and easy to use product.</li>
    <li> If you are like me, and have wondered why you nobody can make a &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; shower mirror, wonder no longer. I&#x27;ve had mine for about a year now and it is flawless. Genius!!!!</li>
    <li> a great product that works just like they say it will and the great customer service is something I couldn&#x27;t believe ..... it actually exists!</li>
    <li> we are very happy with this mirror! P.S. Don&#x27;t forget to read the instructions carefully and enjoy this wonderful purchase.</li>
    <li> I purchased the is for shaving in the shower. I followed the directions and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. No complaints here.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving in the shower for fifty years. Got to be good at shaving blind. No mirror worked. This sounded like a real solution and it is. I&#x27;ve had it over a month and it is great. By easily filling up the reservoir with the hot shower water you get a clear view to shave. The perfectly sized squeegee just makes it.  Installing it required me to read a few instructions and only took a few minutes. At the end of my shower I pour out the water, usually on me. I really like this mirror.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t review items, maybe I&#x27;ll start regularly but maybe not.  Regardless this mirror works so great it lead me to tell you about it.  I went through a cheap &amp;#34;shower&amp;#34; mirror every 6 months or so.  I&#x27;ve had this for 4 years and it still works as great as the day I received it. It doesn&#x27;t fog or even have buildup on it. If you like to shave in the shower, it is the perfect product.</li>
    <li> This really does the trick, by keeping the temperature steady through the shower.  The best one we&#x27;ve had.  Ladies, if you haven&#x27;t trained your man to shave in the shower, it&#x27;s time ... S M O O T H.</li>
    <li> Works great, and as advertised it 100% doesn&#x27;t fog when used as instructed.  Solid mounting system stays stuck to the shower wall.</li>
    <li> Still in my shower....there are not a lot of great options for this type of product.....this is the best option...but the adhesive should be able to be removed easier</li>
    <li> This works well.  I have used it for a few weeks now and there has been no fog to speak of on the mirror.  Very easy to mount and easy to fill with water.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mirror with great expectations.  However, what I found is that it is average . . .at best.  the &amp;#34;big secret&amp;#34; is that this mirror has you fill it with hot water prior to your shave.  I waited a few months to write my review to get a good sense of what it actually delivered.  the fact is . . .it is no better than the $10 version you buy at Wal-Mart or Target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first few months it works GREAT! (just like every other shower mirror)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation:  Save your money.  Buy s cheapo.  You get the same results&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is just my observation.  Do what you like.</li>
    <li> Very easy to assemble.  Stays attached to my tile shower without a problem.  The squegee and shelf are a nice touch.  When filled with warm water it will not fog.  At first i thought it would be a hassle to refill it but just pulling it off the wall and filling it up and putting it back takes less than 15 sec.</li>
    <li> I have used shaving mirrors in the homes of people with whom I have stayed, and they were ... OK. That set the bar for this order fairly low so imagine my pleasant surprise when my new product cleared the bar by 200%. I think I did read a negative review or two, but for the life of me I can&#x27;t find those same negatives. I love this thing!</li>
    <li> This is a replacement for at least 3 mirrors that were suppose to fog free. Not so, this is the best in the market, you buy this mirror and you wont have to buy another.</li>
    <li> The mirror works great and is totally fog free.  My only beef is how it&#x27;s installed, adhesive strips and silicone gel.  I hope it isn&#x27;t hard to remove when the time comes.  Would have preferred heavy duty suction cups like my Boon Bath Frog.</li>
    <li> A little annoying to have to fill up the container with hot water in order to make it &#x27;fogless&#x27;, but beyond that, the mirror works great, and its nice to have a little shelf below it.</li>
    <li> This mirror actually changed my life. I refer any guy I know to this product. When I first bought it, I thought it would be one of those gadgets that you are just disappointed with in the end for common reasons such as cheap material that breaks down or something that really makes your life more of a hassle than it already was before. However, this is one product out of dozens I have bought in my life time that actually completely changed my routine and made my life better. I no longer shave in front of the mirror of the bathroom sink, because this makes it so convenient to shave while I&#x27;m showering and it works flawlessly. What this has done is removed the uncomfortableness of getting out of a nice warm shower into the cold, shaving from a mirror that is too far away, and getting shaving cream all over that you have to wipe off instead of rinsing it off instantly under the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How it works:&lt;br /&gt;You take it off the hook, fill it with warm water which takes about 10 seconds, put it back on, and no fog. I bought one for BOTH my bathrooms and one for my dad who also uses it now in his shower. My wife uses it sometimes too when she is removing her mascara in the shower she likes to see if she got all of it off her face. The glue is solid, I have been using it for about 6 months now and there is no sign of this product wearing out or falling apart. One of a kind product. I never rate stuff, but I felt I should for this thing.</li>
    <li> This is the third mirror I&#x27;ve bought from this company- one for each of the three places I&#x27;ve lived in the past 5 years.  They&#x27;ve never failed, never fallen from the shower wall.  If you need a fog less shower mirror look no further than this one.</li>
    <li> I have used several fogless shower mirrors over the years. All have shortcomings. This little item is unique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pocket behind the mirror fills with hot water so that the mirror surface is the same temp as the shower...UNIQUE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attachment method is quite good using both two sided tape and sticking silicone paste. Once it is on the tile wall, it stays put!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 5 stars...well worth the price!</li>
    <li> What a wonderful mirror I bought it for my husband as the suction cups on his old one didnt always work really well. Nothing worse then enjoying a shower and bam hit in the foot by a falling mirror.&lt;br /&gt;Well those days and sore toes are behind me thanks to this mirror. Its secure to the shower wall the light is amazingly bright and its fogless..perfect shower mirror</li>
    <li> The second one I bought is kind of foggy from the start... Still usable but not very clear. So next time buying a different one</li>
    <li> This is the best shaving mirror I have used. It stays on the wall if applied according to the instructions and does not fog. I have tried many others and this is the best.</li>
    <li> My husband needed a new shower mirror so I ordered this one.  He told me that he likes it, so that&#x27;s good enough for me!</li>
    <li> I have had several shower mirrors and this is easily the best one! I would recommend it to anyone who shaves in the shower!</li>
    <li> chose this because I&#x27;ve had a shower mirror before that used running shower water to stay fog free. I was amazed when I used it to find that even once the water you fill the mirror with has become tepid, there is still no fogging. I take long showers and I&#x27;ve yet to see this mirror fog. other benefit is this design means that it&#x27;ll last a long long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that the mirror portion detaches so you can fill it, and the included squeegee works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My gripes are very small, but there are two of them. I would really, really prefer a glass mirror to the plastic one. within a foot, there is no distortion, but two feet away it gets a little funhouse-mirror-ey. it&#x27;s no problem for the user, as when you&#x27;re shaving, you shouldn&#x27;t be that far away from the mirror anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My second gripe is that I wish the squeegee was the exact width of the mirror, not about 80% of it. it&#x27;d be nice to only have to run the squeegee along the mirror once instead of twice. but again, it&#x27;s only a minor quibble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read the instructions and use the silicon adhesive as well as the pads, and this thing is SECURE. I can&#x27;t use suction cups because I have the most microscopically textured tile in my shower, so I am thankful for the design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;all in all, this is the best shower mirror on amazon. if they could fix those two little design quibbles if they ever decide to redesign this thing, I&#x27;d be blown away.</li>
    <li> This works really really well.  I think I am supposed to write more, but it simply works great.  Follow the instruction and it will NOT fog up.  Solid product.</li>
    <li> This is my second shower mirror purchase in two years, first one was different manufacturer and design. It had suction cups, a metal frame and nice mirror. However, the mirror stopped looking so good, would always fog up and the suction cups were temperamental where it would stick and then not stick. Someone stole old trusty while I was on vacation so I needed another mirror and found the Fogless Mirror with Squeegee. So here I open the box and find everything I need to stick it in the shower, complete with clear silcone RTV to glue it on. There are two double back stickems on the back to get it in place and hold it and then the silicone glue cures and gives it the extra strength to hold the mirror on with a small quantity of warm water that you put in which keeps it from fogging up. It works and the mirror is easy to line up and drop into the grooves that hold it. There is an adjustment that allows you to move the mirror up or down; I mounted the mirror at my face level however if someone shorter or taller used the mirror, they could adjust the tilt to suit their height. There is a little shelf under the mirror for the razor; this works great however because I am on a ship and it is rocking and rolling today, the razor fell off but this won&#x27;t happen in a normal home environment unless you are living over a sinkhole and the bottom falls out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been enjoying this mirror for a while but a chronic issue has now come up.&lt;br /&gt;The fogless aspect of the mirror is great and it works - far better (and durably) than any other &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; mirror I&#x27;ve had.&lt;br /&gt;The issue that has developed is with the strength of the &amp;#34;hinge&amp;#34; on which the mirror hangs and allows the vertical height to be adjusted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no instability in the device itself and no concern it will fall, but with a chamber full of water (to create the fogless mirror) the weight of the mirror slowly weakens the plastic hinge such that when it&#x27;s full of water it can only be in the most dependent position and, probably, looking down at your neck or chest.  The only options to deal with this that I&#x27;ve found are to bend down to shave or to put less water into the chamber and try to make the lighter mirror/water combo stay in a useful position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a frustrating problem but I guess not entirely unexpected given the reasonable price of the product.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised!  Very pleased!  My only problem is remembering to empty the water out of the back when finished.</li>
    <li> No shower mirror is going to perfect but this one is pretty close. Let your shower warm up and fill the back up with water to keep it from fogging. That&#x27;s it. Has a little squeegee for taking the water off of the mirror which is a nice touch. I was able to get two for the price of one, bringing it to about $15 a mirror. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d have bought it for the $30 asking price.</li>
    <li> Like many I had been in an endless cycle of replacing other shower mirrors every few months for various reasons.  I bought this on Amazon in 2010 and never had a problem fogging up or falling off the wall; it never really held the position when it was full but I mounted it higher so the forward tilt was always at the right angle so it never mattered.  After focusing on my mug for over 1,000 days it never shattered.  It basically did everything you could possibly ask of it.  I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be looking for a replacement until now - I&#x27;m renovating my bathroom and can&#x27;t get the darn thing off the wall.  While quite sturdy, the only way it&#x27;s coming off my wall is in pieces - concrete was apparently the adhesive of choice in 2010.  That said I will be happily buying another one for the new bathroom and highly recommend this to people considering one.</li>
    <li> A good product.  The only thing I should have considered as an additional option was something with it&#x27;s own lighting.</li>
    <li> We bought this as a wedding gift with a gift card.  I and my husband really like it.  It is expensive but very well worth it.</li>
    <li> Works as described Very happy with it.Has not even thought of fogging up. Just follow instructions and you should like it as much as I do</li>
    <li> This is the one. Love to shave in the shower. Had a round suction cup mirror on the glass side wall of the shower. It was ok. Eventually the mirror deteriorated. I read the reviews and ordered this. Mounted it on an uneven, thin vertical stone tile wall. Holding solidly. The design works perfectly. The mirror is larger, clear and crisp. It looks great on the wall. So far, after a month or so, I would say this is the perfect product for my needs. June 2015 update: it fell off the wall! It did not break. The adhesive (I used both the two-sided tape and the full tube of adhesive that come with the mirror) let go between the mirror back and the adhesive. The adhesive was still on the stone/tile wall. It came off the wall relatively easily. I have reattached it to the wall using weather proof two-sided tape made for outdoor use. So far, so good. Disappointed that it fell off the wall, and that it failed where their adhesive and their product come together. Still worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for father&#x27;s day.  He had an older mirror that hooked into our shower head and was wanting something new.  We installed it before we went on a trip to give it time to dry. He put it a little off from where he should have so I need to try and get some more glue to move it.  Otherwise he says he really likes it.  If you add the water it doesn&#x27;t fog up. The only disadvantage is his other mirror was magnified and this isn&#x27;t but he said it&#x27;s still works well.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this mirror to others.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t buy this mirror years ago...wasted countless years with subpar &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; mirrors that lasted less than a year. Great product, works perfectly.</li>
    <li> This item is exactly as described.  It doesn&#x27;t fog up in the shower and is very well attached to the tile wall.  I would recommend this product.  Shipping was fast also.</li>
    <li> apparently you have to refill it with hot water every time you use it. wasn&#x27;t aware of that, but my boyfriend seems to enjoy it a lot.</li>
    <li> I got thus for my husbands birthday gift! He absolutely LOVES it!! It was easy to mount and is really easy to use! I totally recommend the product!! :)</li>
    <li> I received this mirror after having tried other so called fogless mirrors in the past. Mounting was very easy but I bought some of the 3m removable hanging strips and used them instead of the silicone that came in the package. I have used this mirror for a couple of weeks and am really happy with the product, it works as advertised! fogfree shaving at last.</li>
    <li> I just moved and couldn&#x27;t get this off my shower (I didn&#x27;t try too hard), but I miss it already. I bought a typical fogless mirror and it&#x27;s already getting foggy. This one lasted me years and always worked. I&#x27;ll be picking up another soon.</li>
    <li> I have been using this mirror for several years - and it works very well.  It really doesn&#x27;t fog up.  Like many of the individuals who have written their reviews, after about a year or two - the tilting mechanism stopped working properly - the little plastic teeth of the tilting mechanism couldn&#x27;t hold the mirror at the right angle when full with hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it turned out, I had a very small bottle of pre-shaving oil on the little ledge under the mirror. I placed the bottle BEHIND the lower edge of the mirror. Luckily, the angle of the tilt, with the little bottle behind it was perfect.  The little bottle has its permanent home BEHIND the mirror and props up the mirror to the perfect angle.  I no longer use the pre-shave oil - but I am confident my mirror will go on forever.  I am sure a small plastic pill container would work just as well....</li>
    <li> I have a mirror in every room of my house and now I can claim one in the shower as well.  It is so nice to be me.  Handsome and blemish free, I am the envy of all that gaze upon me.  And now, thanks to Fogless Shower Mirror with Squeegee by ToiletTree Products, I can see me in all my splendor without the hassles of competitive mirrors (do they REALLY compete?) fogging or falling off my shower walls.  I am going to order three more so I do not miss a moment of ME whichever way I turn in my shower.  I feel bad for you, because you are NOT ME!</li>
    <li> I bought it for my father who lives in Florida. He was complaining that his old mirror fell. So I purchased this one for him and had it shipped to him as a gift. He is absolutely in love with it, stating \\&quot;It actually works!\\&quot;. After a recent visit where I used it myself several times, I am buying another. Great product! So easy to install that even my dad could do it!</li>
    <li> If I had a nickle for every shower mirror I&#x27;ve ever bought, I would probably be on a beach in Tahiti instead of sitting here at work writing this review (it&#x27;s a slow night).  This product wins as the best one I&#x27;ve used.  It has two major plusses going for it:  1) it STAYS ON THE WALL and doesn&#x27;t fall off, and 2) it DOESN&#x27;T FOG UP.      I was going to give this review 4 stars because I find the squeegee that it comes with pretty weak when it comes to removing the water droplets, but I decided to go with the 5 stars instead because none of the other shower mirrors even come with a squeegee and this one truly does not fog up or fall off the wall - I&#x27;ve had it almost two months now.  I&#x27;ve never had one that didn&#x27;t start fogging up after the 3rd week and the only other one I had that didn&#x27;t fall off the wall was hanging by a cord (from a nail I pounded in the wall above the shower wall because I couldn&#x27;t stand getting woke up in the middle of the night by the thing crashing at the bottom of my bathtub - it worked, but it made my bathroom look like tin pan alley).      My recommendation to the manufacturer would be to make a higher end model with a light built in both sides (note:  the light would be on both sides as opposed to just having one light at the top -- when you&#x27;re shaving, light falls right behind hot water and a sharp blade in order of importance).  The light in my bathroom is above the sink, not on the ceiling, so I can only use this mirror to shave when it&#x27;s light outside.  Problem is, I&#x27;ve yet to find a shower mirror with a light that actually works for more than a few months without going dead completely or turning into a disco light, so unless the manufacturer can make a lighted one that works, they may not want to ruin their record because, right now, they are batting 100% as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  Excellent product - thank you.</li>
    <li> When you read the instructions on having to wait 24 hours for the silicon to dry and then filling the container with shower water and finally using the squeegee to clean the mirror, you can&#x27;t help but to think \\&quot;Do I really need to be going through all this effort for a fog free shave?\\&quot;.    The answer is.. ABSOLUTELY.  The truth is this thing is designed perfectly.  You hop in the shower, you hold the removable mirror under the shower water for a few seconds to fill the reservoir behind the mirror, you put the mirror back, grab the squeegee and clean it off one time.  That&#x27;s it.. done.  Takes no more than 10 seconds and you literally get a fog free mirror for the entire shower.    No more throwing water at the mirror to get a clean view of your face.    Simply an amazing product.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1KANRIQNDPA13]]I am very excited to share with you about the Fogless Mirror by ToiletTree Products. This mirror claims it will not fog over during your shower and I couldn&#x27;t wait to see this for myself.    First is the installation. You need to clean the spot you want to hang it at and let it dry, once dry clean it with rubbing alcohol and let it dry. After it is dry you are ready to hang your mirror. They use a combo of adhesive tape and silicone glue. It then needs to set for 24 hours. After that you are ready to go. It was very simple to install.    Next is testing it. I took a shower and I have to say I want to call this the miracle mirror. It never did fog up AND the mirror magnifies making it nice to use tweezers and wash my face. After coming out of the shower I had to laugh at my \\&quot;regular\\&quot; mirror and how fogged over it was.     If you like to shave in the shower, brush your teeth, tweeze, ect... This mirror is for you. I LOVE it and actually can&#x27;t wait to take another shower, lol.  ----------------------------  I received a free mirror to review. This is my honest opinion and I was not compensated for writing it.</li>
    <li> I love this fogless mirror I&#x27;ve had many over the years and this one is the best I just ordered a second one for my boat and I&#x27;m sure I will order some more for freinds. I would highly recommend this product...</li>
    <li> Got this mirror a couple of days ago and attached it to the wall in my shower. Uses adhesive tape and silicon gel to stick to the wall. Once on and dry, this thing ain&#x27;t coming off without a claw hammer or something. No worries about it falling in the middle of the night like those suction cups.    To keep it fog free you just put hot water in it from the shower. I keep a cup in the shower for this. Has a little platform for your razor.    Only 2 things I would change, but these don&#x27;t really detract from the rating.  1) Have a small hole in the bottom of the resevoir for the water to drip out. This would keep you from having to take the mirror off the bracket to dump the water  2)The little razor platform should have an indention or something so the razor doesn&#x27;t fall off if you bump it will showering.    Great product.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s not much to write about. This product works. I&#x27;m giving it 4.5 stars, because I don&#x27;t like the idea of filing-up the mirror with warm/hot water. In any case, this is a solid purchase.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this to shave in the shower everyday and it hasn&#x27;t fogged yet!  The little shelf is great for storing his razor.</li>
    <li> I got this mirror for my husband, and we have both been amazed by how well it works.  His shaving time has been much lower, and his shave a lot better.  The mirror really doesn&#x27;t fog up!    His only complaint is that sometimes the mirror gets water spots on it, and the squeegee isn&#x27;t the best, but it&#x27;s really not a big deal at all.  It&#x27;s a definite must buy for any man in your life!</li>
    <li> There are so many reason to love the Fogless Shower Mirror though one big one is shaving in the shower. This will allow you to see your every move preventing missing spots and cuts. We are happy to have this and plan to purchase a few for gifts.</li>
    <li> After trying a few different mirrors over the years that made the very same \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; claim, we gave up on these types of mirrors for the showers, figuring it was hopeless. This one works! This patent-pending mirror has a reservoir that you fill with hot shower water when you&#x27;re ready to use it. This is key in neutralizing the steam in the air when you&#x27;re showering to provide a truly fogless mirror.     This mirror is also a time-saver for my husband before he leaves for work in the morning, and it&#x27;s a great tool for me when I have to remove makeup. I can&#x27;t even count the number of times I washed my face in the shower, only to do it again when I got out because I hadn&#x27;t removed all of the mascara from under my eyes. I&#x27;m so glad we finally found our fogless shower mirror thanks to Toilet Tree Products!</li>
    <li> The reservoir in the back for water really helps to keep the mirror regulated to avoid fogging, it&#x27;s honestly a simple design that just makes sense. I have used it to remove my make&#x27;up and use my steam activated cleanser on my face to make sure I hit all the right spots and hubby has used it to shave both his head and face (i love &#x60;em bald!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was easy to install with double sided tape and silicon adhesive, i added those to the back of it and just stuck it up on the wall where I wanted it and that was it! The mirror itself is easy to detach to fill the reservoir with water to help prevent the fogging and the shelf is awesome to keep his razor on and out of the bathtub and off my shelf. I even love the squeegee that comes with it for easy clean off on the mirror if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all hubby and I both were/are very satisfied with the mirror and I am ecstatic that I finally have one that honestly does not fog up in the middle of use!</li>
    <li> My husband and I have tried countless shower mirrors over the last ten years -- he uses one for shaving, I use one for eyebrow plucking and shaping. We must have dropped two hundred dollars, easily, on numerous mirrors, only to have each one immediately or eventually fog up during use. I finally decided to give the Fogless Shower Mirror a whirl, because one thing set it apart from the rest -- the built-in reservoir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And what do you know? It WORKS. We have had our Fogless Shower Mirror since August, and so long as we fill up the built-in reservoir with warm water, there is no clouding or fogging to speak of. The included squeegee is handy for removing water droplets as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a Fogless Shower Mirror that actually *delivers* on its promise not to fog, this is a product I would definitely recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(And as an added bonus, the mirror comes with two types of adhesive -- the standard adhesive foam pads *and* silicone adhesive, and together they have our mirror staying right where we put it!)</li>
    <li> 3+ months of shaving and still no fog.</li>
    <li> Great! No fog, and easy set up! My husband had a different one before this and it would fog, but this one is crystal clear!</li>
    <li> Works exactly as it should.  Thank you</li>
    <li> My wife got this for me on my birthday back in March and I&#x27;ve been using it daily ever since. This is something any man cannot be without if shaving is a daily chore. I use it while in the shower and can be mounted to the wall with the provided tube of silicone. Some people say that the silicone won&#x27;t slick to the wall, not a problem for me! Just make sure the area you&#x27;re using is completely dry and use the entire tube. I fill the reservoir with hot hot water and there are no signs of leakage and its been 5 months of daily use. This is a very well made product that every man needs! It&#x27;s a great gift any guy will enjoy for a long time. So guys, tell your woman to get one for you and you be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband, he liked it so well that i had to get him another one for out RV.</li>
    <li> This was a gift. It arrived very promptly and he loves it. If he can use it, anyone can. Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> My husband wanted a shower mirror, and after reading reviews decided on this one. Although the mirror is not glass (as implied in the product photo) the silver coating of the mirror surface provided a pretty good image. The silicone used for mounting the mirror is still secure after almost a year and half of use. However, after a little less than a year, the coating started to come off.  It is now unusable. It is very disappointing, because it worked well and never fogged. It just didn&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described, easy to set up, clear instructions.  My husband loves this - much better than any other shower mirror he has used.  Money well spend.  Highly recommend this product and seller.</li>
    <li> I like it.  I truly do.</li>
    <li> I like the size of the mirror but I dont want to hang it on my wall in my shower. Once filled with water in the back it tips over very easy so I end up holding this big mirror in my hand. Its a bit to big to hold for someone with small hands if you end up doing it that way. If mounted to the wall I am not sure how you fill the back with water each time but havent really looked into it. The hot water helps it not to fog up but there still is some fog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The squeege is tiny and dosent do a great job.</li>
    <li> Great for shaving and has not gotten gross looking after many months of use.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t work. Waist of money.</li>
    <li> The mirror is perfect for female or male.  Whether removing mascara or shaving it is a 5 star fogless mirror.  I would definitely purchase this again for my dad or father in law.</li>
    <li> Very pleased. Install was simple and it works great.</li>
    <li> Product is as claims. Mirror doesn&#x27;t fog up and is real mirror. Squeegee works too!</li>
    <li> I have used this mirror for several years and just bought a second one for our vacation home.  I have bought two or three other types of shower mirrors in the past and they either started fogging or just broke within a year or two. This mirror is absolutely fog free when filled with hot water and has lasted for years.  I can get a smooth close shave and leave all the water in the shower instead of around the sink!</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it says it does, and is easy to assemble and use. Would be nice if there were a freestanding version.</li>
    <li> This fog free mirror is the greatest invention since sliced bread! I have been shaving in the shower for several decades, but the shower mirrors have always fogged up, deteriorated, and even fallen off. Not this one! After using this Toilet Tree product for thirty days, I have thus far purchased two additional mirrors as gifts to friends -- male friends, of course!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Les Breitman, M.D.</li>
    <li> Works well!  Easy set up and it fits securely on the wall, compared to my previous suction-cup mirror.  Put it up without water just to see and it fogs up...then filled it with water and the fog immediately disappears!  It stayed defogged the entire shower.  The squeegee is a plus as well.  At first I thought it was gimmicky, but then after a few uses it definitely works better than my soapy hand!  Well done, excellent product and I definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> The Mirror is really good as i gifted this to my husband he liked it as he wanted one .</li>
    <li> Truly fogless. Simple and elegant design. No chemicals required to keep mirror fogless, works beautifully with warm water.&lt;br /&gt;Held onto tiled wall with supplied caulk removing inevitable annoying falls as with suction cup products.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product. It is very well thought out and designed. I would recommend the led version of this product.</li>
    <li> The first mirror that I have bought that actually works!!!</li>
    <li> It really does work - the mirror doesn&#x27;t fog.  However, you must add hot water to  it each time you shower, which my husband thought would be a nuisance at first.  Now, he doesn&#x27;t mind since it works so well.</li>
    <li> I have bought and tried about 20 anti-fog shower mirrors in my lifetime.  This one is the best.  If you follow the directions, it stays up on the tile shower wall.  The reflective surface remaims fog free and doesn&#x27;t fade.  A+</li>
    <li> This item performs exactly as advertised: no fog. The only drawback was that I did not want to stick it to my shower tile by using the silicone adhesive. As far as I know, nothing will completely remove silicone residue should you want to remove the mirror for some reason; especially on rough ceramic tile. I overcame this by purchasing a 1/8&amp;#34; thick, 10x12&amp;#34; piece of Lexan (plexiglass) from Home Depot (Lowes also has it), and a small coat rack hook with two hooks and double screw holes in the shank. I mounted the coat hook to the top of the Lexan upside down by marking the hole placement and drilling two1/8&amp;#34; holes. Used two small bolts with flat nuts to secure it in place. I hung this over the top my shower door, placed the mirror against the Lexan, and marked the top and bottom position to the height of my face. A black Sharpie marker works well. All you have to do then is lay the Lexan on a flat surface and mount the mirror to it per instructions. Since Lexan is a smooth surface product, you will have to rough it up a little with sandpaper where you are going to apply the silicone or it will not stick well. Now, when I want to shave, I just hook the assembly over my shower door and go to work. Filling the water holder is a snap by just holding it under the shower stream. When not in use, I keep it hung from by shower caddy. If anyone is really interested in this technique, I will post a photo on this review.</li>
    <li> For the last 15-20 years,I have used a fogless mirror that connects to the water outlet and shower head to mirror. After twice trying to repair and having product replaced I gave up and thought this product sounded like a good alternative. After using for about a week, I am very pleased with the Fogless  Shower Mirror by ToiletTree.  Bought my second mirror for my second house. Installation has improved greatly with water resistant double-sided tape instead of silicone sealant. However instructions could suggest experimenting with location before final install because that double-sided tape is very close to permanent install and very difficult to relocate if you don&#x27;t like the first location.</li>
    <li> This mirror is acceptable at best. I previously had a 2-sided(1X-3X) mirror that I really liked, but I am unable to purchase it after having to replace the original mirror after 8+ years of use! Pain-in-the-butt to have to fill &amp; empty it each use &amp; would prefer to have a 3X or 5X mirror, rather than 1X!</li>
    <li> EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED</li>
    <li> Best no fog mirror on the market!</li>
    <li> My husband says that it&#x27;s the best shower mirror on the market!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for an ex boyfriend a few years ago and he loved this mirror!! He used it everyday to shave in the shower. It somehow got broke when he moved and he was pretty bummed he wasn&#x27;t able to use it anymore. He talked about how awesome the fogless mirror was all the time!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this mirror.  It stuck great to our shower tile that isn&#x27;t smooth, unlike suction cups.  I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> The biggest surprise to me about this mirror was how it works.  To keep it fogless, you fill the back of it with hot shower water, and it keeps the temperature difference between the mirror and the shower air at a minimum.  It&#x27;s simple but ingenious, and it works perfectly.  No fog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend you follow the instructions carefully.  There is some important information in them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* Lots of nice little touches.  The mirror angle can adjust to one of several pre-set angles, up and down.  The mounting is solid as a rock once you get it up (at least, so far).  The tray included for your razor is a nice touch, and works well.  Comes with a little squeegee for the mirror, which conveniently slides into storage under the razor tray.&lt;br /&gt;* Stays perfectly fogless.  What more can I say?&lt;br /&gt;* Mirror, while not being an actual glass mirror, works very well.&lt;br /&gt;* Instructions were very clear and simple to follow.  While it takes several steps, installation is very easy.&lt;br /&gt;* Great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* Squeegee could use a little work.  It&#x27;s tricky to wipe the mirror of water perfectly after you&#x27;re done, because there&#x27;s not really a good place to grip it.  I wish ToiletTree would place a handle on the squeegee.  That would help a lot.&lt;br /&gt;* You must wait one day for the silicon adhesive to set.  It&#x27;s not a HUGE deal, but it would have been nice to be able to use it right after installation.  Maybe they could experiment with just using 3M water-resistant Command adhesive strips, instead of the current silicon way, and see if that would work as well.&lt;br /&gt;* The mirror picture bends EVER so slightly.  It&#x27;s not anything that actually matters much.  It&#x27;s just a slight cosmetic annoyance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, though, an excellent mirror for the money.  I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my fiance and it is a good size. It also stays fog-less! However, because you have to use double sided tape to attach it in the shower, my fiance opted not to put it in the shower as to not risk leaving any marks on a rented apartment. So, while it does help, it limits what you can do with it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a simple idea: there&#x27;s a reservoir behind the mirror that you simply fill with warm shower water and that completely prevents the mirror from fogging. The mirror mounts easily to the wall, includes a squeegee and, best of all, never fails, making shaving in the shower a total breeze. I have bought several of these for different bathrooms in my house and they all work flawlessly. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband and he refused to use it, says the adhesive used to glue it to the tile will be nearly impossible to remove. Sadly it&#x27;s been in the closet for almost 2 years.</li>
    <li> This is my second shower mirror from Toilet Tree Products.  When new, they are great.  After a year or so, they remain fogless, but the mirror &amp;#34;coating&amp;#34; fails and the mirror becomes worthless.  I did just replace my failed mirror with a new one because I&#x27;m not aware of a better shower mirror.  Like the last one, I expect this new mirror will last about a year before the reflected image gets so bad I&#x27;m forced to throw it out.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s honest for ToiletTree to guarantee this product not to fog when they very well know the mirror will itself will deteriorate before losing it&#x27;s fogless quality.</li>
    <li> Works as well as I could imagine. I&#x27;m pretty optimistic that it won&#x27;t get worse over time (like many fogless mirrors) because it&#x27;s using hot water instead of an anti-fog film. A brilliant use of basic science.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The squeegee also works great, better than I hoped.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other shower mirrors and this is the only one that doesn&#x27;t fog and is clear enough to see my face for shaving.</li>
    <li> I very much like using this &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; shaving mirror. However, to make it &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; requires filling it with hot water every time it is used. Not a big deal, but filling and emptying the chamber behind the mirror was not, as I recall, part of the original promotional description. To be fair to purchasers, I suggest that this be made more clear up front.</li>
    <li> After following the installation instructions, I now have a truly fogless mirror in my shower, which is exactly what I wanted. Seems to be holding up well so far. I use the squeegee and everything works out fine. The material is plastic, which feels cheap, but that&#x27;s what you get for the price; and it also helps with durability, I suppose.</li>
    <li> We just moved to a new home and somehow this got lost... what a bummer. So I am quickly ordering a replacment as the show just isn&#x27;t complete without this. The one change I did make was that the original had the LEDs but I found that we never used them, and even when turned on they were odd color and not very bright, almost useless. This time I&#x27;m getting the non-LED version and saving a few bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each time I shower, I pull the mirror off and dump the old water, then I wold it under the warm water to refill. Then I return it to the holder and use the squeegee to clean the mirror. It is then perfect for shaving.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Great product</li>
    <li> The fog-free aspect works, but the weight of the entire product is too heavy to be held up by the silicone and sticky backing. The mirror fell after a mere 10 months of steady use. Since the silicone is a one time use product, it cannot be reattached.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there was an option for suction cups, then maybe the product can be improved in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go with a standard suction cup style mirror, that way you can move it around your shower as you see fit, and in the event that it falls, it can be easily reattached.</li>
    <li> Easy to mount on shower wall.  Works perfectly.  Would recommend product and seller!</li>
    <li> Ordered this based on the reviews here. Installed it applying every last drop of the silicon tube that was provided and let it dry for 48 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the first use the back plate separated from the silicon leaving me a mess to deal with on my shower wall and an unmounted mirror.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t come with the silicon adhesive to stick the mirror to the shower, so it basically does not work.</li>
    <li> As expected.  Very nice.  Works very well.</li>
    <li> This was purchased so I can hopefully save time by shaving in the shower instead of at the sink.  Installation instructions were simple and clear, and it took less than 3 minutes to have it installed in the shower.  Follow the instructions and it will work as advertised.  Very solid purchase!</li>
    <li> My husband is addicted to shaving in the shower after a decade with a water-circulation fog-free mirror, so we had to look for a replacement when it started leaking last month.  We found, though, that anything in the same style (i.e. - connected to the water source) was now made in plastic, and seemed not well made.  So we decided to purchase this item based on the many positive reviews, and we&#x27;re not at all disappointed.  As a matter of fact, we love this one more, since he no longer has to face into the shower spray to shave - we placed this mirror in a more comfortable location away from the spray.    For those unclear on the operation, you secure the mounting to the wall of your shower (with a combination of provided silicon gel and sticky tapes), and the mirror slides in and out of the base.  The back of the mirror is designed to be a water reservoir, which you fill with hot water at the beginning of your shower (or at whatever time in your shower you are ready to use the mirror).     It stays perfectly fog-free and the included squeegee is a brilliant idea, since it lets you clear off not only the water that splashes when you fill the reservoir, but any other water that lands on the mirror during your shower.    The product is wonderful - secure on the wall and easy to use with wet hands.  (My husband is also enjoying the shelf for his razor).   I&#x27;m considering buying a second one for our guest bathroom.  The only problem we&#x27;ve had is that it takes 24 hours for the silicon gel to dry when you mount the base to the wall of your shower - since my husband and I shower at different times of the day, we had to rearrange our shower schedule for one day to make sure we had the necessary 24 hours.  But it was completely worth the wait :D</li>
    <li> I have never had a fog-free shower mirror that actually worked well until I bought this one.  Since all of my shower walls are glass tiles in a horizontal mosaic pattern, suction cups won&#x27;t work, this mirror was easy to hang securely using the silicone included with it.  It only takes a few seconds to fill up the water reservoir, and the mirror doesn&#x27;t fog at all for the duration of the shower.  Plus, it looks pretty good in there too.</li>
    <li> This mirror had great reviews so I purchased it.   We rely on these reviews because they are usually so accurate and give us great feedback on making a product decision.   In this case, however, it failed us.   The reviews were great for this mirror so I purchased with confidence.   The mirror and structure is made with very thin lightweight plastic.   it installed no problem.   The problem came on first use.    When you fill the reservoir with the warm water from the shower, the thin mirror warps outward and when you look in the mirror, your face is distorted.   Dump the water out and your face looks normal again.   Imagine putting water in a baggie how it bulges outward, well it isn&#x27;t that bad but it&#x27;s definitely noticable.   You can put your finger on the mirror and push it back and watch your face distort like a carnival mirror.    It&#x27;s already afixed it to the wall so I won&#x27;t return it.   The mirror does stay fog clear and you can shave with it, I&#x27;d just expect the mirror to be able to withstand 6 inches of water behind it without distorting.</li>
    <li> The brand name is a poor pun - Toilet Tree / toiletry - [sigh] - but everything else about this mirror is great. It will hold firmly to the shower wall, it absolutely will not fog, and it has a small squeegee to keep it clean. If you shave in the shower, buy this mirror. You can&#x27;t buy anything comparable in the stores</li>
    <li> I originally set out to find a lighted shaving mirror for my husband but the reviews of the lighted models were so, \\&quot;iffy,\\&quot; I decided to pick this mirror and just upgrade the lighting in his bathroom. Good decision. This mirror works exactly as advertised and the new, better lighting in the bathroom is a bonus for both of us. Thanks, Amazon for posting product reviews so that I am forced to think outside the box sometimes!</li>
    <li> So, take note that the only way to mount this mirror is to GLUE the mounting bracket to the wall. There is no option to suction cup it.</li>
    <li> With a new house, I wanted to get a fog-less mirror. However, I didn&#x27;t want to drill holes for electricity or mounting a mirror. Plus they tended to be expensive.    Looking at the reviews, I thought I&#x27;d give this one a shot. Glad I did: the mirror works perfectly! Mounted with silicon, the bracket has firmly adhered to the tile. The mirror itself stays fog free through the entire shower by simply putting in hot shower water. When done, dump it out. There&#x27;s even a nice tray for the squeegee and a razor.    Shaving has never been better. My face and I are quite happy.    Yeah; this sounds like marketing speak, but this one really earns the kudos.</li>
    <li> After my husband got hooked on shaving in the shower with his last mirror. All he wanted for Christmas was a new shower...and a Tundra Truck but because of budget, I went for the mirror.  He LOVES this mirror.  Even though he hated waiting the 24 hours before you install it, I can say it was worth it.  Every morning he says how much better this mirror is prior to others.    A great buy if you have are in need of a shower mirror.  Now to find a Tundra....</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband because he was using this little tiny mirror in the shower to shave, and I don&#x27;t know how he was doing it. He did all of the set up because I didn&#x27;t know where he wanted it positioned. The first time he used it he came out raving about how it really did work! It&#x27;s been months now and he&#x27;s still talking about how awesome the Fogless Shower Mirror is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it out too to make sure it actually worked cause I was skeptical. It&#x27;s easy just put hot water into the pocket behind the mirror. And yep it does stay fogless! The warm water behind the mirror keeps it so that it won&#x27;t fog up! I am really impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would be a great gift for anyone in your life that uses a mirror in the shower! I know my husband is happy to get one.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband and he loves it.  He only shaves in the shower now.  The installation was quick and easy and the mirror is really fog proof when you follow the directions and add water to the back of the mirror.  We have had no problems with it at all - I was afraid it would not stay on the tiles.  The company was easy to deal with and had good email communication and fast delivery.  All in all, a most delightful experience!</li>
    <li> This mirror is seriously amazing!  It truly is fogless and is worth every penny (I was reluctant to spend so much on a mirror).  Anyone who shaves in the shower has to have one.</li>
    <li> The glue was hard as a rock.  The sticky tape didn&#x27;t hold it up.  It all came crashing down after a couple of days.  The concept of filling the container up with warm water sounds ok, but it doesn&#x27;t fit back on the bracket so easily.  In summary, I trashed it after a few days of trying it, and I chalked it up as another worthless cheap shower mirror (yes, I&#x27;ve tried a bunch, and they all are terrible products).</li>
    <li> I found this product to work as advertised.  Absolutely no fog.  However, the squeegee is not enough to take off all the water on the face of the mirror.  I like others have hard water out of my tap.  Should I leave any water marks on the face of the mirror, calcium buildup will occur.  This is simply the nature of hard water, not the fault of the mirror.  I have learned to squeegee the mirror and then to wipe all water from the face of the mirror and bezel to insure no water spots.  Further, no warpage of the image!</li>
    <li> i bought this mirror after reading all the other reviews and i am glad i did. it was a gift for my husband and he loves it. i also do enjoy that it is adjustable so i am able to use it as well.</li>
    <li> This is the first shower mirror I&#x27;ve purchase. I believe I chose wisely. The mounting instructions and included silicone sealant worked perfectly. (Don&#x27;t forget to clean the shower wall well so the adhesive will stick properly. Glue doesn&#x27;t like soap film.)    The tank design is excellent. Fill with hot water from the shower and the mirror stays absolutely fog free. The attached squeegee is also very good for clearing the droplets on the mirror surface. The razor tray is good sized for even my oversized razor. (My head blade won&#x27;t fit along with the razor, but that&#x27;s not a big deal.)    Been using it about a month so far and it still looks perfect. I&#x27;m expecting a long life.</li>
    <li> This works great as a fog free.   Fill it up with hot water, and it never fogs up.   Been using it for about a month.   Very happy with it.  It is a bit of a hassel filling it up for every shower, but the mounting system alows for a quick fill-up.    Although a little more complicated installation than the suction cup models, it is relatively easy to install and stays put once you install it via the included silcone tube.   My older suction cup mount usually fell off about 3 am .....sounding like someone broke into the house.    Huge improvement over the old ones.    I have had several fog free mirrors, that are plastic mirrors with a surface treatment.   Those don&#x27;t work well at all, and eventually they stop working.   This one works great!</li>
    <li> This mirror DOES NOT fog. It is awesome! It is easy to install, and easy to use. It stays put on the wall, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it crashing down. The mirror is adjustable so everyone can use it. The shelf is nice, and I like that it is shatter proof and rust proof. Great mirror all around!</li>
    <li> This is the first fog free mirror that I&#x27;ve tried that stays fog free through the entire shower.  It&#x27;s a simple concept in that the warm water that you put in the reservoir keeps the temperature of the mirror warm enough to keep fog from forming.  If I would make any changes, I would like a place to hang my razor.  You can see in the picture that there is a ledge, but not a hook.  It&#x27;s not a reason to take off on the rating, but would be a welcome addition.</li>
    <li> Been using the mirror for a few months now and overall it gets the job done. Doesn&#x27;t fog over, was easy to install and works great. However removing the mirror and fill with hot water can be a pain because it&#x27;s hard to line up the mirror to slide into the base. The only other thing is that I wished it was adjustable left to right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - After about 10 months, the gear that holds the mirror in place has striped out and there is distortion in the mirror.</li>
    <li> This is the only shaving mirror I&#x27;ve ever had that really works.  I have a tile shower stall and I was a little concerned that the mirror wouldn&#x27;t stay attached to the wall but I&#x27;ve had no problems whatsoever.  The warm water keeps the mirror fog free and once or twice a week I wipe it off with a towel and it&#x27;s like new.  Very happy.</li>
    <li> This product works exactly as advertised.  It is very easy to attach (all you have to do is to closely follow the instructions).  It stays fogless through an ingenious system -- all you have to do is to fill the back of the mirror with warm or hot water, which takes only a few seconds.</li>
    <li> I have purchased 7-8 \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; mirrors over the last decade, each one gradually worsening after 1 month of use.  I resorted to shaving \\&quot;by feel\\&quot; for about 2 years, knowing that I was throwing money away by purchasing these worthless products.    Then, I found ToiletTree.  It works as advertised.  I have it mounted in the shower, and every morning, I slide the mirror of the mount, fill it with warm water from the shower (takes 5 seconds), and we&#x27;re off.  I am near sighted, and the ability to get close to the mirror to see means know more \\&quot;misses.\\&quot;  I can&#x27;t remember the last time I was this satisfied with a purchase (I don&#x27;t write many reviews, but felt compelled to write one after 6 months of consistently fantastic performance).  Well done, ToiletTree!</li>
    <li> First, my order arrived ahead of schedule! Second,I&#x27;ve been using this mirror for over a month now. Can honestly say this is the best fog free mirror I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve been thru several, trust me! No chemicals! No special treatment of any kind. At first, I thought it would be hassle to refill the well every time, but really, it&#x27;s no big deal. And I&#x27;m lazy. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I know that the best place to shave is the shower, so naturally I wanted to get one of these mirrors. I tried 2 different ones before that either came off or became to spotty and stopped working effectively. I finally got this one and it was worth every penny. Works like a charm! Easy to use and install...</li>
    <li> Fogless is NOT the appropriate word. It fogs up repeatedly. I replaced one that was not advertised as &#x27;fogless&#x27; with this one, but it fogs up all the time.</li>
    <li> I replaced my old \\&quot;fog free\\&quot; (at best it was fog free for six months) mirror with the toilet tree a month ago and am very pleased. This one works and it appears it will stay fog free forever. I went to lowe&#x27;s and purchased a stick up led light (utilitech 0331497) so now I can see clearly when shaving in the shower. I&#x27;m buying this combination as a gift for all my friends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about a month and have zero complaints. Works exactly as described and I&#x27;d certainly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a christmas for my uncle, I hope he will like it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had it for 1 week and I think it is awesome.  100% fogless as advertised!  I can see myself crystal clear in this mirror.  It works perfectly for shaving!  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this mirror!  It is very well attached to my shower tiles.  I don&#x27;t think it is likely to fall off for years and years.</li>
    <li> After reading the other reviews, I decided to give this product a try. It definitely has lived up to it&#x27;s guarantee. Simple to install and use, I would definitely recommend it. In fact, I intend to buy a second one.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. The fogless solution is simple yet ingenious. I have a Philips Norelco Sensotouch Wet/Dry Electric Razor that I love using wet in the shower. This mirror really makes it possible to shave in the shower so quickly and easily.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this everyday and, although, we have only had it for a couple of months, it has been working very well and never steams up. We are ready to attach it to the shower wall now that we know how well it works.</li>
    <li> I have a Toilettree Fogless Shower Mirror and I have been so impressed by it. I love that it attaches with silicone so that I don&#x27;t damage my shower wall attaching it but it still stays up no matter what. Filling the back reservoir with hot water to prevent fogging is simple physics, yet so ingenious! It works great and the mirror stays crystal clear through the entire shower. A great bathroom accessory that we use every day.</li>
    <li> I have tried other mirrors over the years and they ALL will fog up. But so far not this one. its great and when water splashes up on the mirrow I just use the squeegee it off. I wish I did not have to always remove it to dump the water. I wish there was a button at the bottom to push and release the water but I can live with this small problems since the mirror is trully fogless.      updated July 19, 2011- I have had this mirror for a couple of months and still works great. This sounds lazy but I do get tired of always removing the mirror to drain the water but as I said before I can live with it. I do wish it had a LED light because it could be hard to see when water splashes on it.</li>
    <li> Great mirror, all you have to do is fill it up with warm water from the tower &amp; a clear mirror to shave with all shower long.   So good I&#x27;m getting another.</li>
    <li> I bought three different shower mirrors in the last few years and this is the best product. it is clear, easy to install, and i had no issue with the glue. It is perfect for shaving in the shower.</li>
    <li> Bought this item for my husband.  It was easy to install and he really enjoys using it.  It&#x27;s extra nice in that it is unbreakable.</li>
    <li> [...]    This product definitely lives up to its billing.  It is fog free, stays put on the shower wall and allows me to get a good close shave in the shower!  Thanks ToiletTree for making a great product!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend so he could shave in the shower! He used it once and loved it. He said it didn&#x27;t fog at all. Unfortunately, about and hour later it fell off the wall and shattered. So much for \\&quot;designed not to fall\\&quot;...</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic item for a fraction of what it&#x27;s worth. To be honest, I don&#x27;t know if the material is good or bad or what, but I can say that I owned one of these bad boys for over a year and, upon leaving it in another state, bought a new one a few weeks ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This changes your entire daily routine. Forget about shaving in front of the mirror with the hassles that accompany that. This lets you shave in the shower, and then dunk your entire head under the stream and wash your face. In the warm water, shaving is very smooth and easy on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is really a great thing to have.</li>
    <li> My husband used to hate shaving.  Now he never complains.  It hangs in the shower easily.  Fogless works if you follow instructions.  He loves it!</li>
    <li> Scam product! Don&#x27;t believe the hundreds of reviews. It fogs up and is a cheap POS.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for the price. Install was easy and it does a great job assisting you in taking care of your hygiene needs in one place.</li>
    <li> Purchased this as a Father&#x27;s Day gift for my husband and it was a hit!  The mirror does not fog and it was easy to put up in the shower.  My only complaint is that if you try to adjust the mirror, it comes off of the stand.  After a few times, the pegs broke off and it was no longer useable.  We have a small shower so it stuck out a bit farther than I would have liked but if you have a large shower it will be perfect!</li>
    <li> Best shower mirror I&#x27;ve ever bought. This is actually the third time I purchased one. The first broke when moving the second I have as a gift to my brother and the third was to replace the first. This product works amazingly.</li>
    <li> Works for the purpose intended.  Just think very carefully about where you want to mount it because it is not something you can move around after it is mounted.</li>
    <li> For every I use to by the cheap Wal-Mart brands which lasted no time before it started to fog over. I&#x27;ve had this for over a rear now and it hasn&#x27;t failed me yet. Just fill it with warm water, shave, dump the water and your good to go. No fog no mess.</li>
    <li> The double stick tape and glue does not stick to the tile in the shower.  I followed the directions and let it set over night.  It feel off the next day less than 2 minutes after putting water in it.</li>
    <li> I was leery about any shower mirror, however, I&#x27;m very happy with this item.  it is simple to use, just fill it fro the shower, the mirror is large enough and the mounting was simple and holds well.  Ive been using this mirror for about a month now and it works as advertised.  The only improvement I would make is led lighting.  shaves in the shower are so much closer than i had imagined.</li>
    <li> works great in the shower.</li>
    <li> I use this mirror daily to shave with while in the shower. I&#x27;ve had no issues with this one, however while trying to clean soap buildup off of my last one, I scratched the mirror surface so badly it needed to be replaced. So minus one star for durability/scratch resistance of the surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last one was the lighted version of this product, and while I only occasionally used the light, when I need to replace this mirror I&#x27;ll go back to the lighted version.</li>
    <li> This mirror works exactly as described.  The silicon adhesive holds it rock solid.  Easy to slip off the mirror and fill or empty the water that keeps it from fogging up.  The little squeegee is nice but a bit cheap.  It does the job.  For the price, this is a great deal.</li>
    <li> Great shower mirror. It works great, just put hot water in the back and it will stay fog free while showering and shaving</li>
    <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve had one for many years, and it held up well until the day that I moved.</li>
    <li> what a great product. good price too. i use this in my shower. instructions were perfect. works awesome. no issues at all. i love the bracket on which you can put your razor. awesome product. so helpful.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I wanted for a shower mirror. None of that fake “doesn’t fog” material. You just need to keep the mirror at the same temperature as the shower water and you’re golden.</li>
    <li> Very pleased, it really works, would have been more pleased if I didn&#x27;t have to use silicone to glue it to the shower wall.</li>
    <li> Buy it...works perfectly.  I feel a little vain using this, But omg, I love it.  if you follow the instructions, it really does remain steam free.  And it&#x27;s fun to look at yourself while you shower.  :)</li>
    <li> I bought this shower mirror over a year ago for shaving in the shower and it still works great so I thought I should give it a good review. It was pretty easy to install and it is still on the tiled wall after a year. It is very simple to use. Just fill up the back of the mirror during your shower and shave away and it doesn&#x27;t fog up. And the squeegee works great to wipe off any drops of water from the shower that may get on the mirror. So overall it has lasted well it works great.</li>
    <li> This mirror works perfectly.  Easy to hang and easy to remove (even when using the silicone gel).  I have had another mirror that is sold on Amazon and it is horrible, this one gets the job done.  If your shower is a little dark I highly recommend you get the lighted version.  Best fogless shower mirror I have used.</li>
    <li> This actually worked out pretty well. I filled it up with hot water (per the instructions) and alas! NO fogging during my hot shower. I was able to shave quite comfortably without much hassle. It does give this sort of &amp;#34;fish eye&amp;#34; lens look when you stand back a bit but nothing that would hinder a nice shave. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a decent mirror.</li>
    <li> I gave this mirror four stars because it is truly fogless, with a simple design and construction that strikes a nice balance between convenience and appearance.&lt;br /&gt;  The mirror stays clear at least 45 minutes after adding hot water, and the reflective surface doesn&#x27;t look distorted or cheap to me. Installation is easy: Clean surface, apply adhesive, and mount it.&lt;br /&gt;  I wish the mirror had a little magnification, but that&#x27;s not necessarily a feature everyone would want. If your shower is not well lit, you may want to consider the lighted version of this mirror. Hanging the mirror after filling it with water can be a little hit-or-miss, but you get better at it with practice. Tip: Rest the mirror against the wall-mount, just below the slot, and push the mirror upward against the wall-mount until it falls into the slot. (For me, this method almost always results in success on the first attempt.)&lt;br /&gt;  Since I installed the mirror on the shower wall opposite of where the shower head is located, the mirror never really gets wet. As a result, I don&#x27;t use the squeegee that came with the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Mirror stays fogless as long as you need it to (you can always add more warm or hot water)&lt;br /&gt;- No obvious distortion visible in mirror surface&lt;br /&gt;- Installation was simple and fairly quick&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- No magnification&lt;br /&gt;- No light (ToiletTree offers a more expensive model with a light)&lt;br /&gt;- Mount point is not visible when hanging mirror&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I would recommend this mirror for anyone who&#x27;s looking for a fogless shower mirror that really works, and who doesn&#x27;t mind it&#x27;s inexpensive plastic appearance.</li>
    <li> Followed the instructions on how to mount to wall to the dot and 1 week after put up it has already fallen and broken.  Mirror worked great with no fog but broke a week after getting it because did not stay stuck to shower wall like it guaranteed it would.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband. he used to take 1/2 a shower. keep the water running abd go to the mirror, shave his face and then hop back in the shower. haha silly- right?! so when i seen this i knew hed love it and use it. i put it up in the shower and it worked great. the glue did eventually let go, but no problem buying some from home depot :) happy customer.</li>
    <li> ordered this for my husband&#x27;s shower - it was easy to install and it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Its OK and convenient but it still fogs up. To put hot water behind the mirror one forgets about it and then its a surprise when you hold it up and water splashes on you later.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm. Does not get foggy after putting water in. It&#x27;s a little hard to adjust but other than that it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Hubby and I both absolutely LOVE this shower mirror. Absolutely no complaints and it works as specified. Great product</li>
    <li> Shaving in the shower is a breeze now.  Works great.  Install was easy</li>
    <li> Best fogless mirror I have ever used!  You won&#x27;t be sorry with your purchase!</li>
    <li> Best fog-free mirror I&#x27;ve tried.  In addition to being completely fog proof when used as directed, the mirror image quality is very sharp.  Bought a second for the other shower.  Installation instructions are very clear, and the installation looks bulletproof.</li>
    <li> I have owned this product for more than one year.  I want to respond to the few negative reviews I  have read about it:  First - at least for the way mine was built when I bought it - It is true that the silicone paste supplied is inadequate, and mine fell off the shower wall the first day I put it up too.  A  quick trip to Home Depot for a large replacement tube solved that problem permanently.  Second - It would indeed be nice if the tray for storing things had a ridge to keep things like one&#x27;s razor from falling off occasionally.  All else is good:  The mirror has not gotten foggy to this day.  It remains as clear as it was on the first day. The guy who claimed that the squeegee scratched the mirror must have slipped in a razor blade - mine remains perfect. The guy who said he could not properly manage the squeegee because of his &amp;#34;man hands&amp;#34; should check whether his fingers curl and his thumb is prehensile. The few people who said that the plastic spokes to tilt the mirror position gave way in a few months and the mirror then just hung down:  Have you been clicking it into different positions all the time?  Most people would just pick their mirror position and then leave it there.  The thing is made of plastic for gosh sakes (although it is quite hardy).  Mine still stays in place like a rock.  I have never written a product review before, but this just kept nagging at me.  Hope it helps.</li>
    <li> 1. It was used! still had soap and mineral scale on parts&lt;br /&gt;2. Only had half of the tube of silicon, and you could tell that it was used, i.e. it was rolled up from the end.&lt;br /&gt;3. One of the two-sided tape pads was missing altogether. The other tape pad was unusable; the protective strip had been removed and it was stuck to the plastic bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Returned for refund and I will re-order once refund is processed.  Willing to give it one more chance to actually try and use it; and will update review one way or another.</li>
    <li> Got this for my hubby since he shaves everyday. He loves it and it never fogs up! I would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Worked great at first. Eventually fell off the wall. If I can some how get a new adhesive kit I&#x27;d put it at four stars. They should consider including an extra kit for when it eventually gives up. I don&#x27;t keep water in it for pro-longed periods of time either (empty after I&#x27;m done using it).</li>
    <li> This is actually her husband posting. I bought this mirror, after numerous attempts to find a mirror that doesn&#x27;t fog and that failed, and I waited 8 months to review it to see if it would last.  It takes 7 seconds to fill the water in the back and it has never fogged up.  I LOVE THIS.  It took many years of trial and error to find one that actually works and has NO maintenance at all.  THANK YOU!!!!!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this... unable to wear his glasses while shaving he loves being so close to the mirror so he can see what he&#x27;s doing. Quick delivery (as promised) and super easy installation.</li>
    <li> This mirror works just fine, as long as you follow the install directions.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a solid &amp;#34;No-Fog&amp;#34; shower mirror.</li>
    <li> This product lives up to it&#x27;s claims.  Quick and easy to install (reading the instructions took longer) and it looks and works great!  I think I may be buying a few more of these to give as Christmas gifts.  Shipping was quick and well packaged.  Communications from the seller were excellent, although my wife did raise an eyebrow when she saw the ToiletTree return address.  More like a somewhat confused: &amp;#34;What have you ordered now?&amp;#34; look.  ;D</li>
    <li> Have just installed the mirror and used it a couple of times...after using a different brand for years that I had to keep splashing water on every time it fogged up I have to say this mirror does as they say and doesn&#x27;t fog up...the install is easy and secures nicely to the shower wall...the squeegee is a nice touch also...I&#x27;m only giving 4 stars though because of the size of the mirror...the junk one I used for years was twice the size of this...granted it fogged up all the time but was much nicer to shave with being a taller mirror...u kinda look like ur head is shrunk in the mirror...that is my only complaint...love everything else about this product...hopefully there&#x27;s a bigger one in the works but don&#x27;t no</li>
    <li> Nice size and includes a handy squeegee. This is a replacement for an old one, which used suction cup to mount. I prefer this double sided tape and caulk application for stability. My razor stays put on the shelf so far.</li>
    <li> I bought much more expensive ones in the past, but none worked well. This one is very simple, yet, it is the best. My husband loves it !!!</li>
    <li> The shower mirror went up easily as long as you follow the easy directions.  We have it up for over a week and it hasn&#x27;t moved and it is still fogless!  My husband loves the mirror and the squeegee is the best part!!</li>
    <li> son in law didn&#x27;t want to attach it as specified on the box.  My son-in-law is too picky,didn&#x27;t specify any particular one.</li>
    <li> This mirror is worth the reasonable price. It truly stays fogless when you fill up the tank behind the mirror. The mirror is a good size too. It is easy to install and comes with the silcone. My husband really likes it.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised, never fogs up, easy to install; I would recommend this to anyone looking for a shower mirror.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  #1-  I was a little skeptical at first.  No screws?  It will never work!  I was wrong!  I cleaned the tiles off as directed, applied the silicone adhesive and double sided tape (then ran downstairs real quick to get my level!).  Stuck the mirror to the tile and waited 24 hours.  Done, not coming off anytime soon!  #2- Next, wasn&#x27;t so sure about the whole water behind the mirror trick but after a few uses, it works GREAT!!  You have to take the mirror off before each use and fill it with the same temperature water you are showering with which keeps it from fogging up.  Trust me, it works like a champ.  The mirror just slips on and off from its base no problem, nice design. Squeegee was a nice touch.  #3- Finally, the mirror does swivel up and down which concerns me.  This seems to be the flimsiest part of the mirror.  I put mine at a level that my wife and I can both use so we will not be moving it up or down at all.  I&#x27;ve been shaving for 30 years and this is the best shower mirror I have ever had because of the water behind the mirror trick.</li>
    <li> The product was for my husband and he absoultly loves it.  It works just as it is advertised.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> This mirror realy works.  The product is of excellent quality and gives me the great experience of being able to shave in the shower and see what I&#x27;m doing.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This item was purchased as a gift for my husband.  He shaves daily in the shower using an in shower mirror.  The few occasions I have needed to use his mirror in the shower prompted me to get this product for him, as I could see absolutely nothing but fog.  And it was a supposedly fog free model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS mirror truly delivers:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*It was easy for him to mount.&lt;br /&gt;*We have not been jolted from our sleep due to it falling from the shower wall.&lt;br /&gt;*It really is fog free when you follow the instructions and add warm water.  It&#x27;s like looking into a true mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband had never heard of this product and didn&#x27;t think it would work, since all other &amp;#34;fog free&amp;#34; mirrors have never delivered.  We were both very happy with the mirror.  And my husband really digs the little squeegee, LOL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to all of my friends and family.</li>
    <li> I have only had the mirror installed for about two month now but I love it! It has a fastening gel that holds it to the wall so it won&#x27;t wall and the reservoir in the back keeps it truly fogless! I would definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> My daughter and son-In-law love this mirror in their shower.  I gave it as a Christmas gift based on all the positive reviews.</li>
    <li> Bought to replace the forever falling, suction-cup variety and am pleased so far. Good design. The only drawback is the need to permanently mount the base with silicone adhesive, making it very difficult to access for cleaning and may lead to mold growing behind it.  Not sure what an alternative would be but that seems to be the only flaw we can find.  Overall I would definitely recommend this if permanance or cleaning is not an issue in your bathroom.</li>
    <li> works great and love the squeegee that comes with it. very easy to use and just using the adhesive tape works, though it comes with glue too. Glad we were able to try it out to give a review! You wont regret it if you get one!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband and he is pleased with the mirror. He doesn&#x27;t even mind filling it with warm shower water which is how it stays fogless apparently.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a replacement for my old Shower Tek Fog Free Mirror, which seems to be out of production. This product is superior in every way. It is very easy to install, has a large mirror surface, and does indeed stay fog-free. I think it will be more robust than the old Shower Tek, which connected to the water supply directly, leaked frequently, and was a general hassle when the valves wore. This product will have no such issues, and should last a lifetime.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through quite a few fogless mirrors. I was super skeptical about this - but it works! So long as you fill the container up with hot water from the shower, it stays fog less the entire time - even for 20/25 minute showers like I take &#x3D;p I love this and love that it sticks to the wall and never moves! Best product out there and well worth the price!!</li>
    <li> I have been using the mirror for a short time, it works as advertised. I would definitely recommend it. I have used several others before I found this one, and they always fell short on delivering the features promised. However, this mirror lives up to its promises.</li>
    <li> Purchased two of these - one for my husband and one for my son. The product seems very well made and installed very easily.  The warm water does a great job of keeping the mirror fog-free. Very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband and he loves it.  It does not fog up at all.  It does what it says.</li>
    <li> While we&#x27;ve only been using the mirror for one week, so far so good! I was worried about having to fill the mirror reservoir with water before each use but that has proven to be an easy task and keeps the mirror fog-free.  My only wish was that it had a radio and digital clock included.</li>
    <li> this came 3 days after ordering its big has a nice shelf too! would recommend to others to buy if needed a shower mirror</li>
    <li> Does everything promised. Fabulous product. Will be buying more as gifts in the future. Highly recommended, very pleased with this mirror.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised. It does swivel vertically to adjust for people&#x27;s height but I installed it too low and even at the highest point I still have to duck to shave but I&#x27;m 6&#x27;3&amp;#34;. That is my fault in installing though. But otherwise I love the product.</li>
    <li> Works great. Quality is good for this price point.</li>
    <li> Just used it once so far, but worked great.</li>
    <li> Have had this product for over a year and still going strong. Hubby uses it everyday.</li>
    <li> Works so far, but a bit of a pain to fill with hot water each time.</li>
    <li> This product is a great solution for any shower. It is simple to install and use and really is fog free. Installation took about 5 minutes and maintenance is minimal. I wipe down the face of the mirror with the included squeegee after every shower but I&#x27;m sure it would be fine without it. As another reviewer suggested you can use the water reservoir to clean your razor if your shower is too weak to do it. It is great to be able to quickly shave in the shower instead of spending time in front of the mirror afterwords where it isn&#x27;t as warm. The included squeegee is a great addition to the shelf below but with one more modification this product gets that much better. Using a dremel I cut into the shelf on either side so that two razors can hang there instead of just being able to hold one on the shelf. It would be great if the manufacturer could alter the design slightly to provide this functionality on future models!</li>
    <li> Not worth the money!!.  Not a real mirror, and NEVER stays clean.  Might not fog up (as long as you add water to the container the &amp;#34;mirror&amp;#34; is attached to.</li>
    <li> The mirror is hard to use, and hard to install.  It looks like what you see, but not the best quality.</li>
    <li> I just had a shower mirror and what a pain that is in the winter this really helps, my only problem is the mirror is a little deformed a little fun-house style i feel i just may have gotten unlucky but just to shave its not a problem and the company name is awsome</li>
    <li> Quality product. Easy to install. Seems like a winner!</li>
    <li> Like everyone else says, this product works exactly as advertised.  It is ranked so high because of that fact . . .</li>
    <li> Love it!!!! Use it every day. Will buy a new one when this wears out in a few years.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my boyfriend. A fog-less mirror for shaving was the only item on his Christmas list. This was a great size and it was nice that we didn&#x27;t have to hook this up to the actual shower head, like many that I saw online. My boyfriend loved this and christmas was a success.</li>
    <li> Great mirror has been in use for will over a year abd has not come off shower wall it is still fog free and is used almost daily great product definitely recommend</li>
    <li> Excellent product, does what the description says it will do. Shipped quickly and arrived in pristine condition. Easy to install and maintain, this is a wonderfully convenient product for any man who wants to shave and shower in the same space. Highly recommend this to anyone so inclined.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he really likes it. Works great. His only complaint was that the product itself is kind of bulky, he wishes it was a sleeker design.</li>
    <li> This is the FIRST time we have actually used a mirror that has stayed fog-less in the shower. The concept behind this is amazing and I am delighted to have this! What a unique invention!!</li>
    <li> Easy to mount, nice large mirror for shaving.  Has shelf for razor and squeegee to clean mirror. Initially had a problem with mirror fogging up in the shower.  Added hot water to back compartment as instructed by Steve, problems solved. I now love it.</li>
    <li> This product is truly a fog-less shower mirror.  Very simple design and features.  Works perfectly for shaving in the shower.  Installs quickly and easily.  Makes a nice gift.  Product was delivered quickly.    Only problem is that the silicone adhesive that they provided me with was already dried-up/hard in the tube.  I had to go out and buy a new tube of adhesive which cost about $5.00 (USD).  Would have given this product 5 stars if it wasn&#x27;t for the fact that I had to go out and buy adhesive.     Pros:  It works  Simple install  Includes squeegee    Cons:  Mirror could be bigger.  Silicone adhesive was dried/hard in tube.</li>
    <li> Perfect, works as advertised.  My husband came out of the shower smiling.  No cuts, no frustration, just smiling.  Gotta love it!</li>
    <li> I love this mirror. I can now shave in the shower and see what I&#x27;m doing. And as long as you follow its directions and fill the inside of the mirror with hot water, it is indeed fog less. And if you follow the directions regarding hanging the base, it definitely will not fall. It even comes with a squeegee to wipe water drops off the mirror&#x27;s surface. The base has a ledge to conveniently place the squeegee. Great product if you want to shave in the shower. And it arrived very quickly despite using standard shipping.</li>
    <li> Over the years I have owned many fogless mirrors. This one has them all beat hands down. I have only had it a few weeks but I can already tell it is a great product. The trick with this one is the tank on the back of the mirror that you fill with hot water; this keeps the temperature of the mirror the same as your shower thus eliminating the fog or steam that clouds other mirrors. Once I intentionally did not fill up the tank with water to see what would happen. The mirror did eventually fog but once I filled the tank with hot water and wiped the mirror with the provided squeegee, it was clear and stayed clear for the remainder of the shower. It also has a built in shelf which is handy for your razor. I also left the water in the tank once so that it would be cold when I used it again, and while it did eventually fog up, once again I filled it with hot water and it cleared up. I recommend this product. If, over the next few months, I discover an issue with this product I will write about that as well. If you don&#x27;t see a follow up to this, there has not been a problem.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased.  The item was not only exactly as stated but even better.  It works great!  They also delivered earlier than they said.</li>
    <li> This was the 3rd different fogless shower mirror I have owned and by far the best!   Very easy installation.  Then just fill the mirror with warm/hot water when you enter the shower and absolutely no fog!  Excellent product!!</li>
    <li> I just installed this in a new shower and am very pleased at this point. Simple to install, simple to use and NO fog!  I&#x27;m a little concerned that the swivel will break (light plastic), but only time will tell. In the mean time, it makes shaving in a hot shower a really easy thing. Thanks, ToiletTree Products</li>
    <li> I purchased this shower mirror for my Dad for Christmas.  After many failed purchases of shower mirrors I was quite skeptical, but this is the one!  He absolutely loves it!  Every time I see him he tells me what a great shower mirror this is.  I was concerned that having to fill the water resevoir with each use, however he has said it is completely painless and a non-issue.</li>
    <li> I picked up one of these fogless shower mirrors because I prefer to shave in the shower. I really didn&#x27;t think it would last very long or that it would fog up in the shower anyway but I figured I&#x27;d give it a try. To my surprise it works really well and since mounting it up on my shower, the adhesive has stuck. A+ item!</li>
    <li> I received this mirror a week ago, and it works as well as promised.  It was very easy to install, and extremely durable.  If you follow the simple instructions, it works just perfectly.  I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll ever need a shower mirror again as it doesn&#x27;t look like it will rust or fall off the wall - ever, like other ones I&#x27;ve had in the past.  It may cost a little extra, but will save you money and frustration in the long run.  The old cliche - \\&quot;you get what you pay for,\\&quot; rings through and through with this purchase.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Up until I received this product, the thought of having a mirror in my shower never even crossed my mind.  But, now that I have one in there, I donft think I can ever go back.  You simply attach the miror to the wall inside your shower using a silicone gel.   To keep the mirror fogless, you just have to remove the mirror off the bracket and fill the back container up with hot water.  Itfs because of the hot water in the back  of the mirror that the front of the mirror keeps from fogging.  And it works and it realy is super easy to use.     The mirror itself is adjustable, so once you mount it securely to wall, you can move it to accomodate anyone at any height, which is important to someone like me who is a mere 5f2 (my hubby is 6).  So now, I can pluck and exfoliate at my level and Chris can shave up at his.  Itfs perfect for both of us.</li>
    <li> This is the first product of this type that I have had that has worked flawlessly.  I have tried 3 or 4 fogless shaving mirrors in the past and none have done what they claimed, they would fog up in no-time in the shower.  This one is GREAT, I have had it for about a month and it has not fogged yet.  The other thing about it is secure on the wall of the shower and I am confident it will not fall.  The only minor problem in the putting it on the wall was the adhesive that came with the mirror had dryed out and was useless.  I just went to a local hardware store and bought a tube of adhesive and was good to go.  If you are looking for this type of product don&#x27;t mess with any other kind  GET THIS ONE!!!!!</li>
    <li> This mirror was easy to install and my husband loves it.  No more cutting himself while shaving. It may be a little pricey, but not compared to what&#x27;s out there!</li>
    <li> I recently received a shaving kit as a gift that included a shaving brush, pre-shave oil and shaving cream. The manufacturer of the gift set recommended shaving in the shower for best results and I finally decided to change my shaving routine (believe it or not, I used to shave before showering). As I often do, I logged on to amazon to look for a quality shower mirror and came across this product by ToiletTree. As the prior reviewers have noted, the mirror is excellent (not sure what that one reviewer complaining about image distortion/quality was talking about), it does not fog up and the installation is simple. Kudos to ToiletTreet for manufacturing such a clever and hi-quality product and may I add that the installation directions are excellent (they tell you exactly where to place the adhesive, how much and for how long). Oh yeah, my shaving experience is much better now, thanks ToiletTree!</li>
    <li> Goddam I look good in this mirror.  I can see my chiseled jawline and thoroughbred features perfectly, no matter how much steam is in the shower.  Decent mirror, five-star face. Goddam.</li>
    <li> This mirror uses silicone instead of a suction cup to mount on the wall.  The silicone provides very solid adhesion and you do not have to worry about the mirror falling.  Before using the mirror, you must fill the reservoir with hot water (I usually just fill it with the warm shower water).  With the hot water in the reservoir, the mirror does stay fog less.  It even comes with a little squeegee to remove water droplets from the mirror.</li>
    <li> I have hard water and that squeegy leaves a lot of little droplets behind. I&#x27;m afraid it will eventually be crudded over, especially since I can&#x27;t use cleaning agents to clean the mirror&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: - I was told by the company that white vinegar is ok to use to clean off the hard water stains</li>
    <li> The Fogless Shower Mirror is in fact fog-free, however the description does not mention that you need to fill the mirror up with warm water in order for it not to fog. This is not a huge inconvience but get be a little annoying, especially in the mornings when you&#x27;re half asleep. All and all it serves it&#x27;s purpose as a fogless shower mirror.</li>
    <li> I HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone interested in purchasing a fogless shower mirror.  Very easy to mount.  I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now, and it hasn&#x27;t budged even slightly from it&#x27;s original spot</li>
    <li> This product works well. It is 100% fog-free and is easy to install. The squeegee works pretty well but does miss some droplets here and there - no big deal. The built-in shelf is a nice bonus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is slightly annoying to have to fill it with water every time you use it but it really only takes a few seconds to fill it up - so no point in complaining really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;1) Empty it when you&#x27;re done! If you leave water in it overnight it will get cold and when you re-fill it the mirror will warp. Emptying it after each use fixes this issue.&lt;br /&gt;2) Think before you install it. I did, but not well enough. I installed it to the right of the shower caddy that hangs from the spout. But i installed it too close so the edge of the mirror just barely touches the caddy. Also I have to life the caddy out of the way in order to remove the squeegee - MY FAULT. Just think before you actually install it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this fogless mirror for a few weeks now - here&#x27;s my quick &amp; dirty review:    The installation is simple and takes about 3 minutes (then you let it set for ~12 hours).  The mirror itself works great as long as you keep the reservoir filled with warm-hot water.  The stand itself let&#x27;s you angle the mirror up/down which is great in case my wife wants to use it - she can tilt it down.  Not much left to comment on.    All in all a great product - especially at the price.</li>
    <li> This is the first review I have ever bothered to write because I am so happy with the product.  I still expect it to fog up because of bad experiences with other mirrors but it hasn&#x27;t failed me after many months.  I highly recommend it to everyone like me that is frustrated with buying expensive mirrors that claim to be fog-free but are not.  I looked at the reviews prior to purchasing it and all the positive reviews are dead on while all of the negative reviews are not.  it is not true that the squeegee supplied will scratch the mirror or that is is like a fun house mirror.  Unless you plan to shave 6 feet away from it, then it&#x27;s perfect.  My eyes would fail me far before the mirror would.  You can also fit two razors on the mini landing if you place the heads on opposite ends.</li>
    <li> I had this product given to me as a gift several months ago and though I did like it at the beginning, it was a bit too large for my shower. It was a bit of a pain to assemble and in the end a bit too much work just to shave in the shower.  Plus, for some reason the razor ledge wasn&#x27;t very sturdy and I&#x27;d always be dodging falling mach3s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose my wife got a little sick of hearing that razor drop and my whining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife just recently gifted this mirror to me (yes, she&#x27;s great!)&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00CNOUZE2 Fogless Shower Mirror - Guaranteed Fog Free - Exclusive to Amazon - No Suction Cups - Designed Not to Fall - Ultra-easy Set up - Includes Additional Razor Wall Mount]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it has a sturdy razor hook, so I&#x27;m ecstatic about that, but now that it is&lt;br /&gt;hanging it my shower, I think wifey bought it for me because the stainless&lt;br /&gt;steel hooks look nicer.  She&#x27;s sneaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in the end, I really liked the Toilet Tree Mirror and it definitely&lt;br /&gt;will do the job you want, but for me it lacked a few essentials for my situation.  The choice is yours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I started using the Fogless Shower Mirror last week and I love it.  It is so nice to not have the mirror fogging up.  When I get out of the shower I sit the mirror on my bathroom counter and can start getting ready right away.</li>
    <li> Nice design, easy install, BUT still fogs up during a shower.  The built in squeegee helps keep it in check but isn&#x27;t that effective.  Better than nothing I guess.</li>
    <li> This item is fantastic. Very easy to install. We just re-did our bathroom in ceramic and spent a ton of money and I was a little skeptical of installing a plastic mirror but wow it looks amazing and works very very well. Looking for a nice fog free mirror--this is it.</li>
    <li> We have tried several shower mirrors in the past.  This product stays on the wall, stays fog-free and does what it promises.  We are very satisfied.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this... Great product, clear, large view, squeegee, razor holder!  Completely fogless.  FYI - Don&#x27;t waste your money on the suggested 3M adhesive strips.  This product comes with a tube of silicone that holds the frame of the mirror to the wall &amp;#34;semi&amp;#34; permanently.  Which means, if you ever (why would you?) want to remove it, you would just pull it down and peel the silicone off the tile.  It looks sleek, not tacky, as if it belongs in the shower.  If you forget and leave the water in it after showering, just dump it on the person you shower with the next time you shower, that&#x27;s what i do! It&#x27;s freaking cold and I only got slapped once... every time it keeps getting funnier (to me anyway).</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror for 2 reasons.  First, I&#x27;ve tried quite a few fogless mirrors and all of them had some anti-fogging coating that wore out within a month or so.  Second, I moved into a new house and the shower walls are porous, making it impossible to use suction cups to keep a shaving mirror up.    This product solves both problem flawlessly.  The silicone adhesive sticks to any surface basically and the warm water reservoir in the back ensures that the mirror never fogs up.  In addition, the design of the mirror is great to keep your razor and the squeegee nearby.  Great product, I&#x27;m really glad I gave this a shot.</li>
    <li> This is an update to my original review- This mirror does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do- it&#x27;s fog less and fantastic! PLUS, after a year and a half of perfect use, the back unglued from my shower wall- I contacted the company and the owner answered me back within a half hour of my email. Sent me a new piece that arrived OVERNIGHT!! EXCELLENT, PERFECT customer service!!! Highly recommended product and company!</li>
    <li> This item works as advertised. It is of a higher quality construction than most other shower mirrors, and when installed and used as directed will definitely stay attached and remain fog-free. Would recommend to anyone who is frustrated with other fog-free shower mirrors that fog up. You must add in warm shower water before each use, but it does then stay fog-free.</li>
    <li> I wish I would&#x27;ve known about this10 years ago.  Works just as advertised.  Easily fills and mounts securely to the wall</li>
    <li> Fantastic product and my husband and I are in love.  It&#x27;s the first mirror on the market that truly is fogless even with the hottest steam in the shower.  Perfect for shaving and removing makeup and the included shelf is such a bonus to hold the razor.  These are definitely gifts I&#x27;m grabbing for the holiday season.</li>
    <li> I was afraid of purchasing a &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; shower mirror for my husband because it meant there was another &amp;#34;step&amp;#34; involved before he could start shaving. However, I went ahead and bought one for his Christmas present. I sort of apologized when he opened it, thinking he&#x27;s balk when he read the directions that he&#x27;d need to pour warm water into the reservoir, but he didn&#x27;t! He used his new mirror on Christmas Day and said it worked like a pro. I was SO relieved. Thanks for this great product.</li>
    <li> I installed this mirror in my shower according to the instructions one week ago, and it has lived up to my expectations.  So far it has remained firmly attached to my shower wall and, when I fill the mirror with hot water at the beginning of my shower, the mirror remains fogless.for the duration of my shower.  I hope this will continue!!!</li>
    <li> I do all my facial grooming in the shower, so after years of wasting time with cheap crap &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; mirrors that were anything but, I decided to pony up for the real deal. The design of this mirror is elegant in its simplicity: when you use water to make the mirror as hot as or hotter than the shower water, it&#x27;s physically impossible for it to fog. Being a person who enjoys seeing simple concepts spun into useful, reliable products, I was sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad to say, this product works as advertised. You wait for the water to get hot, slide the mirror up off the mount, fill up the reservoir, then slip it back into place... the whole process takes about 10 seconds. I like to set the faucet to full hot when filling the mirror, this way the water&#x27;s sure to keep the mirror warm no matter how long I&#x27;m in the shower. Afterwards, spend another 5 seconds dumping the water from the reservoir and you&#x27;re good to go. The included squeegee is a nice touch, so far it&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve ever needed to clean this mirror off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for negatives, this mirror&#x27;s expensive for what it is and what it&#x27;s made out of, but you&#x27;re paying more for the innovation than the materials. The installation also takes more work than most &amp;#34;stick it on the wall&amp;#34; shower mirrors, but I guess you need extra support since the water is heavy. Plastic construction means there will always be slight distortion of the reflection, but nothing to write home about. None of these cons were significant enough to knock a star off the rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re the kind of person who prefers to &amp;#34;manscape&amp;#34; in the shower, this thing&#x27;s a must-have. Not much else needs to be said.</li>
    <li> It feels flimsy when it is full of water. It hasn&#x27;t fallen or anything, though. It does stay fogless when u put water in it.</li>
    <li> I use this thing every day, and every day I think &amp;#34;Man, I should go write a review to help people understand just how well this works, what a great design it is, and how it just slightly brightens every one of my days.&amp;#34; Finally today I&#x27;m off my butt doing that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bullets, everyone wants bullets:&lt;br /&gt;* Angles nicely&lt;br /&gt;* Unobtrusive&lt;br /&gt;* Has never fallen down once&lt;br /&gt;* The ritual of dumping cold water from yesterday and filling with warm water for today is both comforting and pleasurable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a world where we subconsciously bump and catch on design flaws in products we use every day, this is a standout success. I wish I could meet the person/team that designed it so I could shake their hands and tell them how much I love their work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should totally get this.</li>
    <li> Does as advertised.  Can tilt to accommodate folks of different heights.</li>
    <li> Easy to install, stays clear when follow directions.  Used only a short time but if it stands the test of time.  Best mirror I have had.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly, functions exactly as described in the description.  Easy to install, hangs secure in tile. Makes shaving in the shower easy!</li>
    <li> Great product!  This is the second ToiletTree shower mirror I&#x27;ve purchased.  I bought one three years ago for our last home and left it behind for the buyers when we recently sold it.  A new ToiletTree mirror was one of my first purchases for the shower in our new home!  It works exactly as advertised and stays on the shower wall without fail.  The built-in squeegee is a nice touch and allows you to keep the mirror spot-free.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Finally, something that works as designed and advertised and doesn&#x27;t require anything additional. Mounting it on my shower wall was a breeze. Just fill it with hot water and the mirror will not fog, simple physics. The included squeegee is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Gave it t my boss as a gift, and she absolutely loves it! great price, great product ... I am a happy camper!!!</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time, was very easy to install, looks great, and works as claimed.  What more can you ask?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve struggled for years with the standard $10 suction-cup shaving mirrors. Trying to clear just a tiny bit of the mirror surface so I can see what I&#x27;m doing while I shave was part of my routine.    This product is just perfect. First, the mirror itself is quite large, so I don&#x27;t have to contort myself to see what I&#x27;m doing. The adjustable hinge is also great for getting better angles, and for use by my better half.     The fogless system is just great. Fill it up with hot water, clip it on, and that&#x27;s it. The included squeegee takes up almost no space and does what it needs to.     Very happy with this system. I bought it on a whim, but it&#x27;s honestly made my life slightly better.</li>
    <li> I bought it and have been using it for 3 months.  It always fogs up.  Total waste of money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve really enjoyed this -- my wife got it for me almost a year ago and it&#x27;s been fantastic.  Previously, I just cycled through a variety of mirrors and just threw them out every month or so and replaced with the next one. The Toilettree product has been much better and it&#x27;s easy to install as well!</li>
    <li> I have owned other supposedly fogless mirrors and never could get them to work. This one is awesome,doesn&#x27;t fog up and the way it stays on the shower wall keeps me from having the midnight wake up call of it falling off on to the ground.   One nice to have would be a small light or something that was battery powered underneath the mirror But that&#x27;s mostly a limitation the bathroom lightly more than an issue with this mirror.   I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The product works as advertised.  I&#x27;ve used mine since purchase without any problems including dropping it once.  Mirrow does not fog when direction are follows.  One caveat:  You must adhere it to a vertical surface.  I purchased mine to place on a shelf but it will not stand on shelf.  I would definitely purchase again without hesitation.</li>
    <li> Everyone in my house LOVES this mirror~!!  We&#x27;ve tried other shower mirrors before and they just didn&#x27;t make the grade.  Usually after the FIRST shower, our mirrors would fall off of the suction cups or it wouldn&#x27;t stay in place and do this slooooow slide down the shower wall.  When I first heard of Toilettree&#x27;s Shower Mirror, I was skeptical...it seemed to me that every mirror I ever tried had the same exact claim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I took it out of the box, my first impression was how solid it felt and I was like, here we go, its not going to stick, it&#x27;s just WAY too heavy!!!  SHOCK~!!  From the moment I put it up and to this EXACT second as you read this review, that mirror is STILL in it&#x27;s original place~!!!  PLUS, we have never complained about it fogging up on us...and I LOVE a VERY hot shower and I&#x27;ve never had a cause for concern...you should see the steam roll out of the bathroom after I come out...hehe&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Putting it in place was a breeze~!!  All I had to do was slide the mirror off of its bracket BEFORE each shower and add HOT water.  The water keeps the mirror the same temperature as the shower water you are washing in, making it scientifically IMPOSSIBLE for the mirror to ever fog up!!  Isn&#x27;t that neat??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If water drops get on the mirror and hinders your beauty regime, then you just slide the squeegee off the bottom and swipe the droplets away...really easy~!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to everyone who likes to do all their personal business in the shower AND the health benefits are more than beneficial to any individual~!  I believe the Toilettree Fogless Shower Mirror would make an EXCELLENT Christmas, Birthday, Father/Mother&#x27;s Day or ANY day in which you need a unique gift to give to your friends and loved ones~!!</li>
    <li> Have purchased at least 10 other mirrors that never worked, this one does, its cheap and stays adhered to the wall.  The others always fog up and eventually fall off in the middle of the night and scare you to death</li>
    <li> Delivered quickly!  Works well!</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace a cheap \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; mirror that just didn&#x27;t work.  This mirror is a perfect addition to the shower and makes shaving a breeze.  Easy to fill and easy to empty (takes about 5 seconds for each) so I don&#x27;t understand the issues some other folks have with either.  Buy it . . .  it&#x27;s a good price and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  Installation is a snap and it hasn&#x27;t fallen down yet.</li>
    <li> Really all I can say is that it actually works.  I&#x27;ve had a couple of \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; mirrors before and they would typically work for a few weeks and then would fog up.    I read the reviews on here and it seemed good, so I bought it.  Install was extremely straight forward.  Just fill up the mirror with warm shower water and it works.  Not much else to say.  I&#x27;ve had it for about one month.  Hopefully it will last.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant about adhering this mirror to my shower tile.  But I followed the directions correctly and the mirror actually stuck the to tile very well. The idea behind this mirror is that it is no-fog due to a water chamber directly behind the mirror.  Which, upon entering the shower you fill up the reservoir, and place the mirror back on the mount.  If you follow these instructions the mirror is awesome. What&#x27;s really cute about it is that it comes with a tiny squeegee to wipe off the water droplets after filling the reservoir.  And yes, the mirror is no fog after this.&lt;br /&gt;If you can follow directions, then this is the mirror for you.</li>
    <li> I saw this product and read the reviews before I purchased it. I had no issues installing it and it stayed fog free for the most part. After using it a few weeks I noticed that the mirror would no longer stay in position on the swivel once filled with water. The weight was too much for it. Now just the mirror empty will not stay in position. You lift it up on the swivel and it instantly drops back down. The only way to use the product is to remove the mirror and hold it in your hand. The concept is great but the quality not so much.</li>
    <li> Let me be number 619 to shout my praises for this mirror.  I ordered it on Wednesday and had it midday Friday. The only thing it is lacking is a hook to hang the razor on but I will stick one to the back of the mirror water casing. There is a little shelf but a razor can get knocked off that easily. Otherwise it is just perfect.  5 stars for the mirror, Amazon and Prime.  After using it for a few weeks, I would like to suggest something for the manufacturer.  Just add a small valve at the bottom of the water reservoir to release the water and let it drain.</li>
    <li> Best shower mirror ever! Works perfectly ever time! Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> I got this for my hubby for Chritmas.  He loves it and especially that it doesn&#x27;t fog up.  He is so pleased!  I would highly recommend this product and this seller.</li>
    <li> I read through almost every review before buying this mirror. I took the good with the bad and decided THAT many goods can&#x27;t be wrong. I&#x27;m glad I did because this mirror is great. I&#x27;ve bought so many \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; mirrors in the past and this was the last attempt. It truly does work as promised. Extremely easy to install, extremely easy to use. I love it, it&#x27;s like having a little flat screen tv in your shower and you&#x27;re the star!I was worried about the whole dumping water and refilling, thinking there&#x27;d need to be a cup in the shower, etc. But no worries there...you slide it off, fill it with the shower water, slide it back on and BOOM! Fogless!This product is definitely worth the money. Truly the best -actual- fogless mirror on the market!</li>
    <li> I read all of the positive reviews on this product and bought it for my husband solely on those reviews.  It was just impossible for me to imagine that filling the reservoir with warm water before each use would not be a pain and, believe me, my husband is a worker but does not wish be one when showering and/or shaving.  Well, the reviews were spot on.  He loves the mirror and says it&#x27;s no trouble at all to fill the reservoir because the mirror easily slides off of the mounting bracket, the reservoir is easy to fill, and the mirror glides effortlessly back on to the bracket.  Plus, it&#x27;s worth the small amount of effort given that the mirror really does NOT fog!</li>
    <li> I was not a fan of mirrors that needed water to be fogless, however it is probably the best and possibly the only way to accomplish that task long term.  This mirror is big clear and completely fogless when used properly.  Nice mounting system.  All around two thumbs up.</li>
    <li> Purchased in 2013. It&#x27;s now 2017 and I still use it every day and absolutely love it. Zero problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anti-fog element works perfectly. Takes about 10 seconds to fill from the shower head. Mirror is fine for shaving although it&#x27;s not a glass mirror, so don&#x27;t expect zero distortion. Doesn&#x27;t budge on wall. The squeegee is helpful, but the little shelf is kinda useless, so don&#x27;t expect to put much other than a delicately balanced razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product, and I love shaving in the shower now, and this mirror is a big part of it.</li>
    <li> We searched for years for a truly fogless mirror that will actually stay mounted to the shower wall and this is it. Great size and the built in shelf is a nice touch. Would recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> I have been trying to purchase a fogless mirror for my son for the past 3 years and have had no luck. I have purchased mirrors from Abercrombe and Finch costing $100. and they did not work. Not even for a little while. I am very happy with this mirror. I would recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve run through at least a dozen other &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; mirrors only to be continually disappointed...until now.  While the ToiletTree mirror does require you to fill it with water before using, it consistently delivers on the fogless promise.  I&#x27;ve only owned the mirror for 2 months but it has a very durable base, so it should offer some longevity. I highly recommend</li>
    <li> This mirror works!  Besides not fogging, it is well constructed, has no metal parts to rust, and comes with a way to attach to the shower wall that is going to hold up indefinitely.  Definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> The mirror arrived very quickly after placing the order.  The installation was quite easy, and the mirror is very secure on my tiled shower wall.  It works exactly as described.  It only takes a few seconds to fill the back of the mirror with water and then use the convenient squeegee to wipe off excess water.  The mirror surface stays fogless through the entire shower.  I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Simply the best fogless mirror I have ever purchased (and I have had a few).  Ingenious water reservoir design holds the hot water from your shower to equal or match the temperature of the atmosphere thus prevent ANY fog.  Brilliant!</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror for my husband and he loves it!! We&#x27;ve been through many supposedly fogless mirrors and this one is by far the best we have ever found. Great product. Very fast shipping. Great customer service. Totally worth it!!</li>
    <li> All working well. I expected you to send the object overseas, but you don&#x27;t. So I  asked for a friend to bring it for me.</li>
    <li> First of all, the product works great! My problem is that after one month of using, the plastic connection point from the mirror to the fixed wall structure is already not doing it&#x27;s job . You normally can turn the mirror up &amp; down, and if this is used to many times, the plastic just can not hold the mirror up anymore, it will always face down. This is only happening with the water loaded full to the top as then the mirror become top heave. I guess if you are alone, this is not a problem, but like me, with kids, they also use the shower and this is an issue.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband. He had an old mirror that was falling apart and was just gross. It continually fogged up during his shaving session and he was constantly having to wipe it off. The Fogless Shower Mirror with Squeegee is great. It does what it says. There is no fog and I just can&#x27;t believe how wonderful it is. He loves it. I should have saved it for Christmas.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift for my husband, he absolutely loves it.</li>
    <li> First and last bathroom mirror to buy ,it works like a charm</li>
    <li> Pros: Easy to mount (use a level if you are OCD). Mirror quality okay. Fogless works as advertised. Like that the squeegee is the right size to swipe the mirror in one wipe and like the way it stores easily below the rack in the built in slot.  Overall, this is a good product.  Suggestions: I should have ordered the one with the LED lights to make it easier to see. It would be nice if the mirror were a little larger. It should be redesigned to fit more flush on the wall. It sticks out a little too far.  And the bottom tray should have a lip on all sides to prevent the shaver or accessories from falling off!  That would be a big plus and easy redesign.  Thanks.  I like shaving in the shower. Better with the warm steam and keeps the shavings from clogging the sink drain.</li>
    <li> With the lighting in my bathroom I need a light. A little too much of a &amp;#34;permanant&amp;#34; installation for my liking too.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with this product and would  buy it again. Works as well as stated.</li>
    <li> **updated Review 12/26/15 lost 2 stars  Product worked great for 10 months then mirror (plastic, definitely not glass) started to tarnish. Water spots couldn&#x27;t be cleaned off. It was still usable but showed it age. After the 12 months of everyday showers, it finally succumbed to old age and let go from the tile wall. Crashing onto the shower floor, it shattered. First world problems, I&#x27;ve had to finish shaving in front of my bathroom mirror, in the fridged cold... *sigh* maybe I&#x27;ll buy another on. It really worked well for the first 10 months and basically limped to the finish.   ---------------------------------- Original Review 12/20/14 - 5 stars  So far so good! Been using this for 2 weeks now. It does has a clown house effect when you stand back from the mirror, but I usually shave up close anyway. I dump the water out after each use and refill while I&#x27;m in the shower.</li>
    <li> This item is pricey for what you get, It feels cheap and plasticky. I was so excited to get this as it looks so smart and having a fogless mirror is quite a novelty. Thankfully I didn&#x27;t throw out my old reliable mirror as it is now back on the bathroom shelf and this one is in the spare bathroom (don&#x27;t have the heart to return it or throw it away). I think it is meant only to be wallmounted. It came with some silicon glue and a stick of some sort, not too sure what they were for but didn&#x27;t bother with them. The stand is wobbly and doesn&#x27;t feel like it will last long, it sways around when you have it on the shelf. There is an adjustable round control at the back but when I turned it I thought I better stop as it sounded like it was going to break.I did have fun blowing on the mirror and it is 100% fogless but if it can&#x27;t stand on the shelf and it looks slightly 3D when you look into it, I guess it is not worth it at all. Don&#x27;t like giving a very low star rating but honestly I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone - it is fogless though ;-) (update) I bought it with the intention to use it on the bathroom ledge but it doesn&#x27;t stand too solidly and is a bit wobbly. I guess if you use it in the shower by mounting it on the wall it may work a bit better.</li>
    <li> the PERFECT solution for a picky shower-shaver!</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work very well. A real mirror might help, but who  knows. No one seems to have solved the problem comopletly</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband and he really loves it.  He&#x27;s had shower shaving mirrors before, but he says this is the best yet.  It does not fall off the wall and it works perfectly everytime.</li>
    <li> I love this thing.  Wish I had started shaving in the shower sooner.  Could be a little cheaper but I don&#x27;t imagine I will need another one anytime soon so eh.  As a bonus I can watch myself shower which is great.</li>
    <li> Works just as advertised.  It&#x27;s nice to have a dependable mirror in the shower that will actually last!</li>
    <li> Personally I think it is a little creepy to watch myself take a shower, but my husband loves this mirror and uses it every day to shave.  It hasn&#x27;t scared the pants off of us by falling off the shower wall at 2am like the others either, so that was a bonus!</li>
    <li> perfect , perfect, perfect, and it is true adding water every morning is no hassle at all. I bought it for me and I am very happy</li>
    <li> I AM HAPPY TO SAY THAT I SURE ENJOY SHAVING IN THE SHOWER WITHOUT A FOGGY MIRROR.  I SURE THINK THIS IS A GREAT IDEA AND THE SQUEEGEE IDEA IS ALSO GREAT.  SO FAR I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I have really enjoyed having this fog free shower mirror for the last 5 months.  I have babied it wanting it to last as long as possible.  I dry it off after every shower.  It is the first thing I use my towel on.  Unfortunately, the mirror began to crack and peel away.  I was really upset and assumed there would only be a year or so of useful life with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very surprised that Toiletree seriously stands behind their product and offered a replacement.  This is pretty nice and I appreciate their customer service.  I realy do like the function of the mirror.  It works so well.</li>
    <li> Excellent mirror: easy to install, easy to use. I installed the mirror without my husbands assistance.  Larger size is only improvement that could be made.</li>
    <li> I ordered a fog free mirror from Toilettree that developed a slight blur mark on the mirror. I contacted Toilettree ( Kelly Parisi ) and she was fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;Within one day she sent a brand new mirror .&lt;br /&gt;Great customer service &amp; I highly recommend their mirrors.  Best I have ever used!</li>
    <li> Had a different product from bed bath &amp; beyond that was never really fogless. This mounts up securely and truly stays completely fogless. The quality of the mirror is also much better than I&#x27;ve seen at local stores as far as the clarity of the mirror. Overall very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Arrived sooner than expected. Easy to install - appears to be very secure. Has not fogged at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Squeegee is a welcome addition and the ledge under the mirror easily accommodates my razor. I am very happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also appreciate the manufacturer&#x27;s concern that I was completely satisfied with the product, which they expressed in a follow-up email to me.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT I BOUGHT TWO OF THEM ONE FOR MY SON IN LAW.  IT WORKS LIKE NO OTHER</li>
    <li> I have 5 of these mirrors not because they don&#x27;t work but because they do. Gave them to all my family members and just bought one for my new house.  I love this mirrow works great, I love it.  If you are thinking about a foggless mirror this is the only one to get.</li>
    <li> Great! Does not fog if I am running exhaust fan in shower.  If I forget to turn on fan. I just fill mirror reservoir with water from the shower.</li>
    <li> This works great.  I love it.  It sticks out from the wall a few inches so make sure you have room.</li>
    <li> You won&#x27;t find a better shower mirror.  Be patient and follow the instructions and it will work perfectly for you.&lt;br /&gt;I thought it was cheap but the Squeegee works very cool. AWSOME!</li>
    <li> This is a very good product. There&#x27;re a lot of similar items out there but this one performs as indicated. My nephew asked me for it for his new apartment since he prefers to shave and style in the shower. He has one of those old bathrooms without a fan so it gets foggy.&lt;br /&gt;He absolutely loves this mirror. I&#x27;m planning to get another one as a gift for someone&#x27;s stocking stuffer! The company that sells this is number one in my book as far as customer service and follow up. I received the shipment in just a couple of days and I appreciated that. I do most of my shopping online so this is the kind of detail that is appreciated. Great job!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband a couple months ago so he can shave his face &amp; head in the shower. It&#x27;s exactly what he needed and works just as advertised.</li>
    <li> Best fogless mirror we&#x27;ve ever owned and we&#x27;ve owned them all!</li>
    <li> I rarely post reviews on Amazon, and having purchased this product in June, and mounted it exactly as stated usin both sticky tabs and the entire tube of silicone glue, that it works magnificently and I enjoyed using it daily to shave, that is until it fell off my shower wall while I was at work today. Now , I&#x27;m lost as I will miss it tomorrow morning but after falling off the wall in less than 4 months of use, do I dare try to reattach it. Must first clean the silicone goo off of my laminate shower wall before I even consider it. Would have been a 5 star product if it just would have stayed in place. Damnedest thing is I bought two, one for the other bathroom, and just haven&#x27;t mounted it yet. Still giving it 3 stars for the 3 1/2 months it was in service. Any others with this issue.?</li>
    <li> Love it, great transaction, quick shipping, thanks so much!!</li>
    <li> I have the same problem as a lot of people. Mirror works great but the adjustable part breaks after a while and the mirror won&#x27;t stay up. Frustrating, i would buy another but unless they fixed the problem i will look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> This was a gift and works as it says.</li>
    <li> This is the best shower mirror I have used by far.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is one Fog Free mirror that REALLY works</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband.  It does exactly what it claims.  It actually works! Put the shower water in the back and it does not fog up.  It was pretty easy to install. He likes the idea of the silicone instead of suction cups. Hopefully it holds up. I like the idea of the swivel head so I can use it too! There is a little bit of distortion when you are not close to it but not enough to bother me.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and excellent product</li>
    <li> Hands down the best shower mirror ever. The mounting is super strong and the mirror itself perfect. It does not fog PERIOD.</li>
    <li> Mounts easily and when filled with warm water, does not fog.  Squeegee brush holder and tray are nice touches.  Mount it at the right height because it is hard to change the angle of the mirror.</li>
    <li> Works great, has a cute little squeegee. Seems to mount very solid (been up 2 weeks). It&#x27;s revolutionized the way I feel about shampoo induced shower mohawks. I really think I could pull it off at the office.</li>
    <li> Simple and effective. Has been hanging on my tile for months without any hint of moving. The mirror itself stays clear, and the little shelf is great for keeping my razor out of the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend that you don&#x27;t store your razor blade down like in the photo. At least for me, the conditioning pads of my razor seem to stick to the shelf and leave a nasty mess. I store mine on its side.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Fogless Shower Mirrow for my husband for a Valentines Day present.&lt;br /&gt;He loves it! The mirrow mounts easily on to the tile, it does not fog, and its a good&lt;br /&gt;quality product. I would recommend this mirror to any man that likes to shave in&lt;br /&gt;the shower.</li>
    <li> Stuck to wall great and works super great My hubby shaves  more often and now we are both happy. Thanks for the wonderful shower mirror.  You wont be disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> I happened to meet Paul from ToiletTree Products a month or so again, and he was kind enough to send me the fogless mirror to test it out. It&#x27;s a great product. Makes my morning routine that much more pleasant. Works as promised. Thanks Paul.</li>
    <li> Works well but fell off wall after a few months, need to re-attach it. Recommend keeping it clear of shower spray so it stays clean.</li>
    <li> We have purchased other &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; mirrors in the past that did not live up to their claims of being fogless. The past mirrors not only fogged up, but would constantly fall off of the wall. My husband absolutely loves this mirror. The mirror has not fallen once since we put up in December. You have to add water to it each time you shower which you might think would be a pain, but it is easy and not an issue for my husband. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is the best mirror I have got in a long time, works like a champ easy to install and use.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband and he absolutely loves it!!  And he has recommended it to a friend!!  Good quality also!</li>
    <li> This mirror does exactly what is advertised. The unit needs to be filled with hot water. Once filled it doesn&#x27;t fog at all. It cleans easily with the provided squeegee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took five minutes to install. No suction cups to deal with!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mirror was flat and does not create a distorted view of your face when you look at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this purchase. -  I would recommend this unit to anyone looking for a good shower mirror.</li>
    <li> After spending thousands of dollars(well maybe not thousands) on shaving mirrors, this one actually does what it says.Easy mounting and NO fog, even in the steamiest shower.Every man who shaves in the shower should buy one!</li>
    <li> Been looking for one of these that WORKED for a while. Follow the instructions as written and your in !</li>
    <li> Honestly, this shower mirror is the best shaving mirror I could find. It installed easily.  I had concerns about the glue damaging the cultured marble shower walls, so called ToiletTree.  They assured me it had been tested on many different shower surfaces and it safely secured to all.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for a few weeks now, and it is truly fogless. Works very well. A bit of a production to put up, since it requires using a silicone adhesive and waiting 24 hours for it to cure. That is the price to be paid of filling the back of the mirror with heavy water. They say it is removable adhesive, but I obviously have not tested that yet. But fogless performance is excellent.</li>
    <li> Works well, you have to fill with hot water though kind of a draw back&lt;br /&gt;Great transaction</li>
    <li> We haven&#x27;t even had this mirror for 4 months and it is already broken :(  As soon as we fill it with water, it faces straight downward and does not have enough strength to face forward.  It used to be fine but it has gotten worse and worse over the months and is now to the point where it doesn&#x27;t even hold up anymore.  We tried only putting 1/2 the amount of water but it didn&#x27;t make a difference.  Disappointed in the quality.</li>
    <li> Great quality, works just as good as it claims to.  Worth it!</li>
    <li> as others before me have said it works like it says. glue it on the wall, wait 12 hours and viola, shower mirror.  i&#x27;ve used more expensive shower mirrors that have not worked as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i would like to add a caviat after i&#x27;ve had the item for several months the ratchet-type device wore out and the mirror would not stay straight so that i could see my face when i would shave. so i used a cap from my can of shaving cream and that seems to have solved the problem</li>
    <li> I have used a fogless shower mirror for years. They all were pretty much inferior but worked to some extent.  This mirror, however, actually works really well!  It stays on the tile, doesn&#x27;t fog, and I can really see myself while I shave.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I ordered this mirror as a birthday present for my husband and he loves it!&lt;br /&gt;It realy doesn&#x27;t fog up and so far has stayed in the shower without falling.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best mirror out there. I have tried them all. This mirror will not fog. Do what the instructions tell you and you wont have any problems. Leave the mounting bracket cure for the full 24 hours before mounting the mirror.</li>
    <li> This is my third fogless mirror (two were different than ToiletTree product) and the first one that really performs. Once shower is running and reservoir is filled, the mirror stays clear and the shave is easy. I also like the adjustment feature, and the attaching method is the best of any of the three that I purchased.Very Satisfied!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pricey and the little squeegee does nothing at all.  With that being said its still the very best bathroom mirror I have EVER used.  Love it to death.  Takes only 2 seconds to empty the old water and fill it up with hot water, after that its easy street.  Had this up for 2 years with no issue!  Love it!</li>
    <li> This item was a gift for my bro-in law. He was very happy with this item.</li>
    <li> easy to install, easy to use and easy to clean...&lt;br /&gt;why did i wait so long to purchase one?</li>
    <li> Great product came on time quick</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t even make just the bracket stick to the wall of my shower on the first use. If I could give this product a 0 I would.</li>
    <li> Works well but having to remember to dump the water after filling the tank to help the mirror not condensate is a real pain - instead I just doss it with a spray of shower and it clears right up - it helps to put some RainX type protectant on it to keep it from streaking - I use it daily and find it to be a good quality and sticks well to the shower wall.</li>
    <li> Where has this been all my life?!?!  I have been bearded for the better part of my adult life. The biggest challenge to trimming ones own beard is getting the undersides even on each side. It is like trying to trim your own sideburns (if you have those.) They never seem to come out exactly the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair cutter explained to me that this is due to a retinal/perception issue we all have. I was forever trimming one side of my beard (unintentionally) to be narrower than the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The installation is simple - but requires some patience.  The silicon adhesive takes a full 24 hours to set in the shower. After that, all that is required is filling the removable mirror piece with hot/warm water - this prevents the fogging up.. then, remembering to empty it! The included squeegee actually works perfectly and is held in a slot built into the mirror base -You COULD lose it, but it would be hard!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is now solved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this Fogless Shower Mirror from Toilet Tree Products, my beard is even. I trim it as I shave my neck in the shower. The mirror is ALWAYS clear and I can get within inches of it. I can actually see where I have been missing the mark and am missing it no longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a bearded man&#x27;s dream come true!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: June 20178&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After consistent reliable performance, I bought a second one for another shower stall. They just don&#x27;t make things any better than this!</li>
    <li> i have had this for 3-4 years and works like a charm.  This is the longest lasting, very convenient product I have purchased from many years of being an Amazon customer.  If I needed to replace, I would definitely purchase this exact item again.</li>
    <li> Follow the instructions and it really doesn&#x27;t fog!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had this very long, but in the short time, it has been perfect.  It doesn&#x27;t fog, it&#x27;s easy to put hot water in and not fog up.  The perfect mirror to shave with.</li>
    <li> Great for the shower.  Clear mirror.  Will fog up if you don&#x27;t put in warm shower water from the top of the mirror which is no problem.  Only draw back is if you fill up to the top with water in the back it makes it a little top heavy and if you have it on a shelf instead of attached to the wall it can fall over.  Over all a nice product and great for the price.</li>
    <li> My initial review was that I adored this and the fog free feature. But after some months, it just fell off the wall, though the silicone is still attached to the wall. I have no idea where to get more silicone to repair it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very disappointed because now I feel weird every time I get in the shower without it.</li>
    <li> Mirror works very well, scraper works well,  just got to smat enuf to use the rubber side and not the plastic!</li>
    <li> FINALLY!! A shower mirror that works as advertised. Perfectly clear every time!</li>
    <li> I have had this install for about 6 months now and at first it was great.  I really liked the idea that you fill it with water to keep it warm, it never fogs.  As time went on reflective surface scratched very easily and with water in the mirror the weight was too much and it woudl not stay in position.</li>
    <li> If you follow the instructions, this mirror actually works...better than expected.  My first one is still like new after 3 and a half years (in the home I just sold in WV.)  I just installed my second one here in my new home and seems like they made a couple of improvements in the tilt mechanism and it seems easier to fill.  I have used 8 or 9 competitive products over the previous 30 years and was never satisfied with any of them.  ToiletTree got it right and I&#x27;m just glad I finally found them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Did a lot of research on this and other fogless shower mirrors.  Love this one.  Had it for several weeks now and it&#x27;s great.  Read some of the other complaints about having difficulty putting the mirror back on its base after filling it with water, but to me it&#x27;s very easy and slides right in without having to even look at it.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product over a year ago when I started shaving in the shower. It has held up great and while I have dropped it a few times there is not even so much as a scratch on the mirror portion. The adhesive that is provided worked great and I had no issues removing it when I moved. I had concerns about this as I was living in an apartment and did not want to get charged for any kind of stain or residue left behind. The pedestal is really convenient to keep my razor on and the built in squeegee holder is awesome. I recently moved into a house and found that I had misplaced the additional adhesive that came with the package. I sent an email to customer support asking for more adhesive and they contacted me within 15 minutes and are shipping it to me free of charge. Overall a great product and cheap to boot.</li>
    <li> Great Mirror! Works perfect! Ignore the reviews about &amp;#34;distortion&amp;#34; in the reflection. It&#x27;s extremely negligible at best. I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> First this is a fantastic mirror - works well and does not fog if there is warm or hot water in the container behind.&lt;br /&gt;Its also not a \\&quot;glass\\&quot; mirror so while it wont break, also be careful not to scratch it with a tough pad or powerful cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;So why not 5 stars?&lt;br /&gt;After a year of use - the swivel does not hold any more. With its own weight+ water it swivels down at a useless angle. Having not been on my knees since school, I don&#x27;t plan kneel and shave!&lt;br /&gt;Its stuck well on my wall and now I but a shampoo or shower bottle behind to hold it up...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendation: Buy it only if you plan not to swivel at all or very very limited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope the manufacturers are listening in too to improve their design&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update sept 8 2012 : Got an email from the manufacturer and a replacement swivel part apparently an improved design or material. Updated to 5 stars for excellent customer service.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product!  Stays absolutely fog-free and it&#x27;s very quick and easy to fill and empty the reservoir. Great great mirror!! A+++++</li>
    <li> This is, in my opinion, the best product out there. Foolproof install, and works like a charm. For what more could you ask?</li>
    <li> I got this mirror for my hubby because he, like almost every men, loves shaving in the shower. This mirror is perfect for that! It never fogs and it&#x27;s simple to install and start using it. I got one for my father as well and he loves it too!!!</li>
    <li> I originally had a problem with the adjustable tilt, but I was contacted by ToiletTree and given a replacement part free of charge (amazing customer service). Their mirror no longer has a problem with the adjustable tilt slipping (they updated the product), and is a great buy -- works exactly as advertised :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this item. Finally found a product that does what it says it will do. Directions are to the point but I would have added to squeegee down after use to prevent water spotting. Addendum: After using for two years, I did not clean the mirror portion as instructed &amp; basically ruined it for further use. So I purchased another direct from ToiletTree. The first use of the new mirror &amp; it leaked like a sieve. So I contacted them &amp; rec&#x27;d reply same day indicating that a new mirror portion of the product would be shipped out along with appropriate paperwork to return defective part all at no charge. Later that same day I rec&#x27;d a tracking number for the replacement. That folks, is REAL customer service. They will have my business for any of their products that I can use...</li>
    <li> I have two of these mirrors and they are really good! Easy to install , simple to use. I enjoy using them very much!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many different shower mirrors in the past but this one really works.  The hot water tank keeps the mirror totally fog free regardless of how much steam is in the shower.  Installation was very easy and has thus far been very secure.  The mirror surface is a good size and is distortion free.  The small shelf along the bottom holds a razor with room to spare. I would buy another one no questions asked, in fact I also bought the travel size one as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Been using for about 3 months now.  No change in fog free qualities, this is about the time the fog free coating wears off of other products but not an issue here.  Mounting is still secure.  Have not done anything to clean other than when I fill the tank it gets rinsed off.  I&#x27;ve adjusted the angle slightly and wish I had gotten the LED lit mirror but otherwise still very satisified with this product.</li>
    <li> We have gone through many mirrors, trying to find one that truly didn&#x27;t fog during my husband&#x27;s shaves. This fits the bill! It is easy to install, easy to fill up the reservoir with water (this is why it doesn&#x27;t fog), easy to pivot to the angle you need, and has a handy shelf for a razor. So, why didn&#x27;t I give it four stars? Two reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The price. It&#x27;s hard to justify spending more than fifteen bucks on a shower mirror, but like other products, if it actually works, it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;2) The downside to this being so secure is that it is also very hard to move. We recently PCS&#x27;d and found it very hard to remove the residual adhesive from the shower wall. We haven&#x27;t put it up in our new apartment, but I believe I read in another review that we can use silicone or another type of adhesive to reattach it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d recommend it, simply because it works.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re thinking of getting this product, you should. It is very reasonably priced and high quality. It arrives with a tube of silicone type glue. The back of the bracket shows exactly where to spread the silicone. After positioning it on the wall, you wait 24 hours and then it&#x27;s set.&lt;br /&gt;Using it is easy. You simply fill the reservoir with hot water from the shower. The mirror even includes a squeegee and a place to store the razor.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
    <li> Yes it actually does not fog up and is easy to install. First one I&#x27;ve ever tried which complied with all specifications and was priced  right.I can truly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> An update to my original review which is below. This winter I finally got around to replacing the fogless mirror that failed prematurely as noted in my original review.  I looked online for something similar that would do the job but there really was nothing that had the similar features.  So I reviewed the comments from recent purchasers to see if the problem I had was still an issue.  As noted by many reviews the service at Toiletree was said to be good so I took a chance and emailed them to see what their thoughts were on the mirror that has sat unused glued to my shower for the past ~2 years.  Guess what?  They sent me a new one for free! The new one works great.  It appears that the magnification changed a bit so now I can see a larger field of view.  No issues to date and I am trying to do a better job of remembering to empty the reservoir after I am done.  If this holds up for a year I will update my rating to a 5 star.  Original Review The mirror was great for the first year.  It works as claimed. Add water and it does not fog.  The issue is that if you are like most people you will leave the water in there when you are done. Add more water at the next shower etc.  Having water sitting in the mirror eats the coating off the interior of the mirror.  I do not have hard water so I was surprised that this happened.  At first a line formed near the fill line and now the reflective coating is coming off in places resulting in a blurry and useless mirror.  The only fix would be a new mirror.  Good idea but poor quality on the mirror.</li>
    <li> Great mirror. Solid installation with silicone. Had it about a year and still has not come off, unlike previous models I&#x27;ve tried with suction cups that wear out. Never fogs.</li>
    <li> Mirror works great, stays fog free for the duration of shower. Nice clear reflection. Adjustable angle is nice and the shelf and included squeegee are very handy.</li>
    <li> I have tried three other mirrors, all with suction cups, none of which worked.  This one was easy to attach, it stays put and it does not fog up.  I do not put water in it every time and it still does not fog up.  It is very easy to see when shaving.  I am totally satisfied with this mirror.</li>
    <li> I bought this product not because of its good reviews (well over 4 stars) but because of the 1 and 2 star reviews. If you go and look at them you will see the president of ToiletTree responding in each one offering advice on proper use or replacement parts. This is an owner of a company who cares about his products quality and value and wants his customers happy. Don&#x27;t take my word for it. Open up a new tab and read the reviews yourself. This company is willing to do whatever it takes to make you happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on to the product. I put it up yesterday. Quick and easy instructions. This morning I took a shower and was able to shave by looking at the fogless mirror (you must fill it with warm/hot water I the shower first). Works as advertised and if it doesn&#x27;t I am 100% confident that ToiletTree will do whatever it can to fix it.</li>
    <li> We have tried many shower mirrors over the years.  This one works exactly as advertised, looks good in our shower, and is simple to install.  Very, very happy after being disappointed over time with others.  And all at a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve had shower mirrors before that work well because they had the reservoir for water, but they suctioned cupped to the wall.  And eventually fell down in the middle of the night and scared us to death.  I love how this one has adhesive.  Plus, it looks really nice.  The shelf and squeegee are a nice plus.</li>
    <li> Received on time, installed easy and works like it said. For men who shave in the shower this is the one to get. I have used several of the other brands but this one has been the best.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly.  Installed easily.  Using for about two months now.  No issues.  Very happy with this product.  I would definitely buy from this company again.</li>
    <li> Well, I just got this mirror and I have to say the item is as described except for one SMALL issue. Installation instruction says that the included adhesive silicone should be used in its entirety. However, the included tube was old and three quarter dried out. So basically there was almost nothing left to be used. I had to use pliers to squeeze the last drop of the silicone. I didn&#x27;t put the mirror on the wall yet since the instruction tells you to leave the bracket to dry for 24hrs. I hope it won&#x27;t fall since I only used a bit of silicone and included two sided tape. Apart from that, seems like a good product. I took one star off because of the silicone issue and another star because delivery took longer than expected.</li>
    <li> I purchased one of these and I can honestly say that once you fill the back it is completely fog free.  However, the company sent me a silicone tube that was cracked and half dried up.  I used what was left but of course that is not nearly enough and the entire mirror fell and broke.  I returned the mirror and received my refund.  I am considering buying another to try it with ALL the silicone, hope that I don;t get another dried up tube.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item and had high expectations considering the good reviews....unfortunately the glue that comes with it was so hard i could not get it out of the tube, so basically this mirror is sitting in a drawer wasting space. If i could rate it no stars i would have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: shortly after posting my review, the nice folks at the ToiletTree got in touch with me offering to replace the glue. I receive the replacement so quickly (i think the first glue was defective maybe because of the very cold weather...). I was able to put up the mirror and i enjoy using it now. I cannot say that it does not fog at all because it does (a lot), but it is a decent bathroom mirror.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about two weeks and so far it has met and exceeded my expectations. Installation was very easy using the included tube of acrylic gel and two sticky pads. The squeegee is nice as well, since water gets on the mirror surface during filling of the reservoir. The shelf under the mirror is also well-thought out. My razor FINALLY has its own place, so I always know where it is in the shower. Overall, I am happy with my purchase and would suggest this product to anyone who wants to shave in the shower. Plus, my wife doesn&#x27;t get mad at me for leaving a watery mess around the sink in the morning after shaving!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t always leave product reviews, but given that I have had many shower mirrors over the years that have been garbage I felt it was important I write this one. I have had several standard coated mirrors over the years (the type available at stores like Bed Bath &amp; Beyond). However, the coating tends to wear out quickly eliminating the fog-free functionality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The concept of having hot water behind the mirror is really the only way to effectively create a truly fog-free mirror. I had purchased another, cheaper one in the past, which worked OK but found that the suction cup wouldn&#x27;t stick to the shower wall for very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In contrast, the backing for this mirror adheres to the shower wall with a combination of double sided tape and removable silicone (which you do need to let dry for 12 hours). I have only had this for 1 week, but so far so good. It sticks to the wall, stays fog free, and includes a built-in squeegee to wipe water droplets away (which is better than running under the shower stream). Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone over any other shower mirror on the market. Don&#x27;t waste money on cheaper alternatives.</li>
    <li> I want two things from this product.  One is that is doesn&#x27;t fog.  Other is that it stays on the wall.  (i.e. doesn&#x27;t fall off after time and or with the slightest jostle).  You get both of these plus a nice unexpected third feature. Simple but brilliant design does the trick.  First is silicone gel that comes with it.  Use that to get good purchase on tiles. I have had it for almost a year.  Still on the shower wall.  No sign of coming off.  The second is the simple reservoir that you fill with hot shower water. This makes the mirror the same temperature as the shower environment so no fogging.  Now the finishing touch.  When ready to shave, you use the perfectly designed built squeegee to clean off the mirror.  Perfect.</li>
    <li> Huge mirror and no fog! What more can you ask for in a fogless mirror? It tilts, has a shelf for my razor and is easy to remove and replace when filling with water. It&#x27;s a very ingenious design. After going through over a dozen fog-free mirrors in my lifetime, this is definitely my favorite!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other fog less mirrors to no avail, but this one works exactly as advertised. It&#x27;s simple, really, and doesn&#x27;t fail. The included squeegee is key, and the shelf below the mirror is great to store it and a razor.</li>
    <li> It was entirely my fault. I did not read the description thoroughly, and didn&#x27;t notice that it did not magnify. Since I can&#x27;t see in the shower , I need this feature.</li>
    <li> easy to install and works as advertised! What more can you want!</li>
    <li> Just what I needed. I used industrial strength two sided tape and it is solid to the wall. Works great.</li>
    <li> Product works as one would expect. Do not attach the mirror to the stand right after you have stuck the stand to the shower wall! You must let the glue dry for 24 hours before adding the weight of the mirror to it! VERY IMPORTANT, OTHERWISE IT WILL BREAK OFF</li>
    <li> True to it&#x27;s name and description, the mirror works because of its unique water reservoir. Mounts easily and securely.</li>
    <li> Moved home and re-ordered it. Love it!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  Does exactly what it says.  Before this I had a mirror that was supposed to be fogless and it definitely was not.  This one is so simple, just fill with warm water and that&#x27;s it.  Highly recommend this mirror.</li>
    <li> Excellent shower mirror....does&#x27;nt  fog up at all when following hot water instuctions.</li>
    <li> This mirror really remains clear and does not fog up. Bought it last week. Everything is working perfectly so far!</li>
    <li> Excellent Product.  We even purchased a second to have on hand because my husband loves it. (for an extra just in case)</li>
    <li> Product is performing as advertised so far (less than a week in use)- no fog when used as advertised. But, there wasn&#x27;t any \\&quot;usable\\&quot; adhesive either. When installing the product to your shower wall, you are instructed to use the enclosed tube of silicone adhesive to attach the mounting bracket to the wall.  We did have a tube of adhesive, but it was all dried up.  Luckily, we had similar adhesive on hand that could be used instead.  I&#x27;m sure had we contacted the company, a replacement tube would have been sent to us.  But by using our own, we didn&#x27;t have to wait to use the product that we had purchased.  So, shout out to ToiletTree....check your packages &amp; make sure your adhesive is usable!!</li>
    <li> At first when my husband started using this product it was perfect, just like he had been looking for a long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The solution to keep the mirror fog free with hot water in the back is very clever but....... after some months using it, the friction lock has broken and the mirror only can be used in down position because it can&#x27;t stand the weight of the water in its back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems that the structure that supports the weight is very fragile and is supposed to break with the daly use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> Works great No fog The only suggestion would be bigger place to put razors maybe something on the side to hold them up right</li>
    <li> I have only had a chance to use it twice, but so far it is as advertised.  Product is very sturdy and has no issues staying up and it doesn&#x27;t fog up at all while I&#x27;m using it for shaving.  Definitely a must have for anyone that wants to actually SEE themselves in the shower.</li>
    <li> Be generous in your application of the silicon adhesive.  It fell off the first time I mounted it after about 2-3 months.  The side that came off was actually on the mirror itself so I scratched up the back before putting more adhesive on it and mounting it again.  It&#x27;s been on for over a year now without issue.  I may need to replace it due to hard water issues here, but that&#x27;s my problem and not a problem with the product.  I&#x27;d definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> The product works fine!  The price is excessive! Compared to other similar products,  It should be about 1/3 of what it is!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> The item arrived promptly and works better than expected.  I&#x27;ve had a number of \\&quot;fog less\\&quot; mirrors in the past.  This was the only one that really was.</li>
    <li> After 6-month of use, it&#x27;s hard to keep the angle of the mirror. I guess the plastic hinge at the back of the mirror worn out and it doesn&#x27;t hold the mirror when it&#x27;s loaded with water. What a disappointment for a product like this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 Month Later;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my review, company contacted with me and sent a replacement part in a week. So far I am pleased with the replacement.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of weeks now and it works just like it says. Go no further. This is the mirror you&#x27;ve search for. A true fog less. It&#x27;ll be last fog less you&#x27;ll ever buy unless its this one.</li>
    <li> This mirror is awesome! I&#x27;ve had it for almost 2 yrs and it&#x27;s still hanging strong and it still looks good and works as it should..great!! Definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a reliable shower mirror. I read lots of reviews before I purchased and I&#x27;m so happy I ultimately chose this one!</li>
    <li> My grandson said it works great</li>
    <li> Worked better than I thought it would. Clarity of reflective surface is like glass. Installed in less than five minutes</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m rating this a 5 because it still hasn&#x27;t let me down.  I&#x27;ve had this for over a year now and it is great.  It doesn&#x27;t fog when filled with hot water, the squeegee works great and as long as you don&#x27;t mind gluing this to your tile inside your shower, it will never fall down.  The tilt feature works great.  It&#x27;s no problem removing from the bracket to fill with water, or clean.  The tray/ledge for the razor is great. The size is great too.  Buy this, you&#x27;ll be happy. It&#x27;s nice not hearing my old suction cup ones crash to the ground.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I like to shave in the shower.  This product works great.  I have owned other \\&quot;fog-less\\&quot; mirrors, they were all crap for lack of a better word.  This mirror is easy to hang and is perfect if you are a shower shaver.  The mirror tilts up and down and has a shelf to hold your razor as well as a squeegee.  You just fill the back part when you start your shower with warm water and it stays clear the entire time.</li>
    <li> My biggest worry was that the shower mirror would not stay put on the wall but this hasn&#x27;t so much as moved since it was adhered. The only way the mirror could be improved is with a few lights on the side as our shower can be a bit dark in the morning.</li>
    <li> Great product! No fogging and very easy to use. Only takes seconds to fill with water and replace and it is fog free. Would certainly buy again.</li>
    <li> Have had no problems with the mirror. And my husband loves it, and we have been through almost every mirror out there</li>
    <li> Why didn&#x27;t I think of this?  Very simple and very effective.  Easy to install</li>
    <li> Works exactly as advertised. Never fogs. Awesome. I can now shave in the shower without worrying about missing spots.  Good</li>
    <li> Product works as advertised provided you fill the container behind the mirror. Able to put on a corner shelf in the shower without having to adhere it to the tile. Just left the squeegee on the bottom and tilted to the wall.</li>
    <li> Love it!  works fine.  No fog ever.</li>
    <li> Wish the squeegee was built in so it would be easy to slide side to side. I hate having to slide it out , swipe 3-4 times then return to holder.&lt;br /&gt;I have no other complaints.</li>
    <li> bought for my husband, who found it easy to install, and easy to use, he loves it!</li>
    <li> Works great and stays put. Just read the directions to keep it fogless.</li>
    <li> Finally a shower mirror that does what it says.  I bought this fogless mirror and have to say it actually works. To prevent fogging you need fill the mirrors reservoir with hot water. Also, since I mounted the mirror 2 months ago I&#x27;ve had no problems with it coming down. The adhesive is silicone glue which is very durable... follow the directions and you too will rate it 5 stars...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking around for a good shower mirror for several months. I&#x27;ve been shaving in the shower for many years without a mirror because like some of the other reviews mentioned they wouldn&#x27;t stay on the wall with the suction cups.    This one has a bracket which attaches to the wall with provided silicone adhesive. The mirror along with a resevoir for warm shower water slides into the bracket. The mirror stays fog free and comes with a squeegee to clear the water droplets.    This would be a good gift for anyone who shaves in the shower.</li>
    <li> The mirror does what it claims to do. I do believe the mirror is a good purchase and does save time. Would I purchase the mirror again? Yes! In my opinion, the pros far outweigh the cons. The pros and cons below are just the facts from my viewpoint!    Pros:   The mirror does not fog up.  If the directions are followed, the mirror will not fall.  Squeegee works well.  Excellent customer service with the company in case you have any problems. They make every effort to make you happy.  May save time when shaving as compared to shaving in front of the sink after a shower.    Cons:  Once the back of the mirror is filled with water, it could be a little difficult to line up the slot to put the mirror back on the holder. (An option might be to keep a cup in the shower and fill the mirror while it is still hanging)  Placement of the mirror may be a challenge. I have placed the mirror in two locations and it still gets water on it while I shave.  Size of the mirror is small (if you only shave your face it is fine; but for those who shave your head it could be a little larger).  Price. Compared to other mirrors, this one costs more. I have not used other mirrors so I have no comparison of the quality of the other mirrors.</li>
    <li> This is a really cool invention! It has made my shaving routine much more convenient. No more wiping down mirrors to get 10 seconds of shave time and then having to repeat the same step. Molding it to your shower wall is extremely easy. I don&#x27;t know how I lived without the Shower Mirror!</li>
    <li> just as advertised. i have had several over the years. this is by far the best. i would recommend this after just a week in use</li>
    <li> Having just designed and built a walk-in shower and looking for a suitable fogless shaving mirror, I gave this product a trial.  It works just as advertised, doesn&#x27;t waste water and is a high quality mirror.  It mounts solidly without damaging the wall and is easy to keep clean and clear.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item based on other amazon reviews. It works as advertised. Note, you must fill the reservoir w/ warm/hot water to activate the fogless feature. The support frame requires &#x27;gluing&#x27; it to your shower w/ sticky pads and silicone caulk. Not sure how easy it will be to remove. But, in the final analysis, it is fogless so you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> The fog less mirror from ToiletTree is a good purchase and works well for me. I was pleased with the design and the fact that you could detach the mirror from the base. However, my only problem was that the adhesive silicone that came in the package was dry and could not be used to attached the mirror to the wall. So, I had to purchase silicone separately just to attach the mirror.</li>
    <li> I just received this mirror and it works like a charm.  I haven&#x27;t used the silicone to attach it to the wall, as I will be moving soon, so I can&#x27;t verify the \\&quot;does not fall\\&quot; claim, but I don&#x27;t doubt that it will work just fine.  The only drawback with this method of attachment vs. the suction cups is that you can&#x27;t move it around whenever you want.  I&#x27;m currently using the suction cup attachment from my previous mirror that I scratched up cleaning with a rough brush.  I won&#x27;t make that mistake again.  There&#x27;s a handy squeegee that comes with this mirror too to keep off the water spots.</li>
    <li> This Fogless shower Mirror worked GREAT in our house!  It was really easy to install.  We have been using it for about a week now! I would have to say that I am vey pleased.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any film or rust build up around it, like I was scared I might.    I let my husband install it.  He didn&#x27;t have one complaint.  He did mention it was easy to install!  This is great coming from him!!!      We have both used it.  It is really easy to use.  You just fill the reservoir with water and the mirror doesn&#x27;t fog.  You have to be careful when you fill it, that you don&#x27;t get the mirror wet.  If it does get wet, it comes with a squeegee to wipe it off the water.    I like the mirror because I think it looks good in our tub!  It is also a great size.  I can actually see my face in it, instead of just part of my face!  I think men will find it easy to shave without having to dirty up the bathroom sink!</li>
    <li> Okay perhaps a bit of an editorial, but hey this is my review! I was always annoyed when I got out of the shower only to find that the mirror in the bathroom was foggy from the nice shower I just had. Sure, I could wipe off the mirror, but within moments it would refog -- perhaps my wife was now taking a shower and reducing my humility while adding some more humidity to the situation, or perhaps my shower was just so hot that there was still some left over steam that was making its way to the mirror.  Nevertheless I would get my little sliver of the mirror prepared for the expedition into the land of shaving only to find that the razor was missing, of course in the shower because my wife decided she wanted to borrow it for her legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This fantastic mirror, now mounted in the shower, has an excellent ledge that has become the perminant home of my razor, it never gets foggy (because the mirror is the same temperature as the water vapor so there is no condensation on that surface). If you are thinking, hey let me get one of those cheaper mirrors that sticks in my shower, don&#x27;t.  This one is the way to go, it really is as good as they say! (Even if it&#x27;s because now you&#x27;ll always know where your razor is)</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he loves it. It does exactly what he needed it to. It really doesnt fog up....its awesome.  The little shelf is great too. Great buy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s TWO years later and I&#x27;m amazed at how awesome this shower mirror for shaving really is.  As an update to those interested--this is THE one to get. Period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave in the shower everyday and I wanted a fogless mirror that would be mostly fog free and wouldn&#x27;t keep crashing to the shower floor every few days because of crappy suction cups.  Well, this shower mirror is the ONLY one to get.  It stays mostly fog free, sticks on the wall GREAT, and comes with a little squeegee to wipe the mirror clean.  If you shave everyday and want an item that truly works, this shower mirror is it.</li>
    <li> I have only praise. I got this because I didn&#x27;t want the hubby to shave over the sink and leave hair everywhere. After reading the reviews for all similar products on Amazon, I went with this anti-fog mirror based on the praise for the company&#x27;s customer service and the product itself. This product did exactly as advertised--it sticks on the shower wall like white on rice; it&#x27;s anti-fog; and it&#x27;s simple. 2 thumbs up.</li>
    <li> We re. Rey pleased with the purchase of the toiletree fog free shaving mirror. Shipping/receiving time was very prompt and the product is well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and makes getting ready for work a lot more efficient.  Works as advertised and recommend this if you want to shave in the shower.</li>
    <li> First of all, it stays fog free and stays stuck to the wall, so it suits my needs.  I took a star away only because it&#x27;s not always easy to place the mirror back on the bracket after filling it.  Also, it would be nice if the water slowly drained on its own so you don&#x27;t have to remember to empty the reservoir after each use.  All in all, I would recommend it.  I&#x27;ve tried the traditional style fog free mirrors that just dont work after a while, and I&#x27;ve tried the type that go inline with the plumbing.  In terms of functionality, I like the ones that go inline the best, but they don&#x27;t last forever so I figured I would give this a try since it was so highly rated.</li>
    <li> This product works exactly like it&#x27;s supposed to work -- an amazing concept in today&#x27;s marketplace!  The unit is easy to attach to the shower wall and does actually stay FOG-FREE for my entire shower.  I love that the mirror is adjustable too.  Since I first discovered shaving in the shower many years ago,  I&#x27;ll bet I have tried 10+ different types of shower shaving mirrors, and the ToiletTree Fogless Shower Mirror is undoubtedly the best!</li>
    <li> This mirror is exactly as promised!  I love it! There is a slight distortion in the image, but its actually somewhat of a magnification so that is totally acceptable.  Do not use any abrasives to clean it, and follow all the installation instructions, and you are good to go!  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Rec&#x27;d as a gift from my wife and kids. I&#x27;ve tried more than a dozen so called fogless shaving mirrors over the years. They fogged up or they fell off the wall or both. Not so with this mirror! I was skeptical at first but now I&#x27;m a believer. The mirror is awesome, so simple yet genius. Need to shave in the shower and want a real deal fogless shower mirror? Buy this mirror. You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> Dont waste your money this things is useless - fogs up immediately - cheap materials - not worth the money - actually not worth any money</li>
    <li> If you currently rent and can not use double sided tape to hang anything, this product may not be right for you.  I gave it **see below** stars because it LOOKS like it will be a good product if you&#x27;re able to use double sided tape that we all know is very difficult to remove.  It does use removable silicone adhesive to secure the mirror to the wall as advertised, but it uses double sided tape to hold the mirror in place while the silicone gel sets.  This should have been acknowledged in the product description.  The mirror is well packaged and looks like it will work well as long as you remember that you&#x27;ll have to empty the reservoir and re-fill it with hot water every time you use it.  It has a bunch of small holes along the top side and my first thought was that it will take some time to get the dispersed shower spray to eventually fill the reservoir through those holes.    If you don&#x27;t mind using double sided tape, then try the product... it might work well.  If you don&#x27;t like or can&#x27;t use double sided tape, then try another product.  Good luck!  UPDATE:  I still ended up returning this product, so I can&#x27;t provide any actual usage feedback.  The double-sided tape is still a concern given my rental situation.  What I can tell you is that the manufacturers of this mirror really stand behind it.  I had received an email from Director of Marketing as a normal follow up to my purchase.  Since I had just published my review, I responded to let them know my concerns about the tape.  I received several email responses from the President directly letting me know the tape has been well tested and would come off easily, and also suggesting another way I could secure the mirror.  He also promised to update the listing to be more clear about the use of tape.    I initially gave this product 2 stars... because it wouldn&#x27;t work for me and the description didn&#x27;t make that clear up front.  I&#x27;ve upped it to 4 stars.  I can&#x27;t tell you if it really works.  I&#x27;ve left the title of the review the same: potential customers should know it needs tape for the mounting process.  But if every manufacturer showed the same care and concern for both its products and its customers we&#x27;d all be much happier.  This product may not work for my situation, but I won&#x27;t hesitate to try any of their other products that do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned just about every fogless mirror ever produced, and this is the only one that truly works.  By far, the best fogless mirror out there!  Buy it!</li>
    <li> Finally a truly fogless shower mirror. Instals super easy and stays in place. At the start of your shower just fill the mirror with warm water and it stays fogless the whole time. As someone who does all their shaving in the shower it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This is the best shower mirror I have ever used. Just don&#x27;t forget to put hot water  in the back of the miirror.</li>
    <li> The fogless mirror works great providing the reservoir is filled with warm water otherwise it will fog up.  We have two shower heads in our shower so once the water is warm I turn on the second shower head near the mirror and fill the reservior with warm water.</li>
    <li> I have had one of these mirrors at my second home for a few years. When I needed a new mirror at my primary home, I got another. This is the only mirror that I have ever found that is truly fog free. Easy to use and truly works. Great seller also.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve looked around quite a bit, and by far this is the best product in this category I have found to date. Delivery was prompt and installation was easy. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror, the adhesive and installation are a breeze and is very sturdy.  I like the concept of how the mirror works and is very user friendly.  I will be putting these in all the showers.</li>
    <li> I had a couple different shower mirrors over the years, all of which failed to work as promised.  This product works great and exactly as expected.  I won&#x27;t rant on how great it is, because there are plenty of posts for that.  I wanted to share with anybody that uses the mirror that all you have to do is line the mirror with warm/hot water from the shower, you don&#x27;t need to fill it up all the way.  I just spray the inside of the shower mirror with shower water before I shave and it stays clear long enough for me to shave.  I found filling it all the way up wasn&#x27;t necessary.  It makes it easier to handle when hanging it back on its stand.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror.  No more worrying about a mirror falling down and breaking.  And once filled with water, it never fogs up.  I also like how big it is!  Fits my big &#x27;ole face in the whole picture.</li>
    <li> I have used many \\&quot;fogless\\&quot;shower mirrors over the years. I can honestly say that this one is the only TRUE fogless shower mirror out of the bunch! All of the information stated about this product is legitimate. This one is the one to get!</li>
    <li> The first shower mirror that really doesn&#x27;t fog up. And so far, it hasn&#x27;t fallen down, like those with suction cups do. The little squeegee is a nice touch too. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Finally a fogless mirror that is really fogless! Easy set up, just follow the directions. Fill with warm shower water and start shaving! I have purchased numerous fogless mirrors over the years and this one is the BEST!</li>
    <li> The Mirror is stylish, and easy to install, But as soon as the hot water goes on, the mirror fogs up. you can clear it easely with the mirror wipe, but by the time you put the wipe back in the sleeve, it&#x27;s fogged up again. That&#x27;s it!</li>
    <li> You get your product. You fill the opening with warm water from the shower and you see that it actually does what it is supposed to do. So you are happy and rate this product 5 stars. I could have rated 5 stars as soon as I got it but never did. I bought 2 mirrors by the way. I always wait a certain time before rating a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is very good but after 4 or 6 months the plastic hinge which rotates the mirror becomes weak and therefore you are no longer able to put the mirror in a desirable way e.g. for shaving because the plastic hinge weakens over time usually within 4 or 6 months, and this happened to my 2 mirrors I bought. Yes, indeed your mirror doesn&#x27;t fall and doesn&#x27;t fog but the hinge become weak over time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 12/21/2012&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to say \\&quot;thank you\\&quot; to Steve the president of ToiletTree Products. Apparently, I had an older version of the mirror hinges and he sent me two new hinges for my existing mirrors. The problem has been resolved now and my mirrors feel so much stronger now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rate this product 5 out of 5. It is so nice to have the president of ToiletTree Products addressing my issues personally and fix them. That is customer service! Thank you.</li>
    <li> Fogless...yay and that is all one really needs to know.  Adding more words as the review requires it...okay need one more.</li>
    <li> I received my mirror as a gift about two years ago. The mirror has survived two moves in that time. Recently, one side of the bracket broke (the piece that the mirror slides into). The break was not a manufacturing defect, but rather the result of a frantic grasp to prevent a fall in the shower. Taking full responsibility for the break, I contacted the manufacturer to see if I could order a new bracket. Without a hiccup, the manufacturer offered to send me a new bracket (as well as new wall mounting silicone and adhesives) free of charge. I was floored by such great service. It&#x27;s really refreshing to have a great service experience with a manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the product itself, I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it. It works as advertised. The only drawback might be the lack of a light for a darker shower, but I see that they offer an LED version as well. I don&#x27;t know what else a person might need.  Overall, this is a great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this mirror for three days now, and I&#x27;m thrilled that it works as advertised. The \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; mechanism is pretty clever: The mirror has a reservoir in the back of it that holds warm water from your shower, which equalizes the temperature on both sides and prevents condensation from forming. The mirror itself easily slides on and off the mounting bracket, so it just takes a second to fill up the back with hot water and slide it back onto the bracket. No chemicals, oils or special coatings needed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read another review that complained about it not adhering to the wall. Although it&#x27;s only been a few days so far, it seems to be holding very tightly. The mirror comes with a tube of removable epoxy and provides clear instructions on how to adhere it to the wall. It seems pretty foolproof as long as you follow the instructions and let it sit overnight so that the adhesive can set. I haven&#x27;t yanked hard on it, but it seems to me mounted tightly enough on the tile wall of my shower that it would take some extensive prying and pulling to get it off.</li>
    <li> I decided to start shaving in the shower (softer beard, closer shave, easier to rinse...). To do this, I was going to need an anti-fog shower mirror.  One that REALLY works. This mirror does the job perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before turning on the shower, I run the sink faucet until it&#x27;s warm to hot. I then take the mirror off it&#x27;s mount, fill the reservoir behind the mirror, and then place it back onto the mount. Throughout the entire shower, the mirror stays perfectly clear and fog-free!  I can easily shave in the shower now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent fogless shower mirror that works great every time!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased other shower mirrors from Amazon in the past that ended up being much smaller than what I pictured and/or connecting to the wall weakly resulting in falls with a full basin.  This thing is different - very sturdy and a nice, large mirror.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> Was that a joke? Fogless?  ha ha ha ha.  It was fogless for around 10 seconds.  maybe it&#x27;s fogless if you shower with really cold water.  This one did not work. It fogs all the time. sorry. ;-(</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for Christmas and apparently, after reading the reviews here, my boyfriend did not follow the instructions as the mirror fogs up immediately when you turn on the shower. I&#x27;ll  write another review after he fills the reservoir with water to see how this product actually performs...I can tell you that it&#x27;s very sleek and manly and it hasn&#x27;t fallen off the shower wall yet, so that&#x27;s 2 positives..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To follow up...once my boyfriend filled the reservoir with water, it worked perfectly and he is quite pleased with himself and the mirror!</li>
    <li> Finally I found a fantastic fogless mirror for the shower.  Been using the cheap things that use a coated plastic for a mirror for years.&lt;br /&gt;Hated every one of them.  Saw this one at Amazon so I thought I would try it.  No regrets whatsoever.  Works just as they say.  Easy to fill&lt;br /&gt;with hot water, easy to empty, and it&#x27;s even made with a regular mirror.  No distortion in the reflection.  It even mounts to the shower wall&lt;br /&gt;without suction cups.  If you shave in the shower and are tired of the cheap so called fogless mirrors, don&#x27;t hesitate, buy this one.</li>
    <li> I gave this to someone as a gift and it works great. I chose it over the newer version because of the ability to tilt the mirror up and down. The size is more than enough to be useful.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this mirror! Bought it for my husband for Christmas. No problems at all and it STAYS on the wall!! Installation was a breeze. Loved the price and loved the product!! I would recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> After going to bed, bath and beyond and several other stores over the last few years and picking up $40-$60 shower shaving mirrors here and there, and always being disappointed, I thought \\&quot;why not try amazon and see if they have something different.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The suction style and the type that mount on your shower head never really worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the reviews I gave this a shot and I think I have found a winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When mounting it, I took a my small level ([[ASIN:B00067F5M0 Empire em81.9 True Blue 9-Inch Heavy-duty Magnetic Aluminum Torpedo Level]]) and made sure the mounting plate was level when I mounted it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left it alone for about 30 hours before I put the mirror on and tested it out... and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I were to add any additional features, I would like more of a magnification in the mirror, so I could notice if I missed any small neck hairs and also maybe a spot for some shaving cream. I wont take those factors into rating this item though because i knew it didn&#x27;t have them when I bought it, so I can&#x27;t hold it against it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only real gripe with it is that the squeegee it comes with is like 1/8 of an inch to small... so it doesn&#x27;t wipe the whole glass on one swipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This mirror is great! I have had several others that always fogged up and usually fell off the wall but this one works perfectly and I could not be happier that I bought it.</li>
    <li> I purchased 2 mirrors for my husband (one for his shower and one for the motorhome shower). He absolutely LOVES them!&lt;br /&gt;He has tried several shower mirrors in the past, but this one is by far the best! I&#x27;m ordering one now for his buddy&lt;br /&gt;for his birthday. We know he will love it, too! I cannot begin to explain what a great product this is. Try it &amp; I&lt;br /&gt;guarantee you that you will be totally satisfied. I wish they had a product like this with a magnifying mirror for&lt;br /&gt;ladies to shave their legs!!!</li>
    <li> The mirror performs just as described, BUT the swivel mechanism failed after about 2 months of use. My wife is shorter than I am and she uses it to see her face while showering. After many times of her pulling the mirror downward so she can view her face, it no longer stays up with water in the reservoir. Therefore it is useless for me to shave with unless I hold it with one hand and shave with the other, which is what I currently do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK mirror, just does not hold up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had plenty of fog free shower mirrors over the years, but this is the first one that you add hot water to in order to keep it fog free.  It is quick to add the water while you are in the shower and the mirror stays fog free.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband.  Works well.  Came on time.  My husband is pleased with it.  It does fog up; but it comes with a squeegie that cleans it off and takes the fog away.  Best shower mirror he has had so far.</li>
    <li> The product was impressive for the first few weeks until the mechanism that holds the mirror in position started to give out. After that the gear would not hold the mirror up at all, making it useless.</li>
    <li> It works great. It&#x27;s clear as long as you fill the reservoir up with hot water. I can finally shave in the shower and save time doing so. Love that. It is a lil&#x27; over priced since it&#x27;s made out of almost all plastic. Overall, great product.</li>
    <li> Has been using it since cristmas and he says its great,has to remember to empty and refill it,but our shower is in the basement and the temps vary a great deal.it stays clear!!!</li>
    <li> This is truly a great product. Doesn&#x27;t fog up. Had trouble with the adjustable swivel and ordered another mirror after a couple years. Called the company and they sent a replacement part free (improved model) and said send back the second mirror. This will take care of the problem. So I&#x27;m returning the second one and praising this company who stands behind their product. Highly recommend this product and company.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about two weeks and am very happy with the performance.  Filling it up with water each day seemed like a bit of a drag, but it&#x27;s not bad and the results are great.  Not a complaint, but future design enhancement suggestions would include: 1) making the shape of the mirror a bit more vertical and 2) having space to store more than 1 razor (wife has now lost her spot).</li>
    <li> Absolutely squared away product. Easy instructions. Durable. Preforms as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are in the market for a shower mirror don&#x27;t waste your time looking just buy this model.</li>
    <li> Received on time and very good packaging by the seller and amazon. Items in real life are smaller than seen on the web and that is expected. However the mirror size is very good. Installing the bracket took about a minute but then you have to wait 24 hours for it to dry. The finish of the product is perfect and very good material (bracket and mirror). Make sure you fully installation instructions thoroughly.</li>
    <li> When I first bought this mirror, I was under the impression that it didn&#x27;t work.  However, you must follow the directions!  It will not fog if you follow the directions and fill it with water as directed.  It really is fogless!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 58 years old and can&#x27;t remember how many of these Shower type Mirrors I have bought in the past.  THIS is the ONLY I have ever owned that works!!  Kudos an HIGH FIVE to a Company that&#x27;s product DOES WHAT THEY SAY!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REVISED- I am now 60 years old and this continues to be the VERY BEST I have ever owned. I mounted it on the wall opposite from the shower head and I&#x27;m telling you it still looks new and DOES THE JOB IT&#x27;S SUPPOSED TO DO!!  KUDOS and HIGH TEN!!</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS A RIP OFF!! The swivel for the mirror broke within one month, and the mirror fell off my shower wall in the middle of the night. I used both adhesives that came in the box. And the light is worthless.</li>
    <li> 3 weeks into it and I have to say that if you follow the instructions, it works as advertised.  Clear image and no distortion as noted in some other reviews.</li>
    <li> The toilet tree fogless shower mirror works better than any of the shower mirrors I have had over the years.  Installation was easy and appears to be quite sturdy.  The shelf at the bottom is very handy.  Only drawback is the size.  It&#x27;s smaller than what I had thought it would be, but does not detract greatly from the overall satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After using for about six months, the mirror finish has started to flake off.  It&#x27;s still usable, but not the final answer for a shower mirror.</li>
    <li> I originally rated this 5 stars when I first got it.  After a couple of months the mirror is worthless!  They should have designed this better.  I like the idea but the execution is not there!  It is like trying to shave in a fun house mirror!  I am going to have to break down and buy a different mirror!</li>
    <li> This is greater product. I&#x27;ve been a long-term shave-in-the-shower guy. I recently moved and the suction cups of my previous mirror did not adhere to the less than perfectly smooth surface. The silicone adhesive works really well. The mirror is easy to fill and replace. Zero fog.  Time will tell as most shower mirrors start out great then deteriorate. But with the innovative design seems like this one will last.</li>
    <li> Best fogless mirrow I have owned and I have tried several different brands and models before this product, would recommend.</li>
    <li> The dial that allows you to adjust the angle of the mirror was faulty, but the company replaced it for me. Works great.</li>
    <li> This think stayed cloudy and kept fogging up. It wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
    <li> At first the mirror didn&#x27;t work for me but I was contacted by someone at the company who urged me to give it another try and FILL THE MIRROR WITH HOT WATER.  Amazing what happens when you take the time and follow the directions. It works great and I love using it.</li>
    <li> I decided to start shaving in the shower to save time and hopefully get an easier, smoother shave from the hot water. The only problem is obviously finding a mirror that doesn&#x27;t fog. After searching around a bit, I found this one and another smaller mirror on amazon both with nearly 5 stars. Both of them seemed like good mirrors and I like the fact that they are based on science rather than some magical pixy dust that gets rid of fog. The idea is that if you keep both sides of the mirror the same temperature, it won&#x27;t fog. The other mirror required that you run it under the hot water to remove the fog. I was a little worried about how long it would last, and liked the idea of \\&quot;filling\\&quot; up this mirror to hopefully keep it fog free for longer. This one also includes a nice little shelf, a squeege, and silicon for attaching to wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+Attaches to wall with silicon (no suction cups!) - no worries it will fall off in the middle of the night&lt;br /&gt;+Lots of extras - little shelf, squeege, etc&lt;br /&gt;+Great instructions and simple setup&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Rather expensive as compared with other mirrors, but I figured if I use it everyday might as well get a nice one&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, highly recommended if shaving in the shower is your thing (which it should be!) Will update review if necessary.</li>
    <li> This mirror worked great for 4 months.  It definitely does not fog when you fill it with hot water.  Unfortunately, over (a short period of) time, the notches to hold the mirror in position wear.  When you hang the mirror you can adjust how much it&#x27;s tilted towards or away from you.  It only took six months for the notches to wear so much, that when the mirror is now filled completely with hot water, it cannot stay in position and falls forward because it&#x27;s too heavy for the worn notches.  Since the fourth month (it&#x27;s now the 8th) we have had to add less and less water to the mirror so the mirror was less and less heavy, so it would stay in position.  With less water, the mirror isn&#x27;t completely fogless.  In just six months it has gotten to the point where the mirror will not stay in any position at all anymore, no matter how little water / how light, so it completely bends forward and shows you your feet and not your face. I have resorted to \\&quot;wedging\\&quot; our tub stopper behind the mirror and against the wall, so it won&#x27;t fall forward and keep it&#x27;s position. It&#x27;s a flimsy solution but it works ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 10/24/2012:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The president of the company saw my review and contacted me and sent me a new piece which resolves this issue.  It was really easy to snap off the old piece and snap on the new one.  Now the mirror works perfectly again.  He said they were aware of this issue and that the pieces are manufactured differently now which avoid this problem.  I am very impressed with this company and highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> Simply fill the mirror with warm/hot shower water and voila, no fog. What a simple solution to a fog-free shower mirror. Why can&#x27;t I think of things like this? :)) Very easy to install. I used 3M Command Water-Resistant strips to install on a glass shower wall rather than the semi-permanentt glue that comes in the box. The mirror is just the right size and works as advertised.</li>
    <li> I love this for shaving in the shower. Follow the directions on how to use the mirror and you are good to go. I&#x27;ve never had issues with the mount coming off the wall or anything. I would suggest mounting where you have a good light source.</li>
    <li> First shower mirror that actually works as advertised. Don&#x27;t waste your time with anything else. I&#x27;ve used about a half dozen different products over the years, they all stink.</li>
    <li> works perfect, mirror is removable and has a water tank, you fill it up with hot water, slide it back into the holder, adjust it to the angle you want (it works for tall me and short wife), squeegee it if needed (with included squeegee), then admire yourself in the clear mirror (:</li>
    <li> Overall, I like the anti-fog results. But I had not even had this a year and it fell off my shower wall.  The silicone adhesive did not hold, and I had to go buy better shower silicone adhesive and remount.  So beware your mirror may fall!</li>
    <li> Got this for our future son-in-law for Christmas.  He&#x27;s a very picky consumer and says this mirror is great.  A little hassle to fill with water, but he says it&#x27;s worth it.  Really is fogless, unlike several others he&#x27;s tried in the past.</li>
    <li> We haven&#x27;t had this long, so I can&#x27;t speak as to how it holds up, but so far so good.  It is very secure on the wall and the mirror slides in well so it&#x27;s easy to add and then dump the water - which is what makes it fogless.  It also is held at a good angle.  My husband hung it kind of high and I thought I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use it - to chedk that I got all of my eye make-up off - but it is great, even for a shorter person.</li>
    <li> I have gone through several brands of shower mirrors, this by far is the best one I&#x27;ve purchased.  You have to fill the back of the mirror with warm water, which unlike any others on the market.</li>
    <li> I have been disappointed by \\&quot;fog-less\\&quot; shower mirrors before, but this time they got it right. It was simple to install and by using the hot water from the shower, it truly does remain fog free. My only regret so far is that I didn&#x27;t get the largest mirror ToiletTree makes. Hopefully, this will last and work well for a long time.</li>
    <li> This is a well-designed product that is easy to use and performs exactly as advertised.  Easily the best fogless mirror that I have owned.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about every fogless shower mirror, and this one finally works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a safety blade in the shower so my shaves take long. Other mirrors work ok, but fog up after a few minutes in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;This one stays clear for a LONG time. I had no issues with it ever fogging, even if I took a really long, hot shower.</li>
    <li> I have been really impressed so far.  Having used other shower mirrors they always seem to fog up after a little while or try are too small... This mirror had none of those problems.  The product works exactly as it is supposed to and feels well made. I would like to see a level integrated into the mount, but other than I have no issues.  Highly recommend to anyone and you do get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this mirror. Makes for a nice shave in the shower and it has not failed me yet. wish i would have invented this and highly recommend. Easy to put up and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I love being able to shower and shave, all at the same time. This mirror is very easy to install and use.&lt;br /&gt;All it requires is pouring hot water into the top and sliding it back into the wall mount. Doesn&#x27;t fog up at all.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
    <li> not worth the price.  just put shaving cream on a $1 mirror and wipe off.  the slight film keeps stam from condensating on the mirror</li>
    <li> Not crazy about the razor &amp;#34;holder&amp;#34; shelf, so bought holders from the container store. Personal preference, but it does the real job it was meant to. Real mirror, great shave with less hassle.</li>
    <li> Does everything it was advertised to do. Easy to work with, easy to clean. Shipped in 3 days. Great day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the fogless mirror. It does everything it promised to do.&lt;br /&gt;Very clever mechanism.</li>
    <li> I put one of these in our shower about two years ago. The product works great! I just purchased another one for my daughters shower.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a shower mirror for a while. This one is very simple to install and works perfectly.</li>
    <li> read and follow the instructions that comes with the mirror you will never ever regret buying this product. It is awesome!</li>
    <li> Received this as a Christmas gift last year.  Nothing like being woken up at 2 in the morning to the sound of a loud bang, and not being able to find where the noise came from for 15 minutes.  It stuck to the wall for about 3 months before it fell.  Then I noticed that the mirror was rubbing off from the inside.  Still in the shower, but don&#x27;t use it as often as I had hoped since it&#x27;s not still on the wall.</li>
    <li> Excellent buy...this was for my husband and he is in love with it. The product arrived on time and in perfect conditions.</li>
    <li> Awesome mirror that finally works like it is advertised. Sticks and stays up easily and it so practical.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t want to overdue how much I love this mirror, since at the end of the day it is a shaving mirror. But man o man, this is the mirror I&#x27;ve been waiting my whole life for.  I tried some of the lower cost top rated shaving mirrors on Amazon, that require you to warm the mirror up under running water, and it would always fog half way through the shave. This mirror solves that problem with the water reservoir.  It even gives you a squeegee to wipe it after you fill it up.  And the positioning is adjustable.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I have had two of these mirrors.  The first was adhered to a plastic shower and worked well for five years.  The second one was adhered to tile  in my new house and fell off after 6 months,  I did like it when it worked and I wish there was a was to fix it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, I bumped it up another couple of stars because of the wonderful customer service of ToiletTree.  I was able to communicate with the company and get a replacement mirror.  Very good customer service!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  had the new mirror attached for 8 months, and it fell off again on to the floor.  Just don&#x27;t believe this product works.  Especially for the price you pay.</li>
    <li> I love it.  It really works as advertised.  No fog, no falling off the wall.  After shaving, my face is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s.....</li>
    <li> My husband loves this mirror!  Fill it up with hot water and completely no fog!  Easy to hang.  Great buy!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical but this thing is awesome! It is simple to use as well. I keep a cup right by the shower and simply takes 2 seconds to fill from the shower and pour into the top of the mirror. Then, the whole shower, no matter how long I take, the mirror stays fog free! The little shelf on it is perfect for holding my razor. I highly recommend this. It angle is adjustable too. If you shave in the shower, this is MUST HAVE!</li>
    <li> Should have ordered one with a light on it instead.</li>
    <li> It works!&lt;br /&gt;There isnt much to say. It works exactly as advertised. It&#x27;s simple and a very smart design. My skin looks so much better since my wife bought this for me.</li>
    <li> I really like my fog less shower mirror!!!  Keeping the glass clean with the squeegee provided is the only negative.  I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product!</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT FUNCTIONS VERY WELL AND AT A REASONABLE COST.  I WOULD DEFINITELY PURCHASE THIS ITEM IN THE FUTURE IF I HAD A NEED.  I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT</li>
    <li> Most &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; shaving mirrors which I have had don&#x27;t stay fogless very long.  This one is different.  Nary a trace of fogging on this mirror.  I wish I had found it years ago.</li>
    <li> This is the second one of these I have purchased.  The first one works so well that I got one for our second bathroom.  The mirror performs exactly as described.  Looking for a shower mirror save some time and just order this one.  Literally a 3 minute install.</li>
    <li> This actually works. However, be sure to wipe clean the surface every time you shower, this way it stays like new. Use the squeegee and you can use your towel as well.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many different types of shower mirrors and none of them have had the clarity found in this product.&lt;br /&gt;Once filled with hot water no fog forms.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s made of a lightweight plastic, no rust! The adjustable hinge doesn&#x27;t seem very sturdy... Time will tell!</li>
    <li> Bought one of these like 4 years ago. Works well but after like 3.5 years it wouldn&#x27;t stay up because the mechanism that keeps it in place just got worn. Also it gets harder to keep the screen clean after a while. Still it works well overall and I don&#x27;t mind buying one every few years.</li>
    <li> I used to have the regular shower mirror and never worked. This one is amazing.!! The code is the hot water system than help fogless. It&#x27;s a little expensive but works. Looks nice in the shower.</li>
    <li> i purchased this product because of all the great reviews on amazon about it. its an okay product in my opinion. i totally did not realized that i had to add hot water everytime i wanna use it so that it does not fog. but once you add the hot water i have to say it does work like promised. it did fall the first time i installed it, but i didn&#x27;t follow all the directions like it said. so the second time i made sure i followed directions properly and so far its still in place so lets hope it stays this way and doesn&#x27;t fall a second time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i must say i am extremely impress with this  mirror. once i made sure that i followed the directions properly it stayed in place. the mirror does not fog when u add hot water to it. and i thought it would be a hassle to keep adding hot water everytime i have to use it, but its actually not too  bad. i really like this mirror and am now very happy i made this purchase.</li>
    <li> We have tried several shower mirrors.  We had hoped this one would stick with the silicone.  It feel off the shower wall less than 3 months after it was hung and has now left messy silicone on the tile that has to be scraped off.  It&#x27;s a mess.  The mirrors with suction cups can at least be put back up when they fall.</li>
    <li> Yes, it will be fogless if you refill the reservoir each time you shower. But the reflective surface is distorted and now the tilt mechanism is failing (mirror tilts by itself) after about a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - 5/30/2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow, I never thought that the manufacturer would actually read their reviews here. I was surprised to hear from them and they offered to replace the tilt mechanism and the mirror free of charge. After I replied to their email, the replacement parts arrived within a week. The new part seemed to do the job. The mirror is totally distortion free and the new and improved tilt mechanism is holding the mirror with the reservoir full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, that&#x27;s customer service!!</li>
    <li> the pkg arrived with the glue material totally dry and useless...used double sided scotch 20# tape to secure it. the adjustable swivel&lt;br /&gt;mechanism failed after just several uses and I now must hold it in correct position by putting the handle of a disposable razor in back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the mirror itself is of a good size and does not fog at all after hot water is added to the rear portion which is quite easy to accomplish&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/2/14..after reading my initial review, the owner of the company sent me a new mount and tube of cement. The mount looks much stronger than the&lt;br /&gt;one that I had..apparently this is their current model..I will raise my rating from the previous 3 to 4 stars based on this kindness and smart PR move.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the new mount has been in place for a few months and, hopefully, works as well as advertised, I would change to 5 stars</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a bunch of shower mirrors over the years, this one works ... by far ... the best. The mount is very sturdy a and the mirror stays clear. I don&#x27;t uses the defogging feature (filling the back of the mirror water) often because the mirror stays fine without it. In the rare occasion that the mirror does fog up filling the back of the mirror with shower temperature water definitely does help.</li>
    <li> Mirror works as advertised and stays attached to the shower wall perfectly. Does not fog up and appers to be constructed pretty well. A bit pricey, but I preferred this design over their competitors.</li>
    <li> I really like the no fog design of the product.  Simply fill it up with the warm shower water and use the included squeege to wipe off the drops.  No distortion to the mirror either.  Mounts with ease and has a little shelf to hold small items.  Nice shower item.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this daily for a number of months now, it works awesome.  Follow the mounting instructions and it&#x27;ll last forever.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Have used many fogless shower mirrors before and this is the first to really work!  Would highly recommend</li>
    <li> Arrived as scheduled.  Works as advertised.  High quality mirror.  Maybe too good as I can really see my wrinkles now!</li>
    <li> This mirror works great. You fill it with hot water and it prevents any fogging. It has been securely stuck to my shower wall since I purchased it several months ago. Removing and refilling the mirror with water is easy and the shelf for my razor is a nice feature.</li>
    <li> I cleaned the tile wall.  Then cleaned with alcohol.  I used all the silicon goop and let the frame set for 24 hours.  It works great.  If it stays up for several years I&#x27;ll be happy.  The price was right too and I got it straight away.</li>
    <li> They need to come clean, hot shower water equal FOG. NICE TRY.  Still can&#x27;t find a mirror that measures up.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my old in shower shaving mirror. My old one would always fog and I was skeptical I&#x27;d ever find one that wouldn&#x27;t. When I came across this I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot because putting hot water in it to heat the mirror seemed like a logical solution. I&#x27;m still impressed with how well it works. No fog at all. The mounting sixth silicone also makes it very secure and it has been in place for a few months now with no issue. My old one was suction cup mounted and no matter how much I prepped the service it never failed to fall every few  weeks, obviously in the middle of the night while I was sleeping, and scare the crap out of me.  This mirror is sturdy, fog free, wide for a full view, and provides a sturdy shelf for your razor.  A+</li>
    <li> It works very well and was very easy to install.  We just remodeled our bathroom with all tile and it sticks to the tile with no issue.  We ordered the silver and black unit and it looks very nice in our bathroom. Filling the mirror with hot water once I am in the shower takes no time at all and then it is good for the duration of the shower.</li>
    <li> Easy to set up and fill up. Finally, I can wash my hair and not worry about missing spots or getting all of the product out. Great purchase.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a simple idea, but it does work. I only shave about once a week so removing the mirror, emptying the water and filling with hot water is fine for me. If you plan to use this daily, I suggest you go out and get a true fogless mirror, this one is just a mirror that you have to fill with hot water so it doesn&#x27;t fog up... It sticks well to the tiles and has a good application kit, probably not worth the cost though, it&#x27;s all very plasticky...</li>
    <li> I am happy with this mirror. I gave it one starless at first because I felt the edges a little sharp. However the customer service send me how to fix the sharpness. It works now perfectly. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I read the previous reviews on this product. One review reminded everyone that to keep the mirror fog less that the instructions&lt;br /&gt;said to keep water reservoir full w/hot water! This is key.&lt;br /&gt;Product installs very easily/instructions are great. Would not buy any other Fogless Mirror.</li>
    <li> The fogless part is alright but it didn&#x27;t last a week on the wall. It&#x27;s not worth $30 buck that&#x27;s for sure. This is not a very good quality mirror. It&#x27;s junk.</li>
    <li> Love the mirror so far.  Works great and is one of the best I&#x27;ve owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The included mounting hardware has silicone glue the mounting bracket to the shower wall.  For cleaning I did not want to do this, so I went out and bought some industrial velcro strips which works great.  Not sure why I would &amp;#34;glue&amp;#34; a bracket to the white tile in my shower.</li>
    <li> Im 2 weeks in and there is no fog. This is 100x better than the junk they sell at bed bath and beyond which fogged up right away and falls off the wall.&lt;br /&gt;The design is a bit primitive for $30 and its a pain to have to slide it on and off the bracket to fill with hot water. It would also be helpful to have a water release as I always forget to spill it out and hope it continues to stick to wall with added weight of water.&lt;br /&gt;I am enjoying fog free shaving and the mirror is a nice size.</li>
    <li> I mean, i thought it will not work but it works! Just add hot water inside this mirror and it will not be blurry, it will stay very clear for you to shave.</li>
    <li> It does not work at all. Stay away. I struggled so much with this one and contacted the seller and I was asked to send pictures etc. It is just horrible product and experience. Be careful. the first few months were great and then it went down hill.</li>
    <li> 4 years later I still use this regularly. It has moved to 4 different houses with me. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have had many shave mirrors and this one is absolutely the best one ever! I have now been using it for a few months. It is very clear and it doesn&#x27;t fog up. It was very easy to install. Buy it! You will love it!</li>
    <li> BEWARE!! the SQUEEGIE IT Came with scratched the mirror!!! now ALTHOUGH THE product itself works wonderfully, the squeegie needs improvements! it doesnt swipe clean, and left 5 long scratches along the front, very annoying!&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit of a hassle remembering to dump the water out and fill it, it works! and my husband can see himself while shaving!&lt;br /&gt;so far, its been 2 weeks of continual use and the silicone used has not separated or show any signs of it anytime soon so thats another pluS!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:18c0969d945c0a80e90d0b1aa847e1aa]]This video shows the front and the back of the mirror while it is mounted as it is mounted on a semi clear surface. Excellent product for the price.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband.  He loves it.  It does not fog up, like it claims and its mounted pretty strongly in the shower.  Along with a shower radio, and this mirror made a great christmas gifts.  Great product!  I would recommend this product to anyone who wants a mirror in the shower that will not fog up.  It does the job!</li>
    <li> He loves it. And what a great idea! Works simply, is low profile, and it actually works! We wipe it off after every shower to prevent mineral build up (squeegie included is useless).</li>
    <li> I got this mirror because the 5 star reviews and they didn&#x27;t lie.  Best shower mirror ever.  Simple yet very effective</li>
    <li> Husband likes it so far.  He has only used it once so far, so the review is limited.  Easy to assemble.</li>
    <li> My husband has been a shower shaver for over a decade.  We&#x27;ve tried a lot of shower mirrors throughout that time, some from high end companies, and this mirror is by far the best he&#x27;s ever used.  The promises made by the company about the mirror are legit and the product has exceeded our expectations.</li>
    <li> Really a good little mirror....easy install and works as advertised...Maybe it could be slightly bigger but I knew the dimensions when I bought it so that&#x27;s on me.</li>
    <li> I have had many of the &amp;#34;fogproof&amp;#34; mirrors over the years and am here to tell you, they were terrible.  This is, far and away, what a person needs if they shave in the shower.  Takes a couple of seconds to fill, see instructions, and then you are on the way.  I could not reccomend any product more than this.</li>
    <li> My husband loves his new gift! It works very well - no fogging at all. It is easy to install too!</li>
    <li> I purchased this mirror as a  gift for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;He was very disappointed with the one he had because it was way to small and constantly fogged up on him.&lt;br /&gt;My husband was so excited when I gave this to him and could not wait to get it on the shower wall.&lt;br /&gt;He said it works just as promised and loves the large size, the squeegee and the shelf to put his razor on.&lt;br /&gt;I was very impressed with the shipping and quick delivery of this item.&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase from this seller again. I had no difficulties.</li>
    <li> We love this mirror it does exactly what it says! It does not fog if you fill it with hot water and it does not fall! That&#x27;s all we needed &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> This is my third order for one of these great &#x27;fog free shower mirrors&#x27;. The first was to be mounted in my home shower, PERFECT!!&lt;br /&gt;The second one was for my travel kit, again, PERFECT! The third was for my son-in-law for his shower at home...can&#x27;t wait until my grandson is ready for one!&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU for a GREAT product!</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this mirror because shaving in the shower is great! I followed all the directions and used the entire tube of silicone to hang the mirror on a clean and dry shower wall. I let it sit for 24 hrs before use and then it worked great for over a week. Filling it with water really isn&#x27;t a big hassle at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &#x27;but...&#x27; in this review is that when my girlfriend wanted to use the mirror I went to lower the angle for her the mirror broke away from the silicone and came right off the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve sent an email to ToiletTree requesting another tube or silicone and stickies to re-install the mirror as it did work great - I will update this review once I get word back from them. Easily will become a 5 if I can get some more glue/am able to adjust the angle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: less than 2 hours after this post the company responded and are shipping additional glue. Great company service! As promised changed to 5 stars</li>
    <li> With regular mirrors, I used to splash water on them to wash the fog and be able to see myself.&lt;br /&gt;This fogless mirror doesn&#x27;t get fog but still gets water drops and you should wipe it several times.&lt;br /&gt;I read many reviews before buying it but nobody mentioned that you need to wipe the water drops while using it. However, it is still better than regular mirrors and I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is such a great differentiator from all those fog less out there.  The simple solution of using water in the back to prevent fogging in shower is just perfect and I can&#x27;t believe that every other fog less doesn&#x27;t do this...  Each fog less I&#x27;ve used in the past eventually failed...this one is great.... I give it 5 stars...high recommendation..buy this one and stop having to replace others regularly...</li>
    <li> A little annoying to install at first but worth the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do have to fill with water for each use and then dump out the water but it works great.</li>
    <li> Easy to install, easy to use. Works as advertised. So far, so good.</li>
    <li> works very well. My only suggestion to the manufacturer would be to make a more expensive version in chrome or brushed nickel or bronze. This is plastic. Something that matches the shower fixtures. I would pay more for that.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. The mirror is always crystal clear and stays that way for the whole shower. I would highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> Great product to shave in the shower with</li>
    <li> Easy install. Stays up. The patent of the water in the back really works, never fogs up.</li>
    <li> worked great for awhile but now it cant stay up with or without water in it, just wish it was built to last longer</li>
    <li> Great product..highly recommend</li>
    <li> Nice concept, but cumbersome having to add hot water and pour out each use.</li>
    <li> Works perfect so far. As long as you follow the instructions on how to mount this it will stick. Make sure the silicone had plenty of time to cure. I mounted mine right to the glass on my shower and hung a bag over it for 3 days so it didn&#x27;t get wet. The mirror DOES NOT FOG when you put water in it, nice job guys, great product!</li>
    <li> Item works as described. Our shower wall cannot hold a suction cup, but this adhesive has worked great. The fogless feature works, and the squeegee is small and easily stored.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mirror a little while ago and have loved it since day one.  It does exactly what it should and quite well.  I just moved and had to take it off my wall which wasn&#x27;t too bad if you have an exacto blade.  The company will supply you with a new mounting kit free of charge which is amazing customer service and to be honest quite refreshing to know that there are companies out there willing to go the extra mile for their customers.</li>
    <li> This mirror is the everything I wanted in a fog-less mirror. Should be the last fog-less mirror I&#x27;ll ever need to buy!</li>
    <li> The mirror works OK for shaving in the shower. No fog! It should last a long time. It&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of shower mirrors in the past. All of the ones either fogged up and/or fell off the wall. This product solves both problems.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for!  It works, was easy to install, and customer service appears to be AWESOME!</li>
    <li> AMAZING Product!!!  I have tried all the &#x27;fog free&amp;#34; shower mirrors and this one truly works!!!  Easy to use and nice size.  LOVE IT!!!!  You won&#x27;t regret this one.  They have great customer service as well.</li>
    <li> I love how well this mirror stays on the wall and how easy it is to adjust for hubby and I.  The reservoir is easy to fill up and the squeegee is something I would have never thought to be included but am really glad to have!  The best feature; I don&#x27;t have to worry about it falling and breaking on the kids with the shatter proof acrylic.</li>
    <li> This mirror is terrific.  It never fogs up and it never falls of the wall.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product and the people behind ToiletTree Products are also great.  I had a problem with my mirror after I had it for more than a year and the people at ToiletTree Products sent me a part to fix the problem (no charge for the part and no charge for S&amp; H) and now I have, once again, a perfectly good working mirror&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this Fogless Shower Mirror or the people that sell it.</li>
    <li> Wow... it is not very often that I write a review about a product or the customer support for a product. This shower mirror does exactly what it is supposed to do. I use it everyday and it stays clear without fogging. I had an issue with a faulty light switch, but with one call to customer service, the problem was pleasantly resolved and the product replaced. A 5-star experience!!!</li>
    <li> Love this mirror in my shower. Fill it up with warm water, and it is fog free your whole shower. I&#x27;ve had it for a couple year now. The lights went out pretty fast and I haven&#x27;t bothered replacing the batteries. Don&#x27;t really need the light anyways. Only problem I&#x27;ve had with this item is the hinge the mirror is on. The mirror can be adjusted for different angles. I think the weight of the water you fill the mirror with strips the plastic hinge easily. I put an old shave gel cap behind it to prop it level. Problem solved. I&#x27;d buy this mirror again if needed.</li>
    <li> the BEST!  bought many that claimed to be fogless and they NEVER were - this one really works!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Incredible product. Wish I came across this several years ago!</li>
    <li> I Love this Fogless Mirror works awesome and actually stays on the wall, Was very easy to put up. This will make for a great Holiday Gift! Thanks for making a nice product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for two years now and I have not regretted it at all.  You just put warm water in it and it keeps the mirror from fogging up.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror. I had another shower mirror forever, and it eventually lost it&#x27;s anti-fogging ability. This mirror is sweet because it uses a different approach (hot water behind the mirror). I haven&#x27;t had any problems that other people have mentioned (I&#x27;ve only had it for about 3 months). Easy to install and set up.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shower mirror for my son as a Christmas gift. I had no prior personal knowledge of fogless mirrors and the price was a little more than I intended to spend, but after reading all the positive reviews decided it would be worth the money to give it a try.  My son was very happy with the gift when he opened it and I explained all the positive comments. Shortly after Christmas I asked him about the installation and daily use and he couldn&#x27;t have been more thrilled. He said it installed easily, just as the instructions described. He loves that it tilts and has a place to hold his razor, but most importantly he is very impressed that it does not fog. Definitely a great purchase and one that I would wholeheartedly recommend to others. Also, I was well pleased that item was received just 4 days after placing order. Two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I have used this mirror now for several weeks and it is wonderful. Just fill it with warm shower water and it stays perfectly clear no matter how long your in the shower. The squeegee that it comes with is a must to wipe off the water beads prior to shaving so you have a perfectly clear mirror. I highly recommend this product and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on other Amazon users&#x27; recommendations. It was easy to put together and apply. I will let you know if there are any problems in the future. Remember, no news is good news!  January 5, 2012  January 17th, 2012  I am still extremely pleased with the performance of this shower mirror. It slides off the well constructed plastic frame easily so you can fill the back of the mirror with hot or even warm water, which prevents it from fogging up.  Then you slide it back on the frame, lather up and shave. The opening at the top of the mirror where the water goes in is wide enough to hold your razor as well when not in use. There is also a platform under the mirror that you could lay your razor upon, and beneath the platform is a place to hold the squeegee that you can also easily slide the squeegee in and out of without problem. The squeegee is the exact width of the mirror, so one downward wipe does the job.  The mirror repels the water so it only beads up on it. I never need to squeegee it while shaving, I only do it after I am done shaving.  No water spot stains on the mirror after over a week of usage.  The mirror frame is held onto the shower wall via adhesive which is included along with the double stick tape, and the back of the frame is clearly marked so you see exactly where to apply both the mounting tape and the adhesive.  It takes twelve hours before the frame is secured and adhesive set before you can put the mirror up on the frame. Let it dry for the twelve hour period it requires and then slide the mirror on to the frame, and you are all set.  I really like it. I had a suction cup mounted fog-less mirror that fell down nearly daily with an alarming crash before buying this one. It also fogged up. I hated having my razor and razorblades chip from falling down with the dang thing. That is no longer a worry. I am very pleased thus far. I will update this should there be any problem in the future.</li>
    <li> Love it! Product arrived perfectly intact and on time. Glued to the wall perfectly and has since been used everyday.  It&#x27;s exactly what I needed in the shower so that my shave could be precise.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mirror for my boyfriend for Christmas and he loves it! It was easy to hang and it&#x27;s easy to fill up with water before each shower (to prevent fogging). The squeegie works great as well. So far, no complaints!</li>
    <li> This is best shower mirror I have used. I have purchased several and looking forward to trying new &amp;#34;water system&amp;#34; for fog less. Squigee is great idea, but physics prevents total fogless. I appreciate that they had the guts to make the mirror actually stay mounted yet be removable (the silicon glue instead of suction. Mine have been durable. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had other &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; mirrors that used a coating for the foglessness, but which quickly over time lost the ability to remain so.  I wasn&#x27;t willing to get one of the fancy ones that connect directly to the showerhead with a water connection.  This is a good, simple, and efficient compromise that merely requires you fill the reservoir behind the mirror when needed.  It works perfectly and solves the fogging issue correctly.  It can be demonstrated by filling the reservoir half way and noting the bottom half of the mirror remaining clear while the top half fogs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main concern is how it is mounted.  It came with a measly two sticky pads that looked wholly inadequate on their own so likely are to assist in the mounting with the included adhesive.  This makes the mirror quasi-permenant and means I can&#x27;t easily switch it between my bathrooms.  I can live with that for now.  But I do have concerns how cleanly it can be unmounted when the time comes; which includes how well the back of the base is preserved in the process for remounting somewhere else.  On the other hand, given the added water weight, I doubt that suction cup mounts would be sufficient and I&#x27;ve had issues with them in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other points and my opinion:&lt;br /&gt;* It&#x27;s rather big, probably bigger than it needs to be (positive).&lt;br /&gt;* It has a shelf for the razor (positive) but I wish it had a little something to keep it from slipping or moving like some bumps, a border or even some kind of rubberized coating (negative).&lt;br /&gt;* it has a squeegee and a place to store it (very positive)&lt;br /&gt;* the plastic materials do feel kind of cheap though, especially for something that needs to be mounted quasi-permenantly (negative).  I can imagine an accident where the shelf breaks off and I am concerned when it comes time to unmount the base if it might break in the process of ripping it from the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I like it a lot because it works better than any shower mirror I&#x27;vehad before, and my only real &amp;#34;concern&amp;#34; is when it comes time to remove it cleanly and then re-attach it somewhere else.</li>
    <li> I bought this shower mirror for my boyfriend to get him to shave more often - and it worked! He loves being able to shave in the shower, not in front of my sink, and I love not having to clean the disgusting sink! It looks exactly as nice as the image shown and doesn&#x27;t look bulky or take up too much room in my small shower space. Keep in mind though, that it takes 12 hours for the silicone adhesive to dry onto the shower surface, and the silicone should not be applied in a steamy bathroom or onto a wet surface.</li>
    <li> When we first got this I don&#x27;t know who wanted it more me or my hubby. So, we took it out of the box and came to realize something that we really liked. NO suction cups that is really nice because it seems like every-time you use something that has suction cups it just falls off. With this product you actually use adhesive which works so much better and lasts. We did let it stand for a full 24 hours before putting the mirror on it and using it. Another great thing is the ease of putting and taking the mirror off. It just slides off very easy. Since we ended up putting it in the shower we did put it pretty high up since my hubby is 6&#x27;2\\&quot; and I am only 5&#x27;2\\&quot; we got to test the tilting of it and it works really well also. My hubby really likes the shelf built on it for the ease of being able to have a place to put his razor, me I think the squeegee is really cool plus I like how you can store it and not worry about losing it. In our house this would happen so this way it attaches right to the product. This would be a great gift for my dad on Father&#x27;s Day he would love it!</li>
    <li> Mirror shipped quickly and was exactly as advertised. Great product and I would absolutely buy it again. The silicone adhesion system is 100 times better than the suction cups which are prone to falling off.</li>
    <li> Was pleased with this purchase.  Never sure if/how a product like this will work.  The only issue is the fact that once you fill it with water it tends to tilt downwards every so ofter and you have to carefully adjust it.  Needs stronger tilt mechanism.  Would still recommend it tho!</li>
    <li> The mirror arrived on time, in great shape, is exactly as described. We even got a follow up e-mail with care instructions. Very happy with the seller and the mirror, we have not mounted it to the wall yet, but not at all worried about it.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a replacement for my long lasting shower mirror that finally just gave out after many happy years of service.  It was the white plastic one that you screwed on to the pipe and then put your shower head back on.  For my money that is by far the best one out there.  With that said, I wanted to get a nicer looking mirror so I decided to order this ToiletTree product.  The fact that it actually works great was the reason I gave it 4 stars.  A perfect product . . .  it is not.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong.  It works fine.  It&#x27;s the process that comes along with the item that had me leave out one star.  The object of the mirror is to place it somewhere out of the way of water fall on one of your shower walls.  You&#x27;ll need to glue it and use the tacky strips provided.  When I went to do just that, I found that I had a decorative raised tile strip that was exactly at the level that I needed to mount the mirror.  Ok, not the mirrors fault.  Luckily, I have a ledge that the mirror sits on perfectly.  If you are able to mount it on a wall, then when ready to shave, remove the mirror from the base, fill it with the hot water, place it back on the base and shave.  More work than I deem necessary, but hey that&#x27;s what I bought.  If you can&#x27;t mount it on a dry wall away from the shower head like me, here is what you can expect.  I can&#x27;t fill it all the way because then it becomes top heavy and will topple over.  Lucky for me, the 1st time I used it, as it fell forward, I caught it.  So, fill it about half full and you get most the mirror.  I use the squeegee quite often because the water splashes on to the mirror.  When finished, I just empty it out and it&#x27;s ready for the next day.  All in all, it works as it is supposed to.  It doesn&#x27;t fog up and I can get a good shave.  Just be sure you know that you will have to remove the mirror, fill it each time, and then dump the water out.  If you&#x27;re ok with that, then it will be a 5 star product in your hands.  Good luck!</li>
    <li> It works as advertised.  Just fill the small reservoir with hot water or water from the shower head and the mirror stays fog free. Not a waste of water as some have written (there&#x27;s a crank in every bunch). The reservoir holds maybe 6 or 8 ounces at most.  My only wish is that it came in other colors besides nickel.  Brown, black or bronze would be nice options.</li>
    <li> After a fair amount of research, Idecided to go with this product.  I am very happy with it.  It was easy to install, the mirror does not fog up, the reservoir is easy to fill, and there is a nice shelf for a razor.  I enthusiastically recommend it.</li>
    <li> This item is great, works really good and it DOES NOT FOG UP PERIOD. Excellent customer service to boot.... Definate buy...</li>
    <li> This really works.  I&#x27;ve tried several fogless mirrors that were more expensive but simply didn&#x27;t stay fogless.  This one really does....get it if you shave in the shower!!!</li>
    <li> I received this as a present after complaining for years about shaving (either not getting everything while in the shower, or leaving my face looking scorched). Mirror works as advertised, shelf is slightly small for a 3+ blade razor but is functional. The attached squeegee really makes the difference.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The installation is a breeze, and the mirror itself remains solid in the wall. After 8+ months the mirror still remains in the wall and it is still fogless!</li>
    <li> Great product.  If you want something that works, get this.  It&#x27;s pretty simple to install &amp; works great.  Thanks much</li>
    <li> Will not fog up, so long as you remembered to fill up the water reservoir each time you need to use your mirror.  Stays on the wall after the twelve hour drying time of the silicone adhesive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product, does what it says it will do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased several in-shower mirrors for shaving, and regardless of their fog-free fanfare, they either don&#x27;t work at all, work for a short period of time, collect hard water deposits to the point it doesn&#x27;t matter whether you have fog on the mirror (consisting of some reflective adhesive you can&#x27;t clean) or not.  My favorite was a contraption that was supposed to direct a stream of water to the mirror to keep fog off, but ended up spurting water everywhere but where it was supposed to go.  In addition, the big, clunky fake mirror kept sagging from where I would put it via the goose-neck support.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I decided to try the ToiletTree, and have been very pleased.  It takes a bit of time to let the adhesive dry, but no big deal.  Just make sure you have the base mounted at the height you want, because once it&#x27;s set, it ain&#x27;t goin&#x27; nowhere.  In fact, I&#x27;m on here ordering another one because I&#x27;m moving and can&#x27;t bring my trusty #1 with me to the new place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 2 years of use, I still have a clean mirror, thanks to the provided squeegee.  Also, the reservoir works like a charm, allowing me fog free performance, regardless of how long I&#x27;m in the shower, or what the temp the water in the reservoir is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a great product, and while it may be a tad more than many other shower shaving gadgets, you&#x27;ll never need to worry about buying another one....That is, until you move.</li>
    <li> Use it every day. Simple to mount and easy to use. Simply pull mirror off bracket, fill with warm water from shower, put back on bracket and it remains fog free.</li>
    <li> Just what I&#x27;ve been looking for.&lt;br /&gt;No more fighting with my wife over mirror space in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;She can do her hair while I shave in the shower.</li>
    <li> I bought this a year and a half ago when I lived in an apartment and I didn&#x27;t really want to secure it to the wall with the adhesive so I tucked it away.  Now that I finally bought my own place, I installed it in my tile shower.  And all I can say is wow.  I wish I had installed it sooner.  It does have 2 pieces of sticky tape, but you have to use the silicone adhesive as well since you have to load the mirror with warm/hot water.  It takes it about 12 hours to dry.  I like that the mirror rotates, has a shelf for my razor, and a squeegee to wipe of any water droplets.  Not once have I had to wipe it off because it fogged up.  I couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled with this item.</li>
    <li> I have purchased several fog less mirrors in my lifetime (shave in shower) &amp; this is truly the BEST Fog less Mirror on the market in my opinion.  I am ordering more for Christmas Gifts!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like the same mirror w/Suction cups....my shower is glass on the wall I would have mounted it.  I&#x27;ve never had a mirror fall w/the 4 large suction cups.&lt;br /&gt;Then I would give the product a 5 STAR RATING!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve struggled for several years with other mirrors - they fog up and fall off the wall.  Just got this one and it works great.  Just fill the dispenser with water - and no fog.  Also, it stays on the wall - much better than the small suction cups on other mirrors.  This mirror works exactly as it should - it does the job very well.  I highly recommend this Fogless Mirror by ToiletTree Products.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after hearing about it on a shaving website that I am a member of.  After being disappointed with several lack-luster mirrors, I decided to do some research to find something that was truly fog-free.  I didn&#x27;t want something that I had to modify my showerhead (no tubes for me, thank you!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the idea of being able to change the angle of this in case my spouse wanted to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for over a week now and have been very pleased!  I empty it before each shower, and fill it up while the shower is running.  I read some reviews that said it was tricky to remove/replace mirror on mount, but didn&#x27;t find this to be the case.  It is very easy to remove/replace and I an clearly see the mounting bracket from the side to easily mount the mirror.  I then use the included squeegee and away I go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, I have recommended it to all of my head (and face) shaving buddies out there.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect item for any guy that needs a little visual help if shaving in the shower. I bought this for my bf and now he no longer looks like an angry badger attacked him every time he has a shower. He loves this thing. At first I thought the dumping the water out and refilling it every time would be terrible, but its not. Super easy. You should buy it!</li>
    <li> I was a little skepticle at first. But, after first use, I knew it was as advertised. I&#x27;ve been using this mirror for over a month now and it hasn&#x27;t fallen off the shower pane and it&#x27;s TRUELY Fogless! definitely as good as Advertised!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this unit in December 2010 after trying a number of similar products.  My purchase was really a last gasp effort although Amazon listed several positive reviews at the time.  You can read the other reviews for instructions on how to mount this unit and how well it performs.  My review today is in regards to the longevity of the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For nearly 17 months, this item has fully exceeded my expectations by working exactly as described. Prior to buying this unit, I occasionally shaved in the shower. Within weeks of installing the unit, I started shaving full time in the shower. The squeegee worked well, the mirror did not fog, and I could use it at any angle.  My standard practice was to fill the mirror with hot water at the start of the shower and empty it at the close of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Entering the 18 month, the mirror still functions very well. However, the bracket that holds the mirror has lost its ability to keep the mirror at any angle except pointing downwards.  In inspecting the teeth that engage to position the mirror, it appears that the teeth on my base have worn. Since this item&#x27;s base is silconed to my wall and since I am enamored with it, I will contact the company in search of an in-situ repair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, to receive nearly 18-months of flawless operation for a $30 item is money well spent.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve only had the mirror for a couple of weeks but so far so good. Hubby wishes it was a bit larger(should have gotten the larger one). I didn&#x27;t realize that you have to remove the mirror from the holder to dump the water out so that to me is kind of a pain but hubby isn&#x27;t complaining so all is well. I like the way the mirror holder is mounted with out those suction cups.  Would have given 5 stars if not for the dump the water issue.</li>
    <li> I bought this fogless shower solely based on the reviews here. It took a bit of planning to install as you need to have the space dry for a few hours in advance and then leave it dry after so for 24 hours, your shower is out of commission to be safe but after that, you are in business baby! I love that the mirror tilts because I am shorter than my beloved and well, I didn&#x27;t want him to stoop so the bending is brilliant. I love the size of this mirror too and I am glad it&#x27;s a square - I&#x27;ve had oval and round mirrors and square is just perfect! Seriously stoked that we added this to our shower and loving it for a solid 5 star!</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a similiar mirror that was very old and hard to see with. This mirror went up quickly and is easy to fill with warm water and thus gives a very clear reflection. I would highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Works as described. Hasn&#x27;t fogged up yet, as long as you fill the reservoir with hot water. The adhesive makes it strong enough to not move.</li>
    <li> I looked at many fogless mirrors that cost far more and entailed difficult installation.  This mirror is exactly as advertised.  It could not be more simple to install and use.  Am I satisfied...absolutely!</li>
    <li> Works as described. Great product. Easy to install. Perfect size for your shower. Makes shaving so much easier. Good value.</li>
    <li> This is just as advertised. Easy to install, easy to use. Clear as a bell to see to shave while showering. I wasn&#x27;t disappointed, in fact, I&#x27;m getting the best shaves I&#x27;ve had in years.</li>
    <li> There are very few product that can alter the outcome of one&#x27;s life.  This shaving mirror is one of the few.  Never ever ever ever ever ever ever fogs...seriously.</li>
    <li> This fogless shower mirror works as advertised in that when it&#x27;s filled with water it does not fog up.  It would have received 5 stars from me if it could swivel left/right in additional to the up/down direction.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. My husband loves it.  He has had several different brands and this one works the best.</li>
    <li> Good quality and works well. If fogging becomes an issues, wipe the face with soap and water. Will be good as new. I also recommend drilling a tiny (.05\\&quot;) hole in the base to let the water automatically drain. Rather than lifting &amp; dumping repeatedly.</li>
    <li> I found the product to not be fogless.  I have a problem with it.  I ordered 2, one I opened and the other was for a gift but I won&#x27;t give it because it is embarrassing.  I asked to return it a week ago but still haven&#x27;t heard from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great product and works exactly as advertised. Everyone knows the best shave is in the shower or after a steaming hot towel at the old school style barber&#x27;s. Toiletree&#x27;s fogless mirror works like a dream and the water trick of repurposing the same temperature hot water you&#x27;re already using for your shower to keep the mirror from fogging is genius! Totally recommended but I will add that although installation was a breeze, I have not yet had to remove the mirror from my shower wall, so I cannot say how easy uninstallation is at this stage.</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s advertised to do. The only problem is the racheting adjustment for tilting the unit is flemsey and will not hold the mirror in the desired position.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, price and delivery - thanks - will buy again 5*</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it says.  Easy to install and easy to use.</li>
    <li> This shower mirror is truly fogless! It is the only one I&#x27;ve owned that really doesn&#x27;t fog over in the shower. Rather than use a coating that wears out quickly or never works like other shower mirrors, this uses a hot water reservoir behind the mirror to keep condensation off. Just fill the reservoir with hot water when you get in the shower, and the mirror will be clean and usable the whole time. Just remember to pour the water out when you&#x27;re through using, or it&#x27;ll be full of cold water the next shower.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I had was the first mirror I bought (I have 2, for 2 showers) the silicone glue had hardened. A quick trip to the big box store and that was fixed.</li>
    <li> I really liked it when I got it, and I installed it per the instructions in my new shower. It worked as promoted. But then last week when I went to go to the shower I found it one the floor with the silicone still on the wall. Now I am not sure what to do with it, maybe buy silicone and stickers at home depot? If it hadn&#x27;t fallen I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> FINALLY!!!It works!  Been using it for over 9 months.  Love it!</li>
    <li> The mirror works great! We got it in December 2013 and it is now August 2015.  My issue is that it just fell off of the shower wall this last week.  I know the adhesive was applied correctly because it&#x27;s all still stuck to our shower wall.  The adhesive apparently &amp;#34;lost its grip&amp;#34; with the mirror and caused it to fall.  Now we have a shower wall with adhesive on it and a mirror that we&#x27;re not sure how to get back up. But - again - the mirror itself (as far as the fogless aspect) worked great.  My husband loved it.  Not sure what to do with it now, though.</li>
    <li> Says that it is fogless, not true. This mirror fogs up like crazy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for over 3 years and it is one of my favorite and most reliable products. It stayed attached to my shower tiles the entire time and then when I had to take it down to move, it came off easily and without leaving any residue. I am mostly leaving this comment though for the great customer service. I contacted ToiletTree Products and asked them if there was a way to buy a new silicone residue so I could re-attach the mirror in my new apartment. They responded immediately and shipped me a new sticker (they no longer use the residue) at no cost and it arrived before I got to the new apartment. Amazing!</li>
    <li> The mirror works as advertised. You just put hot water and it stays fog free. I would recommended this to my friends.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Does what they say.  I love this product.  I have had the suction cup type mirrors in the past and eventually they all fell at some point. This product will not do this due to the silicone they supply. The silicone is permanent in that you can only use it once (not that you can&#x27;t remove the mirror and use more silicone to remount it). There is no glass which is fine as the surface is plenty good enough for my uses.  The anti fog feature works exactly as advertised. Just fill with hot water to prevent fogging. I also like the little squeeqe and its built in holder. The only thing I would recommend is that the shelf that holds the razor have some type of groove or pattern to facilitate draining water off the shelf.  As it is it is just a flat smooth surface which water puddles on and your razor tends to soak in it until it dries.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this. It works perfectly and stays put on the shower wall.&lt;br /&gt;I first bought the model with LED lighting. The light didn&#x27;t help at all I returned it for this model which is less expensive, but no lights. My shower is well lit and the lights were not necessary. This mirror is slightly smaller than the lighted one, but more than big enough. Great purchase.</li>
    <li> I got this because of the great reviews and at first it worked greater. Easy to put up, easy to fill up the bin, and it never fogged up. It is also nice that you can angle it up or down. However, after a few months of use the wheel with teeth that lets you angle it have worn down. Therefore, whenever I fill up the bin, it immediately drops down. If i would have known that I would have put it higher on the shown and just kept it angled down the whole time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great for a few months, then worthless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: So after leaving this bad review the company contacted me and offered to send a new pivot part for free. It was easy to swap in the new part (done in 30 seconds) and now it holds up great again. I&#x27;m updating to 4 stars since now it is back to the perfect mirror. Only 4 stars though since I&#x27;m not sure how long the part will hold up for but if I get this problem again, I&#x27;ll simply asked for the new part.</li>
    <li> This mirror is a good size, is easy to setup, easy to use, and works exactly as it is described.  My only complaint would be that I wish it had a bigger tray to place my razor, or had a place to hang the razor.  Other than that, exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> My husband wears facial hair so having the ability to shave in the shower and accurately helps minimize the mess on the bathroom counter and sink (he makes a huge mess). So I was excited to learn about Toilet Tree Products and their amazing Fog less Shower Mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is designed to forever be fog less, which means that you will never had to replace it. This mirror has some amazing features, such as the always fog less, adjustable frame, the wonderful shelf where you can place your razor so you always know where it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror comes with everything you need to mount the mirror. It will adhere to any surface and does so using a soft silicone adhesive which is included. In addition although its strong you can easily remove it and it will not damage the surface that it is on. My husband and I put this to the test. When we first installed it in his shower the height he selected turned out to not be the best place to put it. So after having it in the shower for about a week or so we ended up having to move it. It did come off and did not leave any mark. In addition it was still very easy to put back up.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Very easy to install -- just use the included silicone adhesive (looks like silicone caulking compound that you can easily get at your hardware store if you run out) and stick it to your wall.  Once you fill it with the water, the mirror stays perfectly clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a small amount of distortion in the mirror, but it&#x27;s not really noticeable when you&#x27;re looking in it up close -- which is what you&#x27;ll probably be doing when you&#x27;re shaving anyway.  It doesn&#x27;t take away from the functionality of the product.</li>
    <li> This works really well compared to all other mirrors I&#x27;ve used before.  Seems like this company really cares about their product and customers.  The included adhesive was way beyond my expectations. After 3 years of using the product, the bracket is still stuck to the wall. The pivot that connects to the mirror broke after enough wear but customer service is willing to replace it for free! I have never experienced such great (and prompt) customer service before. ToiletTree Products knows how to do business! :)</li>
    <li> Had a few problems at frist but Company took care of my concerns , After my concerns where met i have had no problems with product and would  recommend this to anyone the Mirror works as stated and it dose its job</li>
    <li> Did not like it as you had to add water to it every time you shave. There was no mention of that in the description. Sent it back</li>
    <li> Edit:  Well, the company saw my review and immediately sent me a new pivot mechanism that apparently fixes the issue that I was having.  So far, the mechanism seems much more rigid, and the issue seems to be solved.  I&#x27;m going to rate this 4 stars for now, and update this in a few months when I can see how well the new pivot holds up to time.  At the very least, the company has very good service and strives to make sure that their customers are satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mirror is awesome (at first).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things that work well:  Anti-fog technology is great (if you fill the reservoir in the back with warm/hot water, your mirror will never fog).  The fact that I can shave in the shower is awesome too (saves time, and shaving is way easier - I get way fewer cuts).  The stickers that attach the mirror to your wall are great too - the fixture is still up after a year of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things that don&#x27;t work well:  The mechanical design is unreliable/faulty.  The mechanism that allows you to adjust the angle of the mirror breaks down really easily.  I mounted the mirror to be level with the height of my face (so that when the mirror is angled to be straight-ahead, I could see most of my face when shaving).  The only time I ever adjusted it was when I needed to angle it one level down to see my neck.  However, after only 3 months of use, the mirror started falling down to the very bottom rung/angle whenever I filled the mirror with water.  The mechanism can&#x27;t bear the weight of the water in the reservoir anymore.  Eventually, I had to angle the mirror up one rung at a time, and all the rung angles wore out.  After a whole year of use, the mirror only sits at the very top angle (so I have to stand on my tip toes to see my face), or the very bottom angle (where it falls down to most often, in which case I have to crouch to see my face).  Since this mechanical design wears down so easily, the instruction booklet should tell people to mount it such that the mirror is above them, and they can see their face at the very bottom angle that the mirror can be mounted.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought two of these and about to get my third; the adhesive isn&#x27;t reusable so I need a new one whenever I move but that&#x27;s my own problem so I&#x27;m still giving the product 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Both of the ones I&#x27;ve had stuck like cement and never had any issues with them becoming unglued.&lt;br /&gt;I start up my shower and immediately fill the reservoir with the shower-head and put it back in its base. After shaving I dump the reservoir along the shower wall and wash away my shavings that got all over. Couldn&#x27;t be easier for a rushed shower.</li>
    <li> Finally found a mirror that my husband didn&#x27;t make me take back.  Large, good quality mirror and it really doesn&#x27;t fog.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday after he mentioned several times how he wished he could shave in the shower.  He absolutely loves this mirror.  It doesn&#x27;t fog and he shaves more now.  Very happy with this product!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the fogless mirror for almost three years and I have no complaints. It still doesn&#x27;t fog, it has stayed attached to the shower wall without coming loose, and the adjustable bracket makes it easy to use for both my husband and me. He is 6&#x27;4\\&quot; and I&#x27;m 5&#x27;7\\&quot;. I would caution buyers to not store anything on top of the mirror as this will loosen the bracket making it less able to stay at certain angles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I was not compensated for this review. All opinions are my own.)</li>
    <li> I am SO happy with this purchase! Such a simple concept, but it works flawlessly every time! It takes a little time and patience to install - but it is NOT hard!  Anyone can do it, just follow the easy, clear instructions.  I&#x27;m so glad it&#x27;s not held up with stupid little suction cups!  There&#x27;s NO WAY this mirror is going to come off until I TAKE it off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little shelf very handy.  There&#x27;s no where else to put my razor in my shower, so it really helps.  The little squeegee is a nice touch, but I don&#x27;t use it if I&#x27;m in a hurry (most mornings)  :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been through so many &amp;#34;no-fog&amp;#34; shower mirrors. Most of &#x27;em lasted about a month before I was frustrated and ready to throw them out.  I am sure I will have THIS one for many years to come!</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical about this product, despite the high rating it has. I had tried a few fogless mirrors in the past, and all of them would work great for about a month (if even that), and then start fogging up no matter what.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mirror works in that you put warm water in a reservoir behind the mirror, which keeps the mirror from fogging during use. And, really, no fog appears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this mirror for almost a year, at this point, and can&#x27;t say that I have any complaints. If the mirror has already fogged up before I add water, once I add water to the reservoir, the fog is gone. If I forget the water in the reservoir overnight, I just dump it out, refill it, and then it works just as it should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s great, also, is that the mirror doesn&#x27;t attach to your shower by way of a suction cup, but instead uses a silicone adhesive. This is especially great if your shower has textured walls or tiling, and I have always found that suction cups warp or wear over time. The silicone adhesive has not yet given any sign of failing, and holds to the shower wall just as well as the first day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint that I could have about this is that you are not able to easily move the mirror to a different spot, due to the silicone adhesive. While you are able to remove the adhesive from the wall with little trouble, you will need to apply new adhesive. But, I can&#x27;t really complain about this too bad, as it is really easy to procure a silicone adhesive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror also comes with a squeegee for the mirror, and recommends that you use this squeegee on the mirror after each use. I have often forgotten to wipe the mirror clean, but have had no issues with clarity after just rinsing the mirror under water and using the squeegee to clear the mirror of any droplets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, after a year of use, I still consider this is to be a great product that works exactly as described.</li>
    <li> The hinge that the mirror uses to swivel doesn&#x27;t hold the mirror up any more.  Since this product has almost 5 stars... I was expecting better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked great for 3 months now it is a piece of junk&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: Steve Parisi, President at Toilet Tree Products, has offered to replace this Pivot piece at no charge.  I will edit my review accordingly once I verify this piece ameliorates the issue.</li>
    <li> This mirror works great.  It doesn&#x27;t ever fog.  I have used other mirrors that were smaller and were not this consistently clear.  I put one in my shower at the beach house and the guests love it too.  Now I give them as gifts for the friends and family.</li>
    <li> The mirror fell off because their tape sucks. So I used my own two-way tape and used extra to ensure it will not fall off again. The mirror works great and it never fogs up once you add the hot water into the chamber. I suggest this mirror to anyone who shaves in the shower.</li>
    <li> This mirror changed my life.  Must have for bald guys everywhere.</li>
    <li> This mirror is great, and there is no fog at all.  I saw that some people felt like the image was distorted ,however I don&#x27;t see that at all.  Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had 2 of these and both of them fell off the shower wall after 6 months or so.</li>
    <li> I use it every day when i shower not only when i shave but in general. sticks to wall nicely</li>
    <li> This is the best and only truly fogless shaving mirror I have ever found. Follow the instructions on installation and it is a piece of cake to install and it stays up!! So far it is a great product!</li>
    <li> This is the second one we&#x27;ve purchased!  We now have one for our master bath AND our guest bath.  Works just as advertised.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical that this would work as well as my old, discontinued shower mirror.  But it works great!  Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> The mirror is fantastic and works exactly as advertised.  It will literally change your life.  Shaving is now a joy instead of a chore (because it&#x27;s effortless and I get to be in the shower a bit longer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative is that it does look a bit cheap (plastic), especially in contrast to a sophisticated, modern bathroom.  But such is life.  I find it so indispensable that this is a secondary concern.</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews chose this one.  Following the instructions exactly was easy to put up. allowed  a little more than the 24 hours to set but has been up now for over a month. love the fogless feature. now I can see what I am doing when washing my face.</li>
    <li> I have had this for almost a year and it is fantastic. The only issue I experienced is some faint water marks, which I suppose is natural for this kind of product. Otherwise it has remained clear. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Just got this mirror and it&#x27;s great for shaving. I don&#x27;t even need to fill it with hot water. I just splash a handful of water on it and... I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
    <li> I got this for Christmas. Wife purchased it from amazon, knowing I would love something like this.&lt;br /&gt;When I found out how much she paid I was a little annoyed. This item should be 10 bucks... 15 dollars MAX.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not rate it 5 stars and call it \\&quot;fantastic, amazing OMG, and perfect\\&quot; like many of these reviewers. Maybe we are so let down by cheap chinese junk that when something decent comes around, people act like its great? Yes, it is a mirror that attaches to the wall. Its not perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Its a shower mirror. Thats basically what I was wanting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The adjustment bracket on my unit is extremely hard to use, and I do not feel confident that it will last a year. You have to use both hands and a surprising amount of force to position it at the desired angle. This takes a few attempts because the force required might actually adjust it too far, so you have to backtrack. The cracking sound it makes is frustrating because I keep thinking the dumb thing just broke.&lt;br /&gt;Now the mirror... it distorts. You can shave if you get really close to the mirror and if you are dead center. If you sway a little bit, your image begins to morph and distort like a funhouse mirror. Yes its not extreme, but it is annoying. Before I got this mirror I used my wifes circular shaped mirror which is roughly the same size with no problems. I did have to rig it so that it was attached to the shower caddy I have hanging from the shower head, but it worked with no distortion.&lt;br /&gt;I wont list its lightness and visibly cheapness as a con, because it should be engineered to be light in order to be positioned to a shower wall with the adhesive to avoid it from falling down.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had many of these shower mirrors over the years and this is by far my favorite.  Anyone who uses them knows the frustration when the fog-free film on the cheaper mirrors wears off.  You can buy spray to refresh them, but it&#x27;s expensive and a constant pain.  This mirror went up easily and is holding great to my fiberglass shower.  I assume it would hold equally well to tile, but can&#x27;t comment on that.  It just takes a second to fill with hot shower water and you are good to go.  The squeegee is a nice touch to give you a spotless mirror. I actually only use mine at the end of the shower after I dump the water -- just so it dries without water spots.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 2 months and am very pleased. I didn&#x27;t know what to expect regarding installation..I assumed it would be a suction cup system. This unit is installed using a small tube of silicone adhesive and double sided tape. (all included in the box). The written instructions are very clear, and there are markings on the rear of the unit to guide you.  Make sure the tile surface is clean (no soap film) and dry. It is suggested to use some alcohol to make sure the surface is dry. (alcohol not included). Use ALL of the silicone as instructed. I followed all instructions and am pleasantly surprised at how well attached the mirror is to the tile. The unit is definitely fog-less. To achieve this, there is a hollow space behind the mirror that must be filled with hot water when you use it. At first I thought this to be inconvenient, but it takes less than 10 seconds to lift the mirror from its bracket and hold it under the running stream of water from the shower. The included squeegee is also a nice touch and easy to use. With my old mirror, I had to use a spray cleaner before each shower to get the mirror usable...and the result was not very good. I highly recommend the ToiletTree fog-less mirror.</li>
    <li> I got this for my hubby and this is probably our 4th shower mirror...This one is the BEST!  By far the best we&#x27;ve ever had.  Maybe our shower is big enough that it doesn&#x27;t get foggy, but I don&#x27;t even have to put water in the holder on the back.  Very clear and the squeege works great.</li>
    <li> I checked this and other &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; mirrors and ended up picking this one out.  I have had numerous &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; mirrors and I like this one the best.  Even though you have to fill it with warm water, this is process is very easy to accomplish and it does keep the mirror from fogging up.  The squeegee works very well removing  the water on the mirror.  And the mirror itself is nice and big...better than other mirrors that are out there.  I like this product so much that I am ordering another for our Beach House.</li>
    <li> The mirror works great. You fill it each time with warm tap water and it remains clear. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> So I got this as a gift.  Shaving in the shower (head &amp; face) was all about the feel of the stubble and any missed spots.  Only after getting out and looking in the mirror close up could I see where I missed.  Now I don&#x27;t have to wait.  This product doesn&#x27;t get fogged up once you load it with hot water from the shower (very easy).  I found it the instructions simple to hang it initially.  Would I have preferred not to glue it to my tile, yes, but i also realize that no suction cup would hold (I have one of those massive ones that they used to sell on TV - it still falls down every once &amp; a while).  For the price ($30 or so) it is worth it.</li>
    <li> Do teen boys really need to look at themselves in the shower too?? I guess so because this mirror was at the top of my 16 year old son Christmas list. It stays fog free and attached securely to the bathroom wall. My only complaint is it seems to increase my son&#x27;s time in the shower time.....but I think that is more of a parenting issue than a product issue:-D</li>
    <li> I bought the similar mirror for my husband before, so after a couple of years when it became spotty and foggy I knew I want another one that works with the same \\&quot;reservoar\\&quot; system as that makes the most sense. I was really impressed when it arrived and my husband really like it. We positioned it away from the shower head this time so hopefully it won&#x27;t get as wet when not in use like the previous one. I like the silicon option as I hate when I hate to worry if the mirror will fall down after a while or not. So far, very happy with it!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this is our steam shower. It stays on the wall, and it works amazing! Get it now</li>
    <li> This mirror does not fog. The system actuals works. And the adhesive used to attach it in the shower also really works. That was what I was skeptical about but its been there for a month now and works just perfectly. One design flaw, the tank for the water is a little large. I think it could use less water and get the same good results. I feel quilty tossing all that water down the drain every day. So now I&#x27;m putting it in the cats bowl.</li>
    <li> Great product. The mirror is easy to mount and works great every morning. I&#x27;m a little concerned with how easily it can be removed come that time and if it will leave marks on the shower wall. But in the mean time, it works great.</li>
    <li> This mirror does exactly everything it claims. It does not fall. It does not fog up. It is easy to clean. Couldn&#x27;t have a more perfect product!</li>
    <li> The item works like it was described. My son loves it, now he can shave in the shower. It does not fog up when there is not water in it.</li>
    <li> The installation was easy, albeit you need to used the supplied glue and wait 24 hours for the glue to dry before using this mirror in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has great form and function. Only four stars because 1) I wish the tray underneath the mirror had a hole to hang razor, or was a little bigger.  The mirror length squeegee supplied takes up most of the space on the tray/shelf. 2) The tilt mechanism is a bit jerky and I am concerned it may break if moved many times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than those minor things that have room for improvement I must say this is the best performing fog free shower mirror I have ever tried. Once I set the tilt so I can see my entire face for shaving I don&#x27;t think I will be adjusting it again. Note that you do need to fill the mirror cavity with hot water while you are in the shower. That is what makes it fog free. You simply dump out the water when you are done with shaving then fill it up again the next time. I have tried mirrors in the past that hook up to the shower head or other water source, but they always eventually leaked or failed. This mirror seems like it will work for years with very minimal effort.  Great simplistic design.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a number of shower shaving mirrors over the years and this one may well have been the lowest price.  Having said that, it works great and does not fog when you fill it with warm water, as per the instructions.  It was easy to install, easy to use and the supplied squeegee works great, too. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> OK, the OCD in me tells you that you should seriously consider this product if you are in the market for shaving mirror.  Although the cheaper ones will stay fogless (for a short while), this one stays fogless for a LONG time (up to 30 minutes).  Takes the &#x27;rush to shave&#x27; out of the way.  Also, let&#x27;s talk quality.  This is a quality product. It comes with a squeegee ..... what OCD wouldn&#x27;t LOVE that! Use it, and each time you get in the shower, NO water spots (from the previous shower) on the mirror.  Buy this and you will say \\&quot;yea, that was worth the money, and then some.\\&quot;  I NEVER write reviews.  This is the FIRST product I have felt strongly enough to do so. What&#x27;s that tell you? Buy it, and enjoy it!</li>
    <li> great product and shipping was pretty good so cant complain about anything about this item or the retailer.The only thing I wish I didnt have to do was fill it with the shower water even though  I tried it without filling it and it seemed to be fine without fog.</li>
    <li> The mirror is well constructed, and looks like it belongs in our shower.&lt;br /&gt;Customer service was attentive and prompt.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the unlighted version, and it should suffice for all, but the darkest of shower stalls.</li>
    <li> This is a good quality in shower mirror. The hubby mainly uses it but the tilt feature makes it easier for me to use it as well since I&#x27;m a foot shorter then he is.</li>
    <li> This is the one product I wish I came up with! It has the &amp;#34;duh&amp;#34; factor, like &amp;#34;why didn&#x27;t I think of that&amp;#34; but has the price point that I don&#x27;t even care because I can buy it. Just do it, but note: make sure you pour the water out after you&#x27;re done because the person that gets in after you and has to pour that cold water out that splashes up is not going to be happy...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased at least a half-dozen so-called fogless mirrors in the last decade, but this is the first that actually does not fog up while I&#x27;m in the shower.</li>
    <li> the tilt stayed up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does everything as promised and is surprisingly sturdy, A pretty awesome product that saves me from cleaning hair off my bathroom counter all the time, but after filling and emptying the water reservoir a few times it no longer holds a proper tilt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you put it up high because once you mount it once there is no going back.</li>
    <li> The fogless feature of this product really does work perfectly.  It&#x27;s such an elogant solution to the problem of a fogging mirror.  I use to have a portable fan blowing toward my old shower mirror, which not only didn&#x27;t work well, it also made me very cold!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mirror doesn&#x27;t fog even under the most intense steam, which is how I take my showers now when I intend to shave.  The hot water and air really make for a much better shave with no razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down side is that the installation does require you to use silcone adhesive (enclosed with product) on the back of the mirror mount and to prep the area to which you&#x27;re going to attach the mirror mount.  It takes about 15-20 minutes if you&#x27;re really particular about getting nice even beads of silcone adhesive on the mirror mount and finding the right height/position for it&#x27;s attachment on the shower wall.  The benefit is that the mounting is secure- you don&#x27;t have to worry about suction cups coming loose, like with other products.  All said, it&#x27;s welll worth the time and effort to go through this process.</li>
    <li> Return purchaser. Have had the first one for several years and just bought a new one for a different location. Absolutely no negative issues. Holds water reservoir, always unfogged, no spotting on reflective mirror,  no slippage from glass surface.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these a few years back. Now we are moving and I need more for our new house. I&#x27;ve tried others but these are MUCH better.</li>
    <li> I had seen similar products advertised over the years, long before I had the capacity to shave my face (namely when I was a little boy traveling by airplane with mom &amp; dad). I always wondered how exactly a non-fogging mirror would function, especially whether a certain type of material was used to create the mirror or if a special substance had to be applied to the surface to prevent fog build-up. I decided to invest in this product because shaving outside the shower using just my bathroom mirror had become an annoyance. I reasoned it would be much more convenient to shave in the shower, and I proved myself correct. The mirror functions by use of a reservoir behind the mirror into which hot water is placed. The heat from the water prevents steam from accumulating on the mirror&#x27;s surface. The mirror comes with a small scraper, to remove water droplets that will build-up on it. This is not a bother at all, as the water droplets easily come off. I highly suggest this product. The price is really great (much cheaper than what it was selling for 15 years ago in the SkyMall Magazine) and works very well. Application to the wall of your shower is very easy, and the directions are completely straight-forward. This product is great for its convenience, use, and value.</li>
    <li> I have been a shower shaver for many years.  This is the first \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; mirror that really works.  It takes about a minute to mount it.  Follow the instructions and let the glue dry and you&#x27;re in business.  This product works.  I have been using it for a couple of weeks now and if you follow the simple instructions and fill it with water, takes about 5 seconds, it will not fog.  Great product, glad I spent the extra couple of bucks for it.  You get what you pay for and in this case I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> I shave my head.  Daily.  And for several years, about every couple months, I had to purchase another mirror at department stores because the &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; it claimed, would fog up.  It&#x27;s impossible to shave when you can&#x27;t see yourself &#x3D;).  So I took to trusty Amazon to look for yet, another replacement.  When i came across this mirror by ToiletTree, and saw that the reviews were 5 star with over 1000 ratings, I gave it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now and I&#x27;m completely satisfied by what it claims and how it works.  I have yet to even see a &amp;#34;start&amp;#34; of a fog.  It has done what it has promised and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides not fogging up, the ability to tilt the mirror was just incredible and as an added bonus, the squeegee to start you off. (to get rid of water spots.. not fog).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY thing I would recommend to make this product even better is an upside down guide on the back.  The same guide that&#x27;s used to support the mirror, have another upside down and off to the side.  So when you drain out the water, you can store the mirror upside down to prevent any deposits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> The product is well made and is designed to stay up on the shower wall (so far, so good!).That was the biggest problem with the previous suction cup version that I owned for several years (waking up suddendly in the nighttime when it crashed down, was not fun, and it earned me several bad looks for days from my spouse and dogs!). Its a clever design to use the hot water of the shower inside the mirror to keep the fog away (this works very well), but it&#x27;s a slight hassle to fill up and replace every shower usage (but, like I said, it works!). The mirror assembly that is removable is very light which is also a good design feature. The only reason I did not rate this 5 stars is that the mirror should have been made more useful for close up viewing (it tends to be more of a wide angle lens, in fact). This is not ideal for shaving the face area. Overall, a great product though...</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband&#x27;s birthday for our shower. He holds up a small hand mirror to shave. It arrived in a timely fashion. Got a great price on it! I hung it on our shower wall myself, following the easy instructions and it really does not fog! I recommend this product. It&#x27;s still in place 4 months later.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my husband and he loves it.  Was skeptical at first, due to experiences with other mirrors in the past that fall or fog, but has actually complimented the mirror and has thanked me for it several times now.</li>
    <li> The gears have help up. It really stays fogless. I moved and had to buy some new tape for it but other than that it&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if a fogless shower mirror would work our for me but I am extremely happy with this. it was very east to mount. it is very easy to use. Just fill the reservoir with hot water and you get a fog free mirror for the duration of your shower. Just remember to empty it when you are done! (not that anything bad happens if you don&#x27;t) Think carefully before you mount it as there are many things to consider regarding its placement.</li>
    <li> Worked okay for awhile. However, it gets grimy and becomes hard to see a reflection in after awhile. Also it may be &amp;#34;fog resistant,&amp;#34; but it is certainly not mold resistant. Maybe I am just irresponsible and don&#x27;t know how to take care of my things. Didn&#x27;t love it. That&#x27;s all I&#x27;m saying. It&#x27;s whatever.</li>
    <li> Best shower mirror I have ever used.  Easy to put up, easy to keep clean, NO FOG really works.</li>
    <li> installed for only six months, the mirror is breaking down and becoming a textured surface, looks as though there are hard water stains but in reality it is actually clean..</li>
    <li> This product is all that it is advertised to be.  The mirror truly is fogless and the installation is simple and fast to do.  Don&#x27;t waste, your time or your money, looking at other shower mirrors.  This is the one you want to buy.  Great Product!</li>
    <li> This is the second time we have purchased this item and it is absolutely fantastic.  So simple in design and concept but 100% perfect in how it works.</li>
    <li> Husband loves it! Works great!</li>
    <li> Mirror definitely better  than others that I have tried before. I&#x27;m not very fan of the silicone to glue it in my shower but it keeps it in its place.</li>
    <li> After reading so many great reviews about this mirror, I can&#x27;t find anything else to add.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mechanics of this mirror are like this. It is a semi-permanent install. Your shower needs to have a surface that double sided tape and clear silicone can stick too. If it doesn&#x27;t have that kind of surface you will need to prep the surface by lightly scuffing the surface with sandpaper, emory board or other appropriate abrasive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The double sided tape does the immediate bond to hold the mirror in place, the silicone makes the long lasting bond. I was able to pull this off the tile at my old place reapply some new double sided tape to the bracket and some fresh clear silicone and 24 hours later it was ready for service again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that thermodynamics are the deciding factor to the efficacy of this system as opposed to anti-fog agents which never last.  Other oft mentioned and luauded features. Mini silicone squeegee for wiping splash off the mirror, the mini razor shelf and the 15 degrees of mirror tilt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a great purchase for myself and a great gift idea for anyone who shaves in a bathroom either in or out of a steamy shower.</li>
    <li> This shower mirror does what so many have not before it... It stays fog free during my ridiculously long showers. I only wish I had bought the one with the lights, as I tend to miss spots when they are illuminated.</li>
    <li> Best Shower mirror ever. Works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Easy to install. Add hot water to prevent fogging. Use the included squeegee to clean. What could be easier? I got the Command Strips with it, in case I want to move it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice mirror with a razor shelf and squeegee.  I installed it per the directions that came with it.  The directions said to wash the area, dry it well, and use ALL of the silicon adhesive.  I washed the area, dried it well, and used all of the adhesive.  At the end of a week, it fell off the wall.  Any suggestions?</li>
    <li> Works just as described, never fogs!  It is a pretty permanent mounting solution with sticky tape and silicone so make sure you get it right the first time!</li>
    <li> Purchased this item for husband for Christmas. Within 1 month it had signs of moisture behind the \\&quot;mirror\\&quot;. Now, after 4 months, it is completely corroted. After contacting Amazon, we had immediate reply from both Amazon and Toilet Tree both offering quick resolve. We rate them with 5 stars for customer service.</li>
    <li> I have searched years for a shower mirror that doesn&#x27;t fog up. This product works. Putting water behind the mirror is a breeze and works every time. Wish I found out about it years ago. No other product compares.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Easy install.  Definitely fogfree.  After using several others through the years, best one yet.  Would highly recommend to friends in the future.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my husband. He loves the fact that there is a spot for his razor and shave cream built in. the squeegee is a great addition, too.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the mirror. It does not fog up at all and and light helps to give me a clear, sharp image for shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only con I have (and its a small one) is that I wish it had a hook for a razor. The little shelf is nice, but it holds the squeege.</li>
    <li> Product was delivered on time.  It is always nice to have a mirror in the shower to be able to see what you are doing, its a great product, the only thing I do not like about it is that it has to be glued so you cannot move it around.  Other than that, works great, it does not fog at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving in the shower for many years and have been through about 6 other brands and I&#x27;d say this is the best one yet. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was because of the need to use caulk to mount it.</li>
    <li> No fogging to date; have used for a month&lt;br /&gt;Easy maintenance with squeegee.&lt;br /&gt;Putting hot water behind the mirror seems to be the clever invention</li>
    <li> This mirror is exactly what I expected from reading the product description and positive reviews. I&#x27;ve been looking for a mirror that performs this well for many years and have owned several that have not performed nearly as well. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> yes, that&#x27;s the only way it becomes a fogless shower mirror. If you put hot water inside the container behind the mirror. You have to do this everytime and it works fine when you do otherwise its useless.</li>
    <li> This is an elegant solution to shaving in the shower.  Even \\&quot;fog free\\&quot; mirrors fog up a little.  You need warm water behind it, and this model requires no plumbing connection and is very easy to install.  Another reviewer said that the plastic mirror distorts unless you are close; well, you are close when you shave!  I&#x27;ve never noticed any distortion.  I give 5 stars because I can&#x27;t think of any shortcomings.</li>
    <li> This is just a plastic mirror with a bucket behind it to fill with hot water from your shower.  That&#x27;s the mystery science behind it.  You have to re-fill it every time you use it, because the water in it has to be hot enough to not allow steam to condense on it.  The tilt mechanism is a joke.  It looks cheap, it feels cheap.  I am highly suspicious of all the 5 star reviews for this item.  Anyone, even someone who liked it, would have to be insane to give it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please vote this and all the 1 star reviews up so they show on the main page!  The people deserve to know!</li>
    <li> Mirror works great.  I foolishly did not realize you needed to fill the back with hot water before using.  This takes all of 3 seconds.  If you do that the mirror works perfectly.  Not realizing I needed to do that, I though the mirror was worthless.  I received a caring and concerned response immediately on how to fix my stupidity (error).  AWESOME service and an even better product.</li>
    <li> My order was shipped on time. The installation is simple. I bought this for my dad and he loves it. He has not owned it long enough to know how long it will last but it seems very durable.</li>
    <li> my husband does not like the fact that he has to dump water out every time he uses it. also it would be better with lights on it, so he could see better.</li>
    <li> My wife bought this mirror and i thought she had wasted her money until I put it in the shower and used it: it works great!</li>
    <li> After trying numerous shaving mirrors in my shower this one really does the best job.&lt;br /&gt;Never fogs up and adheres to tiles perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;A wonderful product!</li>
    <li> i have probably purchased 4 or 5 shower mirrors over the years and all failed miserably. this mirror is works flawlessly. I jus keep a cup in shower and when i get in i pour a cup of warm water in back or mirror and it stays fogless the entire time im in shower jus as advertised. Theres no need to take mirror on and off wall, jus drill a tiny hole in bottom and its usually done draining shortly after im out of shower. highly recommend !</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS MIRROR. I HAVE PURCHASED PRODUCT AFTER PRODUCT LOCALLYAJD NONE OF THEM WERE FOG FREE AND CLEAR. AFTER READING THE OTHER REVIEWS WITH HELPFUL HINTS I FOLLOWD THE DIRECTIONS PROVIDED IN THE BOX TO A &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; AND HAVE HAD NO PROBLEMS.</li>
    <li> I have a facial procedure that is best done in the shower.  This product looks and works terrific.  My son put me on to the idea of a shower mirror because he uses one to shave, however, his product has always fogged up.  Filled with hot water, this product stays perfectly clear, and it looks great too.  Thanks for a great product.  I plan to give several next year as Christmas presents.&lt;br /&gt;Lenora from the Mississippi gulf coast.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had several shower mirrors over the years.  This one is the best by far for being fog-less.  The design is simple and it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Easy to install, lasts forever! Arrived fast! Easy to use.. Just have to empty water and refill. Great shower mirror, we love it</li>
    <li> This is the best shave mirror I have ever owned and I&#x27;ve been through several since I shave my face and head everyday in the shower. I highly recommend this mirror to anyone that shaves in the shower.</li>
    <li> Nope...better than good! Best &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; mirror I have ever used. Adheres easily, adjustable angle, great backlight and even comes with a squeegee! Super product!</li>
    <li> Finally a mirror that is actually well made for use in the shower. The self-storing squeegee is a great tool. The base of the unit stays fixed to the shower wall with a quasi-permanent silicone paste (it&#x27;s not hard to install), so no more unreliable suction cups. And, as long as you put hot water in the chamber behind the mirror, it truly stays unfogged--depending on the length of time you need to use the mirror per shower, you may need to reload it with hot water a second time because the water eventually cools. I am very happy with this product</li>
    <li> As advertised, this mirror does stay fog free in the shower.  It takes filling it with hot water and then clearing it with the squeegee but it does work.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST shower mirror by far! Foggles and doesn&#x27;t come crashing off the wall at all! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> My husband loves it. If used properly, does NOT fog. Very unobtrusive in the shower. Looks good. As far as installation - it was easy for my husband. As far as sticking to the shower wall . . . perfect! The secret to that is making sure all residue and grime is taken off the wall before applying anything.</li>
    <li> I like the mirror and it&#x27;s easy to use. Wish it was a little bigger and wish I had better lighting in my shower. But it works well.</li>
    <li> Based on the prior reviews I was looking forward to receiving the mirror.  Unfortunately, it has not met expectations.  The good news:  The top half of the mirror is clear and fog free.  The bad news:  The bottom half of the mirror is 100% FOG.  Can&#x27;t see a thing.  The good news:  If I was shaving my forehead it would work perfectly.  The bad news:  I have no idea what I am shaving below my eyes.</li>
    <li> Great idea.  Never fogs and gives a clear picture of your face while shaving.  Easy to use and to keep clean.</li>
    <li> UPDATE: 5/19/13 - Based on what Steve from the company commented on review, I let my man know that since he didn&#x27;t read the directions he didn&#x27;t know what the reservoir was for. LOL... he&#x27;s in the shower now and I asked if he put hot water in it and if it worked.. and yes he did and yes it works and the comment &#x27;yeah it&#x27;s pretty freakin cool!&#x27; followed me down the hall while I shook my head with a smile. Thank you Steve for commenting and letting me know! :) I defiantly recommend this mirror, just know that you need to fill up the reservoir with hot water :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL review 5/18/13 - Ok.. so we wanted a larger size mirror because my guy is now shaving his head. Although this is a &#x27;fogless&#x27; mirror.. it still fogs up. HOWEVER if you keep your vent on in the bathroom it doesn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m not sure how something could be completely fogless.. but overall we like this compared to other mirrors we have tried. :)</li>
    <li> The product arrived in a very timely manner, well packaged, and easy to follow instructions for installation.  As far as the mirror itself goes, it is excellent.  Easy reservoir to fill with hot water and then no fogging.  So far so good! Not only no complaints but nothing but good things to say for the price you can&#x27;t beat the value and function!</li>
    <li> This is my third try at a shower mirror.  I believe this is a winner.&lt;br /&gt;Sticks better than lame suction cups, nice big mirror, and works well.</li>
    <li> This product makes shaving so much easier. I always used to shave outside with hair cutters while i cut my hair (to get rid of the long facial hair) then shave the little rough specs off with a regular shaver over the sink to get a closer shave but I am always rough in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being able to shave in the shower while my pores are open allows for me to get the best shave I can get and I still have a smooth baby face the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This never gets foggy why i am in the shower when i fill it up with hot water. This is a lot nicer then having to spray some type of coating on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend you get the one that has a light on it over this one if you don&#x27;t have a light right above your shower.</li>
    <li> This mirror met my expectations.  I do not have a problem with distortion as other reviewers mentioned.  I like the fact that it is not glass, as dropping it and having it break on my shower floor is what I was trying to avoid.  It was easy to install, and functions well.</li>
    <li> The hot water reservoir is a great innovation and lasts longer than the other mirrors which lose their power over time.  And the squegee is a nice touch.  But the silicone just gave out and the thing crashed to the floor and broke.  Darn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But you know what - I&#x27;m gonna buy another one, because it&#x27;s better than the other brands.</li>
    <li> The short version: Buy this mirror!  (or the lighted version)  You will not be disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To put it simply, the mirror works.  It remains fixed to the wall, is easily cleaned, and provides a fog free mirror for shaving during morning showers.  I shave my head and facial hair every other day or so in the morning, and have been using this mirror for about a year.  I&#x27;ve found it best to fill the mirror when I require it, and to empty it afterwards.  I&#x27;m not always best at remembering to empty the reservoir which results in pouring out cold water onto my feet when I use the mirror next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have two other notes to make:&lt;br /&gt;1. The package arrived with a silicone adhesive tube which had partially dried.  I attempted to hang the mirror construct with the remaining amount, but it fell the next day during its first use.  I contacted the product manufacturer via email, and the president responded the same day!  They sent a replacement adhesive tube and mount within days.  Utilizing the full tube has kept the mount properly in place during my year of use.  THANK YOU SO MUCH TOILETTREE, for an awesome product, and amazing customer service!&lt;br /&gt;2. In hindsight I should have purchased the lighted model.  The light in my shower is not bright, and while that makes for a cozy shower experience, lack of a bright light does not assist when attempting to shave.  This is not at all a detraction from this product, but rather an encouragement that potential buyers should carefully consider lighting conditions when deciding between this version and the lighted version.</li>
    <li> BeSt product to buy.  It completely changed my shaving experience.  I used to hate the days when I had to shave in front of the bathroom mirror after I got out of the shower.  Now I can shave in the shower with my perfect for less mirror and don&#x27;t mind shaving at all anymore. Very worth buying!</li>
    <li> The Fogless Shower Mirror securely adheres to my shower wall and doesn&#x27;t steam up.  It saves me valuable time in the morning, plus I get a closer shave.</li>
    <li> only one thing to consider: it occasionally steams up but a little splash of warm water clears it up for the duration of the shave.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it says it will do. I followed the simple instructions, figured out the best place to mount it in the shower, and it works great!! I wish I would have found this a long time ago. I would recommend to others, though, that they consider the LED illuminated version of this item, as my shower stall has lighting but it could use a bit more, which would be provided by the LED version. Other than that, I am very happy with this purchase, and found it easy to install and safe in the shower.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m torn on this review, because this is the second of these I have purchased in the last 3 years.  My first one was truly the only fogless solution I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  The issue on this newest one appears to be a slow leak where the mirror meets the frame.  It causes a drop of water to run down the mirror every couple of seconds.</li>
    <li> Purchased this because it was guaranteed to not fog up.  When used appropriately it doesn&#x27;t but after 6 months the mirror and the mirror paper started separating and now it looks terrible.  I think I would look for a different model because of this.</li>
    <li> I bought this item 15 month ago and still love it. If you have a tile wall this will work great. Additionally I had to move my mirror and went on the ToiletTree site to find out how to reattach the unit and in their FAQs it said they will send you a new mounting kit for free. I emailed them and received the kit in 6 days via mail for free. Works perfectly, cost effective and great customer service. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this item.</li>
    <li> My husband says that his life is changed from this product!</li>
    <li> I love this so far. This was easy to stick up, and has stayed so far. I hope this stands the test of time (at least a reasonable time). Typically with items like these the mirror material starts to wear off and the adhesive fails over time. I&#x27;ll update the product review in a few months and let you know how it&#x27;s doing!</li>
    <li> First, let me say that after more that 10yrs of struggling with shaving mirrors this has been one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever purchased, if only everything I bought served it&#x27;s purpose so well. I used to buy shaving mirrors maybe once every 2-3 months or so and I&#x27;ve own this for around 3yrs I believe. The only minor critisim I would offer is that when the mirror is full of water, it no longer holds it&#x27;s 90 degree position perpendicular to the wall and will fall to one of the other lower positions, perhaps to 135 Deg or so. Somehow the gears (for lack of a better word?) appear to have worn and no longer stays snapped in place? This is the only reason I would give it 4 instead of 5 stars, otherwise everything else is as good as the day I bought it.</li>
    <li> I am thoroughly satisfied with this shower mirror.  Finally a design that is simple but functional.  The mirror is very easy to take on and off it&#x27;s mount, as I remove it after every shower to empty the water from the reservoir.  The mirror itself is very clear after filling the reservoir with warm water, and has worked in even the steamiest of showers.  Haven&#x27;t found a real need for the &amp;#34;squeegee&amp;#34; yet - I can see find without it.  Installation was easy as well, and the amount of adhesive that was provided was the perfect amount to apply a generous portion to each &amp;#34;groove&amp;#34;.  I was originally contemplating one of the mirrors that actually has you connect it to the water supply line, but those are much more expensive and must be placed directly next to the shower head.  The only question left is durability - I&#x27;ve had it for a month. Definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The search is over. A wonderful product that I have been looking for for a long time.  Works perfectly. I decided to not use the adhesive and instead used one of those shelves you can hang in the shower.  Thanks for a great product.</li>
    <li> This mirror works very well. You take it off the wall mount stand and fill it with hot water from the shower then put it back on the stand. The hot water keeps it from fogging. Very easy very simple. My husband&#x27;s only complaint is that it is a little small.</li>
    <li> First and last shower mirror I will ever buy cause it gets the job done well. Can&#x27;t argue with the responses.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Lives up to its billing. I Fill it with warm shower water and in the few seconds it takes to slide it on the bracket and give it a quick swipe with the included squeegee I have a fog free mirror to shave with. I used Command strips to attach it to the shower instead of the included silicone adhesive. If I ever need to remove the mirror bracket just a pull on the strips and it&#x27;s released and no glue to clean up after.</li>
    <li> 1 year after purchase, this mirror no longer held its weight when full of water.  In other words, the mirror is tipped all the way toward the floor and will not stand up on its own, so it is almost useless.  I assume that the hinge mechanism wore out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, before the hinge wore out, I had noticed that it fogged much worse than when I got it new.  Now, I fill about 10% with hot water and have to lean down to see my neck in the mirror and shave really fast haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very happy when I got it, but now I am very not happy as it does not work well, the warranty period is up, and I don&#x27;t want to buy a new $30 mirror every year.  Seriously, be careful with this purchase if you don&#x27;t get it for a good price as it didn&#x27;t last long for me.</li>
    <li> This mirror is as advertised and does the trick.  Mounts easily to the wall and has a large surface making for great visibility.  I recommend.</li>
    <li> So I got my husband to start shaving in the shower a few years ago and had bought a cheap mirror at Walmart that suctioned to the wall of shower.  It would fall off and he would have to put soap on it to prevent fogging even though it was anti fog.  Now I bought this mirror for him for Christmas 2012 and he has been using it for 8 months now and loves it.  It is easy to fill whether you take the mirror on and off or if you use a cup like my husband does since we have one in shower for the kids.  He will never go back to the cheap mirrorS again.</li>
    <li> Worked great until the glue came undone.... will try to get more to hang back up</li>
    <li> Only to have the adhesive wear off the wall months later. The mirror itself is great but they should really work on a longer term way of having this remain on the wall.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as advertised. It&#x27;s brilliant in it&#x27;s simplicity. I&#x27;ll keep it until they come up with one that has a light. Then I purchase that one right away.</li>
    <li> My husband raves about this mirror.  It is the best shaving mirror he has ever used in the shower.  He really likes the anti-fog feature.  He had me buy one for both of our sons.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had mirrors that claim to be fogless class etc.  This thing looks good and does the job there is absolutely no steam on the mirror after you add the hot water to the back.  piece of cake installation too!</li>
    <li> Came quickly,  nicely packaged.  Other reviewers  complained about getting it to stick to the wall  and suggested additional tape, but we haven&#x27;t had that issue.  The mirror is sharp, without blurring, and it&#x27;s  super easy to fill with warm water to keep it from  fogging up.  The squeegee works well,  but  the best part is, the  mirror cannot rust, which had been the problem with all previous mirrors.  I  am wondering if I should have splurged  and gotten the mirror with the light... hmm.  Overall, a  great purchase for my husband.</li>
    <li> To big and to much fussing to make it work.  That being said it works as advertised. Not my 1st choice.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised, with subtle points very well thought out by the design/engineering team.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1) Simple - The anti-fog method is simple and reliable. It works every time and requires little intervention to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Squeegee - The included squeegee makes removing water/steam a breeze and even has a dedicated storage clip so you don&#x27;t lose it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Shelf - The unit has a little shelf below the mirror; perfect for a razor or toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Color Options - You can match this mirror with most bathroom schemes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) Easy &amp; Secure Mounting - This mirror uses foam and silicone adhesive to attach. This means it&#x27;s pretty much a permanent addition to your shower, but it ain&#x27;t going anywhere!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6) Detachable - This is seriously underrated. The mirror easily slides off of the mounting hardware and shelf, allowing you to easily fill the reservoir with hot water. It also makes cleaning the mirror and mount very easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) Bulky Depth - Obviously, the depth of this mirror is required in order to provide the anti-fog method (hot water reservoir), but it doesn&#x27;t detract from the fact that it&#x27;s still a bit bulky. If size is a major concern for you, you may want to check out other options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Plastic - The mirror is adjustable to height, but every time I change the height, I pray the plastic doesn&#x27;t snap; it simply doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s high-quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Mirror - Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the mirror is entirely functional, however it is easy to tell that it&#x27;s of lower quality. When I&#x27;m in the shower, I noticed subtle &amp;#34;waves&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;curves&amp;#34; in the mirror which very slightly distort your reflection. The upside of the acrylic mirror is that dropping the detachable mirror-portion from time to time has not broken the mirror, but again, this was at those cost of reflection quality. Oh, and the size is also sort of small; you have to stand a little back from the mirror to catch your entire head in its frame. Since I used to put my contacts in AFTER my shower, I had to change things up a little to use it seamlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this mirror greatly exceeds my experience with anti-fog coated mirrors. The hot water reservoir is great and works every time, and has not resulted in any deterioration of this mirror over the course of a year. It seems very well engineered-thought-out, but also seems constrained to cheaper construction in order to provide a better price-point. As of now, it&#x27;s DEFINITELY worth the $30 it cost me!catch your entire head in its frame.

    <li> Product works very well as advertised. I would say that my one worry will be what will happen if I ever want to remove the mirror because it is permanently attached to the shower tile. However, with the weight of the mirror when filled with water, I don&#x27;t think a suction cup would be strong enough.</li>
    <li> The item itself was ok....it wasn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;good fit&amp;#34; for my husband.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as intended.  Stays completely fog-less when used correctly.  I&#x27;ve had mine for quite a while now and it still works great.  Adheres perfectly to shower.  Mirror is still clean/clear.</li>
    <li> I have only used it for a few days, but so far it is great.</li>
    <li> Although initially the mirror worked well, especially after getting used to refilling the reservoir before each use, after the first month and onward, the water proved too heavy for the primary setting (generally parallel to the shower wall) on the stand/bracket and I had to either let it angle downwards or upwards in order for it to remain in place.  Neither of these positions was conducive to shaving, and since I had to glue the stand to the wall, I could not move it up or down to accommodate the new angle.  And the search for a good shaving mirror continues....</li>
    <li> The mirror itself is truly fogless. No complaints along those lines. I installed the mirror about a month ago, and the adhesive has since failed, causing the unit to fall into the tub. I followed the directions exactly and waited the full suggested interval before attaching the mirror to the bracket, so I was disappointed when it did not remain attached to the shower wall.</li>
    <li> This mirror is great and as long as you put water in the reservoir it is fogless.I love that it has a squeegee and it is self storing. The shelf works great to put a razor so it is easy accessible. It is very easy to put up and with the silicone and double sided tape it is not going anywhere. I have tried the mirrors with suction cups and they dont stay up. I also love that the mirror angles and you can change the angle my husband is taller than me so it works great for different users and uses. I would definitely recommend this mirror.</li>
    <li> I bought this over a year ago and it still works as advertised.  I frequently forget to throw out the water after im finished.  But it hasnt caused the bracket to move or go out of place.</li>
    <li> Best of the best and I&#x27;ve tried many</li>
    <li> Great product that works exactly the way they describe it.  Also, very sturdy on the shower wall which was a concern for me before buying it.</li>
    <li> Half of the mirror immediately fogged up.</li>
    <li> This is the second Fogless Mirror I&#x27;ve purchased. Actually the first one was a gift. The first one went in my shower and, after almost two years,  is still solidly hanging there. It works as advertised-- fog free for my shave. Installation was a snap and it has required zero maintenance. This one is a Christmas gift for my son-in-law.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product and this seller wholeheartedly.</li>
    <li> my son in law loved it&#x27;</li>
    <li> Best option for the shower. Thank you for an easy fogless option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We don&#x27;t have hard water so we don&#x27;t have to use the squeegee, but I absolutely love this product. Treating other options in the past with anti fog spray was useless. This is the easiest option to date. Wish it was a bit narrower...or offered the ability to remove the tray. Knock my elbows on it from time to time but it hasn&#x27;t broken!</li>
    <li> After reading several reviews about this product I decided to purchase one. I have to say this is the best shower mirror I&#x27;ve ever used. I must have bought 4 or 5 different kinds in the past and none of them come close to this. If I have any concerns it&#x27;s using the proxy glue on a shower that I&#x27;m only renting. Other reviews say this isn&#x27;t a problem so I&#x27;m hoping that&#x27;s the case.</li>
    <li> Useful mirror, easy to install, very clear.  Arrived promptly.  Only feature I would like would be a sturdier squeegee.  Otherwise it is a good mirror and makes shaving easy.</li>
    <li> Installation is easy.  Just apply silicone to the mirror holder along with the double stick tape all which are all supplied with the product.  Fill with warm water before shaving and the mirror will stay clear.  Some reviews commented the size of the mirror was too small.  I did not find that to be a problem.  Best mirror to have in the shower.</li>
    <li> I just moved and left my old anti fog mirror at old place. I had to order another one and was a little worried but then found this one.  It&#x27;s perfect, works way better than my old one.  I wish I replaced my old one years ago with this.  I can actually see my face completely clear. Only thing I wish they had was holders on each side for razors.  Only one spot for 1 razor where my other one has slots that you could hand several razors from.  Other than that this is perfect.  Oh another little minor issue is when it arrived the tube of caulk was hard as a rock, I called company and had new tube withing 2 days.  Great Customer service.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> This product works as advertised and is worth money in time savings to allow me to shave in the shower.  Easy to assemble and stays fogless.</li>
    <li> **UPDATE**  7 months in and the mirror is still tightly affixed to the shower tile and still works as well as day one. HIGHLY recommended.  ----------------  Shower mirror works as advertised and I&#x27;m impressed with ToiletTree as a company. Given the clear instructions included in the package (which are typo-free to boot) along with a follow up e-mail with customer service information as needed, I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase. The mirror mounts easily and effectively and, with the included razor shelf and squeegee, the mirror self-contains everything you need. The most important thing, though, is that IT ACTUALLY DOES *NOT* FOG UP and works as advertised! Within seconds of filling the reservoir with hot shower water, the fog disappears from the mirror and stays that way for the duration of the shower. Although it is more expensive than most mirrors, this is the only one that operates in this fashion and definitely works consistently without any maintenance.  Glad I finally bit the bullet and made this purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a nifty item that appears well made.  I have only had it for about a week so I won&#x27;t testify to it&#x27;s overall durability but I will say that so far it&#x27;s been great.  The whole water reservoir idea is smart and effective.  The installation is the only thing I think could use a little work.  The tubes of waterproof adhesive are unwieldy so I opted for using another manufacturer&#x27;s water resistant double-sided sticky tape and I&#x27;ve been shaving in the shower ever since.</li>
    <li> I saw this recommended in a website and I really liked it, it works exactly as told and it&#x27;s easy to install.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this shower mirror!  Perfect for men that like to shave in the shower!  Stays firmly in place.</li>
    <li> This is great.  Just know that it is an permanent install and not suction cups as I thought.  But it&#x27;s super sturdy on the shower wall.</li>
    <li> The mirror performs as advertised...Fogless.  However it does need a place to hang a razor rather than the too small ledge.</li>
    <li> This product is the best I have tried, of any brand.  It worked perfectly from the get go.  I have had no problems with the product and would highly recommend it to anyone who loves an excellent value.  It is built to last and is efficient as it out performs all other products like it.  You won’t regret this purchase.&lt;br /&gt; This product gets top ratings 5★s</li>
    <li> I have been using this mirror for roughly 4 years now. By far the most durable and easily the best design for a fogless mirror. The water reservoir behind the mirror guarantees a fog free shave. I&#x27;ve been shaving in the shower for quite a few years, and this is by far the longest I&#x27;ve ever kept any fogless mirror. It works today just the same as the day I installed it.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband for Christmas, he loves it! This is the second one we&#x27;ve bought. The mirror really does stay fogless when you add hot water to the little well behind it. Such a simple concept, works better than any so-called fogless mirror we&#x27;ve ever gotten. Just make sure you squeegee the mirror and the frame every time you use it or it does get spotty.</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome. You fill it with hot water and then use the little squeegee on the mirror. Really brilliant design.</li>
    <li> Once this thing is mounted and using the silicon I you have no issues of it staying in place. Fill up the mirror with water and it never fogs and the squidgy works perfect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving in the shower for 20 years, and I get a much better shave that way. My beard gets wetter and cuts more easily. I&#x27;ve tried a variety of creams and prefer the following (in no particular order): Cremo, Art of Shaving, Aveda, RS Cream (not gel), and Burts Bees. I splurged on an Art of Shaving razor -- it has a light which makes shower shaving easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the smaller of the two mirrors this company offers. The smaller one works better, since the lights stay bright longer (same # of batteries, smaller # of lights). The larger one seemed to need batteries every 2-3 weeks. The smaller mirror also fills more quickly.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;If you already have the larger mirror and are not happy, buy the smaller one --- it will fit on the mount you&#x27;ve already stuck to your wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t tried shaving in the shower yet, you really should -- I think you&#x27;ll be amazed at how much easier it is to get a good shave, and how much better your skin feels.</li>
    <li> my husband loves this! it really doesn&#x27;t fog up.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t mind filling the back with water each time, its a good product. The mirror stays fogless if you follow directions. Good product.</li>
    <li> Gave as gift to my husband. He likes the product but has trouble having it stick to the shower wall- it has fallen off a few times.</li>
    <li> Husband loves this. I was skeptical when I read some of the reviews that said it had a distorted view, but its a very clear mirror. It is made well. Would suggest to friends and family</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have purchased this mirror, and I am just as pleased as the first. The mirror works exactly as advertised, with no fog whatsoever condensing on the mirror surface. The construction is surprisingly solid for the price. With the included silicone, mounting is a breeze, and I have no worries about the mirror coming off the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative is that the mirror is smaller than the image on the box would suggest. However, I find the size perfectly adequate for shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone looking for a shower mirror.</li>
    <li> [Edit Aug 8, 2016 - It fell on it&#x27;s own today. Luckily it didn&#x27;t break, but need to buy new tape to stick it back up] Simple to use and install. It stays fog-free when filled with hot water. No batteries required. Good product!!!  They could have had an outlet at the bottom to drain water - that way, you wouldn&#x27;t have to take out the mirror every time.</li>
    <li> I love how easy it is to use, and I never have a problem with it fogging. Be prepared to wait 24 hours to use it after installation so that the silicon can set properly.</li>
    <li> poor quality of the mirror for the price, overkill product and too small also</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for about a year, and it worked as advertised for the first nine months or so.  The mirror stopped holding it&#x27;s position when filled with water a few months ago, and has gradually gotten so bad that it won&#x27;t stay up with any water in it at all.  I guess the bottom line is this thing is only designed to do one thing, and when it doesn&#x27;t do it, it&#x27;s a fail.</li>
    <li> (EDITED- See bottom).  This product worked perfectly for a year.  5 stars!! Then after a year, the pivot mechanism that allows the mirror to tilt up/down became loose and now its so loose that I have to shove the cap shaving cream behind the mirror.  Other than the loose pivot, this thing works great.  Would I buy it again?  Probably because it works relatively well and really I dont mind the shaving cream cap that much.  Overall, its a good product and I think you will be happy with it.    **************Edited****************  I received the new pivot piece sent to me shortly after the above review was posted.  Thank you for sending the new piece.  The shower mirror works perfectly again (without my shaving cream cap holding it up).  I recommended before, but I endorse now!  Thanks again!</li>
    <li> My husband always wanted a mirror to shave while he was having a shower. I&#x27;ve browsed many mirrors in different stores, and all of them seemed to be cheap and very low quality. Finally I found this one with great reviews and I bought it for him. He loved it!! Easy to install it in the shower, and very good quality. It looks great in our shower. It really works!!! Great purchase</li>
    <li> So far so good.  Install was simple and seems to be holding very strong.  I&#x27;m interested to see how it takes the hard water at home in the longer future.  I can see clearly now the fog has gone.  It&#x27;s gonna be a bright, bright, bright sunny shave.</li>
    <li> It was easy to install, easy to use, works exactly as it should. I have not had any problems with this. Zero complaints here.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised.  How nice to shave without constantly wiping off a mirror!  Great product.  Only wish I had gotten one years ago!  Buy one and see what you&#x27;ve been missing!</li>
    <li> Take it from someone who has owned several fogless shower mirrors, this is the real deal. The trick is to fill the thing up with hot water. No weird chemical coatings. And it works!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know that this item required the filling of a small tank with hot water in order to keep it from fogging.  Then, one has to slide it into a bracket of sorts that one mounts on the wall.  The actual mirror, is very dark, and very unclear.  The mirror has about 6 or 7 positions that one clicks into place to line up for good viewing of one&#x27;s face when shaving.  This worked for about a year.  Then, after this time, the weight of the water in the reservoir in the back of the mirror causes the mirror to constantly fall into the lowest position where one is unable to see one&#x27;s face in order to shave.  If one reduces the amount of water in the tank, the mirror stays put in the position one wants it in, but then the mirror fogs up.  This is very, very frustrating and disappointing.  It renders the mirror, which as I said, is not that bright or clear to begin with, virtually useless.  And, to add insult to injury, the bracket goes on the wall with such strong adhesive, that it appears impossible to remove from the wall, to replace it with a decent shaving mirror.  Above was my original review.   Soon after submitting it, I was contacted by the company and informed that several improvements had been made in the product (larger surface, and stronger, better holding bracket),and that the company wanted to offer me a replacement with the new version, free of charge.   The new mirror was better in that it stayed in the place that I set it at, and it was bit bigger viewing surface. However, the mirror is still made of plastic, and is still dark and a bit distorted...even with the tiny &amp;#34;lights&amp;#34; that surround it...they are totally useless.  But the new mirror stayed in the place I set it at, so I made due, and used it.  Also, I did appreciate that the company took note of my disappointment, and was kind enough to replace the product.  However, after some time( I&#x27;m not sure how long, but certainly not long enough   Long enough would be never) the mirror is back to falling when the reservoir is full, and I find it infuriating. Also, I&#x27;ve cut myself twice when I jumped as a result of the mirror suddenly dropping without warning.  The product, I&#x27;m sorry to say, has proved to be totally disappointing and useless in every way.</li>
    <li> Love it, works great!</li>
    <li> This mirror is exactly what we were looking for. It&#x27;s easy to install and works wonderfully in the shower. My husband uses it for shaving and loves it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple other fogless mirrors.  This one is the best by far.  Yes you do have to fill it up with water each time, and yes you have to stand close to it (but it&#x27;s a mirror, so I&#x27;m not sure what you expected), but these are minor issues compared to the quality of the product.  Great mirror for your shower.</li>
    <li> This one is great but I do wish I would have gotten the bigger one instead, product has held up very well.</li>
    <li> I just wanted to say that I have been very happy with my mirror.  The hinge started to go bad in it, and customer service very kindly sent me a replacement hinge which has been working fantastically.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to any friend. It works exactly as it is described in Amazon product details. It definitely earned my 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Amazing product, got one and then a second one after a couple of months for my other bathroom. After one year I had a small problem in keeping the mirror straight (in one of them); contacted costumer service and they sent me a reply within less than 2 hours (!) saying they would take care of that for me (send me a new mirror with no shipping costs).</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband and he really likes it. Installation was pretty simple and it doesn&#x27;t fog up at all, very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Although I was not particularly thrilled with having to glue the mirror to the shower wall with silicone glue, it works well enough to warrant a recommendation. If you wear glasses, as I do, you might have to feel your way through returning the mirror (after filling the well with hot water) back into the slot that holds it up. Otherwise a nice product.</li>
    <li> ToiletTree Fogless Shower Mirror makes shower shaving enjoyable and easy - a best buy after spending twice as much for products that failed.  Easy to install, easy to use an fairly priced.</li>
    <li> Well, after a few times of use, I got tired of the idea of filling up hot water in this boy.</li>
    <li> Easy to install, easy to set up and works exactly as advertised. Stays clear during the shave with a quick empty, it&#x27;s ready for the next event.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a couple months now and it works great.  I&#x27;ve gone through a couple \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; mirrors before but this by far works the best.</li>
    <li> I have been struggling for a half dozen years with a shower shaving mirror that continually fogged up during my shower. I&#x27;ve had this fogless shower mirror for two weeks and it works perfectly.  I am very pleased and a lot less frustrated.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a shower mirror to replace an old model that I have.  This product is as effective at maintaining a fog-free environment as it is simple to install.  If there was a sixth star (or more), I&#x27;d have checked that!</li>
    <li> Good product, well packed with air bubble paper in cardboard box.  Excellent mounting instructions for well-designed mirror that really does NOT fog in the shower.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I started shaving in the shower about 2 years ago.  I started with a mirror that connects to the showerhead.  It did Ok.  It did leave the water shooting at your face and required regular adjustment.  It would also waste water.  I the purchased a \\&quot;Fog Free\\&quot; mirror with an LED surrounding it from a store in the mall with high end gadgets.  It was held on with suction cups and would regularly fall off.  It was never fog free.  After it landed in a full tub one time, the light never worked.&lt;br /&gt;***This mirror is the best***&lt;br /&gt;1. Easy to install&lt;br /&gt;2. Adjustable direction if you have people of different heights&lt;br /&gt;3. Take 3 seconds to fill and replace from the main tub faucet.  8 to 10 seconds to fill from the shower&lt;br /&gt;4. Never fogs&lt;br /&gt;5. never falls&lt;br /&gt;6. Shelf for the razor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****I will have one of these in every shower I ever own/rent***</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this mirror for over a year now and I absolutely love it.  It is 100% fog free as long as you fill the reservoir with hot water and that&#x27;s pretty darn easy to do.  After about a year of use in my house with the very hard water that I have it was to the point where I could barely use it to shave anymore and I couldn&#x27;t get it clean with soap and water so I decided to risk it and try CLR and sure enough it cleaned it so well it looks brand new again!! I was really worried that CLR would be too harsh on it but it didn&#x27;t mess it up in the slightest so for those of you who were worried about this like I am, don&#x27;t be!</li>
    <li> this is the best fog-less mirro I have ever owned, I have been shaving in the shower for over 25 years and this mirror is easy and great for side-burns etc. , nose area, have only had it for 5 week&#x27;s hope this remains this way as the quarantee states !</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with the product and it was shipped to me quickly. I cannot wait to give it as a gift!</li>
    <li> Easy to mount and very high quality.  Looks like it will last a long while.  100% fog free once you fill it with hot water from the shower.  Includes mounting tape and silicon for a secure hold.</li>
    <li> All the comments are correct, and there is a reason why its a best seller. Works like a charm. My favorite part is the built in squegee which lets you wipe the surface of droplets.</li>
    <li> It might be guaranteed not to fog, but it didn&#x27;t stay on the shower wall for even a month!!  Then, once it fell, due to silicone application, there is no way to rehang on the shower wall.  HORRIBLE product!!!!!!  Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!!!</li>
    <li> bought as gift for my husband...fogs up easily after several uses- so much for the guarantee!  I was really hopeful this would work!</li>
    <li> it works SORT of like they say. the biggest problem is that once you get the hot water from the shower into the reservoir it distorts the plastic mirror. I use it by filling it with water and letting it sit in there for a while and then dump it out and it lasts long enough without fogging up to shave. The squeegee is a joke...nuff said about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bottom line is that it works but this thing should be about $10... definitely not worth $30</li>
    <li> Once you switch to shaving in the shower, you&#x27;ll never go back. It is so easy and the mirror is great. The fogless feature totally works. I never remove the mirror to dump or fill water. I just take the shower hose and blast new hot water in every morning.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not worth paying $30 for this product .It&#x27;s better than a regular mirror but the clarity is not very great under the shower. You should keep cleaning view the mirror.</li>
    <li> Lasted all of three months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Junk, Junk, Junk, Junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made in China is JUNK.</li>
    <li> purchased the mirror for my husband who likes to shave in the shower. Works great and was easy to install (he said).  There is a water reservoir in the back that you fill with hot water and that keeps the mirror from fogging up. Genius! or should I say science.  He just installed it and has used it once but it seems to be built well and, with no moving parts, should last a long time,</li>
    <li> I purchased this so I could shave in the shower...I find the mirror small and it is hard to use to really see much.  I have a beard and shave the top of my face and neck and I still prefer using the large sink mirror so I do not miss areas.  It is ok...but I think it is too small.</li>
    <li> The fog less mirror is amazing. It works great. I recommend it to everyone.  I had a different shower mirror prior to this one which was horrible.  This mirror works great and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Let me say I&#x27;ve used this mirror for OVER 2 YEARS now. And have gone through 2 of them and am now on my 3rd. Clearly I like them so I&#x27;ll tell you what I do and don&#x27;t like about them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives:&lt;br /&gt;+ Definitely FOGLESS, this design is the only way to truly get a fogless mirror in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;+ Securely attaches to the wall&lt;br /&gt;+ Tilt function&lt;br /&gt;+ Price, while $25 isn&#x27;t exactly a giveaway, nothing else competes at this pricepoint&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;- It is all plastic, not a bad negative, but don&#x27;t expect solid construction and plan on replacing it (see below)&lt;br /&gt;- Adhesive is difficult to remove. If you ever need to move, you will need to remove the silicone which is tough to remove and if renting could result in damage fees&lt;br /&gt;- The tilt function eventually gets &amp;#34;weak&amp;#34; and requires purchasing a new unit or else the mirror will fall into the most downward facing position when full&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;This is a great mirror as long as you understand the removal process requires some work. A razor blade and some goo-gone will NOT do it. Also wish the construction of the tilt mechanism was more solid construction instead of plastic that wears out in a few months causing the mirror to be stuck in the downward position. All-in-all though, for $25 I don&#x27;t mind buying a new one about every year. Don&#x27;t expect this to be one of those products that lasts a lifetime, and if you do remove it, expect a hassle. I give it 4 stars because it truly is fogless, the price is right, but the product needs to be more durable for a 5-star review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: keep in mind I have been using this product for years, unlike other reviewers who have been using it for a couple weeks. Sure I would&#x27;ve given it 5-stars then as well, not knowing how it would break and be hard to remove. So I hope this helps give you the full picture!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATED REVIEW: SELLER UPDATED THEIR PRODUCT! The product was updated in that the entire back side is now a &amp;#34;sticker&amp;#34; that you peel off and stick to the wall, instead of the silicone adhesive that was previously used. This is good for being easier to remove from the wall, but worse in that the sticker isn&#x27;t re-usable vs the old style you could just apply more silicone adhesive.ow a &amp;#34;sticker&amp;#34; that you peel off and stick to the wall, instead of the silicone adhesive that was previously used. This is good for being easier to remove from the wall, but worse in that the sticker isn&#x27;t re-usable vs the old style you could just apply more silicone adhesive.</li>
    <li> The top notch reviews on Amazon influenced me to buy this product, as did the obvious stellar customer service provided by the manufacturer.  So far I like the product very much.  It was easy to install and is an ingenious design. I like it!</li>
    <li> The stellar reviews are accurate - this lives up to it&#x27;s claims.  Very easy to use and doesn&#x27;t fog up.  Using hot water for fog proof function is great idea.</li>
    <li> this is the only shower mirror I&#x27;ve found for my husband that stays put and doesn&#x27;t fog up! its a keeper</li>
    <li> Product works well but the plastic gear which angles the mirror wears off. I only use it twice a week and my girlfriend uses it once a week (when she visits).&lt;br /&gt;8 months later, mirror won&#x27;t stay in place because the gear won&#x27;t hold it in place. I have no use for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$30 for this product is not worth it. Didn&#x27;t last 1 year.</li>
    <li> I love shower mirrors. Over the years I mostly had the type that mounted on the shower head. Those seemed OK for a while, but eventually, the reflective surface clouds up and the design does reduce shower head volume. I now own 2 shower mirrors from ToiletTree. These are simply a better idea. No shower head mounting. Easy to install. My oldest one is 3 years old and still looks new. 5 stars from me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different fogless shower mirrors in the past.  This product is far superior over any one them.  It&#x27;s a pleasure to shave and not worry about the mirror suction cup not holding.  My tile is porous, and it is secure!!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect for shaving in the shower.  I was skeptical that this would actually work, but it totally does.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I bought htis to convert from a mirror that attached to my waterline and the the mirror to it.  It gave me pretty faithful service for teh last 4 years or so, but it was cumbersome and extended the shower head by about 6 inches.  I did pay over $79 for it years ago and this mirror out performs it so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROs&lt;br /&gt;- Adjustable Mirror Tilt&lt;br /&gt;- Mount where you want it, not tethered to a water source&lt;br /&gt;- Handy squeegy and even handier storage location for it.&lt;br /&gt;- Once filled with warm shower water, does not fog at all&lt;br /&gt;- Easily Removes to fill&lt;br /&gt;- Nice little shelf for a razor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-None to date. Absolutley works as descrtibed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for an inovative way to fix a problem we shower shavers have fought with for years.</li>
    <li> Just received a few days ago, but so far I love it.</li>
    <li> This is really genius! You know it&#x27;s a great idea when you wish you thought of it! I bought a few &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; mirrors in the past but they always fogged up. Taping this mirror to the wall was easy, I&#x27;m not sure if it will come off easily too because I didn&#x27;t do that yet. I loved this so much, I even bought the travel size because I&#x27;m a drummer that goes on tour often and would love to use it in the shower at the hotels. The only thing I wish it had was magnification... I would easily give it 5 stars then. Lighting would be nice too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few weeks now.  It was easy to mount to my smooth, wrap-around style shower/bath tub wall.  Hasn&#x27;t fallen yet.  Minor inconvenience having to fill it up with hot bathwater prior to use but what are you going to do.  It stays completely fog free though not spritz free (how long do we need to wait for one with a force field to solve that).  I kind of wish I had bought one that was illuminated (my shower is pretty dark) but didn&#x27;t want to pay the extra cost and didn&#x27;t want to mess with replacing batteries.  The picture of the mirror is great I think.  If you really scrutinize there is some distortion as it does seem to be a plastic mirror.  The size is good enough for me (though bigger is always better).  All in all, I am very happy, can tell a difference in my skin from being able to shave in the shower, and think it saves some time in my morning routine.</li>
    <li> Awesome. Works great. Husband loves it. I was skeptical but true to advertising and reviews, this is indeed a fog-free mirror that sticks to the shower wall.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy any fog-free mirror that works using a surface coating alone. They all break down within a few weeks of use. This product, however, uses warm water to keep the mirror the same temperature as the shower and never fogs. I&#x27;ve been using mine for a few months and it is works perfect every time.</li>
    <li> I bought this fogless mirror as a gift for my boyfriend, and he loves it!  He says it&#x27;s very easy to use and does stay fogless for the duration of his shower.  It was easy to attach to the wall, and he likes the little shelf to rest his razor on.  Not sure if he uses the squeegee or not, but I like that it slides right into the shelf.</li>
    <li> I have gone through so many so called &amp;#34;fog free&amp;#34; mirrors that all fogged up horribly. After reading the reviews on this one, I took a chance and have been really satisfied so far. I add hot water before or during the shower and the mirror stays fog free. My only issue is keeping the mirror stuck to the wall; seems like the tape didn&#x27;t cut it alone so I have mine sitting on a towel rack inside the shower and stall and that helps. So far, so good.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband. He was tired of mirrors constantly falling down and fogging up.this mirror doesn&#x27;t fall or fog up! Great product!</li>
    <li> After a few months the mirror surface flakes/peels off. It may be due to our hard (and heavily softened) water. Went through two and gave up. The razor tray and easy-fill top opening were really nice.</li>
    <li> A very nice product which allows me to have a very comfortable shave while enjoying the pleasant warm water of the shower</li>
    <li> Followed directions just as directed, now I get to look at myself while I&#x27;m showering and shaving. Don&#x27;t have to deal with hair in my sink again. Just don&#x27;t forget to put in warm water inside or it will fog up. This one is a no brainer for people who like to be efficient like me and the Germans.</li>
    <li> Just used this mirror for the first time, and while I&#x27;ve been doing my shaving in the shower for more than ten years, this mirror provided the clearest view, and the most relaxed, comfortable shaving experience I&#x27;ve had. Installation instructions were easy to follow and the mirror seems quite secure. It will be nice not to wonder when suction cups are going to drop a mirror on my feet.</li>
    <li> The fog free mirror is excellent when it comes to the mirror itself. The mounting of the mirror is something left to be desired. I followed the directions to the \\&quot;T\\&quot; and was mounting it on glass block, which it should adhere to the best. Sorry, after putting water in the mirror, which weighs it down considerably, the mirror fell off the glass.</li>
    <li> It is really easy to install and easy to use. This will help me save tons on blades.&lt;br /&gt;Just hot water and you are good to go.</li>
    <li> I owned one of these items in the past and I accidentally dropped it in the shower. Only the holding bracket in the back broke, but I was very thankful the mirror piece is NOT made of glass. Some reviewers here think that&#x27;s a negative, but I think it&#x27;s much safer. I love this product so I ordered another one and mounted it properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you follow the instructions and add hot water in the mirror reservoir, you will be able to use the mirror without it fogging while you shower.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly.  It has a reservoir behind the mirror that you fill will water from the shower. Brilliant! My husband loves it.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best fogless mirror I have ever ownded. My wife got this for me as a gift after my last one fell off the wall and broke. I&#x27;ve been shaving in the shower for more then 15 yrs, both my head and face, and this is the only mirror I can say is truly fogless.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t be mislead - the mirror does fog, but the squeegee removes the fog well. you may need to wipe it off every few minutes.</li>
    <li> My husband has been very pleased with how this product works.  It is a good size and truly does not fog up while shaving.  We would highly recommend and are pleased with our purchase!</li>
    <li> After trying several fog less mirrors with horrible results, I decided to give them up.  Several years later I did a search for one on amazon I saw the good reviews for this and thought I would try it.  It works!!  It&#x27;s a little bit of a hassle to fill up but it&#x27;s worth it. I now don&#x27;t miss any spots like I used to. Definately recommend this.</li>
    <li> My husband LOVES this mirror.  It does exactly as it says.  I would highly recommend this mirror over any other mirror on the market.  100% Satisfied!!</li>
    <li> My husband is always disappointed in these mirrors, so this one is a godsend. The design works perfectly and he is thrilled.</li>
    <li> Been looking for a fogless shower mirror that STAYS fogless for the past few years...and this one does, superbly.  Easy instructions for install on the bathroom wall and easy to use...and it tilts!  You will not be dissapointed with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas because he loves to shave in the shower. We have been through a countless number of mirrors claiming to be fog less that were not. This one works!  It is a permanent fixture so I was nervous about attaching it if it didn&#x27;t work but it does! Like others that have reviewed you do need to fill the back with water every time you use it but as soon as you do, no more fog! Ths for us was as simple as taking  the shower head to the reserve tank, so simple! But since the mirror just slides off the mount its no issue bringng the mirror to the shower to fill it up. Also, the squeegee is awesome! Easy to just swipe ver the mirror when you are done. And no water spots.  I also like that the ledge under the mirror nicely holds his razor. I find this mirror was one of the best gifts ever and solved a problem with fog less mirrors we have ad for years. Hands down the best mirror ever!</li>
    <li> We have purchased so many crappy so called fog less mirrors over the years that I just assumed this would be another in the line of lame attempts but my husband says it may be the best gift he&#x27;s ever gotten!  Finally, something that does what it says!  Also thrilled with hanging.  No more suction cups!!!!!</li>
    <li> I am extremely pleased with my shower mirror.  I just fill it will my warm shower water and the mirror NEVER fogs.  A snap to install in the shower and well worth the price!</li>
    <li> I like every thing about this shower mirror except for this simple fact they didn&#x27;t use strong enough hinges. It hasn&#x27;t been a year yet and the weight of the water tilts down the mirror and won&#x27;t stay up anymore.</li>
    <li> I shave in the shower.  I&#x27;ve tried numerous shower mirrors and they all fog up!  I was skeptical.  But I bought this mirror by ToiletTree.&lt;br /&gt;It is perfection.  It looks like a small flat screen television.  Classy.  And when you simply add some hot water to the tray, no fog.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> An excellent fogless mirror.  You need to fill-up the reservoir with hot water from the shower at the beginning of each use, but this only takes about 10 seconds.  And then the mirror never fogs!  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> TRULY a FOGLESS mirror.  If a review says it&#x27;s not fogless, then they have not followed the clear instructions to add warm or hot water to the reservoir.</li>
    <li> Edit: 5/12/13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saw response from company rep telling me I was not using this product correctly. I don&#x27;t remember receiving directions in the box telling me to fill it with hot water. Damn shame cause I really liked the build quality of the mirror &amp; wished it had worked. Considering purchasing another with this new information...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked this mirror due to the raving reviews. I wanted to shave in the shower, so purchased this product. Well constructed as it is, I found it to fog almost immediately &amp; the squeegee that came w it did nothing. I had to take shaving cream or conditioner, coat the mirror, rinse, then I could shave w just enough time before it fogged over again. Complete waste of my money.</li>
    <li> This Mirror works just as advertised.  It is lightweight and does not seem like it will ever fall of the shower wall, unlike its suction cup predecessor. Just add hot water to the small tank and the mirror is remains clear throughout your shave.  I have not yet had to use the squeegee to clear the mirror of fog or water.  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I needed to replace my previous supposedly &amp;#34;fog less&amp;#34; mirror and thank god I found one that really was fogless. It&#x27;s simple science and it works awesome. It was an ease to attach onto my shower glass. It&#x27;s important to really leave the base on the glass for 24 hours and let the silicone adhesive settle in. This is a must have for anyone in need of shaving in the shower or other grooming needs.</li>
    <li> Simple hot water keeps this mirror fogless.  Easy and quick to access squegee keeps water droplets off mirror giving a surprisingly clear view.</li>
    <li> Love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mounting: Easy! It STILL shows no sign of even thinking about falling off.&lt;br /&gt;Fun-house effect: I hadn&#x27;t even noticed any fun-house effect till reading some reviews here (a year later). It IS there but only when you&#x27;re viewing at the extreme edges of the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;Replacing the mirror onto the mount after filling: Maybe I&#x27;m just used to it but it&#x27;s a non-issue.&lt;br /&gt;Squeegee: Does the job... nothing great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to come up with a con it would have to be that I wish it were a tad larger. That said, if I broke mine today I&#x27;d be on Amazon tonight ordering the same exact one.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s it. It is what it is and does what it says it&#x27;ll do.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t believe any of the other products out there that pretty nearly engage in fraud by claiming themselves as &#x27;fogless&#x27; mirrors.  They aren&#x27;t.  This gem of a product, though, does exactly as advertised and we love it big time.  Complete and utter endorsement.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror for my husband for Christmas 2011.  It is probably the 3rd one he&#x27;s tried.  It is AWESOME and works exactly as it is supposed to.  After about 5 months of use, it developed a problem where the mirror pivots.  It wouldn&#x27;t stay in an upright position while it was filled wiht water.  After a couple of months passed, I decided to contact the seller to see if this was a known issue.  They immediatetly contacted me back (on a SATURDAY no less) and stated they would mail us a replacement part at no charge.  These days, that kind of customer service can be hard to come by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product works exactly as described and it WORKS!  And the seller is AWESOME.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are in the market for a fogless shower mirror, this is the best!</li>
    <li> So far(two weeks)this mirror has remained crystal clear without needing to put water into the rear reservoir. I only have to splash water on the mirror and it clears and remains clear.  I am very pleased.  It, also, seems to be much more secure to the wall than my previous mirrors.</li>
    <li> My initial review for this item was ONE star because after following the directions and mounting this to my shower tile it fell right to the floor after I attached the mirror (with water.). However, after posting this review I was contacted by the company and asked to give them a second chance. They sent me a replacement mirror and this time it worked out very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note. Don&#x27;t skimp on cleaning the surface where this will be mounted. Give it a very good thorough cleaning and then wipe it down with alcohol as a final step. Make sure you use all the gel the package comes with and apply it ALL OVER THE BACK OF THE PRODUCT. Believe me, if you don&#x27;t mount this properly and put a little time into it you will be so aggravates you will just want to trash it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moving on to performance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a good weeks use the actual mirror seems to be holding up well. No nasty uncleanable spots like I experienced on other shower mirrors. The instructions advise that you simply clean the mirror with the included squeegee. I would stick to these instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot speak on the longevity of this item yet but so far so good. From previous experiences with similar items I found that once the mirror gets dirty and grimy it can&#x27;t be cleaned no matter the means...hopefully the same won&#x27;t apply to this product. Time will tell!</li>
    <li> Mirror is awesome and works however the silicone glue they sent me was as hard as a rock and I had to buy my own glue. Now it&#x27;s up and great but I spent and extra $10 to make it stick.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this mirror for over a year now and like it better all the time. It is truly fogless and if you shave in the shower, this is the mirror for you. Previous attempts at hanging mirrors in my shower were disappointments, either they weren&#x27;t fogless as advertised or they used suction cups to attach to the wall. Suction cups didn&#x27;t and their fogless wasn&#x27;t. This Toilet Tree fogless shower mirror was a good investment, it really is fogless and it stays in place, no problems in 14 months of daily use!  Update- after over 4 years of use, this still a great product, I use it daily. To those who complain of distortion, it is plastic after all! If the mirror was destined to be an element in the Hubble telescope or if you shave from across the room, distortion would be a dal breaker, but at 12 inches or so, distortion is NOT an issue. A couple of problems have arisen and others have mentioned that the adjustment mechanism failed, mine did also, but since I&#x27;m the only user, I super glued the angle I wanted. The only problem I&#x27;ve encountered that will require replacement is the silvering has disappeared from the bottom 1 inch of the mirror and about 1/2 inch on the right side. This is a great product that works as advertised. After over 4 years, it still gets 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Works just as promised. Large mirror that stays fog free for a great shave. Easy to install and use. Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I think the reviews for this speak volumes, but it is a pretty cool shower mirror.  I wish it had a hook thing for the razor to hang from instead of a shelf.  Other than that, great shower mirror.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband for Christmas - he was very excited to get it hung up and be able to use it.  Unfortunately it fell off within 24 hours.  Still looking for somehow to hang it that is a bit more sturdy.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because it is a good name brand ang although I have not put it up yet I am confident it is what you say it is</li>
    <li> I got this last week and followed the instructions and it works exactly as it was advertised.  Having the mirror in the shower has been great help.  After a week or so it hasn&#x27;t fogged up once when you fill it. The mirror is light and easy to get on and off the hook.  Attaching it to the wall was simple and took about 5 minutes.  This is one of those - it does exactly what it says it does products.  I love it.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best shower mirror ever. It is so simple to use and works exactly as described.&lt;br /&gt;Will NOT fog up at all as the warm water from your shower will prevent this.&lt;br /&gt;The only regret we have : that we did not buy this mirror years ago.&lt;br /&gt;Do not hesitate, it is the best!!!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a fog less mirror to shave in the shower. And this mirror pried to be the best one. It&#x27;s very easy to assemble and very simple to use. I enjoy my shave while shower is on and it&#x27;s light helps for better view. The defogging is very easy and I have tried in really heavy fog by turning shower to max hit and keeping bath room door close it works very well. I would say its great product and to me it&#x27;s worth having. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have searched long and hard for a good shower mirror.  This product fully meets my needs and expectations.  The directions were easy to follow and worked as described. The mirror works as described and I am very happy.  No problems.</li>
    <li> My husband was a tad skeptical at first having tried other shower mirrors that promised to be fogless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We found this mirror to be durable, shatter proof and rust proof so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it damaging your  tiles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an added bonus the ToiletTree fogless shower mirror also has a convenient shelf on the base, and the mirror comes with a  little squeegeeto get rid of any water droplets that get onto the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The entire outside of the mirror is also illuminated by LED lights, which is a nice feature to have in a mirror, giving you plenty of room while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We found the mirror convenient to have, as  my husband is able to shave in the shower, while I use the big mirror in our bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all we found that the Fogless shower mirror does what it was designed to do. It doesn&#x27;t fog, provided the water doesn&#x27;t cool down.  If this happens and the mirror does fog up, just take it off the  bracket and refill it with hot water.</li>
    <li> I gave this product to my son for Christmas - he insisted on this brand as it&#x27;s the only truly Fogless shaving mirror for use in the shower.  He is very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Awesome!! Wish this would have been the first one we bought!!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my son. The loves it!  We have perchased other &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; mirrors before but this one really works! It was also delivered quickly and in perfect condition</li>
    <li> This was my 2nd mirror purchased from this fine vendor.  They are both perfect in my opinion.  Exactly as offered.  Wonderful in shower.  Makes shaving at the sink feel like a return to the dark ages. The squeegee is important because if you use it and do not clean with caustic stuff it will stay like new for who knows how many years.  BTW:  The 2nd one purchased was for a second home.  I have one LED and one not.  Toss up on which is better.  If you have good light then not needed.  If in a dark shower then it would be nice to have.  Love this product as much as anything I have ever owned.  Simple, well designed and is EXACTLY what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I have used this mirror for almost a year now. I purchased it after failed use of \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; mirrors bought at big chain stores that fogged the very minute the water got remotely hot. I read all of the reviews and decided to give it a chance. The mirror does have some flaws, but I feel that it is the best option available and works well. In fact, I just moved and didn&#x27;t want to pull the mirror down and try to readhesive it to my new shower wall, so I just purchased a new one. I read some reviews again after purchasing it and thougth I should leave one of my own should someone want to read and add to their decision making.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I read some complaints about the adhesive. I like the adhesive option better than suction cups. Though more permanent, I have never had much luck with suction cups in the shower. We had a sprayer held on by suction cups in our old shower and it would fall down every two weeks or so. I also don&#x27;t want a more permanent option like screws! I never had a problem with the adhesive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, you do have to fill the mirror with water each time you want to use it. I don&#x27;t think this is a problem and if fact realize that it is the source of the mirror working so well. All I do is run the shower for a minute and then fill the mirror with the water. It works well every time and I can shave right in the shower; something I have grown to love. I now hate shaving out of the shower and can&#x27;t wait for my new mirror to arrive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest flaw is in fact the hinge. It does fail over time. Luckily for me the spot the mirror would stay at was at a good enough height for me that it did not cause me to tear the mirror off the wall and throw it. I definitely do not see this as a deal breaker because when I have it at the installed height I want it I don&#x27;t plan on tilting the mirror at all. SO, if/when it fails again I will simply add a screw in the hinge or jerryrig it with something to bypass the hinge and thus keeping the mirror aimed at the right angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, the price is maybe a few dollars high for the product. I like the plastic construction. I had no problems with the adhesive. The hinge is flawed, but I feel easily fixable and worth dealing with. This is by far, in my opinion, the best option for a fogless mirror in the shower. Thank you for reading!</li>
    <li> Wonderful! I love being able to easily shave in the shower now.</li>
    <li> This is the only fogless shower mirror that I have ever used that is really and truly FOGLESS.  I have struggled with work-around for years--wish I had come across this product a long time ago.  Don&#x27;t give it another thought:  BUY IT!</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Easy to install. The included squeegee wiper blade quickly gets rid of shower splashes.The tilting mechanism was difficult to adjust and I was afraid I&#x27;d break it at first. I called the company telephone number (prominately displayed in the instructions) and they answered on the first ring, assurred me it wouldn&#x27;t break, and they were correct. The only problem I have now is forgetting to emply the hot water reservoir after showering, but I&#x27;ll get better with practice.</li>
    <li> Love it the first fog less mirror that actually works! I would recommend this one to anyone that shaves in the shower for sure.</li>
    <li> So let me get this out of the way - the mirror did fall off my shower wall.  I just cleaned my shower wall again and went to my local Home Depot and picked up more clear Silicone II (made for bathrooms) and just put it back up.  So that out of the way, this is the best fogless mirror i&#x27;ve used so far.   The thing works as advertised unlike many other &amp;#34;fogless mirrors&amp;#34; i&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
    <li> So far, I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.  I had the Ace fogless mirror for several years prior to purchasing this mirror and always liked the simplistic yet EFFECTIVE way that it stayed fogless from using warm shower water.  The Toiletree mirror does this just as well, BUT it is wider which makes it easier to see your whole face, plus it has the little squeegee which may seem gimmicky when reading about it, but it actually works well.  It especially is useful for those with hard water that can leave water spots as you&#x27;ll keep the mirror surface cleaner/unspotted much easier.  I tend to squeegee it right before I shave of course, but then also before I get out of the shower after the water is off.  This should help preserve the mirror&#x27;s surface longer which was the main problem with the Ace mirror I used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to drop the review down by 1 star only because the price is kind of a hit, but I think it may last a long time, so perhaps the price is worth it.  After roughly 30+ days, it is.  This also holds true given the wall attachment method (silicone adhesive which is easy to use and removeable) versus other mirrors that use suction cups which get brittle and don&#x27;t hold over time (which also happened with the Ace mirror).</li>
    <li> I use it all the time! I don&#x27;t shave without i! Thats how good this fogless mirror is! Great product</li>
    <li> Bought this one to replace my first, now a few years old. The older one was a bit clunkier, heavier &amp; the nubs that held the mirror in place had worn down, so the mirror tilted down when full of water. The updated design/manufacture is vastly improved; the mirror is lighter weight overall &amp; the plastic sturdier; the mirror virtual locks at your chosen tilt angle. I liked the first one enough, despite not exactly ideal design, to reorder. This updated design is even better/higher quality - I&#x27;m a big fan.</li>
    <li> This is a good mirror, does not fog, and appears well made. My only complaint: I wish it magnified the reflection. This would create 2 benefits: 1. I could stand a little farther back from it, and 2. Since I use it for shaving, I could seemore easily if I missed any spots.</li>
    <li> I bought as gift so I really cannot review the product properly. Packaged well, looks great.</li>
    <li> The mirror does work although you do have to always fill the back reservoir with water everytime.  The directions that come with it say to use the entire tube of the glue to make it stick properly to your shower.  I couldn&#x27;t use it all because it all wouldn&#x27;t come out so I ended up using about 1/2 the tube.  This was after pressing on the tube as hard as I could.  Thus after about a month in my shower, this mirror fell and busted apart.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Easy to use!</li>
    <li> Have had for two years, almost to the date.  Worked perfectly, but now the mirror glaze is washing away.  The bottom 1/4 is peeled off.  I will actually buy another because it has worked well just wish it didn&#x27;t have such a short life.    Update 12-15-14  I saw that this product had a lifetime warranty.  Emailed company and they had a new mirror to me within the week.  Great customer service and new mirror is perfect.</li>
    <li> Such a simple design, but works great. No fog here! I love the adjustable mirror, both myself and my wife can use the mirror.  Solid construction.  Very little distortion in the mirror images...some of those cheaper mirrors will make your face look like you are on a carnival ride. This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Good price compared to other products like ot</li>
    <li> this is it... if you&#x27;re looking hard enough to read the reviews than you found the mirror you&#x27;ve been looking for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you are as persnickety as the rest of us who bought this product and are downright ecstatic at how awesome it is, this mirror is the last one you&#x27;ll buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t fall.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t fog up.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t leave any spots (if you use the perfectly sized squeegee).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing this mirror doesn&#x27;t do is shave for you!  well made and well done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one \\&quot;suggestion\\&quot; i would have for the company is to make one with a digital clock, because you can quickly lose track of time and a clock would help to keep me on schedule.</li>
    <li> This is my second mirror and I was lenient about buying another one for fear it wouldn&#x27;t work but this baby works like a charm you do have to fill it up with hot water every time but that&#x27;s no biggie as long as it works.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first but this mirror does what it says it does fog free, squeegee is kinda worthless doesn&#x27;t wipe mirror uniformally but a towel works just as well,</li>
    <li> Great product. Works as advertised and has proven longer lasting than other brands.</li>
    <li> baught this item for my husband for christmas and the packaging was perfect and the item was new so the seller is up to par, but the product itself is definitely NOT fogless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical to begin with but i should have known better as I have yet to find a truly fogless shower mirror.</li>
    <li> I just bought and received my second one of these great fogless mirrors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a 30yo guy who has been dedicated to shower shaving since high school, so needless to say I have been through some &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; mirrors! This one has been hands down my favorite, which is why I bought another one. The product works as intended, and I had my first one for over 2 years with no issues regarding the clarity or it fogging up while in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I am not giving a full 5 stars is because the hinge system that pivots the mirror up and down wore down to the point where it was pointless to adjust the mirror since it could not tolerate the weight of the water in the chamber and just immediately fall to the lowest position. I should note this happened well over a year after using. Also, when removing the old one to replace it, the adhesive took some effort to remove, and could potentially leave lasting marks and be a big headache for renters. Though I did see that this company also has a suction cup version of this which could be better for those who move around a lot/rent.</li>
    <li> works great and mirror is big enough to see myself when shaving. it went up easily. couldn&#x27;t ask for anymore than that.</li>
    <li> Worked well for the first 4-5 months until the silicone and the sticky pads gave way which woke the wife, the baby, and even the dog left because it scared him.  Also, the residue left on the mirror became harder and harder to remove for a clean viewing surface.</li>
    <li> Some distortion in the reflection, but it works fine. Install is simple and we&#x27;ll see how long it holds up.</li>
    <li> A lot bigger than expected! Not really, I read a lot of helpful reviews. I didn&#x27;t really know how much I was going to use the squeegie, but it turns out to be really helpful. Simply slide it out, wipe, put it back in. Very quick and easy process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to this great fogless mirror is that it doesn&#x27;t have a water release that I experienced with others. You can have cold water hit your feet every time from last use...orrrrr just drill an extra small hole at the bottom. This will slowly release all of the water by your next shower. Totally getting rid of a step all together.</li>
    <li> I bought this after trying to find a real fog free mirror.  It works great as long as you fill it up with hot water every time&lt;br /&gt;you get in the shower.  The only problem is that the plastic mirror warps after about a month.  If you don&#x27;t mind your face&lt;br /&gt;being distored, it will provide fog free results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the the mirror for a couple of weeks now.  Filling it up each time is no problem and it slides back on easily.  I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> I ordered this fog less mirror a couple of years ago then I moved into a bigger apt. I love, love love this mirror...It&#x27;s great to not have to get out the shower to detangle my wet thick hair in the bathroom mirror...easy to put up and stays up till you have to take done. Only wish the mirror was longer to show more, but the mirror does have tilt options on it, to tilt up or down. best fog less mirror ever!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several different fogless shower mirrors (all bought from Bed Bath &amp; Beyond).  Most of these work only for a short period of time and then fog up no matter what I try to do.  Bought this fogless shower mirror based on others&#x27; reviews.  It works very nicely and I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> I love to shave in the shower. I was always fighting with mirrors that were fogging up, falling off, or just getting worse as time goes by. I wasn&#x27;t sure about the silicon attachment but it really holds this thing in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once installed I felt like I had new eyes. I could really see my face with this mirror. I can&#x27;t believe how much more clear this mirror is. Compared to a dirty old mirror that foggy or soapy this thing it awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure I like the idea of the squeegee but it is fine and works good. My only criticism of the mirror is that when it&#x27;s filled with water it is easy to knock it into one of the adjustable positions. I wish the adjustment was tighter or could be locked into place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you shave in the shower you should get this mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--VRMan</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been delighted with this mirror and have had four before it we&#x27;ve been disappointed in. It really does what it says.</li>
    <li> Very Easy to install. Works well. No problems with filling. I use the hand held shower head to fill and do not remove the mirror. Wish I had found this mirror years ago!</li>
    <li> Those who gave this 3 stars or less are too stupid to shave. It works. Very well. Get it. Now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been through numerous shaving mirrors in the past and so far this one is the best.  Just follow all the directions provided and you&#x27;ll be on your way to clear-mirror shaving.</li>
    <li> After the shave...I have to dump out the water from the back...but then I must return the mirror&lt;br /&gt;to the holder.  Would love to figure out how to drain the mirror without putting it on the shower floor.</li>
    <li> Before getting this mirror, I had one that hooked &amp;#34;inline&amp;#34; off of the shower head. It never worked that well and &amp;#34;dripped&amp;#34; all of the time. This is very simple... just fill it up, shave, dump it out. It sticks to the wall with provided glue and I haven&#x27;t had any issue with it. The only complaint I have is that it distorts the image a little (believe it is not perfectly flat).  UPDATE - Customer service is UNBELIEVABLE. After having this mirror for about a year and a half, the glue holding it to the shower wall finally gave out. I contacted the company asking how I could get some additional adhesive and they promptly sent me a new attachment base for FREE! The new base included attachment tape (rather than glue that came with the original) so it could be adhered to the shower wall. Hopefully the tape will adhere longer than the glue... regardless, I couldn&#x27;t believe they sent me out a new base with tape for free. This company clearly stands behind their product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m replacing a old fog free mirror that was attached to a shower bar kit I bought a while ago...&lt;br /&gt;For some reason this mirror makes my face look far away :-(  have get real close to see where where you&#x27;re shaving! especially sideburns!&lt;br /&gt;So. i give this a meh!!</li>
    <li> Worked great at first but after a few months it fogs on the edges. Don&#x27;t know if some type of chical or film is wearing off</li>
    <li> I bought for my husband so he would start shaving in the shower. He was always complaining about red bumps and I told him the shower would help open up the pores! I works. It stays. Just have to fill it up with hot water before using and remember to dump it out so it doesn&#x27;t start mildewing.</li>
    <li> I have a shaved head and have to shave every day while in the shower, and this new fogless mirror is absolutely the best mirror I have ever purchased. Yes, you do have to fill it with hot water each time you&#x27;re going to use it, but that&#x27;s a small price to pay to be able to shave continuously without having to clear the mirror every few seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it so much, I&#x27;m buying 2 more. 1 for my son and another 1 for me to travel with.</li>
    <li> Great price on this mirror--saw similar one at The Art of Shaving for A LOT more.  Works great, doesn&#x27;t fog up.  Easy to use.</li>
    <li> Unlike the inline shower mirrors this one requires you to fill the reservoir and then squeegy the excess water after replacing it on the caddy that hangs on your bathroom shower wall with silicone.  After that the mirror is clear and very helpful for shaving.  however after 10 months of use, it fell off the wall, razor, and all, onto the shower floor.  the mirror material did not crack but now the entire contraption is useless as their website does not have the extra supplies offered to reattach to the wall so I&#x27;m stuck finding a new one.  I also now need to learn how to remove the excess silicone on the wall.</li>
    <li> I have had this for about a year now. It is so nice being able to shave in the shower and actually see what I am doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was easy to install. At firs I was worried about the quality of it, but so far it has just worked perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just dump out the old water and fill it with the water at the beginning of my shower and it stays fog-less for the whole shower. No complaints here.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror and had to order a new one when I moved. I didn&#x27;t know I could just order the silicone for the new house. Either way a great product and worth buying it twice!!!</li>
    <li> bought one of these mirrors for my new wet room and it is brilliant.doeas exactly what it said it would.im very pleased thank you</li>
    <li> This mirror is far and away the best designed of the many I&#x27;ve used over decades of shaving in the shower. The water reservoir system works much better than mirrors utilizing only a no-fog coating, the squeegee is quite useful and tucks away into the housing, and the built-in shelf is actually big enough for my large razor. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> The mirror was very easy to install and definitely stays put.  So far, it remains fog-free.  My husband uses it the most, so if he has any comments, I will update my post.  I&#x27;d like to know how to clean it since it says not to use Windex -- any comments??</li>
    <li> This is so awesome, this is my second one. One in each shower! I got booted to the other bathroom. Shaving over the sink with a steamy mirror sucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just keep the water reservoir filled with water. After jumping in the shower, while soaping up my body, I&#x27;ll fill my mouth with warm/hot water and spit a stream onto the mirror. It doesn&#x27;t take many mouthfuls to heat up the mirror. If by chance I didn&#x27;t warm up the mirror enough, I just spit a little more water whilst shaving.</li>
    <li> It works...enough said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a minor annoyance to have to fill it, but we have no problem getting it up and down swiftly. You just let the shower do the filling in about 7 seconds and get on with it. I find it inoffensive looking - some people ask if we have a tv in the shower...ha! The little squeegee is important and works fine.</li>
    <li> Quality isn&#x27;t the best</li>
    <li> Does the trick, but it gets cloudy if you have any kind of hard water. Squeegy ends up not doing a great job. Still shaving with this mirror though.</li>
    <li> Best thing since sliced bread.Can&#x27;t believe I look forward to shaving after years of dealing with foggy mirrors(about 5/yr) Give yourself a treat. Jay Breslin</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror for the shower. Doesn&#x27;t fog, easy to install, and you get a perfectly clear mirror for shaving. No complaints.</li>
    <li> It really works. Set up took 24 hours but it is totally worth every penny.</li>
    <li> thank you to ToiletTree products for the fantastic fog less shower mirror. the mirror when filled with hot or warm water will be fog less while you shower. it&#x27;s perfect for tweezing , exfoliating and so much more. coming with a stand with adhesive silicon you can hang it on your shower wall and have a hands free mirror. the mirror once on the holder can be titled up and down and never fall. if falling does occur it will never break because of the acrylic glass. the only time you may experience some fogginess is if you don&#x27;t have water filled to the top. it is an awesome product , making washing your face in the shower so easy</li>
    <li> Finally, a fogless shower mirror that is actually fogless. Works great after 1.5 years. So impressed,  I bought one for my brother and one for my Dad as a gift.</li>
    <li> Nice but all shower mirrors seem to be made with a plastic mirror.  Over time they easily scratch.  Can&#x27;t find one with real glass mirror.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend gave me one as a gift and I loved it so much I ordered another.&lt;br /&gt;Quick and easy to install. It isn&#x27;t one of those stupid magnification mirrors that distorts.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s minor conveniences like this mirror that really improve everyday life.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s coming up on three and a half years since I purchased this. I installed it in the shower within a day or two of getting it. I&#x27;ve used it literally every single day since. Compared to all the other &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; mirrors I&#x27;ve gone through, and it is several, this  1) Has never fallen off the shower wall in the middle of the night, making my wife and I wonder &amp;#34;what the heck was that?&amp;#34; 2) Has never fogged up. 3) Has not had to be replaced, due to one or both of 1) and 2).  This meets the requirements for a fogless mirror.  Very early on, when I first started using it, the image was very distorted, almost to the point that it could take on any funhouse mirror in a deathmatch. However, after a week or two of red-hot water fills from the shower, it seemed to stabilize, and it has had an entirely normal mirror view ever since.  When I purchased it, the cost was twenty-nine, ninety-five. Today, the price is twenty-nine, ninety-five. I definitely had spent more than this on the first five or six &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; mirrors that eventually failed. I wish I had discovered this back then. It is worth every single cent.  Update June 2017: six and a half years now. One problem did crop up a year or two ago - the little &#x27;ratchet&#x27; that holds it at whatever angle you set it at had apparently worn down, so when it was full of water, it would not stay in position, instead just tipping until it was all the way down. I emailed the company. They were aware of the problem, and sent a new ratchet mechanism, which you just pressed in place where the old one was.  Perfect. No charge for the replacement part. And yeah, it&#x27;s still stuck on the wall, has never come down in six and a half years.  If you shave in the shower, and you don&#x27;t buy this product.....you&#x27;re a chump! None of the other mirrors comes close to the quality of this.</li>
    <li> I got two mirrors for Father&#x27;s Day gifts. Quality was nice, price was good and it was easy to install in the shower.  My husband has not used it as of yet but I am sure he wiil enjoy it.  I liked that it had a squeegee and a ledge for your razor.  Thanks for a nice product!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really the little things in life that make it so good, and to be able to shave in the shower, fantastic!!!!! Also you can see yourself closer with the magnification!! Awesome sauce!!!!! Simply love this, so easy to use, came on time and at a very good price!!! Thank you so much!!!!</li>
    <li> Works exactly as advertised.  A nice addition to my shower.  My only wish was that it had a way to drain the water out without taking it off (I use the sprayer from the shower to fill it).</li>
    <li> This mirror is just okay. It&#x27;s kind of a pain to fill with water. I tried putting RainX on it and that worked for a few showers. Kind of bulky for our little shower.</li>
    <li> Not even close to fogless. A waste of money and time ordering it. Do not buy this product , it SUCKS</li>
    <li> I have had several shower mirrors that didn&#x27;t last and did not stay fog free. This mirror is almost like magic once you add the shower water to it. I couldn&#x27;t believe how clear it stays and the squeegee is an awesome addition to keep drops of water away.</li>
    <li> I got this for my bf! He loves it! It really does work and stays up too! Just great! It&#x27;s the one you&#x27;ve been looking for!!</li>
    <li> I was tired of my old mirror that always fogged up when showering although it was advertised as fogless!  I bought the ToiletTree product since I liked the way it was designed to ensure it indeed was fogless.  Also, the price was right.  It works perfectly in my steamy shower!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I first saw the product and read the reviews. I decided to give the product a try as previous ones didn&#x27;t live up to the promises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has exceeded my expectations. The way it was designed and the use of the warm water is the secret. Don&#x27;t hesitate if you&#x27;re considering a fogless shower mirror. It&#x27;s by far the best product on the market.</li>
    <li> I have had quite a few mirrors for the shower over the years and this one is by far the best.  I have been using it for about 6 weeks now and have not had one issue.  I am also confident that if I did ToiletTree would stand behind it.  No fog, Never!</li>
    <li> UPDATE:  After six weeks, the unit came crashing down in my shower.  It turns out I did NOT use the entire tube of silicone adhesive.  But, the old silicone adhesive was very easy to pull off with a little work with my fingers.  That&#x27;s a relief!  I am going to the store to buy a large tube of silicone to correct this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll see that this Fog-less Shower Mirror is very popular and with good reason. I shopped for a long time and purchased some very poor shaving mirrors. The one I ended up using was a ten dollar department store suction cup circled mirror. It constantly fogged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason this mirror stays fogless is that it simply uses your hot shower water to balance the temperature from behind the mirror to the front of the mirror. As long as you fill up the relatively small reservoir behind the detachable mirror before you shower, it will remain fogless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Assembly had me a bit worried as it truly is permanent. There are no suction cups, but rather two one-inch adhesive squares to initially hold the mirror reservoir/shelf. Then you apply three toothpaste sized strips of silicone adhesive to the back and place it on the wall. It does not matter if your shower wall is tile, slate or fiberglass. It is recommended that you thoroughly clean the surface first and then wipe with rubbing alcohol and wait 24 hours for a solid seal. I suspect if I ever need to pull this off the tiles, it will take some razor blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The frame is adjustable which is very very handy, but the frame pivot is plastic and very stiff. I am always very careful when trying to adjust the mirror, as it seems like it could break. So far, it&#x27;s good. The shelf at the bottom of the mirror is very handy for holding razors, but not much else. It would have been nice to have lip of some kind on the shelf so the razor won&#x27;t fall off. Moving around in a shower spray, I have had it slip off. The provided squeegee is nice to use actually, as a hand towel or sponge will not take the spottiness of water drops off as well as the single swipe of this squeegee. The squeegee slides nicely into the tray for storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price for this mirror system is reasonable considering all the products out there that don&#x27;t work. Read the rest of these reviews and I think you&#x27;ll find it truly is a better shower/shaving mirror than any of the others offered here at Amazon or elsewhere.e will not take the spottiness of water drops off as well as the single swipe of this squeegee.

    <li> I bought this mirror for my husband this past Christmas.  He likes to shave in the shower and he gets frustrated because the mirror always fogs up.  He started using this mirror a week ago and loves it!  He can shave in the shower and not have to worry about it fogging up.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely fantastic!  I received it as a gift for Christmas and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  The installation and mounting is super simple, and when directions are followed, it really doesn&#x27;t fog at all.  having this mirror in the shower allows me to shave in the shower, which saves a good 5 minutes every morning.  I find myself trying to remember what to do when I get out of the shower, now that shaving is done in process!!  Excellent product and highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Have tried other shower mirror in the past with fog free spray solutions that did not work.  Science behind this product is simple and effective!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had other shower mirrors that claimed to be fog less or it required a special spray in order to work, but this mirror is AWESOME! Easy to install and even easier to use, and having the shelf for my razor is a great plus. 5 Stars!</li>
    <li> This mirror replaced a previous mirror by ACE. It also had a water reservoir, but used suction cups to attach to the wall. This worked fine in the beginning, but near the end it was sliding down the wall and falling off if I didn&#x27;t clean or squeegee the wall really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mirror by TT is way better. It&#x27;s bigger, adheres permanently, has it&#x27;s own squeegee (h&#x27;ray), and also uses the superior water reservoir. I have seen &amp;#34;fogless coating&amp;#34; mirrors and I think that although I have not used one, I wonder how that would work for more than a little while. Science tells me fog it generated in high humidity when a cold object has hot water in front of it. Putting water behind the mirror eliminates that issue and it&#x27;s perfectly fog free every time. I had issues with my old mirror, but I used it fog free for 10 years, and look forward to using this one for at least 10 more.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. My husband has tried other fogless shower mirrors and this is the only one that is truly fogless...we love it!!!</li>
    <li> Works like no other shower mirror I used.&lt;br /&gt;Just add hot water and instantly clear mirror.&lt;br /&gt;FOGLESS FOGLESS FOGLESS FOGLESS</li>
    <li> After about 1 years the hing has become too lose and the glass fogs. For the time span it worked it was great.</li>
    <li> fog free, cant shave without it now</li>
    <li> Works exactly the way it was advertised.  It uses the principal of the shower water temperature the same as in the mirror resevoir.</li>
    <li> Purchased in October 2011, all the accolades that have been written, I agree with.  But, I am buying another one because for some reason the mirror would not stay up.  Either the adjustment cogs wore out on the mounted bracket or the the piece that the mirror slips into.  Drilled a hole and put screws in and they worked, two problems no longer could adjust, and putting the holder for the mirror in and out broke one of the side tabs so mirror is at a slight angle.  I do like it a lot and for over a year it is worth it to me to buy another.</li>
    <li> I have had several shaving mirrors in the past. None of them worked well. This one works great. NO FOGGING at all. Nice clear and big. Nice thing is that it stays adhered to the shower wall.</li>
    <li> We have been looking for a truly fog free mirror for my husband for nearly 20 years and have finally found one in this mirror! The design concept is ingenious. I would give it 5 stars except that it could use a little tweak with the shelf that holds the razor. There is no lip or railing around the shelf to keep the razor on the shelf if you accidentally bump it. However, that is a minor issue, and we are generally thrilled with this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for his birthday. He uses it in the shower every morning and has not had any complaints. It doesn&#x27;t fog, cleans up well, seems durable and sturdy once affixed to the shower wall, and is easy to maintain. He likes that it&#x27;s out of the way, but functional.&lt;br /&gt;All pros.&lt;br /&gt;No cons.</li>
    <li> Along with the shower radio, got this for husband a couple years ago.  He shaves his head every other day, and this has definitely come in handy for him!</li>
    <li> I got the product and didnt read the instructions and was let down but the company reached out to make sure it was a good purchase. I told them the product did indeed fog up but they explained what to do. Fill the back up with hot water and I did and it totally does not fog. So very happy with my purchase and their great customer service</li>
    <li> As other reviewers have said this really works.  Easy to put up in the shower and easy to fill and empty the reservoir.  Perfect product which my husband loves.  The squeegee is a nice touch.  Buy it.</li>
    <li> This works as advertised !! - am definitely happy with the product so far.. and dont anticipate any concerns down the line... fill it with hot water and make sure to empty the water after use to avoid straining the attach to the shower wall. I do like the included squegee to keep the surface clean..... not giving it 5 stars only because they could improve the flat surface with a couple of well placed holes to serve as a shaver holder (for e.g.)...but that is not really part of the advertised purpose..so 4 stars is well deserved..</li>
    <li> this mirror is everything it says it is. The mirror does not fog, instalation is easy and thhe mirror is provides a clear image! If you are looking for a  shower mirror that actually does what  it claims it does, this is the product to choose.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my fiance for Christmas and he loves it!  Says it&#x27;s the best shaving mirror he has owned.  No problems with fogging and he liked that it came with a squeegee (sp?) too.</li>
    <li> I shave in the shower every morning (ok, fine, MOST mornings), thus I need a solid, fogless mirror to ensure I haven&#x27;t missed any spots. This product does a perfect job of keeping the mirror from fogging. The included adhesive strips ensure that the mirror won&#x27;t fall down and they too work perfectly. The only drawback is that once placed, you can&#x27;t really move it. I recently moved into a new home and wanted to take my mirror with me, but I lacked the adhesive strips for a new location. I emailed the company and received a response within the same day, telling me that new strips would be mailed at no cost. I value customer service greatly, and it factors into my buying decisions every single day. To know that this company cares about its customers means that I will definitely recommend them to my friends/family, and I will certain purchase from them again if need be.</li>
    <li> It does fog...hard to see when showering with hot water. I would not recommend it.  Mu husband did not like it.</li>
    <li> I have had many shaving mirrors in the shower. They were foggy and I couldn&#x27;t see where to shave or they fell down from the wall. This mirror sits where I put it and the mirror is unperturbed by being in a shower. I made a good buy and the shaving result is just fine and smooth.</li>
    <li> It is everything I want from a shower mirror. It is still working great after 6 months. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Bottom line- it works, and it&#x27;s the only &#x27;fogless&#x27; shower mirror that&#x27;s actually, you know, fogless. I love it, and am recommending it to everyone I know.</li>
    <li> My husband is so happy with his mirror.  I did a bit of research and this one had the best reviews.  Its a great product.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my husband. He loves that it does not fog. Easy to hang/mount. Good mirror and works well.</li>
    <li> This product is neat. Fill with hot water and the mirror never fogs. Installation is easy and so far it seems to be holding well with the silicone adhesive. The little squeegie is also a plus and clears the mirror from water or fog (if you didn&#x27;t fill reservoir before the mirror got foggy). The tray may be useful for something but it would be more useful if it were perforated to allow the water to drain from the shelf. Look for the lowest price before purchasing and you will not be sorry for the purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy shower shaving!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a few different shower mirrors from various vendors throughout the years, none have impressed me as much as this one.  The fogless capability is awesome, the squeegee is a great addition, and the tilting mirror is exactly what the doctor ordered.  If you have any question about whether this product is going to be the &amp;#34;best option&amp;#34; for you, I&#x27;d love to say &amp;#34;definitely, yes!&amp;#34;, but I don&#x27;t know your needs.  I *can* tell you that this mirror is perfect for my needs, good craftsmanship, and I&#x27;ve had ZERO issues so far...so I think you&#x27;d be doing yourself a disservice if you don&#x27;t at least consider/try this mirror.</li>
    <li> Writing this several months after buying/hanging up. I didn&#x27;t use all the silicone in the tube, but it&#x27;s hanging fine and doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;ll fall any time soon. Absolutely no complaints about how well it works. Fill the back with water, wipe it with the squeegee, and it stays completely fogless throughout even long showers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I&#x27;d hesitate on when buying this is that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;semi permanent&amp;#34;. I&#x27;m sure removing it wouldn&#x27;t be that bad, but you do stick it to the shower wall with silicon adhesive. This may be a deal breaker for some apartment dwellers.</li>
    <li> I have tried four different fogless shower mirrors and none were truly fogless in fact quite the opposite, but this one has worked to perfection used as directed and it performs as claimed.</li>
    <li> It worked exactly as advertised.  Although I thought filling a resevoir behind the mirror with hot water was going to be a little cumbersome, the confirguration of the product made it easy.  Installing it was quite easy and the instructions were clear.</li>
    <li> Easy to install and works great. I fill it with water and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;I plan on getting more as gifts for xmas.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> I like this shower mirror. I upgraded from a cheap round suction cup mirror and the larger square mirror is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror is well designed and built well. The mirror is large enough to see your entire face and the mounting system is solid. Having a water reservoir built into the back of the mirror is a great idea. It really helps keep it fog free. It is semi-permanently mounted, so it may not be for all users. You could move it, but you would have to clean up the tape and silicone adhesive and find replacement mounting material at a hardware store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reasons I rated it four stars: The distortion of the plastic mirror surface can be a little annoying. The cost is high for all plastic. Yes, the plastic reflective surface makes it lighter, but at this price I would have preferred a more durable material...like real glass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I like it and it works very well.</li>
    <li> This shower mirror is fantastic and Kelly Parisi, the director of marketing, handled a request I had just perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product/ company to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have tried a number of &amp;#34;fog free&amp;#34; mirrors and all have been less than satisfactory after a year or so of use. This one is different and I can see that it is very unlikely to give me problems down the road. The elegant simplicity of this mirror is great. I was able to install it, wait for the mount to set overnight, and use it the next day. No fog!... and the squeegee lets me even clear the droplets that splash up from the shower. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror for my husband and he loves it.  We&#x27;ve had it for a year now and the only issue is the mounting kit recently stopped working.  I emailed ToiletTree and they responded within minutes - a new mounting kit is being shipped out at no cost - EXCELLENT customer service!</li>
    <li> I love this mirror.  Works exactly as indicated.  I&#x27;ve tried several &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; mirrors and none have worked as well as this one.  Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Finding a decent &#x27;fog-less&#x27; shower mirror is pretty hard, but I&#x27;m relatively happy with this product. That said, it has a few drawbacks. First, the whole thing feels very flimsy. When I adjust the angle of the mirror it feels like I&#x27;m going to break it in two. Second, the manual lists a TON of restrictions about cleaning the mirror. All in all though, I&#x27;m pretty happy with this mirror.</li>
    <li> Great product with two flaws that I fixed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I shave wet electric in the shower using Norelco after I lost 10% of my hearing to Panasonic (closer foil shave though).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the flaws and fixes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Worked great when filled with hot water to stop fogging. When you come back next day you have to physically remove the mirror to fill it again. Fix: 1mm hole drilled into bottom but pay attention if you have the mirror tilted upward, you will have to drill near the rear edge, now water slowly drains out so you will find it dry for the next round.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Bottom tray is useless, everything rolls off. I like to keep my shaving cream tube on it. Fix: remove mirror, aplly heat gun at 250F for one minute, bend front edge up, voila, no more rolling off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love everyhting except the logo, toilet(tree) has an insalubrious connotation:)</li>
    <li> Fantastic product!!!  As described!!!  The mirror is large, well-lit, doesn&#x27;t fog, and sticks to wall perfectly.  Highly recommend.  I especially like the squeegee to get rid of any excess water from the mirror.  A++++++</li>
    <li> I like to shave in the shower.  Unlike other products, this one actually let&#x27;s you see clearly by warming up the mirror itself, meaning condensation no longer happens.  As a result, no annoying chemical applications, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I&#x27;ve moved a few times, and they always are kind enough to send me the stuff you need to mount it in your shower for free.</li>
    <li> Product is fine (3.5 stars). The clear part of the squeegee began separating from its black plastic backing until it came off altogether, rendering the squeegee useless. Emailed customer service and haven&#x27;t heard back. That was more than 2 weeks ago. Weak.</li>
    <li> could have been better plastic quality for the price you pay.!!!</li>
    <li> One of the best gifts you can give!!! I&#x27;m coming back to order the larger one...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just not &amp;#34;fog free&amp;#34; Despit filling with hot water,fog and drops accumalete. Treating with Rain X helps a little.</li>
    <li> Really? I sit necessary to shave and put makeup on in the shower? What a waste of water!</li>
    <li> This actually works. Replaced an older mirror with this and so far so good. I didn&#x27;t use the caulk that came with it since I had a tube already open so I used it. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because this mirror would be awesome if it had a way to hold multiple razors instead of just a shelf for 1-2. My GF insists on keeping 2 in the shower so I have to keep mine on a separate hook. But it works great if you fill it up and squeegee it of when you&#x27;re ready to shave!</li>
    <li> Worked great.  Has been installed for over a month and still doing great.  When you add the hot water in the back from the shower, it truly becomes fog free.</li>
    <li> i have only used this for about a week, but it is great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered long enough with my old &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; mirror. This works plain and simple. Worth the money and a time saver every day.</li>
    <li> Well, I read all the reviews and wondered how many of them were real reviews from real people. Some of them seemed like hype. But I ordered the product hoping it would at least be better than what I have used in the past, and it is. Here is my no B.S. review. Fogless? I&#x27;ll rate that 8/10. Only because I have seen it fog once or twice, despite following the directions. If you put the warm water in, like you&#x27;re supposed to, it does remain fogless for about 10 minutes. After that, it will begin to fog up and you have to pour out the water and start again. But yah, it does a good job of remaining fog free for the most part. Squeegee? I&#x27;ll rate that 5/10. It is nice to have a squeegee. I&#x27;ve never seen another mirror that had one. So having one is better than not. But it just doesn&#x27;t work very well. I find I have to use it over and over again to get the drops off of the mirror. And I can&#x27;t just run it straight down, I have to try different angles, etc. to get all the water off. The mirror itself? I&#x27;ll rate that 7/10. Only because the view you get out of the mirror is a little bit distorted. It&#x27;s not too bad. I can still shave just fine and the clarity is great. But it&#x27;s a little distorted and I hate that when you look in the mirror and get a distorted view. The overall function of the mirror? I&#x27;d rate it 8/10. I&#x27;d rate it higher if there wasn&#x27;t so much work involved. I wish they just made a fogless mirror that just sat up there in my shower and required no effort to keep it fogless. Unfortunately, this one requires work. Not that big of a deal. But when you first get in the shower you have to take the mirror off of the wall (which is easy. It just slides off) and then fill up this chamber behind the mirror with warm water from your shower. Then it becomes a little heavy and you have to carefully place it back on the wall without spilling too much water. It is this warm water that sits BEHIND the mirror that is what keeps the mirror from fogging. Then at the end of your shower you have to lift it off and dump the water out. It&#x27;s not too difficult but it&#x27;s definitely more work than any other mirror. It would be nice is they just made a mirror that was fog free without all these steps. The mirror does swivel up and down, which I find very nice. I love that feature. It appears to be very well made. Sturdy. The mounting system was great and had very clear installation instructions. Overall, it lives up to MOST of the hype. But it is a little more work than I thought it would be and the mirror doesn&#x27;t give off a totally accurate view. So if those things were fixed I&#x27;d give it a 10/10. Regardless, I agree that this probably is the best one on the market. It does a great job of staying fog free for at least 10 minutes or more. So that in and of itself is amazing. But the mirror has a lot of other cool features that all the others don&#x27;t have. So until they invent something even better, I&#x27;d have to say that this is probably as good as it gets.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas and paid more than I normally would have. But I read the reviews and thought this would be a good one.  But saldly, it does fog in the shower.  Little disappointed.</li>
    <li> This mirror does exactly what it advertises. Anyone who says different is full of it. Why is it that people have such a hard time following instructions? If you fill it up with hot water prior to EVERY use, it will NEVER fog. Period. Have had it for about three weeks and it is the fogless mirror I&#x27;ve always looked for.</li>
    <li> So far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;I really like the size of the mirror; it&#x27;s much larger than my previous one.&lt;br /&gt;A suggestion: inasmuch as most bath/shower tiles are light in color, consideration should be given to offering a lighter color - even white - for the mounting bracket.&lt;br /&gt;I realize that it&#x27;s the shelf that&#x27;s mostly visible, but a lighter color would be more aesthetically pleasing. All married men understand what I&#x27;m saying.</li>
    <li> This product could be amazing. It works truly amazing. The only thing is that it fell off the wall 1 week after having it up, I don&#x27;t think the support stickers are good.</li>
    <li> I have tried many other products and none of them come close to the Fogless Shower Mirror. It is a mild nuisance to fill the small water tank each time. But, this product really works!!</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror for my husband and he loves it cuz we found one that finally doesn&#x27;t fog or fall off the wall!! Very happy with my purchase... totally worth it!</li>
    <li> The glue that comes with the product arrived hard and unusable.  A call to the company produced a replacement in a day or two.  I&#x27;ve had the product now for many months and it functions beautifully.  It performs as advertised which is all one could want.</li>
    <li> love it problem is it fell off the wall after six months</li>
    <li> Owned many of these over the years, they have all failed within 1-2 months or never did stay fogless.  Paid $29 on Amazon for this, in it&#x27;s simplicity it works perfectly!  just fill the back of the mirror with shower water and dump at end, stays completely fogless.  Also, squeegee is great, scrape down end of each shower and no water spots.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I quite like this mirror, it is indeed the only one of its kind I&#x27;ve used that is ACTUALLY fogless.  However, for a perfect 5-star score, it should have:&lt;br /&gt;* a coating to have water drops slide off&lt;br /&gt;* a drain plug on one of the bottom corners so that you don&#x27;t have to remove it from the wall to drain it.  I have a showerhead on a hose and it would be so nice to just fill it up and pull the plug when done rather than to remove it from its mount, dump it, then finagle it back onto the mount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A 6th star would be earned for having a LED ring around the mirror. (never mind, just saw another version of this with the light!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it does work as advertised.</li>
    <li> This is the best shower mirror available.  Absolutely will not fog, and simple to install and use.  Otaher mirrors do not work or fall off the wall.  Excellent value.</li>
    <li> I ordered a second Fogless Shower Mirror last month when I spent some time in the U.S. The mirror arrived very quickly. I bought my first one a couple years ago on another visit to the U.S. and have used it almost daily ever since. It works beautifully in my shower. My face in the mirror is clear, the warm water keeps the image from clouding over, there is no cable that needs to be attached to the shower mechanism. The first mirror I bought still works fine, but I ordered a second one in case the original ever stops working or gets broken, even though so far it shows no sign of ever breaking down. My one request: start selling it directly in Canada, where I live.</li>
    <li> Finally, a mirror that really works in the shower. Easy to mount. Tilts too. Stays clear when filled with warm water.</li>
    <li> The product is fine, but I would not have purchased it had I known it was made in China. Works as expected.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and he couldn&#x27;t get it to stick in the shower.  It kept falling down.  It was a big disappointment.</li>
    <li> Mirror is comparatively larger than others under $50, which is great for me: larger area for taking in light, I can stand close to mirror and see my whole face, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 2 weeks of use, the mirror is truly fogless and I like it very much. I turn water onto its hottest temperature, fill reservoir, and reduce to milder water temps for my shower. No issues with fogging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the previous 15 years, I&#x27;ve had 4-5 mildly differing solutions. All were smaller with suction-cup backing, and none ever lasted more than 2-years. All but one were more expensive; some had lights, all were of lower quality and/or smaller mirror. I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;ll feel in 2-3 years with ToiletTree product, but from my experiences I&#x27;m currently a fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended improvement (learned when one of my former suction-cup mirrors cracked after falling off the wall when suction stopped working): make a hole at the base of the reservoir, allowing water to drain out completely over a 30-minute period. Some benefits: reservoir is only detached once per session, reducing force applied to bracket; water never sits for long in the reservoir; easier for me.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t stick to the shower and honestly wasn&#x27;t very good looking in the shower, so I didn&#x27;t try to stick it up a second time. It&#x27;s quite large and takes up a lot of space inside a larger shower.</li>
    <li> if you move it once, you need another stuff to tape it</li>
    <li> Genius design. A mirror I can shave in and not have to worry about constantly wiping the mirror.  Fill it with water and effortlessly drop it back on the stand.  Easy. Simple. Works perfect.  It even has a squeegee.  My only concern will be if I move.  The silicon glue that was enclosed looked pretty damn serious.  Will it come off easily?  Has this been answered somewhere and I just haven&#x27;t searched for it? Probably.  I also hope I can easily find more adhesive when I do move.</li>
    <li> This is probably my 5th different shower mirror and by far the best.  I like the large size, ease of using, and the squeegee that is included. I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants a great shave in the shower.</li>
    <li> can not see yourself..very disappointed.</li>
    <li> It was easy to install and is staying up so far! It is such a simple and effective idea. My husband raves about it.</li>
    <li> My Husband loves it. It really works well, and sticks perfectly to the shower. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror.  In fact, I just bought my second.  It is really sturdy, and truly is fogless.    As well, the customer service with this company is phenomenal.  I loved my mirror, but didn&#x27;t like where I mounted it, so I emailed them about buying more silicone and tape, and they sent me more out for free!</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this shaving mirror which is easy to use and works perfectly. It attaches firmly to the tile with the provided silicone adhesive. Carefully consider where to put it, since it attaches semi-permanently. Think about light (maybe chose the LED lighted version) and chose a spot where you won&#x27;t bump into it, since it projects about 3 inches from the wall.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it. Just what he needed and it really doesn&#x27;t fog up!</li>
    <li> One of those things that you never knew you needed until you get it, then you can&#x27;t imagine your life without it.</li>
    <li> This is the best shower mirror I have ever used.  I have had many over the years and they all wear our and don&#x27;t stay &amp;#34; fog less&amp;#34; very long.  I have had this for two years and it is still working like new.</li>
    <li> Actually fog free! I love it. Only negative is that you can&#x27;t easily move it after you&#x27;ve installed the silicon.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my husband loves it. He is now able to shave while in the shower with out missing a hair.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for and it works great.</li>
    <li> Brok right away does not stick to shower wall it was a gift disappointed with it</li>
    <li> Works just as advertised.  Once installed, it is easy to use and provides a fog-free experience.  Couldn&#x27;t shave in the shower without it.  For installation, make sure you use the silicone seal provided to attach the unit to your shower wall, as the directions suggest.  The adhesive strips will NOT support its weight.  My only complaint would be the lightweight plastic construction.  However, it is well made and hasn&#x27;t had any problems to date.</li>
    <li> Another purchase for my husband that he has used regularly.  It actually is fog free and holds up quite well.  It does have water spots that I just couldn&#x27;t prevent from forming, but that is probably just because our water is so bad here.  Overall, my husband likes this mirror a lot.</li>
    <li> This has been the very best shower mirror I have bought for my husband.  I wish I would have bought the bigger and more expensive one of this brand.  The only reason why I didn&#x27;t get the other one is because we go through them quickly because they don&#x27;t stay.  So I was a little skeptical about spending the money for the more expensive one.  This is truly the best one by far,  the reason why is because it also comes with a tube of silicone. I highly recommend this product,  take a look at purchasing the larger one.  It is more expensive but you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have shaved in the shower for years and this mirror is the best that I&#x27;ve owned. Installation was a breeze and I don&#x27;t always need to add warm water in order to shave. The product is well made works exactly the way the manufacturer says.</li>
    <li> If you feel it with hot water the fog will dissapear.&lt;br /&gt;Its nice, a little bulky on the back but nothing to worry about, since it tilts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it for this price</li>
    <li> I have waited to review this product for about a month. Installation was very easy, and I will say it does not fog at all. Not to mention it has a built in mirror cleaner, that you can just swipe and your ready to go.</li>
    <li> My wife purchased this as a gift for me. I&#x27;m glad she picked this one. It really doesn&#x27;t fog up. The squeegee is nice to have and its holder is well designed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would have been nice for the small shelf to have ridges around it. As it is, I don&#x27;t use it for my razor because I&#x27;m paranoid about it slipping off if I was to bump it.</li>
    <li> It works as advertised.  You simply fill it with hot water and there is no fog.  I would order this product again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this mirror for years, and just purchased a second one when we got to our new house (the old one had serious hard-water buildup on it, so I just bought a new one).  The company is spectacular as well.  If you need new parts (e.g. the silicon adhesive to mount it to the wall), just tell them and they send it.  When I had my first one, years ago, I was a little rough with it and the hinge stopped locking ... called them up, free replacement part - no questions asked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The process of using it is simple:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slide the mirror up off its mount, dump the water in it, fill with your current hot shower water, slide back on.  Optionally, you can run the included squeegee down the glass once to see your pretty face in unfettered glory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror stays unfogged for your entire shower.  Done and done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get this one - it&#x27;s the right one.  No chemicals, no &amp;#34;anti-fog&amp;#34; film to wear out.  Just good old physics warming the mirror from behind.</li>
    <li> This works really well. Easy to install and remains fog free as promised. I read a bunch of reviews and I a lot of research before buying this model. It&#x27;s a good buy people.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving my head for 5 years and have gone through at least 6 foggless mirrors and this is the only one that works.&lt;br /&gt;Well made and very easy to to install. Love the squeegee it comes with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;James</li>
    <li> Works as advertised.  Fill the back with warm water and you have a fog free mirror.  Have it stuck to tile and it holds nice and firm.</li>
    <li> This product is great, however, it would be nice to have a feature in it that allows for you to flush out the water after each use.  The silicone that accompanies it my husband used as a adhesive which is a great idea, no more falling mirror, but you would probably want to put it around the mirror itself, seems to leak the water a little, not a lot.&lt;br /&gt;It would also be great if the mirror came a little bigger.  Granted it is perfect for shaving but us vain people who want to watch ourselves wash our hair or look at the age lines, pimples whatever you don&#x27;t get the full face if up close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless still think it is a great mirror.  Much better than the fog-less one we bought from Sharper Image or Brookstone, forget which store.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for two years now and it works for me.  It went straight on tile in the shower and has been holding up fine.  I did have the &amp;#34;hinge&amp;#34; issue where it weakened to the point that when I filled it with water it would swing to the lowest angle.  Apparently I have an old model and this has been fixed which now leads me to their customer service...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hinge wore out after about 90 days but rather than contacting the merchant I just found a quick work around and would use a bath sponge to prop up the bottom.  After using this work around for almost 2 years my wife stopped using sponges which meant I needed to find something else to use or contact the seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given that I&#x27;ve had this for two years I emailed the seller asking if I could buy one of the new hinges.  I received an email reply in about 10 minutes asking for my address so they could send me one free of charge!  I received my new hinge 3 days later which means that they must have shipped it that day.  Wow!  Thanks for standing behind your product and for the phenomenal  customer service.</li>
    <li> Must use the silicone to ensure it didn&#x27;t fall. Pretty extensive, but it holds. Problem is that it fogs up immediately in hot shower and constantly have to wipe it to shave. I expected better quality for the price.</li>
    <li> Great product, excellent and simple design. Never fogs up and little shelf is perfect for my razor. Mirror slides out of its mount easily so you can fill/empty the hot water reservoir that prevents the fogging. Mounting is easy and no drilling was required. This mirror will be a part of my shower for years.</li>
    <li> Have used a round WM mirror, and a BBB mirror. Neither comes remotely close to this one. It&#x27;s awesome. Simple to install. Works perfectly. No struggling to keep it clear during my shower. And since I save my head as well, the tilting option is a HUGE bonus. Great product!</li>
    <li> Easy to install and FOG FREE! Finally!!! Thank you ToiletTree!</li>
    <li> AWESOME! For those that are a little confused, you fill the compartment behind the mirror with hot water, or the same temperature of water you take your shower in. The compartment is not something that you disconnect. The mirror is one piece and the compartment is behind it. When you are done taking your shower, you simply remove the mirror from it&#x27;s base (pedestal) and dump the water out. I always forget this part after taking my shower and find myself doing it each time before I take my next shower. I must get into a rhythm with this part, but it does work flawlessly. There is a squeegee that comes with the mirror so that you can wisk the water off the mirror after filling it, since you will have water on the mirror most likely. Once set up there is absolutely no fog and I can see myself clearly while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kit will come with tape and silicone to mount securely on your shower wall, and will work on glass, plastic, or tiled shower walls.</li>
    <li> This product works well, doesn&#x27;t fog after it&#x27;s filled, and so far has not fell off the wall.  It&#x27;s all I could ask of it.  Good product.</li>
    <li> It really remains fog-free and adheres very well to shower tile.  The price is right also.  Only wish it came in antiqued brass.</li>
    <li> I have had two different mirrors fall from the wall and shatter into pieces over the past 6 months.  The first time it happened, I called the company and they sent me a new one, no questions asked.  So top marks for customer service there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now the second one has done the same thing (and this time after additionally using a second tube of silicone adhesive).  It just isn&#x27;t reliable to stay on the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both times that it fell, the back of the actual piece that is adhered to the wall looked as if no adhesive had ever been attached (whereas I now have two different areas on my role shower walls with silicone adhesive still attached.  It is obvious that the adhesive does not adhere to the plastic frame long-term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Off to find a better option...</li>
    <li> We have had this product before - in fact this it the third.  It replaces one we had only had for a few months.  The first one lasted a long time.  Not sure what happened with the second.  The silver just started peeling off on the inside.  This one seems OK so far.</li>
    <li> This is the absolutely the best fogless shower mirror I ever bought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this mirror more than 5 years. The friction lock which my husband temporarily fixed 2 years ago broke again recently. And the mirror is not as clear as it used to be, so I think it is time for a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it would be wonderful if they improve the friction lock issue, but I can definitely afford a new one every 5 years.</li>
    <li> I got this item from my wishlist for xmas.  It worked great for the first few months.  After that though, water permeated the mirror material (cardboard??)  and distorted the mirror so much I wasn&#x27;t able to use it effectively.  It pissed me off enough that I ripped it off the wall.  Now I have a big ugly splotch of cured silicon stuck to my shower wall.  Thanks toilettree!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I got really good customer service from Toiletree on this after my review here.  I have a replacement mirror to install and I will update this in a few months based on how it performs.  In the meantime I have bumped my rating to 3 stars based on the customer service alone...</li>
    <li> AFTER A MONTH AND A HALF OF USING THE MIRROR THE MIRROR SURFACE IS DISAPPEARING.LITTLE BY LITTLE A LINE ACROSS THE BOTTOM OF THE MIRROR HAS NO REFLECTION AS THOUGH IT IS CHIPPED AWAY.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE SECOND FOGLESS SHOWER MIRROR THAT I HAVE OWNED,  IT IS THE ONLY SHOWER SHAVING  MIRROR THAT ACTUALLY ALWAYS WORKS.  . I&#x27;M MOVING AND I NEEDED TO PURCHASE ANOTHER MIRROR FOR MY NEW BATHROOM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COUDOS THE YOUR COMPANY AND A GREAT PRODUCT., THANK GOODNESS FOR AMAZON .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ED IN ALBUQUERQUE, NM</li>
    <li> This mirror came early first of all. I got it two days before it was estimated to arrive. Product came out of the box looking great. I followed the instructions, which were very easy to understand, and installed the mirror. I let it sit 24 hours per he instructions. First time in the shower I filled it with water, and NO FOG!!!! The little squeegee thing is a nice feature. My only complaint is that I didn&#x27;t order he one with a light. My shower isn&#x27;t dark, and it might not have even made a difference, but I would like to see how the lighted version works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mirror is holding fast o the wall, and hasn&#x27;t fogged up yet, unless I didn&#x27;t put water in it. This is a great product from a great company and I would not only recommend this, but I am hinting of giving it as gifts!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;07/27/2014&lt;br /&gt;Well it finally happened. A few days ago the mirror let loose. A little over 1 year from purchase, the bracket things that connects to the wall came loose. The mirror made a tremendous crashing sound, and it found my mirror lying in the bottom of my tub. I do want to make it clear that the mirror did not break, even when falling about 6 feet from where it was mounted on my wall to the tub floor where I found it. The little squeegee thing had come out of it&#x27;s holding slot. But really, I mean I was surprised it wasn&#x27;t damaged after that kind of fall and impact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also want to make it clear that the mirror was still attached to the bracket, even after the fall. The impact shifted the angle of tilt for the mirror, but the mirror and bracket were still intact. I could have re-attached the bracket to the wall, but I accidentally broke the clip post thing on one side, so the mirror will now not click into place. But I caused that problem, until I broke the post I planned to get some silicone and remount the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I inspected what happened, if looks to me like I didn&#x27;t apply the silicone exactly how I should have, and that is what caused the bracket to come loose. Originally  I tried to apply silicone to some other areas to \\&quot;help\\&quot; the bracket be more secure, and in doing so, I failed to apply the silicone correctly. So I don&#x27;t fault the company or product for coming loose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not be re-purchasing this product however because it did have one major flaw. No light. I see I can get the lighted version of this mirror for a little more and so I am going to upgrade to the lighted version. And I am doing that happily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mirror was very durable and very effective. Once I put the water in, there was no fog. I love shaving in the shower, and this mirror was excellent for that. I have absolutely 0 buyer&#x27;s remorse. I have already highly suggested this product to family and friends. This mirror works incredibly well. The image is clean and clear, and it does not fog up. This is an excellent product from an excellent company. I am not even hesitant in purchasing the lighted version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I myself simply can not believe the negative ratings for this product. I have really enjoyed this mirror and would buy it again in a heartbeat if not for the lighted model. If you want a fog free mirror for your shower, I couldn&#x27;t recommend this one enough. I can&#x27;t see how you could be disappointed. I wasn&#x27;t. This mirror was great!</li>
    <li> May, 2013 -- So one of the features of this mirror is that you can set it at a comfortable angle once it is filled with water.  Just as many others have said, after about 6 months, the mirror no longer stays on the angle I need, because the teeth which are supposed to hold it in place wear out under the weight of the water.  Now it just flops down, facing the floor, useless to me.  Don&#x27;t waster your money on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;June, 2013 -- After posting my review I heard directly from the President of Toilet Tree.  He apologized, and said that the defect in the product has been corrected, and sent me a replacement mirror, which works exactly as advertised.  I can now recommend this product.  It does what it says, and the company was very responsive.  Kudos to them for fixing the problem, and for being so consumer-friendly!</li>
    <li> Absolutely fog free, great mounting,excellent clarity. I haven&#x27;t seen my face this well  for a shower shave in over 30  years.I wear glasses, but this mirror compensates for not having them on, incredible!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this mirror a few weeks now, and man what a difference shaving in the shower can make. Easy, fast, and smooth.  Great idea at a great price!</li>
    <li> This fogless shower mirror works perfectly.  It is impossible for it to fog up when it is filled with hot water, and will stay fogless the entire time you are in the shower, so in that, it does its job perfectly.  There are only 2 reasons that I didn&#x27;t give this a 5-star review, and they are probably too picky.  First, the mirror is kind of distorted.  Not really a big deal, honestly.  Second, the plastic squeegee handle warps easily, making it pretty worthless.  This could be solved by a minor engineering change, but then again, I didn&#x27;t buy this product for the squeegee.  I bought it to use in my shower and to not have it fog up, and it does that perfectly.</li>
    <li> Liked it so much I took it with me on my move! Just adding hot or warm water to the reservoirs keeps it fog free and easy on your eyes.</li>
    <li> this product is excellent I&#x27;ve been using for a few years now and provides a great tool to use to shave in the shower, really works and stays clear</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and well packaged!  My husband loves this mirror as he always shaves in the shower. The only one we have found that truly does not fog.</li>
    <li> I was so pleased with the Fogless Shower Mirror with Squeegee by ToiletTree that I bought a second one for our summer home on Nantucket. It is easy to attach to the shower and I never have any fog on the mirror. I&#x27;ve had a number of other shower mirrors and none of them can match the quality of the ToiletTree product.</li>
    <li> Very happy with purchase. Simply works as advertised if directions are followed. Not bad aesthetically either.</li>
    <li> The mirror FELL from the shower wall and broke into pieces after 6 months of use!</li>
    <li> Excellent fog control. Easy to use. Only problem is that it has to be permanently glued to shower wall.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm! Way better than the garbage mirror I had before.</li>
    <li> I used to have an anti-fog shower mirror that installed between the inlet pipe and shower head and it worked great.  The only problem being the inflexibility of the position.  I thought then...there must be a better way.  Then I moved and installed a great looking anti-fog mirror in my new shower, convinced this must be the \\&quot;better way.\\&quot;  But it started falling off the glass about every three or four days.  Even worse, when it was a few weeks old it started fogging badly.  The only way I could shave with it was to hold my breath.  The reflective surface never was really like a mirror... but it was good enough until it started fogging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I ran across the ToiletTree shower mirror on Amazon.  It has a reservoir that you fill with hot shower water.  It WILL NOT FOG, the reflective surface is very near real mirror quality, and the mounting method (a combination of two-sided tape and removable silicone glue) is fantastic.  This anti-fog mirror is the BETTER WAY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like the comfort and ease of shaving in the shower and you&#x27;ve been disappointed with other so-called anti-fog mirrors...you have to try this one.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Works great, just fill it up with warm water and you get a nice fog free mirror to shave with.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it says it does, when using you just gotta find the right distance between you ad the mirror to avoid that fun house mirror effect, one thing i do not like about the stand tho is when i go to adjust the tilt it seems to need alot of force to get it to move and it makes a loud click and it makes nervous almost everytime i have to adjust it. I am just hoping that it takes some loosening to make that go away, but other then that i love this mirror.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this mirror.  The concept of filling it with your shower water to keep it from fogging is genius, yet follows basic laws of thermodynamics: a smooth surface that is colder than the surrounding warm moist environment will fog, so make it the same temperature as the environment.  Though that being said, if you forget and leave the water in the mirror from your last shower, it will get cold and in your next shower it will fog up if you don&#x27;t replace it with warm water.  This is also why they cleverly included the squeegee, which is key since you&#x27;ll get water all over it while filling it up.  And since it is holding up about a cup of water, you will definitely want to make sure you follow the instructions to glue it to your shower wall - suction cups or double-sided tape alone won&#x27;t hold that.  All in all, a very satisfying purchase.</li>
    <li> This mirror is well designed and adequate. It won&#x27;t fog up. The water accumulation on the surface reduces visibility but not too much.</li>
    <li> Plastic, Yes - China, Yes. Appears to be a good product, works as advertised, good mirror, a little difficult to adjust. A good value.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for almost two years and it has worked like a charm. One of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> We ended up returning returning this mirror because it was not equipped with a light. The deluxe model turned out to be a better choice with a light.</li>
    <li> It is true. It is fogless. And that in itself is pretty amazing. I love the concept and how it works. But we have now put it in the cabinet, no longer using it, hoping for a replacement or refund.&lt;br /&gt;The mirror part is not glass and is totally WARPED (I assume from the hot shower water) after only 2 months of use. It now behaves as a funhouse mirror making shaving impossible. So in the end, it didn&#x27;t really matter that it was fogless.&lt;br /&gt;Would have been MUCH better off buying a cheap fogless mirror and just replacing it periodically.</li>
    <li> GREAT product!! I bought it for my fiance, dad, and brother and they all LOVE it!!  I think I used it more than my fiance!  So easy to use and adheres well to the shower wall!  Thank you ToiletTree Products!</li>
    <li> Mirror does fog up in hot shower and have to keep wiping to see thru it. wall Mounting is good</li>
    <li> Installation was easy and it looks like it will hold up.  Mirror doesn&#x27;t fog up during shower and I&#x27;m left and my face winds up silky smooth and irritation-free!</li>
    <li> After having purchased several shaving mirrors in the last few years and loving none of them very well, I think I may have finally found one worthy of a good recommendation.  The ToiletTree Fogless Shaving Mirror does not use suction cups which don&#x27;t \\&quot;suck\\&quot; very well, but instead permanently adheres to the wall using a silicone adhesive (not sure what happens when I need to take it off the shower wall but I am not doing that anytime soon).  The secret to the \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; mirror is the fact that you fill the mirror (or the back of the mirror) with warm water so that you don&#x27;t get condensation on the mirror when you shave.  It works great!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only little nit with this product is that the shelf that fits under the mirror is pretty lame and only holds two small razors and then just barely.  They could have designed a bit bigger shelf to hold things.  However, this is only a small nit, and doesn&#x27;t detract from the overall usability of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good value for the money!</li>
    <li> Before install I was concerned because I really didn&#x27;t think it would live up to my expectations. I ordered this as a surprise for my husband and after his first use he was extremely happy! I was really concerned about having to fill it with water before each use, however, my concerns were unfounded. My husband loved it and said it was very easy to take off and put back on its mount!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this shower mirror for several weeks now, and I&#x27;m very pleased with it. It was easy to mount, and works exactly as advertised. As long as you remember to fill the reservoir (which is extremely simple), there&#x27;s never any fog whatsoever. Definitely worth purchasing if you shave in the shower!</li>
    <li> LOVE, love, love this mirror! It works better than any other mirror I&#x27;ve ever had! I was hesitant to buy this at first, but after reading the reviews from others, I decided to try it. Totally happy with it, and I have it on my windowsill inside my shower instead of mounting it, and since it tilts up and down, it&#x27;s perfect for my husband to shave in the shower as well.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as advertised. I purchased this thinking I could shave a few minutes off my morning routine by shaving in the shower. Completely works - clear image, solid, does exactly what it says and does it well. Great customer service as well! 5 out of 5.</li>
    <li> From the picture, I had assumed that you could simply stand up the mirror and fill it with water to use.  Nope.  You need to glue it to the wall, and then lift the mirror part off and on every time.  If you don&#x27;t mount it to the wall, then the water throws it off balance and it falls down. I like to move the mirror to different angles, which you cannot do if it is mounted. Too bad, is a great idea but annoying to use and limiting.</li>
    <li> We don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a good product yet since it arrived with an empty tube of silicone to mount it with. If we can get what we need to mount it, we&#x27;ll let you know if it&#x27;s any good.</li>
    <li> I hate to shave.I really hate to shave at the sink before or after I take a shower. I have always shaved in the shower because the hot water loosens my beard/stubble. I also don&#x27;t have to worry about shaving creme getting everywhere around the sink. This mirror is awesome! I pour hot water in the top opening, and then put my razor in the water so it can get hot. The mirror comes with a squeegee to remove droplets of water. Very well designed product!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband. The one he had was always falling down. He loves this one, said it works great with no fogging, just as advertised! Glad I made the purchase!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend. He had used shower mirrors before, but said this one was by far the best!!</li>
    <li> Fogged up after one week, complete waste of money. Not worth it at all. I&#x27;m going up ask for a refund and purchase one from somewhere else</li>
    <li> Annie&#x27;s husband here. I bought my first one several years ago, and every time I move, I buy a new one (I suppose I could re-use them, but I&#x27;m too lazy to find out if there&#x27;s similar adhesive that you can buy apart from the mirror). I tried another fogless mirror previously, one that actually attached to the shower head and had water running through it, but it was a pain to use. I really like this one from ToiletTree, and wouldn&#x27;t be without one. You can mount it wherever you want, and it&#x27;s very easy to fill its reservoir with hot water before lowering the temperature of the water I actually shower with. I recommend it very highly.</li>
    <li> The first truly fogLESS mirror I have ever used.  Easy to install, easy to use, so simple I actually took the time to write.  Very impressive, and reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Mirror works and does not fog up. Mine only stayed up for 4 days (followed all the directions/cleaned tile with alcohol etc.)then the adhesive came off of the mount (remained on my bath tile). I emailed customer service and they responded the next day and sent me additional adhesive and mounting squares for free. Awesome customer support. Hopefully the mirror stays up for a while this time.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and the product lived up to my expectations, and then some!  I installed the product as directed months ago and I haven&#x27;t seen any signs of it failing.  It is fool proof and works fantastically.  Forget all the bells &amp; whistles on more expensive models...this one is perfect and I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Does as described! Highly recommend it</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the Fogless Shower Mirror for my husband and he seems very pleased.  Nice size and does the job.</li>
    <li> my husband loved this present uses it to shave in the shower. wish I bought the bigger one but this is awesome!</li>
    <li> Does exactly as it claims to. Nice to have a mirror that won&#x27;t fall and stays clear. Put it up about 2 weeks ago. So far, so good.</li>
    <li> I have tried quite a few mirrors before this one.  After fogging up after couple uses and the suction cup falling off the wall, I had enough.  This mirror has been absolutely flawless.  I was skeptical of the mounting, but after following the instructions exactly  as written, this mount will be installed until the house gets knocked down.  Probably can hold ten times the weight of the mirror.  This mirror is the \\&quot;Do it once, and do it right\\&quot; solution to shaving in the shower.  A permanent answer to a aggravating problem with the cheap-o mirrors.  Definitely worth the money and then some.</li>
    <li> The ToiletTree fogless shower mirror is everything the description states. Its easy to install and does not fog up if you fill the reservoir with hot water. Great product and great quality. I have purchased several shower mirrors in the past and they were all garbage. This one finally met all expectations.</li>
    <li> Finally I have a fog less mirror that works. It&#x27;s easy to install and I thought filling it with hot water would be a hassle but it was so simple.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had two previous shower mirrors and they got clouded over and over time the suction cups did not hold.&lt;br /&gt;This one comes with silicon glue so it&#x27;s not going anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;I also have the nasal hair remover from Toilet Tree Products. It&#x27;s by far better than more expensive ones I have purchased in the past.&lt;br /&gt;The blade broke on that one and instead of sending me a blade they just sent a brand new one.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very unpressed with this company.</li>
    <li> Very easy to install, follow directions, wait 24 hours, attach mirror, been using it about 2 weeks, great getting out of the shower and not worrying about shaving, great product.</li>
    <li> Loved this mirror but fell off the shower wall in the middle of the night after 6 months.</li>
    <li> I received this a gift, so no \\&quot;Amazon Verified Purchase\\&quot; tag on this one.    The idea is great and it works perfectly.  You fill it up with water while you&#x27;re in the shower and it does not fog.  It&#x27;s as simple as that.  The one star is for a simple reason: after six months of use the mirror coating started falling off.  Now, after a year, the mirror is barely usable since a good portion of the mirror has been washed down the drain.  I mounted a mirror in my shower with silicone and it&#x27;s lasted less than a year.  It is only receiving one star because it worked so well (before it started falling apart).    ***EDIT***    It gets two more stars because of great customer service.  The company contacted me and sent me a replacement mirror.  He said in an email, \\&quot;We had this problem with a very small amount of our inventory and have since changed the backing we use on the mirror.\\&quot;    I received the mirror a few days later and have been using it since.  I am going to give it a few months to see how it performs as he also said it should last me a long time.  If it really does last a long time I&#x27;ll probably add a couple more stars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a mirror that I can use in the shower that;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Sticks to the wall and doesn&#x27;t fall off&lt;br /&gt;2) Doesn&#x27;t fog&lt;br /&gt;3) Is big enough&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first that meets all of my criteria. It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> Great product  A little pricey but night and day better than the $10 dept store metal shower mirrors</li>
    <li> I purchased this mirror in September.  Initially, no complaints, but in December I noticed a constant drip from one of the corners at the bottom.  Within a month I noticed a decrease in water volume.  This has increased steadily to the point that I have to refill the reservoir in the middle of the shower to keep it fog free.  Never dropped it.  Has adhered to the wall perfectly.  Apparently the weight of the water has caused the seams to separate.  I even tried re-sealing with a bead of silicone to no avail.  Looking for a replacement.</li>
    <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Easy to install&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually look forward to shaving every day! Never fogs up and well built&lt;br /&gt;Better than expected</li>
    <li> Best shower mirror I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> This is perfect.  My husband loved it so much at our old house, when we built our new house, it was one of the first things I ordered to make sure he had one in the new shower!!</li>
    <li> Behind this mirror is the space that the user can fill with water that is supposed to keep the mirror from fogging up. BIG problem... The mirror grossly deforms your reflection because the mirror bulges out due to the weight of the water behind the mirror.</li>
    <li> Well built, great attachment method for any type wall.  No fogging problems and a very clear reflection.  Really beats the cheaper model I bought earlier.  If it disappeared today I&#x27;d buy another of the same model tomorrow.</li>
    <li> Great company/product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally a shower mirror that works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having gone through a pretty good number of supposed non-fog shower mirrors and always being disappointed, I was really happy with this mirror - it works great!</li>
    <li> We are always in search of a fogless mirror that doesn&#x27;t fog up.  My husband only likes to shave in the shower and this one seems to work well.  I don&#x27;t really like that it attached to the wall with tape instead of suction cups, but that has nothing to do with function.</li>
    <li> This was more expensive than I wanted to pay, but the reviews were good, so I ordered it.  It was billed as a fogless mirror that would never need sprays or cleaning to remain fogless.  The product came well packaged and in tact.  I fastened it to the wall using the adhesive strips that came with it.  It was great for about a week.  It did work well when you filled the reservoir behind the mirror with hot shower water.  However, about a week into use, it let loose from the wall and fell on the shower floor.  It was undamaged so I reattached it to the wall, this time using the adhesive that had come in the packaging.  The following day, it fell off the wall again and this time the reservoir was full so the force of the fall broke the mirror frame off the front and now I am left holding a mirror plate in my hand and trying to shave.  Of course, it fogs up because there is no warm shower water agains the back of the mirror.  It was a waste of nearly $40.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t think there could be such a thing as a fogless shower mirror. It&#x27;s incredibly easy to use and works like a charm, the shelf underneath is also a great touch. If you have a dark shower you may want to invest in the upgraded one with LEDs in the frame (I wish I had). Hanging the mirror is easy BUT it is permenant.</li>
    <li> The title of my review says is all. Follow the instructions and you will not be unhappy with this.&lt;br /&gt;J.</li>
    <li> Like it, would love it if it would magnify</li>
    <li> Works as advertised!!!</li>
    <li> As described. Works well.</li>
    <li> I ordered this hoping to do a better job shaving, doing so in the steam of the shower makes it comfortable on my face.  I told some friends of my purchase and they said every shower mirror fogs...This one does not!  You fill it with warm or hot water and your good to go!  Very good product.</li>
    <li> It was a great mirror until it fell off the shower wall..... When it was on the wall, it was fogless and lived up to it&#x27;s description.</li>
    <li> husband LOVES it. says it NEVER gets foggy.</li>
    <li> Works just as it says. Easy to put up, doesn&#x27;t fog, is everything I was looking for in a shower mirror. When I moved I took it down, and re-hung it at the new place using those 3M adhesives that specifically said they were for the &amp;#34;outdoors&amp;#34;. And the thing is still on the wall.</li>
    <li> Product was just as advertised</li>
    <li> gift for son-in-law who loves it. It strong and stays up on wall with no fog. Fast shipping too.</li>
    <li> It works great.  Installation was a breeze.  Couldn&#x27;t be  happier</li>
    <li> This mirror was purchased to replace an older cheaper version. It is a quality shower mirror as compared to those I have seen and used.</li>
    <li> Now I can see my glorious image when I attempt to change God&#x27;s great design by shaving!</li>
    <li> Excellent. I&#x27;m getting a much more precise shave now.</li>
    <li> Works fantastic, only down side in my opinion is it is not made from real glass.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these for my dad and one for my husband. Both have complained about numerous fogless mirrors in the past. Both have been using this for 6 months now and like it. It is easy to use and truly stays fogless.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror about 4 months ago, so I am now confident to write a review of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The GOOD:&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s really fogless.  No doubt about it.  If you use as directed you can shave and it will remaing fogless for a long time.  I take a long time to shower, and it&#x27;s never fogged up before I&#x27;m done.&lt;br /&gt;- Good quality of materials&lt;br /&gt;- Very good size and easy to install&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The NOT SO GOOD:&lt;br /&gt;- The surface of the mirror (at least mine), is not perfectly flat.  So, if I&#x27;m looking at it and move my head to the sides, it kind of distorts the image a little bit, kind of what happens with funhouse mirrors.  I think the manufacturer might want to look into making sure the material is very flat, so there is no image distortion.  If you get closer to the mirror, the distortion is reduced and you will have no problems with it, but it made me dizzy until I got used to it.  A fix to this would make this mirror absolutely perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I had bought this a couple years ago and never had any problems.  The design is extremely simple to use and incredibly effective.  I had used others that would fog up over time or become unclear, but this one never does either.  Changing out the water takes only a few seconds and installation couldn&#x27;t have been easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just moved to a new place and bought a new one because I did not have the adhesives to take down my other and reapply it, and it was a purchase I was happy to make again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a fogfree shower mirror, I couldn&#x27;t recommend one any higher than this one.</li>
    <li> The build is pretty cheap but ultimately it has worked flawlessly in my shower for more than a year now. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I purchased this fogless mirror for my husband and he was delighted!  Others we have bought fell off the shower wall almost immediately.  I don&#x27;t this one falling off any time soon.  The mirror is very well made and the mirror is indeed fogless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the purchase experience, nothing more than perfect.  My order was placed immediately and I was very surprised and delighted to receive my package in such a short time.  I haven&#x27;t had to need to contact the vendor, but I am positive they would help me with any problems I might have.</li>
    <li> Wish I would have bought the one with the light. It&#x27;s hard to see in the shower with this.</li>
    <li> We moved into a new house so it was time for a new shower mirror.&lt;br /&gt;I picked up an el cheapo at Walmart which stuck to the tile for about a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then went to amazon to find a good one and came across this.&lt;br /&gt;It really is a good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First it comes with a large tube of adhesive in addition to double stick tape.&lt;br /&gt;There are areas intended for the application of the adhesive clearly marked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really holds well and I have no doubt that it will stay put.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also it comes with a squidgy for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I has a nice reservoir for warm water to keep the mirror from fogging but I just do as I did with all my previous mirrors. After I wash my hair I run my hand over the mirror covering it w/shampoo then throw a handful of water on it and this keeps it from fogging while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When finished I throw a couple more handsful of water to get all the shampoo off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whenever I read some of the reviews that get 4.5 stars I always wonder about the 1 ratings. Bottom line is I always purchase the product with a 4.5 rating and have never had a problem with any of them (just don&#x27;t read the bad reviews).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chet</li>
    <li> Awesome product!  Bought one for my son in law and it worked so well I had to replace my hubby&#x27;s with this one.  Best fogless shower mirror he has ever used!  He loves it!!!</li>
    <li> This was actually purchased as a gift for a friend because I received one of these for Christmas in 2013 and when he used it at my house, he was very impressed with it.  I waited a long time to put it up, because that&#x27;s what happens at my house.  When I finally got around to it, installation was pretty easy, you just have to let it sit overnight while the adhesive cures.  Some of the reviews complain about having to fill it with water every time you use it and then remember to empty it, but those two actions combined take less than 10 seconds total.  It works exactly like it is supposed to, and doesn&#x27;t fog up when it has warm water in the reservoir.  Some of the reviews also complain about the size, or the distortion of the mirror, but I don&#x27;t have an issue with the size, and I can only see a tiny amount of distortion all the way at the very edge of the mirrored surface.  Why anyone would complain about that, I have no idea.  It has not affect on its use whatsoever.  I&#x27;ve had this installed for 9 months or so now, and it is still securely attached to the wall and hasn&#x27;t shown any signs of loosening.  I shave about 2-3 times per week, and I have tile walls in my bathroom.  Your mileage may vary, depending on use rates and wall material, but I have a hard time believing it would come off regardless, as long as you follow the instructions.</li>
    <li> The shameless self-promotion of this aside, it really is the best shower mirror I&#x27;ve found.  After 2 years of using it, the mirror still looks new and it does not fog.  The shelf is convenient and the build-in squeegee is brilliant.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have had several shower mirrors over the years and I had gone a while without one.  This is the best one I have ever had.  In the past I had mounted one to the shower head that had shower water run through it but there were several drawbacks to it.  It got mineral deposit build up and you were looking up into the shower head to shave.  Eventually I replaced my shower head and the bigger head would not allow for that mirror to be mounted so I tossed it. Another unit had audio built into it with a remote transmitter you could hook  up to your phone or MP3 player, but it was suction cup mounted and eventually it stopped working after falling off and crashing in the shower.  This was especially disturbing during the night!  The mirror on that did not work great and I was constantly treating it with sprays to keep it from fogging.  Also, hooking it up with the audio jack was time consuming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like shaving in the shower I suggest that you go with this product.  You will be glad you did because it works great and you don&#x27;t have to worry about it falling off the wall.  Maybe one day in the future they will release one with Bluetooth built in which would be the ultimate, but in the mean time this is the way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filling it and dumping it is not a big deal.  Clearing the surface with the squeegee gives you a really clear reflection.  Here is a tip, I clear it right before I leave the shower (after the water is off) to keep water spots from forming on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope that helps!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RC</li>
    <li> This was super easy to put up, doesn&#x27;t fog, and also has stayed up for months now. It does exactly what you expect.</li>
    <li> Mirror works fantastic and is everything it says it is. I&#x27;ve always had a problem trying to find a shaving mirror that will work in a tile shower and the search is over. This is it!!! Seems to adhere well to tile.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my dad this year. He shaves and brushes his teeth in the shower and complains about missing spots and a place to put razor/toothbrush. This fits his needs perfectly! A great product, shipped quickly and in perfect condition! I also got the gift wrap with the special note and it looked fantastic!</li>
    <li> Great quality - works perfectly!  I LOVE the little shelf for my razor and the little squeegee for wiping down the water droplets after I get out of the shower.  It remained totally fog-free!</li>
    <li> By far the best fogless shower mirror I&#x27;ve ever used.. Easy to use and the lights are are great plus..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had it for less than a week but so far it works as described. Fill it up with hot water and it doesn&#x27;t fog.</li>
    <li> This mirror is genius! most mirrors fog up after 5 minutes in the shower but this one has a water duct that completely prevents that. This is definitely the best shower mirror I have ever had. Worth every penny</li>
    <li> I have bought many mirrors for my husband that said they were fog free and they were not! this one really works as long as you&lt;br /&gt;fill the back with hot water. I like the little squeegee that came with it and how it is has it own holder so you don&#x27;t lose it and it also tilts so&lt;br /&gt;I can use it as well. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> You could probably work more quality into this product but it is the best  device I have ever purchased for personal grooming. I&#x27;m saving about 3 to 4 gallons of water a day. if I miss a spot shaving it&#x27;s gone in a jiffy. I have wanted something like this for 20 years. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> The fogless mirror works exactly as advertised.  Been using it for about 4 months now without any issues.  Fill the reservoir up with warm water and the fog disappears almost instantly.  Really happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I got this for my fiancé for Christmas and he absolutely loves it. It was easy to hang and it doesn&#x27;t slip at all. I take really long showers and it still doesn&#x27;t fog.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best shower mirror that I have found.  It is easy to use and care for, and it works!</li>
    <li> This product is all plastic and is large enough for my needs as a shower mirror.  I use it for shaving and it works just fine.&lt;br /&gt;It has a small shelf big enough to hold a razor and a few extra blades. It is not big enough for a can of shaving cream, but can hold a bar of soap, or shaving gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item is glued to the wall of your shower.  So get it in the right place the first time.  If you like things level, you should have a small level with you too when applying to your shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Mirror is plastic and is not glass, but works well.&lt;br /&gt;If you fill it up with warm/hot shower water it will not fog!!  I especially like that part!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line, is that this product does the job I want and need it to do.  I like it very much and works much better than any other mirror I have attempted to glue to my shower wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this product.</li>
    <li> A true rarity: a product&#x27;s performance matching (even exceeding) its advertising claims. What a pleasure it is, jumping into the shower and knowing I can see well enough to give myself a decent shave.</li>
    <li> This mirror does indeed stay free of fog, providing a clear, if mildly distorted reflection.  The surface isn&#x27;t completely flat, and thus there&#x27;s slight fun-house effect one might expect from a warped surface.  But the distortion is minor and doesn&#x27;t really interfere with shaving.  The up-down swivel is very stiff, so it&#x27;s a good thing there aren&#x27;t two people of different heights that want to use this mirror.  I think daily adjustment would probably result in breakage pretty quickly.  Mine hasn&#x27;t broken, but I&#x27;m not going to test it.  There&#x27;s also no horizontal (left-right) adjustment, so you can&#x27;t stick it in the corner unless you want to stand up against the side wall to see yourself.  The fog-free mechanism is simple--just fill with warm water and the reflective surface stays warm enough to prevent fog.  Dump the water when done.&lt;br /&gt;The reflective surface is as clear as glass--it&#x27;s a good mirror--but it might be some kind of plastic.  I&#x27;m not certain, and again I don&#x27;t want to test it for fear of breaking it or scratching it.&lt;br /&gt;The adhesive SAYS it&#x27;s removable, but it appears to be silicon caulk, so don&#x27;t count on it being easily removable.  You&#x27;re going to mount this one time and one time only.  Once it&#x27;s up, it&#x27;ll stay up, and removing it will probably destroy the base.  In any case, you only have enough mounting adhesive for one try.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a good product.  Not perfect, but good enough.</li>
    <li> 1.  Product arrived quickly and safely.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Product was packaged nicely.&lt;br /&gt;3.  The company&#x27;s owner/manager contacted me via E-mail with some quick guide tips on installing, using, and maintaining the product.&lt;br /&gt;4.  The director of marketing E-mailed me and mentioned that if I&#x27;m not satisfied with the product to contact her immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If a company takes all these steps to insure that you have received your product timely, safely, and are completely satisfied with using it, then how can you go wrong?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product, company, and corporate culture (in the above respects.  Keep up the wonderful work everyone!</li>
    <li> Second mirror we purchased.  First one did not work at all.  This one is great!  I have a happy husband!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror for my husband. He really likes it. It does not fog up, it is very stable, it has an innovative design, and it is visually appealing (as visually appealing as a shower mirror can be). We have to be careful to empty the water from it each day as I am concerned that having standing water in the cahmber could get gross - so far so good. I also wonder about the day when I will have to take it off the wall - as you need to use the entire tube of provided adhesive to apply it along with the double sided tape. I will someday find out.&lt;br /&gt;Oveall - it is working great and we are very pleased with it. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Yes, it&#x27;s THAT good. My husband loves it. I tried it out to see if it worked an yes, it stays fog~free the entire hot shower.would definitely recommend</li>
    <li> Easy to fill with hot water and it keeps the mirror fog free.  My husband is very happy with this for shaving in the shower.</li>
    <li> Just as advertised!  Quick to install, NO Fog.  This is my third mirror, two at our main home and one at our vacation home.  New double stick tape on the back makes install very easy.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I have shaved in the shower for the last 35 years, and have finally ended the 35-year search for a truly fogless mirror. This ToiletTree mirror is fogless and practically distortion-free. Wonderful product. Thank you.</li>
    <li> FYI you put water in the top of the mirror it lifts off the base and this keeps if from fogging up then you empty the water when done!</li>
    <li> My husband loves to shave while he showers. This mirror is truly fogless. The squeegee is a great idea, helping to keep the mirror clear. Was definitely a great gift.</li>
    <li> NOTE: Does not use suction cups!  If you are looking for one that uses suction cups this is not the mirror for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate suction cups they always fall off the wall eventually and your mirror breaks.  This mirror comes with silicon glue to attache the mirror to the wall.  Silicon is removable with a razor blade so I am not too worried about removal some day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works as descried, now we will just have to wait and see if it holds up for several years.</li>
    <li> I have gone thru quite a few shaving mirrors that claim to be no fog but in the end always do, so far (I have had this one a month)it does exactly as advertised, it does not fog. I am very pleased. If something changes I will do a followup but for now its a great mirror to shave by in the shower.</li>
    <li> Excellent mirror for shower! Larger than many and great shelf and feature with water container to keep mirror from fogging!</li>
    <li> After years of buying \\&quot;disposable\\&quot;, crappy fogless mirrors, this is the best by far.&lt;br /&gt;With a simple, light frame it works great and it looks like new after two years of everyday use...&lt;br /&gt;Simply great!</li>
    <li> The concept of this mirror is great. It&#x27;s much easier for me to shave in the shower and keep the mess off the sink. It does need improving. First thing is, make the mirror bigger. Make it double the size. I hate having to scrunch to see what I&#x27;m doing in a mirror this small. The second thing is to make it not distort/warp. When it was new, I don&#x27;t remember the mirror being distorted. Now, almost the entire mirror is warped. It&#x27;s like shaving in a fun house mirror, but not very fun.</li>
    <li> I really like being able to shave in the shower. I hot shave is so much easier and having a fog proof mirror really makes that much easier. My only concern is with the silicon application - it would be nice if the mirror was movable. Once you stick it in place you will need more of the silicon and double-sided tape in order to re-apply it somewhere else. It could also be slightly larger, but it works.</li>
    <li> so far just great.  it works as advertised!</li>
    <li> Truly fogless.  The warm water keeps the mirror the same temp as the environment, so condensation isn&#x27;t possible.  A must have, especially if you travel</li>
    <li> Very sturdily sticks to the shower wall with included adhesive. Shelf is handy, although most shaving cream containers are too thick to fit on it and behind the mirror. Just fill up the top with hot water at the beginning of your shower and it stays fog free. That simple. Included squeegee is cleverly tucked away in the front of the shelf and wicks away water bubbles easily. Great purchase all around!</li>
    <li> Great mirror, only issue I have is that you have to refil the water tank each time to keep it fog free. However, I guess thats what you have to do in order to have a true fog-less mirror.</li>
    <li> The mirror gives a warped screen. I would not buy this again nor will I suggest this for anyone.</li>
    <li> My cousin and her husband have this in all of their bathrooms, and I just had to copy! Love this mirror!</li>
    <li> I purchased the mirror 3 months ago and have been using it continuously since then. In my experience, the product works as advertised and does exactly what it is supposed to do...fogless shaving reflection. The issue about distortion because it is made of plastic is not valid, given the close distance between my face and the mirror. From across the room it might be a problem, but not for close-up shaving. Furthermore, my last mirror was glass, which left a fine mess when it fell from its hook and shattered on the shower floor. I was concerned about attachment to the shower wall, which is a non-smooth stone surface. I installed it according to the  instructions and it has been in place, without a problem, ever since.&lt;br /&gt;I recently bought another one as a gift for one son and just ordered my third one for my other son.&lt;br /&gt;I think you can say that I am quite pleased with the product!</li>
    <li> This mirror really works!  If you fill it with the hot water at the beginning of the shower, it will not fog.  The trick is remembering to empty the water!</li>
    <li> If the plastic wasn&#x27;t so cheap I would argue that this was made by God...It&#x27;s amazing how well it works...Had it up for about 5 months now and have had no issues...</li>
    <li> Not much to say here. I wanted to shave in the shower using a mirror that would not fog up, and that is what I received. No complaints.</li>
    <li> the squeegee could be a little more sturdy, but after buying three other fogless mirrors for daily shower use, this is the only one that truly works, no frills, no gimmicks, no nonsense. really recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I love the clarity of the mirror in shower.&lt;br /&gt;My shaving just got that much easy!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> Not so good.&lt;br /&gt;For the money the size of the mirror can be more.&lt;br /&gt;The mirror should increase&lt;br /&gt;I put three.</li>
    <li> Been using this mirror for 14 months now. Great product and true to its word.  This shower mirror does not fog when hot water put into it, no matter how long of a shower I take.  Highly recommend!  I also like how the squeegee can be tucked underneath in the holder...clever design!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down side for me is that I am in a temp place for a few months and when I go to move to my permanent home, I am not sure how I will get the mirror out of the shower, as the directions for installation did not include removal instructions.  Not a huge deal right now, but I will need to get that mirror off the tile at some point and hoping it is not difficult to do.  Not a knock on this product, so I would not count this as a negative by any means.  But, as a suggestion to the manufacturer, maybe some helpful hints/directions on how to remove the adhesive should be included for removal going forward with this product.</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror!  Works just as advertised, no fog what-so-ever when used in a hot shower!  I would have given this 5-stars, if the mirror was a little larger, but other than the actual mirror&#x27;s size I have NO complaints.  I think the model with built-in lights has a large mirror, but the last thing I need at my house is another item requiring batteries.</li>
    <li> The first Mirror that actually works as promised never fogs and always clear.&lt;br /&gt;easy to keep clean only suggestion is to add  lights to it..</li>
