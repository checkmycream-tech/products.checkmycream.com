    <li> I originally bought this product at the local grocery store, but it is no longer available there.  I feel I paid too much for this product online but I was ordering other products and decided to add this to the order.  I really think this product gives me the best shave that I have ever had. Currently, I am using Neutrogena gel and I like this product better.  Also, a little bit goes a long way - applying a small nickel-sized portion is sufficient.  I am not bald, so I only use this product on my face.  I lather up and shave the first time with the grain of my whiskers.  Then, I wet my face without a second application of the product and shave against the grain. The product lasts through both stages of the shave. The gel is very lubricating and has a pleasant smell.  I don&#x27;t know why it is so hard to find -perhaps it is not being manufactured anymore.  That would be a shame - I really like this product.</li>
    <li> Amazon.com com selling this product for almost 100% more than at retail stores is a rip-off!  The product is great!  Buy it at Wal-Greens instead!</li>
    <li> I normally shave in the shower and Bald Guyz shave gel works well. Until the moisture and splatter of the shower caused a lot of it to slide off. The alternative to make it work is to take a \\&quot;Navy Shower\\&quot; where you first get wet, turn off the water and then soap up. That&#x27;s when you&#x27;d use this and shave. Following the seaborne men, then you turn the water on-briefly-and rinse off. It works perfectly if applied while standing over a basin with a pre-moistened head. Great glide, easily rinsed from the blade and leaves a smooth, fresh smelling head. I normally use baby oil which provides superior slipperiness but is a mess to rinse completely. This may well replace that save on \\&quot;special occasions\\&quot; when I want the slickest result possible. So why not the fifth star? It comes down to the fact that the product doesn&#x27;t adhere for as long as needed. Also, the gel is supposed to turn into a heavy foam which doesn&#x27;t quite happen. Good product, just not as good as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
    <li> Great product. .fast shipping</li>
    <li> Makes shaving my face and head easy with no cuts or razor rash and I no longer get pimples from shaving my head.</li>
    <li> This is an OK product, but I prefer HeadLube from HeadBlade.  Check out their head razors, too.  They have a full array of head shaving products, and I have tried them all, and they are all very good.  Check their website - their products can be hard to find.  I did find my first head blade razor at a local CVS.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my head with a razor for many years now and have tried many different products, this stuff is amazing!  Love it!</li>
    <li> The best stuff ever for tender skin. Sometimes it is hard to find. Just several drops will lather up. You&#x27;ll never want anything else again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been balding since the age of 19. So I have tired all types of shave gels/creams to shave my head. Hands down this product is the best! It offers a close shave with out the irritation or razor bumps. Of course you still need to be careful shaving your scalp! I have been using it for years along with the shampoo. Trust me on this!</li>
    <li> I switched to clear shave gell a number of years ago.  I couldn&#x27;t find locally so I ordered it online.</li>
    <li> Great Quality, as expected.</li>
    <li> Bald Guyz Shave Gel is fantastic! Best shave, no nicks, easy glide. I hate that it is so hard to find.</li>
    <li> I recently tried this and though it does not have that slightly tingly feel like the product I was using it is very slick and gets a very close shave.  That coupled with the lower price point is 5 stars in my book! This will be the product I will daily use to shave my head until I find something better...though I&#x27;m not sure I will.  I&#x27;ve tried a great many shaving products and this is just a solid shave gel.  I&#x27;ll admit though that I&#x27;m not a fan of cremes, I tried I just don&#x27;t like the way they gum the razor.</li>
    <li> Beats magic cream hands down.  I first bought this on a clearance shelf at Krogers and was unable to find it in a store near me.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t shave without it. Makes shaving my head and face an easy task. I have a beard, and having a shave gel that is clear really makes shaving around a beard very easy.</li>
    <li> Works like it says and don&#x27;t need to use that much at all.the price was a little steep seeing after bought on here seen at local drug store for more then 60 percent less then I paid but all in all I like it</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!! I&#x27;m not bald, nor am i a man, but I have very sensitive skin along my bikini line and this stuff NEVER gives me razor rash!!!! I hate that it&#x27;s so hard to find, but glad its on Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> Great product ..refreshing shave .Works very well on head and face..I would definitely recommend  this product...</li>
    <li> After using this product it made my hair grow back faster. Did not appreciate that at all (LOL). I can&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Bald Guyz makes great products for bald men.  This shave gel is very good.  Not messy and helps to generate a cleaner shave.  Just mix with a little water.</li>
