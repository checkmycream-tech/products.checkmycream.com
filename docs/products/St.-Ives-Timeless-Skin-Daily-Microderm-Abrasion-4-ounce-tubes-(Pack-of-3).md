      <li>I love it!!</li>
      <li>I love this cleanser!!  </li>
      <li>It does a good job.</li>
      <li>so i thought any kind of exfoliation was out and forget about microdermabrasion right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I prefer this one over the others because the abrasives are very fine and evenly distributed.</li>
      <li>Thought I was buying a supply of the original which I loved, got this instead.</li>
      <li>that do nothing more.  </li>
      <li>I used to be able to find this.  </li>
      <li>I really love this exfoliater.</li>
      <li>Its more of just a cleaner.</li>
      <li>This sweeps all the debris away without irritation letting the products work better.</li>
      <li>This is the best facial scrub ever!</li>
      <li>A fairly refined grittiness, but just enough to be effective.  </li>
      <li>Like a light micodermabrasion that won&#x27;t irritae your skin.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t seen this available for a while</li>
      <li>Bought 3 pack  - two times now - great for daily use as it contains real microdermabrasion crystals.  </li>
      <li>I am almost 36 years old, and I am so pleased with how my skin is looking.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely worth the money, i keep one in my shower, on my vanity and one in my gym bag.</li>
      <li>Worth the money.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried the apricot scrub from St. Ives as well - and the original formula works great but is hard to find.</li>
      <li>My skin fresh out of the shower still leaves much to be desired in terms of feeling clean and exfoilated.</li>
      <li>I liked both, but this one can really be used daily.</li>
      <li>After finishing my first tube of the Timeless Skin microderm-abrasion, I couldn&#x27;t find it in any store (and couldn&#x27;t remember where I purchased it from in the first place!)....searched online and, of course, Amazon had it.</li>
      <li>I plan to keep using this product and will definitely order more.</li>
      <li>I love the daily microdermabrasion.</li>
      <li>Now, I only find products much more costly  </li>
      <li>I tried this and while it&#x27;s OK, definitely does not \\&quot;scrub\\&quot; the skin.  </li>
      <li>I love this face wash/scrub because it is definitely not too rough to use everyday, and leaves your face feeling so clean and great.</li>
      <li>Easy to use daily - helps skin texture</li>
      <li>You really can use this every day.</li>
      <li>I was using Philosophys Microdermabrasion Scrub which is VERY PRICEY.</li>
      <li>Also, this product can be drying, even though it is fairly gentle, so I don&#x27;t recommend using it every day as indicated.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really unclog pores as well as I was expecting.</li>
      <li>This product replaces the original St. Ives microdermabasion scrub introduced last years to raves.</li>
      <li>this little bottle -though fairly expensive at $7 IMO- is filled with wonderful stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>gentle enough (for me) to use every day and leaves my skin soft, smooth, and glowing just like</li>
      <li>I think that this works better and feels a lot less abrasive.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s mild enough to use every day and my skin isn&#x27;t as oily when I use it.</li>
      <li>The new product version was considerably different than the original formula and nowhere near the quality.</li>
      <li>I have used several different scrubs through out the years, this one is by far my favorite.</li>
      <li>I put sunscreen on right after washing with the St. Ives and at night I use Burt&#x27;s Bees deep cleansing (with chamomile) and Roc night cream with Retinol in it along with an eye cream also by Roc.  </li>
      <li>this product in stores around where I live.  </li>
      <li>So far I think this is working for me!</li>
      <li>like you&#x27;re using sand paper on your face, nor was it too soft to where it felt like it was doing nothing for you.</li>
      <li>/&gt;it was worth the money spent.</li>
      <li>i wet my face, use a dollop about the size of a pea, gently scrub and then rinse away those old</li>
      <li>Better off discontinuing the product than to leave the new formula on market, unfortunately.</li>
      <li>I use it every day in the mornings, and my sebum levels are less, and my skin is brighter looking ; )  </li>
      <li>i have very dry very sensitive skin</li>

    <li> I love this cleanser!!  I use it every day in the mornings, and my sebum levels are less, and my skin is brighter looking ; )  I am almost 36 years old, and I am so pleased with how my skin is looking.  I put sunscreen on right after washing with the St. Ives and at night I use Burt&#x27;s Bees deep cleansing (with chamomile) and Roc night cream with Retinol in it along with an eye cream also by Roc.  So far I think this is working for me!</li>
    <li> Ordered product from Amazon since St Ives discontinued the product. The new product version was considerably different than the original formula and nowhere near the quality. Better off discontinuing the product than to leave the new formula on market, unfortunately.</li>
    <li> i have very dry very sensitive skin so i thought any kind of exfoliation was out and forget about microdermabrasion right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;wrong! this little bottle -though fairly expensive at $7 IMO- is filled with wonderful stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for use: i wet my face, use a dollop about the size of a pea, gently scrub and then rinse away those old dull cells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the dermabrasion element it contains is not sharp, irritating, drying, oily, or difficult to rinse away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s gentle enough (for me) to use every day and leaves my skin soft, smooth, and glowing just like it said it would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it was worth the money spent.</li>
    <li> I really love this exfoliater. I use it twice a week in the shower.  It works well without damaging or drying my skin.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really unclog pores as well as I was expecting. Also, this product can be drying, even though it is fairly gentle, so I don&#x27;t recommend using it every day as indicated.</li>
    <li> This is the best facial scrub ever! It works wonders. I have used several different scrubs through out the years, this one is by far my favorite. I was using Philosophys Microdermabrasion Scrub which is VERY PRICEY. I would choose St. Ives over it any day! Even if I had to pay what I was paying for Philosophy! Try this and you won&#x27;t want to use any over scrub! It&#x27;s not too grainy to where it feels like you&#x27;re using sand paper on your face, nor was it too soft to where it felt like it was doing nothing for you.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I would quite call it a microderm abrasion but it does make your skin feel and look great.  It&#x27;s mild enough to use every day and my skin isn&#x27;t as oily when I use it.</li>
    <li> I love the daily microdermabrasion. I bought it before and when I heard it was supposed to be discontinued I decided to stock up. It is a great product. I hope to find something similar before my supply runs out.</li>
    <li> This product replaces the original St. Ives microdermabasion scrub introduced last years to raves. Don&#x27;t know why they had to change so soon. Thought I was buying a supply of the original which I loved, got this instead. It does a good job. I use lots of products with acids in them as I have oily skin and am starting to age. This sweeps all the debris away without irritation letting the products work better. You really can use this every day.</li>
    <li> I used to be able to find this.  Now, I only find products much more costly  that do nothing more.  You will like this!</li>
    <li> This is just the right texture for cleaning and exfoliating skin without scratching or irritating. I use Retin-A and this takes care of the flaky skin. I have sensitive skin and this never makes me break out or have any other reaction. My teenaged daughter loves it too - makes pores appear smaller and gets rid of blackheads.Great price, too. I haven&#x27;t seen this available for a while - I hope they bring it back.</li>
    <li> After finishing my first tube of the Timeless Skin microderm-abrasion, I couldn&#x27;t find it in any store (and couldn&#x27;t remember where I purchased it from in the first place!)....searched online and, of course, Amazon had it. And for a great price.    I love this face wash/scrub because it is definitely not too rough to use everyday, and leaves your face feeling so clean and great. It doesn&#x27;t have any perfume smell, either. Plus you only need to use a very small amount so it lasts quite a while. I bought two of the 3-packs since I had such a hard time finding it in stores.</li>
    <li> I have very oily acne prone skin and was looking for a less expensive scrub to replace Pernox, which is really great, but expensive.  I tried this and while it&#x27;s OK, definitely does not \\&quot;scrub\\&quot; the skin.  Its more of just a cleaner.</li>
    <li> It was very difficult fin ding this product in stores around where I live.  It&#x27;s an excellent product for your face.  Like a light micodermabrasion that won&#x27;t irritae your skin.  Can  be used everyday and makes yur skin feel sooth and soft.  I love it!!</li>
    <li> A fairly refined grittiness, but just enough to be effective.  I would recommend this product.  No particular smell or oiliness issues.  .</li>
    <li> Easy to use daily - helps skin texture &amp; I use it on my hands too.  Not available in my local stores....</li>
    <li> Bought 3 pack  - two times now - great for daily use as it contains real microdermabrasion crystals.  I also you Olay Pro-x Plus with it sometimes.  Saves a fortune in botox</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this cleanser one time with noticeable results. My skin fresh out of the shower still leaves much to be desired in terms of feeling clean and exfoilated. I&#x27;ve tried the apricot scrub from St. Ives as well - and the original formula works great but is hard to find. I think that this works better and feels a lot less abrasive. It got rid of dry flaky patches I&#x27;ve been battling with for quite a while. I plan to keep using this product and will definitely order more.</li>
    <li> I bought these after using olay night scrub. I liked both, but this one can really be used daily. I bought this pack which has 3 tubes. Absolutely worth the money, i keep one in my shower, on my vanity and one in my gym bag. Its 4 oz, so can be carried on the flight. Also, i got the same item as in the picture. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> I wonder why I cannot find this at my local stores. I use it every-other day and I can see the great difference in my pores.</li>
    <li> I prefer this one over the others because the abrasives are very fine and evenly distributed. I used to use Clinique, but I didn&#x27;t always like the \\&quot;cooling\\&quot; effect of theirs. I also prefer the microfine abrasion for my face. The larger abrasives seem rough and inconsistent.</li>
