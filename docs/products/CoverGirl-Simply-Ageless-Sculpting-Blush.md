      <li>the color is nice</li>
      <li>It was so nice to find this discontinued blush.  </li>
      <li>So I was so thrilled to find it here</li>
      <li>I love this blush.  </li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t the color I ordered, but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>but I paid more for the product than I should have.  </li>
      <li>Love the color.</li>
      <li>It works better for me than a brush-on blush.</li>
      <li>love the product but it came in a foundation package and looked used.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other products but this one works best for me.</li>
      <li>While I love the original product, this appears to be an item that &amp;#34;couldn&#x27;t make the grade&amp;#34; for retail.  </li>
      <li>goes on so easily and stays on all day.</li>
      <li>Since this has apparently been discontinued in stores, I was happy to find it on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>I have ivory toned skin &amp; dark hair, this color is perfect for me.</li>
      <li>Like others, I am a Bzzz Agent and got to try this for free.  </li>
      <li>this bulky box won&#x27;t fit my cosmetic bag.</li>
      <li>For a low price, this blush was wonderful, and outperformed blush that I&#x27;ve spent three times more for.</li>
      <li>I had actually been eyeballing it at the store for a while and was thrilled when I got to try it out.</li>
      <li>This blush goes on evenly, stays fresh looking.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is highly pigmented -- easy to wind up looking like Baby Jane.  </li>
      <li>but when you run your finger across it the blend isn&#x27;t right and/or consistant.  </li>
      <li>The color isn&#x27;t as dark as it looks like it would be, which is good.  </li>
      <li>I can say I am pretty happy with this blush, though I was surprised that Cinnamon color 210 looks very natural on me as I usually tend to use more pinkish hues.</li>
      <li>Im planning to order more in the future.</li>
      <li>I tried a different shade, however, and was pleased.</li>
      <li>Love this product especially for &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; skin!</li>
      <li>that I ordered two of them to make sure I had enough for a year or two .It  </li>
      <li>I will most likely repurchase.</li>
      <li>Glad I was able to purchase 2; it will last me a long time.</li>
      <li>once you touched your cheek with it, it didn&#x27;t spread very well leaving one spot that was much darker than the rest.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s too much.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Color is VERY BERRY.</li>
      <li>I absolutely adore the Revlon&#x27;s cream blush and minimum packaging they use.</li>
      <li>It is a very natural looking blush that says on very well.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>The color is buildable so I can use a little for day/work and add more for evening.</li>
      <li>I am older &amp; it looks very natural on me.  </li>
      <li>Considering how little I&#x27;ve used with each application, I am expecting this to last a very long time, which makes it a great value for the price.</li>
      <li>Just have to get used to using it in small amounts but it does come off easily if you happen to use a bit too much.</li>
      <li>Love this product; not sure why it was discontinued.  </li>
      <li>it gives a natural blush with staying power.  </li>
      <li>I bought this directly from Amazon.  </li>
      <li>The blush is smooth and  silky but not greasy or oily and does not concentrate on uneven skin.</li>
      <li>Goes on creamy and looks natural.</li>
      <li>So far I like this</li>
      <li>Color is a little more vibrant than I would like, but it&#x27;s easy to just use a little less!</li>
      <li>I recommend this product for older women 40 above.  </li>

<li> The strange thing is that manufacturers still think we are dumb.</li>
<li> But the packaging is disappointing, very bulky, excess of transparent plastic around the actual plate with the product,  the sponge is useless and flimsy and I would prefer to have a mirror on the lid than this useless oversized sponge compartment.</li>
<li> was disappointed in this product.  </li>
<li> I have used this product for a couple years and was so disappointed when Cover Girl quit making it.</li>
<li> My son saw that I was very disappointed.  </li>

    <li> This blush goes on evenly, stays fresh looking.  It is the best blush I have ever used.  Love the color.</li>
    <li> Fabulous!! Love my cream blush!!</li>
    <li> I bought this directly from Amazon.  I like the product but I paid more for the product than I should have.  Walmart sells the same product in different colors for less money in their stores.</li>
    <li> Again, I like this product.</li>
    <li> It was so nice to find this discontinued blush.  I was so bummed that they quit making a great product.</li>
    <li> Like others, I am a Bzzz Agent and got to try this for free.  I had actually been eyeballing it at the store for a while and was thrilled when I got to try it out. I have ivory toned skin &amp; dark hair, this color is perfect for me. The color is buildable so I can use a little for day/work and add more for evening. I am a novice at using cream blush, I&#x27;ve used powder for years. So far I like this, it takes a little practice for beginners like me, but not hard to get the hang of at all. Considering how little I&#x27;ve used with each application, I am expecting this to last a very long time, which makes it a great value for the price. I will most likely repurchase.</li>
    <li> was disappointed in this product.  the color is nice but when you run your finger across it the blend isn&#x27;t right and/or consistant.  once you touched your cheek with it, it didn&#x27;t spread very well leaving one spot that was much darker than the rest.</li>
    <li> While I love the original product, this appears to be an item that &amp;#34;couldn&#x27;t make the grade&amp;#34; for retail.  That comment is strictly about the appearance of the product. I purchased two of them and they both have similar appearance.  However, it still works like what I bought at retail stores (and can no longer find at retail locations).</li>
    <li> Loved this product. Hope it is sold again</li>
    <li> love the product but it came in a foundation package and looked used.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find this item. It has been discontinued by CoverGirl, although I don&#x27;t know why. So I bought 3 of the same. I don&#x27;t want to run out. It&#x27;s the best blush I&#x27;ve ever had. Thanks</li>
    <li> I use this product on a daily basis, I used liquid and powder blush, and it leaves my complexion in a poor taste.  This product leaves my complextion looking youthful it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.  I recommend this product for older women 40 above.  It met my expections 100% percent.  I&#x27;ve been looking for this product for 6 months driving to 6 targets, 5 pharmacies, and it wasn&#x27;t on their  shelves.  My son saw that I was very disappointed.  He decided to order it through Amazon, and thank god he found it.  Thank you Amazon.  It&#x27;s a great product, Im planning to order more in the future.</li>
    <li> Color is VERY BERRY. I have dark hair &amp; dark complexion but it&#x27;s too much. Prob best on someone of color.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find this product in our local stores anymore.  it gives a natural blush with staying power.  I&#x27;ve tried other products but this one works best for me.</li>
    <li> I love this blush.  The color isn&#x27;t as dark as it looks like it would be, which is good.  It&#x27;s a beautiful flush color on my olive skin.  It is creamy, but not greasy.  I am older &amp; it looks very natural on me.  I highly recommend it.</li>

    <li> CoverGirl took this blush off the market, so  I bought 2 on amazon.com.  It is a very natural looking blush that says on very well.</li>
    <li> Great product for a really good price. Goes on creamy and looks natural.</li>
    <li> This product has been discontinued by the company, but I like it, &amp; was looking for way to continue using it.  It works better for me than a brush-on blush.</li>
    <li> Since this has apparently been discontinued in stores, I was happy to find it on Amazon.  Color is a little more vibrant than I would like, but it&#x27;s easy to just use a little less!</li>
    <li> Way too &amp;#34;berry&amp;#34; for me.  This stuff is highly pigmented -- easy to wind up looking like Baby Jane.  I tried a different shade, however, and was pleased.</li>
    <li> Love this product; not sure why it was discontinued.  Glad I was able to purchase 2; it will last me a long time.</li>
    <li> Love this product especially for &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; skin! I hope it is never discontinued!</li>
