      <li>hands down, this is the best soap we&#x27;ve used.</li>

      <li>The Goats Milk Soap I enjoy and will purchase again.  </li>

      <li>I like both the original and lavender.</li>

      <li>I love this soap, and I would really appreciate it if Amazon would keep it in stock!</li>

      <li>this is my own personal tastes, nothing against the brand.</li>
      <li>It moisturizes and feels silky soft and smells lovely.</li>
      <li>but this is pretty mild.  </li>
      <li>Smells great, was a little strong for my sensitive skin though.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I first purchased this at the Vermont Country Store when we visited a couple of summers ago and have been looking for it ever since.</li>
    <li> Smells great, non irritating and it&#x27;s great to use!</li>
    <li> I personally believe this soap needs to be sold in every store in our country.&lt;br /&gt;I love it and it has helped me with my skin issues and with the psoriasis.</li>
    <li> This products is great. You won&#x27;t believe how soft it makes your skin. You will love the Lavender scent. I ordered it on the plan they send out every 2 months. I am so happy I did that. If I hadn&#x27;t i would have had to change it. I think I am hooked.</li>
    <li> Nicely lathering soap, with a very light lavender scent. It feels delightfully soothing on your skin, too.  However, it is not a hard-milled soap like the original Canus Goat&#x27;s Milk soap. I was a bit surprised about that.  I&#x27;m using it sparingly, but it probably won&#x27;t last long enough to justify the price of each bar. I&#x27;m very disappointed that Amazon no longer offers the multi-packs of the original Canus soap. I bought a large multi-pack before, of at least 8 bars, and at a very good price with free prime delivery. Unfortunately, that is no longer offered.</li>
    <li> This has worked miracles for me on my Psoriasis.  The scaling has gone away almost entirely, only leaving slight signs of where it was.  I have taken so many different medication for years and some has had bad side effects.  I have seen many Doctors and Dermatologist with little improvement.  It is so amazing something so simple and natural is the answer.</li>
    <li> If you cannot use products with coconut oil, which I can&#x27;t, then use this.  I was ordering another soap from Amazon but they apparently had problems getting it in, so I found this.  I actually prefer this one!  Because I&#x27;m allergic to coconut oil (and apparently coconut in any form), I can&#x27;t use most soaps nor shampoos, and it&#x27;s a problem finding any I can.  I also have very sensitive skin.  This is a nice soap which doesn&#x27;t cause any problems nor irritation, and the bar, because it&#x27;s a larger one, lasts longer than an average one, which is helpful.  I love this soap, and I would really appreciate it if Amazon would keep it in stock!</li>
    <li> this is best soap that I have found for your bath or shower--keeps the skin soft and hydrated</li>
    <li> I am a very long time user of [[ASIN:B005HO0AR2 Dove Bar Soap, Sensitive Skin, 16 Count]] from Costco and I always liked it&#x27;s feel. I was little skeptical when I got the soap , which I found only online. It is also fairly pricey by Soap standards. Upon receiving I noticed it is much bigger than a Dove soap (About 1.5 Dove Soap makes this one). This soap is certainly far superior to Dove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It is not as squishy as a Dove Soap, a factor I never liked.&lt;br /&gt;2. It is much more smoother.&lt;br /&gt;3. The Fragrance is subtle and clearly you can feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is unlikely I move out of my long term brand Dove, but this is certainly far better product.</li>
    <li> Smells sooo good, great price &amp; big size bar which lasts. Lavender is so natural smelling &amp; fresh!</li>
    <li> Smells great, was a little strong for my sensitive skin though. I purchased this as an add-on to give it a try, ended up purchasing gentler soap from a goat farm.</li>
    <li> I like the soap and I like the ingredients, as well. I most likely will order more when needed since I am not only concerned about what I am putting into my body, but what I use on my body also.</li>
    <li> Love this soap, lather is silky on my very dry skin. Visible improvement to skin texture after using this!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good but if you have sensitive hands the sea buckthorn soap is the least aggravating to the skin.</li>
    <li> Bought this soap as a gift for my girl. She loves lavender and we both love the Canus products. She loves lavender scents and I was glad to have found lavender scented Canus soap.</li>
    <li> Canus Vermont Goat&#x27;s Milk Soap is wonderful for all types of skin. Never have I had my skin feel so clean and soft from any other product I have ever used. A friend had bought a case of the soap and gave me a bar to try. Needless to say,I was &amp;#34;sold&amp;#34; after using it the first time. I like both the original and lavender. I will be a Canus Goat Milk Soap user from now on.</li>
    <li> Great product! Love goats milk soap!</li>
    <li> It is a very nice soap.  I like the smell and the feel as well.</li>
    <li> The Goats Milk Soap I enjoy and will purchase again.  However, I will steer clear of the lavender, and stick with the traditional.  this is my own personal tastes, nothing against the brand.</li>
    <li> hands down, this is the best soap we&#x27;ve used. my daughter, who has extremely sensitive skin, uses nothing else. it moisturizes, smells delightful, and cleans without irritations.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this soap! I have extremely dry skin, and this soap helps alleviate that. Not much of a fragrance, which is great too.</li>
    <li> I LOVE GOAT MILK SOAP B/C IT LEAVES YOUR SKIN FEELING REALLY HYDRATED AND SMELLING WONDERFUL. GOATS MILK SOAP IS A WONDERFUL PRODUCT AND I LOVE LAVENDER ALWAYS.</li>
    <li> Love the way this fills on my skin and like the smell! Good value.</li>
    <li> Love this soap,always have, always will.What else can I say but buy it if you love lavender and want a gentle soft non drying soap made perfect.</li>
    <li> My grandson has very dry skin , this soap is natural and helps his skin.</li>
    <li> I wanted a totally non-toxic soap. I eat organic and wanted the same for all my other household products. This soap disappointingly had potassium sorbate and tetrasodium EDTA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are better soaps out there, if you&#x27;re looking for 100% non-toxic. The Environmental Working Group has a fantastic database of skin and body products here: [...]</li>
    <li> Body washes are wasteful and expensive--they are, when you think of it--simply soap dissolved in water with a generous price tag. We can&#x27;t believe how long triple-milled bars last, and Canus is well-priced with a pleasant natural lavender fragrance. I recommends it!</li>
    <li> I like the fragrance, but found out the PH level is 10.  Thought this might be a good shampoo soap, but didn&#x27;t work out.  It does feel like a rich bathing soap so for that purpose its OK.  It doesn&#x27;t work for me, needed a gentler soap.</li>
    <li> YUM!!!  Silky and smells wonderful!!! No residue and even squeaky soft skin!!!</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! I was looking for something that smelled good as well as lathered well. This product has both! I can honestly say that my skin is even softer after a few weeks of using this verses other soaps. It&#x27;s a great natural soap and I&#x27;ll be purchasing this from now on.</li>
    <li> I love this soap. It hydrates my skin well and smells great.</li>
    <li> Nice soap, smells wonderful and feels great on your face leaving it nice and clean.</li>
    <li> I know I&#x27;ll love this lovely soap in the shower where my skin can feel the benefits of the soothing goat&#x27;s milk and I can bask in the scent of lavender, but for now it graces my nightstand where I enjoy its fragrance!</li>
    <li> This soap leaves my skin moisturized which is nearly impossible with how dry my skin is. It does, however, sour on my skin. It is a reaction to some sort of chemical and I have not narrowed it down yet. I think I would give it 5 stars if it were all-natural. But if you don&#x27;t have skin sensitivities and are just looking for a great moisturizing soap, this is a very good product.</li>
    <li> I love this soap. smells great and works great. Love not having all the chemicals in the other brands of soap.</li>
    <li> Not Crabtree and Evelyn.....but very good for the price. Will buy again</li>
    <li> I really like this soap. The bar is pretty big and the scent is delicious</li>
    <li> Leaves your skin feeling smooth. It&#x27;s natural. The lavender smell is pleasant.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I have dry skin during the winter and the soap leaves my skin soft but not oily.</li>
    <li> this is really nice soap. It is a nice, solid, long lasting bar of soap with a very nice lather and scent of Lavender.  It&#x27;s not harsh and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out as bad as some other bar soaps I have used. I love it! I&#x27;m going to buy a different scent for my daughter because she isn&#x27;t fond of Lavender.</li>
    <li> highly recommend this soap, very good as health and beauty care.</li>
    <li> Divine! Creamy, great-smelling and non-drying and non-irritating. Love Canus&#x27;s goat&#x27;s milk products and this is agreat addition.</li>
    <li> Ordered this at the recommendation of a friend.  Glad I listened to him.  Nice emollient soap.  I chose the lavendar scent.</li>
    <li> It smells really good however it leaves my skin feeling dry. I will be looking for something with more moisturizing properties. Bar is good sized though and holds shape well.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this soap. I have been using it for many years</li>
    <li> Great product I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Nice soap. Light scent.</li>
    <li> This soap makes me feel clean but does not irritate my skin at all. I have been getting eczema for the last year and it is greatly improved when I use this soap. The fragrance is not strong which I like as well.</li>
    <li> great smell and texture</li>
    <li> I bought this because some people said it is good for acne and after my aunt use it she said it is very moist and not oily</li>
    <li> This is my alltime favorite lavender soap.  Feels great on my skin and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue...and has an amazing fresh lavender scent.</li>
    <li> I use to use this soap years ago and it help moisture. But now I find it quite drying. I am using the Dial Nutriskin White Peach and Shea Butter Soap instead and it is really good at moisturizing.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s awesome.  I like it.</li>
    <li> I love this goat&#x27;s milk soap I told my two daughters to buy it they too will love it...Makes your skin feel like silk :)</li>
    <li> Wow, Wow, Wow. This is some of the nicest smelling, high quality soap I have used in a long time. The lavender scent is magnificent and transports you to another space. The soap is very  very soft and makes my skin feel supple. I highly recommend this soap.</li>
    <li> It moisturizes and feels silky soft and smells lovely. Not at all like a goat (which was a minor concern when ordering this product). I love it and will reorder. Thank you for selling a great soap!!! It is perfect in all ways for my skiing, gently cleansing without drying, with a mild scent.</li>
    <li> Very nice bar of soap. The fragrance is so good and the bar was very hydrating and gentle on my dry skin.</li>
    <li> Great price for this great product.  I will definitely reorder.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like soaps with too much fragrance.  At first, I thought this would be too much for me, but since it rinses off well, it does not leave too much lingering fragrance on my skin.  I&#x27;ve already repurchased this item.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t smell that great</li>
    <li> My wife was delighted with it.</li>
    <li> I love this soap.  It smells wonderful when I use it in the shower and makes my skin feel so soft. I have&lt;br /&gt;sensitive skin and suffer from eczema at times and this soap really feels great when I use it.</li>
    <li> not a fan of fragrances in things but this is pretty mild.  Having used the unscented for a while thought I would try this.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really have a scent, which I like.  It gets me clean and doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation.  I have REALLY sensitive skin and tend to get rashes easily from soaps or lotions.  I&#x27;m happy with it because I haven&#x27;t had any negative reactions at all and it&#x27;s not too expensive.</li>
    <li> Delicate, cleans well..I love it!</li>
