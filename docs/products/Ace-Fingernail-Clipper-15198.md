      <li>He loved it.</li>
      <li>Good cutters.</li>
      <li>They look neat and feel good in your hand however they don&#x27;t cut quite as nice.</li>

      <li>Cuts great clipper design makes any nail easy to trim.</li>
      <li>Clipper looks nicely and is well built.</li>
      <li>I carry them in my get home bag and they have come in handy.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re well made and do the job nicely.</li>
      <li>and I think if someone with a brain they could make the leverage handle to cut better.</li>
      <li>/&gt;would have no problem buying more for friends.</li>
      <li>My husband borrowed an ACE fingernail clipper on a trip and he loved it so much we ordered one as soon as we got home!</li>
      <li>Pretty nice.</li>
      <li>Nothing special like they claim.</li>
      <li>Easy to hold, sharp and good design.</li>
      <li>Strong, doesn&#x27;t flex, and the rubber clippings catcher largely works.</li>
      <li>Still better than the classic, tiny, cheap clippers</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t lose it and needs little pressure to get good results.</li>
      <li>Looks nice but the Quality is not more than a cheap nail cutter.</li>
      <li>In person these look more like the jaws of life than a personal grooming tool.</li>
      <li>Way too big, more of what I would expect for toe nail clippers.</li>
      <li>Actually, the cheapo ones work better.</li>
      <li>I was able to get through one hand before I swore them off and went back to a drug store clipper to finish the job.</li>
      <li>The flat toenail one is better since you don&#x27;t have to worry about ingrown nails.</li>
      <li>Nice and sharp.</li>

      <li>They seemed very sturdy.</li>
      <li>Very manly.</li>
      <li>I purchased these about a year ago, and they really really suck at the one thing they are supposed to do.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Inventor Ted With / legal Patten Numbers</li>
      <li>Very well built, they look awesome, and no more mess in my room on the floor with eagle talon leftovers.</li>
      <li>Why not just make the leverage, cut lever long and easy for old hands?</li>
      <li>but if they could work on this small engineering / styling complaint they would be perfect.</li>
      <li>They are just too big and bulky, can&#x27;t really curve around your finger nails without leaving something to file off.&lt;br</li>
      <li>These clippers are a bit bigger than your normal fingernail clippers.</li>
      <li>so your thumb automatically fits right in there and can push down.</li>
      <li>I like them much better than the tiny, super cheap clippers, but the thickness of both the upper and lower clipper portion do seem a bit too thick (sometimes it is actually a bit difficult to get your nail in between the clippers).</li>
      <li>and I generally don&#x27;t reach for these clippers.</li>

<li> and I generally don&#x27;t reach for these clippers.</li>
<li> They are a little awkward to use to cut nails short because they are huge (even for my size Large hands) and don&#x27;t fit between your nail and your finger as easily as a standard clipper because these have a tall cutting edge--you end up using it at a funny angle.  </li>

<li> I contemplated buying these due to cost and whether I actually needed a pair of &#x27;man&#x27; clippers.  </li>
<li> I had to force these under my fingernails at a backwards angle to cut them which left them sharp which made them catch on things.  </li>
<li> I think it was a little pricey for nail clippers, but it nicer than just getting generic drug store clippers.</li>
<li> Due to the difficulty of getting the blades on actual nail and fear of snipping my finger tip off my nails ended up chewed up (no clean cuts).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I thought these would be high quality, and they are, but poorly designed.</li>
<li> I will use them if I cant find the other pair though.</li>
<li> I am a man who keeps my fingernails short and these clippers are designed for people with longer fingernails that go past the end of the fingertip.  </li>
<li> The &amp;#34;face&amp;#34; of the clipper part where the blades come together is so huge it&#x27;s nearly impossible to get a finger nail in between to cut.</li>
<li> A little weird to use the first couple times just have to get used to them</li>
<li> Not worth for USD13 including shipping.</li>
<li> you have really big, thick nails, these are for you.</li>
<li> should be bent down</li>
<li> Large sort of bulky, cutting edge doesn&#x27;t line up</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t think it was going to be this heavy duty.</li>
<li> It is a little bit hard to use due to its thick head.</li>
<li> These trimmers are way too bulky, making it hard to feel what you are doing.&lt;br /&gt;Found them to be dull, leaving nail with a rough edge.</li>
<li> There is NO way to really control your movements or do any delicate cutting with these clippers.</li>
<li> The description needs to say that these are for fingernails that go past the and of your fingertip.</li>
<li> very heavy duty and precise&lt;br</li>
<li> Would like to return it, very difficult to handle, exstremely misleading photo, i thought it to be a lot bigger, please refund my paypal</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t hate these clippers enough.</li>
<li> /&gt;Again, I can&#x27;t hate these enough.</li>

    <li> These clippers are a bit bigger than your normal fingernail clippers. I carry them in my get home bag and they have come in handy. They&#x27;re well made and do the job nicely. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Quality clippers.  Should be the last pair I buy unless I lose them.</li>
    <li> These clippers look cool, are built tough and are quite sharp.  They are a little awkward to use to cut nails short because they are huge (even for my size Large hands) and don&#x27;t fit between your nail and your finger as easily as a standard clipper because these have a tall cutting edge--you end up using it at a funny angle.  I also miss the hook-shaped &#x27;file&#x27; that I use to scrape the gunk from under my nails.</li>
    <li> really loved the nail clipper, strong and easy to grip, but was disappointed when ordering the toe nail clipper, photo shows toe nail clipper but I got 2 fingernail clipper.</li>
    <li> I am a man who keeps my fingernails short and these clippers are designed for people with longer fingernails that go past the end of the fingertip.  I had to force these under my fingernails at a backwards angle to cut them which left them sharp which made them catch on things.  The description needs to say that these are for fingernails that go past the and of your fingertip.</li>
    <li> Easy to hold, sharp and good design. I carry it in my gym bag and on trips.  You can&#x27;t lose it and needs little pressure to get good results.</li>
    <li> Excellent men&#x27;s toenail clippers.</li>
    <li> Nice and sharp. Good cutters. probably one of the best nail cutters I have ever owned. However the nail catcher doesn&#x27;t work. and I think if someone with a brain they could make the leverage handle to cut better. Why not just make the leverage, cut lever long and easy for old hands? The ( Cut lever )  should be bent down so your thumb automatically fits right in there and can push down. Da.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise these are quality cutters. A note to the manufacture if you ever read this , Just design the bottom rubber nail catcher with a enough opening for the nails to fall in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inventor Ted With / legal Patten Numbers</li>
    <li> very heavy duty and precise&lt;br /&gt;would have no problem buying more for friends. you cant&lt;br /&gt;find these at your local wal mart</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think it was going to be this heavy duty. Heavy set of clippers but very durable. Cuts well!</li>
    <li> I like them much better than the tiny, super cheap clippers, but the thickness of both the upper and lower clipper portion do seem a bit too thick (sometimes it is actually a bit difficult to get your nail in between the clippers). Still better than the classic, tiny, cheap clippers but if they could work on this small engineering / styling complaint they would be perfect. Same with the Ace toenail clippers.</li>
    <li> Clipper looks nicely and is well built. It does the job but it does however require some getting use to using it because of the design.</li>
    <li> Unlike any clipper my family has ever used !Cuts great clipper design makes any nail easy to trim. My husband borrowed an ACE fingernail clipper on a trip and he loved it so much we ordered one as soon as we got home!</li>
    <li> I decided to make a grooming gift basket for my brother-in-law for Christmas. He loved it. This was one of the items I put in the basket. I think it was a little pricey for nail clippers, but it nicer than just getting generic drug store clippers. They seemed very sturdy.</li>
    <li> The nail clippers are exceptionally sturdy and work great. I bought them for my husband but it looks like I will have to buy him another set since I&#x27;m keeping them.</li>
    <li> Looks nice but the Quality is not more than a cheap nail cutter. Not worth for USD13 including shipping. Nothing special like they claim.</li>
    <li> It is a little bit hard to use due to its thick head.</li>
    <li> Would like to return it, very difficult to handle, exstremely misleading photo, i thought it to be a lot bigger, please refund my paypal</li>
    <li> I contemplated buying these due to cost and whether I actually needed a pair of &#x27;man&#x27; clippers.  Yes, yes I do.  These are incredible and I recommend you buy them right away!  Very well built, they look awesome, and no more mess in my room on the floor with eagle talon leftovers.</li>
    <li> These trimmers are way too bulky, making it hard to feel what you are doing.&lt;br /&gt;Found them to be dull, leaving nail with a rough edge. Would not order again.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t hate these clippers enough. In person these look more like the jaws of life than a personal grooming tool. The &amp;#34;face&amp;#34; of the clipper part where the blades come together is so huge it&#x27;s nearly impossible to get a finger nail in between to cut. There is NO way to really control your movements or do any delicate cutting with these clippers. I was able to get through one hand before I swore them off and went back to a drug store clipper to finish the job. Due to the difficulty of getting the blades on actual nail and fear of snipping my finger tip off my nails ended up chewed up (no clean cuts).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I can&#x27;t hate these enough. If it were possible to get a refund for just hating a product I would request one.</li>
    <li> Best clippers ever. Strong, doesn&#x27;t flex, and the rubber clippings catcher largely works. They will accumulate, just tap it over a trash can and they fall out. Pretty nice. The flat toenail one is better since you don&#x27;t have to worry about ingrown nails. Both are industrial strength man clippers. Built to last.</li>
    <li> Very manly. Ease of use. But the red rubber is a bother. The nails get  caught in it and I have to bang the clippers to get them out. Maybe it should be glued in?</li>
    <li> I purchased these about a year ago, and they really really suck at the one thing they are supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;The paint will come of after about a month of use. It does not function fetter in any way than the $1 you can pick up at a CVS or Walgreens. Actually, the cheapo ones work better.</li>
    <li> A little weird to use the first couple times just have to get used to them but I do like them</li>
    <li> Not what I was expecting. I thought these would be high quality, and they are, but poorly designed. Way too big, more of what I would expect for toe nail clippers. They are just too big and bulky, can&#x27;t really curve around your finger nails without leaving something to file off.&lt;br /&gt;If you have really big, thick nails, these are for you.</li>
    <li> Large sort of bulky, cutting edge doesn&#x27;t line up</li>
    <li> These were advertised as &amp;#34;man&amp;#34; clippers. They look neat and feel good in your hand however they don&#x27;t cut quite as nice. They don&#x27;t snap the nail off they just cut it and I generally don&#x27;t reach for these clippers. I will use them if I cant find the other pair though.</li>
