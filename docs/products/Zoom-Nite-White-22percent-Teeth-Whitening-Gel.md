<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Wife is a hygienist so she gets this product for a great price from work. It&#x27;s works noticeably after just a couple of uses</li>
    <li> Been using this product for quite some time and it works very well. I actually made my own teeth &amp;#34;trays&amp;#34; from athletic mouth guards. Simply add to boiling water, then form to your teeth. Start out using product slowing because it might &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; some people&#x27;s gums but you get use to it. I can leave it on for one hour.</li>
    <li> Excellent effectiveness. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Works like a champ.  I have Invisalign now so I bleach all the time.  May as well, since I have to wear the trays all the time anyway.</li>
    <li> The product does not work, Possibly expired.</li>
    <li> Shipped quick, good price, exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> I have always used Zoom to whiten my teeth. I always bought it from my dentist. Now it is so much easier to get through Amazon and a few dollars cheaper. It works really well.</li>
    <li> I have only used the product once, but it compares favorably with the other tooth whitening gels that I have used.</li>
    <li> Teeth are nice and white</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful. My dentist recommended it and I&#x27;ve gone from having discolored, yellowish teeth to about 5-6 shades brighter. I&#x27;m 66 years old with silver hair and my hair color made my teeth look even more yellow. My teeth aren&#x27;t quite where I want them to be yet but the improvement is amazing.</li>
    <li> Works great - just note there are little tips hidden in box. Didn&#x27;t see them first time and squirted to much out.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Less expensive than purchasing from the dentist.</li>
    <li> Excellent product,my wife uses this strength.  She says it&#x27;s better than the one she bought from her dentist (same product) only we suspect his wasn&#x27;t in code, and was more expensive.</li>
    <li> been using product for over 2 years and will to conitune to use this product.</li>
    <li> Have used it before....it does the trick!</li>
    <li> For many years I have suffered the embarrassment of tetracycline stained teeth. For the past several months, I have been using hydrogen peroxide as a mouthwash and unexpectedly noticed a slight improvement in tooth shade. As a result, I decided to investigate the myriad of peroxide based whitening products on Amazon. Having an affinity for the Phillips corporation, the choice was simplified. Commencing on 07/05, I began using the product daily with self forming trays for a full 2 hours. I trimmed them so they did not extend over the gumline. After the third treatment, I began to notice a subtle improvement in tooth shade. Subsequent treatments produced consistent and predictable improvements. After two weeks, I can now claim my teeth are indeed white. A dark band extending from the gumline to the upper quadrant of the teeth still remains however it has lightened considerably and I expect further improvements with future treatments. In the product description it is alleged that the gel formula reduces tooth sensitivity and restores a luster to the teeth. It has been my experience that both claims are true and accurate.I would have considered my condition severe and had little confidence I would see this much improvement in the first treatment cycle, if any at all. If you share the same considerations, I urge you to order the product and give it a try.</li>
    <li> I have REALLY white teeth!</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Great customer service!</li>
    <li> This is a great price compared to the price my dentist charges if I buy it in his office.  It has been very effective in keeping my teeth as white as my teeth will be.</li>
    <li> The gel expired in April 2013 and i received it in September 2013. That should not be allowed. Not happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this whitening cream regularly, and with great results. I did have an incident where I used too much and it turned my gums white (raw), but that was in the early stages of using this product. I used to buy it from my dentist, and I sm glad that I found less expensive on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;PS: Not for overnight use..!!</li>
    <li> Easy to apply.  Does exactly what I wanted.  Whitens teeth very good.  Good price and will order the same as soon as I run out.</li>
    <li> Much, much, much better than the batch we received before this one!</li>
    <li> Happy with the price. I did the zoom light treatment at a dental office, that&#x27;s the best way to get very white teeth. Then use the trays and zoom peroxide at home to maintain periodically.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT! I work for a dental office and saw that this the the brand my dentist use for her patient! so i decided to go home and search it up! I love how it&#x27;s SOOOOOOOOOOOOO much cheaper on amazon then having to actually buy it from the dental office. These are even cheaper than my crest 3D white strips and works just as well! i tried it out the moment i got it in the mail and after 2 hours my teeth were brighter and whiter! can&#x27;t wait to keep whitening it i hope it&#x27;ll get super white XD. i do experience some sensitivity but it&#x27;s not too bad. no pain no gain! lol</li>
    <li> Purchased this product when it was out of stock. Arrived promptly shortly after the back-in-stock date. Great price, much cheaper than buying from your Dentist. Works very well without making my teeth sensitive.</li>
    <li> Fantastic whitening gel!!  Item accurately described; fast shipment; Great Seller!  Thank You!!</li>
    <li> Taste nasty and even a little accidently getting on your gums hurts like hell.</li>
    <li> Perfect product for the right price</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t rate it 5 stars because it worked so well, worked fine. I have it five stars because it is exactly what you get from the dentist for a fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> I have done the zoom treatment at the dentist office before. That being said, zoom isnt exactly the cheapest procedure for whiter teeth. After getting a take home treatment from my dentist, I was advised that I could purchase this from third party vendors. I absolutely love this, it really works. If you received retainers and held on to them, it works just as great. I always advise my friends that I dont use weekly, instead monthly. Depending on the sensitivity level of your teeth, you will get zingers. For those not familiar with zingers, they are little spike/static shocks in your teeth that occur after the whitening process. This lasts maybe a half day to a day. There is special paste that can be purchased in the event you have zingers and it really does alleviate the shocks. Nonetheless, this is not uncommon. The product works great, and hope you all get great results.</li>
    <li> I have got it without Patented Formula Reduces Sensitivity???? and one of them was opened, why u did that; however, i bought 4 from u ???????????????&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need the Patented Formula Reduces Sensitivity</li>
    <li> This stuff works great ! It was recommended by my dentist so I knew it will work out with me..I applied it every other night for about 6 hours ,no pain, no gum irritaton , and it&#x27;s true 22% because I&#x27;ve tried the 35% I hardly saw any results and my gum were so irritated it was hard brushing my teeth the next day ..highly recommend this ..</li>
    <li> Noticed the difference after four uses</li>
    <li> paid $300 for a custom mood and 4 syringes at the dentist, paid less than $40 for 3 syringes, will be a repeat buyer</li>
    <li> I love zoom night it works really well on my teeth and it is price well also.I would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> It is too strong for me...I thought I was ordering the Zoom for night wear....it&#x27;s not the fault of the product just my sensitivity.  The overnight product is better for my life schedule.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Fast delivery</li>
    <li> Works well but does cause some sensitivity. Tecommend using the remineralization gel after. Helps a lot.</li>
    <li> Great product. Always get asked how my teeth are so white.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000K5YCBI Nite White Excel 3 ACP Z 22% Teeth Whitening 6pk Kit (Latest Product)]][[ASIN:B004M5LBNE NiteWhite ACP Bleaching Gel 22% 3 Pack]]    NiteWhite has not been discontinued, but is now a part of Phillips Oral Care and relabeled.    Philips Zoom NiteWhite and DayWhite deliver the superior results you want under the supervision of a dental professional. Whether you prefer to whiten while you sleep or the convenience of short daytime sessions, achieve your whitest smile in just one to two weeks.  [...]</li>
    <li> Thia product is wonderful!! First time I used it I already saw results....Reasonably priced and much cheaper then having teeth whitening at the dentist. Optimal results within two weeks which there is plenty in one order. Be sure not to use to much on application and avoid getting on gums as it can irritate them after a few treatments. The Remineralizing gel does help with irritation and teeth sensitivity Will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I applied this gel to the inside of my retainers and wore it for one hour on three different days in the same week.  I did notice a difference after the first day, but not as much as I had hoped for after three days.  I then used it again a few weeks later, but didn&#x27;t notice as much of a difference as I did after the first day.  Overall, I liked the product and I got better results than I had with drugstore whiteners.  The relief gel is a life saver and made the sensitivity diminish a lot!  I had less sensitivity with this product than I did with a similar product from the dentist.</li>
    <li> 2 nights using mouth tray and I get comments on my teeth being noticeably whiter.  I do this every few months so I feel the price is well spent since it works 100% after 2 uses - it stretches a long way.</li>
    <li> Works good but I prefer the others I reviewed better that are 38% and less expensive</li>
    <li> Almost as good as the stuff you get from the dentist</li>
    <li> I worked in a dental office that sold the exact same product for twice the price. This works great!</li>
    <li> awesome product, economical, a bit sensitive at first does not come with trays tho I used my retainers just use it and it works tho</li>
    <li> I have had the teeth whitening treatments at the dentist so i tried this along with the trays I still had from the dentist.  I didnt see a big difference. I wouldnt recommend this to anyone. I bought the crest 1 hour white strips and they are great and very reasonable on amazon!</li>
    <li> Works great!  I have ordered this before and will order it again.  It works great on my teeth as a whitener.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an inexpensive alternative to purchasing whitening product at the dentist office.  I found it!  This product is great and a good deal.  If you don&#x27;t have a mouth tray from the dentist then go to Walmart, buy a mouth guard, boil the mouth guard in a pot and once it cools shape it to your mouth/teeth.  This is a very affordable option for teeth whitening.</li>
    <li> I tried this Brand because I found the price affordable. I&#x27;ve whitening my teeth for 20 years.  I whiten for maintenance. The gel did a great job whitening after an hour of wearing the tray. I used this product on two consecutive days. I did notice a slight sensitive in my teeth. If you are whitening for the first time, and experience teeth sensitivity, I would recommend wearing the tray no longer than an hour. No need to whiten every day. Start out slowly, by whitening once or twice a week. Be patient, take your time and enjoy the results.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase of the Nite White 22%.  My first time using this product and I have to say, this is the best out of all the whitening products I&#x27;ve tried so far.  After one use (left on about an hour due to sensitive teeth) I noticed a huge difference in the shade of my teeth.  I can&#x27;t wait to do another application in a few days.  GREAT PRODUCT!! And the product expiration date was plainly listed on the packaging (and was not expired).</li>
    <li> After two weeks, under my dentist&#x27;s supervision, I became 11 shades whiter with this treatment.  After another week, I went to 13 shades whiter than before I began treatment.  My goal is 14 shades whiter but to a natural white, which I have now achieved.  I could not be happier with this product.  This amount is for six days use, if you follow directions.  My first two weeks, I got this product from my dentist and the third week I bought it here on Amazon, exactly the same product.</li>
    <li> The 22% is too strong.</li>
    <li> doesnt quite lift the color without constantly bleaching. At this rate it will be a lot of $$ before they get nice and white- after 3 tubes I would say my teeth are about 1 shade lighter.</li>
    <li> This product was exactly what I ordered. I paid the same price for 3 as I would have for one from my dentist! Awesome!</li>
    <li> Great Seller. Product as described.</li>
    <li> I like this stuff.  It works and has a very pleasant flavor.  Using it for maintenance and that means 2 or 3 times a week.</li>
    <li> Once a month to maintain whiteness is all it takes.  Makes teeth a little sensitive, but so do other brands.</li>
    <li> great and so much less expensive than buying through my dentist.</li>
    <li> Was exactly what I got from my dentist only less expensive.  But everything I hoped and expected it to be.  Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Not impressed at all! I bought the product about 15 years ago and it works great, but this time it didn&#x27;t work so well. I&#x27;m sure over the years the product has changed and definitely not for the better!</li>
    <li> My son had braces for 6 years. He&#x27;s teeth were pretty yellow. Teeth whitening can be very expensive. A family member told me about zoom. She was instructed by her orthodontist to put the zoom whitening in her retaining at bed time. I saw a big difference after the second day. I will be purchasing some for myself.</li>
    <li> Still experience tooth sensitivity after an hour or so.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a dream! I originally purchased the 10% strength with molded trays from my dentist for like $265. Then I found the 22% online (not from amazon) for a fraction of the price. I opted for the 22% because I wanted faster results. I was bleaching my bottom teeth only, in order to match the super white porcelain veneers I was having put on my top teeth. I did 3 or 4 nights of the 10% strength (which was supposed to be worn overnight due to the lower percentage), then when the 22% arrived in the mail, I wore it two days in a row for 2 hours each. Holy crap! When I went back to have the veneers applied, the dentist office couldn&#x27;t believe how white they&#x27;d gotten. My bottom teeth definitely match the veneers (which are the whitest shade veneers come in). I plan to use this every few months on the bottom as maintenance. I will say though, I naturally have very white teeth to start with, they had just darkened from coffee drinking, so this product removed all the staining and whitened my teeth noticeably. Your results will obviously depend on your natural tooth color, and eating/drinking habits etc. I now make a point to rinse my mouth with water after consuming things like tomato sauce or red wine, and I have given up coffee entirely just in case. I also use a whitening tooth paste to maintain the results.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know I had to use this overnight, haven&#x27;t tried it.  You must have a tray for your teeth, unlike the crest Whitner.</li>
    <li> Purchased this item at the dentist office several times.  It works and the price is great.  Thank you....will buy when needed</li>
    <li> This stuff works better than what I got from my Dentist. :) And I didn&#x27;t have to leave it in overnight, just a couple hours at a time was all it took. Very pleased,,,</li>
    <li> Works great, loved the price!</li>
    <li> 2nd time I&#x27;ve used this product and got great results.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that I could purchase &amp;#34;refills&amp;#34; after my original dentist-purchased pack. Works great! I was used to the 16% gel, and it is a bit stronger, so I had to use the sensitive toothpaste and skip days.</li>
    <li> it was awesome eeeeeeevvvver  eeevver bessst best best best  I recommend to buy it  and good and quick plus bouns</li>
    <li> I purchased these believing they were going to be just like the ones I&#x27;ve previously purchased from the dentist.  Though the packaging appears to be the same it definitely doesn&#x27;t carry the same strength.  I&#x27;m not sure if they are just old, or watered down but next time I&#x27;ll just spend more and purchase directly from my dentist.</li>
    <li> I have used whitener that worked faster, but it results in extreme tooth sensitivity.  This stuff is mild and does the job, even though it takes a bit more usage to get results.  Are my teeth glowing in the dark?  No, but they are a natural, clean, beautiful looking white which is what I want to maintain.  Very cost effective option to whitening especially if you have custom trays like I do.</li>
    <li> I drink a lot of coffee and my teeth sometimes can looked a bit stained.  I used this product three times, every other day in a week and got my teeth white.  I put just a bead for each tooth on the plastic mouth piece that the dentist gave me.  I was able to get three uses out of each tube.  Going to try twice a week then get down to once a week.  Still beats the price at the dentist office.</li>
    <li> I prefer ZOOM over all the other teeth whiteners. They also include a sensitivity tube. A little pricey for such a good product</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work.  I bought the real stuff from my dentist.</li>
    <li> This is the only teeth whitening solution I have ever used, so I have nothing to compare it to.  My dentist recommends this, and Amazon sells it for a fraction of the cost of other places.  The gel is highly effective when used overnight.  My teeth have a nice, natural color to them when I use this product every 3 months.  This gel has never caused me to have sensitive teeth, and my dentist told me that some of the whiteners will do just that.  Definitely recommend this product- easy to use, convenient to apply, and your teeth look fantastic after 3 nights.</li>
    <li> Love it. It works better than any other whitener</li>
    <li> Whitest teeth ever, my dentist charges $45 for the same whitener</li>
    <li> I got the product and the expiration date was already expired :/</li>
    <li> I usually use 15% CP whitening gel so I was excited to step it up a notch with 22%. I have semi-sensitive teeth but not to to point I can&#x27;t eat ice cream or drink hot coffee. I used this product overnight and my teeth are throbbing today so be careful! I don&#x27;t suggest the overnight as your first go around with this stuff. However, I got excellent results so it was worth sore teeth for a day. Hopefully it will only last for a day!</li>
    <li> Good product. Whitening was visible and the dispenser was very easy to use. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Replaced for my Zoom nite bites.</li>
    <li> This is the same stuff my dentist sells only a little stronger.  It is cheaper here.</li>
    <li> I noticed my teeth brightened the first time. It did not make my teeth sensitive to hot or cold. I love it</li>
    <li> 5-Star product, 1-star seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, about the seller. I almost returned this unopened because I couldn&#x27;t see any expiration date on the packaging. There was a rather large, white gummed label with a UPC code on the clear plastic package that I didn&#x27;t think the manufacturer would have applied. Turning the package over I could make out what looked like another, much smaller label, so I decided to see what was underneath the top one. Fingernails, tweezers, some swearing, and a bright light, and 5 minutes later I was able to peel just enough back to find what was clearly the manufacturer&#x27;s label with product codes AND the expiration date. They could have placed their own label easily without covering the manufacturer&#x27;s. Thus the SELLER EMPIRE DEPOT DELIBERATELY OBSCURED THE PRODUCT EXPIRATION DATE. They ought to be dinged by Amazon at minimum for this devious practice. Seller doesn&#x27;t know how long it might be in their inventory before shipping to customers, so they count on &amp;#34;out of sight, out of mind&amp;#34;, i.e., hide the expiry date, many buyers won&#x27;t even think about it, so they can sell product near or even beyond the shelf-life of the gel, ripping people off by selling whitener that won&#x27;t whiten their teeth. Don&#x27;t buy anything from this seller would be my advice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the head shaker moment - the whitener I got is still a year from expiration! Dope&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the whitener itself, I got exactly what I ordered and it was the OEM product from Discus Dental made for Phillips, as described. So I&#x27;ll keep and use it since I have had good results with Nite White in the past.</li>
    <li> My dentist has been charging me 3 times the price for years for exactly the same product!</li>
    <li> This stuff whitened my teeth even better than the stuff from the dentist. I wish you could cap it up as I don&#x27;t use a whole tube at a time, that is my only complaint</li>
    <li> My dentist charged $250.00 bucks for the trays and two of the gel pens.  They sale them for thirty bucks each in his off for touch ups and it&#x27;s the 16%.  This was basically a huge steal and I only needed one pen to touch up my teeth and let me just say that these are strong and work well.  I went back to order my system some and they are no longer available which sucks :(</li>
    <li> Previously had no problem using Opalescence from an Amazon seller.  Tried 22% Zoom NiteWhite from a seller named Capital Healthcare.  Didn&#x27;t do any whitening at all.  Instead it made a few of my teeth (only the surface that touched the gel) very sensitive.  I had no issues with any of my teeth prior to using this product.  I stopped using it about half way thru one order.  I doubt I will be buying any more teeth bleaching product from Amazon, only because I can&#x27;t tell which seller might have good products.  If sensitivity goes away, I will edit this review.</li>
    <li> This product works very well and as intended. Because of the higher percentage, I can only tolerate a few days in a row but I&#x27;ve also started using a sensitive toothpaste to help. I&#x27;ve been getting compliments on my whiter teeth.</li>
    <li> I bought from Empire Depot. I had custom trays that I bought off Amazon from Sporting Smiles. I highly recommend both. I was worried because of some reviews that reported it didn&#x27;t work. The first night I wore overnight and woke up in the middle of the night with pain. I have the blue remineralization gel and that always helps any tooth pain go away. After about 3-4 days of wearing for about 2-4 hours, I can tell my teeth are whiter. The pain goes away for me after wearing the trays once or twice.</li>
    <li> This whitening gel, when inserted into my Invisiline teeth trays, makes my teeth so bright the next day, that several people comment on how bright my teeth are, every time I use it.</li>
    <li> LoL&lt;br /&gt;Buy from your dentist for 4-5 times the price OR buy here.&lt;br /&gt;SAME STUFF, EXACTLY, just cheaper!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used. Three progressive sessions at 20 minutes a piece in the same day and I had a Hollywood smile. Love it</li>
    <li> I think this product whitens very well. There is still some sensitivity. But the amount of sensitivity is much less compared to other professional products.</li>
    <li> I have used this product after a dental cleaning, which I have been told is the best time to whiten teeth, and have been very pleased with the results.  I recommend this product highly!</li>
    <li> Great product, exactly what is offered by the Dentist at a much lower price.  Will be order I g from here going forward.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to be whitening my teeth.  I will try it again..............Thanks for asking.</li>
    <li> Works well, no irritation. Only issue is that I used it up a lot faster than I thought I would.</li>
    <li> It works, as advertised.</li>
    <li> They have almost doubled the price for this product in the last year.</li>
    <li> This is a good product my dentist recommends it her price is double the price here .</li>
    <li> The same brand cost me $187.00 at one dentist. Very happy! I will buy this through Amazon again when this package is finished.</li>
    <li> I guess I have sensitive teeth. The first time I used it, I did not use the sensitive relief tube. My teeth were very sensitive. The second time I used the sensitive relief gel and it made a huge difference.! The relief gel works miracles. However, there is only one tube, or enough for two applications. I would have preferred an even ratio since for sensitive teeth, both are necessary.</li>
    <li> after bleaching my teeth 2-3 times i started getting compliments on how white my teeth are, i never got any compliments on my teeth before so i think this is the only thing i need to say here since it&#x27;s not my opinion but feedback from people around me who noticed the difference. i am glad i tried! still not sure why it&#x27;s so cheap compare to the prices at the doctor&#x27;s office! wow.</li>
    <li> Works GREEAT!!!!  Will be ordering more soon!!</li>
    <li> Works great! I checked with my dentist first to see what strength he used in his office and he said 21%. I tend to have sensitive teeth but, this product was tolerable</li>
    <li> I use Zoom Nite White 22% whitening gel once/week for 2 hours and it is tough on stains, gentle on gums.</li>
    <li> Though I ordered it by mistake I will keep it for the future as I always like to keep this on hand.</li>
    <li> I like it cause it works.  It takes 1 hour to see a difference.  Id give it a 5 if it worked in less time.  Anything less than 22% doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
    <li> Low sensitivity issues.  This is a follow up to a professional Zoom whitening treatment.  Great value compared to the office proces and allows for at home use with the trays I got from my dentist.</li>
    <li> i could save up lots of money by doing it on my own at my house. although it was hard to find the perfect mouth tray to go with it. still love the quality and i&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now and it works!</li>
    <li> Arrived in a timely manner and works great!!!  I can see noticeable improvements in the whiteness of my smile and I am very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Wore it over night and had the Remineralization Gel as well (and thank god! because your teeth will hurt like a b**ch after using).</li>
    <li> Seems to work well, the same quality as what my dentist provided me after my Zoom treatment in his office. Very happy with this purchase and the price was great!</li>
    <li> So far so good. I used this as replacement gel as I already had professionally made molds. This was much less expensive than the same brand from the dentist office. Will definitely buy again when run low.</li>
    <li> Philips Zoom teeth whitening gel is the identical product I&#x27;ve purchased from my dental office, but at a significantly reduced price.  When it runs out I will buy it again through Amazon.</li>
    <li> I think that this whitening gel worked so-so. I noticed that my teeth were a bit whiter after 2 1/2 weeks of using it. However, I&#x27;ve seen more dramatic results using the gel privded by my dentist. Also, this gel seems to go really quickly compared to other gel that I&#x27;ve used so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s worth the lower price. I will probably finish using what I have but not sure if I will buy again.</li>
    <li> After I got my teeth professionally cleaned by my dentist, he recommended this product to maintain my beautiful results.  I like this product because you only have to wear it 1-2 hours as opposed to overnight, the cost is reasonable, and the frequency of use is doable.  I don&#x27;t like the products that you can only use quarterly--too long and in between interval.  These you may use every 2-3 weeks and still maintain a stunning smile!</li>
    <li> I stated seeing results after the 3rd application!</li>
    <li> I only used once and it mede my teeth sensitive. And now everytime I brshed my teeth, my gum really hurt. It damaged my teeth and gum. I just threw them away after that use. Really disappointed.</li>
    <li> I orginally got this product from my dentist office.  I got great results and now I want to make sure I keep my teeth white so I turned to Amazon to find it cheaper.  The product I received was brand new and exactly as described.  Expiration date was better than the one I got from my dentist office.  It was the exact same thing I got from my dentist office but the price was 70% cheaper.  I use it with the tooth molds I got from my dentist, so I can&#x27;t comment on how it works without them.  I can say it gives me whiter teeth for less.  Gotta love Amazon!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize (nor did it say) that I need teeth trays, which aren&#x27;t included.  I haven&#x27;t tried the bleaching action yet so can&#x27;t comment on that.</li>
    <li> This is great just like the one you get from your dentist. But cheaper. I would buy more when needed.</li>
    <li> This did not work very well for me ! Product seems to be just something the company just threw on the shelf  so us Americans would buy...</li>
    <li> This is more like a cream than a gel, IMO -- the last product I used was very gelly (if that&#x27;s a word) and didn&#x27;t want to spread over the tooth surface. This product, though, spreads like a dream. Tastes good, too! Oh yeah: came with an unexpected little surprise: a tube of stuff to treat sensitivity in teeth/gums. I don&#x27;t need it, but teh wife loves it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this yet but I like that there is an expiration date. I&#x27;ve ordered a different brand that didn&#x27;t have it and it was old and didn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> Amazing results, I used it  for 3 weeks every night and it really worked, I wouldn&#x27;t say dramatically but it&#x27;s a really wonderful teeth withening</li>
    <li> will definitely repurchase, makes a noticeable difference after 1 use and not issues with sensitivity.  I use this product for 20 minutes and my mouth guards.  I apply the product to the mouth guards and wear them for 20 minutes.</li>
    <li> I too, originally bought this product from my dentist when they made the trays for my teeth.  It IS the exact same product with 22% Carbamide Peroxide.  My dental office knows I buy mine from Amazon.  You shouldn&#x27;t leave this strength on for more than an hour.  I&#x27;ve done that &amp; my teeth became temporarily super sensitive.  So an hour is long enough for me... maybe 2 days in a row and then again when I think of it 6 months later.</li>
    <li> works really well.  Just like the dentists supply</li>
    <li> This is the best whitener I&#x27;ve used. For me I do not experience any sensitivity after any usage even though it&#x27;s at a 22% strength.</li>
    <li> Great product and it works.  It is the same product I bought from my dentist at almost twice the price.  I highly recommend this product and definitely buy here instead of the dentist office.</li>
    <li> bought this and love it , my teeth are so white my friends are so jealous ...there gonna buy it now ...:-)</li>
    <li> Same as what my dentist sells at half the price.</li>
    <li> Whitens after 2-3 uses. Always love this brand.</li>
    <li> great service and value!</li>
    <li> Used this product after my professional whitening (dentist used same product),  Works every time--seems to be stronger than the rest out there.</li>
    <li> Same product as the dentist sells but about 30% cheaper.  Understand that this is a gel refill to be used with the trays.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and as described.</li>
    <li> Easy to use whitener. No sensitivity after use. Love that it takes only 30 min. Keeps my teeth white.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Same product my dentist first provided but in a 3-pack.</li>
    <li> These really whitened my teeth. Used it first for 30 minutes, then 2 more times for an hours.  My teeth got whiter.</li>
    <li> I had my teeth bleached by my dentist...but..after a few months, they began to look less white...my dentist made trays for me to use with this product.... have been using this Zoom Nite White about every 3 weeks &amp; it Really Works Great.&lt;br /&gt;If you have not had your teeth bleached professionally, you can still use this but you will have to buy the molded trays you can get here.</li>
    <li> Did not work as well as I hoped it would.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using whitening gel (sold by my dentist) for years.  It worked, except it always tasted nasty and was unpleasant, to say the least.  The Zoom is a HUGE improvement.  It&#x27;s actually minty, so it&#x27;s not too much worse than brushing your teeth.  As for how well it works, I used the last of my dentist provided gel on the top, the new Zoom on the bottom.  After one hour, the Zoom was at least as white, possibly even a tad bit lighter.  Also of interest, the bottom teeth weren&#x27;t as sensitive as the top--an added bonus.  Personally, I&#x27;ll be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I had my teeth whitened and purchased the bleaching trays and one extra &#x27;syringe&#x27; of whitening gel from my dentist.  Before purchasing another syringe from the dentist, I decided to check the prices on Amazon.  Wow, I was shocked and happy at the same time.  The price here for 3 of the .08 oz. syringes cost  about the same as what my dentist sells 2 of the .04 oz. syringes. And it&#x27;s the same exact product.  I compared the two products and they are identical, except for the size.  Now, I feel I can keep up with my teeth whitening and not be concerned I&#x27;m spending my kids college tuition.</li>
    <li> Seemed to work but didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> This product makes my teeth ache. I have to wait two to three days after an application before I can do the next one because the discomfort is so great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box came with a total of six syringes with gel. I&#x27;m on the last one, and while the tips of my teeth have become noticeably whiter, the rest of them have not; especially the area closest to the roots is still pretty much the original color. Maybe I have exceptionally weird teeth, but the overall effect is spotty and blotchy, with the teeth in my upper jaw lighter (and with more spots) than those in my lower jaw.</li>
    <li> Very strong and a small amount goes a very long way.</li>
    <li> I have been whitening my teeth with NiteWhite for years, and have always been fantastically happy with the results.  But times change.  Now, there are numerous strengths and sizes of NiteWhite, and you must really beware.  Unless the description specifically says \\&quot;full-size, 2.4 ml syringe\\&quot;, you&#x27;re likely to get a syringe less than half that size, which happened to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last time I paced an order, I decided to get the 22% Zoom NiteWhite instead of the NiteWhite ACP, which I&#x27;d been using, because it said that it worked more rapidly.  Not only did it not work more rapidly, IT DIDN&#x27;T WORK  AT ALL. I went through three full-size syringes with no discernible improvement whatsoever. I called Discus Dental, who makes both the ACP and Zoom, and they refused to have anything to do with it because I hadn&#x27;t purchased it from a dentist, but from SmileMedic, who fulfills the orders for Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I can think of that&#x27;s going on is that SmileMedic is selling a counterfeit product, because in over a decade, I&#x27;ve never had this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So then I called Amazon, and they couldn&#x27;t have been nicer about it, refunding my money immediately.  But now I&#x27;m in a quandary, because I don&#x27;t know who to trust or who to buy it from.  SmileMedic appears to do most of the fulfillment for Amazon, at least at the most reasonable price, but I don&#x27;t believe they are selling the real NiteWhite.  So make your own decision, but don&#x27;t say you weren&#x27;t warned.</li>
