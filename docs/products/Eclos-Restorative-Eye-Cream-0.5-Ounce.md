      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about how great they are, and I love the fact</li>
      <li>With this eye cream, the handy pump gives out the right amount, goes on smooth, hydrates and feels like quality product.  </li>

      <li>I heard such great reviews on this.</li>
      <li>I am a HUGE fan of Eclos products, and I bought the full sized version of this after finishing up my sample.  </li>
      <li>The other products in this line is spectacular!  </li>
      <li>After the first night I used this my eyelids looked more plump and both sides were more similar.</li>
      <li>It did not smell fresh.</li>
      <li>Not that I have many (in my early 30s)</li>
      <li>I LOVE this product, gentle, moisturizing and seems to be making fine wrinkles less prominent.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this to everyone!!</li>
      <li>Eclos Restorative Eye cream does exactly what the package says it will do.</li>
      <li>This was my first try of the Eclos eye cream.  </li>
      <li>Within the first week I noticed it WORKING by two weeks</li>
      <li>I noticed some fine lines around my eyes before I started using this product and now the lines are barely visible.</li>
      <li>This is an amazing product and definitely an item to buy if you have the same problem that I had!!  </li>
      <li>This is really lightweight</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not given to examining my skin in close detail very often</li>
      <li>I have bought the whole line to try..</li>
      <li>Really firms up the corners of my eyes.</li>
      <li>As I am really into apple stem cells skin renewal.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The whole echos system product line has been a main stay in my skin care line.</li>
      <li>Having used several of the other Eclos products and being very satisfied, I thought I would give it a try.  </li>
      <li>Apparently this product contains stem cells that are extracted from a rare apple.</li>
      <li>I was lucky to get this on sale for ten bucks</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>One of the containers so far, contents is hardening&#x27;!</li>
      <li>Was looking for an option that didn&#x27;t require any injections or surgery because I&#x27;m still fairly young.</li>
      <li>I was just thinking this morning that I hope this company is still in business when I&#x27;m old and wrinkled.</li>
      <li>This is non-irritating and keeps my skin soft without feeling greasy.</li>
      <li>however French products tend to be more excessive in price.  </li>
      <li>My skin is sensitive, I have rosacea and adult acne, and these are the only products I have used that do not irritate or break my skin out.  </li>
      <li>really moisturizes and makes my eye area soft and supple but the pump sucks and pumps out way way to much</li>
      <li>Yes, the eye cream is tiny, but you don&#x27;t need much and it lasts a long time.  </li>
      <li>My eyes actually look like I get sleep, contrary to what my 9 month old allows us to.</li>
      <li>Started using this product on upper eyelids and below eyes, couldn&#x27;t find anything that didn&#x27;t cause irritation to this sensitive area, till now...</li>
      <li>It stung a little bit the first time I used it</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need to depress the pump completely.</li>

<li> It stung a little bit the first time I used it</li>
<li> You don&#x27;t need to depress the pump completely.</li>
<li> It did not seem to absorb very well and the skin around my eyes felt dry after a few minutes, before I put on my make up.  </li>
<li> els and my eyes are still dry the next time I use it.</li>
<li> , I have only been using it for a little over a month now-</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not too picky with eye creams, but my last eye cream (Oil of Olay)gave me little bumps around my eye that I didn&#x27;t like!  </li>
<li> A little also goes a long way.</li>
<li> It met my expectations, however I would prefer a product that has eye serum due to the climate in which I reside.  </li>
<li> Only problem is, it&#x27;s hard to find in stores (even those who do carry the Eclos products).  </li>
<li> It also got rid of dark patches caused by sun damage.  </li>
<li> I was looking for something to conceal dark under-eye circles.  </li>
<li> but several people have remarked in wonder lately that I have no wrinkles at my age....</li>
<li> Reduce the puffiness and dark shadows under my eyes.  </li>
<li> Although it&#x27;s in a small container it lasts a long time.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a half a year and didn&#x27;t get comments like that before, so</li>
<li> but I feel like this just didn&#x27;t diminish my little wrinkles around my eyes at all and did nothing for dark circles or puffiness.</li>
<li> so I just push down just a little</li>
<li> but they do get very very dry which is not very good because that can cause lines.</li>
<li> I had one eye that was aging a little faster</li>
<li> Containers were small and the pump containers have a lot of waste.</li>
<li> the the dark circles were GONE!!  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s the cream doing it</li>
<li> A small press is all you need.</li>
<li> not many of us have $150 to drop on eye cream)  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is just what i have been searching for in an eye cream, for quite some time now!!&lt;br /&gt;And it works fantastically!! I have bought the whole line to try.. As I am really into apple stem cells skin renewal.&lt;br /&gt;It is great for anti-aging etc.. I give the the thumbs up, all the way!!</li>
    <li> Works well, non greasy, could not find in any stores any more. Glad to find it on line!</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Effective and soothing. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Smelled awful.  Got into eyes.  Will never purchase again.</li>
    <li> I admit my eyes arent a problem area for me but they do get very very dry which is not very good because that can cause lines. Well this is GREAT for under makeup but it is so basic makes no difference in anything els and my eyes are still dry the next time I use it. It does not irritate like the rest of the line did. I will finish it up but I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I have to say, I love these products.  Yes, the eye cream is tiny, but you don&#x27;t need much and it lasts a long time.  My skin is sensitive, I have rosacea and adult acne, and these are the only products I have used that do not irritate or break my skin out.  I have noticed a huge difference in my skin since using them.  I no longer have bumps under my skin, red patches, flaking, breaking out, etc.  It also got rid of dark patches caused by sun damage.  I can&#x27;t say enough about how great they are, and I love the fact the they use essential oils and have no parabens or sulfates.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as it seemed appropriate for the issues I have around my eyes.  It stung a little bit the first time I used it and although you can almost &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; the moisture going into the tissues, I am not seeing the results I had anticipated.  I probably won&#x27;t order this again, despite the &amp;#34;add on&amp;#34; price.</li>
    <li> 5 stars on quality and texture of product, I use it, and has a luxury salon scent&lt;br /&gt;3 stars on the size for the price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is only a half ounce for the $money, luckily you need less than a pearl size to put on both eyes.</li>
    <li> One of the containers so far, contents is hardening&#x27;!</li>
    <li> This is a nice, non-irritating cream.  I was looking for something to conceal dark under-eye circles.  This is not the product for that.</li>
    <li> This is the best skin care product I have found and the price is good also. I gave this product as gifts to two of my friends and it worked great for them, they loved it too.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Really firms up the corners of my eyes. Just don&#x27;t get it in your eyes -- it burns!  Although it&#x27;s in a small container it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this eye cream.  It sells else where for $22.00.  When I found it on Amazon I was beyond excited!!  I have tried every eye cream out there (under $30 cause lets face it not many of us have $150 to drop on eye cream)  I HAD darkening and scaly looking dots under my eyes.  Within the first week I noticed it WORKING by two weeks the the dark circles were GONE!!  and within the month the scaly looking skin had DISAPPEARED!!  I use a pea size amount for both eyes morning and night!! This is an amazing product and definitely an item to buy if you have the same problem that I had!!  I highly recommend this to everyone!!</li>
    <li> Have used this from the beginning of it&#x27;s release,  it has been very good. The whole echos system product line has been a main stay in my skin care line.</li>
    <li> Mom got this to help with skin care. A must have for your daily cleansing. Give this a look.</li>
    <li> It did not smell fresh. Can&#x27;t tell if it does anything yet, as I don&#x27;t have wrinkles. I have been using the restorative face cream, which is perfect for me. Smells good &amp; moisturizes .</li>
    <li> Love this eye cream for day and night works great and really moisturizes and makes my eye area soft and supple but the pump sucks and pumps out way way to much so I just push down just a little</li>
    <li> I love this product!!! It is absolutely the best and makes my skin feel wonderful!!!! Would recommend this to anyone!!</li>
    <li> I was just thinking this morning that I hope this company is still in business when I&#x27;m old and wrinkled.</li>
    <li> I have tried tons of under eye cream and this is the best!!!</li>
    <li> Love eclos! Saw a noticible difference within two weeks. I use the prep, eye cream and moisturizer faithfully. My skin is smooth, radiant and wrinkle free!</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, feels great, and makes my skin feel/look fresh. My eyes actually look like I get sleep, contrary to what my 9 month old allows us to.</li>
    <li> I heard such great reviews on this. So I bought it , I have only been using it for a little over a month now- no results yet.</li>
    <li> This is non-irritating and keeps my skin soft without feeling greasy. I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s the cream doing it but several people have remarked in wonder lately that I have no wrinkles at my age....hmmmm.... I&#x27;ve been using this for about a half a year and didn&#x27;t get comments like that before, so I went to check my crow&#x27;s feet area next to my eyes and indeed I don&#x27;t see any wrinkles where I recall seeing them last spring. I&#x27;m not given to examining my skin in close detail very often so I hadn&#x27;t noticed the improvement until one of my co-workers brought it to my attention. I&#x27;m truly surprised...and  rather pleased! I think this cream actually works!</li>
    <li> I am a HUGE fan of Eclos products, and I bought the full sized version of this after finishing up my sample.  I&#x27;m not too picky with eye creams, but my last eye cream (Oil of Olay)gave me little bumps around my eye that I didn&#x27;t like!  Some allergic reaction.  With this eye cream, the handy pump gives out the right amount, goes on smooth, hydrates and feels like quality product.  The other products in this line is spectacular!  I&#x27;m not sure I will reorder again since on Dr Oz, they are saying eye creams are over-priced glorified moisturizers with the same exact ingredients as a regular moisturizer! I may just use the night cream/moisturizer as an eye cream when I run out!</li>
    <li> Loved it.  Reduce the puffiness and dark shadows under my eyes.  I dp recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Cannot get product out of the container.  Eclos Restorative Eye Cream, 0.5-Ounce:: Re-ordered cause I was getting low and upon arrival did not inspect or try to use the product till I was on a Trip for weeks. I purchased a local alternative to use till I returned home. I like the product when the dispenser works. Please replace defective product.</li>
    <li> Started using this product on upper eyelids and below eyes, couldn&#x27;t find anything that didn&#x27;t cause irritation to this sensitive area, till now... I LOVE this product, gentle, moisturizing and seems to be making fine wrinkles less prominent. Couldn&#x27;t remember where I got it at, searched through my regular shops, to no avail, then I checked on Amazon &amp;  Yea!! found it!!! Great stuff!!!</li>
    <li> ...Not that I have many (in my early 30s) but I feel like this just didn&#x27;t diminish my little wrinkles around my eyes at all and did nothing for dark circles or puffiness.</li>
    <li> This was my first try of the Eclos eye cream.  Having used several of the other Eclos products and being very satisfied, I thought I would give it a try.  It is a white lotion like cream in a pump tube, no smell to speak of.  It did not seem to absorb very well and the skin around my eyes felt dry after a few minutes, before I put on my make up.  I want alittle more out of my moisturizers.</li>
    <li> Containers were small and the pump containers have a lot of waste. Will not buy this product on line again.</li>
    <li> It met my expectations, however I would prefer a product that has eye serum due to the climate in which I reside.  I love Eclos products and will use them often.  The price point is affordable and not out of range for most.  I used to use Esthederm and it was extremely expensive.  I love Carole Frank products however French products tend to be more excessive in price.  If my it were my line to market, I would introduce after sun products like Esthederm.</li>
    <li> I have been using all the Eclos products for a month or so and LOVE it.I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product and would recommend it to anyone.  Only problem is, it&#x27;s hard to find in stores (even those who do carry the Eclos products).  Have to order online.</li>
    <li> I had one eye that was aging a little faster and I felt asymmetrical. Was looking for an option that didn&#x27;t require any injections or surgery because I&#x27;m still fairly young. I believe the problem was that the eyelid was thinning so I was looking to restore and add volume. After the first night I used this my eyelids looked more plump and both sides were more similar. This is really lightweight so I was able to wear it under my makeup during the day too. It also smells nice and applies smoothly.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing eye cream! Upon application, I noticed immediate results, tightening skin! These plant stem cells are very potent!</li>
    <li> Great. Disapointed Eclos is discontinuing. Don&#x27;t understand why.</li>
    <li> To be honest here, if you use their face moisturizer for around the eyes it works great. This eye cream does not do a thing!</li>
    <li> Not tested on animals.  Good product and price~</li>
    <li> Eclos Restorative Eye cream does exactly what the package says it will do. I noticed some fine lines around my eyes before I started using this product and now the lines are barely visible. Apparently this product contains stem cells that are extracted from a rare apple. This also contains lots of essential oils like rosewood and ylang ylang. A little also goes a long way. You don&#x27;t need to depress the pump completely. A small press is all you need. I was lucky to get this on sale for ten bucks but I&#x27;d buy it again for twenty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
