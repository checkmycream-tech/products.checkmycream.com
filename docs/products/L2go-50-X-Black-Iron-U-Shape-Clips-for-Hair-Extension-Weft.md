### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent U shaped clip for securing your Lace Front Wig.  </li>
      <li>Great buy!!!</li>
      <li>These were perfect for my extensions I was making.</li>
      <li>These clips are not the best.</li>
      <li>Excellent!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I had purchased wefts and intended to make my own clip in extensions.</li>
      <li>and they were effective</li>
      <li>While they were a bit smaller than anticipated, the clips work great and were actually a perfect size for the hair extensions I was making.</li>
      <li>Some of the clips might break easily, so be warned!</li>
      <li>They are easy to use!</li>
      <li>Love my clip in extensions.</li>
      <li>and hopefully that works out better.</li>
      <li>I love these clips..</li>
      <li>I was excited to buy these!</li>
      <li>Any needle I used fit just fine.</li>
      <li>I will most likely be ordering more because work a lot with hair and will need more.</li>
      <li>so these little things are pretty good!</li>
      <li>Besides this one flaw, they are worth the purchase.</li>
      <li>They get the job done and for the price, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>They do hold good, but just be careful with them</li>
      <li>Definitely a worthwhile purchase because typical beauty supply stores do not sell clips that have more that 4 in a pack.</li>
      <li>mine came super fast, like two days after I ordered them.&lt;br</li>
      <li>they are so small and when l clip the clips there very flate lol l can tell l will be having fun this summer time.</li>
      <li>they hold pretty well and snap well as well.</li>
      <li>Shipped fast too!</li>
      <li>They held much stronger when I did that.</li>
      <li>l really like them</li>
      <li>I liked these clips because they were small enough to not be seen when I make clip-ins.</li>
      <li>Love the clips for extra long bangs of different colors.</li>
      <li>I was surprised to see that the clips were small, which I actually think I like better than the larger clips.</li>
      <li>You can understand my disappointment when they came and there was less than 50 clips and a good 10 of them were broke!</li>
      <li>So, I made a trip to the dollar general down the road and got a few packs of super glue.</li>

<li> They really don&#x27;t work unless you have something extremely small to use it on.</li>
<li> I expected larger clips</li>
<li> Can rip ur hair out, if u wear them to long in a wig or clip ins.</li>
<li> The clips held, still hold, and every once in a while, they do come loose, but i carry around my glue with me.</li>
<li> but then they started to fall apart the black paint they put on the outside</li>
<li> They become hard to open and close, so you might need to fold them in a bit.</li>
<li> in mind that they are really small, like less than an inch long.</li>
<li> The sizes makes then discreet and less bulky.</li>
<li> I wore them for a month and a half</li>
<li> it was just a mess</li>
<li> I would recommend flexing the clips a little bit before sewing hair to them, though.</li>
<li> made a few hairpieces for daughter.&lt;br /&gt;Exactly</li>
<li> I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have wasted my money.</li>
<li> I usually get the correct amount, but this time however, I received 40 clips instead of 50 😒.</li>
<li> Small clips lots of hold.</li>
<li> These clips were small, but they&#x27;re supposed to be.</li>
<li> These small clips get the job done.</li>
<li> but it does not clip even with a small amount of hair.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s too small to attach the combs onto it -</li>
<li> These were WAAAAYYYY to small for me to use.  </li>
<li> :/</li>
<li> The hole on the clips are really small, so the needle might not fit into al of them!</li>
<li> A few arrived broken</li>
<li> They are small nothing wrong with that</li>
<li> Even the slightest amount of hair can make it to where the clip wont snap on your hai an its quite frustrating</li>
<li> and I had horrible hair loss from the clips by my edges</li>

    <li> Would bit these again and again!</li>
    <li> While they were a bit smaller than anticipated, the clips work great and were actually a perfect size for the hair extensions I was making. Shipped fast too!</li>
    <li> They become hard to open and close, so you might need to fold them in a bit. The hole on the clips are really small, so the needle might not fit into al of them! Some of the clips might break easily, so be warned!</li>
    <li> I love these clips..I usually get the correct amount, but this time however, I received 40 clips instead of 50 😒.</li>
    <li> Excellent U shaped clip for securing your Lace Front Wig.  A must have item for you  of you wig makes.</li>
    <li> Love my clip in extensions. These small clips get the job done. However, not all the clips snap to my hair. Besides this one flaw, they are worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> I broke several of these clips. I eventually gave up on these and bought a different brand. I would not recommend these.</li>
    <li> I received the product before the final estimated delivery date. I was surprised to see that the clips were small, which I actually think I like better than the larger clips. I will most likely be ordering more because work a lot with hair and will need more. Definitely a worthwhile purchase because typical beauty supply stores do not sell clips that have more that 4 in a pack.</li>
    <li> I sewed these clips into my hair extensions and now I don&#x27;t need anyone&#x27;s help to put them in! Saves me time and money.</li>
    <li> Small clips lots of hold. Great buy!!! The sizes makes then discreet and less bulky. They are easy to use!</li>
    <li> These were perfect for my extensions I was making. I had purchased wefts and intended to make my own clip in extensions. These clips were small, but they&#x27;re supposed to be. Any needle I used fit just fine. I just used regular sewing needles. The problem I ran into was my ginormous fingers getting in the way. So, I made a trip to the dollar general down the road and got a few packs of super glue. The clips held, still hold, and every once in a while, they do come loose, but i carry around my glue with me. I am actually ordering another set of clips to have on hand as we speak.</li>
    <li> I was excited to buy these! You can understand my disappointment when they came and there was less than 50 clips and a good 10 of them were broke! I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have wasted my money.</li>
    <li> Women with ethic hair why relax hair and then damage hair with color. Take these clips sew on the hair weave to the clip in whatever color you want .... And attach to hair instant highlights without bleach or added color. Love it!</li>
    <li> Completed my Halloween costume! Excellent! I would recommend flexing the clips a little bit before sewing hair to them, though. They held much stronger when I did that.</li>
    <li> I expected larger clips</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too small to attach the combs onto it - I guess you need a teeny tiny needle or something.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of my money.</li>
    <li> Love the clips for extra long bangs of different colors. made a few hairpieces for daughter.&lt;br /&gt;Exactly whats pictured here.</li>
    <li> I was using these clips to make clip ins and I braided ny hair for extra security and for a protective style for my weave clip ins. I wore them for a month and a half and they were effective but then they started to fall apart the black paint they put on the outside started to come off and I had horrible hair loss from the clips by my edges the clips were tangling in my hair it was just a mess</li>
    <li> I liked these clips because they were small enough to not be seen when I make clip-ins. A few arrived broken but it&#x27;s a pack of 50 so it wasn&#x27;t a big deal. They get the job done and for the price, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> They really don&#x27;t work unless you have something extremely small to use it on. Even the slightest amount of hair can make it to where the clip wont snap on your hai an its quite frustrating</li>
    <li> so these little things are pretty good! mine came super fast, like two days after I ordered them.&lt;br /&gt;keep in mind that they are really small, like less than an inch long. they hold pretty well and snap well as well.</li>
    <li> This clips dont work. They are small nothing wrong with that but it does not clip even with a small amount of hair.</li>
    <li> l really like them they are so small and when l clip the clips there very flate lol l can tell l will be having fun this summer time.</li>
    <li> Can rip ur hair out, if u wear them to long in a wig or clip ins. They do hold good, but just be careful with them</li>
    <li> These were WAAAAYYYY to small for me to use.  bought them to make clip ins, but I ended up just going to my local bss and purchasing the size I needed.</li>
    <li> These clips are not the best. It didn&#x27;t even snap when I tried to use it :/ I&#x27;m gonna try another product and hopefully that works out better.</li>
