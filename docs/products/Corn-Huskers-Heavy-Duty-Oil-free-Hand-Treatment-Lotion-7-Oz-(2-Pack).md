      <li>it is watered down and contains a higher percentage of alcohol which shouldn&#x27;t be used at all in a lotion...not happy</li>
      <li>but it wasn&#x27;t right for me.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Problem is it wears off quickly which requires reapplication which is ok, but would like it to last longer.</li>
      <li>I needed them very fast  because of my fingerprint appointment and They arrived on time</li>
      <li>At the first time I used I could see the result.</li>
      <li>It makes my hands soft and smooth without ANY greasy residue.  </li>
      <li>The fragrance smells exactly like Johnson&#x27;s baby powder, (it&#x27;s a Johnson and Johnson product).</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I was looking online for a solution and saw good things written about both Corn Huskers Heavy Duty Hand Treatment and O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s Working Hands Cream.  </li>

      <li>I really like this Corn Huskers lotion.</li>
      <li>Works very well.  </li>
      <li>It is very sticky.</li>

      <li>bottle lasts for along time and they worked  very well for me.</li>
      <li>It does have a slight scent but it dissipates quickly and isn&#x27;t an offensive or a strong scent.  </li>
      <li>this product.my husband does concrete work at times and this product works very well for cracked hands.</li>
      <li>It does however, leave a slight tackiness to your hands which frankly, is better than grease.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have no idea if this will happen for others, but is the only explanation my bruises seem to be fading quickly.</li>
      <li>I have tried virtually every hand moisturizer on the market...from drug store brand to high end.  </li>

      <li>The first - and last - time I used</li>
      <li>It completely dissolves into your skin leaving them very soft as if you just washed your hands with moisturizing hand soap.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Most amazing thing I&#x27;ve ever used. It completely dissolves into your skin leaving them very soft as if you just washed your hands with moisturizing hand soap. My hands have always gotten extremely dry and cracked in the winter but I would never use lotion because they always leave your hands all greasy, even the ones that claim they don&#x27;t. I just tried the O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s Working Hands and it leaves your hands waxy for hours. Corn Huskers dissolves completely in maybe a minute. Only slight downside is that it smells kinda strongly of a lotion/cleaner type smell, but no big deal based on how well it works.</li>
    <li> Item was as described</li>
    <li> Non greasy, non smelling.  Works very well.  The only lotion my husband will use.</li>
    <li> Best you can get. If your hands are dry to the point of your skin cracking, this stuff will moisturize and heal them in just a few days.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using it and it does make my skin feel softer and more moist.</li>
    <li> I needed them very fast  because of my fingerprint appointment and They arrived on time but I guess it&#x27;s  cheaper to buy them at walmart .each bottle lasts for along time and they worked  very well for me.</li>
    <li> Hard to find product at a good price&lt;br /&gt;FAST shipping</li>
    <li> Very good cream keeps your skin nice and soft and smells good. Will recommend</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.I bought it at Walgreen.I&#x27;m diabetic and have extemely dry skin.I&#x27;ve used baby oil and about every type of lotion on my skin but nothing worked for me except Corn Huskers Lotion.I will keep buying it.My legs are no longer dry but nice and soft.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who doesn&#x27;t like lotion that leaves a lot of oil on your hands.  This lotion does a great job on my hands.  I personally don&#x27;t have dry hands but I just don&#x27;t like lotion with oil on my hands and this is perfect.  My boyfriend on the other hand has very dry hands but also doesn&#x27;t like the feel of lotion with oil so this works well for him and it takes away the dryness.  It takes a little getting use to for those who have never used it but once you get use to it, you will love it.</li>
    <li> Used for itchy head a couple days after shaving and eczema on hands. Works just as it was recommended to me. No oil-base is a huge plus.</li>
    <li> This winter was particularly brutal on my hands, leaving them dry, rough and susceptible to bleeding.  I was looking online for a solution and saw good things written about both Corn Huskers Heavy Duty Hand Treatment and O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s Working Hands Cream.  I bought 2 bottles of this product - one for home and one for the office. The first - and last - time I used it was a morning at work. I put the lotion on and was hit by the odor.  I thought it might fade quickly, but that wasn&#x27;t the case. I smelled it while eating my breakfast, drinking water and answering the phone - pretty much anytime my hands were in proximity to my face. I assumed my colleagues could smell the odor as well, prompting me to scrub my hands. For all I know, this could be a great product and it may have done the job if I gave it a real chance - but it wasn&#x27;t right for me.</li>
    <li> Hard to find in stores.  Husband swears by this stuff.</li>
    <li> Use for fingerprinting at work, definitely helps show fingerprint ridges better and ensures for better results for applicants.</li>
    <li> Amazing how this product is so hard to get in the stores.  Best product I have ever used for dry hands.</li>
    <li> Seems to be the only lotion that will minimize splitting of the skin on and around the ends of fingers. It does not eliminate the problem but lessens the intensity.</li>
    <li> We LOVE this lotion! This is one of the very few lotions that helped keep my and my husband&#x27;s hands softer during the bitter cold we experienced this winter.</li>
    <li> Outstanding product. Not oily, but keeps your hands protected . I would  strongly recommend this product. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> All Right, I know they call it hand lotion, but when dry skin hits me in the winter time I can use this anywhere and it is a non-greasy lotion that cures the heebeejeebee itches.  Also works great to aid the healing of paper cuts.  Good all-round hand lotion-body rub.</li>
    <li> this product is not of the quality that they use to sell...it is watered down and contains a higher percentage of alcohol which shouldn&#x27;t be used at all in a lotion...not happy</li>
    <li> just what I expected.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a cleaner to help get the grease off my hands but not dry them out and leave them rough  THIS DOES IT</li>
    <li> Initially tacky on application but it quickly absorbs smoothly!  Softens your hands nicely!</li>
    <li> This product was impossible to find locally for me. It was used by my family for years and is not oilly and to me helps with the dry cracking skin</li>
    <li> Bought this for my son-in-law for his work roughened hands. He really likes it because it is oil free and therefore not &#x27;greasy&#x27;. Good product that has been around a long time.</li>
    <li> Very good product and only product to keep my husband&#x27;s hand moist. Would recommend this product to anyone that work with there hands.</li>
    <li> I started using Cornhuskers lotion in 1960 when we were living in Cheyenne Wyoming helping activate an Atlas Intercontinental Ballistic Missile, ICBM, base. Winters are harsh in Wyoming and I was informed, by a pharmacist that it was the only lotion that would work.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it ever since and would recommend it to anyone, especially if theywere going to be exposed to bad weather.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my father. He lives in eastern New Mexico and during the winter months sufferes from extrememly dry hands. He works outside most of the day so the extreme cold dries out the moisture on his hands. Corn Huskers lotion saves the day. He uses it daily and while it doesnt completely fix the dry hands it definately helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reasonably priced and if you are a &amp;#34;Prime&amp;#34; member, like me, you will have it in two days.</li>
    <li> I love cornhusker&#x27;s lotion. I can&#x27;t seem to find it anywhere. So glad I found it. The best lotion ever for dry skin.</li>
    <li> Perfect for HCG diet and is non oily</li>
    <li> My hands crack &amp; bleed every winter. I originally bought &#x27;Gloves In A Bottle&#x27; - horribly AWFUL product, within just 3 days my hands were so nasty. Saw a doctor who recommended Corn Husker Lotion - since no one carried it in-store I ordered from Amazon. Even after waiting a couple days for it to arrive showed no improvement in my hands, but after receiving it, and putting it on frequently, my hands are coming around!  Yahoo!  It only takes very little product to use, and even though my hands aren&#x27;t 100% yet! they are so, so much better. Wish I had found this &amp; used it from the start. Recommend!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product to use on dry skin. I&#x27;ve been using it for over 40 years. It soothes your feet &amp; prevents sores.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Never used it before, nice mild scent. Starts off sticky but drys as it absorbs into your skin.</li>
    <li> My hands are very dry. This really does it for me without being too smelly or too wet.</li>
    <li> Worked great on restoring the surface of my fingers, soften my hands and was as advertised all expectations were meet.</li>
    <li> love this stuff.  boys who hunt/fish/trap use it to keep their hands from cracking and chapping in the cold temps/cold waters</li>
    <li> I have used this for years but have had trouble finding it locally. It is great for dry rough hands and feet. I have recommended it to others for many years and others love it when they give it  a try. An unexpected benefit: I am 75 and find I get bruises on the back of my hands easily. The Corn Huskers seems to fad the bruises for me. I have no idea if this will happen for others, but is the only explanation my bruises seem to be fading quickly.</li>
    <li> My husband love this for dry hands</li>
    <li> This is the best treatment for dry hands.  Learned about this from working on the farm, one of the best kept secrets to remoisturizing the skin of hard workers.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best, hands-down, without a doubt, dry-skin treatment lotion. It&#x27;s good not just for the hands, but for any part of your body that needs moisturizing. I have been using it for 50 years and have never found anything as good.</li>
    <li> This works very well on extremely dry, ashy hands. My hands tend to crack in the winter and get ashy from repeated washings. This lotion is the only kind that been able to keep my hands baby soft even after it absorbs. Most lotions work until they are fully absorbed, then the ash returns. The Corn Husker&#x27;s keeps the ash away.</li>
    <li> My mother used this in the 60s. I bought it for my daughter-in-law&#x27;s cracked hands. She has used it for a week and loves it. It&#x27;s not think and heavy seems to absorb well.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful product. At the first time I used I could see the result.</li>
    <li> I love the Corn Huskers lotion! It softens rough hands &amp; obsorbs completely, leaving no greasy feeling like some lotions I&#x27;ve tried. The order was sent packaged well &amp; was on time, would buy again! Thanks!</li>
    <li> This lotion is very thin and silky, absorbs quickly, and makes your hands soft. It  washes off fairly easily and needs to be reapplied often. There is no residue leftover unless you use too much. The fragrance smells exactly like Johnson&#x27;s baby powder, (it&#x27;s a Johnson and Johnson product). Overall, a good product, but I would like it better if it was fragrance free and lasted longer between applications.</li>
    <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t leave my hands oily.</li>
    <li> It is getting harder and harder to find this in stores, so glad to have found it on Amazon.  This works better for dry skin than anything else I have found.  Sometimes the old fashioned ways are the best ways.</li>
    <li> Product arrived as promised</li>
    <li> If nothing else will heal your dry, flaky, itchy skin (that may be sensitive or allergic to other products), this will help!</li>
    <li> Saved my hands this winter.. Got others hook on this stuff</li>
    <li> This lotion is wonderful!  It makes my hands soft and smooth without ANY greasy residue.  It is a little pricey, but totally worth it.  My only wish is that it gave me a little more moisture...but overall great product.</li>
    <li> This is for my husband who does a lot of work that &amp;#34;roughs up&amp;#34; his hands. He loves this lotion because it does the job but is not greasy &amp; absorbs in the skin.</li>
    <li> The best hand lotion money can buy!!  I&#x27;ve been using it for years and years, and I&#x27;ll buy no other!</li>
    <li> Love this it dose a great job and have told a lot of my friends about it and how it order it.</li>
    <li> An old favorite of my dad&#x27;s (and, frankly, he passed away in 1970.  So glad I rediscovered it!  Dad always used it before playing at The Arm-Benders Club, a monthly poker club for gentlemen who worked together (penny ante poker).  It smooths your hands without making them greasy.</li>
    <li> This relieves itching when nothing else works.  A small amount goes a long way.  I have an itchy area on my leg.  The doctor has prescribed many medications.  This eliminates the itch for days.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use on my pig&#x27;s skin.  I really do not like the texture!  It just seems to stay on him wet for a while.  It is very sticky.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff, it&#x27;s what her grandfather used and she&#x27;s happy I was able to find it. I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s still made.</li>
    <li> This got to be the best hand softner ever, I had a time trying to find a store that sold it,Walmart, Walgreens etc.we checked but they were out or not carring it anymore.</li>
    <li> I have tried virtually every hand moisturizer on the market...from drug store brand to high end.  I actually saw a coupon in the newspaper for this product and tried to find it locally without success so I ordered it from Amazon.  I didn&#x27;t have any high expectations.  To the best of my recollection, I received the product within 2 days of ordering and it is exceptional.  It does have a slight scent but it dissipates quickly and isn&#x27;t an offensive or a strong scent.  It adsorbs immediately which no other product does.  I use it on my hands, elbows and legs.  I will definitely reorder but in a larger size.</li>
    <li> Great for really dry skin.  A little goes a long way and it&#x27;s not greasy. Men tend to love that aspect of this lotion. It reminds me more of a serum because it doesn&#x27;t leave everything sticky.</li>
    <li> Myself and my family are very happy with this product.my husband does concrete work at times and this product works very well for cracked hands.</li>
    <li> Years ago I went to college in the fields deep in the Midwest. I spent one summer there working in a factory but my hands got very dry, they started cracking, and it was fairly painful. One of my friends who spent his days detasseling corn suggested I try the lotion they used at work. So I have been using and recommending Corn Huskers Lotion since that day. Double thumbs up.</li>
    <li> My Mother used this product when I was a kid. I tried it as a lark, but actually love it. It&#x27;s not greasy, and absorbs quickly. The flip top lid is awesome.</li>
    <li> I really like this Corn Huskers lotion. It&#x27;s cool when applied, isn&#x27;t greasy, and washes off your hands with plain water. My only negative comment has to do with price. This product can be purchased at Walmart for $3 a bottle. So Amazon isn&#x27;t the best place to shop.</li>
    <li> this stuff is the best</li>
    <li> Now that winter is almost over, I can give you a little feedback on this lotion. It does the trick immediately after putting it on, rubs into your hands quickly and does not leave a greasy feeling. It does however, leave a slight tackiness to your hands which frankly, is better than grease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem is it wears off quickly which requires reapplication which is ok, but would like it to last longer.</li>
