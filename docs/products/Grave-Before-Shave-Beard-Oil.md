      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>My boyfriend is in love with his beard and now he is in love with this brand and scent of beard oil.</li>
      <li>love the smell of this bead oil.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other beard oils before and grave before shave makes the best scented and overall best beard oils.</li>
      <li>Works very well and has a pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>It tamed his wild man beard and made it smell great.</li>
      <li>Good product for a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>My man liked it at first</li>
      <li>The smell is a very fresh smell that I happen to love, because I love to smell and be fresh to death.</li>
      <li>Perfect conditioner for my beard with just a light citrus scent that is only noticeable when you first put it on.</li>
      <li>Top notch product that leaves my beard nice and soft.</li>
      <li>I literally have strangers asking to touch my beard and asking what I put in it to make it look so fantastic.  </li>
      <li>Got my beard silky and smooth</li>
      <li>so soft, also I believe this oil is good for all races.</li>
      <li>This was my first use of a beard oil, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, and I do admit that I was hoping that it had a stronger taming affect on civil war-sized beardliness.  </li>
      <li>Light feeling when applied, great (but not overpowering) Lavender and lime scent and makes my beard softer than any other oil I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
      <li>The smell is clean and fresh and not overpowering.  </li>
      <li>But overall, I am pleased with the softening affect and healthy sheen</li>
      <li>My beard is pretty good sized and 3-4 drops is all I need, so the bottle should last a couple months.  </li>
      <li>Definitely NOT disappointment.</li>
      <li>As other reviewers have remarked, this concoction has a great earthy scent with a fresh overtone of citrus lemon that makes forest pine glades jealous of my masculine glow.  </li>
      <li>but you don&#x27;t need very much of it.  </li>
      <li>this makes my beard very manageable!</li>
      <li>so he says it turns smelly on a hot day.  </li>
      <li>This is my first time using this product.</li>
      <li>Will be ordering more in the future.</li>
      <li>Thanks, Grave Before Shave Beard Oil!</li>
      <li>Anyone with a man who takes pride in his facial hair should do themselves a favor and add this item to their cart; not only will your man love the way it makes them feel, you&#x27;ll love the way it smells (eucalyptus and camomile like).</li>
      <li>I used it when I first started to let my beard grow.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>Ive never used beard oil before and didn&#x27;t really know what to expect.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>My beard is left with a nice look and overall fullness.</li>
      <li>If you keep your short or your hair naturally lays down this is a great product for you.</li>
      <li>Will definitely be purchasing more, this is a life long products.</li>
      <li>We live in Florida</li>
      <li>That being said, GBS beard oil really takes it to the next level.  </li>
      <li>It kept my skin moisturized and my beard soft.  </li>
      <li>In the age of essential oils reaching a new height in popularity, this beard oil reaches a new height in creating a righteous glow about my face mane.  </li>
      <li>Maybe if you live up north you won&#x27;t get the same effect.</li>

    <li> Awesome! Got my beard silky and smooth</li>
    <li> Product works great. The scent for this one smells a little like Vicks vapo rub or something like that but it disappears quickly if it&#x27;s not for you. My beard is looking good and the hairs are feeling healthy. Definitely buying from this brand again just a different scent</li>
    <li> My beard now opens the car door for me, as well as giving my wife back rubs. It has started taking classes for its Doctorate. Thanks, Grave Before Shave Beard Oil!</li>
    <li> I have a pretty awesome beard.  That being said, GBS beard oil really takes it to the next level.  I literally have strangers asking to touch my beard and asking what I put in it to make it look so fantastic.  This stuff is the bee&#x27;s knees.  I wanted something that smells nice without making the beard smell like a pine tree of basket of flowers.  GBS delivers.  The smell is clean and fresh and not overpowering.  The bottle is pretty small but you don&#x27;t need very much of it.  My beard is pretty good sized and 3-4 drops is all I need, so the bottle should last a couple months.  Additionally, GBS has some killer artwork on the bottle for the aesthetically inclined.  Bottom line, get this beard oil, apply, become a rock star.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised, I love it, girlfriend loves it, thats all that matters!!</li>

    <li> Works very well and has a pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> I love it. It smells like Mountain Dew to me.</li>
    <li> I started using Fisticuffs wax about 4 months ago,I got the oil/wax combo for the great reviews,and I love the oil it has the best scent,it coats my gnarly beard and makes it shine and the wax has the same scent,so pleasant and light......bitchen stickers too........Rasta vibes</li>
    <li> My husband loves his beard oil. Best stuff ever.</li>
    <li> Very awesome product and very professional business. If you want to soften your beard, help it grow not to mention give it a great sent this is your product. Will be ordering more in the future.</li>
    <li> I loved the way it makes my beard feel and it smells great!  I recommend it for some but not for all.  My face broke out immediately after I started using this product.  Your beard will look great but underneath, its gonna look like a teenager with an acne problem.</li>
    <li> Smells great, wife loves it, not greasy at all. Top notch product that leaves my beard nice and soft.</li>
    <li> Love this product! You have a customer for life.</li>

    <li> Absolutely amazing. Light feeling when applied, great (but not overpowering) Lavender and lime scent and makes my beard softer than any other oil I&#x27;ve owned. Will definitely be keeping GBSBO in my collection.</li>

    <li> Grave Before Shave Beard Oil has a great lemony scent.  I used it when I first started to let my beard grow.  It kept my skin moisturized and my beard soft.  As my beard got longer the oil wouldn&#x27;t help contain stray hairs and I had to move on to a beard balm.  If you keep your short or your hair naturally lays down this is a great product for you.</li>
    <li> This oil is great makes my beard oh so soft, also I believe this oil is good for all races. Me being an black man with course/curly hair this makes my beard very manageable! The smell is a very fresh smell that I happen to love, because I love to smell and be fresh to death. Will be buying more.</li>
    <li> My husband loves all of your bear oils.  Great item.</li>
    <li> Good sent, wife loves it!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend after careful research. Definitely NOT disappointment. I love the smell and so does he. His beard feels amazing just after one use. Highly recommend!</li>
