    <li> My daughter is 15 and she loves this deodorent..We both like the smell and it works very well without clumping up or leaving a white mark on your cloths.  [[ASIN:B000MASTJM Teen Spirit Antiperspirant Deodorant, Sweet Strawberry, 2.3-Ounce Stick (Pack of 6)]]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an adult and I&#x27;m not ashamed to say that I love Teen Spirit.  I&#x27;ve tried all the fancy deodorants, and all of the natural deodorants, and I keep coming back to Teen Spirit.  It works great and keeps me dry, much better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried.  My favorite scents are strawberry (EXACTLY the same smell as the taste of Strawberry Bubbalicious gum) and coconut (pure, clean, more adulty-y).  Unfortunately it seems Teen Spirit is getting harder to find in the store.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite deodorant of any I ever used in my entire life. This deodorant works great for me and smells really good. I used to buy it at Walmart and other places and then starting a couple of years ago, I couldn&#x27;t find it anymore. I used different deodorants for the last two years but nothing worked well and nothing smelled that good, either.    I am really happy with this purchase. I ordered a 6-pack. They took about a week to arrive with free shipping (I signed up for the automatic delivery plan so the price was fantastic and free shipping.) The deodorants that came in the mail were very fresh. I am so happy to have my favorite deodorant back. I don&#x27;t understand why stores don&#x27;t carry it anymore.</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant, it works well for me. I enjoy it&#x27;s scent. I&#x27;ve tried others, and nothing compares. Not sure why I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used teen spirit for 19 years. In fact I tried another brand and my arm pits revolted in swelling pain. I love the smell, like fruity candy. Every guy I&#x27;ve ever dated loves the way I smell and I owe it in part to fruity juicy scented deodorant. Ive used berry blast mostly but its been discontinued, so strawberry was my next pick and it&#x27;s great. Smells like bubbleyum strawberry. It works great, no stink for me, been using this scent for years, smells great from 8am to 9pm. It&#x27;s hard to find in stores so I stock up off amazon, it&#x27;s worth it, I&#x27;ll die if they quit selling this fruit for my pits, I&#x27;m 30 and I&#x27;ll always have my teen spirit.</li>
    <li> My little child needed deodorant, and we bought all the natural stuff but were still not satisfied until I stumbled across teen spirit! We are very satisfied now....  It last all day and does not stain.</li>
    <li> Smells so good and fantastic price.  I think they&#x27;re discontinued, so I bought them here and in bulk!!  I have a stock pile.  If you mix this one with Teen Spirit Pink Crush, it smells like Nerds Candy.  YUMMY!,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 24 and bought it from amazon because I couldn&#x27;t find any in the stores in Yuma, Az.   It smells like a strawberry fruit roll up!! I LOVE IT!!! Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only heard good things about this deodorant. So one day, I decided to try it. At school, people kept walking up to me and saying \\&quot;that I smell like teen spirit.\\&quot; I was wondering what it meant, so I went home and looked it up on the internet. While it was loading (I have dial-up), I went over and sat on my bed and noticed that there was a blueish guitar, obviously for left-handed people, with some blood on it. I picked it up and played around with it. I got back to find out that my parents forgot to pay the phone bill so we didn&#x27;t have internet access. At school the next day, I felt like I was possessed, and during that time I unknowingly walked up to a guy named Krist and asked him to start a band, and showed him some unfamiliar demos of music I apparently recorded. He liked it, and one album and several years later I walked into my cluttered apartment and found that someone wrote in spraypaint, \\&quot;[my name] smells like teen spirit.\\&quot; I didn&#x27;t know what it meant, so I wrote a song about it and wrote twelve other songs and released the album. It made me millions and millions of dollars, and then I released another album two years later. We never came to a conclusion what the band should be named so we named it \\&quot;Happiness.\\&quot; in 1994 I shot myself and reincarnated, sixteen years later I wrote a review about it.    I highly recommend this deodorant.</li>
    <li> My daughter has been using this for close to 10 years.  She can&#x27;t find it in any store and refuses to try anything else.</li>
    <li> This deodorant has to be the most ideal one around. Fer those that don&#x27;t like that flowery crap like me. I love this stuff. But I can never find it in stores. It&#x27;s kinda a shame, or then again... Maybe it&#x27;s because everyone keeps buying them out!</li>
    <li> Exactly as i expected. Perfect product &amp; shipping was super fast(even over a holiday weekend). I love the smell of this deodorant(sweet strawberry) &amp; its getting harder &amp; harder to find it so this is perfect for me. I hate the smell of baby powder &amp; this has been one of those rare deodorants that doesn&#x27;t smell like it. Think candy strawberry in those red &amp; green foil wrappers.</li>
    <li> It arrived almost immediately and in time for my trip to Alaska.  They stopped carrying it in stores in my area....amazon had the best deal available out there!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s less dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;Here we are now, entertain us.&lt;br /&gt;I feel stupid, and contagious.&lt;br /&gt;Here we are now, entertain us.&lt;br /&gt;A mulatto, an albino, a mosquito, my libido.&lt;br /&gt;Yeah!</li>
    <li> She and her husband just loves the smell of this!!! She wore this when they were dating and then they stopped selling it in the store so she couldn&#x27;t find it. So thank God for amazon.com!!</li>
    <li> I have used this for years but it is so hard to find anymore and I hate to have to give it up</li>
    <li> I can never find this scent in stores where I live, so I always order it in bulk from this company</li>
    <li> Me, my mom, and sister are all adults and still love Teen Spirit! I cannot find it anywhere in stores so I always order these on Amazon. You get 6 in a pack which is awesome and they always come quickly. I would definitely recommend buying this</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I expected it to be. Love this product. It just sucks that I cant find it in stores anymore.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t sell this in my local stores anymore so I buy it online. NO, IM NOT A TEEN. But I still love the strength and scent of this deodorant so much that its all I use.</li>
