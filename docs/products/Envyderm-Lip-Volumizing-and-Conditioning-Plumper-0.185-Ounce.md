### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It feels and tastes great!</li>
      <li>This is an excellent gloss, but has no plumping effect.  </li>
      <li>(Which is wonderful!)</li>
      <li>It shimmers for a while and the effect on my lips is wonderful.  </li>
      <li>whatever it is, is great.</li>
      <li>and I believe, over time, it would work great for conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a great product for under lipstick or stand alone.</li>
      <li>It has great shine and pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>That can&#x27;t possibly be a good thing.  </li>
      <li>I loved the way my lips looked, and it does plump them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was equally impressed by the variety of colors available.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and get good results!</li>
      <li>It has a nice gloss to it and looks good on the lips.</li>
      <li>but my lips are already pretty awesome!</li>
      <li>I have tried every lip plumper on the market (no joke) and this is the best (besides pure cinnamon leaf oil, which burns like hell)</li>
      <li>I bought me a couple tubes since I liked the colors.</li>
      <li>(For my own amusement I will have to figure out a way to get the hubby to try the stick.)</li>
      <li>The packaging and stick look nice</li>
      <li>This lip plumper has a very strong mint smell.</li>
      <li>I wore it just on its own (although you could add it on top of a lip tint or lipstick).</li>
      <li>this conditioner is used to \\&quot;Apply to the lips on its own or over lipstick for sexy envious lips.\\&quot;  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Conclusion, if you want a nice shiny lip gloss with a bit of tingle that lasts &amp; lasts, you will probably love EnvyDerm.  </li>
      <li>The high shine is beautiful, but even vaseline can give that effect.  </li>
      <li>Although my lovely wife doesn&#x27;t need \\&quot;plumper\\&quot; lips, this product she thought would be fun to try and surprisingly she thinks it works.</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>Not horribly so, just a bit gummy.  </li>
      <li>but I have not yet been satisfied with one.  </li>
      <li>Genes are genes. :)</li>
      <li>This lip volumizing plumper has a lovely shine to it.</li>
      <li>This lip volumizing plumper has a lovely shine to it.</li>
      <li>Although I really liked this product because it looked really good on my lips, the problem I had with it is that it really is quite strong.</li>
      <li>I also like that there are more natural ingredients in this than most--and because of that, I&#x27;d say that this is a great moisturizing lip gloss.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried this at many different times--first thing in the morning (best results, since your lips are driest then), over lipstick (not bad--doesn&#x27;t come off right away), etc.</li>
      <li>It makes your lips feel cool, not burning or stinging!</li>
      <li>I use it after being out doors and it leaves my lips with a full, youthful appearance!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice and glossy, and it really looks pretty/sexy.</li>
      <li>I like this one because my hair doesn&#x27;t stick to it when the wind blows which is fairly important.</li>
      <li>As far as conditioning goes, I think it does a good job of hydrating my lips.</li>
      <li>This plumper is slightly better than most in that it is not as sticky (it still is somewhat) and while not being very moisturizing it is not drying.</li>
      <li>It gives a soft, pretty look and it makes my lips feel great.</li>
      <li>It has a nice light shimmer which I liked but not everyone may enjoy the constantly wet look.</li>
      <li>and they lowered the price significantly because there is no plumping effect.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say try it out if you&#x27;re on a search for a better plumper that doesn&#x27;t sting, but I wouldn&#x27;t promise sudden magical Angelina Jolie lips like that one reviewer does!</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s a pleasant minty feel similar to a medicated lip balm, but no stinging.</li>
      <li>this isn&#x27;t anything special.  </li>
      <li>First the packaging is attractive, the unique applicator makes applying this gloss mess and clump free!</li>
      <li>However, my lips are a \\&quot;bit fuller\\&quot; and most definitely are moisturized and more youthful looking</li>
      <li>, the gloss itself is super sticky.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Had it smelled and tasted better, or if it was obvious in its plumping ability, I would have enjoyed this product.</li>
      <li>Even though I love how it feels, I cannot give it a higher rating because it absolutely does not plump the lips.</li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a very good product--but not necessarily a wonder-product.</li>
      <li>Worth trying for anyone looking for a lip volumizing and conditioning item.  </li>
      <li>Also I love the fact that its also a treatment, cant wait to have a naturally plumped lips as I continue using it.</li>
      <li>My lips tend to dry easily but using this insures my lips stay moist and feel so much better.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a good product despite the lack of plumping obviousness for me, and I&#x27;d be interested in trying other shades.</li>
      <li>This is a very nice lip gloss, glides on, no burn (slight tingle), it is non-drying on my lips, but I don&#x27;t really see any \\&quot;plumping\\&quot; either.</li>
      <li>Great clear shimmer to wear alone or layer over other shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Tastes pretty good, dries quick enough to wear under lipstick or use like I did naked.</li>
      <li>This volumizer is very easy to apply but when my significant other tried she said it did not seem to make much difference in the way her lips looked.  </li>
      <li>Without feeling too sticky, my lips stay visibly glossy for significantly longer than with most other lip glosses.  </li>
      <li>As participants in Amazon&#x27;s Vine Program, this product -- Envyderm Lip Volumizing and Conditioning Plumper -- was tried for the first time.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different volumizing/plumping lip glosses.  </li>
      <li>I purchased the &#x27;clear&#x27;, and the shine and gloss element is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>There were certainly no ill effects</li>
      <li>/&gt;The first was the taste.</li>
      <li>It has a nice minty tingle (probably due to the mint oils used - spearmint and wintergreen), but it doesn&#x27;t burn or sting.</li>
      <li>There are equally effective sticks out there for half the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is probably the least pleasant one I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>but there was no dramatic impact either.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I would suggest just getting a decent lip gloss or lipstick with plumping ability and you&#x27;re all set!  </li>
      <li>The plumper added almost no difference whatsoever and the feeling on the lips isn&#x27;t very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>for volumizing, I didn&#x27;t really see any.</li>
      <li>It is very tingly; close to a burning sensation.  </li>
      <li>I really didn&#x27;t like</li>
      <li>It can be a real pain to get off of my drinking glass when I wash it.  </li>
      <li>you&#x27;re going to spend so much on basically, a lip gloss, you mighht want tone that lasts longer.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t tingle much and I can&#x27;t really say if it&#x27;s plumping my lips at all.</li>
      <li>but then I&#x27;ve never had much luck with these products so it may just be me.</li>
      <li>but I really don&#x27;t think the performance justifies the price.</li>
      <li>I hope I like the colored stuff as much as the clear!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The next day, my lips still felt smooth and</li>
      <li>Who wants to keep pulling your hair off of your mouth when out in nature.</li>
      <li>It does provide a slight difference in the plumpness and moisturizes nicely, but I can&#x27;t say that I can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this one, but I don&#x27;t think it has really done much for me.  </li>
      <li>The applicating wand is great, sort of bendy at the tip and slightly bigger than you usually see, making use a breeze.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Even if it doesn&#x27;t plump my lips to the full 37%, I still really like it and will definitely be adding it to my beauty bag.</li>
      <li>It has a very minty essence and your lips feel cool, but it definitely does not burn or sting.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure whether the plumping factor is really working - I can feel the tingle when I apply the gloss, but as far as I can tell my lips don&#x27;t look any more full.  </li>
      <li>, i got the clear its pretty and shimmers well.</li>
      <li>I applied a color that typically stays for HOURS, applied the plumper over top, and within just one hour, all of my color was gone.  </li>
      <li>main quibble with this product is the price point.</li>
      <li>So it feels nice, but doesn&#x27;t really plump (at least not noticably for me).</li>
      <li>I found it highly</li>
      <li>you don&#x27;t mind the tingling, then I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of lip volumizers or &#x27;plumpers&#x27; in the past, and this one certainly has a better feel than some others.  </li>
      <li>At first glance the price seems to be on the high side, however, when you consider the size of the product and how long it lasts, it really is quite</li>
      <li>It smells exactly like regular toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Once you have it on for a little while it&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>A clear plumping type lip</li>
      <li>So far this has happened with every color, so I can either just wear this over nude lips or splurge on a color version.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> From a woman who regularly uses high-quality makeup &amp; other cosmetics, let me say. . . this isn&#x27;t anything special.  Especially for $28!  The plumper added almost no difference whatsoever and the feeling on the lips isn&#x27;t very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would suggest just getting a decent lip gloss or lipstick with plumping ability and you&#x27;re all set!  You&#x27;ll also save $15!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this several times but can never really tell if it&#x27;s plumping or not. It tingles like other lip volumizers I&#x27;ve used but then I&#x27;ve never had much luck with these products so it may just be me. It has a nice gloss to it and looks good on the lips. I&#x27;ve seen some 5-star reviews here so it must be working for some.</li>
    <li> Although I really liked this product because it looked really good on my lips, the problem I had with it is that it really is quite strong. It made my lips tingle and feel numb when I first put it on. Once you have it on for a little while it&#x27;s fine. The tingling sensation does go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, this product can be worn over lipstick or by itself on your lips. Putting a lipstick underneath does help you avoid the tingling sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the shine? It&#x27;s nice and glossy, and it really looks pretty/sexy. I loved the way my lips looked, and it does plump them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t mind the tingling, then I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice lip gloss, glides on, no burn (slight tingle), it is non-drying on my lips, but I don&#x27;t really see any \\&quot;plumping\\&quot; either. I do like the way it shines and conditions without being sticky, but as I don&#x27;t see the plump, I think the price is a little hard to justify.</li>
    <li> Wow, I was pleasantly surprised by EnvyDerm. First the packaging is attractive, the unique applicator makes applying this gloss mess and clump free! *(Which is wonderful!) I have used the product daily for 6 weeks (multiple applications throughout the day) and I can&#x27;t say I have achieved Angelina Jolie lips, but I didn&#x27;t expect such a radical transformation from a lip gloss. However, my lips are a \\&quot;bit fuller\\&quot; and most definitely are moisturized and more youthful looking and I couldn&#x27;t be happier about the results. It exceeds anything that I have gotten from similar products. (And I&#x27;ve tried several.) I was equally impressed by the variety of colors available. Last we have to talk about the price. At first glance the price seems to be on the high side, however, when you consider the size of the product and how long it lasts, it really is quite affordable.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use EnvyDerm Gloss and plan to order the Mascara and Liner.</li>
    <li> its a lip gloss, but i would never use it as a lip plump, i got the clear its pretty and shimmers well. but not as lip plump, no way,</li>
    <li> The product did make my lips look fuller and I believe, over time, it would work great for conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there were things I didn&#x27;t like, which prevented me from giving it that time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first was the taste. It reminded me of the goop the dentist puts into your mouth to help numb it right before the shot. Only with this product, that taste sticks around a lot longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second was the tingly, numb feeling this product caused on my lips--again, reminiscent of a trip to the dentist. I found it highly unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone who might be considering kissing someone. I am fairly certain the bad sensations would be transferred. I cannot imagine any man wanting to kiss any woman who&#x27;s wearing this goop.</li>
    <li> I have tried every lip plumper on the market (no joke) and this is the best (besides pure cinnamon leaf oil, which burns like hell) I bought me a couple tubes since I liked the colors. I was not expecting it to work as well as it did. Now it is all I use on my lips! It makes your lips feel cool, not burning or stinging! Also I love the fact that its also a treatment, cant wait to have a naturally plumped lips as I continue using it.</li>
    <li> I was a little afraid that this would look too Bonne Bell when I saw how sparkly the tube was, but it actually goes in with a nice shimmer and not tons of sparkle. Great clear shimmer to wear alone or layer over other shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for volumizing, I didn&#x27;t really see any. It&#x27;s just about as minty as Bert&#x27;s Bees. So it feels nice, but doesn&#x27;t really plump (at least not noticably for me). I do like the applicator (sort of a cross between a brush and a q-tip style).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging looks clinical, which is odd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found it to be sort of a matte gloss. Not sticky to things like my hair, but a bit sticky when rubbing my lips together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good product despite the lack of plumping obviousness for me, and I&#x27;d be interested in trying other shades. This&#x27;ll stay in my rotation!</li>
    <li> I added a photo collage featuring day one before application &amp; after application to one week before application &amp; after application showing there is no noticeable difference in lip volume after using EnvyDerm.  After 2.5 months of use there is still no visible change in my lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it is ineffective at lip plumping (I have yet to find a product that actually works regarding lip plumping), it lasts much longer then all of my other lip products.  It is very tingly; close to a burning sensation.  The tingling does not bother me, but the smell is a little off putting.  It smells exactly like regular toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EnvyDerm claims it is not sticky. It is sticky.  Not horribly so, just a bit gummy.  So don&#x27;t expect it to be slick &amp; smooth.  It can be a real pain to get off of my drinking glass when I wash it.  I guess all that sticky is why it lasts so long on the lips; the tingle also lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars because I like how it makes my lips tingle/feel, it lasts much longer than other lip products &amp; it has some organic ingredients.  Even though I love how it feels, I cannot give it a higher rating because it absolutely does not plump the lips. It took me 2.5 months to use the entire tube &amp; I can tell you that my lips look no different.  I used it every day, all day long.  I have since placed an order for a new tube in Pale Peachy Nude.  I hope I like the colored stuff as much as the clear!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion, if you want a nice shiny lip gloss with a bit of tingle that lasts &amp; lasts, you will probably love EnvyDerm.  If you are looking for a lip plumper, you will be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for under lipstick or stand alone. I use it after being out doors and it leaves my lips with a full, youthful appearance! It feels and tastes great!</li>
    <li> I have used assorted lip plumpers over the years and generally find them to be tingly, sticky and occasionally drying. Any plumping effect is short term and due mainly to irritation. This plumper is slightly better than most in that it is not as sticky (it still is somewhat) and while not being very moisturizing it is not drying. I expected the initial tingling sensation and did not mind it, my daughter (who does not need plumping) tried the stick out and thought the initial sensation was unpleasant. (For my own amusement I will have to figure out a way to get the hubby to try the stick.) As for plumping, there was a moderate effect which lasted less than an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main quibble with this product is the price point. The packaging and stick look nice but I really don&#x27;t think the performance justifies the price. There are equally effective sticks out there for half the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not Recommended.</li>
    <li> I like this plumper--as advertised, there&#x27;s no burning, which is why I would always quit using other similar products. There&#x27;s a pleasant minty feel similar to a medicated lip balm, but no stinging. I also like that there are more natural ingredients in this than most--and because of that, I&#x27;d say that this is a great moisturizing lip gloss. But I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s better than other plumpers, other than that it hydrates your lips when they&#x27;re dry, which makes them a bit fuller. I&#x27;ve tried this at many different times--first thing in the morning (best results, since your lips are driest then), over lipstick (not bad--doesn&#x27;t come off right away), etc. Overall, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a very good product--but not necessarily a wonder-product. I&#x27;m surprised to see others saying it had a dramatic effect on their lips. I&#x27;d say try it out if you&#x27;re on a search for a better plumper that doesn&#x27;t sting, but I wouldn&#x27;t promise sudden magical Angelina Jolie lips like that one reviewer does! Genes are genes. :)</li>
    <li> Although my lovely wife doesn&#x27;t need \\&quot;plumper\\&quot; lips, this product she thought would be fun to try and surprisingly she thinks it works.</li>
    <li> This lip volumizing plumper has a lovely shine to it. Unfortunately, it has a very strong medicinal smell to it, which I don&#x27;t like at all. It also makes my lips tingle. As the cons outweighed the pros for me, I decided not to use this product after all.</li>
    <li> When I originally purchased this item I expected it to be typical lip balm but was I ever surprised.  It shimmers for a while and the effect on my lips is wonderful.  I can&#x27;t identify the taste but whatever it is, is great. My lips tend to dry easily but using this insures my lips stay moist and feel so much better.  Once I&#x27;ve used up this product I would like to purchase a different flavor next time and possibly a deeper color as well.  On a scale of 1-10, I&#x27;d rank this lip product a definite 10!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of lip volumizers or &#x27;plumpers&#x27; in the past, and this one certainly has a better feel than some others.  I purchased the &#x27;clear&#x27;, and the shine and gloss element is fantastic.  Without feeling too sticky, my lips stay visibly glossy for significantly longer than with most other lip glosses.  I&#x27;m not sure whether the plumping factor is really working - I can feel the tingle when I apply the gloss, but as far as I can tell my lips don&#x27;t look any more full.  That being said, I&#x27;m very much enjoying this product as a simple coat of shine for everyday wear.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent gloss, but has no plumping effect.  I think that people may see an effect where there is none.  The high shine is beautiful, but even vaseline can give that effect.  The menthol used was irritating to me because it is awful for chapped lips.  It seriously burns and the burning sensation lasts for a long time.  When my lips weren&#x27;t dry it still had an annoying tingly effect that I didn&#x27;t find beneficial in any way.  I have found that products that want to convince you that they are \\&quot;working\\&quot; have similar effects.  I even slept in it a couple of times to see if that would produce any results and it didn&#x27;t.  The only thing that made my lips look any different was the glossy shine and any high shine gloss can have that effect.  I can see myself buying this only if it didn&#x27;t have the menthol and they lowered the price significantly because there is no plumping effect.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> A clear plumping type lip product.&lt;br /&gt;The plumping comes from the usual  ingredients that make lips sting/tingle slightly.&lt;br /&gt;Gloss is thick, so I think that accounts for the very slight plumping effect.</li>
    <li> This lip volumizing plumper has a lovely shine to it. Unfortunately, it has a very strong medicinal smell to it, which I don&#x27;t like at all. It also makes my lips tingle. As the cons outweighed the pros for me, I decided not to use this product after all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it plumps, but it tingles and it makes you feel as though it&#x27;s doing something. Ha! It has great shine and pleasant smell. It smells slightly minty and it definitely moisturizers your lips. And there is a lot of it -0.18 fl. oz.  It&#x27;s the largest lip gloss I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> This lip plumper has a very strong mint smell. The taste is worse. It doesn&#x27;t tingle much and I can&#x27;t really say if it&#x27;s plumping my lips at all. They appear a little darker pink, rather that bigger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a thick gloss and it stayed on my lips well. It has a nice light shimmer which I liked but not everyone may enjoy the constantly wet look. The applicating wand is great, sort of bendy at the tip and slightly bigger than you usually see, making use a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had it smelled and tasted better, or if it was obvious in its plumping ability, I would have enjoyed this product. Unfortunately for the price, it&#x27;s just not worth it. I&#x27;ve found the same results with less taste with the Avon brand for less than a third of the price.</li>
    <li> As participants in Amazon&#x27;s Vine Program, this product -- Envyderm Lip Volumizing and Conditioning Plumper -- was tried for the first time.  It met our expectations.  As advertised on Amazon&#x27;s website... this conditioner is used to \\&quot;Apply to the lips on its own or over lipstick for sexy envious lips.\\&quot;  Worth trying for anyone looking for a lip volumizing and conditioning item.  Easy to use and get good results!</li>
    <li> I have used 2 different lib volumizing products and the other really stung when you put it on. They both work about the same (in other words not much difference) but I still feel as if there is a bit of a change so I do use it when going out. I like this one because my hair doesn&#x27;t stick to it when the wind blows which is fairly important. Who wants to keep pulling your hair off of your mouth when out in nature.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only tried one other lip plumping product before and never again until now because as soon as I put it on, my lips felt like they were on fire!  That can&#x27;t possibly be a good thing.  Anyway, when I read the description that there was no burning sensation and it was not sticky I thought, why not?  Overall, this product is as advertised, however the gloss is very thick and sticky, but it penetrates and absorbs in about 5 minutes.  It has a very minty essence and your lips feel cool, but it definitely does not burn or sting.  It does provide a slight difference in the plumpness and moisturizes nicely, but I can&#x27;t say that I can&#x27;t live without it.  Aside from 5 minutes of that goopy sensation, it&#x27;s not a bad product, it&#x27;s just not innovative either.</li>
    <li> It tingles when you use it, and it conditions the lips. I didn&#x27;t notice any volumizing going on but my lips are already pretty awesome! :)  Tastes pretty good, dries quick enough to wear under lipstick or use like I did naked.</li>
    <li> I have notoriously thin lips and have used a variety of different products to \\&quot;pump\\&quot; them up but I have not yet been satisfied with one.  I had high hopes for this one, but I don&#x27;t think it has really done much for me.  Yes, I got the \\&quot;tingling\\&quot; sensation common to these pumping concoctions, but I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference in size.  My lips WERE more noticeable, but this was due to the fact that they were shiny enough to perhaps be used as a mirror, or at least as a signaling device for long-distance communications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I really didn&#x27;t like was that it killed any other product I applied it over.  I have had clear plumpers in the past that I used over other lip colors and had hoped to be able to do that with this one.  I applied a color that typically stays for HOURS, applied the plumper over top, and within just one hour, all of my color was gone.  So far this has happened with every color, so I can either just wear this over nude lips or splurge on a color version.</li>
    <li> Keep in mind, I have not tried this product on myself, personally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, my girlfriend has been using it and unfortunately she believes it does not add volume to lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She likes it as a gloss, but is disappointed by it&#x27;s staying power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re going to spend so much on basically, a lip gloss, you mighht want tone that lasts longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plumping value of this gloss is nil.</li>
    <li> This volumizer is very easy to apply but when my significant other tried she said it did not seem to make much difference in the way her lips looked.  There were certainly no ill effects but there was no dramatic impact either.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a few different lip plumpers in the past, and this one is probably my favorite. It has a nice minty tingle (probably due to the mint oils used - spearmint and wintergreen), but it doesn&#x27;t burn or sting. I wore it just on its own (although you could add it on top of a lip tint or lipstick). As far as conditioning goes, I think it does a good job of hydrating my lips. The next day, my lips still felt smooth and hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice a dramatic plumping of my lips, but they did look nice, I feel like the ingredients stimulated my lips and increased blood flow. The shimmery clear gives lips a nice glossy look without that nasty sticky gloss feel. It might take using it a few weeks longer to see the full conditioning/plumping results. Even if it doesn&#x27;t plump my lips to the full 37%, I still really like it and will definitely be adding it to my beauty bag. It gives a soft, pretty look and it makes my lips feel great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different volumizing/plumping lip glosses.  This is probably the least pleasant one I&#x27;ve tried.  Instead of the usual tingling sensation, this one down-right stung.  It did plump slightly, but I didn&#x27;t notice any more of an effect than other similar products that don&#x27;t sting so bad, so in my opinion, it isn&#x27;t worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the gloss itself is super sticky.  I can&#x27;t stand sticky lip glosses.  I won&#x27;t be purchasing or using this product again.</li>
