      <li>exactly what I needed</li>
      <li>For the money, if you don&#x27;t mind gloves that are thin and tear easily, then it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
      <li>Had to get large.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t protect the hands very well for this purpose.  </li>
      <li>When putting these gloves on, don&#x27;t yank them on expecting them to stretch as the material doesn&#x27;t have that much give.  </li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m disabled and supply my own gloves to my PCA&#x27;s, so this a steal of a deal.</li>
      <li>This isnt the first time we have used them and wont be the last.</li>
      <li>I have used these first, as a caregiver for my wife, then just to use for various things to protect my hands.</li>
      <li>I ordered the Invacare brand previously and I was satisfied by the quality of the vinyl gloves but my re-order arrived in a generic brand which contained  thinner vinyl gloves.</li>
      <li>the fit on they is not too tight.</li>
      <li>so it is no big deal at all.&lt;br /&gt;These are not tight at wrist and it is not an issue since I did not buy them as tight fitting gloves or as a&lt;br /&gt;fashion statement these are for getting dirty and they are great.</li>
      <li>the price paid for these gloves is stellar, They are useful they are not top notch gloves</li>

      <li>on.&lt;br /&gt;The company insists that the gloves are the exact same gloves and just a different company name now, therefore box is different.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I bought these gloves for general household use.  </li>
      <li>Gloves have large gap around the wrist and they are very thin and break easy.  </li>
      <li>Gloves are different than ones shown and our home aides (all of them) complained that they fit different and were more difficult to put</li>

    <li> exactly what I needed</li>
    <li> Not  Invacare brand as advertized, but the substitute was fine.</li>
    <li> Good product! Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Much better price than in the drugstores or superstores. We use a lot of gloves, and could not be more pleased with the service, price, and convenience.</li>
    <li> I used this to clean my cat litter and it serve the purpose.  I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> Wow, how do you review rubber gloves?  Seem to be of good quality.  Prompt service.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> I use this to care for my bedridden mother.  Since I&#x27;m allergic to latex this is a great option for me.</li>
    <li> The gloves are not Invacare, and though they&#x27;re called medium, they are tight on my small hands.  However, they are good quality otherwise and were delivered quickly. I tried to ask them about the size but received no reply.</li>
    <li> Product was exactly what I had ordered, arrived quickly and in good condition. No hassles, good price, and will happy to buy from this company in the future.</li>
    <li> Excellent gloves. Excellent price. Short shipping time</li>
    <li> quick delivery... good product</li>
    <li> I have used these first, as a caregiver for my wife, then just to use for various things to protect my hands. This company is consistently reliable and efficient in providing them at a good price.</li>
    <li> Gloves have large gap around the wrist and they are very thin and break easy.  Don&#x27;t try scooping cat boxes with these if you have fingernails. They&#x27;ll break right through.  Otherwise, might be okay for cleaning up.  They don&#x27;t protect the hands very well for this purpose.  For the money, if you don&#x27;t mind gloves that are thin and tear easily, then it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Invacare brand previously and I was satisfied by the quality of the vinyl gloves but my re-order arrived in a generic brand which contained  thinner vinyl gloves. I was disappointed and was about to return the shipment but had no choice but to use them as I ran out of gloves to use in my care facility. I will never order from this supplier again. They have fraudulent advertising utilizing bait and switch dirty tactics. This supplier should be banned by Amazon if they care about their reputation. If I could give zero stars, I ll give them this rating. This supplier has absolutely disgusting practices. Buyers, BEWARE iIN DEALING WITH THIS UNSCRUPULOUS SUPPLIER.  I would like Amazon to do something about this and I will be waiting for their action.</li>
    <li> I too as another customer stated in another review  ordered Invacare gloves which I would rate as 5 stars but they sent me reliamed brand instead. Reliamed is 1 star compared to Invacare. I have no idea why they do this???????????!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I wear vinyl gloves when I am using cleaning products and painting.&lt;br /&gt;Formerly I bought the gloves at the drugstore. Once I saw these, I was happy to try them. They are perfect for my needs. The fit is good and the duration time, good. Not to mention, cost is very good.</li>
    <li> They were not Invacare brand. Fit was not great</li>
    <li> The gloves are just what I needed for the home health care of my mother who has a colostomy. The price was good and the delivery fast. The product does what I need it to. They do not tear like some gloves I have gotten in the past.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m disabled and supply my own gloves to my PCA&#x27;s, so this a steal of a deal. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> My mother is in a health care facility where the staff uses gloves for everything.  Supplying gloves instead of paying the per box cost at the facility saves lots of money and the quality is just as good.</li>
    <li> Arrived before estimated due date.  These gloves work great.</li>
    <li> good quality, speedy delivery</li>
    <li> I ordered Invacare gloves which I would rate as 5 stars but they sent me reliamed brand instead. Reliamed is 1 star compared to Invacare</li>
    <li> These are tough, but do not tear easliy.  I use them for arts and crafts, as well as medical applications and cleaning.  Also, no allergic reactions as with latex.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product!  Fast delivery! Thanks very much!!</li>
    <li> Was looking for an affordable glove for household cleaning.  They hold up to most of the routine household cleaning chores.</li>
    <li> The gloves we received were not really Invacare (according to the box), but they are of comparable quality.</li>
    <li> A little to small. Had to get large.</li>
    <li> Always satisfied. Thanks for remaining consistent with your service!</li>
    <li> was worried they might not be so good because of the price, but I was happy that assumption was incorrect.  These have worked great for me around the shop.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Good product at a good price</li>
    <li> I take care of elderly person. I need good quality vinyl gloves at affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;These gloves fully satisfy my expectation. I recommend this product and the seller as well!</li>
    <li> these gloves were thicker than the previous ones I had ordered.  The price was good,  I would tell anyone, this is a&lt;br /&gt;bargain.</li>
    <li> Great product and provides the protection my wife needs.</li>
    <li> the price paid for these gloves is stellar, They are useful they are not top notch gloves but they are not complete crap either.</li>
    <li> Great quality for the price</li>
    <li> these gloves are functional. They work well for home health aids, or caregivers. the fit on they is not too tight.</li>
    <li> Gloves are different than ones shown and our home aides (all of them) complained that they fit different and were more difficult to put on.&lt;br /&gt;The company insists that the gloves are the exact same gloves and just a different company name now, therefore box is different.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I just don&#x27;t believe it.</li>
    <li> Just as described. A great find at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> I bought these gloves for general household use.  I use them to protect myself while working with stuff I don&#x27;t want to touch like lye when making homemade soap.  I also use them at night sometimes while I sleep to treat dry hands and eczema.  I oil up my hands and keep them in the gloves overnight.  I&#x27;ve also used them for picking up dog poop or other gross tasks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I work as a nurse, so I have used many different types of gloves.  The purple ones I use at work are generally nicer, stretchier and have a better fit with longer more snug wrist coverage.  The purple gloves are also more expensive which is why I chose these.  When putting these gloves on, don&#x27;t yank them on expecting them to stretch as the material doesn&#x27;t have that much give.  Once they are on, they are durable, thick and protective.  I plan to order more when my large supply runs out as they suit my needs very well and the price is good.</li>
    <li> Gloves are very good. This isnt the first time we have used them and wont be the last. And they are very reasonable. Mo</li>
    <li> I use these gloves when washing dishes or any other time that I am using soap to protect my hands as i have eczema. They are a good quality and I will buy them again.</li>
    <li> For all around general work in greenhouse, garden, car, plumbing and any filthy job you may have these are&lt;br /&gt;a smoking good deal. A few have busted as I pull them on but that can happen with any glove so it is no big deal at all.&lt;br /&gt;These are not tight at wrist and it is not an issue since I did not buy them as tight fitting gloves or as a&lt;br /&gt;fashion statement these are for getting dirty and they are great.</li>
    <li> Not the Expected Quality Invacare Brand as Advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have used the Invacare Brand Vinyl Gloves many years, and this is not it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality is lacking and the sizing is somewhat larger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will not reorder.</li>
    <li> Good quality vinyl gloves.  Not too thin.  Shipped quickly.</li>
