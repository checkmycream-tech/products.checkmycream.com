### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is the best eyebrow pencil I have ever used.</li>
      <li>And the best part is that there&#x27;s NO reddish/auburn cast to the color!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy to say that I found it on Amazon!</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>and i think its great.</li>
      <li>So glad to find this color perfect for me</li>
      <li>Being a woman of colour, the colour fit my skin complexion perfectly.</li>
      <li>Okay, this Rimmel eyebrow pencil sharpens so neatly and pointy!</li>
      <li>The brush head on the lid comes in handy when blending and shading in areas.</li>
      <li>I have lost most of my eyebrows and need to pencil in some &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; eyebrow hair.</li>
      <li>I love this eyebrow pencil.</li>
      <li>8-)</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>Have used this pencil for over 2 years... love it.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Update: I have since moved on to eyebrow powder which is sooo much better.</li>
      <li>I have been using Rimmel eyebrow pencil for years, and it is not always easy to find.  </li>
      <li>use this by lightly shaping/ filling in my brows, and use the Anastasia #12 brush to blend everything out.</li>
      <li>For me, keeping the end dull, and using a light hand yields the best results.</li>
      <li>I lost part of my eyebrow hair and was searching for a good eyebrow liner to disguise it while it grows back.</li>
      <li>I wish it was all natural but in the end I needed something that was easy to apply, would stay in place and was easy to sharpen.</li>
      <li>This eyebrow liner is a good consistency - not too waxy and not too dry.</li>
      <li>Great buy, I use this everyday</li>
      <li>I like these pencils very much.</li>
      <li>i have a lot of brow to begin with though, i only use this to fill in sparse areas and to lengthen the ends of my brows, as well as create a more defined look.</li>
      <li>being a person  here who lives in the humid hot weather city of South Texas.</li>
      <li>It is a good color for my black hair because it doesn&#x27;t make my eyebrows look too intense.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely need this color eyebrow pencil...</li>
      <li>I really like the color and the brush.</li>
      <li>These pencils, particularly in the darker colors hold a point much longer.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The color is perfect, but for some reason it&#x27;s impossible to find anywhere in stores.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, the pencils I bought were old and had been in too much heat.</li>
      <li>With this liner on, people have been surprised when I told them what happened because with the liner I can create hair-like, very fine lines so the hairless area goes largely unnoticed unless you were to look for it.</li>
      <li>Applies precise lines in a hard-to-find dark brown color.</li>
      <li>The application stays on the eyebrows a long time and the color  &amp;#34;black brown&amp;#34; is perfect for my natural colored black, thick curly hair.</li>
      <li>It really looks natural and not obvious that it was drawn on.</li>
      <li>It gives a natural finish that doesn&#x27;t look drawn on, and lasts until you take it off.</li>
      <li>i do not use it to draw on a complete brow or anything like that.</li>
      <li>This is the only brow pencil that looks natural and not a drawn-on look.  </li>
      <li>I ended up using my old blender because this one didnt do the job well enough.</li>
      <li>and i&#x27;m only barely halfway through the pencil</li>

    <li> Update: I have since moved on to eyebrow powder which is sooo much better. The rimmel pencil would fade after a time and I think it was contributing to my eyebrows getting sparse! Since I switched I no longer feel like I&#x27;m losing my eyebrows! I would no longer recommend the rimmel pencil for that reason. Also I realized it looked slightly red in the daylight. Ugh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review:  i bought this in dark brown a few years ago and i&#x27;m only barely halfway through the pencil and i think its great. i have a lot of brow to begin with though, i only use this to fill in sparse areas and to lengthen the ends of my brows, as well as create a more defined look. i do not use it to draw on a complete brow or anything like that. for my purposes i like it. For me, keeping the end dull, and using a light hand yields the best results.</li>
    <li> This is the only pencil I will use for my eyebrows. I love it.</li>
    <li> I love this eyebrow pencil. Being a woman of colour, the colour fit my skin complexion perfectly. The brush head on the lid comes in handy when blending and shading in areas. Throughout the day, the colour doesn&#x27;t fade and stays the same. Overall I wouldnt definately recommend this product. Love it</li>

    <li> This is of the very, very few black-brown brow pencils that is actually dark enough for my almost-black ash brown eyebrows. And the best part is that there&#x27;s NO reddish/auburn cast to the color!  A close-to-perfect shade, finally.  8-)</li>
    <li> As I have aged, my eyebrows have begun to thin.  This is the only brow pencil that looks natural and not a drawn-on look.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I have at least a dozen brow products, both high-end and drugstore, but I keep coming back to this one. The color is perfect, but for some reason it&#x27;s impossible to find anywhere in stores. I&#x27;ve tried the &amp;#34;Dark Brown&amp;#34; one also, but it&#x27;s way too red in tone for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this by lightly shaping/ filling in my brows, and use the Anastasia #12 brush to blend everything out. It gives a natural finish that doesn&#x27;t look drawn on, and lasts until you take it off. Don&#x27;t bother with the &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; that&#x27;s attached to the cap, it does nothing.</li>
    <li> I have been using Rimmel eyebrow pencil for years, and it is not always easy to find.  Instead of driving all over town I&#x27;m happy to say that I found it on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Great buy, I use this everyday</li>
    <li> This is the best eyebrow pencil I have ever used. It never smudges! ....being a person  here who lives in the humid hot weather city of South Texas. The Anastasia wood pencil would smudge with humid weather! Okay, this Rimmel eyebrow pencil sharpens so neatly and pointy! The application stays on the eyebrows a long time and the color  &amp;#34;black brown&amp;#34; is perfect for my natural colored black, thick curly hair.</li>
    <li> I wish it was all natural but in the end I needed something that was easy to apply, would stay in place and was easy to sharpen.</li>
    <li> This eyebrow liner is a good consistency - not too waxy and not too dry. Applies precise lines in a hard-to-find dark brown color. I lost part of my eyebrow hair and was searching for a good eyebrow liner to disguise it while it grows back. With this liner on, people have been surprised when I told them what happened because with the liner I can create hair-like, very fine lines so the hairless area goes largely unnoticed unless you were to look for it.</li>
    <li> Dont bear down too hard and use very short strokes. I am a blue- eyed blonde who has greyed. My brows are salt and pepper. This pencil fixes that problem. Takes a couple yrs off!</li>
    <li> So glad to find this color perfect for me</li>
    <li> I really like the color and the brush. It really looks natural and not obvious that it was drawn on.</li>
    <li> I like these pencils very much. I have lost most of my eyebrows and need to pencil in some &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; eyebrow hair. This involves a very sharp point and lots of sharpening. These pencils, particularly in the darker colors hold a point much longer.&lt;br /&gt;However, the pencils I bought were old and had been in too much heat. They were melted out the end of the pencil. When I sharpen, there are gaps because of that. I lost a lot of product. That is disappointing.</li>
    <li> I absolutely need this color eyebrow pencil...black/brown...because the blacks on the market are way too dark and the brown&#x27;s don&#x27;t suit me because my hair is salt and pepper gray....my sister can use the browns because she dyes her hair various shades of brunette/auburn...I buy them two at a time because they are hard to find @ the drug / grocery stores..</li>
