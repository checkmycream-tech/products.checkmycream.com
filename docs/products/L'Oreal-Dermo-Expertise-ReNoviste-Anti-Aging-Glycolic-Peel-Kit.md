### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It works great!  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s why this peel is so great; it gets rid of your rising zits and speeds up recovery without a scar!</li>
      <li>In my opinion, I&#x27;d stay away from products with these ingredients, use something gentler like me, and use the peel once or twice a week for best results.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased!  </li>
      <li>This is a great product.</li>
      <li>I am happy to know I can still get it.</li>
      <li>Feels great on your face but doesn&#x27;t do a darn thing.</li>
      <li>It makes a huge diference in my skin!!!</li>
      <li>This product is very effective and works against the seborrheic keratosis</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
      <li>Good results, long-lasting.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 47 and get tons of people asking me how I keep my skin looking so good.</li>
      <li>This product gives a safe peel at home with great results.</li>
      <li>I love this product and was so happy to find this as I couldn&#x27;t find this in stores.  </li>
      <li>Still it leaves the skin with a nice glow and it feels good while using it.</li>
      <li>My skin looks amazing after using it.  </li>
      <li>I have never gone to a dermatologist to receive a professional peel, but if I am seeing nice results from this already I am very happy that I am not paying dermatologist prices!  </li>
      <li>I use to be able to find this product anywhere.  </li>
      <li>The more I use it, the better my skin looks.</li>
      <li>So glad I found it online.  </li>
      <li>Works as well as the $70.00 gycolic peel from Sephora--maybe even better.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I love the L&#x27;Oreal anti-aging Glycolic Peel Kit (the one pictured) but what I received was the Mini Peel Kit, which I do not care for.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for some time and am satisfied with the results.</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>You&#x27;re better off purchasing Glytone&#x27;s starter glycolic acid.  </li>
      <li>It is important for your skin to get used to the product - making sure to follow the directions.</li>
      <li>I  use to buy it at Wal-mart for years and used it about two to three times a year, then one day it wasn&#x27;t available anymore.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been so fortunate (not) to develop around my hairline now that I am in my sixties.</li>
      <li>I thought this product was a great way to get started on facial peels before going to a higher percentage of glycolic acid.  </li>
      <li>The lotion is especially great because it&#x27;s the only face lotion I&#x27;ve ever bought where a tiny dab of the product can easily be spread across my entire face, so I don&#x27;t have to rub it in forever or use a huge glob that will clog my pores.</li>
      <li>It can give you a fresh slate with or without make up.</li>
      <li>I love this product,  makes my 45 year old sun damaged skin glow.</li>
      <li>I use to get so many compliments back when I used it.</li>
      <li>Women would stare at me and finally apologize saying they couldn&#x27;t help noticing my healthy looking skin and complextion.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t use exactly as directed but trust me there&#x27;d be no difference if you followed the steps to a T.</li>
      <li>However, after couple of full face treatments, developed a sore rash around eyes, redness and inflamation.</li>
      <li>This product gives your skin a fresh, clean rosy glow( but not red and irritaed).</li>
      <li>Glycolic (at a safe for home-use level) itself is non-irritating and will not redden or hurt most people&#x27;s skin (even including my overly-sensitive skin), but the peel is helping you to shed pore-clogging dead skin and speed up the turnover of cells, so it&#x27;s not something you even need to use everyday because the cycle of healthy skin growth needs to occur in between uses.</li>
      <li>Shhhh its a secret, but happy for you to know</li>
      <li>Just beaware when you buying some of these kind of products which may or may not fit for all</li>
      <li>Love this stuff, makes the appearance of large pores smaller and only takes 5 minutes.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and rosacea, but I find this product gentle and not irritating.  </li>
      <li>If you can find it; I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t believe the peel is strong enough for me personally.</li>
      <li>Since I have used it before, I knew I liked it, but the actual product I bought seemed like it had been on a shelf for a few years.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this to anyone, even young women in their twenties.</li>
      <li>I have fine lines and they seem to be less noticable as well.</li>
      <li>I started using this product several years ago and was able to find it at any corner drug store,now, I can only find it on-line, I actually thought Loreal stopped making it.  </li>
      <li>It feels a little greasy or watery at first, like all lotion, but it is absorbed within a minute or two without leaving a greasy sheen.</li>
      <li>The item description said brand new, but the product that arrived at my doorstep was clearly used.</li>
      <li>I am going back to my doctor to get the real thing.</li>
      <li>So, I still do use a daily acne facial wash in the shower every day, even on days I use the peel, to try to stop break outs; I always perform the peel as soon as I get out of the shower because you want your pores to be open and your skin clean, per the instructions in the box.</li>
      <li>Salicylic and benzoyle peroxide dry out and irritate my skin badly, leading me to break out even more as a result; plus, both can make your skin more sensitive to the sun, leading to an increase in melanin and leading to darker acne scars.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not strong enough to see a difference in pigmentation, exfoliation or fine lines.  </li>
      <li>I have noticed a considerable decrease in my pore size and overall texture!  </li>
      <li>I suggest you do use a similar product; I currently use a new Noxema anti-bacterial wash (the active ingredient starts with a T, I believe).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sad that this product is no longer available, but I&#x27;m definitely going to look for similar products from L&#x27;Oreal, especially because they seem to like to have a complete package, not just the peel.  </li>

<li> Few days later worse, face hot and burning, rash progressed down face.</li>

<li> Needless to say, I sent the product back, but Impossible Discounts refused to give a full refund of my purchase total.</li>
<li> I do leave it on a little longer than they suggest...  </li>
<li> It might not fit for some skins.</li>
<li> I found it on Amazon a few weeks ago and ordered it again.</li>
<li> Also, there&#x27;s a lot of product here considering the seemingly small package.</li>
<li> I usually use it at least once a week, and if I&#x27;m breaking out at all, the product usually brings the zit to a head and gets rid of all traces of it within two days.</li>
<li> You&#x27;ll at least feel a tingle with that!</li>
<li> Unfortunately; I cannot&lt;br /&gt;find</li>
<li> It had a weird smell that did not seem &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34;.</li>
<li> I caution anyone who plans to do business with Impossible Discounts.</li>
<li> Eyes became painful.   </li>
<li> Impossible Discounts is a horrible company to deal with.</li>
<li> Im very disappointed in the product.</li>
<li> The L&#x27;oreal Dermo-Expertise kit they sent me was disgusting.</li>
<li> This company has zero integrity and horrible customer service.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This stuff is amazing! I leave it on longer than the directions say and never had any adverse reaction. It makes a huge diference in my skin!!! I swear by this stuff.</li>
    <li> I want this all for myself.  I love this product and was so happy to find this as I couldn&#x27;t find this in stores.  Plese don&#x27;t buy this, I want it all for myself.  I notice an immediate difference in my skin after using--complexion is brighter.  Works as well as the $70.00 gycolic peel from Sephora--maybe even better.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for some time and am satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> I started using this product several years ago and was able to find it at any corner drug store,now, I can only find it on-line, I actually thought Loreal stopped making it.  After running out I tried a much more expensive brand, Dr. Murad, with the same results, but at $180, so this is a bargain!  So glad I found it online.  It works great!  I&#x27;m 47 and get tons of people asking me how I keep my skin looking so good.</li>
    <li> I like this product but I don&#x27;t believe the peel is strong enough for me personally. I am used to getting stronger peels at salons. Still it leaves the skin with a nice glow and it feels good while using it.</li>

    <li> I have sensitive skin and rosacea, but I find this product gentle and not irritating.  Did not exacerbate the rosacea at all!  Good results, long-lasting.</li>
    <li> I  use to buy it at Wal-mart for years and used it about two to three times a year, then one day it wasn&#x27;t available anymore. I found it on Amazon a few weeks ago and ordered it again. I am happy to know I can still get it. This product gives your skin a fresh, clean rosy glow( but not red and irritaed). I use to get so many compliments back when I used it.

    <li> This is a great product. The more I use it, the better my skin looks. I usually use it at least once a week, and if I&#x27;m breaking out at all, the product usually brings the zit to a head and gets rid of all traces of it within two days. At the same time, the acne scars on my cheeks are fading away with each use. An added bonus is that my normally dry facial skin (especially during winter) instantly disappears whenever I use the product. As soon as my face starts to get that dry feeling, I can use the mask and the face lotion to instantly renew my skin. Also, there&#x27;s a lot of product here considering the seemingly small package. I&#x27;ve used it at least 5 or 6 times, and I still have half of the peel product left and well over half of the neutralizer and lotion. The lotion is especially great because it&#x27;s the only face lotion I&#x27;ve ever bought where a tiny dab of the product can easily be spread across my entire face, so I don&#x27;t have to rub it in forever or use a huge glob that will clog my pores. It feels a little greasy or watery at first, like all lotion, but it is absorbed within a minute or two without leaving a greasy sheen. I&#x27;m sad that this product is no longer available, but I&#x27;m definitely going to look for similar products from L&#x27;Oreal, especially because they seem to like to have a complete package, not just the peel.  Oh, I should mention that, while this product helps my skin from breaking out after each use, glycolic peels are not an everyday-use product. Glycolic (at a safe for home-use level) itself is non-irritating and will not redden or hurt most people&#x27;s skin (even including my overly-sensitive skin), but the peel is helping you to shed pore-clogging dead skin and speed up the turnover of cells, so it&#x27;s not something you even need to use everyday because the cycle of healthy skin growth needs to occur in between uses. So, I still do use a daily acne facial wash in the shower every day, even on days I use the peel, to try to stop break outs; I always perform the peel as soon as I get out of the shower because you want your pores to be open and your skin clean, per the instructions in the box.

In my opinion, I&#x27;d stay away from products with these ingredients, use something gentler like me, and use the peel once or twice a week for best results. Also, don&#x27;t pick or pop pimples, as it leads to scars. That&#x27;s why this peel is so great; it gets rid of your rising zits and speeds up recovery without a scar!</li>
    <li> Used as instructed - 3 times a week. However, after couple of full face treatments, developed a sore rash around eyes, redness and inflamation. Eyes becames sore and dry -stopped using. I didn&#x27;t contacted l&#x27;Oreal. Few days later worse, face hot and burning, rash progressed down face. Eyes became painful.   Some how i&#x27;m gud. It might not fit for some skins. Just beaware when you buying some of these kind of products which may or may not fit for all</li>
    <li> I love the L&#x27;Oreal anti-aging Glycolic Peel Kit (the one pictured) but what I received was the Mini Peel Kit, which I do not care for. The one pictured is not the same as what was sent.</li>
    <li> This product gives a safe peel at home with great results. It has the same strength as the acid used at the derm&#x27;s office. And when you use it properly it makes your skin glow.</li>
    <li> Everyone has been asking me what have i done to my skin!!!! Shhhh its a secret, but happy for you to know</li>
    <li> I love this product,  makes my 45 year old sun damaged skin glow. I wish L&#x27;Oréal would start making it again.</li>
    <li> I did not feel any tingling or change in my face.  I am going back to my doctor to get the real thing.</li>
    <li> I am a 39 female and decided to try this product after reading some of your reviews! I have only used it 4 times which means I have had the product for a little over a week! My aunt came over to visit me and immediately commented on my complexion! I have noticed a considerable decrease in my pore size and overall texture!  I do leave it on a little longer than they suggest...  I think around 8 minutes...  Very simple to use and for the money I am very pleased!  I have never gone to a dermatologist to receive a professional peel, but if I am seeing nice results from this already I am very happy that I am not paying dermatologist prices!  I have fine lines and they seem to be less noticable as well.</li>
    <li> I thought this product was a great way to get started on facial peels before going to a higher percentage of glycolic acid.  It is important for your skin to get used to the product - making sure to follow the directions.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Since I have used it before, I knew I liked it, but the actual product I bought seemed like it had been on a shelf for a few years. It had a weird smell that did not seem &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34;. It still worked, though.</li>
    <li> Sent me a smaller version of the one I ordered .</li>
    <li> This stuff is junk.  It&#x27;s not strong enough to see a difference in pigmentation, exfoliation or fine lines.  I even left the product on overnight and saw no results.  You&#x27;re better off purchasing Glytone&#x27;s starter glycolic acid.  You&#x27;ll at least feel a tingle with that!</li>
    <li> This stuff is junk!&lt;br /&gt;It does not do what is says. Im very disappointed in the product. I love L&#x27;oreal and this just failed for me.&lt;br /&gt;Bottles were tiny. I seen no results using this!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, makes the appearance of large pores smaller and only takes 5 minutes.  Also, my go-to if I&#x27;ve neglected my skin care routine for a couple of days.</li>
    <li> This product is very effective and works against the seborrheic keratosis I&#x27;ve been so fortunate (not) to develop around my hairline now that I am in my sixties. I highly recommend it to refine your delicate facial skin.</li>
    <li> I use to be able to find this product anywhere.  I love it.  My skin looks amazing after using it.  Unfortunately; I cannot&lt;br /&gt;find it anywhere.  If you can find it; I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Feels great on your face but doesn&#x27;t do a darn thing. I didn&#x27;t use exactly as directed but trust me there&#x27;d be no difference if you followed the steps to a T.</li>
