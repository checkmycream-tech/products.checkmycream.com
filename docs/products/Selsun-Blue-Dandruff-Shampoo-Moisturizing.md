      <li>Happy with this all in all.</li>
      <li>I love it!!</li>
      <li>Good question-</li>
      <li>Good on Itchy scalp, helps with the itch and is reasonbly priced.</li>
      <li>Good and works good but.</li>
      <li>this product is good my hair use to fall out</li>
      <li>If isn&#x27;t the price problem the shampoo is good</li>
      <li>just use a really good moisturizing conditioner</li>
      <li>It works the better than the others!</li>
      <li>Please stick with the quality and don&#x27;t downgrade the spec to maximize profit like most companies do!</li>
      <li>and I observed, it feels like kind of sticky.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
      <li>but I actually kind of like it.  </li>
      <li>Also use on face and in ears to effectively eliminate ear wax build up.</li>
      <li>I liked it.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair and this shampoo did a good job of not drying out my hair and the moisturizing effect</li>
      <li>Much better than Head and Shoulders.  </li>
      <li>It works great but does have an unusual smell.  </li>
      <li>id use it like twuce a week at the most.</li>
      <li>then surely the flakes would go away, but</li>
      <li>and i dont have dandruff or flaking any more..</li>
      <li>and this is a problem with more people than myself if you do an internet search.</li>
      <li>Tried buying this online instead of the stores since the price was better.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It smells better to me than</li>
      <li>It is better then everything else out there and trust me I have tryed whats out there.</li>
      <li>Glad I can save time and money.</li>
      <li>Does a great job controlling dandruff and doesn&#x27;t have any ingredients that really scare me, unlike competing shampoos like Head &amp; Shoulders.</li>
      <li>Head and shoulders works better for me.</li>
      <li>need to have a conditioner for sure before you finish your shower.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
      <li>Meaning it is assumed you can use it more than twice a week and not experience unforeseen side effects like your hair falling out.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not bad, but it&#x27;s a very strong scent, akin to that of most men&#x27;s body washes.</li>
      <li>I use it as a body wash because of my problems with dry skin, a problem for which it works great!  </li>
      <li>Leaves hair very clean and soft, eliminates dandruff and itching and discomfort all the scalp, plus it has a pleasant smell reason why they can use it all.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll strongly suggest it to others..</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit too strong a smell afterwards, however it does do the job and cleans your hair.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for years and loved it, so nothing new there.  </li>
      <li>I dont have scalp any more and my hair is super shiny.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, the more economically priced Head and Shoulders does not work for me, so I had to look for an alternative.</li>
      <li>friend lent me their Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shampoo, which worked like a charm and had a fantastic minty smell, but at the cost of upwards of 20 dollars, I just couldn&#x27;t break the bank to buy it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>the original product and the product texture is creamy.  </li>
      <li>Clean hair with no dandruff.</li>
      <li>Does the job needed, I use it on my maltese and it keeps his coat dander free and bright white</li>
      <li>I understand that you don&#x27;t buy this type of product expecting shiny, beautiful smelling hair, but you also don&#x27;t buy it and expect your friends and significant other to wrinkle their noses when you hug, asking why your hair smells like it&#x27;s burning.</li>
      <li>I apprecitate the merchant&#x27;s quick reponse in filling my  order through Amazon.</li>
      <li>Not for me, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be no complaint for the guys.</li>
      <li>Works great - have noticeably less dandruff</li>
      <li>It is packaged well, and good for anyone who doesn&#x27;t live near a store.</li>
      <li>It just works and worth your money.</li>
      <li>It might be good for other things</li>
      <li>I actually threw away a bottle that was probably 70% full, and I&#x27;m just glad I paid with a coupon.</li>
      <li>The package came on time and was exactly what I ordered.</li>
      <li>first for 15 min in a heating shower cap and</li>
      <li>Love the second lathering as it tingles and you can feel it working.</li>
      <li>Thanks a lot, Selsun for the solution!</li>
      <li>What I love more is that this seller has it for about half what I normally pay for it.  </li>
      <li>First off let me say, yes, the product works very well to eliminate flaking and itching.</li>
      <li>I had a bout of dandruff crop up recently after pretty much being dandruff free my whole</li>
      <li>but it really drys out the rest of your hair (you kind of have to figure that because of the harsh ingrdients they use to get rid of the flakes)...</li>
      <li>Works very well on dandruff caused by Eczema.</li>
      <li>Selsun Blue Medicated contains selenium sulfide along with menthol and this product being sold is MOISTURIZING Selsun Blue which does not contain the medicated ingredients - the shipper needs to change their description for sure OR their photo - medicated has a red top.</li>
      <li>I started to use this product about 2 months ago and it has worked very well for me.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t see much difference in my dandruff and my scalp is still itchy.</li>
      <li>(i.e., no one wants to hear/be associated with that).</li>
      <li>I started using it not so much for dandruff, but for sebhorreic dermatitis on my face.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much easier buying online than going to the store.</li>
      <li>haha...</li>
      <li>this Co. They really stink...</li>
      <li>I took a chance however and started using my old Pantene shampoo after rinsing out the Selsun Blue, and I think I&#x27;ve found a winning</li>
      <li>got discouraged because I was uncertain if I could safely mix it with other shampoos to solve these problems.</li>
      <li>Always works better than the other brands.</li>
      <li>It looks like white (on dark skin) or pinkish/tan (on fair skin) blotches.</li>
      <li>Gross, but true-</li>
      <li>but it is a decent product...</li>
      <li>This approach as a plus also makes more room for a second, standard hair-focused shampoo to work through the rest of your hair</li>
      <li>i started to use this and the aloe kept my hair normal</li>
      <li>Having used it for years, it just feels right and definitely controls dandruff.</li>
      <li>This &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; version doesn&#x27;t seem very different from the standard kind, despite my dry scalp.</li>
      <li>I follow up with Caviar conditioner and my hair is very soft.</li>
      <li>I use this after I have taken treatment for tinea versicolor regularly in the summer or when I travel to moist and hot places to keep the tinea at bay.</li>
      <li>more then usual</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t bare to use it for more than 3 days because it not only made my hair dry and brittle</li>
      <li>I bought not long ago and worked really well so far.</li>
      <li>This shampoo works immediately to clear up the flaking on my face.  </li>
      <li>Price was better than locally, but guess my head needs serious repair... didn&#x27;t seem to improve all that much.</li>
      <li>I use it about once or twice a week and works just fine, no more itchy scalp.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Another thing that keeps your hair normal is putting extra virgin olive oil on your scalp.</li>
      <li>I like to always try new things, but back I come to this.</li>
      <li>My second issue was that it doesn&#x27;t do much for your hair- no softening, deep cleansing, etc.</li>
      <li>I have enjoyed Selsun Blue for at least twenty years and it does work as advertised.  </li>
      <li>Hey,I bought this product and now I completely regret it as I have seen the same shampoo in Walmart for 7 dollars including taxes.</li>
      <li>Now you can see my whole head through what little hair I have left, THANKS, SELSUN BLUE, appreciate it!</li>
      <li>In comes Selsun Blue, the second most common commercial dandruff shampoo.</li>
      <li>Does not dry my hair out.</li>
      <li>The smell is really gross, like sulfur (probably the main active ingredient).</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and loved it, so nothing new there.  This is the only shampoo on the market that works for me.  What I love more is that this seller has it for about half what I normally pay for it.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Does the job needed, I use it on my maltese and it keeps his coat dander free and bright white</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed Selsun Blue for at least twenty years and it does work as advertised.  Clean hair with no dandruff.</li>
    <li> I started to use this product about 2 months ago and it has worked very well for me. I dont have scalp any more and my hair is super shiny. I love it!! I have read some comments that it may cause to lose your hair, so I recommend to use it until the scalp goes away and use other one for regular basis!!!</li>
    <li> It works the better than the others!</li>
    <li> I have suffered from a flaky scalp for years and tried just about all otc products with not success. This has been a life saver. Now I can wear black any day.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit too strong a smell afterwards, however it does do the job and cleans your hair.  Nothing bad to say about it in particular given it is right amount of moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I used it by accident, grabbed the wrong shampoo bottle while washing my hair.  All I can say is avoid this stuff.  I do not have a dandruff problem, but after I used this I had terrible scaling and flakes for about 5 days, it was a nightmare. I do not even think my hair was cleaned in the process. Everything cleared up eventually, but if I had a problem with dandruff, I would never use this stuff. from what I can tell your problems will increase 2-fold.</li>
    <li> This was way over priced, and not only that they sent me the wrong shampoo, and there is a &amp;#34;no return policy&amp;#34; with this Co. They really stink...</li>
    <li> Hey,I bought this product and now I completely regret it as I have seen the same shampoo in Walmart for 7 dollars including taxes. I wish I could have known this earlier. If isn&#x27;t the price problem the shampoo is good</li>
    <li> I need this for dandruff, it helped a lot with clearing that up. It is packaged well, and good for anyone who doesn&#x27;t live near a store.</li>
    <li> It works great but does have an unusual smell.  A lot of people complain about it but I actually kind of like it.  I usually use every man jack thickening shampoo and conditioner after I use this so the smell doesn&#x27;t stay anyways.</li>
    <li> this product is good my hair use to fall out more then usual i started to use this and the aloe kept my hair normal again.&lt;br /&gt;Another thing that keeps your hair normal is putting extra virgin olive oil on your scalp. first for 15 min in a heating shower cap and&lt;br /&gt;then wash it off with this . then condition.</li>
    <li> It is better then everything else out there and trust me I have tryed whats out there.It just works and worth your money.Dnt waste it on Phillip B</li>
    <li> I am a devoted Selsun Blue user.  I started using it not so much for dandruff, but for sebhorreic dermatitis on my face.  This shampoo works immediately to clear up the flaking on my face.  It is not a permanent solution, but then nothing is--sebhorreic dermatitis is a lifelong battle.  I prefer to use this moisturizing shampoo rather than harsh chemicals or expensive medications.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo to help heal my dry, irritated and flaky scalp, and I have to say this stuff is seriously foul. I understand that you don&#x27;t buy this type of product expecting shiny, beautiful smelling hair, but you also don&#x27;t buy it and expect your friends and significant other to wrinkle their noses when you hug, asking why your hair smells like it&#x27;s burning. Beware- the smell of this shampoo seeps into your scalp and roots and won&#x27;t come out. I&#x27;ve stopped using it for a week and can&#x27;t get the odor out. The chemicals in this shampoo ruined the porcelain plaiting of my hair straightener- I had to buy a new one to get rid of that horrible stench. Does it work on dry scalp and dandruff? Good question- I couldn&#x27;t bare to use it for more than 3 days because it not only made my hair dry and brittle, I couldn&#x27;t cope with the odor. I didn&#x27;t see much difference in my dandruff and my scalp is still itchy.</li>
    <li> If your scalp itchy and flaky, use this and it will be all cured. It works for me and my wife.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly! Get some!</li>
    <li> I discovered dandruff on my hair after I made my last and  final visit to my regular barber shop. While searching for a cure, I read reviews online about this product. This product is not as described for dandruff. It might be good for other things but I will not recommend this for dandruff.</li>
    <li> The smell is really gross, like sulfur (probably the main active ingredient). I used it once and couldn&#x27;t bear the smell of it all day. Will not use again.</li>
    <li> Price was better than locally, but guess my head needs serious repair... didn&#x27;t seem to improve all that much.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this product to help with my dandruff, because other products had not worked for me. Since my hair is really dark and my wardrobe has a lot of dark colors, the dandruff has always been really embarrassing for me. Despite buying the moisturizing version of Selsun Blue, my hair immediately feels so dried out when using this shampoo and it smells awful. I would even be willing to ignore that if the dandruff decreased, but it actually got worse! Every single time I have used this, my dandruff is worse than before. I thought maybe if I used it several times in a row (over a couple weeks) then surely the flakes would go away, but no. Luckily I found a shampoo/conditioner with tea tree oil that helps so much, but Selsun Blue just made the dandruff worse than it has ever been and made my hair so dried out and feeling damaged. I actually threw away a bottle that was probably 70% full, and I&#x27;m just glad I paid with a coupon.</li>
    <li> hi guys,&lt;br /&gt;This is not a paid review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I brought this product in Walmart for 6.98$ only.&lt;br /&gt;And I used this product the day brought it and I observed, it feels like kind of sticky.&lt;br /&gt;You need to have a conditioner for sure before you finish your shower.&lt;br /&gt;Will update soon with results.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m planning to have a long hair, but I have these pimples on my scalp, as others suggested I brought this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I helps fight dandruff but I wouldnt use it before like adte or something id use it like twuce a week at the most.</li>
    <li> Good and works good but.</li>
    <li> The shampoo was packaged well and, unlike other liquids I have purchased online, arrived undamaged. I think I have been using Selsun Blue for a quarter century. I continue to be flake-free.</li>
    <li> Arrived without having opened, was shipped properly to prevent it from spilling over into other products.  I use it as a body wash because of my problems with dry skin, a problem for which it works great!  Not too &amp;#34;chemically&amp;#34; scented (sorry for the bad grammar...I&#x27;m tired) so that you don&#x27;t have to worry about smelling like a chemical factory after showering.  Just wanted to add a review of this product.</li>
    <li> I bought not long ago and worked really well so far. No dandruff and don&#x27;t feel itchy. I stick with the guidance of no more than 2 times per week though, the rest of time just use organic shampoo instead. Thanks a lot, Selsun for the solution! Please stick with the quality and don&#x27;t downgrade the spec to maximize profit like most companies do!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, such a bad product, I tried one way and I got headache, and it has such a bad smell.</li>
    <li> This stuff does work to get rid of dandruff/dry skin whatever you have...but it really drys out the rest of your hair (you kind of have to figure that because of the harsh ingrdients they use to get rid of the flakes)...but it is a decent product...just use a really good moisturizing conditioner haha...</li>
    <li> I recommend it to everyone. Leaves hair very clean and soft, eliminates dandruff and itching and discomfort all the scalp, plus it has a pleasant smell reason why they can use it all.</li>
    <li> Tried buying this online instead of the stores since the price was better. Happy with this all in all. It&#x27;s much easier buying online than going to the store. Glad I can save time and money.</li>
    <li> Does a great job controlling dandruff and doesn&#x27;t have any ingredients that really scare me, unlike competing shampoos like Head &amp; Shoulders. This &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; version doesn&#x27;t seem very different from the standard kind, despite my dry scalp. I imagine your mileage may vary.</li>
    <li> I regularly used the Selsun Blue [Medicated] at the reccommendation of my doctor to prevent and reduce dermal rosacea. Wanted to try the Aloe  recipe for continued healing of itching around nape of neck. Also use on face and in ears to effectively eliminate ear wax build up. Wait  about 2  minutes  to rinse  for lather to  cover pores,  but keep on scrubing  scalp as feeling  for  itch factor and reduction  of sensory irriation.  I apprecitate the merchant&#x27;s quick reponse in filling my  order through Amazon.</li>
    <li> I find this to be a great shampoo. Having used it for years, it just feels right and definitely controls dandruff.</li>
    <li> Recommended to use on my dog with scratching &amp; itching problems.  It works great, but leaves a little unpleasant odor.</li>
    <li> . I remember using this once in college&lt;br /&gt;and I didn&#x27;t need it for years after that;&lt;br /&gt;(dandruff is fungal infection, I heard).&lt;br /&gt;. 20 years later I need it for both scalp and feet .</li>
    <li> Live in a cold environment and my scalp will get dry in the winter.  I use it about once or twice a week and works just fine, no more itchy scalp.  Problem solved.</li>
    <li> First off let me say, yes, the product works very well to eliminate flaking and itching. One unfortunate side effect, however, is it caused my hair to start thinning within 4 months of use. Apparently, I&#x27;m not alone and this is a problem with more people than myself if you do an internet search. The bottle recommends you use at LEAST twice a week. Not ONLY twice a week....at LEAST. Meaning it is assumed you can use it more than twice a week and not experience unforeseen side effects like your hair falling out. Maybe I would have had different results if I used it less. My complaint is, if there is a chance for side effects there should be a MINIMUM/MAXIMUM USE LABEL, unlike the vague one they chose to go with to not scare off potential buyers. After a few months of not using it my hair still hasn&#x27;t grown back. Before using this I had very thick hair and you couldn&#x27;t see my scalp unless you separated my hair. Now you can see my whole head through what little hair I have left, THANKS, SELSUN BLUE, appreciate it!</li>
    <li> Selsun Blue Medicated contains selenium sulfide along with menthol and this product being sold is MOISTURIZING Selsun Blue which does not contain the medicated ingredients - the shipper needs to change their description for sure OR their photo - medicated has a red top.</li>
    <li> Works very well on dandruff caused by Eczema.</li>
    <li> Does not dry my hair out. Love the second lathering as it tingles and you can feel it working. Does not have a bad smell. I follow up with Caviar conditioner and my hair is very soft. Will repurchase.</li>
    <li> excellent item...works great on my hair. No problem. Thanks</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say it worked for me. Head and shoulders works better for me. The package came on time and was exactly what I ordered.</li>
    <li> Dermatologists recommend this in conjunction with prescription oral/topical treatment for tibea versicolor, a yeast on the skin similar to vitiligo that manifests itself on the chest, back, or upper arms in humid climates. It looks like white (on dark skin) or pinkish/tan (on fair skin) blotches. I use this after I have taken treatment for tinea versicolor regularly in the summer or when I travel to moist and hot places to keep the tinea at bay.</li>
    <li> Good on Itchy scalp, helps with the itch and is reasonbly priced. I would not hesitate to recommend it for itchy scalp.</li>
    <li> I works like  a charm...</li>
    <li> very good shampoo.. applied for 3 weeks continuously (twice a week) and i dont have dandruff or flaking any more.. itching has stopped as well!!!! I&#x27;ll strongly suggest it to others..</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and this shampoo did a good job of not drying out my hair and the moisturizing effect did not weigh my hair down.&lt;br /&gt;It smells better to me than the original product and the product texture is creamy.  I liked it.</li>
    <li> I had a bout of dandruff crop up recently after pretty much being dandruff free my whole life.&lt;br /&gt;My friend lent me their Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shampoo, which worked like a charm and had a fantastic minty smell, but at the cost of upwards of 20 dollars, I just couldn&#x27;t break the bank to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the more economically priced Head and Shoulders does not work for me, so I had to look for an alternative. In comes Selsun Blue, the second most common commercial dandruff shampoo. It works decently enough for me, but I&#x27;m no fan of the smell- it&#x27;s not bad, but it&#x27;s a very strong scent, akin to that of most men&#x27;s body washes. Not for me, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be no complaint for the guys. My second issue was that it doesn&#x27;t do much for your hair- no softening, deep cleansing, etc. effect which make a big difference for long hair.&lt;br /&gt;I got discouraged because I was uncertain if I could safely mix it with other shampoos to solve these problems. I took a chance however and started using my old Pantene shampoo after rinsing out the Selsun Blue, and I think I&#x27;ve found a winning combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usage tip: The harsh reality of dandruff is that it&#x27;s caused by fungus. Gross, but true- H&amp;S and Selsun don&#x27;t say it outright because it&#x27;s a bad marketing approach (i.e., no one wants to hear/be associated with that). It causes the excess flaking, redness, and itchiness- your body is reacting to the fungus. So when using Selsun Blue, focus on working it all around your scalp as opposed to just lathering it in your hair. It&#x27;s your scalp skin that needs the antifungal active ingredient, selenium disulfide. This approach as a plus also makes more room for a second, standard hair-focused shampoo to work through the rest of your hair (i.e., less mixing/potential negating of the effects of the other- if and when there is effect any at all).&lt;br /&gt;And because it contains selenium disulfide, you could potentially use it to treat Tinea versicolor rashes on other areas of your skin.</li>
    <li> Works great - have noticeably less dandruff</li>
    <li> Much better than Head and Shoulders.  Once or twice a year I need a scalp treatment for flaking skin.  Will stick to this one from now on.</li>
    <li> I have always suffered from dry scalp and its always been bad in the winter.  This is the only product that has worked for me.</li>
    <li> Always works better than the other brands. I like to always try new things, but back I come to this. Probably will still be using it 30 yrs from now.</li>
