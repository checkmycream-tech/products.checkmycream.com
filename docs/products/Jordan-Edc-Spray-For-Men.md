      <li>Very pleased with this cologne, it stay with him, smells great and recommend.  </li>
      <li>Good smelling after it drys but</li>
      <li>You will surely get some compliments!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s amazing thank you...</li>
      <li>Jordan is a decent fragrance that smells good, but it has performance challenges - not a &amp;#34;Jordanesque&amp;#34; type of performer..!!</li>
      <li>,  I can say that this is my favorite,  is really refreshing, and  people tell me that I smell good.</li>
      <li>I personally love this smell and the ladies will love it!.</li>
      <li>Out of the bottle, Jordan is a likable, but synthetic, blend of floral, musk, and woodsy notes.</li>
      <li>It smells more like cleaning solution.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely better than Michael Jordan by Michael Jordan.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Jordan cologne for 10 years or more.</li>
      <li>it smelled just fine.</li>
      <li>This item shipped to me so quickly!</li>
      <li>The \\&quot;cologne\\&quot; could have been filled with just water, and I would not get a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Enjoy your day...</li>
      <li>I like the bottle and the price is fantastic.</li>
      <li>Very fresh smell for twenty bucks.</li>
      <li>Product came quick and was easily traceable.</li>
      <li>to receive and open it seems of good quality wine in a box well protected.</li>
      <li>If you want a slightly more masculine version of Curve, this will work just fine.</li>
      <li>The performance is modest at best, lasting 2 to 4 hours on me (and clothing) at skin level after the first hour.</li>
      <li>I will add that it is clean and fresh.</li>
      <li>And if you a want more contemporary version of Tim Mc Graw&#x27;s Men&#x27;s Cologne, this will also do the job.</li>
      <li>My son loves this cologne, it has a fresh smell and when he wears you can smell it through out the house</li>
      <li>so I never really got to use it, but other than that greatest cologne to me ever.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a sweet, not so masculine smell but it will still catch attention of the ladies!</li>
      <li>Often received positive comments.</li>
      <li>It came exactly as described and was packaged very well.</li>
      <li>My 23 year old son loves this was delivered quickly also</li>
      <li>I like it so much Jordans things</li>
      <li>Arrived fast.</li>
      <li>I really like this cologne</li>
      <li>Stays strong all day long.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised at the scent.</li>

<li> Cologne does not smell like the usual Jordan cologne I have purchased the last few years.</li>
<li> It is a rip-off that we cannot return these kinds of items.</li>
<li> Silly!</li>

    <li> Thank you, will order again.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised at the scent. It has that just out of the shower smell. It&#x27;s not overpowering and lasts all day. It&#x27;s definitely better than Michael Jordan by Michael Jordan.  If you want a slightly more masculine version of Curve, this will work just fine. And if you a want more contemporary version of Tim Mc Graw&#x27;s Men&#x27;s Cologne, this will also do the job. At $15.00, it is among the best in its price range along with Diable Bleu.</li>
    <li> I did not really like this perfume. A friend of mine recommended it for me, but it is not my type. Otherwise, everything was great!</li>
    <li> This is Very impressive product with a very good price, seldom to see some thing like this. I am recommended. The Seller was wonderful.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s amazing thank you...</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this cologne, it stay with him, smells great and recommend.  Don&#x27;t have anymore words so I will fill in with these!  Silly!</li>
    <li> Great smelling cologne! it&#x27;s a sweet, not so masculine smell but it will still catch attention of the ladies! m</li>
    <li> This item shipped to me so quickly! It came exactly as described and was packaged very well. I am very impressed and will buy from this seller again. I wish all sellers were as cognizant of buyers needs.</li>
    <li> I really like this cologne,  I can say that this is my favorite,  is really refreshing, and  people tell me that I smell good.</li>
    <li> Loved it! Product came quick and was easily traceable. Smells like the way I remembered it. Stays strong all day long.</li>
    <li> Cologne does not smell like the usual Jordan cologne I have purchased the last few years. It smells more like cleaning solution. It is a rip-off that we cannot return these kinds of items. The \\&quot;cologne\\&quot; could have been filled with just water, and I would not get a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is strange is I have bought this product before in the past and it smelled just fine. I&#x27;m guessing their supplier must have changed.</li>
    <li> Good smelling after it drys but kinda smells like chemicals when it&#x27;s wet</li>
    <li> I like it so much Jordans things</li>
    <li> My 23 year old son loves this was delivered quickly also</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Jordan cologne for 10 years or more. Often received positive comments. This bottle looks like my other ones, but the smell is weak, and I can&#x27;t really identify it as Jordan.  I&#x27;m going to pick up a bottle at a regular store, and then compare.  Maybe it&#x27;s me.</li>
    <li> to receive and open it seems of good quality wine in a box well protected. The number of stars not complete because I have not completely exceeds my expectations</li>
    <li> My son loves this cologne, it has a fresh smell and when he wears you can smell it through out the house</li>
    <li> Like I said this is the only cologne I wear period, but I had to give it a low 2stars because I order two bottles and one bottle had a leak in it so I never really got to use it, but other than that greatest cologne to me ever.</li>
    <li> Son loves it. Grear pricing. Arrived fast.</li>
    <li> Very fresh smell for twenty bucks. I personally love this smell and the ladies will love it!. You will surely get some compliments!</li>
    <li> Jordan is a decent fragrance that smells good, but it has performance challenges - not a &amp;#34;Jordanesque&amp;#34; type of performer..!! Out of the bottle, Jordan is a likable, but synthetic, blend of floral, musk, and woodsy notes. I will add that it is clean and fresh. The performance is modest at best, lasting 2 to 4 hours on me (and clothing) at skin level after the first hour. I like the bottle and the price is fantastic. All said, I would only recommend Jordan for the novice or amateur &amp;#34;frag head&amp;#34;.  3.5 Stars out of 5 Stars... Enjoy your day...</li>
