    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a month along with some other products and my face has cleared up so much. It got here in about 4 days which I didn&#x27;t think was bad and everything was just as it was describbed. I would recommend this for anyone looking to try, that&#x27;s looking for a new skin care product.</li>
    <li> Very nice emulsion. I love the texture. A little definitely goes a long way. It has a fragrance as do all the Face Shop products. I recommend but you do need a regular night cream for over it in the colder months. I follow the Korean cleansing method so that is a normal part of my routine anyways.</li>
    <li> My teenaged daughter loves the whole range of the rice and ceramide. Her face has cleared up and she says it absorbs so well.</li>
    <li> I got into this whole Korean skin care ordeal. This is great!</li>
    <li> I have used three different rice waters. All have been good but this one in particular is the lighter and I prefer it to the others</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of products and this one is the right fit for my skin type. I am beyond pleased.</li>
    <li> This is a good moisturizer but some people might be turned off by the scent. The perfume ingredient is a little too strong. I&#x27;ve been using non-scented moisturizers so I probably got used to not smelling anything.</li>
    <li> This emulsion is super hydrating. I use it every night and my skin feels like baby&#x27;s butt in the morning. No more tight feelings.&lt;br /&gt;It does have a relatively strong scent. But it does not give me any discomfort.</li>
    <li> Light perfect moisture for the summer months!</li>
    <li> The item didn&#x27;t meet my expectations. Unfortunately I can&#x27;t even rate performance of this face cream as the scent is too powerful to apply it on (please note that I don&#x27;t have sensitivities and never before had any issues with strong scent in my cosmetics). It sits on my shelf and I have no idea what to do with it other than donate it  to goodwill.</li>
    <li> My friend suggested it to me. I ordered and it arrived 2 weeks before the delivery date. It&#x27;s very nice. Thin texture and gives your skin a fresh shine. I love it. Will be ordering the face wash soon. Thank you Lucky cat.</li>
    <li> Feels smooth after using it. Recommend to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want oil lotion. Great for summer.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery and have been using this product for a week now and I like it so far. The only thing about this product is the smell can be a little overpowering but other than that, my skin likes it!</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer. Love it.</li>
    <li> I use this moisturizer right before and after I use a mask ( like the avocado one I purchased below.&lt;br /&gt;This would make a wonderful moisturizer for a teenager who breaks out often.</li>
    <li> Love it&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 years</li>
