<li> , it&#x27;s like you never took it, so technically speaking, it only works as long as take it, there is no spectrum of the ingredients in your body, just like every 4life product.</li>
<li> I bought it as a gift for my sister, she says she feels way better and that she hasn&#x27;t even caught a cold since she started taking these pills  over a year ago.</li>
