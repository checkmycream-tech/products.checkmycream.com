<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> These brushes are amazing for the price, they don&#x27;t shed and they give you such a nice flawless finish when applying foundation, i love them!</li>
    <li> Theses brushes are awesome!!!!!!! I&#x27;ve used them multiple times and washed them and I have noticed minimal to no shedding i mean litterally like one strand. They male your foundation application Flawless!!!!! And can be used wet or dry.</li>
    <li> These brushes are EVERYTHING! Seriously...they are extremely soft...very durable...and applies product very well!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not gonna lie I seriously thought they were gonna be some cheap makeup brushes. But I loved them. I received them yesterday morning..and yeah the smell everyone was talking about was kinda funky. But it was no biggie to me. I washed them right away and I was immediately impressed because not once did any of the brushes shed. I used them this morning and I can&#x27;t wait to use the again tonight! They&#x27;re definitely a must have!!!</li>
    <li> These brushes are super great for the price. I really like the flat top foundation brush. It really blends my make up beautifully without streaks. I tend to push or tab the foundation into my skin as opposed to gliding it over my face. I feel like tapping or pushing the product with this brush creates less streaks and visible lines than gliding would. They are pretty good quality and I would definitely buy them again.</li>
    <li> I gave these brushes a 4 star rating compared to certain pricier brushes you pay for they&#x27;re not as great, BUT..... they could ALMOST be. Surprisingly they were of good quality for the cost of them. The brushes pick up a lot of product and holds well on the bristles. The bristles are thick and really soft against your skin (having really sensitive skin). They don&#x27;t shed much. Just make sure you wash them well.</li>
    <li> I got these faster than expected! They do have that weird smell everyone talks about. But it goes away after cleaning them. I am very satisfied with my purchase! The brushes are very soft and dense and great quality!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I could have made a better decision with buying these brushes. I have nothing but good things to say about them. They don&#x27;t shed, they don&#x27;t smell like chemicals, they&#x27;re dense, the bristles are soft, they are seriously INCREDIBLE. My foundation has never looked better, I ask myself how I lived without these before.&lt;br /&gt;The price is unbeatable. I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing an eye brush set and a backup of the kabuki brush set as well. Royal Care Cosmetics, you&#x27;re outdone yourself! Bravo!</li>
    <li> I love the flat top!!!! I own the sigma F80 and people said the F80 is more dense but they are exactly the same. I love it!! I haven&#x27;t used the pointed and domed one so I can&#x27;t say anything but the flat top and slanted one are AMAZING!!!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. I ordered them on a Friday and received them on Monday. I live in Florida. But anyways I&#x27;ve used them every single day since getting them. They&#x27;re really soft, picks up the right amount of product, and apply the product exactly where you want it. The best brushes are the pointed contour brush and the blush brush. Uuh im in looooooooovveeeee.</li>
    <li> The BEST comparable brush so far to Sigma&#x27;s F80 Flattop kabuki. I would say this one is slightly softer with more give in the bristles, not quite as firm. But that could be better depending on your preference and for the same price as 1 F80 from Sigma you get 4 total brushes for face applications.</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing! I was using a similar synthetic flat top kabuki brush (not going to put the brand on here) that cost about $15 and I definitely prefer the flat top one from this set now. I expected them to be okay, but not that great since they are cheaper than a lot of the other similar brushes. But these are just as good, if not better. I use them mostly for my liquid foundation and they give me such a flawless look, they don&#x27;t leave any brush streaks, and there is little to no fallout. I love love love these brushes! They are so soft yet dense, and they don&#x27;t suck up all your product. Five stars for sure!</li>
    <li> These brushes are gold! Physically and metaphorically! I highly recommend these brushes if your looking to buy the Sigma Kabuki brush set, but don&#x27;t want to turn out your pockets. These brushes are dense and soft as silk. They may not be as dense as the Sigmas, but the application is just as phenomenal!</li>
    <li> Great brush set for the price!!. nice amd fluffy easy to use and clean very durable will diffently purchase more from royal care cosmetics.</li>
    <li> I use these brushes every single day... EVERY SINGLE DAY.  In my life of brushes, I have had tried almost all of them.  Crown, Sigma, Dior, MAC, Real Techniques, Japonesque... my list goes on and on. But these four brushes are probably my most superior brushes of them all. SERIOUSLY. This is how they work in my daily life:&lt;br /&gt;Flat top: I use this for ALL my foundations, liquid and mineral and cream. it does amazing even coverage, and has the ability to layer if you need to without making your foundation cakey. Even my crappiest foundation looks great. This works so much better than a standard foundation brush, or stippling brush.  Even my beloved beauty blender has been set aside, because of how easy this brush is to use.  Of all the brushes in this set- this one is my new &amp;#34;can&#x27;t live without.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Pointed top: I use this for my under eye concealer. The pointed top gets into the crevices and blends them out seamlessly without leaving it cakey.  I also use it for the crevices in my nose.  It also works AMAZING for when you are doing a dramatic contour, and you want to cut an amazing defined line.&lt;br /&gt;Slant top: I use this for contouring it gets into the hallows of my cheeks and sides of my face with exact precision and size. (I bought the mini brush version of this set and use the mini slant to contour my nose)&lt;br /&gt;Round top: I use this to buff out and blend all hard lines to my face regime.  It makes my blush, contour, bronzer, highlight, and face powder look PERFECT.&lt;br /&gt;And other details: no shedding, keeps shape, cleans evenly, gorgeous gold ferrule. This brush set looks and feels and works like a top of the line set of brushes.  I am buying a backup, and sets for all my makeup friends for the holidays.</li>
    <li> They work awesome! Smooth flawless foundation coverage with these brushes so worth the price. They are soft to the touch but firm enough to buff the make up into the skin.</li>
    <li> these brushes are really good super soft and does such a great job im definetly thinking of getting another set and the price is right!!</li>
    <li> I placed my order jan 26 and received my brushes jan 30! I had received in bubble wrap which was ok. It did have a strong smell but after I shampooed them, the smell went away. They are all super sturdy and I had NO shedding during/after washing them. Major plus. The flat top brush and the blush brush I believe is more soft than the concealer/pointed top brush. I can&#x27;t wait to try a look when they fully dry. Follow my IG for the makeup look JerliciaDotCom</li>
    <li> I especially love the flat top kabuki brush in this set. It blends my foundation perfectly. And the brush with the pointed end gets my setting powder perfectly under my eyes!</li>
    <li> I got these brushes last week and I used them everyday this week to apply my foundation and concealer and I have loved them!  They made my products go on perfectly and they did not shed at all.  I read a few reviews that said that there was an odor to the brushes.  I noticed a slight order when I first opened them, but after I used them just one time, I could not smell it anymore at all.  I own the Sigma brush set which is highly recommended in the beauty community (a five times more expensive) and I think these work just as well!  I&#x27;m recommending them to all my friends!</li>
    <li> Great quality.  I use them much more than my Sigma or MAC brushes. Very durable. I&#x27;m going to purchase another set asap. No shedding! Great price! Don&#x27;t hesitate order your set today</li>
    <li> I was a little unsure when I saw a negative review about the brushes, but decided to give it a try regardless. The brushes arrived in less than a week and were extremely soft! There was absolute no shedding of these brushes, gripped powder nicely, they worked great for me! Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> The the glue on ferrule on the flat top kabuki loosened up! I can completely pull it apart from the handle :-(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are amazing brushes and I&#x27;ll definitely just glue the pieces back together but it&#x27;s a little disappointing..</li>
    <li> Bristles are supersoft, and they look like really high end products. No shedding, soft. I ordered these with real techniques and I do say i prefer these to those and my sigma brushes. I ve been using mac kabuki brushes for a while, being human hair, they shed like crazy. But rhese, these are perfect. i&#x27;ll have happier clients with this for sure</li>
    <li> These brushes are sooooo nice!! Well worth itt!!!!!!! Nicely made, look very professional:)) I have bought brushes that were wayyyyy more expensive at Sephora, and these are just as good or even better!!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. They&#x27;re so soft and make my makeup look great, sometimes people don&#x27;t know that a bad or old brush can make your makeup look caked on or uneven and end up thinking it&#x27;s the makeup when it&#x27;s actual the brush. My makeup always looks great using them and you don&#x27;t have to use as much versus using a sponge.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE these brushes. They glide on smooth, easy to clean, and great quality. I love the length of the brushes.</li>
    <li> I have been a MUA (makeup artist) for twenty years. I hate spending money on expensive brushes. So when I got these brushes, I had no high hopes. I love them!!!! I can not be more happy!  For the price they are amazing!</li>
    <li> So soft &amp; easy to clean. I love my brushes! I am happy with my purchase! Recommend to all! Go for it!</li>
    <li> For the price, these brushes are awesome!!  Totally worth it! I would recommend this to anyone ! They do smell a little funny upon arrival however after the first wash they have no scent.</li>
    <li> I adore these brushes! They are great quality (no shedding, full, sturdy, soft, hold shape), I really recommend these brushes to any mua or someone who enjoys contouring their face. I will be buying a set for personal use and professional use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only cons are a slight smell (goes away with 1 washing) and that there is no case or even a small travel pouch to keep them in. But then again is that RC&#x27;s responsibility?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two thumbs up!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush set three months ago, and am very satisfied with the purchase. Sometimes you compromise quality when you buy something affordable, but that is NOT the case with these brushes. I wash them very frequently (the flat-top brush is washed daily since I use it to apply foundation) and find that they are very durable; they hold their shape nicely and do not shed at all. They apply the makeup very smoothly and do not absorb much of the liquid makeup.  Some reviewers complained about a strong odor, but I did not have that experience. Regardless, it&#x27;s a good idea to wash the brushes prior to using them for the first time. I highly recommend these brushes. You get quality products for a very reasonable price!</li>
    <li> Really great brushes! These are the softest brushes I own. Really worth the price. I did notice minor shedding after washing the brushes the 3rd time, especially the flat top brush.</li>
    <li> Looks and feels professional- after a few months they started falling out- so I just trim and it seems to work. Don&#x27;t forget to clean w olive oil and dish detergent.</li>
    <li> I love love these brushes I have owned them now for months and I have washed and used and abused these brushes and they are magnificent!!</li>
    <li> I received them earlier than expected, HUGE plus! I tried them out yesterday,  and immediately fell in love with them. They feel so silky on the skin. Beet buy so far! I plan on purchasing another set, this time for my sis for hr birthday. ;)</li>
    <li> Girls, believe me, you can&#x27;t find a better value or quality set of brushes on the market. I bought the gold face set, and the 4 piece detail/ eye set of these brushes. They are super soft, blend beautifully, and each one is multi use in its functionality. The round kabuki is great for foundations- and I prefer it to my beauty blender. The pointed one works perfectly under the eyes and bc it is so large, it applies concealer quicker than small brushes. The flat top is great for powdering and then the angled one is perfect for contouring or blush. If I had to give a thumbs down on any aspect of these, it would be that the handles on the eye brushes are long and make close up work in a mirror difficult. But overall, they are my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; beauty tools on a daily basis. love, love, love......</li>
    <li> these are awesome little brushes for the money.  they work great, don&#x27;t shed, are very soft and I recommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> Extremly good i loved that i didnt have to spend so much money to get good brushes</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Exactly like the buyer descriped. It is a replica of the Sigma kabuki brushes in my opinion</li>
    <li> When I read the reviews on these brushes, I decided to give them a try. I saw comparisons to sigma brushes, which I own so I put it to the test. When I got the bushes out of the packaging, the smell was pretty strong. It went away though after the first wash thought. I used the buffing brush for my foundation and was very pleased. It went on super quickly and evenly. So far, I&#x27;m glad I bought these brush, and the price is amazing compared to sigma.</li>
    <li> Ok let me tell you all, I use this brushes every single day. They are so packed that it makes makeup application so easy. No brush strikes no sir.They are easy to clean and they still stay as soft as new.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes very comparable to sigma except one came apart but the brush quality is very nice.</li>
    <li> I prefer my natural hair brushes.  They work bette than these synthetic ones and are more supple and not so hard and not as blendable as natural hair brushes for makeup.  I believe that these brushes would be ideal for painting using acrylic paints for they are tough and stiff for use with acrylics but wouldn&#x27;t be recommended for oil painting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a lot of hype that synthetic brushes are better for they are antibacterial and this ballyhoo advertising for selling a less expensive product with good packaging is just hype.  The price was good compared to other synthetic makeup brushes and I suppose if someone had never know the blending ability of natural hair brushes, it would work for them just fine.  Yet we all know that one you have been using the best all along, something of less usefulness and blendability will never satisfy you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will stick with the brushes used by professional makeup artists in the future.  However, the brushes I do have for makeup I have had for over 20 years and as far as antibacterial being advertisin for synthetics, well you can wash your natural hair brushes in soap and dip them or spray them with an antibacterial spray like Beauty So Simple or one of their other products.  There are other products on the market where you can wash your brushes with a liquid antibacterial soap in water first, but I use an antibaterial dish washing soap and spray it before each use with Beauty So Simple spray.</li>
    <li> The brushes are pretty great! Soft easy to wash, they just take a while to dry but they are really great! So far I&#x27;ve used the flat kabuki brush the one that is similar to Sigma F80 brush, and when putting on my liquid foundation make up its smooth and easy to use making my face look flawless:):)!!&lt;br /&gt;I also loved how they arrived the next day after I ordered them; fastest shipping ever!</li>
    <li> I order these brushes on the25th of February. They arrived earlier. Before I use ANY NEW BRUSHES I WASH them. I have used only 2out of 4. The bristles are very soft and gentle on my face. I had gotten ahold to some harsh brushes and these are the BEST. I recommend these brushes.</li>
    <li> Used lots of brushes. I&#x27;d rather spend more and have better brushes. I guess these are decent for the price. They&#x27;re just too darn stiff for my liking. The only one I will occasionally use is the flat top brush to apply foundation. But even still I have other brushes I prefer</li>
    <li> I have many brushes.  Some on the high end of price, which have lasted me 25 years (seriously).  I&#x27;ve taken good care of them and they are such a good quality that they have lasted.  Was skeptical on these due to the inexpensive price, but was pleasantly surprised when first used them.  Nice soft feel, no shedding, and does an excellent job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like them so much, I bought a friend a set.  She is new to using brushes to apply makeup, and this set will do well to help her get started.  Would recommend</li>
    <li> These brushes do the trick for what is needed, but I am a little saddened that some of the brush is falling apart already... Only one brush seems to be loosing the &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34;....Other than that, they are great!</li>
    <li> I would compare them to mac brushes. They are good brushes for the price. I mainly use the powder brush</li>
    <li> i ordered these as a Christmas gift i loved them, there&#x27;s never a disappointment with royal care. i have to order a second pair for myself.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes especially for the price lol even my bf noticed a change on how my makeup looked so that&#x27;s always a plus</li>
    <li> These are soft which is nice for the skin. HOwever, they cam completely unmarked as to which brush is for what purpose. Luckily, a nice lady wrote a review explaining what each brush is for. Could the sender include some instruction as to how to use each brush? It would help. Haven&#x27;t tried cleaning these yet. That will be the real test of destruction.</li>
    <li> It was time for me to retire my old brushes. These work so well! Spreads my make-up evenly with no streaks.</li>
    <li> These are amazing! I&#x27;ve had them for about a month now and use them everyday! So glad I bought these instead of going to bigger brands.</li>
    <li> I am In love with these brushes. I use one of them every day to apply my foundation and i love it. It applies evenly, does not shed and is super soft. Prices is extremely affordable and quality is excelent. Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> ITS AS GOOD AS THE SIGMA LINE OF BRUSHES.  I WAS VERY PLEASED WITH HOW THEY WORKED WITH FOUNDATION AND BLUSHES.</li>
    <li> These are great got a set for all of my family girl&#x27;s that wear their makeup daily....  :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-)!</li>
    <li> At first I was really skeptical about the quality of these brushes. I had just received my set of sigma brushes and had been loving them and while I was browsing through Instagram, I follow a lot of makeup artists pages, I came across royal care cosmetics Instagram page and I was super interested in trying out this four peice kabuki set. I placed my order and i got them in a really short amount of time. Tracking was nice and super convenient. When I got them they were really nicely packaged. They came individually wrapped in their plastic package and they were all enclosed in bubble wrap to ensure that no damage came to them. Right off the bat they were super super soft, there was a slight &amp;#34;new product&amp;#34; smell to them but I always wash my brushes before use and once I did the smell completely went away. I love the flat top kabuki for applying my foundation, and it works well with any type from very liquid foundation like my urban decay naked skin foundation to my MAC match master foundation which has a thicker consistency. The round top kabuki brush is great for blending under eye concealer and the dome kabuki is great for highlighting. The brushes are super dense and are so versatile. I honestly recommend these brushes to anyone, from professional MUA&#x27;s to beginners. These brushes make makeup application so easy and the results are flawless! I will definitely re-purchase from royal care :)</li>
    <li> title says it all really. i have used all 4 of these and they are all amazing. great for liquid foundation, concealer, powder, bronzer, highlight. anything and everything. i love these. they are soo soft, so dense, great at blending, sturdy, and just gorgeous. so so happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I just recently received my brushes, 3 days after purchasing them. Not only was I very pleased with the rushed delivery but these brushes are AMAZING. I was using MAC foundation and powder with a regular sponge because I did not have my make up brushes and was unhappy with the finish (making me look caked on with makeup). But once I used the brushes with my MAC it literally made my face look airbrushed. I absolutely plan on buying any future make up brushes from RC Cosmetics and would recommend to anyone looking to buy some great quality brushes for cheap. I own Sephora (26+ dollar brushes) and cannot tell the difference in quality. Buy and you will NOT be disappointed. PS. The \\&quot;smell\\&quot; of the brushes is no big deal. Wash and it&#x27;ll be fine</li>
    <li> Excellent brushes well worth the money. Had them over a month no shedding soft and durable great for make up artist</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to buy these all over again!!!! Just cause I&#x27;m board!!! These are must haves!!! And I&#x27;m a professional makeup artist!</li>
    <li> Due to the amazing reviews these brushes got, I ordered them. For the price they are good quality brushes, but they can´t compare to the quality of Sigma brushes and other Kabuki brushes I own. My complain is that they could be more soft and flexible on the skin, but nevertheless you can´t go wrong with this set. For the price they are a great buy!</li>
    <li> I was looking for face brushes and these were perfect! they work great and are super soft. I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Very nice brushes that don&#x27;t shed. I bought these because of the other reviews and am not disappointed. These brushes have some firmness and are very soft at the same time.</li>
    <li> These are really good brushes for the price. They are firm but yet soft and are great for applying liquid foundation. I love them definitely would purchase again.  they also shipped fast</li>
    <li> I&#x60;m in love with the set of brushes because they leave your make up perfect and the brushes are well made.</li>
    <li> Like I&#x27;ve said before just as good and dense as sigma brushes!</li>
    <li> I like these brushes a lot and I think they are overall worth the price. Very dense and soft, and they do feel high quality, though the handles are a bit lightweight. I like the pointed foundation brush the most. It gives a smooth application and something about the shape makes it very pleasant to apply foundation. I probably use that one the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one downside, however, is that after a month or two, and VERY light usage (I have a lot of brushes and don&#x27;t reach for these often), two of the ferrules came loose and popped right off. The plus side is that they are cheap so I guess that&#x27;s to be expected, and it&#x27;s easy to glue them back together.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re ok. Two of the brushes came broken, so I took some wood glue and glued the handle back into the gold part. the bristles are soft but they did shed a alot when i was washing them. I guess I can&#x27;t complain for the price, If I could go back, I would have just payed more for the Sigma Kabuki brushes which I will be getting in the near future.</li>
    <li> Great brush set for the price. The bristles are very soft and blend very well and are very easy to clean</li>
    <li> Brushes are nice, contains soft hairs. Washes easily. Very good for applying blush and liquid foundation as well. No Cons.</li>
    <li> Seriously the best brushes I have purchased in a while. soft bristles, not at all hard on the face, Doesnt hold makeup actually carries it onto your face. Trust a random stranger and get them!1</li>
    <li> This item was delivered very fast.  The quality of this product is simply amazing, I couldn&#x27;t believe it especially for the price.  I will be ordering another set shortly.  I&#x27;m really excited about these.</li>
    <li> Good quality the price is even better compare this brushes to sigma f-80 and f-82 there the same just the price for one sigma brush u get all 4 brushes</li>
    <li> I bought this on a whim because I needed some stiff brushes for cream n liquid makeup. This is absolutely perfect.</li>
