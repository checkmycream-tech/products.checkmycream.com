<li> All needles and tubes have been properly packaged, and we have yet to come across any bad parts.</li>
<li> The reason I&#x27;m giving this a 4 star rating is because the variety is very poor.</li>

    <li> rate it 1000 out of a 100 best for tattooing easy and clean set up and easy * best for tattooing clean the best</li>
    <li> It came about 3 days later, I was surprised.</li>
    <li> All tubes had needles. Complete set. Good variety (4 of each): 3rl,5rl,7rl,9rl,3rs,5rs,7rs,9rs,7m1,9m1. Fast delivery. I only gave it 4 stars because they were packed super tight and am unsure if that affected the needles at all.</li>

    <li> Not the ast advertised</li>
    <li> This item showed up on time and from what I&#x27;ve used I haven&#x27;t seen any flaws, so far so good</li>
    <li> I ordered late evening on the 13 received by lunch on the 15. Haven&#x27;t tested product yet but all are sealed and packaged well, actually received a couple extra. Received 10 5m, 10 7rl, 10 7rs, 10 3rs, 10 9rs, not a wide range of needles but they made up by the extra 10.</li>
    <li> These are great. Came properly sealed but there isn&#x27;t an indicator on the packaging that labels if it&#x27;s sterile or not.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I have with these are that there isn&#x27;t much variety. It was all 3,5,7,9 RL, 3,5,7,9 RS, and barely any 5,7,9 M1s.&lt;br /&gt;All in all good quality but I wish they gave me a little more M1s for color packing.</li>
    <li> Yes, the quality of the needles and tubes was fine. The reason I&#x27;m giving this a 4 star rating is because the variety is very poor. You receive 95% Liners and Shaders and only 5% mags, which is what I really needed. Other than that, I am happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Product was recalled due to possible bacteria infection!!!!!! Seller/manufacturer did issue the recall and refunded all money</li>
