      <li>The BEST Dove scent ever and the exfoliating beads are awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>The scent: great!</li>
      <li>Smells great, and even has the exfoliating particles in it!</li>

      <li>I was extremely happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Awesome product, I just love the exfoliating</li>
      <li>This is the best, most refrshing soap ever.</li>
      <li>We really loved the feeling of the beads and the smell of the soap.</li>
      <li>The good thing buying from Amazon is its price.</li>
      <li>I will subscribe when all of this runs out :) which should be a while hah!</li>
      <li>My mother bought me this soap to try and I&#x27;m in love with it!</li>
      <li>I LOVE the exfoliating beads!</li>
      <li>Love this soap!  </li>
      <li>If you are a Dove fan, you&#x27;ll really love this one!</li>
      <li>so it feels nice when I feel the beads against my skin.</li>
      <li>, the price is nice though.</li>
      <li>Great product and quick delivery.</li>
      <li>I also love the nice scent of the grapefruit and lemonngrass too.</li>
      <li>So much that I ordered 24 bars on Amazon and am super happy with the purchase!</li>
      <li>I bought this soap on accident one day at CVS and fell in love with it.</li>
      <li>Glad to have found the Dove Grapefruit and Lemongrass bars!&lt;br /&gt;Hard</li>
      <li>So great to be able to still get the Dove Thanks</li>
      <li>This is my favorite bath soap.</li>
      <li>Now I have 24 soap bars that I don&#x27;t love.</li>
      <li>Better than any liquid soap.</li>
      <li>It is not milk and honey or some exotic soap, but it serves my purpose just right, namely, a good moisturizing soap.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell</li>
      <li>And this particular formula/scent is the best one the makers of Dove have developed.  </li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s silky smooth, and washes off easily.</li>
      <li>They were a bit old but they Still smell good.</li>
      <li>First of all, I love Dove soap.  </li>
      <li>If you are looking for the moisturizing properties of original Dove, this is not it.  </li>
      <li>It smells wonderful and has small granules which help exfoliate your skin.  </li>
      <li>but it does not moisturize as well as original Dove or Men&#x27;s Dove.  </li>
      <li>It is one of the best soaps for us general public.</li>
      <li>It is a fresh and clean smell and feel.</li>
      <li>favorite soap by far.</li>
      <li>It was the right quantity and the one With exfoliant beads.</li>
      <li>It leaves a clean, fresh scent &amp; it&#x27;s not heavy and does not leave any residue on your skin.</li>
      <li>and i hope i can get more in the future.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s smooth and creamy and leaves your skin feeling soft and moisturized.  </li>
      <li>Whenever I run out and have to use a different dove soap, I just don&#x27;t feel as clean.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>This soap leaves my skin soft and not dried out.  </li>
      <li>I would say it moisturizes 50% less than original Dove which is not enough for my skin</li>
      <li>They are terrific for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a huge bummer that I can&#x27;t purchase it in a regular bricks &amp; mortat store but at least I can buy it here!</li>

    <li> What can I say about the Dove soap!! It is one of the best soaps for us general public. It is not milk and honey or some exotic soap, but it serves my purpose just right, namely, a good moisturizing soap. The good thing buying from Amazon is its price. In earlier years, I used to get the Dove bar soap on sale for a dollar or 95 cents a piece if when buying a pack of 6 or 8 bars. However, with the state of economy and everything costing 25-30% higher than 2 years ago, I was unable to find a reasonable price for the Dove soap, until I got to the Amazon site. The Amazon price is great with a subscription, and I hope they keep it at this price for quite some time.</li>
    <li> The scent: great! but it used to be exfoliating and now is not. Now I have 24 soap bars that I don&#x27;t love. But still, I think is the best Dove scent in the market.</li>
    <li> I thought that I would never love bar soap in my entire life. I&#x27;ve always hated the strange residue that accompanies so many of the bars out there and it would often dry out my skin. My mother bought me this soap to try and I&#x27;m in love with it! I have combination skin and this has done wonders for it. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap on accident one day at CVS and fell in love with it. So much that I ordered 24 bars on Amazon and am super happy with the purchase! Smells great, and even has the exfoliating particles in it!</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and some people complained about the beads in the soap. I actually like them and is the reason why I have bought this soap time and time again. I have dry skin so it feels nice when I feel the beads against my skin. This is the only scent by Dove that has this quality. I also love the nice scent of the grapefruit and lemonngrass too.</li>
    <li> So great to be able to still get the Dove Thanks</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for about ten years. Suddenly I am having trouble buying in my local stores so I am going to order online. Whenever I run out and have to use a different dove soap, I just don&#x27;t feel as clean. I LOVE the exfoliating beads!</li>
    <li> First of all, I love Dove soap.  It&#x27;s best for my skin and it doesn&#x27;t leave soap residue on my skin or my shower walls.  And this particular formula/scent is the best one the makers of Dove have developed.  It&#x27;s smooth and creamy and leaves your skin feeling soft and moisturized.  If you are a Dove fan, you&#x27;ll really love this one!</li>
    <li> Cant believe I came online to buy soap!! Awesome product, I just love the exfoliating beads!&lt;br /&gt;My favorite soap by far. I will subscribe when all of this runs out :) which should be a while hah!</li>
    <li> This is the best, most refrshing soap ever. It&#x27;s a huge bummer that I can&#x27;t purchase it in a regular bricks &amp; mortat store but at least I can buy it here! It leaves a clean, fresh scent &amp; it&#x27;s not heavy and does not leave any residue on your skin. Better than any liquid soap.</li>
    <li> It was the right quantity and the one With exfoliant beads. They were a bit old but they Still smell good.</li>
    <li> The one I bought DOES have exfoliating beads in it, some reviewers received some without beads.  I would have given it five stars but it does not moisturize as well as original Dove or Men&#x27;s Dove.  If you are looking for the moisturizing properties of original Dove, this is not it.  I would say it moisturizes 50% less than original Dove which is not enough for my skin, the price is nice though.</li>
    <li> Love this soap!  The energy comes from little exfoliating beads inside of the soap.  It wakes you up as you&#x27;re cleansing and clears the dead skin away.  Double bonus!</li>
    <li> This soap leaves my skin soft and not dried out.  It smells great too. It is a fresh and clean smell and feel.</li>
    <li> Glad to have found the Dove Grapefruit and Lemongrass bars!&lt;br /&gt;Hard to find them now.  They are terrific for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite bath soap. It smells wonderful and has small granules which help exfoliate your skin.  I have bought it for years but can no longer find it in stores. Do not know if it is being discontinued or what. I was extremely happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> The BEST Dove scent ever and the exfoliating beads are awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This scent is not sold in stores anymore...I have to stock up by buying online.  Don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do when supply runs out!!!</li>
    <li> Great product and quick delivery.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using Dove for years and continue to like it a lot.  Doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, it&#x27;s silky smooth, and washes off easily.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s product has a crystal like sparkle to it . I feel this every time I shower. It&#x27;s just wonderful!</li>
    <li> My wife and i started using this soap about a year and a half ago. We really loved the feeling of the beads and the smell of the soap. Then Dove stopped selling it in our location? When i found it at Amazon  i bought 24 bars and i hope i can get more in the future.</li>
