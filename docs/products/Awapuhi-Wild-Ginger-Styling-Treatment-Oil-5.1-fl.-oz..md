    <li> I LOVE this product! My hair is color treated 2x mo and this product makes it look fabulous!!</li>
    <li> I have used this line before and love it!  This keeps my color treated hair from becoming dry.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff.  Works great on static hair.</li>
    <li> Lightweight. Works great on colored relaxed hair. Smells wonderful. Scent is light. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Paul Mitchell Ginger Treatment Oil is great for anyone who blow dries their hair. It makes my hair shine and doesn&#x27;t make it look oily. It has a clean refreshing smell, too.</li>
    <li> Works great on my dry hair. Recommended by my hair stylist. Plus this purchase was a great price.</li>
    <li> Love this s***! I buy a new bottle every couple months. Keeps my hair moisturized and smooth</li>
    <li> bought this at  salon and really like it. It&#x27;s a light consistency and applied on dry or wet hair its great. lots of shine without the goopy feeling of product. Plus it smells nice</li>
    <li> Okay, so I first used this product as part of a ginger kit it came in that I got as a gift from my hair stylist.  I have long, thick, wavy but very poofy and frizzy coarse hair.  I have used other salon oils and they were always super expensive and left my hair oily or made my blowout not last as long because my hair got oily faster.  Not this one.  But, it was pricey, so instead of re-purchasing it, I went to the drug store and tried to buy a cheaper oil as a replacement.  HUGE MISTAKE.  This oil is far superior to ANYTHING you can buy in the drug store.  Why?  Because it reduces drying time and frizz better than any other product I have used without weighing my hair down or making it look greasy.  It makes such a dramatic difference when trying to achieve a salon comparable blow-out at home yourself.  I would recommend this product to anyone regardless of hair type.  The only recommendation I would make is to place it on your ends first as they tell you to and then use the residue left on your hands for the top of your hair.  Best oil I have EVER used.</li>
    <li> Lightest oil I have found for hair - so silky.  Much better than Argon oil or any others out there.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t do without this product!! It tames my hair and makes it shine! A must have for dry hair types and for using a flat iron.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Makes my hair soft and shiny. Even for thin hair It&#x27;s not to heavy and greasy.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It is amazing.  I would recommend it to everyone I know.  The price is a little high, but worth it.</li>
    <li> I had obtained this product before through a local salon and loved it! It leaves my hair soft, shiny, feeling light. When it ran out, I ordered a bottle through Amazon and have not been disappointed. Same quality as the one from the salon.</li>
    <li> Best product keeps my hair in  control and soft</li>
    <li> My daughter who is a hair stylist turned me onto this product which you put on the ends of your hair after shampooing and conditioning.  It is not greasy but it keeps my hair from being so dry since I wash my hair every couple days and smells awesome!  I love it and would recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> I blow dry and flat iron my color-treated hair daily, and this has been a mane-saver, even with oil hair!</li>
    <li> LOVE this product and am glad I could find it here!</li>
    <li> I already reordered it twice. Absolutely love it! This product makes my life much easier. I use it every day after shampoo and this size lasts for about a year.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this Paul Mitchell Ginger treatment oil !  No awful smell . Smells delicious! Works really well without making your hair oily!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Use it as a crème rinse and it works great.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping. Great product and price.</li>
    <li> If you have problems with your hair once the humidity rises, this product is for you.  A sleek and shiny hair style with no fuss at all.  I apply a dime size of the product after washing and towel drying my hair then style away.  If the frizzies appear in between washing my hair, I use a small amount of product and get immediate smooth and shiny hair :-)  I carry a small travel size in my purse at all times.  Super product.</li>
    <li> Works great and smells awesome.</li>
    <li> Great product! Leaves hair soft and over time helps regain moisture.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing for my daughter&#x27;s fine, thin hair!  It doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or make it greasy, it adds beautiful shine and softness, which is wonderful - especially after her waist-long hair has taken a chlorine beating from swim lessons.</li>

    <li> I was sent the texturizing sea spray instead of the styling treatment oil and was charged much more for that item than what it sells for..</li>
    <li> LOVE this product.  High quality - great subtle fragrance.  Makes my waves hold in such a lovely, soft way. Another amazing Paul Mitchell product.</li>
    <li> This is a great way to moisturize my dry curls. I used to use this just at night for extra moisture. I&#x27;ve transitioned to using it during the day with the Wild Ginger Hydro-Cream Whip. It&#x27;s light weight and does a great job taming fly aways.</li>
    <li> This bottle will last forever my hair feels really healthy and smells so amazing.  The shipping of this product took a bit longer but worth it.</li>
    <li> Not greasy, doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all, has a very very faint light scent that is not offensive (and I have chemical and environmental sensitivities and this product does not aggravate my symptoms at all), makes my hair look beautiful!</li>
    <li> Was a gift for my sister for Christmas, she loved it, said was exactly what she wanted. Salons sell same product for twice the cost!</li>
    <li> Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Wild Ginger Styling Treatment  oil is a wonderful product. It has definitely improved the health of my hair.</li>
    <li> I used this product before it makes your hair strong reduces breakage it is light and does not weigh down the hair</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of this stuff. Im hooked. It smells amazing but its also my hair holy grail. When im in a hurry I just rub some of this in my hair and it looks healthy, shiny and less out of control. It doesnt have allot of hold like a styling gel/mouse/spray but it has a little. My boyfriend just started using it too...even he loves it.</li>
    <li> Great styling product. I have fine hair that tends to have a lot of static and tangle easily. This product keeps my hair from having static and keeps it from tangling as much, even in the wind! Plus, I feel like it helps my hair stay more moisturized (I live in very dry New Mexico) and manageable. Smells good too, and a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> smells amazing, works amazing. addicted after getting a sample a few years back, from the man himself!&lt;br /&gt;my hair is better for it.</li>
    <li> Love the big size and at a great price!  This oil is the only stuff that will keep my fine, wavy hair from frizzing and I have tried a ton of different products.</li>
    <li> Nice light oil that doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down or make it get greasy throughout the day. I only put one small pump on the ends of my hair and rub in while still wet. My hair is soft and silky. This size lasts roughly a year and I use it to refill the smaller size for traveling.</li>
    <li> I love this STUFF!! I purchased this oil at the recommendation of my hair stylist, who uses it on my hair at every visit to the salon.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the packaging is wonderful. This is a large bottle, but the design of the bottle is very nice. I really like the pump top, because I feel like it is easier to control how much product comes out. The bottle is large, but it fits in a large makeup bag with my makeup for traveling just fine.&lt;br /&gt;The oil, itself, is so light and it does not weigh the hair down or give it a greasy look. I use this oil most often when I have straightened my hair with a flat iron. It gives my straight locks a healthy shine. I just a put a few pumps into my hand and rub my hands together well. I glide my hands over the top of hair, then start to work the leftover oil into the underside of my hair. Then, I take a comb or brush to my hair to distribute it evenly. The end result is a beautiful shine, but it does NOT look greasy at all. This bottle lasts a long time, but I will definitely be buying again.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Use it almost everyday to tame my crazy curls.</li>
    <li> Nice and silky! I use it everyday after my shower. I do not dry my very long hair but with this product my hair combs easily and is smooth and straight all day.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend to hydrate hair!</li>
