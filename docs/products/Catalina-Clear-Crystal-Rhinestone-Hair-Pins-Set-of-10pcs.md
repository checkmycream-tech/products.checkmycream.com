    <li> The hair pins arrived quicker than expected, but I got a note from the owner in China. She said because of a typhoon I might get them late so let her know if I needed to return them.  They arrived in plenty of time for my son&#x27;s wedding. I wear my hair up and love these pins. I would recommend this company. I got them much earlier than I expected. I would not have returned them even if they came too late for the wedding. I will wear them for other occasions.</li>

    <li> I purchased these as an embellishment for my hair for my grandson&#x27;s wedding.  When they arrived I was very pleasantly surprised.  The quality was great, they are well made and oh so attractive.  I have gotten so many compliments on them and my hairdresser said she had never seen any pins of this quality for such a reasonable price.  Way to go,  I can&#x27;t wait for another occasion to come up so I can wear them again.</li>

    <li> They are more decoration that you can put over the already put in place hairdo. Look nice.</li>
    <li> I bought these pins last minute for my wedding and they arrived way before the estimated delivery date and they are beautiful. Much much bigger than I had expected. By the time they had arrived I had already decided to go another route for my accessories so I didn&#x27;t end up wearing these for my wedding. BUT they are still gorgeous and now I need to find another place to let them shine.</li>
    <li> I received these hair pins in an expedient amount of time. The seller was quite responsive and the pins are just as they appear. They are best for people with rather thick hair, and are relatively big. So, if you are looking for some fun bling in your hair for a special occasion, these are good ones to get.</li>
    <li> Absolutely beautiful, although some of the crystals fall out easily so handle with care.</li>
    <li> Love these. Looks great in any hairdo but especially an updo.</li>
