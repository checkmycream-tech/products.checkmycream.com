<li> I expected the same value.  </li>
<li> Yes, I got the Mascara, but it looks like someone already used and it is dry.</li>
<li> Soon after receiving this item, I came down with a double-eye infection.</li>
<li> Definitely waterproof and makes lashes look thick, but a little clumpy.  </li>
<li> THIS MASCARA DOES NOT LEAVE BLACK UNDER YOUR EYES....</li>
<li> A FEW TIMES</li>
<li> It seems to be a replica which the bottle is different and the mascara is too thin.</li>
<li> Sorry, but the box was open as well</li>
<li> Not pleased!</li>
<li> I am very disappointed with this purchase.</li>

    <li> Soon after receiving this item, I came down with a double-eye infection. This product was purposely purchased because I liked the first lash love mascara bought from MK warehouse.  I expected the same value.  Have been on antibiotic eye drops for 7 days now. waking up every morning with eyes sealed together from goop created from the infection.  I hope the mascara was not previously used as a sampler, or old shelf-life that causes you to sell on Amazon.  Please advise.</li>
    <li> Love it. My favorite Mascara~</li>
    <li> Very happy to find this outlet for this product. It works best for me of any mascara I have used and doesn&#x27;t break out my eyes.</li>
    <li> Yes, I got the Mascara, but it looks like someone already used and it is dry. I paid good enough to receive it this way. Sorry, but the box was open as well</li>
    <li> I ordered waterproof, but received the regular mascara? So I gave it to my daughter! Not pleased!</li>
    <li> I love this mascara.  I wear contacts and never have to worry about my mascara running if my eyes water.</li>
    <li> It was not waterproof. The box did not state waterproof, only the homemade sticker placed on the item. I am very disappointed with this purchase.</li>
    <li> love this mascara and the lengthening without clumps</li>
    <li> Love this mascara!  Stays on all day with no smudging.  Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> The only waterproof mascara that works without clumping!</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve used the product twice and o really like it.</li>
    <li> Definitely waterproof and makes lashes look thick, but a little clumpy.  Doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
    <li> THIS MASCARA DOES NOT LEAVE BLACK UNDER YOUR EYES....IT LASTS ALL DAY!&lt;br /&gt;YOU ONLY NEED TO BRUSH YOUR LASHES A FEW TIMES AND IT LOOKS GREAT.</li>
    <li> I have been using Mary K products close to a year now! The primer,timeless foundation,&amp; blush work great together. Then add the mascara and eye liner you have a great finish to your makeup!</li>
    <li> Waterproof.  Skinny brush makes it easy to fill in corner lashes.  Does take a few coats, but good mascara.  Fast delivery. Great price.</li>
    <li> Love this waterproof mascara, it is the best I have tried.</li>
    <li> the product is different from my expectation and what is posted online.&lt;br /&gt;  It seems to be a replica which the bottle is different and the mascara is too thin.</li>
