### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great Product!!</li>
      <li>Benton products are the best!</li>
      <li>Wonderful, non-oily serum.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy to use it as part of my face care routine.</li>
      <li>Excellent - that is, until it expires within 2 weeks.</li>
      <li>The pump dispenses the perfect mount for the face, I use another pump for my neck and decolletage.</li>
      <li>Excellent product.  </li>
      <li>I use it after hada labo gokyujun toner (also very great for adding moisture) and before my lotions and creams.</li>
      <li>Very good.  </li>
      <li>Great addition to skin care.</li>
      <li>This was a great addition to my skincare routine.</li>
      <li>I am so happy I went ahead and ordered this.</li>
      <li>Nothing great about this product.</li>
      <li>and I have experienced no irritation or breakouts.</li>

      <li>love this stuff!!  </li>
      <li>but I love this stuff!!</li>
      <li>It has evened my skin tone very nicely and brightened my complexion.</li>
      <li>I just wish it were effective on my skin!</li>
      <li>I am planning on purchasing more for friends and family as gifts, as it is so great!</li>
      <li>I think this keeps my skin glowing and bright and seems to plump it a bit as well.</li>
      <li>My skin loves me again, and looks bright</li>
      <li>but I think 21 is a good age to start taking care of my skin.</li>
      <li>I bought this product to help lighten my freckles; while I haven&#x27;t noticed a drastic difference, my skin is sillky smooth and otherwise flawless.</li>
      <li>Good communication from seller.  </li>
      <li>Again, for that you&#x27;d need a good exfoliant, laser treatments, or just time.tation.</li>
      <li>so I was looking for a good and affordable essence.</li>
      <li>like I do, I suggest using a skin softener or moisturizer fairly soon after application of this product to seal it in properly.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
      <li>Again, for that you&#x27;d need a good exfoliant, laser treatments, or just time.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m super impressed by the results.</li>
      <li>What a lovely product!</li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed it&#x27;s great for relaxing the fine lines under my eyes.</li>
      <li>extremely* healthy, bright, and awake.</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
      <li>Read a bunch of amazing reviews here, but it did nothing for my skin</li>
      <li>This serum is amazing.</li>
      <li>Nice to use, don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s doing anything.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s unscented and i think it makes for a nice every day product.</li>
      <li>Watery and nice, it doesn&#x27;t upset my skin at all.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Results wise, I love this stuff, it helps my skin heal faster from &amp;#34;troubles&amp;#34; or injuries, and I use this on both myself and my son when we get bug bites.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is not a moisturizer, so you can&#x27;t use it on its own.</li>
      <li>im loving this one..</li>
      <li>Edit: if you have any kind of dust mite allergy, you may want to skip out on snail mucin products.</li>
      <li>Also love that it is fragrance free and packaged in a pump bottle!!</li>
      <li>While the product is moisturizing on its own, I think it works best in tandem with a lotion, especially if you plan to use it at night.</li>
      <li>This serum goes on very smooth, but despite using for 6 weeks, I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in skin texture or scar appearance.</li>
      <li>The packaging says it&#x27;s an &amp;#34;essence,&amp;#34; but I consider it more of a very light gel.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure the whitening proprieties of this product aided that process a bit.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s mostly oily and this plus</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad that they have it for Prime..</li>
      <li>like all of the benton products, i&#x27;m not in love with it either.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I will update some more when I use it</li>
      <li>I love this essence.</li>
      <li>It came on time and it is so cute and pristine looking.</li>
      <li>I love this.</li>
      <li>I wanted to love it</li>
      <li>It makes my face more hydrated and shrinks my pores around nose area as well.</li>
      <li>Again, it wasn&#x27;t a holy grail type of product for me, but it is for many people.</li>
      <li>Probably my favorite part of my skin care regime.</li>
      <li>Now, I don&#x27;t know about all that, but I do love this product.</li>
      <li>My skin seems healthier than it did before, and it is certainly more moisturized.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for maybe 2-3 weeks and it has been awesome at reducing redness in my skin and providing a bit of moisture.  </li>
      <li>Love, love, love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that if I use more than one pump, not all of the product absorbs into my skin, leaving a tacky film on</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll be better off getting an exfoliant for that.</li>
      <li>Pretty good stuff.</li>
      <li>I love it, it has made my face more smooth</li>
      <li>Her wrinkles look more smooth.</li>
      <li>I will update this review with more detailed information when I have had a chance to assess the serum longer.</li>
      <li>Came 2 weeks early in very nice and secured package, along with a mark sample.</li>
      <li>so it spreads easily.</li>
      <li>I strongly recommend.</li>
      <li>It feels good on my face, and absorbs pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>My face feels moisturized and super smooth!</li>
      <li>I use one pump of this nightly and dab it on my forehead, cheeks, chin, under my eyes, and wherever else fine lines may try to sneak up on me then lightly pat it into my skin.</li>
      <li>As I had fairly good skin before using this product, I don&#x27;t know if there was a -huge- impact as far as results.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s just a nice absorbing light feeling.</li>
      <li>but it goes away, this can be overlooked considering how clear and bright it has kept my skin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I think this product is most useful for people who are dealing with acne and redness.</li>
      <li>Free samples were sent also.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the price and effort to ship this product from SK!</li>
      <li>I always use this product after toner and it goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>My product arrived safe and sound, with fast shipping and since it was winter, no issues with preservation.</li>
      <li>Goes on so smoothly and absorbs quickly with minimum stickiness.  </li>
      <li>I really wanted to love this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the Tony Moly Intense Care Snail Eye Mask and LOVE it.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to love this</li>
      <li>If you already have skin that looks okay, it might not do too much for you.</li>
      <li>This essence is surprisingly hydrating enough that I sometimes feel I can skip my moisturizer when using it, depending on how my skin feels that day.</li>
      <li>Smells so clean and fresh.</li>
      <li>The gel is translucent and scentless, and it absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
      <li>In 2015, I should not have to worry about products turning on me so quickly because of shipping temperatures.</li>
      <li>It also helps to heal breakouts quickly.</li>
      <li>However, I think that this is a worthy product given how inexpensive it is.</li>
      <li>and it is so gentle and smooth.</li>
      <li>Like many fans of Asian beauty, I enjoy this product.  </li>
      <li>Clear, unscented (not even a &#x27;chemical&#x27; smell to be noticed), and like most essences, the consistency is somewhat watery/liquid-ey</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> im loving this one..ill order another bottle for sure.</li>
    <li> Quite helpful. Definite improvement in my skin.</li>
    <li> This serum is amazing. I&#x27;ve just recently gotten into korean skincare products and im totally sold. First time I used this I noticed a difference. There is no fragrance, it absorbs super quick and absolutely no grease whatsoever. My face feels moisturized and super smooth! Benton products are the best!</li>
    <li> Wonderful, non-oily serum.  Unlike any other lotion I&#x27;ve used, I&#x27;ve been able to use it on oily or blemished areas with no negative effects.  I was a little apprehensive about the question of potential irritation caused by its snail and bee venom ingredients, since I have hyper-sensitive skin, but this serum has been totally non-irritating.  In fact, any number of standard drugstore products have irritated me severely, so for all of you out there with sensitive skin, I can say as someone with very sensitive skin that this serum didn&#x27;t cause me any problems at all.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It came on time and it is so cute and pristine looking.</li>
    <li> Works wonders on calming down my skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. Especially for the price. My order came on the very last of the estimated arrival dates, so I was prepared for the wait. Who knew that I was being mailed such gold? I have very sensitive, easily congested skin and this is enough for me on most days to hydrate. (Moisturizers tend to be too much for me, so I stick to things that are water based.) I recently came back from a stay in New Zealand during their summer, where they have a VERY STRONG sun (way harsher than LA&#x27;s), with a bit of a healing burn. After using this and the Aloe BHA toner for a mere few days, the skin was so improved. This is truly a HEALING, hydrating, regulating product that I can&#x27;t rave enough about and has converted me both to snail mucus in skincare and this specific line. I strongly recommend.</li>
    <li> Absorb fast. Provide moisture to skin</li>
    <li> I use one pump of this nightly and dab it on my forehead, cheeks, chin, under my eyes, and wherever else fine lines may try to sneak up on me then lightly pat it into my skin. Miraculously one pump of this essence manages to put a thin layer over just about my entire face! Since I&#x27;ve used it regularly my skin tone has evened out, my fine lines are diminishing, and it REALLY helped with my breakouts and redness in general! Will definitely be repurchasing when I run out.</li>
    <li> I love this. I have oily skin and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin greasy. It doesn&#x27;t make me break out. I don&#x27;t have wrinkles but I think 21 is a good age to start taking care of my skin. I tried this on my mom and it really makes a big difference. She is 64 and have wrinkles and this product makes my mom face really different. Her wrinkles look more smooth.</li>
    <li> I just ordered the second bottle. I love it. If you are the first time user, just give it some time.. I really had dry skin with some red spots but my skin is now so smooth and not much red spots as before. When I first used it, I thought I had allergy reaction so I only used every other day and after my skin got adjusted to this, I started using it everyday. I actually see results. I apply it on my face (like two pumps?) and gently massage for about 1-2min and I also use the Snail cream from Benton. I like the fact that it has no chemical smell at all and it is so gentle and smooth. I highly recommend it! I&#x27;m so glad that they have it for Prime..thank god.</li>
    <li> Excellent - that is, until it expires within 2 weeks. In 2015, I should not have to worry about products turning on me so quickly because of shipping temperatures. The preservative system in this product is extremely weak, so unless you can use up 60 ml of product within 2 weeks or ensure that this product does not ever exceed room temperature, I would definitely not recommend this. If they add parabens to the formulation or a stronger preservative system I will consider purchasing again (and only in the winter).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not see any miraculous results, but my skin seemed to heal faster and had a slightly nicer texture up until the product began to turn. After the two week mark the product turned from a light gel into a strange liquid and there was a little whiteish chunk of something or other, I&#x27;m assuming mold or a bacterial growth.... after another two weeks or so the entire bottle was full of it. The product which was initially scentless, turned absolutely putrid. I had used it when the texture became watery several times unfortunately, which led to some pretty bad breakouts around my chin that lasted for around 3 weeks but fortunately did not stay after that. The manufacture date was after the &#x27;scandal&#x27; of last year, so I&#x27;m extremely disappointed that they have not changed the way they formulate this product. Don&#x27;t be afraid of parabens, guys. They keep your skincare and makeup from pulling s**t like this product did on me.</li>
    <li> Is very hydrating, soothing, and worth the price. I am planning on purchasing more for friends and family as gifts, as it is so great! It isn&#x27;t sticky, so you can apply it and almost immediately put on makeup.</li>
    <li> This has really helped with the dark marks on my face from previous eczema flareups. It goes on smoothly and absorbs quick enough. I&#x27;m very happy to use it as part of my face care routine.</li>
    <li> Pretty good stuff.It is lightning darker pigmented skin.Goes on well.Not heavy.I have combination skin,and it is working very well,no breakouts,and just enough moisture.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really know that I see any difference at all in my skin using this product.  I notice no difference, neither negatively nor positively.  It&#x27;s very thin, goes on like a watery serum.  Slight smell, but nothing major.  I just wish it were effective on my skin!</li>
    <li> Added this in with the other South Korean products I use daily. I broke out in weird red rashes, stopped using it and my skin went back to normal. I&#x27;m going to stick with the Missha Essence instead. It may be more expensive, but it&#x27;s a bigger bottle and my face looks great when it&#x27;s apart of my daily routine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m aware there were some issues with this brand due to their preservatives and spoilage. That being said, I personally have not had this issue at all. My product arrived safe and sound, with fast shipping and since it was winter, no issues with preservation. The consistency of this essence is a like a watery gel, and for those unfamiliar with the multi-step process, this would go after your toner.&lt;br /&gt;Results wise, I love this stuff, it helps my skin heal faster from &amp;#34;troubles&amp;#34; or injuries, and I use this on both myself and my son when we get bug bites.</li>
    <li> Nothing great about this product. Read a bunch of amazing reviews here, but it did nothing for my skin and I&#x27;m highly disappointed. Did not help fade any redness or scarring. Keeps my face refreshed after applying, but that&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> Really helps the redness in my face! I would highly recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> Based on the reviews and product description, I was excited to try out this product, especially after having been recommended here by Skin &amp; Tonics. I have acne scars and sensitive, combination dry-oily skin, so I was hoping this essence would help fade some of those scars/improve my skin&#x27;s appearance in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, my skincare routine can do without this product. I see no difference in my skin after having used this product for 2+ months, which is frustrating because, well, I spent money on it so I hope to at least see some sort of results. I will not be buying again. 2 stars because the product did not break me out.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;d live without this.  I&#x27;m almost 40 and my snail bee is keeping me looking like a kid.  Photo taken today.</li>
    <li> It does what it says it does. I have very sensitive combination skin that&#x27;s mostly oily and this plus thayers rosewater witch hazel as a toner has worked miracles for me. when I have dryness or a rash on my face, I put this on and the pain and redness goes away. I have been using this stuff for about 3 weeks steadily now and my acne scars have already faded quite a lot. I know it&#x27;s this because before I added this to my skincare routine I would have the worst told getting my scars to fade and they would keep getting inflamed. not when I use this! I want to try out the steam cream now too for the dry patches on my face and as a nightly moisturizer. Was skeptical at first when someone recommended this to me but I love this stuff!!</li>
    <li> I really really like this! I&#x27;ve only been using it for maybe 2-3 weeks and it has been awesome at reducing redness in my skin and providing a bit of moisture.  I used to get bad redness around my chin and nostrils but now the redness has greatly reduced.  Just a good idea to store in cold, dark places (even the fridge) as Benton supposedly only uses natural preservatives.</li>
    <li> I love this essence. It&#x27;s calming, soothing, and slightly moisturizing. It&#x27;s colorless, fragrance-free, and has a thin gel texture. The pump dispenses the perfect mount for the face, I use another pump for my neck and decolletage. It sinks in quickly and does not leave any stickiness or residue behind. I do not breakout or react to this in any way. In fact, if I&#x27;m over-zealous in trying new products or over-exfoliating, I turn to a minimal routine with this essence and other products that I don&#x27;t react to until things calm down. Coming from a western style beauty routine, working with multiple products to layer in moisture and treatments has been a challenge, but ultimately, my skin is looking better and better every day. I use this after my toner and &amp;#34;actives&amp;#34; (AHA/BHA/VIt C) and before serums and moisturizer.</li>
    <li> My skin tends to be dry/flaky/red and this stuff does wonders to calm it down. It&#x27;s moisturizing without making my skin feel greasy and has not caused a single breakout. This is one product that I simply cannot be without.</li>
    <li> I am so happy I went ahead and ordered this. I used it with my routine of cleansing, then toner, this essence followed by the Snail Bee Steam Cream. My skin loves me again, and looks bright and I can tell my skin tone has already started to even out.</li>
    <li> This is the first &amp;#34;snail slime&amp;#34; product I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;m super impressed by the results. I pat it on after cleansing and before serum and moisturizer. 1-2 quick pumps will do, sinks in nicely with no stickiness. It smells like balls sweat at first but it goes away, this can be overlooked considering how clear and bright it has kept my skin.</li>
    <li> Nice to use, don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s doing anything.</li>
    <li> Like many fans of Asian beauty, I enjoy this product.  The packaging says it&#x27;s an &amp;#34;essence,&amp;#34; but I consider it more of a very light gel. While the product is moisturizing on its own, I think it works best in tandem with a lotion, especially if you plan to use it at night. The gel is translucent and scentless, and it absorbs quickly into the skin. I&#x27;ve noticed that if I use more than one pump, not all of the product absorbs into my skin, leaving a tacky film on top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main ingredient, snail mucin, has quite the reputation abroad. Cosmetics companies laud its many supposed benefits, such as improving skin elasticity, boosting collagen production, evening skin tone, etc. Now, I don&#x27;t know about all that, but I do love this product. After using it for the better part of a year, I think that I&#x27;ve incurred enough benefit to repurchase. My skin seems healthier than it did before, and it is certainly more moisturized. I don&#x27;t really believe the manufacturer&#x27;s claims that this can firm up or even out your skin. However, I think that this is a worthy product given how inexpensive it is.</li>
    <li> Many Asian Beauty users swear by snail bee essence, so don&#x27;t let my ho-hum review deter you from taking a shot. Just know that it&#x27;s not a miracle cure for everyone (maybe everyone but me). I used this product daily until I used up the bottle. It lasted for several months, which was a perk. However, I did not observe any noticeable improvement to my skin overall. It has a bit of an odd scent, but alas, it is snail bee essence, so it&#x27;s to be expected. It soaked in quickly but left my skin feeling a little tight. Not problematic, though, as I followed it up with a hyaluronic serum and moisturizer. Again, it wasn&#x27;t a holy grail type of product for me, but it is for many people.</li>
    <li> This is a clear gel-like texture, with no scent at all. It makes my face more hydrated and shrinks my pores around nose area as well.</li>
    <li> I read other reviews before I bought snail Bee High Content Essence. Been using this for 2 weeks now. I have noticed my skin getting much clearer.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It has evened my skin tone very nicely and brightened my complexion.</li>
    <li> Came 2 weeks early in very nice and secured package, along with a mark sample. I will update some more when I use it</li>
    <li> The item shipped very fast, I ordered it from package_go_fast and it came with three samples, I only used it today and i&#x27;ll update it how it works, but a lot of beauty blogs name this as one of their holy grails&lt;br /&gt;It goes on very thin without any gel feeling, and it doesn&#x27;t really have a smell to it. It doesn&#x27;t stink or make me breakout in hives or anything because of the bee venom, it&#x27;s just a nice absorbing light feeling.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Will order again</li>
    <li> Goes on so smoothly and absorbs quickly with minimum stickiness.  I use this with Benton toner and steam cream and noticed smoother skin in a couple of weeks.  The only negative thing is 60cc is not a lot :(</li>
    <li> First things first:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Calms redness, rosacea flushes&lt;br /&gt;Helps acne heal much faster&lt;br /&gt;Lightly moisturizes&lt;br /&gt;Slight plumping effect&lt;br /&gt;Amazing ingredient list&lt;br /&gt;No fillers&lt;br /&gt;Even works on mosquito bites! Seriously, it stops the itching right away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months and there haven&#x27;t been any&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry, sensitive skin, and I&#x27;ve been blessed with acne and mild rosacea, as well as a sensitivity to certain ingredients that are in the vast majority of western skincare products. As a result, I&#x27;ve had to keep my skincare extremely simple for the past several years. This was the first product I tried that wasn&#x27;t a natural oil, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Snail mucin, green tea extract, niacinamide, bee venom, willow bark extract, aloe leaf extract, allantoin, and azelaic acid are some of my favorite ingredients and they&#x27;re all conveniently packed in one essence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some things you should be aware of, if you haven&#x27;t used Korean essences before:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it has snail mucin and bee venom, and it&#x27;s amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a moisturizer, so you can&#x27;t use it on its own. It does help moisturize your skin, but it definitely won&#x27;t be the main player in keeping your skin from drying out. I use it in conjunction with other essences as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use this after you wash your face, and put your heavier products on top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this product is most useful for people who are dealing with acne and redness. If you already have skin that looks okay, it might not do too much for you. If you have texture issues that are not due to irritation or lack of moisture, don&#x27;t expect any miracles. You&#x27;ll be better off getting an exfoliant for that. Also, contrary to some claims going around, I don&#x27;t think you can expect to see any lightening of scars and pigmentation. I think if you do see an improvement it is temporary. Again, for that you&#x27;d need a good exfoliant, laser treatments, or just time.tation. I think if you do see an improvement it is temporary.

    <li> I always use this product after toner and it goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly. No scent and moisturizes well. I&#x27;ve used the Tony Moly Intense Care Snail Eye Mask and LOVE it. Does wonders for moisturizing the delicate eye area and is long lasting. I feel like this does the same for the rest of my face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s doing anything good to my face, but it&#x27;s not doing anything bad either. It makes my skin feel nice right out of the shower and doesn&#x27;t dry me out...Will finish the bottle and see what happens then. (:</li>
    <li> Great Product!! Love the thin texture of this essence. It spreads well, and absorbs into the skin. It hydrates well, without being oily. I can use it day and night without any issues. The only drawback is that I haven&#x27;t noticed dramatic changes in my skin, just hydration, but I still love it. Also love that it is fragrance free and packaged in a pump bottle!! Recommended.</li>
    <li> Used this 2x/day for several months now, as a preventative for aging effects and also general skincare. It feels good on my face, and absorbs pretty quickly. Will probably buy again when the rest is gone!</li>
    <li> Very good.  Good communication from seller.  Only been using 2 weeks so cannot gauge much now.  I have very sensitive skin and tis has caused no irritation.</li>
    <li> My skin: dry, sensitive, a few pores around the sides of my nose. I use an oil cleanser (Tatcha) or Cetaphil to wash with, and exfoliate once a week with a powder exfoliant (also Tatcha).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product: Clear, unscented (not even a &#x27;chemical&#x27; smell to be noticed), and like most essences, the consistency is somewhat watery/liquid-ey so it spreads easily. I use 1 and 1/2 pumps to cover my whole face, or 2 pumps if I want to cover my neck as well. I generally use this twice a day, or however many times I cleanse my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results: As I had fairly good skin before using this product, I don&#x27;t know if there was a -huge- impact as far as results. However, I did notice my skin had a bit more of a healthy glow, and definitely brightened up overall. I&#x27;m sure the whitening proprieties of this product aided that process a bit. I&#x27;ve gotten quite a few compliments on my skin since I added this to my skincare regime although I do have a few notes--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. If you have dry skin like I do, I suggest using a skin softener or moisturizer fairly soon after application of this product to seal it in properly.&lt;br /&gt;2. Don&#x27;t be discouraged if you break out in a few small pimples after starting--I had a 2-3 small ones the first week or so, then they cleared up and I haven&#x27;t had a breakout since (I generally stick with a product for 10 days before making any final decisions on it)..&lt;br /&gt;3. This product DOES contain arbutin--I know some people don&#x27;t like to use &#x27;unnatural&#x27; products and are wary of using skin lightening products, so just know that this essence does contain some.</li>
    <li> Exceeded expectation!! Dramatic results in a few days.Skin was soft and supple firm and glowing.Great non greasy absorbtion did not cause breakout like oil based products.Will be added to my regular routine.Cant use oil based products on my face so it is hard to find something that does exactly as promised.I am looking forward to trying the cream and other products in the line on hands and body to see how it works .Fantastic .</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, the snail + bee venom combination is horrible for my skin! I really wanted to love this product. I&#x27;ve heard it did wonders on other people&#x27;s skin. On my face, it created pimples and random red spots. I thought it was another product, so I started testing all the skin care products I used on my skin. It was this essence that caused the acne and redness on my face... So sad, I hope it works on other people&#x27;s skin. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin. My skin is on the dry side so I was looking for a good and affordable essence. I am probably allergic to some of the ingredients. I also tried the Benton BHA aloe and did the same on my face.</li>
    <li> snails! bees! this is not a miracle product and, like the other benton products i bought, i&#x27;ll probably try a different brand whent his runs out just because there are so many great korean serums and essences out there. this absorbs quickly, but i&#x27;m also using it up pretty fast, i think it is helping to heal some of my acne scarring, but i use so many products that it&#x27;s hard to tell what&#x27;s because of the snail bee essence and what&#x27;s because of retinol, arbutin, various sheet masks, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;like all the benton products, it&#x27;s unscented and i think it makes for a nice every day product. like all of the benton products, i&#x27;m not in love with it either.</li>
    <li> This was a great addition to my skincare routine. I use it after cleansing and before applying serums and my moisturizer. It feels lovely on the skin and eases that tight uncomfortable feeling I get after cleansing but before moisturizing. It sinks into skin instantly, is not sticky, is not heavy, has no scent. My skin is oily and acne prone but also sensitive and I have experienced no irritation or breakouts. I think this keeps my skin glowing and bright and seems to plump it a bit as well. At 29 I am not seeing any major signs of aging but this has helped with the few fine lines I have. This essence is surprisingly hydrating enough that I sometimes feel I can skip my moisturizer when using it, depending on how my skin feels that day. Will definitely repurchase!</li>
    <li> Already a part of my regimen. Will reorder again. Can&#x27;t explain it but skin feels great.</li>
    <li> Watery and nice, it doesn&#x27;t upset my skin at all. The seller, Jolseusa, sent me a product that was manufactured within the month I recieved it (Jan 2015) which is good if you worry about the contaminated batch early last year. Like the lotion, it smells like dirt, which I&#x27;m not happy about but can deal with. It&#x27;s a very watery texture and spreads thinly.</li>
    <li> This product soothes irritation and redness without any stinging or further irritation. Its my holy grail for when I overexfoliate.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this but it broke me out so bad. I heard that if you are allergic to dust you are probably allergic to snails as well. I am allergic to dust and it&#x27;s likely the acne I got from this was allergy related. Too bad.</li>
    <li> What a lovely product! I&#x27;ve been using this twice a day for the past two weeks and it&#x27;s truly a wonder. I bought this product to help lighten my freckles; while I haven&#x27;t noticed a drastic difference, my skin is sillky smooth and otherwise flawless. Although some reviewers stated that this product caused them to break out, this never happened to me. Definitely worth the price and effort to ship this product from SK!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month and a half in conjunction with a Korean skincare regimen. I purchased this because of its ridiculously high ratings here on Amazon, but IMO, it&#x27;s pretty obvious that those reviews are all positive in exchange for receiving the product. This serum goes on very smooth, but despite using for 6 weeks, I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in skin texture or scar appearance. I will not be buying again.</li>
    <li> I have very dry, sensitive skin and this essence hydrates,calms it down and makes my face look smoother. It has also helped a bit with acne. I use it after hada labo gokyujun toner (also very great for adding moisture) and before my lotions and creams. I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see a difference in acne scars.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this stuff. Smells so clean and fresh. Probably my favorite part of my skin care regime.</li>
    <li> love the product and it was received in less than two weeks.  Free samples were sent also.</li>
    <li> I like this Essence, I am going to buy it again.</li>
    <li> Edit: if you have any kind of dust mite allergy, you may want to skip out on snail mucin products. Eventually, this product began to cause itchy cystic acne on my chin and cheeks. I wanted to love it my allergies are too strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff!!  It has helped with some strangely itchy acne I&#x27;ve been dealing with- it&#x27;s still there but less itchy/inflamed. It absorbs nicely and doesn&#x27;t stay sticky as long as I don&#x27;t use too much. My skin is oily/combination, if that helps.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a short time but so far I like the product. I haven&#x27;t had any skin sensitivity issues yet either. I will update this review with more detailed information when I have had a chance to assess the serum longer.</li>
    <li> The #1 product for evening and brightening my skin tone. I&#x27;ve never had dull skin, but this product makes my skin look *extremely* healthy, bright, and awake. It also helps to heal breakouts quickly. I&#x27;m very fair, so red marks usually last several weeks on my skin before fading. This, in combination with exfoliating products, fades them in a week. Using it daily also seems to prevent larger breakouts -- blemishes that would normally become whiteheads heal before they have a chance to erupt. 100% holy grail product for me. Snail Bee, never leave me.</li>
    <li> not really sure if this product does much for me. i haven&#x27;t really noticed a dramatic difference but i haven&#x27;t had any negative effects. has no scent which is a plus.</li>
    <li> Wish I could have this stuff on tap at any time. It&#x27;s so gentle and soothing, and it incorporates EGF to repair skin, which is a big deal for me. I&#x27;ve noticed it&#x27;s great for relaxing the fine lines under my eyes. 60 ml doesn&#x27;t seem like a lot, but it spreads so easily that you really only need the tiiiniest dab to cover half your face. It&#x27;s very affordable for how high quality the ingredients are. If you want just snail slime you can get a jar of 300 ml of pure snail slime for about the same price, but you won&#x27;t get the bee venom and EGF in that case, which are really beneficial. And it won&#x27;t be as concentrated in that case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you pair this with their BHA toner you will have no pores or wrinkles. Seriously. Skip their steam cream, though, it sucks and makes you break out.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this but it just makes me get giant pimples in places I never got them before</li>
    <li> Thank you. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great addition to skin care. I love it, it has made my face more smooth and I have less outbreaks lately. I would highly recommend this item, it helps relieve the dry skin which I have after washing my face. Even with the gently cleansers, somehow my face always ends up dry. This helps relieve the dryness. It is a small bottle, but it has lasted me over 2+ months, and I use it for day and night (one pump each time).</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel it has improved my skin</li>
</ol>
