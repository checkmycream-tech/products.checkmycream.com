      <li>I love this serum and works well with my type of hair</li>
      <li>The item I ordered was for two 4.2 ounce bottles and amazon.com sent me one 4.2 ounce bottle and one 6 ounce bottle - so I got much more than I was expecting.  </li>
      <li>like so many unsealed beauty products on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Unless you&#x27;re going to spend 4-10x more money-- if you have hair anything like mine, you&#x27;ll love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>dime size) applied to my medium length, not thick hair keeps my hair looking &amp; feeling great</li>
      <li>but gel makes it more easy to shape my hair</li>
      <li>The hair was silky smooth, shiny, and tangle free!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s fine to use on unwashed hair-</li>
      <li>Instead, it made the top of my hair look SUPER greasy.</li>
      <li>too fine and too light weight.  ]</li>
      <li>but i guess that is the reason as to why it was so cheap</li>
      <li>light brownish hair.  </li>
      <li>buy 2 get 1 free...</li>
      <li>This works better than the Aveda serum, which I spend more than twice as much for before I discovered this product.</li>
      <li>Love this product, it really helps!  </li>
      <li>One method was to use oil and another more popular method was to use a flat iron.</li>
      <li>My hair feels very silky and smooth, and you can&#x27;t beat the price!  </li>
      <li>I love it that much.</li>
      <li>Just recently, I heard about got2b&#x27;s version on the Cosmetics Cop radio show - they rated it a best beauty buy for under ten dollars.  </li>
      <li>ive used paul mitchell&#x27;s super skinny serum for years...</li>
      <li>So, I decided to try it, mainly because you get so much more product for the money over Frizz-Ease.  </li>
      <li>I use this product daily and love it!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty sweet.</li>
      <li>It gives my hair a beautiful shine but doesn&#x27;t leave it gummy or hard to manage.  </li>
      <li>I love it better than my old standard!  </li>
      <li>This method also works great on synthetic, human, and human hair weaves.</li>
      <li>came very fast and was exactly what was pictured.  </li>
      <li>I must say it was more synthetic than human, I learned my lesson there.</li>
      <li>AND amazon actually sent me more than I ordered.</li>
      <li>definitely noticed my hair was smoother after using this! :)</li>
      <li>I really like this serum!</li>
      <li>This is the only hair gel that makes my frizzy hair look OK.  </li>
      <li>However, I use quite a bit and seem to go through a bottle pretty fast so this is economical for me.  </li>
      <li>This is a good product but the bottle is messy.</li>
      <li>it stops the frizz (which many other products I have tried don&#x27;t do it effectively) and does not weigh down my fine curly hair....</li>
      <li>Now I don&#x27;t have to waste my money buying replacement wig after wig because I can make a cheap heat safe synthetic look like indian remy hair.</li>
      <li>Most people throw away these types of wigs after a month because they get so dry tangled and scraggly looking.</li>
      <li>It easily washes out in your next shower with a bit of conditioner.</li>
      <li>She used to buy single bottles at the store for much more, but now we buy these.</li>
      <li>If I were you, I&#x27;d buy this straight away because it&#x27;s a fantastic deal, and these bottles will last you forever, since you need a miniscule amount of serum to style.</li>
      <li>And my girlfriend really likes it (the look, smell, and feel).  </li>
      <li>I have a lot of frizz in the front of my hair where you really can&#x27;t hide much.  </li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t frizz up as much</li>
      <li>but this one clouds over and seems much greasier than I recall.</li>
      <li>Some glossy serums leave your hair feeling very oily but this one doesn&#x27;t - I really like it and it works well.</li>
      <li>if it had been my real hair that is.</li>
      <li>really well.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I filled an entire trash can with hair.</li>
      <li>I originally found this product in a local supermarket</li>
      <li>I have had better results from leave in conditioners and other brands of frizz control.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s better to use too little than too much until you find your &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>and it looks brand new!</li>
      <li>You use it to smooth down frizzy hair and make it feel super soft.</li>
      <li>I have a razor cut hairstyle and it keeps my edgy hair cut looking great, especially the ends.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
      <li>This serum has literally been a life saver I spent $50 on a human hair synthetic heat safe wig and wore it every day straight for 3 months.</li>
      <li>I liked the price which is why I switched bands, but I have not liked the results.</li>
      <li>It is inexpensive and provides better results than the Redken equivalent (at less than 1/3 the cost!).</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t live without this stuff</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t want to buy a new wig because of the price.</li>
      <li>I live in Florida and this is the serum I rely on to keep out the humidity.  </li>
      <li>As someone who used other products such as Frizz-ease and was unsatisfied with the results, this stuff is soooo much more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you have shorter hair or it&#x27;s fine, then you can use just a little.  </li>
      <li>The smell is okay but does not tame the fly away hair pieces which I really hoped that it would do since those tiny hairs drive me insane!</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly, and therefore, somewhat frizzy hair.</li>
      <li>I used it to define my naturally curly hair.</li>
      <li>My hair still feels soft to the touch.</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
      <li>You can spend much more for the same exact product and oftentimes, other serums contain alcohol or other drying ingredients.  </li>
      <li>I was buying this in the drugstore near me, but they quit carrying it.....</li>
      <li>I am now addicted to this product I purchased a heat safe synthetic futura wig and have been wearing it for three months straight</li>
      <li>I ended up flat ironing the entire wig and it looked like the day I first bought it!</li>
      <li>If I attempt to apply slightly more (and I mean a tiny pin drop amount) to those areas I end up looking like</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have been a long time user of Frizz-Ease to help smooth my thick, some-what course hair.  From time to time I tried a few other serums but always went back to Frizz-Ease.  Just recently, I heard about got2b&#x27;s version on the Cosmetics Cop radio show - they rated it a best beauty buy for under ten dollars.  So, I decided to try it, mainly because you get so much more product for the money over Frizz-Ease.  And guess what?  I love it better than my old standard!  My hair feels very silky and smooth, and you can&#x27;t beat the price!  Totally recommend this to those that use a silicone serum.</li>
    <li> Great product. I used it to define my naturally curly hair. I just pour a quarter size amount on my hands and work it through my wet hair, style, and let air dry. Couldn&#x27;t live without this stuff and it&#x27;s just a fraction of the price of salon products.</li>
    <li> I use this product daily and love it!  It gives my hair a beautiful shine but doesn&#x27;t leave it gummy or hard to manage.  Keeps the Frizzies down very well.  I apply a small amount in my hands and rub them together then work through wet hair before blow drying.  Protects my hair from the dryer and adds shine.  I ordered 6 bottles in case this product ever gets discontinued I love it that much.</li>
    <li> I really like this serum! It works well, and you don&#x27;t need a lot of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely noticed my hair was smoother after using this! :)</li>
    <li> This is definitely a MUST HAVE product especially if you have curly hair! I have natural wave/semi-curl &amp; depending on humidity can sometimes get a little fuzzy... But not with Got2b Glossy!  I use it alone or with other products such as curling cream, mouse, or even straightening cream depending on my mood for the day. Just a very small amount (approx. dime size) applied to my medium length, not thick hair keeps my hair looking &amp; feeling great and I&#x27;m constantly getting compliments on my hair! You will have to experiment with the amount that will work best for your hair thickness &amp; length, just keep in mind it&#x27;s better to use too little than too much until you find your &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; amount. Be careful not to apply too much and definitely not at the roots &amp; scalp or it will leave your hair feeling limp &amp; oily. One final note, a bottle this size will last me approximately 4-5months and this is with me using it at least 5days a week which makes this product extremely economical. As you can tell, I can&#x27;t sing the praises of this product enough... as said before, it&#x27;s definitely a MUST HAVE!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product it is not super expensive but makes my hair look great and expensive.  A great buy</li>
    <li> This is a great product that I just picked up at the store. I have a razor cut hairstyle and it keeps my edgy hair cut looking great, especially the ends.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get this stuff out of my hair. Even after two rounds of Joy dishwashing liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a haircut, and my hairdresser was horrified at how sticky it was. Mind you that I&#x27;d not used it for a few days and had washed my hair a number of times.</li>
    <li> This is a good product but the bottle is messy.</li>
    <li> I looked up reviews online before buying this product and not one bad word was said. So, I went out and bought the product and tried it and it does not really do anything for my hair. The smell is okay but does not tame the fly away hair pieces which I really hoped that it would do since those tiny hairs drive me insane! Instead, it made the top of my hair look SUPER greasy. Throughout my hair, it was shiny but does not work well towards the roots and it has an insanely greasy feel to it.</li>
    <li> it feels like i&#x27;m dumping molasses and honey on my hair but i guess that is the reason as to why it was so cheap</li>
    <li> This serum has literally been a life saver I spent $50 on a human hair synthetic heat safe wig and wore it every day straight for 3 months. Let me tell you by the end of the third month it was so frizzy, stiff, and dry I couldn&#x27;t get a brush through it. I must say it was more synthetic than human, I learned my lesson there. I didn&#x27;t want to buy a new wig because of the price. It just looked and felt dead from flat ironing and dying... if it had been my real hair that is. I had seen several tutorials on youtube for reviving synthetic wigs. One method was to use oil and another more popular method was to use a flat iron. I decided I needed to take action and test out the heat method I was too afraid to try it before in case the hair would melt. At this time the hair from the wig was falling out and thinning so badly when I brushed it I filled an entire trash can with hair. Then I washed and air dried the wig. I then realized I had the Got2b Glossy Shine Anti-Frizz Serum lying around and decided to give it a try on the wig as a heat protectant serum. I heated up the flat iron and then put a little serum in the palm of my hand and rubbed it all over the hair. I ran the flat iron through and could not believe my eyes. The hair was silky smooth, shiny, and tangle free! I ended up flat ironing the entire wig and it looked like the day I first bought it! I am now addicted to this product I purchased a heat safe synthetic futura wig and have been wearing it for three months straight I rub a little serum on it twice a week and then flat iron if necessary and it looks brand new! Most people throw away these types of wigs after a month because they get so dry tangled and scraggly looking. Now I don&#x27;t have to waste my money buying replacement wig after wig because I can make a cheap heat safe synthetic look like indian remy hair. This method also works great on synthetic, human, and human hair weaves. Ladies just rub a palm size amount of serum into the tracks, run a flat iron through it, and go it will be looking brand new for months to come. Rub a little on your hair every other night and it will stay hydrated for the week with minimal tangling and no need for a flat iron. 5 bucks is cheaper than spending another 50 or 100 or 300 for human hair or human hair blend!hrough it, and go it will be looking brand new for months to come. Rub a little on your hair every other night and it will stay hydrated for the week with minimal tangling and no need for a flat iron. 5 bucks is cheaper than spending another 50 or 100 or 300 for human hair or human hair blend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 60 with course curly hair and this stuff makes it glossy and soft, even when I straighten it with a flat iron. I&#x27;ve gotten  many compliments since I&#x27;ve started using it.</li>
    <li> This is the only hair gel that makes my frizzy hair look OK.  Holds hair together but not too shallac-y.</li>
    <li> came very fast and was exactly what was pictured.  I love this serum and works well with my type of hair</li>
    <li> I have frizz problems because my hair is half wavy, half straight.  I put this on while it&#x27;s still wet and I don&#x27;t get frizz problems.  Just don&#x27;t put it too close to your roots or your hair may feel oily.</li>
    <li> Use to love it but this one clouds over and seems much greasier than I recall. No doubt they&#x27;ll be no more left shortly, but I think this is not real Got2be like so many unsealed beauty products on Amazon.</li>
    <li> As someone who used other products such as Frizz-ease and was unsatisfied with the results, this stuff is soooo much more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of different things play into why you may have frizzy hair, but this stuff works really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And honestly, you can&#x27;t beat this price. You get 2 for less than the price of one in-store! It&#x27;s pretty sweet.</li>
    <li> I was buying this in the drugstore near me, but they quit carrying it.....so I ordered from Amazon...This works great on my wavy/curly hair...I only need like a tiny tiny amount for my ear length wavy hair....it stops the frizz (which many other products I have tried don&#x27;t do it effectively) and does not weigh down my fine curly hair....</li>
    <li> I live in Florida and this is the serum I rely on to keep out the humidity.  I have very long hair and hate to spend time styling it.  If I don&#x27;t use a serum, my wavy hair is frizz city!  I can find this product in my local drugstore or at Walmart and the price is much less than on Amazon.  But if this is the only place you can find it, then go ahead and get it.  It&#x27;s very thick, and since I&#x27;m an ingredient reader, I know that it contains pure silicone, no oil. If you have shorter hair or it&#x27;s fine, then you can use just a little.  The bottle is a generous amount.  However, I use quite a bit and seem to go through a bottle pretty fast so this is economical for me.  You can spend much more for the same exact product and oftentimes, other serums contain alcohol or other drying ingredients.  This works better than the Aveda serum, which I spend more than twice as much for before I discovered this product. I also have used Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Skinny serum and find Got2b much better.  I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Great product. My hair is super curly and usually frizzy. This product tames the curls and gets rid of the frizz. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this serum! You use it to smooth down frizzy hair and make it feel super soft. You seriously only need a tiny amount when you work it into your hair-i&#x27;d say about the size of a pin. Simply squirt a tiny bit onto your fingers, rub your hands together, and work your way down from your roots to your tips. It also helps to thoroughly comb and brush your hair after your done working in the serum with your fingers. I have really frizzy hair, especially in the morning, so I use a little to polish off my look.  It works better after a shower, but&#x27;s it&#x27;s fine to use on unwashed hair-just make sure you don&#x27;t overuse the serum, otherwise it will make your hair look like you dipped your head in product. It easily washes out in your next shower with a bit of conditioner. If I were you, I&#x27;d buy this straight away because it&#x27;s a fantastic deal, and these bottles will last you forever, since you need a miniscule amount of serum to style.</li>
    <li> It works well for me every since I got to the US. Usually I use foam but gel makes it more easy to shape my hair</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in this product. We used as directed on the bottle &amp; found it to be very sticky &amp; hairs stick together like it&#x27;s wet. Not the look I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> Helps to keep my hair from flying away out into outer space.  It is a good price and it works great!</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly, and therefore, somewhat frizzy hair. I have followed the directions on the bottle for use but the frizz by my face isn&#x27;t helped by this product. If I attempt to apply slightly more (and I mean a tiny pin drop amount) to those areas I end up looking like I haven&#x27;t washed my hair in a week. I have had better results from leave in conditioners and other brands of frizz control. I liked the price which is why I switched bands, but I have not liked the results.</li>
    <li> Love this product, it really helps!  I have a lot of frizz in the front of my hair where you really can&#x27;t hide much.  I have bought some $$$ products and this helps just as much as some of the products that cost a small fortune...</li>
    <li> Never tried this one before. I have naturally curly hair and this makes it look less dry and it doesn&#x27;t frizz up as much</li>
    <li> Of course I think she is perfect just the way she is, but she insists on having straightened hair. She used to buy single bottles at the store for much more, but now we buy these.</li>
    <li> also smells great.  And my girlfriend really likes it (the look, smell, and feel).  And I bought it at a great price from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All around just a great product.  Unless you&#x27;re going to spend 4-10x more money-- if you have hair anything like mine, you&#x27;ll love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[ male.  light brownish hair.  mid-20s.  medium-short cut.  I have to use product because otherwise my hair will poof up an inch when it dries b/c it it too fine and too light weight.  ]</li>
    <li> Some glossy serums leave your hair feeling very oily but this one doesn&#x27;t - I really like it and it works well. Really does keep the frizz down and makes hair shiny.</li>
    <li> I bought this to have at work for those reallly hot and humid days to defrizz my hair, however, this is not a good product, it leaves my hair feeling stiff and sticky. I would not recommend this product it was a waste of money and i only use it when im really desperate and then i have to wash my hair that night and get the product out of my hair.</li>
    <li> Found out that citreshine shine is now got2b...I just ran out of citreshine shine and only found it on the Internet...went to a grocery store where I found got2b made by Henkel and Schwarzkopf the same makers of citreshine..I was so happy...plus it was on sale...buy 2 get 1 free...Love this product. I&#x27;ve tried others like the green brand and its just not the sAme.</li>
    <li> Excellent Seller and Product!! Excelente Producto y Vendedor!!!</li>
    <li> ive used paul mitchell&#x27;s super skinny serum for years...but my sister in law gave me one of these to try &amp; i loved it. its the same result as paul&#x27;s, for about 1/5 of the price.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is inexpensive and provides better results than the Redken equivalent (at less than 1/3 the cost!).</li>
    <li> no more bad hair days for curly hair,  Cant find in the store anymore</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product which does a great job at controlling the frizzies even on rainy days and we&#x27;ve had a LOT of them lately in Western Pennsylvania. It does not make hair sticky.  My hair still feels soft to the touch. I originally found this product in a local supermarket but I have been looking for months for it with no luck until I saw it on amazon.com.  AND amazon actually sent me more than I ordered. The item I ordered was for two 4.2 ounce bottles and amazon.com sent me one 4.2 ounce bottle and one 6 ounce bottle - so I got much more than I was expecting.  How nice.  You can always depend on amazon.com to accommodate customers in an expeditious manner.  Instead of delaying my shipment because the 4.2 ounce bottles were out of stock - they sent me the larger size at no extra charge.</li>
    <li> Two words: It. sucks. It just made my hair dry and rock hard. Not only that, my hair was still frizzy afterwards. Do not buy!</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading about it in a magazine.  I like the shine it gives my hair but as an anti-frizz serum it just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
