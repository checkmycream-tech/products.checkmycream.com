<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Perfect for my essential oils! I only gave 4 starts cause mine didn&#x27;t come with the free pump. But It wasn&#x27;t that big of a deal cause I probably wouldn&#x27;t use it anyways</li>
    <li> Love this to use with our essential oils.! Also made a cloth wipe solution can&#x27;t wait to try many more uses</li>
    <li> I love this coconut oil so much!!! I use it to remove tape residue from furniture, soften my hair, as a moisturizer, and as a eye makeup remover. So many uses for this oil!</li>
    <li> Its good and not sticky.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed it was missing the pump</li>
    <li> very nice product. moisturizing  and a big bottle with pump Love it</li>
    <li> Love coconut oil! there are so many great things you can do with it that are beneficial to your health and well being. excited to keep using this product! I like how it feels and that it came with a pump. :)</li>
    <li> Like a lot, specially for cooking and my hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!!!  I use in on my 4C natural hair and my scalp and hair absorb it but are not super oilly afterwards.  For my skin, I mixed it into my lotion and viola, lotion applied in the morning retains moisture through the end of the day.  A little goes a long way so the bottle will last a while.  I will always keep this product on hand.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is the first time I have used coconut oil, so I have just barely tapped its uses, but so far i have used for cooking, lotioning my skin and taming my frizzy curly hair. It it is hard to believe that one product can be so versatile! I like that it comes with an optional pump to use with the oil. I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Ahhh! I just can&#x27;t live without coconut oil! It is truly the best product anyone can have! I use it for cooking, hair mask, face wash, face Moisterizer, body Moisterizer, rash relief for my daughter, cradle cap, and even a conditioner for my maltese! It is a must have for anyone! The benefits are endless! I lobe the fact that it&#x27;s already liquid and comes with a pump making it easy to apply!&lt;br /&gt;* I recieved this product in return for an honest review!</li>
    <li> Premium coconut oil and the bottle/pump combination is a nice touch. We use for many things including lip balm, food additive for cooking, add to our pet food for coat maintenance, beauty, and skin.</li>
    <li> I like it because there is no coconut smell plus it come with pump.</li>
    <li> I love this Coconut oil because it is already liquefied and easy to use! I use it on my stretch marks from having my daughter and I love it!</li>
    <li> Mixes well with essential oil and is quickly absorbed by skin.  No coconut smell</li>
    <li> We use this for massage and are very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I do wish it had scent otherwise it&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> This oil has become one of my go to beauty items. I&#x27;ve used it to moisturize my skin. Not only does it work well, but it smells amazing. It also work great in my hair. The shine that it leaves is gorgeous.</li>
    <li> We love it! The pump makes it easy to use for everything. This is a great feature because we can take it from the bathroom to the kitchen without cross contamination.  We Use it from head to toe, body massages and cooking.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST moisturizer I have ever used!! It is so silky and lightweight and it absorbs quickly! I love regular coconut oil, but it is a little heavy for me as a facial moisturizer. This oil has all the same benefits just without the coconut scent. My skin is soft and glowing and it is actually helping diminish the look of my pores! I highly recommend this product it is amazing and very high quality!</li>
    <li> A little bit goes a long way! Very good coconut oil.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff!! It is odorless which is great for making homemade creams and othe cosmetics. When I first opened it I dabbed a little bit on the one spot on my knuckle where it&#x27;s extremely dry and cracked and within seconds it smoothed it right up. NOTHING I have tried has worked But this. So I am making all different things with this and giving some to my grandmother who can&#x27;t ever get her hands smooth. This truly worked some miracles and I can&#x27;t wait to experiment with different recipes.</li>
    <li> Coconut oil is fantastic...what else can I say? I use it for my curly hair (beats Argan oil, in my opinion), skin, and for application of essential oils. Love that it comes with a pump, too!</li>
    <li> Very happy to find out just how versatile this product is. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Oh wow .. Best oil ever. Light and Beautiful. Fresh and silky !</li>
    <li> Thank you for the fast shipping and a good price for the product my wife like it so much she use it for her hair and she love it a lot. I&#x27;ll definitely buy again soon. Thanks again.</li>
    <li> Fractionated coconut oil is a great product&lt;br /&gt;To have on hand! It&#x27;s so much easier than coconut oil in it&#x27;s solid form when it comes to skin care use! I use this to dilute essential oils to use on myself and my kids. Even use the fractionated coconut oil on my newborns cradle cap!</li>
    <li> So nice. I have in shower and so easy to dispense to use as a moisturizer as I&#x27;m showering. Love it&#x27;!</li>
    <li> Wonderful for your skin!</li>
    <li> easy to use and great product</li>
    <li> So many uses, absolutely love this product! Not too greasy when used for skin. GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> Large bottle of 100% all natural fractionated coconut oil, with shelf life of 5 years.  It will probably be gone in a few months though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Large 14 ounce bottle comes shipped in a sealed bag with the manufactured date on, with the lot number and shelf life being 5 years.&lt;br /&gt;It is odorless and clear.  I have sensitive skin and sensitive to smells so this is excellent for me.  The oil is very light weight and absorbs in leaving your skin smooth no oily or greasy.  I&#x27;m so glad I received this at a promotional rate to review and give my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I used it on my very dry hands and it smooth in all the little white cracks, leaving them feeling smooth.  My husband shaves his head bald and I applied this as an after shave conditioner.  There were no red drag marks or little red bumps at all after massaging this into his scalp immediately after shaving.  After washing my long curly fine hair, I applied some in my palm and pulled down through.  It cut down on most of the frizz and left my fine hair smooth and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend !!</li>
    <li> This oil has saved my life. I&#x27;m loving how it is making my skin feel especially my feet. I take a lot of prescriptions on a daily basis and one of them causes my skin to become dry and rough. Since I&#x27;ve been using this oil my skin is returning back to it&#x27;s natural state. My feet are becoming soft and I&#x27;m desiring to wear them out again thanks to this oil.</li>
    <li> Super product!  Works great!</li>
    <li> Love this oil, High quality natural product with so many uses around your home for this.  Been using to cook with, on our hair and skin.  It provides such super soft skin and smells fantastic. Like that it came with the pump so it convenient and easy to use .</li>
    <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried Fractionated Coconut oil yet then this is a great product to start with.  It has many uses in aromatherapy and is super healthy and good for your skin too.  You can use this oil as it is alone as a massage oil, as a moisturizer or you can blend it with essential oils to create aromatic massage oil blends.  I love experimenting with the essential oil blends and then trying them out on my husband, he works a lot and doesn&#x27;t mind the back and feet rubs.  This oil is really light and a little bit can go a long way unless you&#x27;re skin is really in need of hydration, then you might need a little more.  I usually use about a dime sized amount to get started with a massage and graddually add in a little more as needed.  It absorbs into the skin quickly so you don&#x27;t have to worry about staining your clothing or sheets plus it leaves your skin feeling silky smooth.  This oil is odorless and colorless so it makes the perfect carrier oil for your aromatherapy collection.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> this is such a great oil I love it works so well with my essential oils, this was a highly discounted product that I was able to get in return I am leaving my honest opinion, I cant say anything but good because coconut is the best there is out there to use</li>
    <li> I really like the coconut oil. I rubbed it on my hands and feet with lotion. It was the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I love this!  I use this for cooking and also to mix with essential oils.</li>
    <li> I love the colorless,odorless texture. I will order it again.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product! Great multipurpose product. Softens skin, great for use in cooking, added to essential oils in diffuser. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> My pump never worked from the get go, and it leaked all through the box it arrived in (on other items too) but the bad out of the way, and 3/4 of the bottle left, I do like the coconut oil. I use on on my skin mostly, and I like that the scent isnt too overpowering.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing to use for anything, your hair, skin, makeup removal. Name it and I am sure you can use it for that.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this Fractionated Coconut  Oil. This was the first time I have ever tried this brand and I must say I do like it a lot. After doing some research I found it can be used for a lot of things. I have recently gotten into using essential oils and this oil is perfect for being used as a carrier oil. I just mixed it with what ever essential oil I am using and rub into my body. I also used alone to apply to my dry hard cracked feet. I just used a little on my hands rubbed it into my feet and apply socks then went to bed. The next morning removed socks and my feet were smoother after a few days of doing this there were big changes the dry crack and hardness went away. I also used it on my daughters frizzy dry hair. I applied a small amount and let it set in. Then shampoo and rinse and her hair was softer and not dry. This oil will be a big help around our house.&lt;br /&gt;I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for a review. Regardless all options are 100% my own based on experiences with said product</li>
    <li> This oil helped me convince my husband of it&#x27;s wonderful moisturizing power!  I used to use the pasty white oil I would buy in my grocery store to moisturize, but this is sooooo much better!  I even have my husband using it to moisturize his head after he shaves, his elbows and his feet and he loves how well his skin absorbs it and his feet feel great now.</li>
    <li> I use the oil right after I get out of the shower and now my skin is more soft than ever before. There is little to no scent detectable which makes it a great choice as a carrier oil if you like to make your own aromatherapy mixes. I plan to buy this again and will be sure to tell my friends about this.</li>
    <li> great addition to my beauty regimen</li>
    <li> Been using this as a carrier oil for my essential oils.  Works very well.</li>
    <li> This coconut oil works with my husband when im giving him a back rub, he doesn&#x27;t complain of stickiness or greasy feeling after, even if you just wipe it, it doesn&#x27;t leave the skin clogged that  make you feel warm and sweaty. I also use it in my hair for like a &amp;#34;hot oil style&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I love coconut oil for all my essential oil projects and back massages. I like this brand  because of the  pump. It does not make a mess like other brands!!</li>
    <li> This fractionated coconut oil is very light and really doesn&#x27;t smell like coconut.  We have been using it with essential oils and it soaks into your skin nicely.  Would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Great size.  Great price.</li>
    <li> Not bad, it moisterised my hair very well.My hair is, extremely dry and natural and its, hard to find products for my hair, except for this one It also worked well with my dry skin.I love that I got it at a good price for my unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s not to love about coconut oil?!?! I used this product as a carrier oil to dilute my essential oils! I&#x27;m a natural diva and this product worked great for making my concoctions for my hair! It really helped keep my hair moisturized! My hair loves coconut oil and I love this product! Hair divas, I highly recommend this product! I received this product as promotion to test and review. This is my opinion and experience with this product. I have tried many brands and this one is a keeper!</li>
    <li> Best and most reasonable. Absorbs quickly. Great as a carrier oil</li>
    <li> I was nervous to buy fractionated coconut oil but its actually a good product! I use it for cooking, instead of using grease on my pan I use coconut oil and my food is delicious. Thank you!!</li>
    <li> Love love love this, I use it to dry off with after my shower. It does not leave me feeling all greasy</li>
    <li> love it! just might replace the almond oil in the shower.</li>
    <li> Great product I used it on my hair left it on for about 20 min the washed it out (u have to wash very well) it left my hair conditioned and shiny</li>
    <li> Coconut oil is fabulous</li>
    <li> Love this product! My husband has a bad back, so I routinely give him massages. I always hated the residue that lotions left behind until I found this oil! This is all I use on him anymore - not to mention I use it as a moisturizer for myself! I&#x27;ll always keep this one handy!</li>
    <li> An amazing experience. Now, I have been using the  organic virgin coconut oil in a glass you can find in grocery aisle by olive oil and that has been my usual staple for the longest.  However the hassle of getting it from solid to liquid was a sticking point with me, until now. This has been such a difference in the hair and skincare homemade products I utilized for my myself and my child. The difference in how much better and longer it moisturizes skin is unreal and the difference in your hair when using it as a leave in after a shower, your hair keeps the moisture from it alone for longer then some store products. I will definitely make this a constant staple and plan to test it next with my upcoming batch of homemade deodorant. This product was received at a discounted price in exchange for my unbiased and honest  review.</li>
    <li> I recently bought some lavender essential oil. I added a few drops into this coconut oil and it made the most amazing massage oil. I am going to try this as a shaving cream next.</li>
    <li> This product is great! It goes on smoothly and absorbs into my skin super quick!  So happy!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! My 5 year old son has severe eczema and I have started using this on his skin. It absorbs quickly into his skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling behind. His skin is so much softer and smoother and I haven&#x27;t seen anymore flareups. He doesn&#x27;t even complain when I use this as opposed to all the other products I have tried. This is by far the best!</li>
    <li> I received my Coconut Oil and decided I would try it on my hair and I loved it! I put it in my hair after I took a shower, not a lot because it would make it greasy. But I put a dime size in toweled dried hair and then blew it dry. I was amazed at how soft my hair was after it just felt good, so I thought I would put some on my legs and it made them very smooth without that greasy feeling, I&#x27;ll be using this more after every shower</li>
    <li> A wonderful moisturizer, this coconut oil really helped to repair the dry cracked skin on my hands and my face. It also works wonders mixed with essential oils such as lavender and camphor to soothe tired muscles and joints! A great product all around. I got it in a promotion, but even full priced, its well worth it!</li>
    <li> I started mixing a drop of this coconut oil into my foundation in the morning because my skin has been SO dry. Wayne Goss, a famous make up artist, said this works well, and he&#x27;s totally right. I&#x27;ve also used it in cookies (mmmm), but I must say that the skin benefits are my favorite perk  of using this! I was sent a sample for review as part of a promotion, and I really love it!</li>
    <li> I love that this fractionated coconut oil smells nothing like coconuts! My husband is very happy about this as well! I have been in need of a carrier oil for my peppermint essential oil. I use a carrier oil to make my other essential oils go farther. This oil mixed very well with my peppermint and I was able to put the mixture in a spray bottle and spray down all my window seals and door frames to keep spiders and other creepy crawlies from entering my house! I love that this oil is non-greasy so I don not have to worry about it making anything that I spray it on feel gross. If I get some on my hands, it is no big deal to rub it in - but a little bit sure goes a long way! I sure love this way of keeping bugs out than the chemical method! I was given the chance to test and give my honest opinion on this product during a promotion.</li>
    <li> Amazing oil!! So in love would recommend</li>
    <li> LOVE this oil! So many uses too! I&#x27;ve used it with my essential oils and for dry skin so far. Great size too, which makes it a great value!</li>
    <li> Excellent fractionated coconut oil. Works well as a moisturizer, body massage oil, etc. Odorless, doesn&#x27;t stain, and lasts for years.</li>
    <li> I purchased this oil for my dog since he started to loose some of his back fur. well the fur is going back since I do not believe of spending so much money at the vet to give him chemical medical that would not even work. this oil worked so well that the hair started to spout on him within a week of applying it to the affected area daily. I also take the unrefined organic coconut oil and I love it as it is good for your body and smell good.</li>
    <li> Purchased by the wife:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worked great when making my essential oil blends. It&#x27;s a great massage oil too!</li>
    <li> My hair smelled rancid the next morning after putting it on the night before .</li>
    <li> Great Product! I noticed lots of direct sales places selling it for much more.</li>
    <li> This is some of the best aromatherapy have ever tried. I would recommend anyone buy this and hope that you enjoy it as much as I have.</li>
    <li> I love to use natural products. This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased coconut oil besides cooking type. I&#x27;m just curious how it can improve our outer beauty. I&#x27;m going to use it right after the shower, see if it can apply to skin easily without leaving greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> I love this coconut  oil. You can use coconut oil to moisturize your skin, remove the make-up, it&#x27;s  also a remedy for  small cuts..It&#x27;s a must-have in my house. highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Coconut Oil is just one of those products that you want to always have at the house. There are so many different uses for this oil.The benefits of using Best Fractionated Coconut Oil is tremendous.I don&#x27;t know why but I have frizzy hair at times now. I never used to but this coconut oil helps with that. Apply a little little around the bottom of your hair and frizz begone. I also like to add a little bit in my bath water to help with the moisturizing of my skin.I was so happy to review this product during promotion for my unbiased opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did you know that you can use this for a lip balm also? Yes,you can.Don&#x27;t worry the coconut oil doesn&#x27;t smell.&lt;br /&gt;Put a couple of drops into your conditioner for a little shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this coconut oil and I know that you will also!</li>
    <li> I really do like the products but the shipping is why I rated this three stars.  The box was covered in oil.  It appears that about 1/6 of the oil was lost in the box.  Other than that, it&#x27;s a great product all around.</li>
    <li> I have never used coconut oil so I didn&#x27;t know what to expect. Did it smell like other products that have been &amp;#34;scented&amp;#34; with coconut? No, and I&#x27;m so glad. It has almost no scent if any at all. I really don&#x27;t care to walk around smelling like a coconut factory. :-) The next thing I wanted to find out was if it worked on my very, very dry skin.... I have been putting it on only one arm since I got it and guess what?!? It works. My left arm no longer looks dry &amp; flaky... my right arm is begging to have me put some on in it. Although I did receive a reduced price or free, I always test the products before writing a review and this is my honest opinion. I&#x27;ll continue to explore other ways I can use this. I can&#x27;t wait to find out.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love using this oil as a carrier oil for my essential oils. I love that it doesn&#x27;t have to be heated first to use as a carrier oil, so that way it doesn&#x27;t ruin any of my essential oil quality.  It has a nice smooth smell but it doesn&#x27;t over power anything at all. The oil is great quality and is very moisturizing. When I run out I will definitely be purchasing more of this oil.</li>
    <li> Picked this up as part of a special deal, but was surprised at the quality and versatility of the oil. From the smell of the sweet fresh coconut to all the ways I use it in my daily life: mixed with other essential oils as a muscle and joint rub or even simply as a good all around moisturizer, this coconut oil is a workhorse.</li>
    <li> This coconut oil is great. We use it for oil pulling to improve dental health. We also use it as a skin moisturizer. I like this coconut oil alone and I like mixing it in oil blends. It is a oil for massage. I used it in a recipe for homemade deodorant with shea butter and essential oils which works well. I also made my own lip balm with it. It has so many different uses so I make sure to always have a bottle handy.</li>
    <li> The BEST Fractionated Coconut oil worked wonders on my dry skin, it moisturized it like no other, it didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy like others have.  My twin daughters hair was feeling a little dry, i put a little of the coconut oil in my hands and rubbed it all through their hair and scalp, i then braided their hair as i usually do and left the oil in it.  once i took the coconut oil off, their hair felt amazing.  I was very happy with the results and plan to continue using this coconut oil.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it 3 nights in a row on my hair and it doesn&#x27;t feel dry anymore. I barely have frizz and my curls look nice now.</li>
    <li> Like this oil. Smooths skin.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love coconut oil. There are so many uses for this stuff, its unbelievable. This makes my skin feel so soft and it absorbs well into the skin. I have used coconut oil for many years now and I always find some use for it. Its great!! Good brand too.</li>
    <li> Great oil, lovely coconat smell!</li>
    <li> It works great and smells amazing!</li>
    <li> Coconut oil is the beast natural beauty product. Fractionated coconut oil is perfect in removing make-up, keeping the skin soft and subtle, and never dry. I dab a few drops on a cotton ball and easily takes off my eye make-up, especially water proof mascara. I also use it as after shower alternative to lotion. It keeps my skin hydrated and moist, but never too oily. Another suggestion is using it on your feet to keep your feet looking like you just got a fresh pedicure. It helps treat rough, scaly heels and oils your cuticle. It&#x27;s great for hair care to help eliminate frizz, split ends and dry scalp. This is a good size bottle and will last through a lot of different uses. I purchased this at promotional price because I knew I was going to use it for so many different things. I&#x27;m glad to be able to share my experience through reviews. This product is definitely a must-have.</li>
