    <li> Fantastic product. Fast shipment!</li>
    <li> This smells sooo good and and leave my hair With a beautiful shine unlike other&#x27;s I&#x27;m a black woman that is using this product  and I would highly recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> This is great when you get your hair roller set. It leaves your hair with really good body and great bounce if you curl it. I would recommend this</li>
    <li> I was looking for a product to use after doing my deep conditioning to moisturize my hair (since my hair is excessively dry)and I guess I made the right choice in giving this product a try.  So far it&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s job and find that&#x27;s it better to moisturize frequently instead of waiting for the hair to get completely dry.  What works for me may not work for you but until you have actually tried a product and used it accordingly you will never know what you can rely on and benefit from.  What  I recommend these company to do is have a sample size so consumers can try out before investing in a large size product.  Imagine if it did not worked out this whole bottle could have gone waisted and money down the drain...so always do a little research especially when buying on line....usually with Dominican products you cannot go wrong because they know &amp;#34;HAIR&amp;#34; ...so enjoy!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! It helps keep my hair well moisturized without weighing it down or leaving it feelings greasy. And the smell is fabulous. I recommend this product to everyone that has dry or coarse hair.</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN SEARCHING FOR THE BEST LEAVE-IN ON THE MARKET FOR YEARS. I FOUND IT. DOMINICAN MAGIC LEAVE-IN CONDITIONER IS THE BEST. I NEEDED A LEAVE-IN THAT MAKES MY HAIR SOFT AND MOISTURIZED AFTER BLOW DRYING. I PLACE THE LEAVE-IN AFTER I RINSE OUT THE CONDITIONER. I BLOW DRY AND I CAN FEEL THE DIFFERENCE IN MY HAIR IMMED. NO BREAKAGE, SOFT,SILKY,STRONG AND MANAGEABLE HAIR. THIS STUFF IS GREAT.</li>
    <li> This did not detangle my hair or provide moisture...will not repurchase.  If you didn&#x27;t like this product try lacio lacio leave-in, which is the real dominican magic in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I have a dry long curly hair and this product makes my hair soft and moisturizes and smells great. I hope to see huge difference in months to come since I only been using it for two weeks but so far so good</li>
    <li> My hairdresser don&#x27;t like this product for for my hair, it gives it a flakey look.  Used other Dominican Magic Products, so far OK.</li>
    <li> Works great on my hair . No flakes or dryness ever! Awesome product that I would recommend to anyone looking for a great product</li>
    <li> Love the smell and the texture of this product. no build up, and it smells fantastic. I use it with the Jamaican coconut oil. and my hair is like happiest ever.</li>
    <li> Amazing. I don&#x27;t really like to write reviews but I tried this and I&#x27;m in love.  I have mixed naturally curly long hair and this makes my curls look great. I&#x27;m thinking of trying some other Dominican magic products.  You won&#x27;t regret.</li>
    <li> its ok, nothing out of the ordinary</li>
    <li> I am Dominican, and I tend to switch between Dominican products and products intended specifically for naturally kinky hair. This one treated my natural hair (4a,b,c) very nicely, smells amazing, and lasted me a really long time. I didn&#x27;t purchase again because I wanted to try something else but maybe in the future!</li>
    <li> This is a good leave in conditioner. It really softens the hair. After washing and conditioning the hair, add some of the product to your wet hair. It will make your roller set very soft. I&#x27;ve never blow dried after applying, but I&#x27;d imagine it would have the same effect. My hair currently has two textures, half relaxed straight, and half naturally coarse. When I do certain styles, and I want to revive the natural part of my hair that is coarse, I apply Dominican Magic to that area. It softens my coarse natural hair tremendously. Although, it does cause a bit of shrinkage.</li>
    <li> My daughter love this leave-in because it makes their hair soft.</li>
    <li> We tested this one among others for our daughter. She has super curly and rather dry hair. This came out as the winner. It provides sufficient moisture without weighing her her down as others. Also has a great smell.</li>
    <li> IT MADE MY HAIR SILKY SMOOTH BUT I DON&#x27;T THINK ITS WORTH THE PRICE. THERE ARE OTHER PRODUCTS THAT WORK JUST AS WELL FOR MY HAIR.</li>
    <li> Prefer the Silicon or crese Cabello. DOMINICAN MAGIC is good but a bit greasy.</li>
    <li> Dominican produfcts for all types of hairs are the BEST in the market!&lt;br /&gt;Try it and see the difference on you hair since the first use.</li>
    <li> This product conditioner works well with my hair after shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;It locks on the moisture in my hair and  make it easy to style.&lt;br /&gt;I use this product often if needed.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend Dominican Magic Nourising Moisture  Lock Leave on Conditioner.</li>
    <li> This leave in conditioner works great with the Dominican Magic Shampoo. Soft and bouncy was what I got and love it!</li>
    <li> I love Dominican Magic hair products! They leave your hair soft and manageable. I have the leave in conditioner and it makes my hair soft. Also smells good! Use the whole line to achieve maximum results! You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use it in my hair before I do a roller set. It leaves my hair feeling nice and soft. What&lt;br /&gt; I liked the most is that it really helps with my dry hair. The whole Dominican Magic hair line is worth investing in. Give it a try</li>
    <li> I use as a leave in on dry hair days after my flat ironed hair is no longer good to wear down. I simply apply this leave in and shae butter oil to pull my hair into a ponytail and my hair stays soft and shiney until wash day...</li>
    <li> Great shampoo. Smells great and cleans hair very well. Adds shine and detangles. My hair dresser recommended this fabulous product because I cant get perms anymore.  Love it.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it states!!!! i will not use any other product as this moisturizes my hair excellently.</li>
