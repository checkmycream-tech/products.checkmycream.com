      <li>A really worthwhile mask to have, shrinks pores, evens tone and not overly drying.</li>

      <li>One Minute Mask was just OK.</li>

      <li>sure about effectiveness yet.  </li>

      <li>Kind of like a mini spa treatment right in the privacy of your own bathroom.  </li>
      <li>So this is an area I&#x27;m very familiar with.</li>
      <li>skin is pretty prone to breakouts, so the fact that this didn&#x27;t make my face break out more is a good thing.</li>
      <li>One Minute mask isn&#x27;t uncomfortable--actually, the warmth feels nice, and it&#x27;s smooth and easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and feels good, and if products like these work for you then it might be worth a try.  </li>
      <li>I have pretty good skin.</li>
      <li>It is a strong cleanser and probably shouldn&#x27;t be used more than a couple of times a week.  </li>
      <li>It is no joke when it says self heating, it gets nice and warm and really draws the dirt out of my pores.</li>
      <li>Although it didn&#x27;t completely clean them they looked a LOT better :)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this stuff! Makes your skin super soft.</li>
    <li> Works great and is very soothing.  A really worthwhile mask to have, shrinks pores, evens tone and not overly drying.</li>
    <li> I used to buy these in the store and they stopped selling them so I went onto amazon and am so excited. They are cheaper here too. Love the mask I use it three times a week at least and it has cleared up my blackheads.</li>
    <li> Great for once a week facial!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference in my skin, but these feel great. They truly do heat up quickly in your hand and give you a nice fresh, clean feeling. I use it once a week.</li>
    <li> This mask is great for someone who wants to do a mask but has limited time. Bought some for myself and loved it so much I gave some to my sister who has a new baby and no time for herself ;)</li>
    <li> Definitely cleans up my face. I love using this after the gym!</li>
    <li> Feels good, but I don&#x27;t really notice a different. The fact it only comes with 4 packages for the price (it&#x27;s basically activated charcoal and soap in a pack), for the price (5.00 at this time) is a little much.</li>
    <li> I REALLY LIKED IT. Wondered how instantly get warm feel from the mask.</li>
    <li> After just one use this product, my face broke out in little white bumps, it dried out my skin, and it burnt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware of using this product, there are a lot of really harsh chemicals in it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my teenage daughter, she likes it says it works well.</li>
    <li> I love the heat this mask produces. It really does minimize my pores and leaves my skin feeling smooth and clean.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for my pores. Going back to clay based masks.</li>
    <li> They are definitely self heating but I didn&#x27;t see where it helped anywhere else.</li>
    <li> it is alright, want the best products from biore.</li>
    <li> I love the mask but for the money I didn&#x27;t get enough masks.</li>
    <li> I generally prefer the old &amp;#34;leave on and rinse after drying or remove type masks, but the self heating with cooling sensation made the mask feel refreshing and nice despite having to rub it to activate it&#x27;s effects. Interesting, and effective product to try.</li>
    <li> Really warms up fast!</li>
    <li> It do get warm on your skin but it cleans n refresh.</li>
    <li> I REALLY FEEL THE IMPURITIES GO AWAY FRO MY FACE WITH THIS.</li>
    <li> Do you hate black heads, and annoying milieus? Here is the solution. No need for expensive dermatology appointments. Charcoal extraction is safe, pain free, non-toxic, and kind to the most sensitive skin. Apply prior to taking a bath. Relax and let the product loosen up those highly annoying milieus, white heads, and black heads.  Remove with a gentle cloth and be amazed as that ugly white or black plug just rubs off. Safe to use all over the body and no soap scum residue. My skin glows. My own Mom asked if I had work done. Yeah, bye bye milieus ... He&#x27;ll-o clear, clean, fresh skin.</li>
    <li> The Biore self heating mask was quick and easy-to-use - simply open, rub all over wet face using round, upward circle motion, wait one minute, then wash off. The mask is self-heating, and warms as you rub it in: like that.  I noticed a difference when I washed the mask off, with my face smoother and clearer than previously. This mask did leave a small tingling sensation behind for the next minute or two just after washing off, unlike past self-heating masks I&#x27;ve used: but I tend to have sensitive skin, so it could be due to that. It was short-lived and not unpleasant: mask was really great, would be useful for a little, quick self-done, occasional mask: would recommend!</li>
    <li> I thought I was going to be giving negative feedback because there was so little product in the pouch.  Nope!  That little bit did an awesome job of opening the pores on my nose and left my face feeling smooth and very, very clean.  Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s weird and barely works. Their old mask worked better I think.</li>
    <li> It feel so good going on, I was pleasantly surprised by the heat... it felt so good!! I&#x27;ve used it twice in the past week. It makes me face SO SMOOTH afterwards. I haven&#x27;t had any redness at all... I will continue to buy this product</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Love how it self heats. I only wish I could have bought a bottle instead of the 4 pack of individual use tubes.</li>
    <li> I have pretty good skin. A little oily in some places, a bit prone to blackheads in others, but generally good. I wasn&#x27;t looking for this mask to perform miracles, but it would be nice if it had done, well, anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did mine in the shower, and with wet skin and the humidity, it went on pretty easily and washed off pretty easily. In between, it got warm, then cooled off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, i can&#x27;t see or feel any difference in my skin. Maybe it&#x27;ll make a difference for women who wear make-up, or have more trouble with blemishes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used this product before. The more I was impressed after using it. I loved the self heating effect and the feeling it left on my skin after it. Excellent result. Thanks.</li>
    <li> It is useful as it described.</li>
    <li> I found this product to be quite effective. It is a bit drying, and be careful about getting it in your hair. Use before showering or be careful not to get it in your hair; it makes it feel like straw. It is effective in its purpose, however, and easy to use. My real caveat is the price. Even at Amazon, it&#x27;s about $6.50 a box. Using as directed--2-3 times/week--means at least $6.50 every two weeks. Very pricey in my book.</li>
    <li> It might be my skin but it made me break out really bad and my face was super red after I used it. My boyfriend used it and like it but I have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been into facials in years, so got this on a whim. Am I glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s almost unbelievable how easy this is. Just squeeze the contents from package to left hand, then transfer some to right hand and blend onto your skin with both hands...like a mask, avoiding the eyes, of course. Wait a minute and then rinse it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will be surprised how warm it is--just the right temp--and how marvelous it feels on your skin. But the big surprise for me was when I cleansed it off, my skin felt so tingly, alive and CLEAN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, it didn&#x27;t remove any wrinkles or anything like that, but it seemed to purify the tiny blackheads. I worked 85 years for these wrinkles and they won&#x27;t go willingly. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love, love, love this product and will get it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review by Betty Dravis, March 19, 2014&lt;br /&gt;Author of &amp;#34;1106 Grand Boulevard&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> $4.50 for a mask is way too much money in my opinion. I mean, if it really did something magical for my face, maybe...but Biore Self Heating One Minute Mask was just OK. You wet your face and dry your hands. Open the single use packet--oh yeah, the complete wastefulness of putting this product into a one-use container! UGH! Gimmicky and wasteful! Anyway, you spread the stuff on your face and it is nice and wrm for a couple seconds. Then rub 1 minute and rinse. Not impressed. I use clay masks all the time and nothing stood out about this wasteful and expensive product. Pass.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see much in the way of results with it.</li>
    <li> I use this in the shower. It creates a lovely tingly heat followed by a menthol-like cool feeling after rinsing. There is a generous amount in each packet- enough left to use on my neck and chest.  It makes my skin very soft and hydrated. I love it! I&#x27;m going to get more as a small gift for friends.</li>
    <li> I ordered 3 of Biore self heating one minute mask, but i only received 2 of them. Did you check the items quantity before shipping?</li>
    <li> When I first applied the mask, i was simply amazed with how hot it was. I mean it really felt hot to the touch. it did not burn in anyway, but a hot mask and a warm mask are so incredibly different. I loved the way this made my skin feel. It was easy to apply, but a couple of down sides to this package. One is the single use packaging is a lot to throw away. I am not a huge fan of a lot of packaging for little product. The other is despite what the picture shows, a single package was not nearly enough to apply the product as thickly as it shows. in fact, it was quite thin and barely enough to cover my entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a pretty big fan of Biore products, and this did not let me down.</li>
    <li> I liked this well enough, but I don’t know that I’d buy it. On the bright side, it really does heat up and there is more than enough in the packet to cover your whole face and really work it in, which I like. I’ve used other self-heating masks/cleansers that I’ve been less than impressed with because they seem to peter out after a few seconds and are lukewarm at best. The reason that I wouldn’t buy it again is that I didn’t really see any results. My face wasn’t particularly soft or luminous or any of the things that prompt me to go head over heels for a face product.</li>
    <li> This has to be the best face mask I have ever used!&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely loved this. It already comes pre measured in individual packets, so the amount you use is just right, you wont have to worry about using too much or too little. The mask is a charcoal light grey and has a wonderful fruit scent. The mask does get warm once applied to your face, but the heat is only activated by water so make sure your face is a little damp before applying. You massage into your skin for about a minute then wash off. Great product, I was pleased and my skin felt very clean and refreshed.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product for use by teen girls or boys who are dealing with acne brought on by puberty. They&#x27;ll appreciate the spa-like treatment and the fresh-faced results. You&#x27;ll appreciate the affordable price. Two boxes (8 packettes) will last one month for twice-weekly masks at less than the cost of a large acne-causing pizza.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the drying properties of the ingredients may not be ideal for older skin, the affordable price, ease of use, convenient packettes and glowing results makes this a perfect health and beauty product for your young teen. Plus, it&#x27;s a fresh, fun way to introduce the habits of lifelong skin care to an impressionable group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked how simply this product delivered on its promise of keeping \\&quot;skin clear and healthy with deep-cleansing\\&quot; masks. Highly recommend it for your teens&#x27; healthy skin regime.</li>
    <li> My skin feels so clean after using this. Great value!</li>
    <li> Leave my face feeling smooth and refreshed.</li>
    <li> I chose this for the same reason you all did...instant beauty &amp; flawless skin. When are we EVER going to learn thats NOT going to happen?  How many products must we buy before we finally &amp;#34;get it&amp;#34;?  This product claims to  &amp;#34;purifies pores&amp;#34;, and draws out dirt &amp; oil. It &#x27;heats up&amp;#34; too.  What does that even mean &amp; why don&#x27;t we question these  odd words?  Now, Why does my face look &amp; act no different after using a tube of this, than when I used a bar of soap &amp; some water?  BECAUSE IT DOES NOTHING!  Lets start looking inside ourselves for  beauty and stop filling  the pockets of the suits that push these product on insecure people!</li>
    <li> If rinsing this mask of my pores were SO tight and my face so smooth! I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s actually cleaning out my pores but the end result leaves me feeling fabulous!</li>
    <li> Loved this product! I have oily skin and have recently become very sensitive to acne and pores. After trying multiple products that have done little to no change, I decided to try this mask and enjoyed it. You can feel the heat once you apply it and end up with refreshed, soft skin after washing off. I noticed a difference in my pores and acne within a day. Great product!</li>
    <li> I am a guy and first time user for this product. I thought it was a piece of &#x27;mask&#x27; when checking online but turned out to be in gel form.&lt;br /&gt;Basically you need to apply it to your face and start scrub immediately. It heats up quick and feels weird for first 10 secs. However after washing off the &#x27;dirt&#x27; in a minute it is cooling your face faster than heating it up. Then the comfort lasted for about an hour or so. My face also looked glowing too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if it actually draw all the dirts from pores or applied some magic nutrition to the skin etc.  but I do feel comfortable after using it.</li>
    <li> This was just too much for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> these are cute and fun to use - and only takes one minute - who doesn&#x27;t have time for that!  It is very thick, blackish cream kinda hard to get it all out of the pack but if you fold it in half and really squeeze you can get it all out.  Then you just rub it into your wet face - avoid your eye area!!  It feels warm - not too hot but it feels really neat!  Then you rinse off after a minute of rubbing it in you don&#x27;t let it dry like a normal mask.  I wash first with Biore Charcoal wash.  Then do this mask once a week before doing my Biore nose strip!  After all three, your face has never felt cleaner!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a sucker for a mask that warms up, so this one had me at first application. Combine that with my skin feeling smoother and looking brighter, and I&#x27;m sold!</li>
    <li> Love this product! The self heating can feel weird at first, but my skin feel really amazing afterwards. You get used to the heating part and after washing it off, it has a cooling feeling, which feels amazing. Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of masks and have quite a few, from the cheap ($5) to the more expensive ($60-70). The problem with masks, however, is that I sometimes want to use one in the morning but do not have 10 minutes or so to spare. That said, I was really excited about this one minute mask. After using this product, however, I am no longer excited. On the plus side, this mask really does heat up. On the minus side, this mask left my skin feeling weird...like it went from heating to kind of burning. The marketing on this, however, is genius and a lot of people will think that the heat/tingling feeling is a sign that their face is clean face. It is not. To put it bluntly, my face is equally clean when I use a cheap (think Freeman) mask, probably cleaner. All and all, this face mask is worse than my $5 face mask because it costs more (4 applications for $7) versus (8-10 applications for $5).</li>
    <li> Feels wonderful on the skin and seems to tighten my pores.</li>
    <li> Yes, as it does work! As soon as you put it on all over your face, it starts to work. The only negative thing is the color, it looks like a mixture of mud &amp; clay; but, it works! No fragrance, by the way!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with these. My face has never felt so clean. I have always had a problem with my pores and this works better than any other product I&#x27;ve used (Even the strips!) Although it didn&#x27;t completely clean them they looked a LOT better :)</li>
    <li> Definitely heating!  I&#x27;m a ginger so my skin may be a little more sensitive.  I didn&#x27;t mind the heating but it was noticeable.  So were the results.  I use this in combination with the charcoal cleaner also by Biore.  Nice combo.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from this thing, but was pleasantly surprised when it started warming up after a few minutes! Careful if you have sensitive skin, though - you may want to cut a bit off and try it somewhere that&#x27;s NOT your face first to make sure it doesn&#x27;t make you have a reaction as some other reviewers are reporting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using a couple of these in a week, there was no noticeable change to my skin. After using these, you may have softer skin, but really you can achieve the same thing by slathering on some moisturizer. I think some people may be noticing the slight exfoliating effects of the gritty texture on their skin, which is good for some but may aggravate sensitive skin for others. It&#x27;s not like these things are too expensive, though, so I suppose you could give it a try for less than $8! (Currently there&#x27;s coupon being offered for this item, too, so that helps!)</li>
    <li> Does get hot.  Seems to work.  I use it in the shower so it&#x27;s easier to wash off.</li>
    <li> I give it a four star because it did do what it was supposed to do but it didn&#x27;t clear my skin after a week. It left my skin squeaky clean but it does make a mess. the outcome was not what I expected it to be.</li>
    <li> Not only does this do nothing for your skin, but the &amp;#34;self heating&amp;#34; lasts for only a few seconds. The menthol, however, freeze-burns your face for the next half hour. Horrible product.</li>
    <li> Well, it certainly feels as though it&#x27;s working. Like advertised, this mask totally heats up and definitely feels like something you&#x27;d get done in a spa; not something that came in a box. My face felt super, super soft after I rinsed the mask off, but I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was anything aside from the fact that my skin had just been majorly heated up and exfoliated. The next day, I didn&#x27;t feel a whole lot different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is pretty prone to breakouts, so the fact that this didn&#x27;t make my face break out more is a good thing. I loved the calming spa affect and would definitely use again.</li>
    <li> I used it for 5 or more times already but without any even slightest difference, its just useless ufortunately.</li>
    <li> Great product . Work well.</li>
    <li> This mask is amazing. I love how it heats up by the touch of your fingers and the deeper you massage the product the more heat it generates. I also love the cooling feeling of mints.</li>
    <li> I did some extractions and then used this product and the warming affect and how my skin felt afterwards was wonderful. I wish there were more than 4 applications in a box b/c it states to use 3 or 4 times a week. I won&#x27;t be doing that simply due to what the cost would be (however, I don&#x27;t think the cost is unreasonable), but I will continue to use the product and recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is so cool!! It&#x27;s amazing how it heats up. My face feels so clean. Charcoal has proven to be an amazing cleaner for my skin. I can feel it tingle and get in my skin and remove all the dirt. This is a great product!</li>
    <li> As a Sephora customer, I tend to splurge a little when it comes to my face. I was going to travel for a bit, and needed something travel friendly and easy to transport for my facial needs. I found this, and took a gamble. I&#x27;m glad I did. Not only was this very easy to do (just wet face, and rub this in for a minute, and rinse), but my face felt absolutely wonderful afterwards! The mask feels warm to the touch when you rub it, and it&#x27;s delightful. Then you&#x27;re face feels completely refreshed and unclogged afterwards. I&#x27;ve used this and no breakouts. It&#x27;s easy to apply, so no weird dirty hands trying to awkwardly close up jars, etc. I like that the masks came in individual pre-determined portions. It&#x27;s nice to finally find a beauty product that you don&#x27;t have to pay an arm and a leg for. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I do like these BIORE SELF HEATING ONE MINUTE MASKS. The mask is actually quite soothing and relaxing.  You simply smooth the product on to your skin, massage it in for about one minute, and rinse with warm water.  The mask heats up as soon as you start to rub it in and has cooled down by the time you rinse.  Your skin is left feeling soft, smooth, and clean.  Kind of like a mini spa treatment right in the privacy of your own bathroom.  Neat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend BIORE SELF HEATING ONE MINUTE MASK.  But because of my sensitive, aging skin, I only use them about once a week, and not the 2-3 times a week as the packaging states.  I will leave that to those with younger, stronger skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been enjoying these masks mostly because I really love any product that warms up. These are perfect for me in that regard; they do get nice and toasty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You apply to a damp face and the water is what activates the product. You massage it in for a minute and that seems to make it even warmer. Then you rinse it off right away. It comes off quite easy, no need for rubbing or scrubbing it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the effectiveness, I can&#x27;t say. My skin feels nice afterwards but not sure there is a discernible difference as far as blackheads go. I would get them again however because I really like them as part of a mini facial at home process.</li>
    <li> I really like the Biore Self Heating One Minute Mask.  I have been using it once a week for 4 weeks, and I have noticed slight improvements to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin, and I am often hesitant to try out new products.  Because I use Biore&#x27;s face strips, I thought I would give the mask a try.  As my skin is in very good condition, I was not looking for a miracle product. I wanted something that would simply give me a nice deep clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package directions say that the mask can be used 2-3 times a week, but due to my sensitivity, I opted to use it only once a week.  The mask gives your face a nice tingly feeling when it is applied, and leaves skin looking smooth.  Since using the Biore mask, my pores are unnoticeable, and my face appears brighter, most likely due to no longer having any clogged pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend the product to those who are looking for a miracle product, but it definitely gets the job done for those who are looking for a deep cleanse.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised at all the 3 and 4 star reviews for this mask here. It goes to show how we can all have different reactions from a given product. That&#x27;s a reason why it&#x27;s good to have lots of reviewers review an item, to hear the different points of view.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 45 years old and I haven&#x27;t work makeup for probably twenty years. My skin care is very important to me because people see my actual skin - not a layer of cover-up. I&#x27;ve tried ALL sorts of products over the years. Scrubs, masks, gels, you name it. So this is an area I&#x27;m very familiar with. If you&#x27;ve seen it on store shelves, I&#x27;ve probably tried it at some point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have sensitive skin, so many times the test process involves my face turning bright red and me marking that as &amp;#34;never try again&amp;#34; on the list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I was curious how this would work out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask squeezes out of the container and as you gently swirl it on your skin it self-warms. I like this. I definitely find a warm application of a product helps the pores open up. If the pores stay shut (if you used a very cold product, for example) then it&#x27;d be hard for the gunk to get out of them. So I do like the idea of the warming heat here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask went on easily and it washed off easily. Right away when it came off my face felt cleaner and fresh. The pores felt cleaned. My skin also felt softer. That lasted a day or two. I also didn&#x27;t have any negative reactions (redness etc) which I was pleasantly surprised by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t use this all the time - I tend to try to be gentle on my face. But I would use this every other week to ensure the pores got cleaned out regularly. If someone wore makeup every day I might use the mask more frequently, to get off all those chemicals which are being pressed into the pores every day.</li>
    <li> I have dry, sensitive, acne prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my biggest issues with masks is that due to my sensitive skin, they burn.  This one did not.  Wash your face, leaving a little bit of water.  Apply the mask, and it will heat up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the mask to be easy to apply and easy to wash off.  My skin felt clean and healthy.  I would recommend using this mask once a week.</li>
    <li> Pros: The mask has a nice heat and feel as the mask cleans. My favorite thing about it is the refreshing clean feeling my face has after use. I definitely feel like the mask cleans my face well and wakes up my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I&#x27;m not sure it cleans my pores that well. Its hard to rate these types of masks though because I use them in conjunction with other pore cleaning products. I think the product cleans my face very well but I don&#x27;t know if it penetrates that deeply into my pores.</li>
    <li> It does heat up and after first washing my skin did feel clean but it made me break out after the second use, however, my skin is sensitive so it should be fine for anyone else. I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily buy it again but I did recommend to a friend who loves it</li>
    <li> I give this mask a solid four stars because it really heats up as you apply it, and I thought that was very innovative and cool. The only reason I remove a star is because I didn&#x27;t notice a noticeable difference. It was, however, a pleasure to use. It doesn&#x27;t harden or stick to the skin, so after the initial application, it&#x27;s very easy to rinse off.</li>
    <li> This felt like a cheaper (self-heating!) alternative to the Origins Charcoal mask.  I liked this one.  It felt good on the skin and was non-drying (less drying than the Origins mask).  It made my complexion look brighter and, importantly, it didn&#x27;t break me out.  All in all, this is something I would purchase.</li>
    <li> This is advertised as a &amp;#34;heating mask&amp;#34; and I have to say that it does heat up noticable and feels very good against the skin. The product is a dark gray in color (from the activated charcoal) and very gritty in texture. The mask comes in flat plastic &amp;#34;tubes&amp;#34; that you open by ripping off  the end. The second you remove it from the plastic, the substance starts to warm, and then feels quite hot against the face. I liked the feel, if nothing else. Does it work? Your guess is as good as mine. My skin seemed brighter after use, which could very well be a result of the warming of the product, and the mild exfoliating nature of the abrasive carbon. I&#x27;m highly suspicious of anything that claims to &amp;#34;remove deep impurities&amp;#34;, but the mask did feel good against the skin, and seemed to have a gentle exfoliating effect that made my skin seem clearer and brighter. So, bottom line? Interesting, feels good against the skin, and works well as an exfoliant, but I&#x27;m not convinced this works any better than regular soap and water</li>
    <li> I am a 49 year old female who still suffers from occasional breakouts and clogged pores.  I do like the Biore line of products so was excited to try this one minute mask to clear up my pores.  This mask works well enough.  It was interesting the first time I tried it and it really did heat up as soon as I got it on my hands.  Very interesting.  It provides a good clean to my face but did not get the pores 100% clear.  I just dont think anything over the counter can get my pores as clear as I&#x27;d like.  Still, I like how it cleans and will probably buy it again.</li>
    <li> I generally don&#x27;t bother much with masks.  They&#x27;re usually pretty inconvenient or uncomfortable, which would be fine if I saw visible improvement after a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biore&#x27;s Self Heating One Minute mask isn&#x27;t uncomfortable--actually, the warmth feels nice, and it&#x27;s smooth and easy to apply.  And it isn&#x27;t inconvenient, since it goes on easily and washes off quickly.  I actually got my hopes up.  But after using four in about two weeks, I&#x27;ve seen no change in my skin at all.  I&#x27;ve got the same oily patches an hour or two after using the mask, and the same stress breakouts... well, continuously.  It could be that NO product will ever be stronger than my skin and my stress, which seem to be an unbeatable combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s just me, and anyone with better skin than me may benefit from this mask.  It&#x27;s easy to use and feels good, and if products like these work for you then it might be worth a try.  I wish it worked for me.</li>
    <li> Great product however I will head to the drug store in future to save time and $</li>
    <li> Feels great and works work to exfoliate gently and clean pores. Used two or three times a week, I definitely have fewer blackheads.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It goes on very warm (almost hot) when you apply it with wet finger tips. After about ten seconds the warming fades. I rubbed it in the entire minute, and then rinsed. My face felt cleaner, and my pores (especially in my T-zone) were a bit smaller since the dirt had dissolved. I am happy with my order.</li>
    <li> Great face mask, and it only takes one minute to work.  I used to use a 30 minute mud mask, this product works even better to clean out blackheads that you didn&#x27;t even know you had in only one minute.  It&#x27;s a great time saver, and who wants to hide in their bathroom looking like the Incredible Hulk for half an hour anyway.</li>
    <li> Just got it yesterday and used it right away, it smells minty as you put it on which was a pleasant surprise and once washed off I noticed the very nice scent left behind. I love it!</li>
    <li> I have used this mask two times now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;*substantial amount of product to cover entire face&lt;br /&gt;*ease of use&lt;br /&gt;*long lasting &amp;#34;cooling&amp;#34; effect post rinse&lt;br /&gt;*rinses easily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;*&amp;#34;heat&amp;#34; lasts only seconds and not over entire face.  I tend to start on my cheeks and the first cheek is the only area to feel the &amp;#34;heat&amp;#34; for seconds&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure about effectiveness yet.  Will need to try at least for a month on a regular basis but the package only has four masks.  The directions read, &amp;#34;may use up to 2/3 times /week.&amp;#34;  I&#x27;d have to purchase three to four boxes per month.  That&#x27;s a lot of money!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used two of these so far and I&#x27;m pretty impressed with the results. I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts recently and I&#x27;m prone to them even though I&#x27;m nearly 30 due to how oily my skin can get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found the masks do a pretty good job leaving my face in a clean enough state where I feel good. I&#x27;ll probably stick to the pads though to remove dirt due to how expensive this is for the number of masks you get. I guess it&#x27;s a good product if you&#x27;re going to do the masks not very often and for a thorough cleaning but if you are going to need to clean your face more often those other products are definitely more ideal.</li>
    <li> Used this mask and I had to wash it off right away - it made my skin sting.  I have really extra sensitive skin, so you might experience better results.  But if lots of products bother your skin, I&#x27;d skin this one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m kind of a product junkie, and face masks top the list of things I love most to try. I love Biore pore strips, so I was looking forward to trying this product, but ultimately it&#x27;s nothing special and doesn&#x27;t do anything amazing. The masks are packed individually and are a little hard to squeeze out of the packet one-handed. It does heat up immediately with water, and the warming effect is pleasing and feels great, as does the subsequent cooling that comes a few seconds later. The mask doesn&#x27;t dry, and is washed off pretty quickly, so I don&#x27;t think that it actually does anything. I don&#x27;t find my pores any clearer, or my skin any softer - the only benefit is that it feels good while using. Additionally the masks are pretty expensive, at almost $2 per pack, and the price doesn&#x27;t correlate with the product at all.</li>
    <li> i did not like this product. it honestly didn&#x27;t make anything smoother, or better, or brighter...what it did was smell weird. i can&#x27;t quite name the smell but i didn&#x27;t like it. i am pretty particular about what i put on my face and usually enjoy biore products but not this one</li>
    <li> Biore products are the only skin line system that have ever worked for me, so I was eager to try out this mask. It is no joke when it says self heating, it gets nice and warm and really draws the dirt out of my pores. Also like most Biore products, my face felt cold and tingly after I washed it off. I had no problem with it being overly sticky or goopy, maybe the people who did didn&#x27;t listen to the directions and wet their face beforehand? Once I took it off I immediately noticed how much oil was drawn out of my pores (I have very oily skin) and my face didn&#x27;t feel dried out at all like it does with some products. Also I had a couple of zits, and the next morning when I woke up, they were either gone, or had come to a little white head so they could be quickly taken care of. To me it smells like herbal essences shampoo, and as someone who doesn&#x27;t do too well with overly scented products it really didn&#x27;t give me any unwanted redness. I really like this product and will absolutely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Feels nice, though not sure it does anything for my blackheads.</li>
    <li> This is a perfectly fine cleansing product that does not irritate and rinses off easily.  The self heating feature is kind of gimmicky and pointless - when you put it on your damp skin, there is a very brief flash of warmth.  It is not long enough to dilate vessels or open pores.  If you want to do that, you need to stand over a steaming basin of water with a towel over your head, or live in the tropics. But it was so cold this winter that a self warming product was seductive.</li>
    <li> Decent product was nice and actually warmed up your face but didn&#x27;t give me some blemishes. Seem to make my face a little greasy a couple hours later.</li>
    <li> This product is pretty fantastic. It is super easy to use, and the warming sensation feels phenomenal on the skin. The color isn&#x27;t super pleasant, however. Also, I&#x27;m not convinced that this is the best quick-mask available, but it does work if you continue using them. The price isn&#x27;t bad since you get three treatments. I will definitely purchase these again, along with other, less-quick acting masks.</li>
    <li> After using this product, my face feels fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually splash my face with water and then immediately put all of the product on my face. When I begin rubbing it onto my face, it heats up. (like it says it does!)(I&#x27;m not sure what the heat is suppose to do, but it does feel great) When I wash it off my pores feel opened and tingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if it is actually &amp;#34;drawing out impurities and trapping them&amp;#34; but my face does feel a lot cleaner after I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very easy to use and I would recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I have dry to normal skin combination and I use the product about every two months.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife and she seems to like it quite well.  I tried a package myself in order to write this review, but I wasn&#x27;t as enamored with the product as she seems to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the chemical reaction that makes it feel mildly warm for a second or two didn&#x27;t really enhance the experience at all, and the texture made me feel like I was rubbing a Clif Bar into my face.  I left the mask on for the suggested amount of time and then rinsed it off.  I felt like it left a film on my face, and I didn&#x27;t really like the after feeling.  Regarding the warming feeling, if I didn&#x27;t know it was supposed to have that, I might have missed it altogether.  Maybe that&#x27;s just me and the way my face perceives heat though.  I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my wife seemed to really like this product, I felt I should split the difference and give the product three stars.</li>
    <li> So you apply the mask to the face and it warms up and you leave it on for around 20 minutes.  It is a strong cleanser and probably shouldn&#x27;t be used more than a couple of times a week.  The directions are fairly simple, you should apply to a clean face, and then you let the mask sit.  I would recommend it.  It was a good mask, but there are many out there to try.  This one is worth a try, especially if you happen to like other Biore products.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It heats up as you apply it to your face, which feels great! When you wash it off, it has a cool and refreshing feeling. I love the light, fresh smell of this product too. My face feels moisturized and my pores feel clean and tight after use. It has no irritation to the eyes at all. I always feel like I&#x27;m pampered when I use this, the only thing I wish for is if someone else could apply this to me while I lay down, prop up my feet, and close my eyes. Heavenly!</li>
    <li> I am an active person and have been using some serious surf-grade zinc sunscreen during my pool and trail running training this summer. The sunscreen I use is super waterproof and doesn&#x27;t rub off; however, it&#x27;s so heavy that it clogs your pores. I have been using the Biore mask once every weekend to clean everything that my nightly face scrub cannot. I follow the directions and then use a warm towel to get at any stubborn pore. Like others have mentioned, the warming sensation only lasts for 3 seconds, but I&#x27;m more interested in the beads and fresh sensation afterwards. Doing the mask has helped me continue my regular face regime zit-free even when wearing paint almost every day.</li>
    <li> This product made me break out worse.</li>
    <li> I love the way this mask heats up after you put it on. It really makes it feel like it is working hard to clean your pores. I have really been enjoying these and will most likely repurchase.</li>
    <li> I saw no results from using these one minute masks and when looking at the ingredients I noticed that Biore has actually used BHT preservative in it which ultimately was a deal sealer that I was not going to finish the box!</li>
    <li> these things work very well. I have recently fallen in love with biore products and this one has kept the ball rolling. Heats up as soon as it touches your skin. Washes of easy and leaves your face feeling very clean.</li>
    <li> This mask is the best mask I have ever tried!&lt;br /&gt;Things I like most...&lt;br /&gt;1- Comes in individual packets that have enough to cover generously&lt;br /&gt;2- Immediately feels warm on your skin so you know it&#x27;s working&lt;br /&gt;3- Only leave on for one minute, no other mask only requires 1 minute for results&lt;br /&gt;4- When you rinse off you immediately see changes, glowy skin, reduced redness from acne and even skin tone&lt;br /&gt;5- Blackheads are all but gone after only 1 mask&lt;br /&gt;6- Inexpensive, I don&#x27;t know if more expensive brands work better but it&#x27;s charcoal so I&#x27;m not sure how you can dress that up to make it work differently by brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read about charcoal on a famous magazine website and thought I may as well jump on the bandwagon and see what the rage is!  I&#x27;m so happy I went with biore brand on this and not some of the more expensive alternatives.  I&#x27;m sold!</li>
    <li> I always love this mask. I used to buy it in Meijer, but they no longer stock it after they run out.&lt;br /&gt;I apply the mask 1st. After rinsing my face, I use the nose pore stripe. It actually get rid of a lot of dirty blackheads out.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this product on Amazon but I did get it from walmart. This is a warning. I used this for one use cause I broke out bad and the next morning after my skin started peeling off as if I had a sun burn. I dunno what happened but I used this as the directions said to. I was really sad cause I was really hoping that it would work for me but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
