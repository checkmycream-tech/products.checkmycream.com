      <li>Both the shampoo and conditioner smell wonderful</li>
      <li>Packages perfectly.</li>
      <li>best shampoo&#x27;s I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
      <li>I read an article about the best non-salon shampoo brands out there and John Frieda was listed.  </li>

      <li>I have been using the John Freida Brilliant Brunette products for years - probably close to a decade.  </li>
      <li>I decided to buy this shampoo or Pantene&#x27;s  Brunette Expressions at Walgreens, but they didn&#x27;t have it in stock and the John Frieda Brilliant Brunette was buy one, get one 50% off.</li>

      <li>Using this with the matching conditioner keeps my hair looking good and healthy!  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know that this brings out any more shine to my hair, but it feels great, and paired with an anti-frizz curl/wave booster I like the finished look on days I want to spare a blow dryer.</li>
      <li>I probably would have been more happy if my hair was either untreated or highlighted with reddish tones.</li>
      <li>On top of that the shampoo smells very nice.</li>

      <li>My wife purchased this and is satisfied with the results.  </li>
      <li>Everything was OK, all in time</li>
      <li>My favorite shampoo.</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>Our favorite shampoo/conditioner.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>and it was ok</li>
      <li>I also wanted to mention, that my hair is really healthy because I never dye it</li>
      <li>Fantastic!</li>
      <li>I am glad I bought both shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
      <li>At first, I loved it.</li>
      <li>I loved it from the first use.  </li>
      <li>My hair is fine &amp; I always use conditioner after shampooing.</li>
      <li>the color of my hair, giving it a reddish sheen that was quite visible in strong light.</li>
      <li>With Prime free shipping, you can&#x27;t beat the price on Amazon for a two pack since purchasing one at Target/Walgreens etc</li>
      <li>Hold my color in well and leaves my hair silky smooth.</li>
      <li>Got a free bottle of this when I tried the foaming hair color.</li>
      <li>I have layered, naturally brunette, past-my-shoulder straight hair and it is easily combed, dries quick, smells great, and has fabulous luster.  </li>
      <li>I use this shampoo daily, and love how it has a very sophisticated smell (not overly fruity - sweet without being too girly).</li>
      <li>My hair always feels clean without that waxy build up you can get from a shampoo.</li>
      <li>I LOVED the John Freida for red heads !</li>
      <li>Good basic shampoo for color treated hair.  </li>
      <li>I am currently located in an area without a source of good, treated water.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, true to its name, it did &amp;#34;enhance&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I have been happy with other John Frieda products that I have used</li>
      <li>But my hair does look better overall, healthier, shinier, and better color depth, than when I don&#x27;t use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>She said they keep your hair color from fading as quickly.</li>
      <li>Product arrived quickly and was as advertised.</li>
      <li>My new favorite shampoo.</li>
      <li>Its my first time I use this product ,and so far I liked the shampoo.</li>
      <li>But now I&#x27;m noticing that my hair feels more and more like straw, and I have never, ever had dry hair.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair and don&#x27;t like to color any more often than necessary.  </li>
      <li>I alternate shampoo and conditioner products and this seems to be an inexpensive product with nice results.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth a try to see if you like the results.</li>
      <li>Getting the two pack was economical.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own and brushed it out.</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo - cleans well &amp; doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Nice shampoo, and at a relatively competitive price for a 2 pack!</li>
      <li>I use it for my dark blond hair with highlights, i do not want my blond highlights to turn blonder , rather want to keep the kind of hair color that Jennifer Anniston has and this product helps. !</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s not even the right product for my hair</li>
      <li>My hair felt drier than usual, but it did smell great, as if I just came out of the salon and it was shiny.</li>
      <li>It smelled amazing and left my hair super soft !</li>
      <li>The product is quality and does exactly what it says.</li>
      <li>I have light brown hair that naturally lightens in the summer.  </li>
      <li>I inspected the new replacements and there weren&#x27;t any holes, but Amazon/customer service knew that the original one they sent me came damaged so I was really hoping they would take more precautionary measures the second time</li>
      <li>It is hard to explain, but even with it looking a bit more shiny, it also looked more brittle.</li>
      <li>the different tones in my hair are now more pronounced and it makes my hair look much shinier.</li>
      <li>I started using John Frieda products a while back because my sister used them and loved them several years ago, and I wanted to see how they did with my hair.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I loved how the one for red heads left my hair</li>
      <li>Moisture shampoo wasn&#x27;t my first choice, but it ended up working really well.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair full and soft.</li>
      <li>My hair is super soft - like silk, and not just shiny</li>
      <li>It is also a way thicker shampoo than I am used to, but I have found that thickness is actually a great thing because it moisturizes my hair unlike other shampoos that dry out my hair.  </li>
      <li>I have long dark hair with gold highlights and every time I use this shampoo people comment how great my hair looks</li>
      <li>I usually really like the John Frieda products.  </li>
      <li>I was not expecting the shampoo and the rest of the John Frieda family to be as gentle on my hair as it is.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I LOVED the John Freida for red heads ! It smelled amazing and left my hair super soft ! NOW this one I don&#x27;t know why but &#x3D;/ my hair began to feel very dry shortly after beginning to use this product ! I know for a fact my hair wasn&#x27;t damage prior because I cut my ends often , I didn&#x27;t dye my hair months prior to using it. I loved how the one for red heads left my hair so I had the same expectations for this one. Sadly it didn&#x27;t live up to it. SO I now use the shampoo and conditioner to shave my legs lol</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really sure if it really does anything special to bring out the &amp;#34;shine and tone&amp;#34; of my hair, but it makes my hair feel clean, sleek, and soft. And my boyfriend LOVES the smell. Win.</li>
    <li> First use left made my dark brown dyed hair so soft, shiny,  from dull, frizzy, and lifeless.  I have used this brand before, but be a hair dye addict, who can&#x27;t choose and stick with one shade. I have grown so tired of playing hair dye &amp;#34;musical chairs&amp;#34;  that I decide to go back to my natural shade- dark brown.  I was a light blonde, before coloring it back to dark brown. My hair was of course damaged, frizzy ends ( my hair is  3 inches past my collar bone),  and dry.  I went through some shampoo and conditioners I already had.  I decided to buy this shampoo or Pantene&#x27;s  Brunette Expressions at Walgreens, but they didn&#x27;t have it in stock and the John Frieda Brilliant Brunette was buy one, get one 50% off. I am glad I bought both shampoo and conditioner.  Now I have my soft, shiny, silky smooth hair back.  If it can turn my over dyed, damaged hair into  the hair you see on shampoo ad models, then it should work for you.</li>
    <li> Fantastic! This is one of the all time best shampoo&#x27;s I&#x27;ve ever used and I have tried them all, especially the expensive ones that don&#x27;t work any better. I only wash my hair every third day. I have long dark hair with gold highlights and every time I use this shampoo people comment how great my hair looks and if I just got new hi-lights. It&#x27; crazy and amazing how this shampoo makes the hi-lites pop!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice and concentrated and cleans well. I also like the smell.&lt;br /&gt;I hope they never discontinue it.</li>
    <li> I tried out the John Frieda Brilliant Brunette Shampoo, because I wanted to jazz up my brown hair. I have brown hair that is natural with no processing and I barely even dry, curl, or flat iron it. My hair would be what you call healthy. When I started to wash my hair, it lathered up well and had a very pleasant scent. My hair felt dry as I lathered it up with the shampoo, more than it ever has prior to using this shampoo. I rinsed out the shampoo and used the recommended matching conditioner. I let my hair dry on it&#x27;s own and brushed it out. My hair felt drier than usual, but it did smell great, as if I just came out of the salon and it was shiny. It is hard to explain, but even with it looking a bit more shiny, it also looked more brittle. My hair also felt soft and was very manageable, but as I said before, it also felt a bit dry. I am right in the middle on my feelings about the product. It&#x27;s not bad, but not great.</li>
    <li> Good basic shampoo for color treated hair.  Smells great and I use all John Frieda products, but I don&#x27;t know if it has made my color last longer.  Water is the culprit for stripping color from your hair and I have to wash my hair.</li>
    <li> I normally buy the conditioner and occasionally the shampoo as well.  I notice a big difference in how long my hair color lasts when I use this product.  I have fine hair and don&#x27;t like to color any more often than necessary.  I also have a lot of gray hair, so it just stretches out my color and I like that!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know that this brings out any more shine to my hair, but it feels great, and paired with an anti-frizz curl/wave booster I like the finished look on days I want to spare a blow dryer.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo! My hair always feels clean without that waxy build up you can get from a shampoo. Product arrived quickly and was as advertised.</li>
    <li> I love John Frieda products, I use this to keep my hair even toned between appointments, sometimes I alternate in the summer with the high lightening version, to add extra definition. Love the auto ship!</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo for me. I have light red hair and it revives the color and tints the white hair.. I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s called brunette. Leaves my hair full and soft.</li>
    <li> Its my first time I use this product ,and so far I liked the shampoo. it definitely gives some extra volume although I did not look for it, and hair look healthier</li>
    <li> Love John Frieda Brilliant Brunette products.  Helps bring out the different tones of browns in my hair, keeps my hair shiny and soft.  My favorite shampoo.</li>
    <li> In terms of the texture and health of my hair, I didn&#x27;t notice too much of a difference between this shampoo and any other shampoo I can pull off of a drugstore shelf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, true to its name, it did &amp;#34;enhance&amp;#34; the color of my hair, giving it a reddish sheen that was quite visible in strong light. I wasn&#x27;t pleased with this effect, since my hair sports a blonde bayalage treatment, which looked odd when paired with the redness of the shampoo. I probably would have been more happy if my hair was either untreated or highlighted with reddish tones.</li>
    <li> I read an article about the best non-salon shampoo brands out there and John Frieda was listed.  I saw this in the store a few days later.  I loved it from the first use.  I have light brown hair that naturally lightens in the summer.  It seemed that after using this, the highlights looked rich and even brought a very subtle reddish color in.  Both the shampoo and conditioner smell wonderful and I&#x27;m going to continue to use it.  My new favorite shampoo.</li>
    <li> Cleans well, smells good, makes hair shiny. My hair is fine &amp; I always use conditioner after shampooing.</li>
    <li> Everything was OK, all in time</li>
    <li> My wife purchased this and is satisfied with the results.  Hair was very dry and &amp;#34;straw&amp;#34; looking.  just after one use of the shampoo and conditioner noticed a difference.  After continued use hair is softer and shinier.  will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo and conditioner for several years.  Hold my color in well and leaves my hair silky smooth.</li>
    <li> Seems to do a nice job.  I alternate shampoo and conditioner products and this seems to be an inexpensive product with nice results.  It&#x27;s definitely worth a try to see if you like the results.</li>
    <li> Using this with the matching conditioner keeps my hair looking good and healthy!  Have been using John Frieda products for a couple of years, now.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo! I have been using it for about 10 years or so. My hair loves this shampoo!</li>
    <li> it made my hair look like I hadn&#x27;t showered in a week</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. This review isn&#x27;t about the shampoo being less than par. It&#x27;s about Amazon&#x27;s shipping policy. When this first came in the mail (in a box), there were three holes on the back of one of the bottles. Shampoo was leaking everywhere so I decided to ask for a replacement. When I got the replacement in the mail, it came in one of those big envelopes (not a box). I inspected the new replacements and there weren&#x27;t any holes, but Amazon/customer service knew that the original one they sent me came damaged so I was really hoping they would take more precautionary measures the second time around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I just had a bad experience. But I will no longer purchase shampoo from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Results are shiny and soft, much less fly-away on my very fine hair.</li>
    <li> The product is quality and does exactly what it says. It will make your hair very soft and will bring out all the different shades of brown in your hair. On top of that the shampoo smells very nice. The guys can use this too, not just for women. However if you have blonde hair and are trying to use this to darken your hair don&#x27;t bother. These shampoos are non color depositing. They are only meant for brunettes. If you&#x27;re trying to darken your hair, try other natural alternatives. This is a great shampoo that will enhance the brown tones in your hair and make it shine.</li>
    <li> Got a free bottle of this when I tried the foaming hair color. At first, I loved it. It smells heavenly. But now I&#x27;m noticing that my hair feels more and more like straw, and I have never, ever had dry hair. I do not recommend, especially if you have dry hair naturally.</li>
    <li> Our favorite shampoo/conditioner.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shampoo and conditioner. I love that I can get it so affordably through Amazon. I love the scent, I love the way my hair feels. It is a great product.</li>
    <li> I usually really like the John Frieda products.  This particular one, I&#x27;m not a huge fan of.  I just didn&#x27;t have the same results as some of the other reviewers.  I felt it was drying.  It didn&#x27;t add shine or do anything to enhance my brunette hair.  I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells a little bit like coconut and leaves my hair healthy and soft.  I tend to avoid moisture shampoos, because I tend to have rather oily hair.  However, my hair never looks greasy with this, but is bright and bouncy.  Plus, my hairstylist says my hair looks ridiculously healthy (which usually gets her acting like an artist in front a blank canvas, just ready to make a mark).  Definitely a favorite shampoo.</li>
    <li> This product made my hair dry, brittle, and frizzy. It smelled nice but that&#x27;s about it. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this shampoo and conditioner!  My hair is dyed a very dark brown, and the shampoo and conditioner helps keep the color shiny and rich in between visits to my colorist.  With Prime free shipping, you can&#x27;t beat the price on Amazon for a two pack since purchasing one at Target/Walgreens etc will cost you $6.99!</li>
    <li> Nice shampoo. Hard to find locally.</li>
    <li> Prior to this shampoo I used a salon product that was recommended by the hair salon and it was ok but I didn&#x27;t wanna pay that kinda money again. So I picked up this product at the local store and I&#x27;m amazed!! My hair is super soft - like silk, and not just shiny but it brings out all the brown facettes of my natural brown hair! I also wanted to mention, that my hair is really healthy because I never dye it, I just flat iron it now and then and I always had the problem that my hair was rather on the frizzy/dry side. No frizziness with this product at all! I use the JF shampoo and conditioner for brunettes) Before I always had to use something like Argan Oil for the lengths to get it smoother... LOVE IT!</li>

    <li> I was not expecting the shampoo and the rest of the John Frieda family to be as gentle on my hair as it is.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay but I didn&#x27;t think it lived up to the 5-star reviews that I read.</li>
    <li> I have been using the John Freida Brilliant Brunette products for years - probably close to a decade.  Any time I switched, I was disappointed with my hair&#x27;s shine, manageability, and overall feeling.  The two stylists I have seen consistently in the past (2 because I moved states) always remarked how healthy my hair looked and felt when I used JF and nothing else.&lt;br /&gt;About 2 years ago, I found large pump-top bottles at my local bullseye store.  I buy these 2 packs on Amazon as refills, and everyday my hair looks fabulous.  I have layered, naturally brunette, past-my-shoulder straight hair and it is easily combed, dries quick, smells great, and has fabulous luster.  Love this line!!</li>
    <li> I have been happy with other John Frieda products that I have used so I decided to give this a try for my dull looking hair. As I got older my hair went from blonde to a very dark brown, and I have been frustrated by my flat colored and dull hair. This product really works though - the different tones in my hair are now more pronounced and it makes my hair look much shinier. It is also a way thicker shampoo than I am used to, but I have found that thickness is actually a great thing because it moisturizes my hair unlike other shampoos that dry out my hair.  This also leaves my hair feeling softer.</li>
    <li> I ordered this two pack expecting the \\&quot;Shine Release Moisture Shampoo for All Shades\\&quot;, what i received was \\&quot;Multi-tone revealing shampoo\\&quot;. That&#x27;s not the same product- what I received says it&#x27;s for \\&quot;Natural or Highlighted Brunette.\\&quot; I&#x27;m all-voer semi-permanent brunette- so it&#x27;s not even the right product for my hair color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointing I didn&#x27;t receive the right product.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo - cleans well &amp; doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I started using John Frieda products a while back because my sister used them and loved them several years ago, and I wanted to see how they did with my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Moisture shampoo wasn&#x27;t my first choice, but it ended up working really well. I am currently located in an area without a source of good, treated water. Moreover, the climate is VERY dry. So far, my hair hasn&#x27;t suffered from any of the effects one would normally expect, and I attribute this to this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair isn&#x27;t dry at all - and it maintains its body and shape all day, even with daily, sometimes multiple, washes. I use the conditioner and I think the products give you the best result when used together. I see a lot of nice reddish highlights after using this shampoo that fade gradually when I don&#x27;t use it. It&#x27;s not a dye, and it&#x27;s not henna, because the grey is still there front and center :). But my hair does look better overall, healthier, shinier, and better color depth, than when I don&#x27;t use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those who are sensitive to almond oil, as I am, should be aware that there is a small amount of it in these products.</li>
    <li> I use it for my dark blond hair with highlights, i do not want my blond highlights to turn blonder , rather want to keep the kind of hair color that Jennifer Anniston has and this product helps. ! Give it a try, it is a great price and has a nice wonderful almond smell.&lt;br /&gt;Also recommend the matching Conditioner, a little goes a long way&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have big , long hair and love the john frieda line over l&#x27;oreal or redken etc.</li>
    <li> Wonderful shampoo.  Left my hair very soft and made the colors glow.  I have highlights and low lights and was surprised after using this shampoo how the colors were richer in appearance.  I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> Decent price for decent shampoo.</li>
    <li> Getting the two pack was economical. I use this product all of the time! The price with coupon was phenominal. Packages perfectly. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Recently I switched to using John Frieda hair coloring products. A friend told me about John Frieda shampoo and conditioner for brunettes. She said they keep your hair color from fading as quickly. She was correct, they do. I have been using these products for several months now. My coloring lasts longer, nor does it get brassy. So far, the best non-sale price I found is on Amazon. The best sale price I found matches Amazon prices, until you factor in the cost of gas, etc. I take the cost of gas, wear on my car, and my time into consideration when I calculate cost savings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Helps color last longer&lt;br /&gt;Brings out the color highlights&lt;br /&gt;Lathers well&lt;br /&gt;A little bit goes a long way - I have shoulder length hair - use approximately 25 cent piece size amount&lt;br /&gt;Travels well - I like the tube concept&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;I cannot think of any at this time</li>
    <li> This stuff is really great. I use this shampoo daily, and love how it has a very sophisticated smell (not overly fruity - sweet without being too girly). I&#x27;m Asian with very very dark brown/nearly soft black hair, so if my hair is dull at all it gets very boring. This shampoo gives me enough shine to bring out all the highlights that I usually can&#x27;t see unless I&#x27;m standing in direct sunlight. Nice shampoo, and at a relatively competitive price for a 2 pack!</li>
    <li> Great price for this product.Got it for about half  of the price found in department and drug stores.&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo leaves  hair soft and silky.</li>
