      <li>I couldn&#x27;t find this in the stores anymore and was excited to find it on amazon.</li>
      <li>been using this product for years, well worth the price if you value your sweet lips!</li>

      <li>;)</li>
      <li>but, this one, they didn&#x27;t do so hot on.</li>
      <li>Much cheaper here!</li>
      <li>I was looking forward to receiving a good quality lip balm because the winter has been so harsh.  </li>
      <li>Most chapstick&#x27;s make my lips dry</li>
      <li>However, I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>I really like the lip balm.</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing lip blalm.</li>
      <li>, it has really made a difference and there is no odor or aftertaste.  </li>
      <li>Fast delivery as well.</li>
      <li>HEMPZ Herbal Lip Balm is awesome, the other Lip Balms that comes close is Neutrogena Lip tube and Lipology, but Lipology is hard to come by at Ulta, who used to carry the product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a decent product, although I think it&#x27;s a bit overpriced, but so is the lotion.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this lip balm.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Yes, it has &amp;#34;100% Pure Natural Hemp Seed Oil&amp;#34; BUT it also contains Petrolatum, Aspartame and 2 kinds of paraben.  </li>
      <li>Not only is this a long time favorite of mine, my husband steals a tube every time i get some.</li>
      <li>and I am always trying new lip balm.</li>
      <li>Also has a very soft inviting scent.</li>
      <li>I use it every night before bed and my lips are soft and luscious.</li>
      <li>when applied prior to tanning lips are still moist n soft after.</li>
      <li>The smell or taste isn&#x27;t strong or overpowering, it&#x27;s a subtle citrus smell</li>
      <li>Overall it&#x27;s a little pricey but worth it.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive lips as well as very dry lips, especially in the winter.</li>

<li> I wasted my $$ on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> However when I got it I was unpleasantly surprised to see that it&#x27;s made of petroleum-based chemicals that smell bad.</li>
<li> DO NOT love this one because of  inferior ingredients used!</li>
<li> The balm is thick and unappealing to use.</li>
<li> but unfortunately contains some artificial ingredients I was not aware of</li>
<li> Just can&#x27;t use it :-(</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s ok.  Would I buy it again?  Maybe</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Works amazing to keep lips moisturized.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing lip blalm. It&#x27;s my favorite. I keep them all over the house.</li>
    <li> I have had such a hard time in the past finding a lip product that I can use on a consistent basis.  Most chapstick&#x27;s make my lips dry or I have to re-apply them way too often.  This lasts a long time, goes on smooth, and feels really nice on your lips.</li>
    <li> Why why why!&lt;br /&gt;This product contains aspartame!! :(&lt;br /&gt;So disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE the hemp lotions.&lt;br /&gt;I DO NOT love this one because of  inferior ingredients used!</li>
    <li> Nice lip balm. Nice flavor.</li>
    <li> Smells good and nourishes sun-tanned lips! Use after tanning. I first stumbled across this product at a tanning salon and fell in love. Much cheaper here!</li>
    <li> wasn&#x27;t too impressed with this lip balm. It is an ok product. I bought this item for work and i think i still use my good old orginal car mike lip balm.</li>

    <li> I bought this for my wife. It was a stocking stuffer. She is a lip balm aficionado.  she loves this stuff.  will buy again .</li>
    <li> This product dries my lips out. I don&#x27;t recommend this product at all. I love Hempz products but, this one, they didn&#x27;t do so hot on.</li>
    <li> This product feels great on the lips.  Leaves a nice shiny look and also tastes great.  My family loves it too.  I had to buy more just to keep mine from disappearing all the time.</li>
    <li> Best lip stuff ever!!!!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this in the stores anymore and was excited to find it on amazon. I use it every night before bed and my lips are soft and luscious. ;)</li>
    <li> Very good lip balm, moisturizes and softens well. Also has a very soft inviting scent. The only reason this product didn&#x27;t get all five stars, it was a little pricey for just a lip balm.</li>
    <li> I foolishly believed I could trust the Hempz name.  I was looking forward to receiving a good quality lip balm because the winter has been so harsh.  When it arrived and I read the ingredients, I was appalled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it has &amp;#34;100% Pure Natural Hemp Seed Oil&amp;#34; BUT it also contains Petrolatum, Aspartame and 2 kinds of paraben.  JEEZ!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even soda makers are now bragging that they have taken aspartame out of diet soda but here it is in the Hempz lip balm I wasted my $$ on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy this garbage.</li>
    <li> Nice scent and texture. No stickiness. However, I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> My lips were dry when I received the balm, I applied it about three times in one day and now my lips are softer than ever! The smell or taste isn&#x27;t strong or overpowering, it&#x27;s a subtle citrus smell and it tastes sweet. Overall it&#x27;s a little pricey but worth it.</li>
    <li> been using this product for years, well worth the price if you value your sweet lips! my lip are in best condition ever in past 48 years!</li>
    <li> Love it!! I am prone to chapped lips and this product is a miracle.</li>
    <li> I put this on before bed at night so the moisture can sink in.  Has a mild to no taste and feels great.</li>
    <li> Love this lip balm! I had a problem with cracked lips until I used this hemp seed oil lip balm. I am in love. I will use nothing else from now on. Fast delivery as well.</li>
    <li> If it wasn&#x27;t for the fact this made my lips chapped I would give it a 5 stars. Other then that I loved it. Just can&#x27;t use it :-(</li>
    <li> Great for your lips, and it feels wonderful, and it&#x27;s worth buying!!!  If you have chapped lips, this will solve your problem!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best lip balm ever made! This is my second tube. It lasts a long time, and does a very good job.</li>
    <li> I have a Vitamin B deficiency and my lips are ALWAYS peeling, I have tried everything!!!  I LOVE this Hempz, it has really made a difference and there is no odor or aftertaste.  THANK YOU!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best lip balm I have ever used. Nothing in stores compares. Lasts incredibly long. Great value. I always keep two on hand.</li>
    <li> Delicious! Makes my lips super soft and taste amazing. I highly recommend this lip balm. I WILL be buying this again. :)</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry lips and I am always trying new lip balm. This is by far one of the best. My top picks are hempz and beauti control.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Hempz lotions for years, so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  It&#x27;s a decent product, although I think it&#x27;s a bit overpriced, but so is the lotion.  I like the feel and the smell.  I actually received a pink one that is apparently a &amp;#34;Limited Edition&amp;#34;, although I have no idea what makes it so.  I also noticed the both the pink one I received and the one pictured are for 0.44oz, even though this product is listed at .5oz.</li>
    <li> Because this is the best I have ever used. I had received it as a gift a year or so ago and will never use anything else.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect lip balm. It can be used in the summer or the winter and the results are nothing but phenomenal. It&#x27;s hydrating and moisturizing, leaving your lips feel silky smooth.</li>
    <li> I love how soft n silky it makes my lips feel n when applied prior to tanning lips are still moist n soft after.</li>
    <li> I generally love Hempz skin products so thought I&#x27;d try their herbal lip balm. However when I got it I was unpleasantly surprised to see that it&#x27;s made of petroleum-based chemicals that smell bad. The balm is thick and unappealing to use. I threw it out and bought Burts Bees instead.</li>
    <li> I always used one other product that was harder and harder to find in the stores, so I tried this. I have very sensitive lips as well as very dry lips, especially in the winter. This balm is by far the best I have found so far and I will continue to keep buying it as long as they keep making it. It is creamy with the best hint of lemon taste. I adore it!</li>
    <li> Good moisturizing properties but unfortunately contains some artificial ingredients I was not aware of so I will just use it sparingly.</li>
    <li> Silky smooth and soothing.</li>
    <li> Best I ever had,makes your lips soft&lt;br /&gt;Will be buying more in the future&lt;br /&gt;And giving it away as gifts</li>
    <li> I really like the lip balm. I would purchase it again.</li>
