      <li>This one is more durable than others she has had and does a great job.</li>
      <li>I love these eyelash curlers!</li>
      <li>so I was expecting amazing results after reading the reviews.</li>
      <li>The curler itself seems to be nicely made, but not as substantial as others I&#x27;ve had before.</li>
      <li>Gives good curl to eyelashes and easy to use.</li>
      <li>My 16 year old is very happy with this product.  </li>
      <li>It came with a vial of replacement purple cushions that I&#x27;ll probably lose before I need them, but the thought was nice. :)</li>
      <li>I love, love, love this product!</li>
      <li>The pads are very cushy, making the curling process super gentle on your lashes.  </li>
      <li>and I love them.</li>
      <li>return it for sure</li>
      <li>Perfect curve makes 95% eyelashs put in the same time.   </li>
      <li>I was in love with this eyelash curler for about a week or two.</li>
      <li>but I received 4 in total that is awesome.</li>
      <li>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, this curler</li>
      <li>They need to develop a better piece of rubber.  </li>
      <li>54 yo female using curlers for 40 years, best one I&#x27;ve ever used, it acturally fits your eye, you will not be dissappointed</li>
      <li>, i have tried several the best are revlon and lacross also cheap.    </li>
      <li>With that being said, most of the curlers on the market just don&#x27;t fit my eyes.</li>
      <li>Just do three easy squeezes.</li>
      <li>Perfect elasticity let eyelashs curled easily and quickly, so you don&#x27;t need to torture your eyelash for a long time.  </li>
      <li>The price is right, so why not?!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to say that this curler fits my eyes really well,</li>
      <li>(specially if it keeps her happy), but also comes w a refill, which her old one didnt have.  </li>
      <li>Gives them a rounded and smooth look.</li>
      <li>They do not give your lashes the &#x27;crimped&#x27; look, they are light weight yet have a durable feel and the purple pad is comfortable.</li>
      <li>Buying a cheap one is not saving money if you have to turn around and buy another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;shape&amp;#34; (curve of the product) doesn&#x27;t fit my eye; oherwise, i&#x27;d give it 5 stars.</li>
      <li>Comes with free replacement pads.  </li>
      <li>the quality is fantastic and works well.</li>
      <li>I decided to buy this particular pair after reading several of the reviews on Amazon(thanks to all who do-I am trying my best to do the same)so it pays to read and take the time to help others!!</li>
      <li>Then I travelled to Asia, and found a good curler that fit my eyes really well, but it is way over-priced in the states, so I didn&#x27;t want to spend that much money on it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited when I read such good things about the Tweezerman curler; I&#x27;d purchased the Shu, but it didn&#x27;t fit my eye</li>
      <li>...... right for me!</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t pull or yank on my eyelashes, the movement is good and feels like a solidly made item.</li>
      <li>Good enough that I bought one for my makeup kit as well.</li>
      <li>shu uemura&#x27;s eyelash curler is always rated above this and with good reason.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d recommend it to Asian girls like me that struggle to find a good lash curler.</li>
      <li>to me, it seems like a good tool in its respective field of tools.</li>
      <li>My lashes always come out uniformly curled, natural looking and (perhaps most importantly), the curls lasts all day (think 8am to 11pm).</li>
      <li>Extras are included but you will go through these quickly.</li>
      <li>Be VERY gentle with using it!</li>
      <li>i own about 5 and this curler took more than half my lashes</li>
      <li>Loved them, have bought many other brands, much more EXPENSIVE and these by far are the BEST!!</li>
      <li>I really does a fantastic job curling my lashes.</li>
      <li>curler is sturdy and works well and definitely worth spending the money.  </li>
      <li>well worth the money</li>
      <li>Works perfect, had it a little less then a year and still good as new.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is my second Tweezerman Classic, its consistently best for my big, almond-shaped eyes just as suggested years ago.</li>
      <li>She goes through eyelash curlers pretty quickly.  </li>
      <li>The price is right though, if you need to experiment.</li>
      <li>Thinking this would be better than a drugstore one for the extra expense I purchased it but</li>
      <li>It is the first eyelash curler I have</li>
      <li>really like this curler!</li>
      <li>I know curlers seem pretty much the same, but this one really has been my favorite.</li>
      <li>this is adequate but nowhere near what it could be.</li>
      <li>Tweezerman does curl my lashes very well, but it&#x27;s bound for the trash</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think this product curls my lashes much at all.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different styles and brands and these are now my favorite pair.</li>
      <li>I used them prior to putting on mascara and my lashes looked nice, natural and curled all day long.</li>
      <li>, so far I haven&#x27;t had to buy any as it came with a couple refills and they are really sturdy</li>
      <li>My Asian girl friends told me Tweezerman curler is worth a try.</li>
      <li>They last a long time, preform well, and I love that they come with 3 refills.</li>
      <li>I surprised by the high ratings.</li>
      <li>That little purple piece falls out too easily.</li>
      <li>Also, the curl is very natural and just opens up your eyes, giving you a and up-swept fringe that lasts all day (even without applying any mascara at all, which I do for a natural daytime look.)   </li>
      <li>found it is not as it doesn&#x27;t curl better even with a new purple piece in than the less expensive kind.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty equal opportunity when it comes to beauty products, so I often own a variety of brands, but I&#x27;ve used other tweezerman products since because of how much I&#x27;ve liked their eyelash curlers and have never been disappointed.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had a \\&quot;bald spot\\&quot; almost in the center of my right eyelid for over a month.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and it doesn&#x27;t destroy my lashes!</li>
      <li>I love that it comes with extra pads, usually they send you one extra one</li>
      <li>it just causes a crease across your lashes) or, over time, gets loose so that your lashes come out essentially as straight as they go in.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been curling my lashes since high school, a very long time ago, so I consider myself well versed in the technique.  </li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t have to squeeze super hard to get a curl.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t crimp lashes like cheap eyelash curlers usually do, and my stick straight thick lashes stay all day.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It curls.  Nothing wrong with the product.  The &amp;#34;shape&amp;#34; (curve of the product) doesn&#x27;t fit my eye; oherwise, i&#x27;d give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I have long but stubbornly straight lashes, and most curlers I have tried (including Lacrosse and Revlon) just sort of \\&quot;crimp\\&quot; my lashes, giving them sharp ridges and making my eyes look crazy.  This curler is a treat.  The pads are very cushy, making the curling process super gentle on your lashes.  Also, the curl is very natural and just opens up your eyes, giving you a and up-swept fringe that lasts all day (even without applying any mascara at all, which I do for a natural daytime look.)   Comes with free replacement pads.  I can&#x27;t rave enough about this eyelash curler.</li>
    <li> It took me a while to get used to this curler. At first I was a bit skeptical but its sturdy, doesn&#x27;t crimp my lashes and I know it will last a long time. I love that it comes with extra pads, usually they send you one extra one but I received 4 in total that is awesome. No complaints.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been curling my lashes since high school, a very long time ago, so I consider myself well versed in the technique.  Furthermore, if I were forced to choose only one beauty item to take with me to a desert island, it would probably be an eyelash curler, that&#x27;s how heavily I depend on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited when I read such good things about the Tweezerman curler; I&#x27;d purchased the Shu, but it didn&#x27;t fit my eye socket.&lt;br /&gt;The Tweezerman does curl my lashes very well, but it&#x27;s bound for the trash can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, like a couple of other reviewers mentioned, it has caused my lashes to fall out in clumps.  I&#x27;ve had a \\&quot;bald spot\\&quot; almost in the center of my right eyelid for over a month.  The lashes are finally coming back, but I still have to fill in the area with pencil.  I haven&#x27;t had to do that since I stupidly left makeup on my fingers before curling my lashes; fingers slipped in the handle, and half of my eyelid was bald.  That was a hard lesson; this is another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to hunting for a great curler.</li>
    <li> I have a few different types of tweezerman eyelash curlers (there&#x27;s also a black plastic version with a slightly different \\&quot;pressing\\&quot; mechanism out there) and I love them. My lashes always come out uniformly curled, natural looking and (perhaps most importantly), the curls lasts all day (think 8am to 11pm). It even looks good without mascara. I&#x27;ve used Revlon&#x27;s lash curlers and find that they either causes the dreaded \\&quot;l-shape\\&quot; (where, instead of curling, it clamps down so hard it just causes a crease across your lashes) or, over time, gets loose so that your lashes come out essentially as straight as they go in. I&#x27;m pretty equal opportunity when it comes to beauty products, so I often own a variety of brands, but I&#x27;ve used other tweezerman products since because of how much I&#x27;ve liked their eyelash curlers and have never been disappointed.</li>
    <li> My 16 year old is very happy with this product.  She goes through eyelash curlers pretty quickly.  This one is more durable than others she has had and does a great job.</li>
    <li> I wish the rubber used for it was softer. The curler itself seems to be nicely made, but not as substantial as others I&#x27;ve had before. I like the size and the shape of it.</li>
    <li> The best eyelash curler I have ever bought and I have bought plenty. Gives you a great curl even if you are not going to use mascara. I will never buy any other curler....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had two of these now, and they are great. I also have the newer version with the blue refills, and I have to say I don&#x27;t notice a difference between the two. They don&#x27;t crimp lashes like cheap eyelash curlers usually do, and my stick straight thick lashes stay all day. I have given them out as stocking stuffers year after year. They last a long time, preform well, and I love that they come with 3 refills. You don&#x27;t have to squeeze super hard to get a curl. Just do three easy squeezes.</li>
    <li> Perfect curve makes 95% eyelashs put in the same time.   Perfect elasticity let eyelashs curled easily and quickly, so you don&#x27;t need to torture your eyelash for a long time.  This curler is just so...... right for me!</li>
    <li> The purple piece of rubber doesn&#x27;t stay in, it became loose and kept falling out after a short time.  Extras are included but you will go through these quickly. They need to develop a better piece of rubber.  Thinking this would be better than a drugstore one for the extra expense I purchased it but found it is not as it doesn&#x27;t curl better even with a new purple piece in than the less expensive kind. Never had issues with the rubber piece falling out with the drugstore brand.</li>
    <li> That little purple piece falls out too easily.</li>
    <li> shu uemura&#x27;s eyelash curler is always rated above this and with good reason.  it is the best.  this is adequate but nowhere near what it could be.</li>
    <li> I have almond-shaped eyes with monolid and the tweezerman is a generally good quality eyelash curler. It is the first eyelash curler I have and I&#x27;m still keeping it and have no intention to replace it. The product came 5 days faster than the estimated date, too, which is a plus.</li>
    <li> I was in love with this eyelash curler for about a week or two. Then I noticed my eyelashes were really starting to fall out, and all in one spot....now I have this bald patch with no lashes. It looks so weird! In all the years I&#x27;ve used an eyelash curler, I&#x27;ve never had this issue before. Be VERY gentle with using it! Perhaps I was squeezing too hard.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and it doesn&#x27;t destroy my lashes! It gets the job done and does it well. Recommended.</li>
    <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, this curler, that&#x27;s all I will use!</li>
    <li> I have really long eyelashes so I was expecting amazing results after reading the reviews. I just use a clear mascara so that may have been the problem as it has less substance than a colored mascara. The price is right though, if you need to experiment.</li>
    <li> Works perfect, had it a little less then a year and still good as new. I bought this because you can buy refills for it, so far I haven&#x27;t had to buy any as it came with a couple refills and they are really sturdy (I squeeze my eyelash curler hard!). I used to have to buy refills every month or so. Everything about this is perfect</li>
    <li> I love these eyelash curlers! Very impressive for the price. They do not give your lashes the &#x27;crimped&#x27; look, they are light weight yet have a durable feel and the purple pad is comfortable. I&#x27;ve tried several different styles and brands and these are now my favorite pair. Very simple to use, covers the entire lash area area which is hard to find with eyelash curlers. I used them prior to putting on mascara and my lashes looked nice, natural and curled all day long.I decided to buy this particular pair after reading several of the reviews on Amazon(thanks to all who do-I am trying my best to do the same)so it pays to read and take the time to help others!! Bottom line if you want an inexpensive pair of eyelash curlers that don&#x27;t crimp and keep your lashes curled you need a pair of these.</li>
    <li> this is the worst curler ever!!  i own about 5 and this curler took more than half my lashes, i have tried several the best are revlon and lacross also cheap.    this took a lot lashes of my eyes and now im afraid to use any at all, i called the company and they were happy to take it with a refund but i have to pay shipping to send it in, UPS or USPS insured mail...    i&#x27;ll say stick with revlon (have bought 4 but keep loosign them, or lacross (had 3) this are all good and cheaper...</li>
    <li> Very good buy.  Works well.</li>
    <li> Of all the eyelash curlers I&#x27;ve bought over the years(many!),  this one fits my eye with little pinching.  I don&#x27;t think it curls quite as well as others but am happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Gives good curl to eyelashes and easy to use.</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler was nowhere near what I expected it to be. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because the purple pad is too squishy but every time I use this eyelash curler it pinches the corner of my lids. I&#x27;ve found another lash curler since purchasing this one and it only pinches my lids every once in awhile, so I know it&#x27;s not just me. (Not always anyway)</li>
    <li> I spent a long time trying to decide which thing to buy and reading multiple reviews. Thank you to all who took the time to share their thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;This curler is sturdy and works well and definitely worth spending the money.  Buying a cheap one is not saving money if you have to turn around and buy another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this curler!</li>
    <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve tried both  cheap and expensive eyelash curlers with inconsistent results; including pinched eyelids and chopped off eyelashes.  Admittedly operator error is part of it BUT this one makes for less errors lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my second Tweezerman Classic, its consistently best for my big, almond-shaped eyes just as suggested years ago. Now I have one for home and one for travel and plenty of refill pads.</li>
    <li> curler is not functioning well&lt;br /&gt;it cannot curl my lashes without doing any damages :(&lt;br /&gt;will return it for sure</li>
    <li> bought as a gift for my wife, she reports she is very happy with the curler.  well worth the money (specially if it keeps her happy), but also comes w a refill, which her old one didnt have.  to me, it seems like a good tool in its respective field of tools.</li>
    <li> 54 yo female using curlers for 40 years, best one I&#x27;ve ever used, it acturally fits your eye, you will not be dissappointed</li>
    <li> I surprised by the high ratings. I don&#x27;t think this product curls my lashes much at all. It seems a little squatty and doesn&#x27;t open very wide. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Loved them, have bought many other brands, much more EXPENSIVE and these by far are the BEST!! LOVE them!! GREAT!!</li>
    <li> the quality is fantastic and works well. there are also 3 extra exchange for that purple thing. I like it and use it everyday now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Asian. With that being said, most of the curlers on the market just don&#x27;t fit my eyes. I&#x27;ve used a few different brands, and none have achieved the result I wanted. Then I travelled to Asia, and found a good curler that fit my eyes really well, but it is way over-priced in the states, so I didn&#x27;t want to spend that much money on it. My Asian girl friends told me Tweezerman curler is worth a try. The price is right, so why not?!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to say that this curler fits my eyes really well, and delivers a very good result! I&#x27;d recommend it to Asian girls like me that struggle to find a good lash curler.</li>
    <li> My first Tweezerman curler met a tragic end at the hands of my dog, and I didn&#x27;t hesitate to buy a second one. I know curlers seem pretty much the same, but this one really has been my favorite.No pinched or pulled lashes. It came with a vial of replacement purple cushions that I&#x27;ll probably lose before I need them, but the thought was nice. :)</li>
    <li> I purchased this eyelash curler at my local drugstore. It is the same brand. It cut off a chunk of eyelashes in the middle of each eye. In all my years of using eyelash curlers this has never happened to me before. I think the new style pads grip them too tight and they break off. Be very careful when using this one.</li>
    <li> I needed to find a replacement for my Shu since you can&#x27;t purchase those in the US anymore...crazy right?!  This is a great replacment and cheaper to boot.  I would say it&#x27;s not quite as good as the Shu but close.  Good enough that I bought one for my makeup kit as well.</li>
    <li> This curler does the job and does it well. Doesn&#x27;t pull or yank on my eyelashes, the movement is good and feels like a solidly made item.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this product! I really does a fantastic job curling my lashes. Gives them a rounded and smooth look. Not squared at all.</li>
