      <li>Great product, works really well with my heating cap.</li>
      <li>Me being the cheapskate that I am and not wanting to buy more lotion, I started using this product.</li>
      <li>It works great.. much better than the lotions I used, which actually irritated my skin.</li>
      <li>I had no idea a warn or hot towel would net me shuch great results!</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s other ways to use it as well, you can heat it up on a stove with a pot full of water, is said to give great results that way as well!</li>
      <li>Fantastic product,</li>

      <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
      <li>I cannot use mineral oil products due to a skin sensitivity and honestly this stuff is just better.  </li>
      <li>I rarely write reviews, but I felt I really had to because I love this product so much.  </li>
      <li>This is a product worth trying.</li>
      <li>Your hair will come out lusterious and helps to prevent breakage and gives it just the right sheen.</li>
      <li>After trying so many natural hair care products and spending so much money over the past four years to achieve the perfect twist-out without success, I finally found a product that with continued use delivers the results that I have been trying to achieve.</li>
      <li>My mother was the first person to introduce it to me.</li>
      <li>But after the first time it made my hair feel silky aand manageable.</li>
      <li>But I did not use it as a hot oil treatment</li>
      <li>My hair is soft, shiny and frizz free.</li>
      <li>hot lol)(flattening caused breakage even with heat protector prevented my hair growth before).</li>
      <li>Once a week I use it as a hot oil treatment.</li>
      <li>I have been using Hot Six oil for years.</li>
      <li>This works great on my scalp, not so much on my hair, especially once my hair is dry...</li>
      <li>I did, and in the interest of healthy hair, will be sticking with it for the long haul.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m bi-racial and have very course, curly hair.</li>
      <li>I am caucasian, but have very curly and somewhat frizzy hair.</li>
      <li>I also use it after every wash by applying it from the ends to the roots and really try to massage it into my scalp after I&#x27;ve applied my leave-in conditioners.  </li>
      <li>A really gentle hair brush for the ends, never applying much force while brushing&lt;br</li>
      <li>the African hair oil leaves my hair feeling so smooth and hydrated.</li>
      <li>My hair feels soft and full and has a shine that it normally does not when curly</li>
      <li>I’ve used this in the past for my hair with great results (effectively moisturizes my double processed hair without being heavy or greasy, and is versatile as it can be used as a nail conditioner, etc.).  </li>
      <li>The scent is appropriate for male or female.</li>
      <li>My skin loves it, my hair loves it, though I didn&#x27;t particularly notice any faster hair growth.</li>
      <li>The results from using this product on my hair; natural sheen, moisture, softness, length and thickening.</li>
      <li>My hair was so silky and soft</li>
      <li>I have found placing 3 drops in my palm and then mixing with a dollop of conditioner to be very effective for my very thick, coarse, dry hair.</li>
      <li>buy mine from Sally&#x27;s (costs less there), but if you can&#x27;t find it near you, it&#x27;s definitely worth ordering off</li>
      <li>and she forgot an entire new bottle of this at my apartment.</li>
      <li>My roots really needed daily cleaning, yet the ends were thin, dry, split easily and just could not withstand this much abuse.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s highly nurturing long term, and makes them curl)&lt;br</li>
      <li>treatment regimen consists of&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) dry shampoo for the roots (I am still looking for a good natural variety, as the mass-market ones are packed with seriously bad chemicals, and cornstarch is too light for my dark hair)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I’d recently switched to pure coconut oil and while I thought my hair felt great, my hairdresser was disappointed in how dry she thought it had become.  </li>
      <li>it mustve grown at least 1 inch, so worth it!</li>
      <li>usually my hair gets so dry within 3 days of washing it but after using this my hair goes a week before becoming dry.</li>
      <li>I suggest that you pour a little out and heat it before applying as to not use too much.  </li>

<li> This oil is an everyday must in our household.</li>

<li> I started noticing after 1 month when i combed my hair while wet and saw it go past my shoulders bones!</li>
<li> I also will use it after I have styled to soften my curls and break up the stiff gel feeling.</li>
<li> lots of this oil at the ends (turns out, slightly oily hair does not look bad, oily roots combined with dry ends look bad - besides</li>
<li> Anyone with curly hair knows that it&#x27;s difficult to get our hair to shine, but this helps with that.  </li>

    <li> I mix this oil with my leave-in conditioner and also created a shea butter mixture using this oil for my twist-outs and the results are amazing. The results from using this product on my hair; natural sheen, moisture, softness, length and thickening. After trying so many natural hair care products and spending so much money over the past four years to achieve the perfect twist-out without success, I finally found a product that with continued use delivers the results that I have been trying to achieve. This is a product worth trying. Individual results may vary.</li>
    <li> Smells good, adds shine.</li>
    <li> Like the oil but a lot leaked out in transit.</li>
    <li> I bought this item 1 month ago and it gives great results!I&#x27;m dominican so my hair is half mixed, curly and a teeny bit rough not much, more curly, i also relax it. It was 5 bucks at my local sally&#x27;s, I noticed it had Castor oil in it so decided to give it a try. Everyday i&#x27;d put a dime sized drop in my hand and rubbed it through my hair, also to note i stopped doing rollers and flattening my hair just leave my hair alone natural(not hot lol)(flattening caused breakage even with heat protector prevented my hair growth before). And the day i was to wash my hair at the end of the week i&#x27;d put alot through my hair from the roots to the ends, and leave it in for 3 to 4 hours then wash it out. My hair was so silky and soft it smelled great. I started noticing after 1 month when i combed my hair while wet and saw it go past my shoulders bones! it mustve grown at least 1 inch, so worth it! It contains all kinds of hair growth oils and smells great i will continue to do this until my desired hair growth, fantastic! There&#x27;s other ways to use it as well, you can heat it up on a stove with a pot full of water, is said to give great results that way as well!</li>
    <li> Great product, works really well with my heating cap.</li>
    <li> Great product if used very, very sparingly as this really is actual oil. I have found placing 3 drops in my palm and then mixing with a dollop of conditioner to be very effective for my very thick, coarse, dry hair.</li>
    <li> Love the smell!! I have medium thick hair and it leaves my hair soft. My two friends end up buying it too...</li>
    <li> At first I was not sure about this product. But after the first time it made my hair feel silky aand manageable. I had no idea a warn or hot towel would net me shuch great results!</li>
    <li> i absolutely  love the this oil!!! i use it to make my Shea butter smell better. the African hair oil leaves my hair feeling so smooth and hydrated. it does a really good job with locking in moisture. usually my hair gets so dry within 3 days of washing it but after using this my hair goes a week before becoming dry. it also smell so good!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m bi-racial and have very course, curly hair. Keeping it moisturized can be a challenge. I read the Amazon reviews and purchased this product. Great move! It&#x27;s wonderful and smells great. I also like to put it on my skin when it&#x27;s really dry. Fab price for such a versatile item!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a white guy. I broke up with my girlfriend and she forgot an entire new bottle of this at my apartment. I have really naturally supple pale skin, but I started using Accutane a few months ago. I started to get really dry arms and face. When I ran out of the various lotions that the same ex-girlfriend left at my apartment, I came upon this product. I read the label and it says it can be used on skin as well as hair. Me being the cheapskate that I am and not wanting to buy more lotion, I started using this product. It works great.. much better than the lotions I used, which actually irritated my skin.</li>
    <li> This is a great stuff for a oil treatment but it is heavy so you need use only a little.  I suggest that you pour a little out and heat it before applying as to not use too much.  Your hair will come out lusterious and helps to prevent breakage and gives it just the right sheen.</li>
    <li> Yes! This oil is awesome. I have long, extreme combination hair which has been looking pretty bad until I&#x27;ve finally found out what do do with it. My roots really needed daily cleaning, yet the ends were thin, dry, split easily and just could not withstand this much abuse. Had to sacrifice either the roots or the ends, so my hair never looked good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The treatment regimen consists of&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) dry shampoo for the roots (I am still looking for a good natural variety, as the mass-market ones are packed with seriously bad chemicals, and cornstarch is too light for my dark hair)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) lots of this oil at the ends (turns out, slightly oily hair does not look bad, oily roots combined with dry ends look bad - besides, it&#x27;s highly nurturing long term, and makes them curl)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) a *cold* water rinse (closes the hair cuticles, making hair look healthy, and strengthens the roots, too)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) less shampoo (it does not really need to lather),&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) Trimming the ends often,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6) A really gentle hair brush for the ends, never applying much force while brushing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But mostly, the oil. Makes the world of a difference. Makes the hair visually thicker, waivier, healthier, improves volume. Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
    <li> Great price for this product.  I’ve used this in the past for my hair with great results (effectively moisturizes my double processed hair without being heavy or greasy, and is versatile as it can be used as a nail conditioner, etc.).  For some reason, I’d gotten away from it in recent years.  I’d recently switched to pure coconut oil and while I thought my hair felt great, my hairdresser was disappointed in how dry she thought it had become.  Recommended I with back to this ASAP. I did, and in the interest of healthy hair, will be sticking with it for the long haul.</li>
    <li> This oil is an everyday must in our household. Works great, and smells nice too. The scent is appropriate for male or female.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff. I am caucasian, but have very curly and somewhat frizzy hair. I use this product following shampooing, in lieu of conditioner. Once a week I use it as a hot oil treatment. In the winter, it keeps my hair shiny and moisturized. I also use it all over my body as an after-shower moisturizer. Works much better than lotion in my experience. I cannot use mineral oil products due to a skin sensitivity and honestly this stuff is just better.  Fantastic product, and it&#x27;s not tested on animals!</li>
    <li> Use this oil with hot oil treatments and at least 3x a week. Love the smell of this product.</li>
    <li> I have type 4a hair with low porosity, which means my hair and scalp are prone to dryness. This works great on my scalp, not so much on my hair, especially once my hair is dry...It just doesn&#x27;t want to absorb the product. If you have a hair type like mine and are looking for a hair moisturizer I would recommend a water based cream or lotion. HOWEVER I still enjoy this product because it smells great, and makes a good hot oil treatment AND you can use it on your entire body for moisture. I did replace the pour cap with a spray cap for easier application.</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews, but I felt I really had to because I love this product so much.  It is now the only thing I use for deep conditioning/hot oil treatments.  I also use it after every wash by applying it from the ends to the roots and really try to massage it into my scalp after I&#x27;ve applied my leave-in conditioners.  Anyone with curly hair knows that it&#x27;s difficult to get our hair to shine, but this helps with that.  My hair feels soft and full and has a shine that it normally does not when curly and it smells great.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over six months and there has definitely been an improvement in the look and feel of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, it&#x27;s also a great body oil.  So, if you buy it and decide it&#x27;s not for you (can&#x27;t see that happening), you can always use it for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy mine from Sally&#x27;s (costs less there), but if you can&#x27;t find it near you, it&#x27;s definitely worth ordering off amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record, I&#x27;m American Indian/Irish/Scottish, have thick, coarse hair and my hair type is 3b and 3c.</li>
    <li> I have 3A type hair that tends to be frizzy. This oil is great! I use about a nickel size amount mixed with my regular conditioner and leave it on my hair for the rest of my shower and rinse. My hair is soft, shiny and frizz free. I also will use it after I have styled to soften my curls and break up the stiff gel feeling. Great value, wonderful product!</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s mother loves this product, helps my daughter&#x27;s hair and keeps it moist.</li>
    <li> I have kinky hair, and my kinky hair dries out.&lt;br /&gt;This didn&#x27;t add moisture to my hair, but helps keep it in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it 5 years now.</li>
    <li> I have been using Hot Six oil for years. My mother was the first person to introduce it to me. I was experiencing breakage with my hair and after about two weeks of use, I notice my hair growing in like weeds and the breakage stopped.  I had to slow down on using it because it really keeps the hair moisturized and conditioned to the point where it can get too soft. I love how this oil is multi-use. It&#x27;s really great for skin also.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells amazing. I mix it with my conditioner and it smells even better! My skin loves it, my hair loves it, though I didn&#x27;t particularly notice any faster hair growth. But I did not use it as a hot oil treatment so that&#x27;s probably why. Either way, great buy!</li>
    <li> This is some amazing stuff! I use it daily</li>
</ol>
