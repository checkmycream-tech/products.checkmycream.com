      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a cream to improve the glow, texture, tone and help fine lines and hydration, give this a try</li>
      <li>My skin is smooth and revitalized looking.</li>
      <li>It is definitely a unique scent.  </li>
      <li>Really truly love this.</li>
      <li>Will be scouting out local TJMaxx&#x27;s for more!</li>
      <li>This moisturizer is rich but light and full of anti-oxidant and natural anti-aging ingredients.  </li>
      <li>I love the natural and nourishing ingredients in this moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>if it doesn&#x27;t change another thing its worth the price for that</li>
      <li>I love the all natural ingredients and will stick with it.</li>
      <li>It is absolutely worth the purchase.</li>
      <li>, It really works, I noticed improvement right away!</li>
      <li>Very nice texture,smells really good and hydrates very well,as far as the anti aging properties i don&#x27;t know yet,it&#x27;s only 2 and a half weeks i&#x27;m using it.</li>
      <li>read all her reviews from products she has used  (not a very happy person)  lol,  Tip for Anna, maybe go to the store and try what&#x27;s right for you?  </li>
      <li>The only downside is that I bought it for $12.99 at Marshalls and don&#x27;t want to pay more</li>
      <li>I used Decleor for years, starting in my 30&#x27;s and that radically changed my skin for the better.</li>
      <li>Thanks, Jeffrey James!</li>
      <li>and my skin feels different, more supple and brighter.</li>
      <li>I love the way it smooths onto your face and you feel moisturized all day long.</li>
      <li>The price was right and I needed a new night creme.</li>
      <li>Did not see much &amp;#34;hallelujah&amp;#34; in it.</li>
      <li>highly, highly recommend this creme for any woman who wants quality and value in one creme.</li>
      <li>I am glad to see it on Amazon at half the cost of the products website.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this for any skin type.</li>
      <li>The creme is super rich and a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>skin is glowing after using this creme in less than a week!&lt;br /&gt;The light cucumber smell is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>For the last two months I was fighting some cystic acne on and off, and this cream has definitely been helping the healing process move quickly.</li>
      <li>I only use this at night, and in the morning my skin looks lovely (although a little greasy and needing to be washed).</li>
      <li>The product arrived with kitchen clear wrap &amp;#34;sealing&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I was introduced to The Cream via a purchase at Marshall&#x27;s and was pleasantly surprised by its quality.</li>
      <li>So far so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive been using this cream for about 3 weeks...</li>
      <li>But this face cream is above and beyond in real results.</li>
      <li>I searched and searched for a product with all the natural ingredients I wanted.  </li>
      <li>This cream didn&#x27;t take long to really see a difference on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Smoother, softer and makes my skin glow!</li>
      <li>I barely had to do ANY touch-ups post picture taking.</li>
      <li>all I know is that it works very well with makeup, reduces flakiness around my nose, doesn&#x27;t make my face break out or look greasy, and actually makes me look younger (especially in close-up photos).  </li>
      <li>The only drawback i found is that it is a little shinny,not to much although</li>

<li> The only drawback i found is that it is a little shinny,not to much although</li>
<li> When I opened the jar, half of the contents seemed missing - or maybe it &amp;#34;shifted&amp;#34; due to the very &amp;#34;careful&amp;#34; handling - I don&#x27;t know, but due to how thick this cream is, to see a huge chunk of contents &amp;#34;missing&amp;#34; (a big hole in the contents) was very strange.</li>
<li> I know smell doesn&#x27;t really mean much</li>
<li> I have really dry skin</li>
<li> A little goes a long way, so depending upon how often it is used, a 2 ounce jar can last anywhere between 2-3 months.</li>
<li> I have super sensitive skin and usually have to buy really expensive</li>
<li> Obviously opened previously, proven when I looked at the jar.  </li>
<li> I mixed it half and half with my regular moisturizer, Eliz.</li>
<li> I am also using a retinol cream every other night for acne..</li>
<li> -- apparently other people have caught on, because I can&#x27;t find it in stock there anymore!</li>
<li> Seriously though, everyone I know is telling me I look younger.</li>
<li> Also, when it begins to soak in, I can feel it slightly lifting my skin.</li>
<li> Arden Green Tea Lavendar Honey Drops Body Cream to stretch it.</li>
<li> 47 and a few days ago someone thought I was in my 30&#x27;s.</li>
<li> No interior cap covering the product and dried product in the grooves of the screw on cap.  </li>
<li> The cream is very thick, so a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> Also the label was glued on the jar in a very crooked manner, so I even suspected that this product was fake.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t usually leave product reviews.</li>
<li> Seriously, I&#x27;m amazed at the results.</li>
<li> I received this one rather late, in a dirty wrinkled envelope, which already threw me off.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, I was allergic to the scent.  </li>
<li> Drying and smells terrible</li>

    <li> This is one of the best creams I have used. It visibly improved my skin in all aspects. I love the all natural ingredients and will stick with it. If you&#x27;re looking for a cream to improve the glow, texture, tone and help fine lines and hydration, give this a try, It really works, I noticed improvement right away! The cream is very thick, so a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Soooooooo good!  Keeps my skin looking amazing!</li>
    <li> I love love love this creme. I know smell doesn&#x27;t really mean much but it smells so good. The creme is super rich and a little goes a long way. I got my sister hooked on the stuff, too.</li>
    <li> I found this amazing gem at TJMaxx... I bought the toner and serum as well . I have really dry skin and I instantly felt the difference! This is the most amazing product I&#x27;ve ever used, honestly, and I&#x27;ve tried a ton! Will be scouting out local TJMaxx&#x27;s for more! I&#x27;m in for life!</li>
    <li> although i used tons of products for years to reverse aging, i noticed after a turned 40 there was no color in my cheeks anymore. well i found this product at tjmaxx and decided to give it a shot because of the low price.&lt;br /&gt;well to my amazement after a weeks i had rosy cheeks like a 20 yr old.&lt;br /&gt;even if it doesn&#x27;t change another thing its worth the price for that alone.&lt;br /&gt;the amazon price is the same so i purchased my 2nd jar here.</li>
    <li> I have super sensitive skin and usually have to buy really expensive cremes.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is glowing after using this creme in less than a week!&lt;br /&gt;The light cucumber smell is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;I highly, highly recommend this creme for any woman who wants quality and value in one creme.</li>
    <li> In a word, this product is superb. I was introduced to The Cream via a purchase at Marshall&#x27;s and was pleasantly surprised by its quality.

    <li> I just love this cream..have been using it for about a week and see great results...my skin is brighter, softer and wrinkles seem to have lessened dramatically..so glad I asked the sales rep at Marshalls which cream and eye gel she recommened...the scent it great too very natural..the ingredients are awsome...im 57 and so happy with this product!</li>
    <li> I received this one rather late, in a dirty wrinkled envelope, which already threw me off. When I opened the jar, half of the contents seemed missing - or maybe it &amp;#34;shifted&amp;#34; due to the very &amp;#34;careful&amp;#34; handling - I don&#x27;t know, but due to how thick this cream is, to see a huge chunk of contents &amp;#34;missing&amp;#34; (a big hole in the contents) was very strange. Also the label was glued on the jar in a very crooked manner, so I even suspected that this product was fake. Nevertheless, I tried it, used it for a bit. Did not see much &amp;#34;hallelujah&amp;#34; in it. Not going to buy again.</li>
    <li> so wonderful. no grease or residuals</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually leave product reviews. But this face cream is above and beyond in real results. I have been using it for two weeks and my skin feels different, more supple and brighter. I&#x27;m 33 and my skin is behaving like it did at about 25/26. I&#x27;m really impressed. Tip: Pair this cream with an exfoliating face wash or toner or scrub and a serum to help hold in the moisture. It&#x27;s really impressive. I&#x27;ve already received inquiries on what i&#x27;m using. Thanks, Jeffrey James! (I love The Glow serum and the eye gel too!)</li>
    <li> This creme is amazing. I used Decleor for years, starting in my 30&#x27;s and that radically changed my skin for the better. Eventually, however, I moved over to Avalon Organics Vitamin C cream, which is also great and a fraction of the price.  I happened on a jar of Jeffrey James 2 months ago at TJ Maxx and thought &#x27;what the heck, why not?&#x27;  The price was right and I needed a new night creme. Seriously, I&#x27;m amazed at the results. I&#x27;m 47 and a few days ago someone thought I was in my 30&#x27;s. Friends are telling me I look great and whatever I&#x27;m doing, keep doing it. I only had the beginning of lines around my eyes and now there is nothing. Also picked up the serum and am using that at night as well. Really truly love this. No fragrance, which is also a bonus.</li>
    <li> I love the way it smooths onto your face and you feel moisturized all day long. Great purchase, I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> So far so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive been using this cream for about 3 weeks... I took some pictures of myself and my dog, with my camera and tripod for some family I&#x27;m sending some pictures to. I was wearing makeup but I can honestly say my skin looked awesome in the photos, and I was outside in natural light. I barely had to do ANY touch-ups post picture taking. For the last two months I was fighting some cystic acne on and off, and this cream has definitely been helping the healing process move quickly. I only use this at night, and in the morning my skin looks lovely (although a little greasy and needing to be washed). The scent of this cream reminds me of seaweed and cucumbers which reminds me of sushi. I love sushi so it works for me. I am also using a retinol cream every other night for acne.. this cream works great and helps the peeling effect. I would highly recommend this for any skin type.</li>
    <li> The cream did nothing for my skin.  I did not see any difference in texture or appearance. Maybe someone else will&lt;br /&gt;have better results than I did.</li>
    <li> The product arrived with kitchen clear wrap &amp;#34;sealing&amp;#34; it.  Obviously opened previously, proven when I looked at the jar.  No interior cap covering the product and dried product in the grooves of the screw on cap.  I did not use the product, returned for refund.</li>
    <li> Liked the thickness of this cream and the feel on my face.  Unfortunately, I was allergic to the scent.  It is definitely a unique scent.  Smells like cucumbers to me.</li>
    <li> This cream didn&#x27;t take long to really see a difference on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Smoother, softer and makes my skin glow!</li>
    <li> Drying and smells terrible</li>
    <li> I saw this product on the Wendy Williams show she mentioned lots of stars use the product and gave it away to her audience.  I decided to purchase based on the fact that Alicia Keys was one of the stars and her skin is great.  I went to the Jeffery James site not knowing what to puchase I emailed the company and received a suggestion to purchase the exfoliant, cleaners and cream.  I took the advice and purchased, I am so glad I did!  I have been using this it for months.  I am glad to see it on Amazon at half the cost of the products website.  Just hope it is the authentic product so far so good.</li>
    <li> Yes! The creme arrived in a timely manner and has been an excellent product.</li>
    <li> I have tried a million face creams and none has ever stood out enough for me to want to bother seeking it out again.  I bought this brand at Marshalls, and have been using it for several years now.  I have no idea why it works so well, all I know is that it works very well with makeup, reduces flakiness around my nose, doesn&#x27;t make my face break out or look greasy, and actually makes me look younger (especially in close-up photos).  The only downside is that I bought it for $12.99 at Marshalls and don&#x27;t want to pay more -- apparently other people have caught on, because I can&#x27;t find it in stock there anymore!</li>
    <li> read all her reviews from products she has used  (not a very happy person)  lol,  Tip for Anna, maybe go to the store and try what&#x27;s right for you?  Beats downing everyone&#x27;s product!!!  I just got this today and love it!!</li>
    <li> I love the natural and nourishing ingredients in this moisturizer.  I searched and searched for a product with all the natural ingredients I wanted.  I wanted something that would feed my skin.  This moisturizer is rich but light and full of anti-oxidant and natural anti-aging ingredients.  Also, when it begins to soak in, I can feel it slightly lifting my skin.</li>
    <li> I had been using Retin-A every night for two years along with a regular moisturizer during the day. I saw this cream on sale at TJ Maxx and bought it because it sounded good and was a bargain. I mixed it half and half with my regular moisturizer, Eliz. Arden Green Tea Lavendar Honey Drops Body Cream to stretch it. I&#x27;ve had incredible results! I stopped using Retin-A and now use only this morning and night, along with a sunscreen during the day when I go out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, I was in a store checking out when the saleswoman asked me if I qualified for the senior discount, which is +55. I looked at her and laughed and said, \\&quot;I&#x27;m way over. I&#x27;m 71.\\&quot; She said, \\&quot;No way! I asked because I thought you were under 55.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I said, \\&quot;You&#x27;re exaggerating, right?\\&quot; She insisted that she thought I was much younger than 71. I told her I&#x27;d shop in her store more often just for the compliment. Seriously though, everyone I know is telling me I look younger. My skin is smooth and revitalized looking. I have to think it is the mixture of the products because I&#x27;ve been using the Arden without the results I&#x27;m getting now.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and excellent service!</li>
</ol>
