      <li>Banana Boat Ultramist Baby Tear Free Lotion SPF 50, 6-Ounces</li>
      <li>cheaper sunscreens (non tear free)</li>
      <li>i found another brand of spray was much better for adults-coppertone ultra in the blue bottles (espeically good for men with body hair</li>

      <li>I now have almost a full can (and a tube of the cream which ruined my baby son&#x27;s t-shirt) that I will not use again.</li>
      <li>it works, smells good, protects you from the sun and doesn&#x27;t burn your eyes then why carry two different types of sunscreen protection when just one will do the job for everyone?</li>
      <li>Yes, it is SPF 50, and waterproof, and her (redhead) fair skin did not burn at all - however, after taking the white cotton shirt and underpants</li>
      <li>So far this product has been effective and as advertised.  </li>
      <li>EXCELLENT   HEALTH CONCERN HIGH   OTHER CONCERNS contains vitamin A, spray</li>
      <li>EXCELLENT   UVA PROTECTION MODERATE   UVA/UVB BALANCE MODERATE   SUNSCREEN STABILITY</li>
      <li>arrived quickly and on time.</li>
      <li>No skin reactions despite the fact my daughter has super senstive skin.</li>
      <li>We purchased this to try because of the no tears formula and the fact that it quickly and evenly sprays onto your skin.</li>
      <li>I was very comfortable to spray this on my young child and it never bothered them.  </li>
      <li>Great coverage - even through a little one who sweats buckets.  </li>
      <li>I am so glad that I changed my daughter out of her church clothes and into old play clothes before using this product for the first time!</li>
      <li>Sensitive skin (good for baby &amp; adult) :&lt;</li>
      <li>is  Nature&#x27;s Gate Baby  (no chemicals, no essential oils, just mineral ingredients, good on  very  sensitive/ reactive skin)  </li>
      <li>The nice thing is that I can finally tan without burning!</li>
      <li>I actually hold the can at arm&#x27;s length and lightly mist it on top of my makeup.</li>
      <li>I can apply this stuff right on my face.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t bother sensitive skin (eczema).</li>
      <li>This product works exactly as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Managed to keep our 2 year old sunburn free for 2 weeks at the beach.  </li>

      <li>I go right down their faces with my hands top to bottom.</li>
      <li>It really</li>
      <li>she had been wearing out of the washing machine, after having gone through the wash; I noticed that they all have bright yellow staining, on every edge that would have rubbed her skin even slightly.</li>
      <li>my 18 month old out in  the hot sun, didn&#x27;t get burned at all</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this for everyone that is looking for a decent sunblock to keep from getting burned.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this.</li>
      <li>High taxed.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t aware of this until a relative told me.</li>
      <li>It sprays on some old as silk and is absorbed without a whole lot of effort like some other products of use.</li>
      <li>Our grandson has sensitive skin and several allergies and certain products that we would use on him would just cause stinging sensations on his skin.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t spray this directly on my kids</li>
      <li>My 4 year old and 2 year old</li>
      <li>I use it for the whole entire family!</li>
      <li>It is the only product that NEVER stings my eyes no matter how much I sweat or touch my face.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s also cheaper, spend the money on this for young children and save some money on sunscreen for adults.</li>
      <li>particular product is not on the recall list, but I don&#x27;t want to use it on a baby or myself, personally.</li>
      <li>I am very pale and burn easily.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry as fast as another product by banana boat.</li>
      <li>use it on my kids, especially on their faces, and so far have had NO crying or tears at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>A little more expensive than non tear free versions of sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
      <li>Not sure if this brand is better than any other</li>
      <li>a consumer comes into contact with a flame or spark prior to complete drying of the product on the skin, there is a potential for the product to ignite.\\</li>
      <li>We just have to be careful not to get it on the back of his hands or around his eyes, because that &amp;#34;no tears&amp;#34; thing isn&#x27;t really a thing.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t put your baby in direct sun for so long that he burns, comon sense...</li>

<li> Also, I might add, that I spray it on her while she stands in the bath tub, and then allow it to dry before getting her dressed, and when we came home that day the entire bath tub was stained yellow, and I had to use bleach to get it off.</li>
<li> /&gt;Otherwise, one application seems to last a long time, and keeps him from getting burnt.</li>
<li> The smell is not so clear, and a little oily than Water babies.</li>
<li> I have washed them a further twice, with stain removal spray applied, and while the staining has faded a little, she definitely can&#x27;t wear these clothes in public again.</li>
<li> therefore gentle enough even for babies but the execution of this bottle just sucks and the fact that it&#x27;s not fast drying/absorbing</li>
<li> She has incredibly short hair and pink skin, so in the summer she needs sunscreen.</li>
<li> We spent 4 hours on the beach and reapplied 4 times after the initial application 30 minutes before going out.</li>

    <li> SPRAY FORMAT  &#x3D;  BAD FOR LUNGS : you are breeding small drops of sunscreen and it cumulates in your lungs, not good...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a VERY BAD EXPERIENCE  with Baby Banana Boat 50 and  also with Laroche Posay Anthelios 50 FACE .&lt;br /&gt;Put it on my face and neck, I had a feelling of suffocation with red face.  Also had the worst almost instant headach. It is due to WATERPROOF and other chemicals in this cream.  It clogs your pores... Dangerous products,  I returnedboth of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did you tried it on yourself?  I did use Baby Banana Boat 50 for a year because I have sensitive pale skin. I had no skin problems, the sunscreen works, but I noticed serious breast pain- took me a while to make the link with the use of this product  - Danger: Oxybenzone &#x3D; hormone disruptor. -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also tried other suscreens for \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; and do not recomand so called  \\&quot;hypoalergenic\\&quot; sunscreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch for:  perfume/fragrance, hidden chemicals, hormones disruptors (oxybenzone  is in Banana Boat 50 for babies... dangerous)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nobody needs a 100 :  a protection  of  20 is fine and you can put some more if needed. You don&#x27;t put your baby in direct sun for so long that he burns, comon sense...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;++++  Sensitive skin (good for baby &amp; adult) :&lt;br /&gt;my best pick  is  Nature&#x27;s Gate Baby  (no chemicals, no essential oils, just mineral ingredients, good on  very  sensitive/ reactive skin)  ++++ AVOID Waterproof it clogs the pores ++++</li>
    <li> Works great, no stinging eyes for the kids. Very fine mist that does not cake or run. Relatively water resistant.</li>
    <li> i used this sunscreen for my child.  it does not smell and does not feel like you are spraying a can of hairspray (so you don&#x27;t feeling like you are choking).  I was very comfortable to spray this on my young child and it never bothered them.  you do need to rub it in.  we do not use on the face, but on all other body parts including neck.  the product lasted awhile and coverage did not diminish when swimming &amp; toweling off.    i found another brand of spray was much better for adults-coppertone ultra in the blue bottles (espeically good for men with body hair becuase you don&#x27;t need to rub it in).  it&#x27;s also cheaper, spend the money on this for young children and save some money on sunscreen for adults.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t even have children, but I have hyper-sensitive and insanely dry skin. I am very pale and burn easily. I actually hold the can at arm&#x27;s length and lightly mist it on top of my makeup. When I do this, my skin stays hydrated all day and does not break out either, which a lot of sunscreens do to me.  I have a terrible problem with peeling skin around my mouth and nose and have tried everything on the market to address that problem. When I use this, the peeling is minimal. This might not work for anyone with an oily skin problem, but if you&#x27;re dry and need a lot of protection, this is the way to go. It can make my eyeshadow crease a bit, but that&#x27;s the only issue I have with it.</li>
    <li> OVERALL SCORE 7  UVB PROTECTION (SPF) EXCELLENT   UVA PROTECTION MODERATE   UVA/UVB BALANCE MODERATE   SUNSCREEN STABILITY EXCELLENT   HEALTH CONCERN HIGH   OTHER CONCERNS contains vitamin A, spray</li>
    <li> Works fine. Perfect for my little one.</li>
    <li> I can slather this stuff on my kid&#x27;s face and even over their eyes with no burn.  I go right down their faces with my hands top to bottom. NOTE: I use the lotion and not the spray. I have tried everything else.  My kid&#x27;s have never burned even in the hot sun in Palm Springs.  Highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Have seen banana boat in the stores, trust the name and the quantity is good. Excellent price point. We keep them in all multiple locations to make sure we never are unprotected from the sun.</li>
    <li> I am so glad that I changed my daughter out of her church clothes and into old play clothes before using this product for the first time! Yes, it is SPF 50, and waterproof, and her (redhead) fair skin did not burn at all - however, after taking the white cotton shirt and underpants she had been wearing out of the washing machine, after having gone through the wash; I noticed that they all have bright yellow staining, on every edge that would have rubbed her skin even slightly. I have washed them a further twice, with stain removal spray applied, and while the staining has faded a little, she definitely can&#x27;t wear these clothes in public again. Also, I might add, that I spray it on her while she stands in the bath tub, and then allow it to dry before getting her dressed, and when we came home that day the entire bath tub was stained yellow, and I had to use bleach to get it off. SO thankful that it was my tub and not my carpets that got it! On close inspection, the can does say, \\&quot;May stain some fabrics\\&quot; in the small print, but this is ridiculous! I now have almost a full can (and a tube of the cream which ruined my baby son&#x27;s t-shirt) that I will not use again. Blatant waste of money. I will stick with the Coppertone spray I had used previously as it has never done this with us, despite, interestingly enough, reviews that it does. What is IN these sunblocks??</li>
    <li> We apply this to our toddler before each vacation day. We just have to be careful not to get it on the back of his hands or around his eyes, because that &amp;#34;no tears&amp;#34; thing isn&#x27;t really a thing. If he gets it in his eyes, it&#x27;s a disaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, one application seems to last a long time, and keeps him from getting burnt.</li>
    <li> Works great!!!!!  The mist is so fine that you don&#x27;t even feel it!</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t bother sensitive skin (eczema).</li>
    <li> This product works exactly as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my kids, especially on their faces, and so far have had NO crying or tears at all.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t spray this directly on my kids faces (I spray it on my hands, then rub it on their faces).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also recommend putting this on their arms and hands so that when they wipe their faces, they don&#x27;t get tears.&lt;br /&gt;The cheaper sunscreens (non tear free) we use on the body and legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve even started using it for myself for when I&#x27;m swimming in the ocean and surfing. Nothing like burning sunscreen in the eyes to make you miss seeing waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;1. Tear free! It really works.&lt;br /&gt;2. Because it works, you will put more sunscreen on your kids and your own face without fear of stinging and burning.&lt;br /&gt;3. Bottle design makes it easy to get every last drop of sunscreen out of it.&lt;br /&gt;4. Feels really cold when it sprays on (my kids laugh and giggle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. A little more expensive than non tear free versions of sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;2. Sand will stick to it (just like almost every other sunscreen made).</li>
    <li> Great coverage - even through a little one who sweats buckets.  Never causes skin irritation.</li>
    <li> So I actually got this to use on my dog, since it doesn&#x27;t have any zinc in it (if dogs lick that off themselves they can get dangerously anemic). She doesn&#x27;t like being sprayed in the face with it, but it works! She has incredibly short hair and pink skin, so in the summer she needs sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Nobody likes putting lotion on children. This spray makes it a lot easier and without the harmful chemical Oxybenzone that so many lotion makers use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray could be a bit stronger, otherwise it is perfect.</li>
    <li> This works great, it doesn&#x27;t burn our eyes when we spray it on our faces. My 4 year old and 2 year old even let me spray it on their faces.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Only sunscreen that works on our very pale and sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Spray suntan lotion is a godsend for a parent with small kids.  My kid would not sit still for the cream lotion.  A few seconds and we&#x27;re all done and protected.</li>
    <li> Not as good as i thought before I bought it. The smell is not so clear, and a little oily than Water babies. easily be taxed by China Customer and the taxed is more than 12 dollar. High taxed. Not recommend.</li>
    <li> love that it sprays and my babies never have any skin irritations.</li>
    <li> This sunblock is by far the best product on the market for the entire family that I&#x27;ve ever used! This is better than Coppertone, and is suitable for my one-year-old all the way up to my 83-year-old dad. I love the protection that this provides, and the functionality was on my expectations. It sprays on some old as silk and is absorbed without a whole lot of effort like some other products of use. It&#x27;s not overwhelming, smells great, looks great on different complexions, and does what it says it&#x27;s going to do in a wonderful way. I highly recommend this for everyone that is looking for a decent sunblock to keep from getting burned.</li>
    <li> So far this product has been effective and as advertised.  No skin reactions despite the fact my daughter has super senstive skin.</li>
    <li> I can ride my waverunner or boat all day without burning. I am blonde, fair-skinned and usually burn within 15 minutes. The nice thing is that I can finally tan without burning! I apply this on my face and it never burns my eyes.</li>
    <li> Banana Boat Ultramist Baby Tear Free Lotion SPF 50, 6-Ounces (Pack of 3)&lt;br /&gt;Will be great for our upcoming cruise! Good stuff!</li>
    <li> Great sunblock.  Used all Summer on young children and elderly folks (and those in-between) with very fair skin, and no burns! :-)</li>
    <li> I just love this product.  It sprays on great and does not iritate eyes.  I use it for the whole entire family!</li>
    <li> Yesterday, there were four reports of people catching on fire from the Ultramist products. I wanted to post this in case anyone reads this. Please research this on the internet before you buy this or any Bananaboat Ultramist product. Unfortunately I can&#x27;t post a link here. This has been recalled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;If a consumer comes into contact with a flame or spark prior to complete drying of the product on the skin, there is a potential for the product to ignite.\\&quot; This was stated by the manufacturer. 30 products have been recalled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular product is not on the recall list, but I don&#x27;t want to use it on a baby or myself, personally. It&#x27;s an spf 50 Ultramist product, which were the ones that had the flamability problem.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t spray well when you hold it upside down when applying on legs.  It doesn&#x27;t dry as fast as another product by banana boat. The pros though is it&#x27;s mineral base and safe on kids. It also doesn&#x27;t feel sticky. I usually will spread it all over after spraying as it doesn&#x27;t come out even.  I love that it&#x27;s mineral base and therefore gentle enough even for babies but the execution of this bottle just sucks and the fact that it&#x27;s not fast drying/absorbing means you end up having to use your hands so I probably won&#x27;t repurchase but if you have kids this is a great option.</li>
    <li> Managed to keep our 2 year old sunburn free for 2 weeks at the beach.  Not much else to say about it</li>
    <li> While I prefer to use Babyganics lotion for my son, he typically only sits still for me to apply it in the morning before leaving the house.  Once at the pool or the park he doesn&#x27;t want to bother with sitting still for me to reapply more sunscreen.  This is perfect to get him on the go.  I still use the Babyganics for his face, but this is great for the rest of his body!</li>
    <li> This product left a residue of a different color on our clothes once we washed them in a machine.&lt;br /&gt;The clothes were ruined. I wasn&#x27;t aware of this until a relative told me. Too late. I had already used it.</li>
    <li> We bought this because it was less expensive than the normal baby brand we use and we are paying for it. We spent 4 hours on the beach and reapplied 4 times after the initial application 30 minutes before going out. My husband, myself and my 2 year old look like lobsters and are miserable. I don&#x27;t know if we got a bad batch, or what, but we won&#x27;t ever chance it again?</li>
    <li> arrived quickly and on time. three pack it was good worked in las vegas for me and my 18 month old out in  the hot sun, didn&#x27;t get burned at all</li>
    <li> Spray button was damaged, an expensive bottle of nothing, and I had no sunscreen.</li>
    <li> This keeps our daughter, as well as all the other kids who use our pool, well protected from harmful rays on those beautiful sunny days and at a great price using Subscribe and Save from Amazon!</li>
    <li> I can apply this stuff right on my face. It is the only product that NEVER stings my eyes no matter how much I sweat or touch my face.</li>
    <li> Not sure if this brand is better than any other but it does the job!</li>
    <li> works great as intended</li>
    <li> Our grandson has sensitive skin and several allergies and certain products that we would use on him would just cause stinging sensations on his skin. We purchased this to try because of the no tears formula and the fact that it quickly and evenly sprays onto your skin. It works extremely well on him and lets him be outside without getting burned while playing sports.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all just started using it because it is easy to put on and will provide a SPF 50 protection and now when we all watch his outdoor sporting events we care protected from getting burned up by the sun. This hypoallergenic formula provides excellent protection and it is waterproof for up to 80 minutes. What is so neat about it is that you can just spray it on without having to rub it all over yourself or someone else. We do spray our hands to put it onto our faces and ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it works, smells good, protects you from the sun and doesn&#x27;t burn your eyes then why carry two different types of sunscreen protection when just one will do the job for everyone? This is a very good product and I recommend it to you. It works great for us!</li>
