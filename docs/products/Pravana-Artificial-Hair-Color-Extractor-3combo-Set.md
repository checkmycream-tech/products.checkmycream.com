      <li>I Love this Product!!&lt;br /&gt;Despues</li>
      <li>I will tell you when applying this wrapping your hair in some sort of plastic (i used a plastic jewel bag) and applying heat with a blow dryer for 20min is CRUCIAL in getting the best results.</li>
      <li>it was shiny and healthy still :)</li>
      <li>This is a wonderful product and I will keep it for future correction of permanent or semi permanent color mistakes.</li>

      <li>I was amazed how light it became.</li>
      <li>BUT if you are trying to remove oxidized color (color that uses developer) this is extremely effective and gentle.  </li>
      <li>I was so happy to find this product and to see my daughters shiny hair back!</li>
      <li>My advice, pick a color that is lighter than what you&#x27;re comfortable with because your hair will suck it right up!  </li>
      <li>This is a fabulous product and so much better than just bleaching, you just need the right training and or some common sense (like reading the directions) to get the best results.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t expected much of this product at first. I bought it originally to use on my hair but I found a way not to need it for that. At first I was disappointed because it&#x27;s so expensive but then I used it to get hair dye out of a piece of clothing I dyed by accident but couldn&#x27;t bleach. It took the dye out of it flawlessly, not a single residual stain in sight. My bet is it works great on hair too!</li>
    <li> I never leave feedback on anything but legit, this is the BEST colour stripper EVER!!!!!!! I have been dying my hair jet black for 10 years now (boxed dye) and with one application with this stuff my hair is almost it&#x27;s natural colour again! I was amazed at how light my hair got with the one application! Definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> This stuff works and the bottles are really big.</li>
    <li> Love it, it removed decades of very dark hair color, It did leave an smell that took a few weeks to lessen. The color of my hair turn a beautiful burnt orange color, I added blond hi lite, it was amazing.</li>
    <li> My daughter dyed her hair permanent black with purple highlights. I then convinced her to stick with semi-permanent colors for a while. Needless to say it wasn&#x27;t long before she was sick of black. WE tried everything on the market to remove the color, we used bleach and 3 other products that promised to remove all haircolor. Nothing worked! The only result was splotchy color where the black was lightened in some areas and color bleached from her roots. It was a nightmare! I finally read on a professional haircare website that Pravana was the best color remover on the market and was gentle on hair. It sounded too good to be true after all we went through. WE followed the directions exactly (you must be careful that the final rinse lasts for a full 5 minutes to make sure you rinse out all of the color moleclues), and were shocked to see her natural level of color back. You do have to be ready to process it with the color you want to use because the product that was used will only be lifted but any developer or bleach that was used in processing your hair the first time will still be present. Once you get to the level you are happy with after the Pravana you can then immediately process your hair to the correct color you desire. Beware though the hair shaft will be porous so Pravana reccomends that in selecting your new color you may want to pick one a little lighter than you actually want. I was so happy to find this product and to see my daughters shiny hair back!</li>
    <li> I have been coloring my hair since I was 16, but I still have the occasional mishap. I don&#x27;t go to a salon becuase the amount of grays I have to cover would make it too expensive.  So, my hair is porous. and I accidently went too dark during an attempt at an \\&quot;all over\\&quot; color (normally it&#x27;s just the roots). The results were almost black hair around the crown and dark brown reddish undertones at the ends. I wasn&#x27;t a total racoon, but it looked like a big mistake. I tried using a 40 processor the next time to \\&quot;lift\\&quot; it, but it didn&#x27;t work.  Then I found this product, and I spent a lot of time making sure I could use it at home.  It definitely works. It&#x27;s a little smelly, but if you wash your hair afterwards properly with the clarifying shampoo, the smell will go away.  The best thing is that it won&#x27;t irritate your scalp like bleach or ammonia. You are still chemically treating your hair, but it&#x27;s not as severe as bleaching. If you hair is very dark, and you are trying to go much lighter, you will need a few processes. I just needed some corrective lift, and then I recolored my hair the proper color right after. I would suggest that you go at LEAST a shade lighter (if not 2) when choosing the color.  Also, the clarifying shampoo kind of messes with your hair, so it will look like a lot if falling out during the process (and it probably is; it&#x27;s hard to get a comb through hair after clarifying shampoo).  All in all, follow the directions exactly, use a bowl/brush/gloves (and if you have long hair like me, maybe a friend).  I had a very positive experience with this product.  This is the only review I have on Amazon, but I had such a positive experience (and SAVED SO MUCH MONEY) that I had to post.</li>
    <li> Makes your hair so porous that your hair will no longer retain any more hair color.  I&#x27;ve tried redying my hair months later and all the dye washes out within a week.</li>
    <li> The product works well! My wife gives it 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I have been dying my hair for the past 30 years due to gray hair at an early age. I used this product exactly as described  three times over the course of two weeks and the results are amazing. The first time my hair turned a brownish red from  a very dark brown. I really liked the way it looked and my gray roots blended well so I waited a week for the next dose. Again I followed the directions exactly and ended up with more red than brown, but I still liked this so I left it for another week. The third and final time the color was all red, and somewhat blended with the gray but with my black eyebrows it looked silly to have such light hair so I dyed my hair immediately after. I went with a brown seven dye as I normally use a 5 and my hair did turn darker that I would have liked but still a nice brown. I used a heavy conditioner after each color extraction and my hair has stayed nice and soft. In fact my hair feels lighter after the dyes have been extracted and looks so much more full and healthy. As other reviewers have noted this does gave that rotten sulfur smell which can last a while, but I feel it was worth it to extract the dye from my hair. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to remove hair dye. My only regret is that I did not know about this product when it was turned black by a stylist who insisted it really was brown and not black (it matched my dogs black fur perfectly).. It took me over a year to try and undo her mistake.&lt;br /&gt;Just remember to follow all the directions exactly as stated. I used a plastic cap and a hair dryer. I also used a timer so I would know if I had rinsed long enough. Always use a deep conditioner after using.</li>
    <li> Got jet black hair dye out of my hair.</li>
    <li> This is not a semi permanent color. Its works like a permanent color and has damaged my hair!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Two thumbs down!!!! I hate it. Very misleading</li>
    <li> Does NOT remove Pravana Chromasilk Vivids (or henna, which apparently Vivids is). You would think this would remove their own product?! And after looking at the instructions, the process is lengthy and requires several attempts. You are better off just bleaching your hair out, unless it is henna or vivids and you cannot. What a waste of money!</li>
    <li> I have been a stylist since 1980 and have never had a haircolor mishap so I was due. I have a client that has been a very light blond for many years and decided to go to a medium blond however I received some really bad advise from Matrix and she ended up with 3\\&quot; copper roots and 6\\&quot; ash ends. I researched color removal products and found this one and tried it. It took only one time and 20 minutes to achive the most amazing results! This product needs to be applied quickly and evenly for best results. Should be used by professionals ONLY!!!</li>
    <li> I Love this Product!!&lt;br /&gt;Despues d tener el Cabello Teñido Red.. Pense q nada me ayudaria a sacarlo y Menos sin dañarlo.. Oh Sorpresa!! Me encontre PRAVANA ARTIFICIAL HAIR COLOR EXTRACTOR y Funciono! Lo mejor es q No me dañó el Cabello!! XD</li>
    <li> The product states clearly that it is not for re-sale. Thus, this seller is illegally re-selling the product.y  Additionally, the seller in no way made clear that this product required various additional items to be usable. Namely, you need gloves, a hair dye brush applicator, a mixing bowl, and developer in order to use the product.    As for the actual product - I found it to be rather effective in removing a black hair dye. The product makes clear that it cannot remove certain reds - pay attention to this, it&#x27;s accurate. My natural color is a dark brown, but as I have used red dye in the past, I could not \\&quot;get back\\&quot; to my natural color. Again, this isn&#x27;t a complaint as I was well aware prior to purchase of this possibility. That said, after following the directions to the letter, I was pleasantly surprised that I was left with an extremely even and shiny color. I didn&#x27;t even need to re-dye my hair after use. Given that my hair has been about 20 different colors over the past five years (from purple and pink, green and blue, black, red, etc.), I expected to be left with a mop of crazily colored hair. So, I was really, really pleased. Also, the condition of my hair is excellent after use - no breakage, no patches of color, and a wonderful shine.     Overall, I think this seller should be avoided, it was clear that my items had been opened (there was product spilled down the sides of the bottles); the product is being illegally re-sold, and IT TOOK FOREVER to arrive. Do not expect quick shipping from this seller. Overall, good product, crappy seller.    Be aware that this product is for professionals only.</li>
    <li> I did not purchase this product from Amazon but I wanted to let potential customers here know that if you have a Sodium Hydroxide (lye) relaxer you cannot use this product. I did my research and it was not until I received this product does the instructions state this. I called Pravana and they stated that it would make the hair break off.... I don&#x27;t know about anyone else but I just lost a major amount of hair in 2013 and my hair is finally back ...not willing to take that loss again!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this !!!!! So I had blue/brown hair on the bottom and decided to bleach it and some pieces came out a teal/green color while others came out a beautiful pale yellow so I decided to buy this to take it out because my hair couldn&#x27;t take anymore bleach &amp; it did wonders !!!! The green color was out and became a beautiful pale yellow ♡ just make sure you wash it all out or else the color won&#x27;t come out. Only downside is it smells horrible because of the sulfur but it&#x27;s worth having to smell that for a short time to get the beautiful hair you want lol</li>
    <li> The product seemed to work great! And then it was as if I never used it at all. I&#x27;m going to chalk that up to probable misuse on my part but either way thats crazy to have a product like this be able to be undone by god only knows what.</li>
    <li> I did not read the online description thoroughly.  I was trying to remove temporary hair color. So no it did not work for that. BUT if you are trying to remove oxidized color (color that uses developer) this is extremely effective and gentle.  Your hair will not go back to its natural color. Your original hair color will always be lightened by the peroxide even if you have colored your hair a darker shade. This is a wonderful product and I will keep it for future correction of permanent or semi permanent color mistakes.</li>
    <li> I had red hair since February this year. This product did the job for me.  It removed the red color without damaging my hair.  I will recommend this to anyone.  I also gave this to my cousin and it works for her as well.</li>
    <li> I had tried a new hair color and instead of the level I was used to getting this was 2 shades darker then any other brand I have tried, so I tried this Pravana 3 step color remover and within 3 minutes of applying it, I looked in the mirror at the top of my hair and noticed it was turning orange, so I hurried to rinse it out and I ended up with orange hair.  Please do not try this product, not only did it strip out all the color it ruined my hair, my roots are still pulling this orange color through my hair.  Terrible stuff!</li>
    <li> I am a cosmetology student with boxed black hair and I brought this product into school to see how it would work.  I had a student and instructor apply it, we followed all of the directions.  We applied it an inch away from my scalp.  My hair is still black, but the ends were the only part to lighten.  The only good thing about this product is it didn&#x27;t damage my hair.  The bad-- it&#x27;s a long and annoying process,  my scalp was so itchy and dry the next couple of days (and we didn&#x27;t even apply it directly to it), and it smells TERRIBLE! It stunk up the salon like rotten eggs when I was sitting under the dryer, and even after washing it for the next few weeks it&#x27;s stunk.  My boyfriend came home and I was taking a nap and he said all he could smell was rotten eggs!! I would have done a second application of this product which I probably needed to really lift my color but the hassle and smell are too much to bear.  I basically just threw away $40.</li>
    <li> Read the instructions, follow them exactly and you&#x27;ll succeed at removing permanent color from your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it says, if you have used a semi or demi permanent then it will not remove the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had started dying my hair when I was around 14 from a dark blonde (7) to a dark brown, to purple, to red, to dark brown again. I&#x27;m now 25 and my hair ended up being a dark auburn color. This product lifted the color to dark blonde with some copper tint still present. As red is one of the hardest colors to remove, I was amazed. If you&#x27;re removing red then it might take quite a few washes, I still have enough product left for a couple more uses. If you&#x27;re removing anything without red then this will easily take you back to your natural color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very healthy hair and it didn&#x27;t damage it at all. I didn&#x27;t have to trim my hair, it&#x27;s still soft, long, silky and perfect!</li>
    <li> Do not use on extreme colors.... it doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
    <li> Took out the black in my hair and turned it to&lt;br /&gt;Brown and it did not damage it at all.. I was previously blonde but I messed up with my mixture and so my hair turned black. I didn&#x27;t want that. When I used this product I didn&#x27;t think it was going to work but it did. Although it only works with one application it saved me from killing my hair by trying to bleach the black out. I recommend!!</li>
    <li> Works like it says and very fast shipping!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a hair stylist for 28 years and have never used a product that worked so well to remove color!  It is amazing!  I had to remove black hair color from my client and on the first try it was a success.  I&#x27;ll never use anything else.  The hair was in OK condition after the treatment, but I&#x27;m sure with proper conditioning and care, it will be good as new.</li>
    <li> So i died my hair a really dark brown red, but before my hair was dark it was a white blonde, I&#x27;m now missing my white blonde hair so I knew i had to strip my hair color out before I go back...i.heard of this product and I am amazed of how much this stuff took out! awggg it is left with a red color, i look like a strawberry blonde. This stuff is seriously magic, also after i blow dried my hair it was shiny and healthy still :)</li>
    <li> Absolutely worth EVERY PENNY!!!</li>
    <li> Well it did not take out all my black dye I&#x27;m afraid. I followed the instructions to a T. My hair is to my waist and I&#x27;ve been dying it black for 8 years, box dye. I got it to a blackish red and had to hit the hairstylist. It does smell but no worse than the chemicals you find at the salon.</li>
    <li> Been dying my hair black for YEARS!  It is taking several attempts to get all the black out, but it is working.  I have no doubt this would remove most color immediately.  I have literally been dying my hair black since I was 16 and I am 32 now so the fact that it is taking it off at all is very impressive.  Just be patient - IT WORKS!  Also - I have done two treatments to my hair so far and it hasn&#x27;t damaged it at all.  I am down about 3 levels from black in two applications so I think the third one will do the trick and get it out out :)</li>
    <li> The product does its job. It stinks really bad like rotten eggs/sulfate. Just make sure you wash the product out completely or it will oxidize and go back to your previously dyed color.  I washed my hair 3 times and then deep conditioned it, it worked great. My only concern is, the packaging was extremely damaged(opened too)... I was surprised the product made it to my door</li>
    <li> I liked this product at first, but I started noticing the black I&#x27;d originally had in my had started slowly coming back.</li>
    <li> This product definitely does what it is supposed to do. But after 3 sessions in 1 day, I still had too much black in my hair. :/</li>
    <li> Great product and shipped quickly. Is easy to use even for those without professional cosmetology experience. A much safer alternative to bleach.</li>
    <li> Does what it says it does. Worth the price, not nearly as damaging as bleach or other color removers. My salon starts at $80 for this service using exactly the same products. Get someone to help you do this to your hair and you will have excellent results! I stripped black out of my hair, and it worked like a charm.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to remove black dye from my hair.  I also had purple bangs, but I was unsure of how it would work on them.  I&#x27;d gone black in the past and had it removed with bleach and I was positive I did not want to go that route again!  So my hairdresser used the Pravana on all of my hair.  We had to do 2 sessions of it as the ends didn&#x27;t remove completely, but it did the job!  The bangs were still purple, though much lighter, and the rest of my hair was a very light red.  It looked natural and I would have just kept it at that color but I still had the purple bangs.  My hair wasn&#x27;t fried at all!  It still felt great.  My only problem came when we applied the new color.  I had got a light reddish brown to go over it and my hair totally absorbed it and it LOOKED BLACK again!  RAH!  Not Pravana&#x27;s fault obviously, but this goes to show that when they say you need to select a color 2 shades lighter than what you&#x27;re going for they mean it!  I should have picked something even lighter but I was afraid of it being too light.  My advice, pick a color that is lighter than what you&#x27;re comfortable with because your hair will suck it right up!  If it&#x27;s not what you want, wait a few weeks and dye it again.  Seems like a lot of processing, but MUCH better than bleaching!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about Pravana and the product line .... a MUST have if you frequently change your hair like I do</li>
    <li> I started with dark brown hair (box dye) and followed the directions word for word, my hair is now orange. Back to dark I go.</li>
    <li> This product worked great! I was afraid of the &amp;#34;horrible smell&amp;#34; after reading other reviews, but there was none. Perhaps mine was a different formulation than previously used, but it didn&#x27;t have a really strong smell. I followed the directions and got my natural hair color back with one use. I have been dyeing my strawberry blonde hair dark brown and then dark red for a long time, years, and this took it all out after one use, I was really surprised.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a stylist and LOVE this product. It&#x27;s strips all artificial color from hair without the damage of lightener! It does smell terrible but it&#x27;s totally worth it! Its perfect for me because I&#x27;m always wanting to change my color. HIGHLY recommend.</li>
    <li> I have used this product twice and I haven&#x27;t had a problem with it. My hair was black and purple and it has taken me two sets of this to get it to red with all the purple gone. The smell isn&#x27;t very appealing but it works. However, when I bought this, the receipt said it comes with aprons, hair caps, and rubber gloves. Not all the items listed was in the box. Sloppy packaging and service for such an expensive product.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all and smells extremely terrible...please I beg you do not waste your money..this stuff ruined my hair and I had to cut it extremely short..and it wouldn&#x27;t take color anymore for months after</li>
    <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing. I am a latina woman with naturally curly/ethnic hair (I&#x27;m half Dominican). My natural hair color is a dark brown almost black. I originally bleached my hair to put highlights and it looked horrid/brassy so I colored it a dark red/auburn color. I dyed my hair that red color for a good year and a half every 6-8 weeks before I decided to test out Pravana Chroma Vivids Violet. My hair was purple for a few months and then I got bored and dyed my hair blue black. I kept up the blue black for another 6 months before deciding I wanted to go light again. I had no idea how I would get the residual dye out of my hair but knew I adored Pravana products. I decided to test this out! It smells like rotten eggs but it is easy to use. The three part system is very easy to navigate and I actually enjoy the sulfate free cleansing shampoo included. You can probably get a good 3-4 uses out of the bottles for fine/normal bra strap length hair. The key is to use a wide tooth comb to distribute the product through your hair instead of adding more and more product. After ONE use all of the black and purple was gone and I was left with a gorgeous auburn/light brown base color and a golden blonde on the areas I previously bleached. It looked so good but I did try to put an ash blonde in my hair and it actually turned my hair darker due to it being so porous. The directions do tell you that if you plan to dye your hair after using the extractor to go two shades lighter than you want because it will go darker than expected - they weren&#x27;t lying! I put the lightest blonde I could find to tone the color and it turned a darker brown! I didn&#x27;t like it so a few weeks later I re-did the color extractor and  voila, gorgeous color! My hair doesn&#x27;t feel stripped or fried. If you can get past the smell you will be pleased with your results! If you frequently change your hair color you must keep this on hand for those oops moments or easy changes. This can get out ANYTHING!</li>
    <li> Did a wonderful job taking the black out of my hair. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have been a level 1 black for two years and want to go blonde. If you follow the instructions and take your time, you can pull any and all color from your hair safely. No frizzy dried or damaged hair afterwards. Had to use multiple times because of how many times my hair has been dyed.</li>
    <li> bought this to remove the red and black from my hair. it removed the red completely and some of the black.... its now a dark brown color that I still can&#x27;t dye over but that is better than black!!! You might want to buy 2 bottles if you have long hair (mine is to the middle of my back) definitely could have used a second bottle!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this and would recommend it. I purchased after being tired of my hair so dark over the last 3 years  I am auburn naturally, so I decided to try this because the salon was going to be over $300 to strip and it was going to be bleached. I did it 3 times and it was fabulous! so HAPPY to be rid of this DARK black hair!! my hair was auburn (and gray lol) after the stripping . I then colored again with my desired color....auburn. thank you so much for a wonderful product that is affordable. just follow the directions to a t and you will be fine  I bought an attachment for my blow dryer at sally beauty supply for $9 so I could have the heat as it is advised on the instructions  I will recommend this and use again if needed</li>
    <li> If you have black or brown hair it will leave it orangy and it smells terrible I almost threw up a couple of times in order to work you have to blow dry</li>
    <li> Was super gentle on my hair which is all I really cared about it, it got the color out well but the color came back a few times - they say it has to do with rinsing well but I feel like I did that.</li>
    <li> I used it the other day and it turned most of my hair BLACK! My hair was dyed brown from an ombre I had. I decided after a long time to color my whole head a wine red. So, I bleached my hair with olaplex and used a color mixture of red and violet. When I wanted to refresh my color, I used too much violet and it became super dark. I was given the extractor so I can try it out. The top half of my head lifted with no problem. The bottom half stayed kind of dark. The box clearly says I can redo it up to 5 or 6 times. I did just the bottom half again and it turned my hair BLACK!!! Like greenish black!!! I pulled out the bleach immediately and removed the black. I was not happy at all with this product. I followed all the instructions.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely amazing! I cannot say enough good things about it.&lt;br /&gt;I have been dyeing my naturally medium brown hair a jet black/blue black for 10 years and this product got all of the permanent box dye out. It did take repeated treatments; I did 3 in one night and that was all I needed. It did not damage my hair whatsoever. It feels just like it did before I used the color extractor.&lt;br /&gt;After removing the black hair dye (2 treatments on the entire length of my hair and 1 concentrated ears down), I was left with burgundy hair. I redyed my hair that same night. You will want to use a hair dye about 2 shades lighter than you&#x27;re aiming for when you recolor your hair after using the Pravana treatment; your hair will really grab onto the new color. I wanted a dark chocolate brown, so I ended up dyeing my hair with a medium brown and the color came out perfectly. Great product!</li>
    <li> Some of the negative reviews for this product seem to be written by people who are not licensed hair dressers and may not be fully informed of the process. This hair treatment must be completed by a professional!  I had this process completed by a hair stylist at a salon, and my hair was lifted from a level 3 to a level 7 in one use. It will not return your hair to its natural color when it removes the color. It will leave your hair a warmer/orangish shade because red/orange tones are the basis to almost all hair colors. Although the directions seem pretty easy to follow, save yourself the headache, and have a professional use this product on your hair.</li>
    <li> This did not work as expected, and it damages your hair as much as bleach.  Removed some hair color, but not much (less than bleaching) and made my hair feel stringy and fragile.  If you use bleach correctly, you can avoid the damage to your hair, but this product damaged my hair (I only did a strand test, thank goodness).&lt;br /&gt;I have light blonde hair that I dyed dark brown, and after several months of dark brown, I attempted to use this product to remove the brown without bleaching my hair.  I followed the instructions, making sure to read other user tips beforehand, and it turned my hair a greenish orange color.  My hair was brittle and rough for weeks after using the product, until I cut most of that strand off.  I recommend just going for the bleach, which is less expensive and works better.  I bleach my own hair several times a year and it has never been damaged like this before.  This product seems more suited for minor mess-ups (dark brown to medium brown or something similar), and only if you are prepared for your hair to feel like the bristles on a broom.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews about anything, but that&#x27;s how pleased i was with this product. I had been dying my hair BOX COLOR PERMANENT jet black for over a year at least once a month. I was so sick of it and started doing a ton of research on how I could remove it safely because my hair was really long and healthy and I wanted to keep it that way. I will tell you when applying this wrapping your hair in some sort of plastic (i used a plastic jewel bag) and applying heat with a blow dryer for 20min is CRUCIAL in getting the best results. your roots will be lighter then the rest of your hair at first, don&#x27;t be alarmed, if you continue to repeat and apply it to your ends and repeat the heating process it will even out! I did it a total of 6 times in 2 days and left a conditioning treatment on for 10 mins after EACH TIME, my hair was not affected at all by this stripping process when I was done. I had a nice light brown even color when it was all finished, I went to the salon and they couldn&#x27;t believe how nice my hair felt and I got highlights and about 2 weeks later got a second set of highlights and my hair was FINALLY at my goal, blonde. I did require a trim but overall my hair turned out great! Couldn&#x27;t believe the results and I&#x27;m so happy I finally got that nasty black dye out for good.</li>
    <li> This product works! I had long black hair - I have colored it for years many different colors - and I have wanted to go lighter all over. Last month, I started the process with highlights, but it did not turn out the way I had hoped. A friend of mine told me about this product. She applied it to my hair last night and the results are awesome! My former \\&quot;fry lights\\&quot; are now a honey color and the rest of my hair is a shade of chestnut. We didn&#x27;t have to tone it because I was happy with what was under the black! My hair feels great! I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This is a professional product and should only be used by licensed trained stylists. So that one bad review I read makes it very clear that its being sold to unlicensed people who have no idea how to use it and then want to write a tell people how awful it is. If you want color extracted from your hair my professional opinion is please go to your nearest salon they have the training necessary to get the results you desire. This is a fabulous product and so much better than just bleaching, you just need the right training and or some common sense (like reading the directions) to get the best results.</li>
    <li> The lift is a slow process in that you have to use it so many times. It works but you must it many times. I had been doing dark brown coloring. I have used Pravana three times and I am only at a medium brown.  And it STINKS like perm solution.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to remove Pravana Vivids, based on the reviews I was lead to believe it would work. I used it 4 times and it faded some of the color, but did not remove it all. The instructions that come with the product state that is does not work on Vivids so I would just say be aware that it may or may not work. It did pretty much nothing to the blue, but removed most of the pink.</li>
    <li> Awesome!! Works great</li>
    <li> This product definitely works without the damage. It does smell dreadful, and its hard to get rid of the smell but my hair went from 1 to 4 in the attached picture with three washes. i had both boxed dye ( soft black) and pravana vivids (blue and violet) in my hair when I used this product. MAKE SURE you heat the product evenly and for the full twenty minutes. ^_^</li>
    <li> this stuff worked great! i went from dark dark to light brown. it did dry my hair out alot and has taken some time to get the healthy back, but overall great product.</li>
    <li> I have to try it again tonight it took alot of the color out of my hair but still alot let over and left my hair so dry its as if i bleached my hair.</li>
    <li> Tried this on my semi-permanent blue hair dye. It work hardly enough to say that it did anything. I now blue is hard to get out, but I expected better results</li>
    <li> It got out my blue sort of but not the pink at all. I even tried it twice and nothing! Waste of money</li>
    <li> I got the product in one day super fast, I lovet</li>
    <li> Absolutely fabulous product everyone! Holy shyzah. My hair has been every red and dark tone imaginable. My hair hasn&#x27;t been natural blonde since 12, after 3 applications, my hair lifted to a brassy blonde! I&#x27;m screaming it&#x27;s so awesome. I&#x27;m going silver / lavander which means I still need to bleach but ladies and gentlemen do not forget to lather100%  coconut oil in before and after so there&#x27;s minimum damage! :D</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve decided not to color my hair any longer and just let it go naturally gray. I bought this to remove the old dark color and ease the transition. Have to say I was skeptical about it working for me as I don&#x27;t have a bonnet dryer etc. I just used a plastic cap and a blow dryer. Although it says it might take three times to remove the color, after the first time I was done. It worked great for me and my very long hair which is now happily going gray.</li>
    <li> WORKS! However,If I didn&#x27;t need the product right when I got it then I would have taken it back because I searched for it on bing and found it for 26 bucks WITH shipping and tax instead of the 53 I paid here</li>
    <li> I used this product and I can say I am pretty pleased with the results. It removed a lot of the unwanted reds I had in my hair. PLEASE follow the directions or you will waste your time if it re-oxidizes and it will if you do not rinse properly. I will say that if you get pretty light results the first time I wouldn&#x27;t suggest doing it a second time or it might turn out darker (mine did). Overall it left my hair feeling and looking pretty good. It didn&#x27;t dry it out at all like I had expected. Smells pretty bad, but not as bad as other color removing products out there. Good luck! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I have naturally brunette hair that has had very gentle color on it (Keune, Goldwell).  I didn&#x27;t want to bleach so I decided to try this.  My hair turned orange- almost all of it.  It definitely pulled out my natural color also.  My stylist said that because I had gentle color &amp; porous hair, it was able to lift even the natural color.  I&#x27;m now spending $200 to fix it.  Beware,&lt;br /&gt;This is very strong!  I wouldn&#x27;t use this without consulting a professional.</li>
    <li> I never used the product , but I was able to return it hassle free.  The salon I purchsed it from was very nice and allowed me to return it since I did not use it.</li>
    <li> I had my stylist use this product on me who also carries it and is experienced in applying. I was a medium brown with caramel balayage...but red pieces were starting to pop through again from an awful experience trying to go red a few months ago. My hair is not damaged but definitely not overly healthy and I have been dying and highlighting my hair for 25 pus years. I wanted something to naturally lighten my hair so I could do a lighter base like dark blonde with beige blonde balayage. She only had to do one application. I was amazed how light it became. It was a warm light auburn orange color. But definitely not ugly. She added an ash blonde and added my highlights. Rinsed...the ash did nothing :(  still light orange. The highlights took but now I was a two toned yucky color. She added more color and heavily highlighted. Even worse. Now I&#x27;m super blonde but think yellow with some white mixed in, roots still light orange. 2 days later I came back and had her re-color and tone my ends. My hair is not holding color. My poor hair. I have to give it a break and deal with it. I rated this high because it DID work I just feel like for me...the balayage should have waited til we got the base right. So that&#x27;s my advice. You should get light enough that hopefully you can start over. I don&#x27;t know why my hair won&#x27;t grab color. I&#x27;m going to try a light brown base next and see what happens.  Good luck!</li>
    <li> this product is simply the best invention in artistic creativity. I have been coloring my hair for  33 years, and bleach kills. this product lifts the old colors and allows you to get down to business. absolutely hands down the best product for keeping your hair beautiful and healthy. I had jet black hair for 6 years and this product lifted the box color in 30 minutes and took the Pravana vivid Red like no other. Also, Pravana Vivid is the best on the market for extreme highlights and overall color. My vivid red beats Manic-Panic, and all other colors that I have used over the 33 years of coloring! start with this product and don&#x27;t waste your money or time in the salon.</li>
