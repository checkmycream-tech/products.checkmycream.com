      <li>I LOVE [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>Now I really love it.</li>
      <li>i love this brand.</li>
      <li>I then apply Lip Trip over top of this to form a barrier of protection.</li>
      <li>There is nothing better.</li>
      <li>But Lip Trip is the one lip balm I always have with me, because it doesn&#x27;t get more moisturizing and protective than this.</li>
      <li>Have been using Lip Trip  for many years.</li>
      <li>Burts bee&#x27;s is so much better.  </li>
      <li>No scent, lasts for most of the day, much better than Chap-Stick</li>
      <li>(it may also be that the top layer of the stick is waxier than the rest).</li>
      <li>My favorite lip balm.</li>
      <li>This lip balm seems more heat and sweat resistant than most.</li>
      <li>JackBlack is even better than burts bee&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>I hope this is always available!</li>
      <li>Best product for dry lips living in the desert!</li>
      <li>Excellent to pair with carmex if you are looking for the tingle and helps other lip blams</li>
      <li>It arrived very quickly after placing the order.</li>
      <li>This is a thicker, bees wax based product with a very very mild mint flavor.</li>
      <li>THANK YOU MOUNTAIN OCEAN for such an amazing real true to your word product!</li>
      <li>Price: $59.88&lt;br /&gt;Price: $7.69 Free Shipping for Prime Members&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is such a GREAT product.  </li>
      <li>Lip Trip kept my lips comfortable for years.</li>
      <li>This product is fantastic.</li>
      <li>Nanak&#x27;s is also available through Amazon, and has an SPF value of 10 by itself.  </li>
      <li>The combination of the two is fantastic.</li>
      <li>Maybe i just got an old tube because everyone else loved it?  </li>
      <li>I love mint in lip balms and this one only has the slightest hint of mint-- gone before you were sure it was there.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always liked Lip Trip--it&#x27;s a good SPF and goes on smooth, non greasy and doesn&#x27;t have an unappealing taste.</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars because cosmetically, it&#x27;s not that exciting.</li>
      <li>I was right.</li>
      <li>This product has little odor or taste which is a good thing.  </li>
      <li>I saw it was made in Colorado, so I knew the creators must know first hand what they are talking about.</li>
      <li>This product actually advertises that it has more Bees Wax than Burt&#x27;s Bees, and you can feel it.</li>
      <li>Lip Trip was my favorite lip balm EVER, my one and only since my college days.</li>
      <li>I have tried all chapstick and I have to say that this has the absolute best and only chapstick that I have used for the past 10 years.  </li>
      <li>Doing that, my lips are fine all day, without any further applications, and I have never had my lips sunburned when using the combination.  </li>
      <li>The lanolin/beeswax combo is an absolute powerhouse when it comes to staying ON the lips and holding in moisture for hours.</li>
      <li>Doesnt wear off of lips on cups/glasses much.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping</li>
      <li>and the price is reasonable.</li>
      <li>So I did, with high expectations because of how much I like their moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is hard, and waxy, and does not moisturize well on its own.  </li>
      <li>After so many years of regular use my lips (only my lips) had developed a sensitivity to the SPF ingredient.</li>
      <li>I love this lotion but the lip balm is to hard and wont really spread onto my lips as I would like it too.</li>
      <li>This is a bate and switch page, the old listing was the pack of 12.</li>
      <li>I will often use this in combination with Carmex, Carmex contains natural emollients, like cocoa butter and lanolin, which suck in moisture.</li>
      <li>Save your money carmex was better than this, at least that lasts awhile.</li>
      <li>do like that it&#x27;s all natural, but I won&#x27;t be purchasing this one again.</li>
      <li>It lasts about 6 months or more for me and it is thick, but is matte and not greasy at all.</li>
      <li>it goes on thicker than most other lip balms but it keeps your lips from getting chapped longer than other lip balms.</li>
      <li>Normally if I&#x27;m in need of a thick coat of chapstick I put on a layer of this and a layer of a regular, easily spreadable type.</li>
      <li>The bees wax is thick, so it stays on during hard exercise and the sunscreen works great.  </li>
      <li>Perhaps the seller I purchased from sent me an old one, as I noticed my old chapsticks that I have at home become the same consistency.  </li>
      <li>I found this in a natural market i happened upon in Colorado while traveling cross country.  </li>
      <li>It is gentle but works hard and really protects your lips.</li>
      <li>It does the job as far as relieving dry, chapped lips.  </li>

<li> It does the job as far as relieving dry, chapped lips.  </li>
<li> I have searched HIGH &amp; LOW for a Chapstick that didn&#x27;t contain alcohol that dries out my lips forcing me to reapply every 20-30 minutes and had no success until I came across this product in a clearance bin!</li>
<li> Do have no need to reapply nearly as often as any other product on the market.  </li>
<li> Pretty bummed because if I looked hard enough</li>
<li> Long lasting moisture and never dries out my lips!</li>
<li> This is the only moisturizer I use on my lips, and it&#x27;s really dry here in Las Vegas.  </li>
<li> It has no scent and has a high quality list of materials, which differentiates it from the usual store-bought lip balms.</li>
<li> However, I found the product very sticky and hard to get from the tube to my lips.  </li>
<li> Immediately went back the next day and bought the other two lip trips in the clearance bin and haven&#x27;t bought anything else since!</li>
<li> It&#x27;s definitely for extreme winter type of usage.</li>
<li> one likes dry or cracked</li>
<li> It took a little bit of time for me to  get used to it because I generally use to using petroleum based product: Vaseline, Chapstick..etc.</li>
<li> I stumbled upon this product in a small natural health store in Mount Vernon, Ohio of all places.</li>
<li> I ride a motorcycle and my lips get very dry and cracked, but not anymore</li>
<li> Thick, thick lip balm, exactly what I was looking for!  </li>
<li> Not much of a desirable scent to it, but once on</li>
<li> You no longer need any other lip balm.  </li>
<li> Like one of the previous reviewers, I first thought I&#x27;d gotten a stale tube when I opened this.</li>
<li> I was not used to such thick, waxy lip balm.</li>
<li> There is no appreciable flavor, nothing to mask the slightly \\&quot;sheepy,\\&quot; oily scent of lanolin.</li>
<li> If your lips require little to no moisture and you like the taste of a waxed candle then go for it.</li>
<li> This can be a little sore on severely chapped lips, so carry it in a pocket that is warmed by your body heat.</li>
<li> I will never use any other lip balm again!!</li>
<li> As I said, it may take you a little while to get used to it, especially if you&#x27;re used to heavily flavored thin vaseline lip balms.</li>
<li> I found that I got used to the texture after a few applications</li>
<li> The tube is pretty stark and ugly, too.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Move over Burts Bees this is THE HOLY GRAIL of lip balms. I found this in a natural market i happened upon in Colorado while traveling cross country.  I ride a motorcycle and my lips get very dry and cracked, but not anymore cause Liptrip is the shiznit! Get some!</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this and purchased it solely based on others&#x27; glowing reviews.  However, I found the product very sticky and hard to get from the tube to my lips.  Perhaps the seller I purchased from sent me an old one, as I noticed my old chapsticks that I have at home become the same consistency.  Pretty bummed because if I looked hard enough I probably could have found it in a store and saved the shipping cost and gotten a newer product.</li>
    <li> Felt like I accidentally grabbed clarinet wax instead of chapstick.  Too waxy with no moisture in it.  Maybe i just got an old tube because everyone else loved it?  Will never buy again.  Burts bee&#x27;s is so much better.  JackBlack is even better than burts bee&#x27;s.  This is just not good at all.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many years while climbing, backpacking, skiing and biking.  The bees wax is thick, so it stays on during hard exercise and the sunscreen works great.  I consider it essential gear for any outing in the sun and wind.</li>
    <li> You no longer need any other lip balm.  This is the best.  It does not have to be reapplied repeatedly.  It is gentle but works hard and really protects your lips.</li>
    <li> I stumbled upon this product in a small natural health store in Mount Vernon, Ohio of all places. I saw it was made in Colorado, so I knew the creators must know first hand what they are talking about. I was right. This product is fantastic. Lip Trip locks in the moisture, protecting your lips with a layer of bees wax. It took a little bit of time for me to  get used to it because I generally use to using petroleum based product: Vaseline, Chapstick..etc. This product actually advertises that it has more Bees Wax than Burt&#x27;s Bees, and you can feel it. I will often use this in combination with Carmex, Carmex contains natural emollients, like cocoa butter and lanolin, which suck in moisture. I then apply Lip Trip over top of this to form a barrier of protection. The only downside to Lip Trip is that it can become very hard when it gets cold, so you have to press extra firm to apply it. This can be a little sore on severely chapped lips, so carry it in a pocket that is warmed by your body heat. I have used this product on both coasts, Wyoming, Colorado, Montana, Tennessee, Ohio, Virginia &amp; Georgia. I take it everywhere, and bought a 12 pack to give out to friends. As I said, it may take you a little while to get used to it, especially if you&#x27;re used to heavily flavored thin vaseline lip balms. This is a thicker, bees wax based product with a very very mild mint flavor. Try it! If you don&#x27;t like it send it to me! 80)</li>
    <li> I have used this product for decades.  It is hard, and waxy, and does not moisturize well on its own.  The trick is to use a softer lip balm under it to moisturize well, then cover that with the LIP Trip SPF 15.  Doing that, my lips are fine all day, without any further applications, and I have never had my lips sunburned when using the combination.  By the way, I use Nanak&#x27;s Lip Smoothee, Unscented, under the Lip Trip.  Nanak&#x27;s is also available through Amazon, and has an SPF value of 10 by itself.  However, without the Lip Trip over it, it wears off during the day.  The combination of the two is fantastic.</li>
    <li> Great product. Fast shipping</li>
    <li> The BEST lip balm EVER!  Have been using Lip Trip  for many years. Well done Mountain Ocean for a SUPERB product!</li>
    <li> Been using for years. No scent, lasts for most of the day, much better than Chap-Stick</li>
    <li> tHE BEST lip stuff ever!</li>
    <li> This is the only moisturizer I use on my lips, and it&#x27;s really dry here in Las Vegas.  I&#x27;ve been using Lip Trip for about 6 years and it&#x27;s the best for keeping my lips moisturized and smooth.</li>
    <li> This is such a GREAT product.  Do have no need to reapply nearly as often as any other product on the market.  I hope this is always available!</li>
    <li> If you use this in the winter, you won&#x27;t have chapped lips. If you start to get chapped lips and you put this on at night before bed, they will be healed by morning. End of story. It is made of good quality ingredients. There is nothing better.</li>
    <li> Works great.  It&#x27;s thicker so it stays on longer.</li>
    <li> i love this brand. has a nice consistency, pleasant but mild taste. sun protection, too. and the price is reasonable.</li>
    <li> its hard to spread onto my lips. Thats my biggest complaint, not to mention the price is ridiculous considering i feel like im trying to spread a glue stick on my lips.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always liked Lip Trip--it&#x27;s a good SPF and goes on smooth, non greasy and doesn&#x27;t have an unappealing taste.</li>
    <li> A little expensive, but def. keeps my lips protected from cold. I dont have chapped lips anymore - not in the bitterest cold!</li>
    <li> Has a smell and taste that is pretty bad.</li>
    <li> Umm, well its not very moisturizing, doesn&#x27;t last long, and tastes terrible. Save your money carmex was better than this, at least that lasts awhile. If your lips require little to no moisture and you like the taste of a waxed candle then go for it.</li>
    <li> This product has little odor or taste which is a good thing.  It does the job as far as relieving dry, chapped lips.  The one drawback is that it is a bit stiff which makes it difficult to feel as though enough has been applied.</li>
    <li> Thick, thick lip balm, exactly what I was looking for!  EXCELLENT FOR SKIING!  I can put it on at night and still there by morning.  Doesnt wear off of lips on cups/glasses much.  Not much of a desirable scent to it, but once on you cant tell.  No tingle at all from peppermint oil and no flavor.  Excellent to pair with carmex if you are looking for the tingle and helps other lip blams last longer.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how serious this product would be, as in how thick. It&#x27;s definitely for extreme winter type of usage. Normally if I&#x27;m in need of a thick coat of chapstick I put on a layer of this and a layer of a regular, easily spreadable type.</li>
    <li> it goes on thicker than most other lip balms but it keeps your lips from getting chapped longer than other lip balms. doesn&#x27;t leave a shine on your lips either which is nice as well. definitely a good stocking stuffer or gift to someone who always has chapped lips. would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> My favorite lip balm. It arrived very quickly after placing the order.</li>
    <li> This is the best lip balm that I have ever used. It lasts about 6 months or more for me and it is thick, but is matte and not greasy at all. It is great for men who want to eliminate chapped lips without having greasy or overly scented lips. The SPF is a nice touch. It has no scent and has a high quality list of materials, which differentiates it from the usual store-bought lip balms.</li>
    <li> Have never been without Lip Trip since the 70&#x27;s!  It&#x27;s the BEST!</li>
    <li> Like one of the previous reviewers, I first thought I&#x27;d gotten a stale tube when I opened this. I was not used to such thick, waxy lip balm. I found that I got used to the texture after a few applications (it may also be that the top layer of the stick is waxier than the rest). Now I really love it. The lanolin/beeswax combo is an absolute powerhouse when it comes to staying ON the lips and holding in moisture for hours. Lip Trip also makes a great lipstick base because it has a matte finish that doesn&#x27;t add shine or sheerness to lip colors; it just helps them stay on and feel great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars because cosmetically, it&#x27;s not that exciting. There is no appreciable flavor, nothing to mask the slightly \\&quot;sheepy,\\&quot; oily scent of lanolin. I love mint in lip balms and this one only has the slightest hint of mint-- gone before you were sure it was there. The tube is pretty stark and ugly, too. But Lip Trip is the one lip balm I always have with me, because it doesn&#x27;t get more moisturizing and protective than this.</li>
    <li> This is a bate and switch page, the old listing was the pack of 12. look at this:&lt;br /&gt;List Price: $59.88&lt;br /&gt;Price: $7.69 Free Shipping for Prime Members&lt;br /&gt;You Save: $52.19 (87%)&lt;br /&gt;What actually gets shipped is 1 individual lip balm.</li>
    <li> I have tried all chapstick and I have to say that this has the absolute best and only chapstick that I have used for the past 10 years.  You don&#x27;t become &amp;#34;addicted&amp;#34; to it like others that you have to keep reapplying...it actually heals your chapped lips with a couple of applications.  It&#x27;s also good in the summer for preventing sunburnt lips. I will never use any other lip balm again!!</li>
    <li> Lip Trip was my favorite lip balm EVER, my one and only since my college days. Lip Trip kept my lips comfortable for years. Until one day I used it and my lips began to tingle and feel sunburnt--and I had not been in the sun.  I tried other brands of lip balms and found that any with SPF gave me the same unpleasant reaction. After so many years of regular use my lips (only my lips) had developed a sensitivity to the SPF ingredient. :-(&lt;br /&gt;In hindsight, if I had only used Lip Trip during the day (and switched to a non-SPF lip balm at night), perhaps I could have continued using my cherished Lip Trip for another 30 years. If Lip Trip would make a non-SPF version, I&#x27;d buy it.</li>
    <li> I have searched HIGH &amp; LOW for a Chapstick that didn&#x27;t contain alcohol that dries out my lips forcing me to reapply every 20-30 minutes and had no success until I came across this product in a clearance bin! So I thought I&#x27;d try it. Immediately went back the next day and bought the other two lip trips in the clearance bin and haven&#x27;t bought anything else since! I SWEAR BY THIS PRODUCT! Long lasting moisture and never dries out my lips! THANK YOU MOUNTAIN OCEAN for such an amazing real true to your word product!</li>
    <li> Best product for dry lips living in the desert!</li>
    <li> This lip balm seems more heat and sweat resistant than most. So it doesn&#x27;t soften when carrying it all day while cycling, and stays on your lips once you put it on.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion but the lip balm is to hard and wont really spread onto my lips as I would like it too.</li>
    <li> In sunny florida &amp;#34;Lip Trip&amp;#34; is a must.&lt;br /&gt;No one likes dry or cracked lips.&lt;br /&gt;they don&#x27;t look good and don&#x27;t feel good !</li>
    <li> I LOVE [[ASIN:B0001TQ9WI Mountain Ocean Skin Trip Moisturizer, Coconut, 8-Ounce]] and every time I pass this lip balm in the store I always think about getting it. So I did, with high expectations because of how much I like their moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a disappointment. It is hard, and difficult to apply to my lips (maybe this will be easier in the summer/warm weather?). Personally, I don&#x27;t like how it feels, smells or how it makes my lips stick together. Yuck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like that it&#x27;s all natural, but I won&#x27;t be purchasing this one again. I do not recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(But, if you have tried this product and hate it, don&#x27;t let that deter you from trying their moisturizer! It&#x27;s NOTHING like this!)</li>
