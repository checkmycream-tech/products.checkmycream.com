      <li>This is a great product.</li>
      <li>My dentist told me that Act is the best cavity fighting / prevention mouthwash available.</li>
      <li>Dentist says its a good idea, so i use it.</li>
      <li>ACT has one of the best mouthwashes available.</li>
      <li>I have now learned why act is better, so go for it!</li>
      <li>It has a good taste to it and helps keep my mouth really clean.</li>
      <li>I used to use listerine, even when my dentist would tell me act is better.</li>
      <li>it is refreshing without being overpowering.  </li>
      <li>I love Act mouth wash.</li>
      <li>I love the mouthwash but not for 15.39-I</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re brushing and flossing like you should, it&#x27;s healthy and nessisary to have germs in the mouth.</li>
      <li>The cool splash mint flavor is refreshing and tastes nice.</li>
      <li>ACT Restoring Mouthwash, Cool Splash Mint is very very refreshing, and it makes your mouth feel totally clean and gives you nice fresh breath.</li>
      <li>No cavities  - mouth feels clean.  </li>
      <li>large bottle and last a good while.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Keeps my breath fresh.</li>
      <li>makes mouth feel so fresh.</li>
      <li>But I recently heard that it, like most mouth washes, is only good for freshening breath.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not too intense or sweet.</li>
      <li>The mouthwash is refreshing and is not too strong like other brands.</li>
      <li>This one cleanses and restores without harming your delicate mouth skin, and the flavor is good and light.  </li>
      <li>So I would recommend this, especially for the great price for such a large amount</li>
      <li>I always buy in quality  to make sure I do not run low.</li>
      <li>The one mouthwash the whole family agrees on.  </li>

      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>and it really help with my sensitive teeth.</li>
      <li>Not a strong flavor, so its nice for daily use.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not harsh to use as Listerine can be.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s basically no cleaning action from this thing, its just a knock off that relies on impulse buys.</li>
      <li>I had some sensitive teeth, a couple softening, etc...</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m in my 50s &amp; have old teeth...</li>
      <li>Still wish they&#x27;d go with less sweet, natural-citrus flavorings.</li>
      <li>This mouthwash has a light flavor as opposed to those stronger ones, but it takes very little since it seems somehow thicker.  </li>
      <li>Apparently, the Amazon website and the Amazon shop app for the Kindle Fire 7\\&quot; list ingredients.</li>
      <li>but I do not really like the taste of the ACT mint flavor and much prefer phosflur.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not a strong flavor, so its nice for daily use. Dentist says its a good idea, so i use it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Used this twice a day and it really help with my sensitive teeth. This was recommended by my dentist.</li>
    <li> This mouthwash promises enamel can be restored using this product.  Some say enamel cannot be restored.  I like the mouthwash and am using it regularly it is refreshing without being overpowering.  I just hate it contains flouride when will they stop pushing this useless waste product?</li>
    <li> My dentist recommend I get this mouthwash to help with a cavity that was beginning to form. After using it for a month, I&#x27;m noticing a difference! I would totally recommend using this to strengthen your teeth and heal some cavities!</li>
    <li> This mouthwash contains alcohol, which is not disclosed on the front label OR in the Amazon native Shop app for the Amazon Kindle Fire HD. There are actually NO ingredients listed using the app. Apparently, the Amazon website and the Amazon shop app for the Kindle Fire 7\\&quot; list ingredients. I had even used a magnifying glass to inspect the front label, which does not list alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mouthwash containing alcohol is not effective for dry mouth, it can actually make the condition worse. So, Kindle Fire HD users, be forewarned! This mouthwash DOES contain alcohol!!</li>
    <li> I love Act mouth wash. It has a good taste to it and helps keep my mouth really clean. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love the mouthwash but not for 15.39-I thought I was buying a pack of three. No way I&#x27;m paying 15.00 for 1 bottle of mouthwash. I returned.</li>
    <li> This bottle lasts a long time, and is used daily. The mouthwash is refreshing and is not too strong like other brands.</li>
    <li> I wanted Listerine but thought this cheaper option would be acceptable, but boy was I wrong.  There&#x27;s basically no cleaning action from this thing, its just a knock off that relies on impulse buys.</li>
    <li> This mouthwash has a light flavor as opposed to those stronger ones, but it takes very little since it seems somehow thicker.  It does it&#x27;s job to protect and cleanse your mouth.  Mistakenly some people think mouthwashes don&#x27;t cleanse unless they make your mouth feel like a layer of mouth skin is gone, little exaggeration, but you know what I mean.  This one cleanses and restores without harming your delicate mouth skin, and the flavor is good and light.  Yes, you can cleanse without being abrasive.</li>
    <li> Use this product only for teeth brushing and mouthwash for the past five years.  No cavities  - mouth feels clean.  Brush with it several times a day  I always buy in quality  to make sure I do not run low.</li>
    <li> I had some sensitive teeth, a couple softening, etc...&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my 50s &amp; have old teeth...&lt;br /&gt;OMG!&lt;br /&gt;Buy some...you&#x27;ll see for yourself...it works!!!</li>
    <li> ACT Restoring Mouthwash, Cool Splash Mint is very very refreshing, and it makes your mouth feel totally clean and gives you nice fresh breath. I have used this mouthwash for a long time, and will continue to use it. Great price on Amazon, too!</li>
    <li> Maybe it just takes awhile for the other effects they list to show, but in my experience, I didn&#x27;t notice much, if any, change in the other effects like restoring enamel, ect. But in the end, even though it&#x27;s not the strongest mouthwash I&#x27;ve used, it freshened my breath and did everything what a mouthwash should. So I would recommend this, especially for the great price for such a large amount, that should last you a long time.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s probably just a personal preference but I do not really like the taste of the ACT mint flavor and much prefer phosflur.</li>
    <li> ACT has one of the best mouthwashes available.</li>
    <li> My dentist told me that Act is the best cavity fighting / prevention mouthwash available. It&#x27;s not harsh to use as Listerine can be. Keeps my breath fresh.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read some reviews saying this sucks Bc there&#x27;s not germ killing alcohol. You don&#x27;t need it! If you&#x27;re brushing and flossing like you should, it&#x27;s healthy and nessisary to have germs in the mouth. Just like on your gut. I use this to prevent and help heal weak spots and cavities. Also it helps sensitivity if you&#x27;re whitening.</li>
    <li> A must have-def works.  dental hygenist didnt take as long cleaning my teeth-and i feel it was my use of this!!  so recommend.  makes mouth feel so fresh.</li>
    <li> ..but read the labels. This product has half the amt. of flouride as some of the other ACT rinses (IF flouride is a priority for you). Still wish they&#x27;d go with less sweet, natural-citrus flavorings.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Act for as long as i can remember. I like that it&#x27;s not too intense or sweet. But I recently heard that it, like most mouth washes, is only good for freshening breath. It doesn&#x27;t kill germs.  I&#x27;ll be switching to Listerine after this bottle.</li>
    <li> ACT is the best.  The one mouthwash the whole family agrees on.  We have tried other brands, but will keep buying ACT.</li>
    <li> Works great.&lt;br /&gt;It really does fight plaque.&lt;br /&gt;Nice large bottle and last a good while.&lt;br /&gt;I wont go back to Listerine.</li>
    <li> I used to use listerine, even when my dentist would tell me act is better. I have now learned why act is better, so go for it!</li>
    <li> Act Restoring mouthwash works well. My teeth feeling cleaner longer. The cool splash mint flavor is refreshing and tastes nice.</li>
    <li> Ever since I began using this product I have never used anything else for an after brushing mouth wash. It definitely works!</li>
    <li> Thought this was a three pack. Only received one bottle.</li>
