<li> Not much to say about toothpaste.</li>
<li> Kind of hard to give toothpaste a bad rating.</li>
<li> I misread the box and thought I was ordering the ordinary Crest with no bells and whistles.  </li>
<li> I usually buy six tubes at a time.  </li>
<li> They usually have the flavor, but it always has baking soda in it, which I don&#x27;t want.  </li>

    <li> My wife and I really like the Crest gel!</li>
    <li> The only toothpaste I like is Crest Cool Mint.  I am able to order it on amazon.com.  I usually buy six tubes at a time.  This time I ordered two tubes to supplement my supply.  I am very happy with the delivery of the toothpaste also.  I ordered it on Friday, and received it on Monday.</li>
    <li> My favorite toothpaste! Great flavor and I love getting our supply replenished with Subscribe &amp; Save</li>
    <li> So glad I went back to Crest after a year on Nature&#x27;s Gate flouride free! Now my teeth are actually clean!</li>
    <li> Kind of hard to give toothpaste a bad rating. Cavity protection perfection!</li>
    <li> I usually can&#x27;t find this exact toothpaste at WalMart.  They usually have the flavor, but it always has baking soda in it, which I don&#x27;t want.  The price is good in the Subscribe &amp; Save option.</li>
    <li> Classic toothpaste out of a tube. Exactly what I was looking for. Amazon does it again!</li>
    <li> product as described--shipped in 2 days</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it a long time.</li>
    <li> Used for years. Still have one baby tooth!</li>
    <li> Yep  this is toothpaste, it work about like you&#x27;d expect :) my bf only uses this kind so I have set up a monthly delivery which is awesome</li>
    <li> Its toothpaste. Enough said.</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste that has a positive background and history !!</li>
    <li> They say &amp;#34;if it ain&#x27;t broke then don&#x27;t fix it&amp;#34; and that is very true in regards to toothpaste.  I&#x27;ve been using Crest toothpaste for my entire life and refuse to switch to any other brand.  It works well for me and the formula seems as if it has not changed.  I prefer this original formula because the cost is typically lower than the &amp;#34;fancier&amp;#34; Crest toothpaste varieties.</li>
    <li> Not much to say about toothpaste. One thing I do like about this particular variety is that there is no overwhelming minty flavor.</li>
    <li> This is the only toothpaste i use, as it is not overpowerful and does not burn my mouth. I have been using this for 15~ years, cavitiy free since 2003</li>
    <li> Okay, only gel I can stand right now.</li>
    <li> Only toothpaste I like so happy I know I can get it from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great value toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I misread the box and thought I was ordering the ordinary Crest with no bells and whistles.  This turns out to be a gel, and it&#x27;s much, much, much sweeter than the original version.  Nevertheless, I have gotten used to it and it seems to work as well as the original.</li>
    <li> great toothpaste and a good value for the money.</li>
