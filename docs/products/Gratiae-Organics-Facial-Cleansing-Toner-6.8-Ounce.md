<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I never used toner until I tried this brand.  It refreshes my skin and cleans out my pores.  It is a good preparation for moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I love the body scrub so much that this toner was disappointing. My skin doesn&#x27;t feel as clean or toned as it does with other products. Stick with the body scrub, go to someone else for your toner.</li>
    <li> Over other face toners I think this is one of the best&lt;br /&gt;I have cleaned my face everyday for 3 years already</li>
    <li> Great to get off make up.  I wash my face and it still gets dirt out without drying my skin.  I recommend this product and company to everyone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;received on time and in good packaging.  Thank you</li>
    <li> Non drying, great toner</li>
    <li> This is a very good toner.  Helps to clean your skin after washing it and helps to smooth your skin.  Very good quality toner.  You can&#x27;t go wrong using this toner.</li>
    <li> Originally found these products in Las Vegas and they are EXPENSIVE!  All organic and so far, the few things I&#x27;ve tried are really good.  Found a decent price on Amazon and will always check here first for anything from this line as far as pricing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product itself is wonderful.  Not crazy about the pump dispensing, but I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I bought this product along with the face wash and my skin looks great! I have tried everything on the shelves, proactiv, but this product completely cleared up my skin. My face feels so soft after I use these products. I have been using them for over a year and will not use anything else. I recently bought the face lotion and that has been working great aswell. I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> I have (very) dry skin and earlier i used many kinds of toners before (like cheap ones in the drug store or even Clinique) but every single time my skin felt especially dry afterwards. Probably all those contained more alcohol in them as they should.&lt;br /&gt;This toner still contains some alcohol but it doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel dry or look dry. It is refreshing. Afterwards I use the facial serum and after waiting a little bit i apply the day or night cream.&lt;br /&gt;So i will keep on buying it at least until someone shows me a better toner without alcohol ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And additionally the price is really great. Don&#x27;t try at the kiosks in malls. They charge way more but try to sell it like it would be a special price (\\&quot;I will give you a special discount...\\&quot; and so on...) Don&#x27;t get fooled by them. I ordered mine from cosmetic4less and the delivery was very fast (even though i live in Europe!)</li>
    <li> Love this very mild facial cleanser.  Really pulls the dirt off my skin. I do not wear makeup</li>
    <li> I like this toner, at first I thought it might be too drying however that only lasted a couple of days.  This toner does not sting my skin and I really think it helps to remove any excess dirt and oil after cleansing.  I feel that my cleanser should remove all dirt and oil and the cotton ball should be completely free of make-up, etc. after using the toner, unfortunately I have yet to come across a cleanser that good!!!!  This has a little scent which actually smells really fresh after it dries.  I will order another bottle of this and continue to use......until I find something I like better and trust me, I&#x27;ve been searching for a very long time!!!</li>
    <li> Tonic came opened and due to that half of it splitted inside the parcel. Was very upset.</li>
    <li> My daughters use this product.  It is mild and organic, so I like that.  But most of it spilled during shipment, so there is not much left to use.</li>
    <li> This product is not just a Toner but also a cleanser. It makes your face feel  so clean and fresh. It will remove your cleansing products plus anything you&#x27;ve used in the shower like shampoo, etc. and return your skin to it&#x27;s normal ph. On days that I have only used moisturizer and no makeup, I only use this product to cleanse/tone my face. It makes my face feel wonderful.</li>
    <li> I received this item as a gift from a kiosk in the mall.  I LOVE it.  I use it in the morning to remove the night cream.  I don&#x27;t use a cleanser or water--just the toner with a cotton ball. It is so gentle and affective.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have tried everything. I usually don&#x27;t do store bought toner, I make my own, either a mix of apple cider vinegar and water or hydrogen peroxide and water. Mainly I did this because I wanted natural products. Astringent usually dries me out, but it is effective in removing makeup left behind instead of scrubbing. I have very sensitive skin and acne-ish skin and yet this is fabulous. Does not dry, just a nice smooth feeling with a pleasant scent. Bonus...I had a friend tell me my skin is glowing! I have never once in my life heard that because of problatic skin. Yay grataiea !!</li>
    <li> This product is great!  just like the other reveiewers, I was appraoched in Vegas at a hotel and demo&#x27;d the product and results were pretty good.  Decided to check Amazon first and good I did!  Received the product and it is exactly as what I saw in vegas, because i took pictures of the product and box.  This is also made in israel and the packaging and product appear to be the same and the results are also great!  Saved a lot of money!&lt;br /&gt;I am a little disappointed with people rating their experience with the product marketing in Vegas, rather than the product and their experience in here.</li>
    <li> Gratiae products do not work</li>
    <li> it works great. it is a good and effective item for the price paid. i do totally recommend this cleanser.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent skin cleanser.  It removes all makeup residue with one washing.  I use an astringent after each cleansing and the cotton pad is always clean.  So...no makeup residue left behind.</li>
    <li> I love this facial cleanser.  It makes you feel so refreshed and clean.  I have used this now for 2 years and will continue to use it.  On Amazon you get the best price.  In Las Vegas Paris they sell it for $250.00 which is a total rip off. I made the mistake and gave it a one.</li>
    <li> It came half full...it leaked...why can&#x27;t packaging be better sent back question are got no response to it ...sad ..</li>
    <li> Gratiae Organics are amazing products. My skin type is oily and it is very difficult for me to find facial skin products that can counter act the excessive facial oil in my face, with these products I am able to do this with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gratiae Organics Cleansing and Peeling Foam is amazing it is smooth and creates a rich lather that distributes properly on the surface of your face. I love it because it does not contain any oils and has a pleasant scent. After I use this product my skin feels smooth,clean and has no traces of oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gratiae Organics Facial Toner is also oil free and leaves my face feeling clean and refreshed for my daily facial moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both products are true to size and come neatly sealed in a plastic wrapper to prevent spills shipping is fast. Loved the product.</li>
    <li> Product was nothing like one I ordered previously, it was like using water. Arrived taped up, not in a box.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year,  wroth every dine. I&#x27;m over fifty years old, I look like I&#x27;m in my thirty&#x27;s, Because of same type of product in this line.</li>
    <li> Compared to many other toners on the market, this one cleans remarkably without the sting. I dabble some on a cotton ball every night for my face and neck and have noticed significant improvement in the pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended!</li>
    <li> This is a super product that I have been using for 3 years now and love the results that it gives to my skin.</li>
    <li> Let me tell you, The lady at the mall gave this to me for free because I bought a soap but this is amazing. Toners always burn my face and new products usual break me out because I have super sensitive skin but this is amazing, I take a cotton swab and press some into it and ir removes my make up and leaves my face fresh but not dry. I like it. I would buy again</li>
    <li> I will recommend this product to my friends. It gives energy to my skin, my face seems more healthy and feels fresh</li>
    <li> This toner refreshed my skin without drying it out. One of the best I&#x27;ve ever used. I recommend it for all skin types.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It feels clean and I notice a positive difference in my complexion.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love all the Gratiae Products.  I had a facial recently and the Esthetician asked what skin care line use.  When I told her, she said well keep using it, your skin looks great!!</li>
    <li> Believe me when I say this, I have tried everything! Finally, thanks to a friend, I have the right product for my skin type. I love this product and I am so fearful of running out, that I decided to order enough  too last me at least a year. That&#x27;s how confident and happy I am with the results. With that being said...don&#x27;t go out and spend a small fortune, shop around for the right price, its out there.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used Clinique toner but this one makes my skin feel refreshed without that slight stinging feeling that Clinique gives.</li>
    <li> I purchase this product often.  It&#x27;s a great product and is very gentle.</li>
    <li> Great product! Doesn&#x27;t burn and came perfectly packaged so it wouldn&#x27;t spill! Also doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like most toners!</li>
    <li> I have never used a toner so thought I would get my act together for the sake of my mature skin. This toner is not drying and gets the last traces of makeup off. Feels really fresh.</li>
    <li> Learn about this product in Las Vegas, was a little expensive at the mall. She try the product on me and I was hooked. Glad to know amazon carries the product at my much more reasonable average citizen can afford.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic, it removes the dead skin cells, and does not dry your skin out like other toners!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite Gratiae product along with the under eye cream. This smells fab and if you use it at night with nothing else over it, your face is smooth and soft and hydrated in the AM! No night cream! But you have to try all the other Gratiae products and Take years off your face.</li>
    <li> a bit too drying for my mature skin. Great for teens or anyone with oily skin. All Gratiae products are wonderfully made and on Amazon the price is unbelievable.</li>
    <li> Love the way it makes my face feel.  I have used some of their other items and liked those also.</li>
    <li> I have oily but sensitive skin that I never do exfoliate my face. Gratiae Organics Facial Cleansing Toner is perfect for me: It cleans my face without irritating it. My skin especially my T-Zone is more finer and smoother after applying. I recommend this  toner as a everyday soft clean toner for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have used toners in the past and they dry my skin out. This product doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and removes the dirt and oil without drying my skin out. I use it after showering.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive combination oily skin and this is perfect for me. It doesn&#x27;t burn or have any strong smell. DONT BUY FROM KIOSKS THEY ARE OVERPRICED!!!</li>
    <li> I ran out and went back to my old toner for awhile and noticed a difference. Great part of my daily routine.</li>
    <li> I really like this toner, it has a very fresh smell to it and it does not leave my skin feeling stingy or sticky. To me it feels very soothing on my skin.</li>
    <li> I just received this toner today and was very dissapointed. It was wrapped in a plastic bag, was not boxed and was secured with a tape, some of it leaked into the plastic bag. This is the first time I am dealing with such an unprofessional approach. Very dissapointed</li>
    <li> Great product and very good value for money, would recommend this to anyone, have very sensitive skin and this product was fantastic</li>
    <li> It leaked all over and I have not heard anything back. I love Gratiae, but surely they could find a better way to ship so that it doesn&#x27;t spill/leak all over. Waste of money! Very dissapointed!</li>
    <li> All this brands products deliver what they say. Definitely would recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a really great toner that works great and has a lovely smell. I felt like it was exfoliating to my facial and neck skin but there was no irritation.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, I love the way it makes my skin look and feel. I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> I liked the way my skin felt after I applied the toner, but I don&#x27;t know that I would pay retail price for this item.</li>
    <li> This product dried out my skin. I was very disappointed, I have never used a toner that would dry out my skin so much. Will not purchase again</li>
    <li> LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT THIS IS THE BEST FACIAL CLEANSER EVER . MY DAUGHTER AND I BOTH USE AND LOVE IT SHE IS 43 AND I JUST TURNED 70 AND WE BOTH HAVE SKIN LIKE A BABY AND BELIEVE ME THAT TAKES WORK ON OUR PART AND THESE PRODUCTS ARE SENSATIONAL - LOVE YOUR PRICES</li>
    <li> leaves my face oil free all day , which I thought would be impossible . it says to use on clean skin , but I USE it to clean my face and take my makeup off . works extremely well &amp; am now almost acne free , which I thought would also be impossible because nothing else has ever worked .</li>
