      <li>I now use this product underneath my mascara in the morning withouth any issues and my eyelashas are amazing.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used it on it&#x27;s own tho.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m thrilled with the results, and have just started tube #2</li>
      <li>/&gt;What makes this product particularly nice, is that it does not irritate my eyes in the least.&lt;br</li>
      <li>L&#x27;Oreal Lash Boosting Serum is a nice way of enhancing one&#x27;s lashes.  </li>
      <li>The best thing I think I can say to really let everyone know</li>
      <li>With L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Lash Booster, my eyelashes are looking really nice</li>
      <li>I put it on everynight before bed, and in the am before my own mascara, and every weekend, and it just... didn&#x27;t DO anything.</li>
      <li>The Avon lady at work asked what kind of mascara I was using-she thought I was wearing mascara</li>
      <li>and it did not look good at all if I did not wash it all off and put mascara on top of it.</li>
      <li>how good L&#x27;oreal Lash boost works is to say that after all the stuff I&#x27;ve tried this is the ONLY product for lashes that I would ever tell my mom or my best friend to go buy.</li>
      <li>Hope you love it too! :-)    </li>
      <li>It did not produce more lashes, yet it gave the appearance of fuller lashes for a nice look.</li>
      <li>Those thinner areas are filling in nicely, giving my brows a more even and fuller look.</li>
      <li>I can sweep the mascara upwards on my top lashes, and they will curve up and stay there nicely.</li>
      <li>this item came as it was stated &amp; described and the delivery was quick &amp; it came in good condition</li>
      <li>After reading so many rave reviews of this product, I decided to try it, as I&#x27;ve noticed over the years my eyelashes are getting sparser.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I wipe it off with a makeup remover then add more and when I get up</li>
      <li>I will continue to use it because the appearance is better.  </li>
      <li>and yes, my lashes do look longer :) but no change in thickness at all.</li>
      <li>I just bought more of the lash serum</li>
      <li>I will definitely continue using this awesome product!!!</li>
      <li>I simply love using this eyelash boosting serum.  </li>
      <li>It is working ok but not like reviewers rated.</li>
      <li>I put it on top and underneath both top and bottom lashes.  </li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;Not the cheapest but also not the most experience out in the market</li>
      <li>its sooo much more in the stores.</li>
      <li>I also used it on my eyebrows and they grew too :)</li>
      <li>OK, let me start by saying-</li>
      <li>It just seems almost magical.</li>
      <li>😊 would give 5 stars if the packaging was better..</li>
      <li>I just figured id share my experience before I purchased it again ! :)</li>
      <li>I mostly use before going to bed.</li>
      <li>so I started again and they improved once more.</li>
      <li>I only apply at night and have wonderful results!</li>
      <li>I love it .</li>
      <li>As a result I have fuller longer lashes and thicker more fuller eyebrows.</li>
      <li>I have used it for months and am pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>I noticed that they&#x27;re look thicker and more plentiful, though still notmuch longer on the bottom.</li>
      <li>Maybe more time using it will tell.  </li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>I feel so sexy now.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anna</li>
      <li>bought some more.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t put mascara on top unless I&#x27;m going</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best of all similar products you can buy.</li>
      <li>To me, the most noticeable improvement has been to my eyebrows.</li>
      <li>so glad I did.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t even use mascara now most days.</li>
      <li>for about 10 bucks this worked better than revitalash and maybe better than lilash.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad that I gave this product</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m so pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t figure out why so many think this stuff is</li>
      <li>LOVE the results, and the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This stuff really works.  I had tried another brand for several months in vain and almost didn&#x27;t want to spend the extra money to try this without a guarantee.  Was I ever happily surprised when I started to see tiny little black specks beginning to grow.  And they grew and grew!</li>
    <li> I too am a BzzAgent.  I got the serum a little while ago, and I really like the mascara and undercoat, but I do find the serum a little gooey.  I have used it and it does seem like my lashes are a little bit stronger/thicker, but not as much as I&#x27;d like.  I also found it hard to apply any sort of eyeliner while using the serum.  With all that said, this product is cheaper (and seemingly less harmful because it&#x27;s not a prescription) than the other options.  I will continue to use it, but probably won&#x27;t use the serum twice a day.</li>
    <li> I bought this several weeks ago and used it diligently. There has been no positive results. It leaves a creamy film on your lashes and cannot be used right before applying mascara. I was really disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried 2 brands of eyelash growth conditioners so far, and I found that results from them were apparant right after I had been using them for 12 weeks.  I&#x27;m thinking that this may be a more reasonable time frame to use for determining if they are going to work.    I saw results from using it, at the end of the 3rd month.  That&#x27;s 12 weeks of applying it at night, and once in a while in the mornings.    I was shocked when I realized that I had an extra row of lashes growing in, and they were getting really nice and long.  And fuller.  I really had not expected any of these type products to work.    I have applied it underneath mascara, and it is fine; it doesn&#x27;t have any negetive effect on the application of the mascara.  I just let it dry for a few minutes before I apply the mascara.    I use the Lash Serum only; I don&#x27;t buy their Lash Boosting System.  Just the serum, only.    This tube will likely last me a year.   And it does not sting.  At all.  Not even when I get it in my eye.    The applicator is kind of like a thin curved soft strip of sponge, on the end of the wand.  Very soft and comfortable to apply directly to the eyelashes, and both upper and lower lids where you would apply eyeliner.  And seriously, it did take all of 3 months before they just took off and started growing.  ****    I have a tube of Mavala Eye-Lite Double Cils - $10 - I have not tested it yet, but I can tell you that it does not sting if you get it in your eyes.    I remove my eye makeup at night with vasoline.  I don&#x27;t wash that off, I only tissue it off.  I&#x27;m sure it conditions the eye lashes a little bit too.    And finally, a few days ago I bought Rimmel Lash Accelerator Mascara With Grow Lash Complex.  I like it very much.  It lengthens my lashes like L&#x27;Oreal Lash Out does, only better.  I can sweep the mascara upwards on my top lashes, and they will curve up and stay there nicely.</li>
    <li> I have to admit that I didn&#x27;t expect this to work. It just seemed so far fetched. I&#x27;ve taken all kinds of supplements including Biotin and none of them worked even a little bit. But I got this almost free so what the heck? First, I have to stress that I did not use this every night. It came with the mascara with I didn&#x27;t use at all (it was summer and I almost never wear makeup because it melts right off). I kept it on my nightstand and intended to use it every night, but I only remembered every 2-3 nights a week. After three weeks I noticed that my tweezers were getting caught up in my lashes while I was plucking my brows. They were definitely longer, but I didn&#x27;t notice any thickening. I continued to use it until it ran out (which was about 4 months). It did not dry up or cause any irritation. Now my lashes are much longer AND thicker. I&#x27;m thrilled with the results, and have just started tube #2 and I&#x27;m recommending it to every woman I know. I often wonder how it works. It just seems almost magical.</li>
    <li> I have tried couple different products but this one works for me. I used one to two times a day for 1 month. I see the result gradually. The upper lashes were longer and the lower lashes got longer as well, as the serum got onto it.</li>
    <li> I like this product. No miracles, but it worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it diligently twice a day for 3 and a half weeks now. My lashes got a bit longer, I also had almost no lashes at the outer corners of my eyes, now I see they started regrowing. I used the serum on my eye brows too,but yet haven&#x27;t noticed any difference. I ordered another tube. I think it is a descent item and the price is affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes, for first couple of days I could feel slight burning after applying the product, but it disappeared quite quickly. Also in the morning I find those white thingies on my eyelashes and eye brows, but they are easily removed with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very satisfied with the product and will continue using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to find a product that was good for my eyelashes! Before I would try and use other household things to see what could make them healthier but I&#x27;m glad they finally made something good for your eyelashes &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product once a night for almost 2 weeks, didn&#x27;t expect much but thought i would give it a try. Woke up this morning after 2 weeks of use and noticed a difference, my lashes looked longer! Actually noticable... Thought maybe it might be a little bit of my imagination, however, when i got to work one of my coworkers started commenting on how long my lashes were, i hadn&#x27;t told her about using the product. I&#x27;m excited to see how this will continue! 2 weeks ladies.. really!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I have sparse short eye lases and after using this product they are longer, thicker, and full!  I am on my third tube and plan to continue this product.  I only apply at night and have wonderful results!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a whole bunch of products over the years that \\&quot;guaranteed\\&quot; my lashes would be thicker, longer, stronger, better, etc -- but I&#x27;ve always been let down in the end because the products didn&#x27;t work any better than every other product I had tried in the past. Well, I recently got my hands on a tube of this for Free to try out through a site called BzzAgent which honestly is the only reason I decided to try it, because to be real with you I had decided I would NOT spend any more money on these kind of products when they really didn&#x27;t work for me in the past. Let me tell you, after using the serum now for about 4 weeks I am sooo happy to say that it really really does work just like they said it would. I was surprised to find that my lashes were noticeably thicker even without mascara and they just seemed somehow stronger -- less breakage when I took my mascara off and things like that. I would for sure recommend at least giving this product a try to see if it works for you like it did for me because I&#x27;ve found that I wear mascara less now because of how healthy my eyelashes look. The best thing I think I can say to really let everyone know how good L&#x27;oreal Lash boost works is to say that after all the stuff I&#x27;ve tried this is the ONLY product for lashes that I would ever tell my mom or my best friend to go buy. Hope you love it too! :-)    -K</li>
    <li> Recently, I received the opportunity to try the L&#x27;Oreal lash serum through BzzAgent.    [See my before and after pics here: [...]    The serum promises to deliver fortified, nourished and strengthened lashes with daily use. The mascara promises longer, thicker, fuller lashes. Apply the serum to bare lashes, at night, and during the day under your mascara.    Well I have been testing this product for about a month now and the results are in!  Does it deliver? YES!    Before using the L&#x27;Oreal Lash serum, my lashes were very short and brittle. I noticed a difference in the first few days of use! My lashes already seemed longer and fuller. I also noticed less lashes falling out.    I was most impressed with the how my lashes look now, even when I haven&#x27;t applied the serum or mascara.    These products are ophthalmologist and allergy-tested, and are safe for sensitive eyes and contact lens wearers!</li>
    <li> I tried this product through BzzAgent. I was surprised how well it worked. After 2 weeks of using this product twice a day, I can notice my lower eye lashes are alot fuller and thicker. I love that it is easy to apply.     I did take one star off since I did have some minor eye irratition a few times. Now I make sure to only apply a little bit at a time.     Overall, I&#x27;m very please with this product and will continue to use it regularly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month now figuring I would give it one month before making a final decision on the product.  What I&#x27;ve noticed is after the first few days I had some minor eye irratitation..almost like a small sty on the bottom lid of my eye.  It only lasted a day, but was there nonetheless.  I also used only this product on my eyes for 2 weeks.  No mascara at all...just this product.  After the two weeks of using night and day, I decided to test the mascara.  WOW!  My lashes are much longer and fuller on the top and much, much fuller and longer on the bottom.  I now use this product underneath my mascara in the morning withouth any issues and my eyelashas are amazing.  I admit that I haven&#x27;t used any other lash boosting product so I can&#x27;t compare, but at this price and the way it works, I won&#x27;t be looking for another!</li>
    <li> I have been working in the beauty industry for 2 1/2 years and I have been looking for a product just like this serum.  I have been to sephora and tried all different types of brands that claim that they will help to grow and thicken lashes and none of them have done what they claimed to do.  However, I got a coupon in the mail for this serum and had to try it.  I think I purchased it for around 20 dollars and it is well worth it.  I have been using the product for about a week and I can already see the results... its crazy!  I didn&#x27;t think that it would be affective but my lashes look healthier, longer, and thicker.  What is so crazy is that I am supposed to see the best results in 4 weeks... with the way they look right now... I can only imagine what they will look like when I get to the 4th week.  The product is easy to apply and I use it day and night :)  Some people say that they have eye irritation but I have not had any problems or complaints about the product.  I will definitely continue using this awesome product!!!</li>
    <li> I received this product free to try from Bzz Agent, a word-of-mouth marketing company.  I have been using it for 3 weeks and have noticed no improvement in the thickness, length, or density of my lashes.  Looking at the ingredients, there is nothing in this product which will impact lash growth.  I diligently use those types of products, and they work great, and are much more expensive due to the cost of the active ingredients.  I will continue to be faithful to L&#x27;Oreal mascaras because they are superior and affordable, but I would suggest not spending your money on this serum, and saving up to purchase a product that delivers noticeable results.</li>
    <li> I have lashes that are long in the center and short on the sides, and stick straight. I only recently started wearing mascara every day, and found that my lashes were falling out. I received L&#x27;Oreal Lash Serum for free as part of a marketing trial, and was super skeptical it would do anything, but decided to give this product a shot.  I have never tried Latisse, but after using this serum for three months -- my lashes look like the \\&quot;After\\&quot; pic in the Latisse ads. But -- it took a while. The directions say to apply morning and night, and that you&#x27;ll see results after 30 days. It took me a while to get into that routine -- for a month, I skipped days a lot. Even now I only remember to apply it in the morning.    Yet, after 30 days, I noticed much less lash fall out.    After 60 days, my lashes looked noticeably thicker, and NO lash fallout.    After about 90 days, my lashes are both thicker AND longer on the sides! I&#x27;ve been getting comments from friends and coworkers all week, and that&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve decided to submit this review (it&#x27;s also on Makeup Alley). I usually don&#x27;t write any! My 90 days of the Lash Serum was probably equivalent to 30-45 days of being diligent about applying the serum daily, both day/night.    So in summary, L&#x27;Oreal Lash Serum works, but it takes patience and discipline to get the big results. For one bottle retailing at $14, and a little discipline, the results are pretty amazing. I strongly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> When I first bought this, I used it regularly and as directed. After about 2 weeks, I dropped off to only using it once at night. I can&#x27;t say that this made my lashes longer or fuller, what it did do was make them appear healthier which gives them the appearance of being longer &amp; fuller. My lashes weren&#x27;t overly short before but they came out often, sometimes they just didn&#x27;t want to cooperate with mascara &amp; would criss cross over each other, etc. While using this product I noticed less lashes falling out, and mascara glided on with all my lashes cooperating &amp; staying straight. Also, by having less lashes falling out, I assume this does help in making them fuller. I stopped using it for awhile &amp; my lashes went back to the way they were before so I started again and they improved once more. This convinced me and I am now a regular user! I have noticed some complaints of the product gooping on their lashes. I apply just one swipe on my lashes, no more. I don&#x27;t have any problem. I also have sensitive eyes and I am a contact lens wearer &amp; this has not caused me irritation.</li>
    <li> I have short barely there lashes and after month of use.....my lashes are fuller, longer and look healthier. My husband even noticed that my lashes are definitely longer. This product does what it says it would do and for a very very good price.</li>
    <li> The Spa I went to suggested the use of Latisse for longer, fuller lashes.  But then I saw this product at my local store and I decided to try it.  There is a considerable difference in my lashes even without being consistent.  I forget to where it twice a day as suggested and sometimes skip days. I wear it alone without mascara and my eyes still pop!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the serum and double extend mascara for about 8-9 months now.  I admit I have not used the serum religiously.  It seems to help keep my lashes softer.  I finally noticed after 8-9 months that my lashes do look longer!  I think alternating between the double extend mascara and another brand helped me see the difference.  The double extend mascara was more of an immediate gratification (and got me a lot of compliments on my lashes appearance to have extensions).  The serum took me until now to notice the difference.  I will definitely keep using both.</li>
    <li> I already have pretty, long curly eyelashes, but a girl can never have too many! I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 days, at night when I go to bed and in the morning when I&#x27;m putting on my makeup. THIS PRODUCT WORKS! (for me at least). I could easily grow my eyelashes to my eyebrows using this product, but I don&#x27;t want to do that because they would look fake. This product works too well, so I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy more of it, but I&#x27;ll recommend it to people who have short eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----------Update: 9/11/2012---------&lt;br /&gt;I bought some more. On my second bottle! I&#x27;m in love with this stuff.</li>
    <li> I just gave 1 star..I would of given 0 stars if it would let me....It was a gift for my mom and when she received it the product was not in a package like showen,,it was loose and she said it had been used...How gross..I was embarrsed and My mom was sad she wanted it so bad...And the company makes it difficult to return so never ordering on line again way better to trust stores!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a while now and waited a long time to give a review so i could be fair. this product did not change my eyelashes at all. don&#x27;t waste your time and money. look for something else.</li>
    <li> Having had short and brittle lashes my whole life, I tried the L&#x27;Oreal Double Extend lash Boosting Serum.  After 2 weeks of use, my lashes are noticeably fuller, longer, and most importantly, stronger.  My lashes don&#x27;t fall off when I remove my mascara, which is great.  It&#x27;s easy to use and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes (which are very sensitive and easily susceptible to conjunctivitis).  The only negative, though, is that the wand can get pretty disgusting.  I&#x27;ve had to clean/sterilize a few times, and it&#x27;s very important to use the product on clean lashes only.  All in all, this is an economical alternative to the pricier products out there.</li>
    <li> I bought the Loreal Lash Serum and the combination Lash Serum Mascura a year ago when it first came out. I thought with the price and the promises the company made about this product, it would not live up. I used the serum every few days or when I felt like it only on my top lashes. I didn&#x27;t see a difference b/c I didn&#x27;t have anything to compare to and did not use the serum everyday. I recently started using the serum every night and started applying it to my lower lashes, which I barely have except for a few strands for the sake of \\&quot;Why not? What can I lose?\\&quot; Long story short. I now have noticeable longer lower lashes and that is a miracle.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an Okay Subsitute to Rapid Lash, the cost is significantly lower, my only reason for going with this this product, was b/c Rapid Lash was no longer available :-(. When it&#x27;s on, your lashes appear fuller, as far as growth, it&#x27;s has been minimal.</li>
    <li> I hated this product, I thought it would at least just make my lashes softer.  No, it made them shorter!  After I started using it my lashes began to break off.  They became MUCH shorter then they were before using this serum.  I hated the applicator too, it was a pain to use.  I guess the ingredients in this product were a poor match for me.  I started using a different product (cheaper then this stuff) and my lashes are improving...finally!</li>
    <li> This product ONLY makes your eyelashes stronger which causes them to fall out less. It DOES NOT lengthen lashes. L&#x27;Oreal even states this on their website. I used 3 bottles of this with everyday use and my lashes looked fuller, but were not longer. After I stopped using it, the lashes reverted back to exactly how they were before I used this product. If you have the money, you can keep using it, but it will be a lifelong decision.</li>
    <li> It does not work for me at all.&lt;br /&gt;I used the entire bottle and my eyelash did not grow longer or fuller&lt;br /&gt;Not the cheapest but also not the most experience out in the market but I was really looking for a good result and I didn&#x27;t see it at all!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B002PBJIPK L&#x27;Oreal Double Extend Lash Boosting Serum]] I actually tried this product twice. Once by itself and the 2nd time it came with the [[ASIN:B002PBK1EM L&#x27;Oreal Double Extend Lash Boosting Mascara - Blackest Black]]. Both times I used the serum every evening for over 6 weeks, and the extended mascara during the day but only about a week and did not see any results either time.  The boosting mascara has 2 parts; mascara on one end and what I thought was just another boosting serum on the other.  Turns out it is loaded with small fibers that attach to your lashes and when you apply the mascara, gives the appearance of longer lashes.  Pretty much like any other lengthening mascara, except they made it separate.  Unfortunately, for anyone with sensitive eyes, like myself, those fibers are extremely irritating.  So I did not continue using the mascara.  Regardless, the product did not work for me after 2 attempts.</li>
    <li> I have to say that I was skeptical at first when I saw this product, but decided to give it a try, as my lashes were thin and sparse and had a habit of falling out.  But after using it (it&#x27;s been about a year now that I&#x27;ve been using it), I have to say that my lashes are thicker and longer and no longer fall out as much (you do still get the occasional ones that fall out).  I do feel that this is a product that you must use all the time to keep up with the results, but is it worth it?  For thicker, longer lashes, it sure is!</li>
    <li> Much as i hate to admit it, iam older and just beginning menopause. My lashes have been deteriorating for a couple of years now. not to mention my hair &amp; eyebrows. I am a VERY busy professional so i only used the product sporadically and STILL within 3 wks i noticed a difference in the length &amp; fullness of my lashes. it has not helped the blondish grey color any, but a little mascara and poof! am now experimenting on a single section of eyebrow. will keep you posted. those i can always have dyed.    experimenting on my 16 yr old as well. ;]</li>
    <li> Bought this with high hopes but not really expecting much.  Been using for almost a month and am pleasantly surprised with the results. My lash lashes are longer and thicker. Its not overly dramatic but it is noticeable. Results exceeded my expectations for a nonprescription, under $10 product. I plan to continue to use it.</li>
    <li> this item came as it was stated &amp; described and the delivery was quick &amp; it came in good condition this works to keep your eyelashes conditioned</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a good 6 months now and I have definitely noticed my lashes fall out less. I have also used Lilash and Rapid Lash, while I have achieved greatest lengthening and fullness with Lilash, my lashes fell out with both the products while I was using them. I only wish my eyelashes are fuller with the L&#x27;Oreal product, I am satisfied with the length and the strength of my lashes, but if they are fuller, my lashes would be spectacular.     I have noticed a good deal of variation in results with eye lash growth products...it works for some people and not others and the effects are different with the same product on different people. L&#x27;Oreal Lash Boosting Serum is cheap enough and it is definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> One of my housemates tried it and was pretty happy with the results, but I was still skeptical.  I decided to do a little experiment to see if it worked or not- apply it to one eye and not the other.  I started two and a half weeks ago, and I can see the difference between my two eyes- one of my friends asked if I was wearing mascara on just one eye.  I don&#x27;t think it makes your eyelashes dramatically longer, but I&#x27;m really pleased with how full they are.    I have very sensitive skin, and I did have some burning/itching one night when I used it.  The package says to use it like mascara and liner- if I only apply it like mascara then I don&#x27;t have any irritation.</li>
    <li> I tried this product to see if I could get some results like I&#x27;d gotten with Rapid Lash.  (I was looking for a cheaper alternative.)  However, this product did nothing for my lashes or brows.  In addition, the brush is weird and the product stings a little, so be careful not to actually get it in your eyes!</li>
    <li> I am amazed with this product. I had lash extensions for my wedding. The lashes looked great but pulled my own lashes out. I lost about half my lashes, which made me panic and I was going to invest in a very expensive lash boosting product called lilash. I naturally have very short lashes and had used lilash in the past, unfortunately I could not afford to spend 100 bucks, so I was trying to find a temporary way to condition my lashes. I have used this product for 1 week and notice that my lashes are already almost back to normal. So I am very impressed.</li>
    <li> I used it every day for a month. I did not notice any changes in the length or thickness of my lashes. It does not contain the key ingredient (I didn&#x27;t know about it before I bought this) pentapeptide-17. I used a different product containing it and in 3 weeks I saw some of my lashes were about 3 millimeters longer. Lush Lash from Urban Decay worked but it is three times as expensive. I guess you get what you paid for.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews on this before I purchased it and I admit I was skeptical about it \\&quot;really\\&quot; working..Especially for such a low price! But after only using this for 3 short weeks! I&#x27;m already seeing amazing results!!!..The lashes on my right eye have always been longer and thicker than my left but now my my lashes on my left eye look just as Amazing as my right!!!..I&#x27;m really impressed with the incredible results that I&#x27;ve seen after only 3 weeks!...Also this product is very gentle on the eyes!...I&#x27;ve not experience any stinging or any other side effects!...I&#x27;m glad that I gave this product a try b/c it&#x27;s worth it&#x27;s price and more!!!</li>
    <li> I use this at night with rapid lash. I think with the combo together I have gotten awesome results. I haven&#x27;t used it on it&#x27;s own tho.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t give this product five stars because sometimes I get a little irritation with it and sometimes it makes white flakes on my eyelashes. Neither of those issues has been serious enough for me to even consider giving this stuff up. I&#x27;ve been using it now for about two years and I&#x27;m so pleased with the results. It has made my lashes longer and thicker and I have much less fallout. I can&#x27;t remember the last time I got an eyelash stuck in my eye. The Avon lady at work asked what kind of mascara I was using-she thought I was wearing mascara and she wanted me to switch to one of her products. I assured her I was not wearing mascara, just the eyelash serum. She was amazed. The product might not be for everyone-as I said, it can be irritating at times and you may get some flakes now and then. But for the price, it&#x27;s worth a try. I started seeing results in a couple of weeks, and after a couple of months, my lashes were as long and thick as when I was a kid. Definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for one month now, following the instructions and have gotten absolutely no results. My lashes do not appear fuller, thicker or longer. Also, I occasionally skipped the morning application (rarely though) because mascara does not go over it easily, my lashes looked thin and stiff if I applied the serum first. I would not recommend purchasing this product. I plan to use it for another month to see if any results show and if so I will change my review. However, Im doubtful.</li>
    <li> I have been trying this product for two weeks from BZZAGENT and I love it. I have lost fewer lashes and they look thicker. The serum is great, the mascara makes me look like like I&#x27;ve used a lash curler. I do wish the lash conditioner wasn&#x27;t white - sometimes I have to use two coats of mascara to cover it.</li>
    <li> I am a recovering chemo patient, and at the time of ordering this product I had no eyelashes.  I&#x27;m not sure what product made the difference as I also combined it with the RapidLash Eyelash &amp; Eyebrow Enhancing Serum.  All I can say that after about a week of using both products I began to see a major difference and started not only growing eyelashes, but eyebrows as well.</li>
    <li> I am very carful what I buy in the line of eye makeup, there are a lot of choices out there and I want to spend my money wisely.  I saw the lash serum at Target so decided since my lashes were so short, to give it a try.  I used it every morning and evening for a month. . . . nothing.  It was like I was putting nothing on my lashes but white stuff.  It costs me almost $13. which was very depressing since I could of had a mascara or new color shadow.  I wouldn&#x27;t spend my money on a product like this again.  But look at the ingredients, there is nothing in this product that grows anything except remorse for spending the money.</li>
    <li> i had been worrying about the number of lashes i noticed falling out when i removed my makeup for a while, so when this came out i decided to give it a try. i was skeptical that it would actually work, but after just a couple of weeks using it, i did notice that i had much fewer lashes falling out. i haven&#x27;t noticed any change in the length or thickness of my lashes, but since it did what i bought it for, i do really like this product.</li>
    <li> I really like this serum, along with my long term product is helping grow my lashes beautifully. I am using for only one week and already seeing results.&lt;br /&gt;xo</li>
    <li> OK, let me start by saying- i dont have much of an issue with my lashes to begin with, they are a nice length and pretty thick, but because i am a natural blonde they tend to be light in color. I figured hey, why not give this product a try and see if it gives me a little boost so i dont have to always wear mascara. :P i have only been using this product for ONE WEEK, and im already seeing an increase in the volume of my lashes, and do my eyes deceive me, or do they look a little longer too? im not sure if this product makes them grow, but they do seem a little longer. i have been using this product on my eyes and nothing else. Not even mascara. I find that putting mascara on over it is a little rough, and redundant in a way since this product almost acts like a clear mascara, and i like how it makes my lashes look. i have not had any irritation or discomfort at all. i just put a little on in the morning and then at night, as instructed...but after these results in just one week, i may just do it once a day.</li>
    <li> My eyelashes were falling out on one eye and after 1.5 months they grew back. They are a little bit thicker and longer but I think it will take months to grow they way I want them.</li>
    <li> lots of things change as we age, lashes thin and break off from dryness. I noticed that my lashes actually felt prickly,from how brittle they had become, due,not only from aging , but health ,medications , and diet.&lt;br /&gt;The timing for finding LOreals Lash Serum was perfect for me. I have been wearing makeup since I was 14yrs old and my eyelashes nowin my 50s were so brittle and short that I could no longer wear mascara!&lt;br /&gt;Since using this product my lashes are back,long, and silky. I think L Oreal should have named it Miacle Grow for lashes.</li>
    <li> I am currently using Latisse and don&#x27;t need to use mascara. However, since my lashes are so long, they need to be combed. I bought this product to do that and coat them so they stay in place and have a shine to them. I expected it to have an applicator brush - it doesn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s a curved piece of plastic. The product does coat my lashes and make them shiny, but I have to use an eyelash brush to separate my lashes - a bit of a hassle. If you&#x27;re looking for a brush applicator, as I was, look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> This is one of the first eyelash products I ever purchased. I used it faithfully. Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> This product does seem to work if I apply it at night before bed but when I tried to apply it as it also recommends, before my mascara, it actually made my lashes clump together terribly, making them look worse.</li>
    <li> It is my first time to use this product. It works well but I find it is cheaper if I buy the combination with a mascara.</li>
    <li> It is working ok but not like reviewers rated. Disappointed but glad that I didn&#x27;t pay a high price for it.</li>
    <li> Disappointing.  Tried drug store  cheap brands that worked better and thought this would be better because it was L&#x27;Oreal and more expensive, but ...Not.</li>
    <li> I bought this almost three months ago because my eyelashes were sparse due to wearing extensions for several months. And I had the extensions put on because my lashes had thinned and shortened with middle age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I ordered some false eyelashes here on Amazon to carry me until my lashes grew back, and I saw this L&#x27;Oreal Lash Boosting Serum and thought, &amp;#34;What the heck?&amp;#34; It&#x27;s cheap and doesn&#x27;t have any weird medication in it like that other stuff people are using these days. So I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I used it twice a day, morning before makeup and night time after cleansing. A few times my eyelid got a little itchy, so I cut use down to once every day or two, at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My lashes started growing back pretty well, so I thought &amp;#34;how can I tell if it was the Serum or just natural?&amp;#34; Well now  I do believe that the Serum is working because my eyelashes are longer now than they were originally! Bonus! Now, if they could figure out a Serum for thinning head hair that isn&#x27;t pharmaceutical, that would make someone very rich!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, if you have lash growth issues, go ahead and try this, what the hey - it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
    <li> I have naturally long lashes, but what I was looking for was more lashes and thicker fuller lashes, and I got it almost instantly!  After using the product for just a couple days I noticed new lash growth, and thicker lashes.  After continued use, my lashes got longer, thicker, and fuller then before!  It was even noticeable to others.  I&#x27;m also usually quite sensitive, and I didn&#x27;t notice any real burning... just a little but extremely tolerable and barely noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not use masacara, only on my bare lashes, once before bed and once in the morning.  I love this product, what a great buy, and for a great price too!  Highly recommended.  :)</li>
    <li> I ve been using it for a month and I can tell my lashes are longer and thicker ,it s a good buy for the price but I wouldn&#x27;t compare it with lattesse or other professional products ,it doesn&#x27;t make a huge difference but result is still noticeable.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m 21 and my lashes are medium length. i started using this serum so i can rely less on mascara for thickening/lengthening my lashes since mascara isn&#x27;t healthy for your lashes. i have been using it for 2 months now and yes, my lashes do look longer :) but no change in thickness at all. i&#x27;m going to continue using it but haven&#x27;t decided if i&#x27;ll buy it again once i run out</li>
    <li> It works! More than I expected.</li>
    <li> I simply love using this eyelash boosting serum.  It really works wonders</li>
    <li> I had a bad experience with this product. It has a very &amp;#34;gluely&amp;#34; texture and it wound up clogging my tear ducts. I had to go through some real misery trying to get my eyes normalized--went to irritation and constant tearing and finally after treatment was able to unclog the ducts.  Be careful with this. It created a serious problem for me. Thank you to Amazon for refunding the money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product to try to save money and bottom line, you get what you pay for! It has not lengthened or thickened or \\&quot;enhanced\\&quot; my lashes at all during the last 2 months.  I had been using RapidLash for almost a year which added length to my very short and sparse lashes but at $50 a tube, I wanted to try something less costly.  I will be going back to RapidLash since this did not work for me.</li>
    <li> Been using the lashboosting system day and night as instructed, for 3 weeks now. I use it on both brows and lashes, and both appeared smoother and fuller after one week actually. I have straight pale lashes naturally, which appear to be fuller and more \\&quot;curved\\&quot; now. Not really longer(at this point) but thicker and shinier. No problems applying product, it goes on easy. Will probably keep using it!</li>
    <li> I use this before bed on all my lashes. Might be the placebo effect but I have liked my lashes recently. I probably should&#x27;ve taken a before pic so I know whether the product itself is working ): I&#x27;ll go through the tube and see how things go, but so far, I&#x27;m thinking it better than using nothing at all!</li>
    <li> comparing to the other product that I also purchased in Amazon, Ardell Brown and Lash Growth accelerator, this product seems to perform a poorer result. Not really satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using for approximately 1 week and already I have tons of new lashes! Incredible.  I mostly use before going to bed.</li>
    <li> Been using it twice a day for almost 2 weeks now and it feels great.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply. Doesn&#x27;t sting.&lt;br /&gt;A while after the coating is dried, it&#x27;s gonna peel and leave you with lashes looking like it catches dust.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell that it helps with eyelash growth at this point.  Maybe more time using it will tell.  I can&#x27;t really recommend it at this time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had short lashes which would always fall out or break. I&#x27;ve been using the product for a few months now and I&#x27;ve noticed my lashes haven&#x27;t fallen out or broken off. I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised with my longer lashes (but they&#x27;re not any thicker). I&#x27;ve started using some other products and will let you know how those work out but for the price and availability of L&#x27;Oreal it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> I have really long lashes, the problem is that they are not thick and they are also stick-straight.  I thought I&#x27;d try this because it wasn&#x27;t too bad of a price.  I didn&#x27;t know if the serum would last a whole month, but there is more than enough!    I also have really sensitive eyes; mascara irritates them especially if I wear it all day, and I have to use certain makeup removers so my eyes don&#x27;t burn afterwards...    This stuff not only made my lashes completely thicker, but my eyes weren&#x27;t even slightly irritated!  I put this on morning and night and I&#x27;ve notice a huge difference - my lashes are much more noticeable and thicker.    It really is convenient to use - you just apply it like mascara and you can still wear your eye makeup over it.  It does leave a sort of stringy goo but I only notice it when I rub my eyes.    All in all, this is a great buy especially for the price.  You are saving so much money using this instead of getting a doctor-prescribed lash booster, and there&#x27;s no scary side effects like eye discoloration and irritation.  It&#x27;s worth it to give it a try, and as long as you stick with it and make it a habit, you will see results!</li>
    <li> The package was broken when I received the boosting serum and it seemed like very old. I dont know if I use it or not.</li>
    <li> For the price, I don&#x27;t see how you can go wrong with this lash serum unless you don&#x27;t have the patience to wait a few weeks for results. I had actually been considering learning how to apply my own lash extensions when I found this on Amazon and decided to try this instead. I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 or 4 weeks and I can definitely see an increase in the length of my lashes. I usually use it once a day. I like the way it darkens my lashes and holds them up with a slight curl. I don&#x27;t put mascara on top unless I&#x27;m going somewhere special cause my lashes look pretty nice without it. When I do go out I just use mascara w/o serum and put some serum on after removing my makeup before I go to bed. This is the only serum I&#x27;ve tried so I can&#x27;t compare it to any others but I am happy with the results of this L&#x27;Oreal product. When you put on your mascara you will really notice how your eyelashes pop after a few weeks of using this on a regular basis. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the rare occasions when my eyelids itch slightly. Sometimes if you touch your lashes some of the product can feel a little rubbery like dry rubber cement. These are completely minor issues compared to having nicer than ever lashes for just a few dollars and a little patience with the process. I think it also thickens the base of my lashes giving a sort of natural looking \\&quot;eyeliner\\&quot; effect which I really like.</li>
    <li> I love this, I saw results very quickly. Love it! !</li>
    <li> My right side eyelashes were beautiful but my lashes on my left side were broken (oh no!) BUT I purchased this serum and now I have to apply it on both sides :) my left side eyelashes grew back in only a matter of days and they were thick and beautiful! I reccomend this product if you want to grow your lashes quickly. I also used it on my eyebrows and they grew too :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my 3rd day using it and I love it! This little thing I&#x27;ll pop out you eyelashes! I have noticed improvement! + if you put it before your mascara it looks way better!</li>
    <li> This just didn&#x27;t work for me at all.  It&#x27;s easy to apply and didn&#x27;t cause any eye irritation but it also made absolutely no difference in my eyelashes.</li>
    <li> This serum really does work. I have used it before, but stopped using after a while. Then I noticed my eyelashes were looking thinner so I ordered it again. In just one day I noticed my lashes were thicker. It&#x27;s been less than a week and I noticed my lashes are longer now, too. On one eye my lashes are longer than the other eye, so I apply less to that eye to even things out. I can&#x27;t wait to see how great my lashes look after a month! Amazon is also cheaper than my local drugstore, it was 13 dollars there-plus tax. I give it 4 stars because in the morning, when I apply mascara this makes it a little more clumpy. I have to use an eyelash comb to get the clumps out, but that&#x27;s my only complaint.</li>
    <li> As I aged, I knew that my hair would turn gray (it is), I would develop facial wrinkles (I have), and that my bewbs would sneak South (no comment); however, no one told me that my eyelashes would become shorter and finer, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;You have got to be freaking kidding me!\\&quot; I finally exclaimed last month, and at the age of 43 I was faced with the first sign of aging that has really upset me.  Ever since I was a child I have had long eyelashes.  People used to comment on them all the time, even going as far as to suggest I was wearing false eyelashes.  But when I have been looking in the mirror for the past year my eyelashes have begun to look like like, well, old lady eyelashes.  When I put on mascara, in place of being rewarded with long, flowing blinkers I was instead confronted with the stark reality that I looked as if I belonged to the Joan Van Ark Mascara Hot Mess Club.  I had black spikes poking out and around two confused and cynical green orbs in a manner that was, well, not flattering in the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three weeks ago I purchased L&#x27;Oreal Lash Boosting Serum with minimal expectations, and I have begun to see results.  Yesterday, for the first time, I noticed that my eyelashes are beginning to look like they did ten years ago; they are definitely longer, and they are not falling out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have begun to apply the lash serum to my eyebrows to see if it works on them as well, and I will report back in the next couple of weeks with my results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only other note I have for any prospective buyers is that there is one aspect of this product that you might want to watch out for: if you use it in the morning before you put on your makeup, it will cause your mascara, your eyeliner, and your eyeshadow to peel off.  The peeling happens when I apply mascara, though, and it is a bit of a nuisance.  I sometimes have to use a thin pair of tweezers to pull the excess off my lashes or lids, and then I have to reapply my eyeshadow or liner.  This is a small issue, however, considering the benefits of the last serum.  (Nor does it sting my eyes when it has gotten into them...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this serum to anyone with thinning lashes.  I would also like to comment that I have been using it twice daily on my lids, lashes, and brows for three weeks, and I have only used around five percent of the tube.  I believe this tube will last me four or five months in the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for reading my review.  Best wishes to any of you looking for longer lashes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE, AS Of NOVEMBER, 2013:&lt;br /&gt;I started using this product only in the evening, after taking my makeup off or washing my face, six weeks after writing this review.  My lashes are still long, and they still grow in well.  This past summer, I was making pita pockets via the recipe from the Game of Thrones Cookbook (Inn at the Crossroads).  When putting one pocket on the bread stone in our oven, I burned my face, because the oven was set to over 500 degrees Fahrenheit.  Later that night, when I took off my mascara, my eyelashes came off with it.  Yes, I burned my eyelashes off.  For two months I wore false eyelashes, and I used this product three times a day.  By August, my lashes had grown completely back, and still long at that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a once-a-day application, I am able to retain lashes that are close to one centimeter long with mascara.  This product has worked very well for me over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE, AS OF AUGUST, 2014:&lt;br /&gt;I just wanted to check in to say that I have been using this product once daily for two years now.  My lashes have remained long and full.  I am sold.is is a small issue, however, considering the benefits of the last serum.

    <li> Really didn&#x27;t show much in terms of improvement in lash length, but I must say my lashes were a little thicker after 2 packages.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best of all similar products you can buy.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product as part of my nightly routine for the past three months and I have to say it is great. I got results after a month of using it. Not only do I use it on my lashes but I also use it on my eyebrows and works on both! As a result I have fuller longer lashes and thicker more fuller eyebrows. Great product and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Had this product about 4 years ago ! I must say the product worked quiet well for me. I would use the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Double Extend Lash Boosting Mascara, along with this product. My eyelashes were really getting long until I stopped using the product and turned to false lashes. I would apply the serum allow it to dry, then I would apply step 1 of my loreal mascara and let this sit for a few hours before applying my step 2. I would do that everyday even putting it on at night. I just figured id share my experience before I purchased it again ! :)</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see much difference after using it.</li>
    <li> My lashes became visibly longer, maybe because it stopped them from breaking but whatever the reason, it worked. I also managed to grow some hair on the tail of my one eyebrow that had no hair, so it OBVIOUSLY WORKS!!!!</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a lash serum for sometime....  Happen to find it in one of my cosmetic draws....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My primary use is for keeping my lashes conditioned... I have extreme dry eyes. Affects my lashes as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Find it does work pretty well under my mascara&#x27;s... Problem now... Can&#x27;t seem to find anymore at my local stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope it has not been discontinued...</li>
    <li> I have been using the lash boosting serum for a little over a week and I have actually missed a couple of days but I do see a difference in my lashes already. Although they are not longer, which I was really hoping they would be, my lashes are starting to get a little thicker. I have a small spot on my top left eyelash line that is a little bare that is less noticeable now. I am hoping that a few more weeks of using the serum will give me even better results. I have very sensitive skin and thankfully have had no irritation so far. I used is as a mascara and as an eyeliner per the directions but when I woke up in the morning I always had a white coat of gunk on my lashes that was very uncomfortable if I rubbed it into my eyes and it did not look good at all if I did not wash it all off and put mascara on top of it. Now I apply a light coat but I just dab the serum on the root line, outlining a little dab at a time until I cover both upper and lower lids. I have not used any other products to compare against but I am definitely happy with this product and for the price it is well worth it.</li>
    <li> It really works on your lashes..making them long, fortified and strong..I will recommend it!! I will buy it again next time.</li>
    <li> First, I&#x27;d like to start this review by saying it seems that beauty products of any sort work for people differently, or not work, because folks are, well, all different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, I had gotten a prescription for the medicinal lash grower, but decided not to use it, because I have very sensitive eyes and read (after getting the prescription) that it can cause major irritation. [However, I have been using that particular product on my eyebrows, and it has worked wonders.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so I started to research products that can grow or improve eyelashes, with no side effects, and I kept reading very positive reviews overall for L&#x27;Oreal Lash Boosting Serum. At approximately $12.00 per tube, I gave it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the product for roughly 4 months, now starting on my third tube, and I can most definitely say that there is a difference with my eyelashes. They are darker, longer and thicker. As a matter of fact, the P.A. who does my facials noticed that my lashes were longer, darker and thicker and asked if I was using the prescription brand, to which I told her my story above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started seeing results right away when using L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s lash booster. It just made my eyelashes look longer and conditioned, sort of like using a conditioner on one&#x27;s hair, my lashes looked healthier. Now, I&#x27;ve always had crazy long, thick eyelashes, but like all things when one gets to be my age (51), your nails, hair, eyelashes, eyebrows, skin texture, etc., are not the same as when you&#x27;re 21. With L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Lash Booster, my eyelashes are looking really nice again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply the product in the morning and in the evening (especially before bedtime), or really anytime after I wash my face. I found that using this product before applying mascara makes my eyelashes almost look like they are false-eyelashes, they get so long !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes this product particularly nice, is that it does not irritate my eyes in the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I highly recommend this product based upon my own experience with using it.</li>
    <li> i like putting this on sometimes, because it&#x27;s a bit of moisturizing for my eye area, but it doesnt do anything to your lashes. the biggest favor i ever did for my eye lashes was to stop wearing mascara, because mascara is what makes lashes fall out. and most of it flakes off and leaves black spots on your under eyes during the day. i dont understand the point of wearing make up that makes you look worse instead of better!</li>
    <li> while I do love this product, on the latest delivery, the packaging was open, then taped. Since it was a product for eyes, I was quite&lt;br /&gt;concerned. I made sure I placed it on my skin on my hands first and waited. Can&#x27;t be too careful. I have never received open&lt;br /&gt;packaging before. Not happy about that, but the product is not compromised - haven&#x27;t experienced any ill effects - yet :)</li>
    <li> After reading so many rave reviews of this product, I decided to try it, as I&#x27;ve noticed over the years my eyelashes are getting sparser. I used it for two months exactly as directed, at night and in the morning before applying mascara, never skipping a day. I even took before and after photos so I wouldn&#x27;t be relying on my memory. There is absolutely no difference in the length or thickness of my eyelashes after two months of use. I am very disappointed in this product and would recommend it to no one.</li>
    <li> It works! Takes about 14 days to see the first results</li>
    <li> I have faithfully applied this serum, and think it may be working a little, but I am not sure if this is just the serum, which sticks to the lashes, and may be  giving my lashes a little length, or my lashes. If I stop, my lashes go back to their original length. I&#x27;d say this sort of does it&#x27;s job, but not enough for me. It gives you the feeling you are doing something for yourself, but, in the end, I should probably get one of the prescription brands.</li>
    <li> After shelling out the big bucks for Latisse, then ditching it after reading scary reviews about eye color change.. I started using this instead. I apply it like Latisse- I line my upper lid every night before bed..I don&#x27;t even bother coating my lashes because I think that&#x27;s a waste of product since the growing happens at the root.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been using it probably every other night (cuz I forget) for like 2 months and I don&#x27;t even use mascara now most days. Just curl and go. LOVE the results, and the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> I was surprised at home many people commented on my eyelashes after starting this product.  My lashes are much longer and fuller..</li>
    <li> I swear, for the life of me I can&#x27;t figure out why so many think this stuff is so great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the past 10 days I have been using it and see zero difference in lashes -- even in their condition.  Also, because you&#x27;re supposed to apply it like mascara and like eyeliner, it may get into your eyes (especially if you apply before bed).  This stuff BURNS LIKE HELL!!  I can&#x27;t even continue to use it, it burns so badly.  This stuff gets only 1 star from me.</li>
    <li> After using this product for a few weeks, I would recommend it to anyone who has skimpy, light eyelashes. I&#x27;m not sure what it does exactly, but my eyelashes look better overall, especially after applying this serum, letting it dry, then putting on mascara. For me, it works like a primer. Nice!</li>
    <li> I am 58 years old and have seen a great loss in eyelashes and eyebrows.  I used to have people ask me if I had false eyelashes.  I honestly don&#x27;t have money to pay for the expensive eyelash enhancer products.  I have used this for 5 weeks with the hope of improvement.  Well it helped.  It seems that my lashes are a bit longer. They are softer.  Each strand is thicker but there has been no new growth.  I used it day and night.  I put it on top and underneath both top and bottom lashes.  I also rubbed it in my eyebrows but there is no improvement there. I will continue to use it because the appearance is better.  If it eventually gets to a point that I know my lashes are growing I will try to figure out how to update this review.  I bought it at Wal-Mart for about $13.00. I used the recommended mascara with it but did not like the way lumps of mascara would gather on my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is now June 6, 2012 and I have been using this for awhile.  My Eyelashes are longer but not much different from what they used to be.  They are thicker.  I will continue to use this as I know it helps.</li>
    <li> L&#x27;Oreal Lash Boosting Serum is a nice way of enhancing one&#x27;s lashes.  It did not produce more lashes, yet it gave the appearance of fuller lashes for a nice look. This product does not irritate my eyes.  I have used it for months and am pleased with this product. Give it a try ladies, you may enjoy it&#x27;s benefits.</li>
    <li> I can see no change after two weeks.  I bought a difference product which was more expensive but has reputation of working.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed when I received this. The package was open and it looked as if the glue was un sticked, or the package was very old.</li>
    <li> It was really a let down. It contains ingredients for healthy hair like kariten but not really anything that promotes hair growth.</li>
    <li> I really wasn&#x27;t sure if this would work for me or not for many reasons. I have very sensitive eyes and I would usually develop styes from something like this, but I have had no problems. My lashes have grown substantially longer and stronger over the past month of using it. I use it at night and underneath my mascara during the day. I am so happy I have found this, especially for the price!  I would recommend this for anyone with short lashes!</li>
    <li> This has made a difference in the thickness of my eyelashes.  I wasn&#x27;t sure it would really work, but it does.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t do overnight magic but it definitely works with consistent use over time. I apply it directly on the lashes (as opposed to the lid at the roots as the intructions say).</li>
    <li> My lashes were short and it didn&#x27;t give me that sexy look I&#x27;ve been looking for. I started wearing eyelash strips. Over the course of the years wearing strips, my lashes became very short and unattracted, so I decided to try Loreal lash serum and I must say it was worth the $14 . I have been using the serum for almost three weeks now, and I must say I finally have the long thicker lashes I&#x27;ve been wanting for a long time. I feel so sexy now. I get lots of compliments. People still think I wear eyelash strips. I would highly recommend this to anyone who want long and thick lashes.</li>
    <li> for about 10 bucks this worked better than revitalash and maybe better than lilash. It doesn&#x27;t stain your lid and can be used on the lashes under mascara (don&#x27;t recommend this as it&#x27;s a little gloopy...great for at night though)</li>
    <li> My eyelashes are definately longer and fuller.  I did not have any redness or problems with the application.  The applicator is a little difficult to use.</li>
    <li> The packaging was horrible, it was like if someone had opened it and put it together without gluing it or something but the product is great! 😊 would give 5 stars if the packaging was better..</li>
    <li> I had NO eyebrows and few lashes due to a medication I had to be on. My dermatologist said lashes and brows grown on about a 40 day cycle, so you need to use it religiously for at least that long for full effect. I bought this bc I couldn&#x27;t afford the more expensive products and have like L&#x27;Oreal in the past. I used it every night before bed on both lashes and brow area and WOW! I have lashes and brows and they are thick and strong! I absolutely love this product! The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that it&#x27;s very difficult to get that last little bit out of the tube, but that true of most cosmetics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend this product - it&#x27;s fantastic and i got amazing results!</li>
    <li> Starting with the ugly, if you intend to apply this in the morning you will have no choice but to wear mascara. This product kind of sits on the lashes in a sort of unsightly way, which isn&#x27;t a problem if you&#x27;re a daily mascara wearer. As such, I went from using this twice a day to only once a day very quickly. I didn&#x27;t like needing to put on mascara because of this serum. It will flake when applied to your eyebrows, so it&#x27;s best applied at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, my lashes have always been short. But for my 30th birthday they seemed to almost disappear altogether! My lashes were so short that even with mascara on I couldn&#x27;t seem to make them stand out or anything. I really was ready to look into one of those pricy prescription products (or try falsies). My hesitation being that the people I know of who use those products have freakishly long spider lashes. So, I decided to try this first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From my understanding this is more of a conditioning serum than some miracle grow serum, but miraculously it does seem to help! I have not been using this product religiously, but I do apply it to my lashes as well as my eyebrows (just to see what would happen). For me at least, this stuff works. To me, the most noticeable improvement has been to my eyebrows. I&#x27;ve always had thick brows, but they developed some sparse spots. Those thinner areas are filling in nicely, giving my brows a more even and fuller look. I&#x27;m no longer worried about trying to fill them in! This probably won&#x27;t take anyone from altogether thin brows to thick brows, but it has helped me out a lot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My eyelashes are noticeably longer, though only slightly, to me. But they&#x27;re not yet back to the way they were before. They do look better, so I plan to try using this religiously for awhile to see if I get better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update* My bottom lashes are now thicker and fuller than they&#x27;ve ever been in my life. I noticed that they&#x27;re look thicker and more plentiful, though still notmuch longer on the bottom. On a whim I applied mascara to the bottom, and it&#x27;s absolutely unbelievable. My bottom lashes are at least 2x thicker than they were. Even in my teens, when I tried applying mascara to my bottom lashes it didn&#x27;t make much difference. They would look a little longer, but that was about it. Now with mascara on the bottom, my bottom lashes look like falsies lol. Again, I&#x27;ve yet to see a drastic improvement in over all length, but everyone noticed the difference in my bottom lashes.</li>
    <li> Thanks ... exelent product</li>
    <li> So when I use this I put it on in the mornings and I don&#x27;t add mascara. Then before I go to bed I wipe it off with a makeup remover then add more and when I get up I do the same thing all over again. I saw results in a week. Also when applying coat your lashes thoroughly, literally all over.</li>
    <li> This came as a bonus for a minimal cost when I purchased eyelash enhancer. It makes my lashes look longer when I use mascara. I really like it.</li>
    <li> Ever since I had my son, my lashes got weak and short. I always wanted to try something that grows my lashes, but I didn&#x27;t want spend tons of money for something I&#x27;m not sure I can use. So, I read all kinds of reviews and this had good reviews and affordable. I used it morning( right before I put makeup on) and at night(right after I washed my face). My lashes grew a lot in just a day!! Even my husband noticed my lashes a few days later. This stuff works!!</li>
    <li> i was so glad to find this so cheap. its sooo much more in the stores. i use this every night after i wash my face. it doen&#x27;t make my lashes grow a lot but it does condition them nicely! i&#x27;d buy this over and over again.</li>
    <li> I have OK lashes but a couple thin spots I wanted to fill out and a few &amp;#34;errant&amp;#34; ones that won&#x27;t go the same direction as the others. I expected this product to help with these issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I planned to write a review after using the entire tube of serum. I have been using it every day, twice a day. since it arrived about one month ago so I figure that is long enough to see a difference. Or not. And I see no difference in my lashes whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I intend to keep using it until the tube is empty. I will update my review at that time.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this product, but since it isn&#x27;t horribly expensive, I thought I&#x27;d give a try. Why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad I did. I use it every night before bed, and it&#x27;s made my lashes noticeably longer. I&#x27;ll admit that I have decent lashes to begin with, but after I started using this, friends actually started complimenting me on my lashes. I didn&#x27;t tell anyone that I was using a new product, so that speaks volumes (although I had also noticed the change myself). I also used it on my eyebrows, and it filled in a little &amp;#34;bald&amp;#34; patch I have on one eyebrow. I love it when a product actually does what it claims to do. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have used it as directed every day.  There has been absolutely no change in my lashes.  It is such a waste of money.  It&#x27;s really false advertising.</li>
    <li> After a few weeks of using this product, I found my lashes to be fuller, and a bit longer.  Works well for the price</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions exactly but there was no detectable regrowth at all, even after I used the whole bottle.</li>
    <li> This product is lightweight, simple to use before mascara (JUST LET IT DRY FIRST!), and provides results within a few short weeks. I was skeptical, but boy was I shocked when I realized how soon my eyelashes grew longer and dramatic.  I cannot recommend this product enough.</li>
    <li> My lashes seem to be healthier and I did notice some growth. They are slow growing. But they seem to be fuller. I think this is a good product</li>
    <li> Used this for one month saw zero results. would not buy again nor recommend this product to anyone. Wasted money.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 3years and my lashes are thicker and super long. I have people asking me if I&#x27;m wearing fake lashes. I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anna</li>
    <li> I had purchased this product awhile back and was skeptical about using it.  I thought it was like many other products promising so much but becoming a BIG disappointment.  It took me almost a year after purchase to try it.  HOWEVER was I wrong!  I can&#x27;t believe I let it sit in my closet for sooooo long.  I&#x27;m over 40 and never had very long lashes anyway.  I finally tried this and BOY did I see a difference within 4 weeks.  I&#x27;m now to the point where I barely put any mascara on.  My lashes are longer, thicker and fuller.  I had tried fake lashes and my lashes right now are BETTER and LONGER than those fake lashes I had once worn.  I just bought more of the lash serum and I&#x27;m so glad I don&#x27;t have to buy that expensive prescription Latise Lash serum.  I am very happy with this product... it delivers its promise (unlike the current President who wasted his 4 years)!  I know some people are disappointed so I guess it also depends on your genetics and how your body responds.  Mine responded extremely well.</li>
    <li> it is really good . I love it . it is worth to buy. it really help my eyelash to be long</li>
    <li> With age, my lashes have become fine and sparse.  L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Bossting Serum gives you long, full lashes.  Use it at night or under mascara.  (It&#x27;s best if you let the serum dry before applying mascara).  I cannot find this product in the big box stores.  I could only find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I tried this from the drugstore, but it really didn&#x27;t do anything. I put it on everynight before bed, and in the am before my own mascara, and every weekend, and it just... didn&#x27;t DO anything. I guess it&#x27;s just soft waxes and oils or something that make you go \\&quot;OOoooo, my lashes are so soft now. Whhheeee.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and spend it on a REAL serum like Latisse or Rapid Lash or whatever. This is more of a drugstore brand trying to cash in on the hype without actually ponying up the goods. Blasphemy, sir! A pox on your both houses, Mr. L&#x27;Oreal- long have I trusted in you, and you have trampled on your own good reputation this day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our relationship is on thin ice, L&#x27;Oreal. Thin ice. &#x27;Tis a sad day when a even a purveyor of rouges and creams cannot be trusted in his promises. Now I must cheer myself and complete my toilette.... with MAC.</li>
    <li> Have been using about a month but really don&#x27;t notice any difference. In my mid 50&#x27;s and have fairly full eye lashes but thought this might help make them a little fuller. Maybe it takes longer for some people so will continue to use it. Unsure if I would reorder it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since high school, and I cannot even begin to describe how much I love this product.  I have very fine, blonde hair, and naturally have short straight, thin lashes.  I started to use this product back in 2009 and I am still faithfully using this stuff.  It is awesome because it basically gives you very similar results to other products like Latisse, but you don&#x27;t have to worry about it changing your eye pigmentation, or darkening the skin.  I have teal eyes, and they have not changed at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to use this everyday, and if you discontinue use, your lashes will go back to the way they were before, as your lashes have cycles.  It takes a while to notice results, but if you are patient and consistent with applying an even coat once a day, you will notice results.  have so many lashes now, and honestly have essentially grown a third row of colorless lashes because I have used it for so long.  The lashes you grow from using this, at least in my experience, are not usually dark, so you can&#x27;t really see them very well with the naked eye, but you do as soon as you apply mascara.  I have also noticed that using this product significantly reduces the number of eyelashes that fall out!  I love this product, and I really don&#x27;t know what I would do without it!</li>
    <li> I use this only on my brows. It works! My brows are slightly darker, definitely fuller!</li>
    <li> This product does not work ... after 60 days of use, saw zero results.  The applicator is also very awkward.</li>
