<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have several bracelets like this and this one is the worst quality.</li>
    <li> Love this! We bought several of these as gifts. I like that the length is adjustable. Seems to hold up well to even daily wear.</li>
    <li> Was worth more than I paid, but materials still a little cheap. Still worth more than paid and looks super cute. Looks like picture on.</li>
    <li> mine broke the first time I wore it.  Get what you paid for.  Cute</li>
    <li> Broke the first time I put it on.&lt;br /&gt;Took over a month to recieve in the mail.</li>
    <li> have trouble putting it on.</li>
    <li> It was a little to chinsey for my taste...but fairly priced for the quality.</li>
    <li> very large, but pretty.</li>
    <li> Super cute. Has held up well. Can&#x27;t beat the price. I get compliments everytime I wear it.</li>
    <li> Very nice! Got here faster than expected.</li>
    <li> Cheaply made. Broke after 3 months.</li>
    <li> really cute, my daugher loved it!  Fast shipping and inexpensive</li>
    <li> The clasp only let&#x27;s this bracelet be a certain width so it flops around on my tiny wrist. It&#x27;s cute though.</li>
    <li> Just a great little bracelet and perfect for spring/summer.  Cute design.  It&#x27;s what I expected and a great value.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> I bought several of these. They were not the same color when i received them. I ordered teal green and they came light baby blue. Owner didn&#x27;t bother to help when i contacted him. Just a \\&quot;sorry. That&#x27;s the color they are\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect for teens.  Moms will like it as well.  Very good quality and it came pretty quick!  I bought three and didn&#x27;t have to pay shipping.</li>
    <li> This bracelet came and was just as described.  It&#x27;s intricate and beautiful.  I can&#x27;t wait to give it as a gift.  I wish I could have bought more as the price was unbelievable!</li>
    <li> Ya know...for what you pay..it&#x27;s great. Looks bettet after you wear it a few times and it becomes less stiff.</li>
    <li> Exceptional value for the price. looks nice and will go with lots of outfits and I  can&#x27;t wait to wear it!</li>
    <li> I am giving these as gifts to my daughter&#x27;s friends. I thought they would be cute. But, they are stiff and the roping is very thin. I&#x27;m hoping after some wear that they will relax and look like the picture.</li>
    <li> This bracelet was super cute but I only wore it once and it broke. I can&#x27;t expect much for the price but I am still disappointed.</li>
    <li> This fell apart on day one! You get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> I bought this on a whim due to the price, less than $3 with shipping but it truly is a &amp;#34;you get what you pay for item&amp;#34;  Which is too bad because it is adorable. IN the first 5 mins of wearing this bracelet the clasp broke and the bird charm fell off.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter received this and it&#x27;s all she expected, but it took 2 months to get it! Not happy about that!</li>
    <li> this item broke when we were trying it on! very cheap!!</li>
    <li> cute inexpensive bracelets.  A little lower quality than I expected, but for the price they are great.  Gifts for female family!</li>
    <li> Never buy- they come shipped on biathlon from china .  Too big for little girls and petite woman.  Takes 4 weeks to arrive!</li>
    <li> Nice design and color, but the rope/string was a little too thin for me. I thought it would be thicker. In all it was a good purchase for the money spent.</li>
    <li> They fit well and look good with quiet a few clothing. It is different from other bracelets and I get quiet a few complements when I wear them.</li>
    <li> love it. pretty and classy .good colors too. perfect shade if blue and white and length of chain sizes to choice from</li>
    <li> These are cute, functional, pretty and stylish. I gave these to my friends for valentines day and they loved them.</li>
    <li> My teenage daughter really wanted this and it was cheap so I obliged. Took several months to arrive, by which time both of us had forgotten about it. Someone else had purchased a similar bracelet for her in a different color and design by then. She was happy to wear them both and other than the owl falling off soon after, it has held up well.</li>
    <li> Cute bracelet, too bad it broke the very first day I wore it.  I didn&#x27;t hit it against anything, I just went about my daily routine.  I guess I shouldn&#x27;t be surprised since it was not very expensive.</li>
    <li> Fair rating for the price. Obviously with how inexpensive it is, you can&#x27;t expect exceptional quality.&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, my daughter loves it. So I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> It was pretty but I didn&#x27;t like the clasp.  I thought this was going to be a wrap style bracelet and it isn&#x27;t.  Also, mine had some red pen marks on the white braid (obviously not supposed to be there).</li>
    <li> Very cute bracelet.  Well worth the price!  Colors are pretty and charms adorable. Recommend  purchasing several to use as gifts throughout the year.</li>
    <li> Cute but clasp is more like a toy type, however it works. The bands a cord rather than leather as it appears. For the price I bought two and the teen girls like them.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect the bracelet to be attached into one bracelet. Thought it would be a wrap around with distinctive spaces between the bands. It bunches up too much and is difficult to see the individual bands. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It was really cheap and when I got it, it was cheap for obvious reasons. It seemed very &amp;#34;plastic-like&amp;#34; and small.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my daughter in law who loves our I thought it would be a very nice gift to give her when she gave birth to my first granddaughter. Unfortunately it did not make it here in time, it actually took a very long time for it to arrive but at least I got it and it was in one piece. It is very pretty but it is very stiff so hopefully as she wears that it will soften up and that it doesn&#x27;t break like many of the reviews have said that it does. Wish us luck that it holds up for at least a little while. I know it wasn&#x27;t expensive at all it was actually extremely cheap but it&#x27;s the thought that counts.</li>
    <li> Bracelet is more blue than turquoise than I was expecting. I haven&#x27;t worn it yet it just seems stiff and uncomfortable to wear.</li>
    <li> I was really disappointed when I received the Vintage Handmade Infinity Silver 8 Owl Leaf Bird Leather Bracelet.  The picture is very misleading.  I would not recommend purchaseing unless it is for a very small child and then you have to be concerned about the small parts for someone of that age who might appreciate it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty &amp; all but feels very cheap. Other than that it&#x27;s nice</li>
    <li> I reallly should get a new one, thus I would return the broken one. Pls help me. Pls make this right.</li>
    <li> Charms don&#x27;t lay properly on your arm, so looks like it&#x27;s on wrong or upside down, only there&#x27;s no right way or right side up.  Luckily I only bought it for fun because it was so cheap, so not much lost!</li>
    <li> Loved it when it came on! But it was very cheaply made :( broke a day later. But I can&#x27;t complain it was only a couple bucks... Just wear with caution!</li>
    <li> Though this bracelet took a while to get here, I think it was well worth the wait. It was a lot smaller than I expected, but I like that, because I don&#x27;t really like big bracelets. Though it may appear to be 5 separate bracelets, it&#x27;s really one, connected by a bar on either side. There is a long chain to fasten it, so you can make it bigger or smaller. Even at it&#x27;s smallest setting though, it was to big for, but I have extremely skinny wrists. I use it as an anklet, which it works well for.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t want the bird on it, so I took it off really easily by bending open the link. The fastening chain came off, but if you have pliers, it&#x27;s super easy to fix. The owls haven&#x27;t come apart yet, but they&#x27;re really easy to put back together.&lt;br /&gt;Altogether, I really like this bracelet. It looks a lot like the picture, and even though it broke, it was really easy to fix. I would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> i was very disappointed, this was cheaply made and not nearly as nice as pictured.&lt;br /&gt;would not recommend to others</li>
    <li> It was poorly made. Cheap quality.  The bracket broke 2 minutes after I put it on my daughters wrist. Was not what I expected when purchasing.</li>
    <li> you get what you pay for. Bad quality and very cheap metal, ordered one received two. The only good thing about receiving two is that because one broke, I have another one.</li>
    <li> I think this is the cutest most unique idea for a bracelet I&#x27;ve ever seen.  It seems to be well made and is very pretty.  I&#x27;ve seen a lot of bracelets made this way, but this one is truly beautiful.</li>
    <li> I love this bracelet.  Everyone has commented on how much they like it.  It goes with everything and will fit snug or I can fasten it to fit loose.  Awesome gift for yourself or someone else.</li>
    <li> Very pretty. Gave as gift</li>
    <li> the bracelets are made of cheaper materials, however they are great for the price. they are cute gifts for girls.</li>
    <li> fell apart immediately.  Sad as it is cute and one gets what one pays for.  Maybe attached it on an immobile item...??</li>
    <li> Got this a lot earlier then expected which was awesome! But within an hour of having it, the little bird charm fell off. It was an easy fix, but still..I only had it for an hour of wearing it! Still cute and worth the price :) looks exactly like the photo too.</li>
    <li> Good quality for something so inexpensive-love it!  Like the design but may be too small for some wrists.  I will be getting more - great gift idea.</li>
    <li> Looks just like the picture. Very cute. It didn&#x27;t take too long to receive.  Seems to be made well. Nice product.</li>
    <li> It broke the first time I wore it!! I do not recommend this bracelet unless your not going to wear it.</li>
    <li> Seriously!  Each time (only 3 and barely a couple hours each time) I wore it something broke off it.  1- the bird hanging on the leaf, 2. the 2 owls attached together and 3 the hooks that attach it all together....so now it cant even be worn.  Looks nice in the pic.  Didnt and shouldnt expect much for the cost of it.  Thats what I get from Hong Kong....crap.  DO NOT BUY.</li>
    <li> Glad  I have one I love it</li>
    <li> Purchased for my 13 year old daughter who loves owls and jewelry.  It was perfect for her!  She loved it.</li>
    <li> It looks cheap, not at all as on the photo. I just don&#x27;t like it. Will not order again. A</li>
    <li> The bracelet arrived damaged, but because of the great price I kept it and replaced the fish that was damaged, now I wear it often.</li>
    <li> cute and love the color but was so stiff i couldn&#x27;t wear the bracelet&lt;br /&gt;would have been better if it wasnt so stiff</li>
    <li> i put this on and 10 mins later the bird broke off , cheap made hated it.don&#x27;t buy it. taylor in maryland</li>
    <li> I really like the way this bracelet looks.  the only problem is that it&#x27;s very hard to put on by yourself.  once you have it on its really cute</li>
    <li> I am happy with my purchase. I bought it as a gift for my sister&#x27;s birthday. The color is more of a blue than turquoise. I was a bit disappointed on the color.</li>
    <li> Prompt service, but bracelet is much smaller than it looks.</li>
    <li> The clasps have broken on the first use, so I had to use my jewelry tools to fix it and prevent it from happening again.</li>
    <li> This arrived fine and was the right color. However it does feel delicate and I am sure I will have to be very careful with it. But for the price, a good deal.</li>
    <li> Just sort of cheap...it didn&#x27;t cost a lot, so I can be surprised, but it just isn&#x27;t quite what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Cute, loved the colors, but hard to put on.</li>
    <li> first time I wore it and it ripped the owls out of nowhere, but the rest look very nice after all</li>
    <li> I like how small the bird and owls are. Not overpowering. Perfect for my 9 year old daughter. The bracelet came folded so I&#x27;m hoping after frequent wear that will smooth out. Looks cute on. Happy with price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After ONE time wearing it the bird was lost. I thought it was still cute even though the dangly bird was lost, but then after the SECOND time wearing it the owls busted apart and were flapping. Disappointing because it&#x27;s so cute, but even though it was inexpensive not really worth it for only 2 wears even if it is a great price.</li>
    <li> These are hard to buckle because they have a cheap chain on one side and a clam clip on the other side.... I am hoping that I can either take them apart and restring or wear them and get them stretched so they lay flat too.... the color was not as turquoise as I thought it is more of a baby blue.</li>
    <li> If I could give it zero stars, I would. While I guess I shouldn&#x27;t have expected much since it didn&#x27;t cost much, It is very poorly made and fell apart the first time I wore it, and I have a small wrist. The rings that are used are very cheap metal and didn&#x27;t even hold together.</li>
    <li> I felt this bracelet was too big. It should have been made to fit a big or small wrist but it&#x27;s not. It spins around too much and is a little flimsy.</li>
    <li> Super cute.  Wish the bird was not quite so cheapy, However, it was a REALLY good price.  I also was a bit peeved that the first time I wore it, it fell off because the jump ring was not tightened enough... just double check and tighten it a bit.</li>
    <li> My son bought this for a girl he likes.  It is perfect for young girls (not something an adult would take much pride in).  It is dainty and seems to be with the trend.  I do worry -based on some reviews from other companies selling the same product- that this bracelet is prone to breaking.  But upon giving it to the girl, my son got enjoyment out of her thinking how pretty it was.</li>
    <li> Very beautiful and well make. I think my friend will be very happy for her birthday. May have to order another one for me.</li>
    <li> I found it a little hard to put on, but otherwise it is wonderful. Definitely worth the price that I paid.</li>
    <li> Cute!!!! Well made and original!!! I Git pits if compliments and the price was &amp;#34;WOW&amp;#34;!!!! It added a pop of color to me black dresss!</li>
    <li> Great buy for less than a dollar. Simple and trendy. No complaints here.</li>
    <li> The bracelet is really cute just as pictured but it is super difficult to clasp. My daughter really likes it.</li>
    <li> Wen I went to put it on it was very stiff wore it for 2 days and then just fell apart , very dissatisfied</li>
    <li> ! SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER!  NOT AS THEY APPEARED IN PICTURE. POOR QUALITY!&lt;br /&gt;MORE ON THE LINE OF A DOLLAR STORE PRODUCT. TOOK A LONG TIME TO GET THEM, THEY CAME DIRECT FROM HONG KONG WHICH I DID NOT KNOW WE I ORDERED THEM.M.</li>
    <li> like the bracelet but after wearing it at work for about an hour the bird fell off of the link it was on....lost the bird charm or i could have fixed it...</li>
    <li> The bracelet is very cute and for $3 you can&#x27;t go wrong. Not quite as sturdy as it appears in the photo, but I received compliments on it the first time I wore it. It IS cute.</li>
    <li> I love it, it is just as described,  light weight, and beautiful.  Just my style&lt;br /&gt;The description and picture are exact.</li>
    <li> This was such a pretty bracelet for a great price.  I especially love the little bird.  It looks like several bracelets all in one.  Very pleased!</li>
    <li> It looks just like the picture, could be a little better quality but for what I paid it&#x27;s worth it</li>
    <li> i love this!!  so cute and sweet!! can wear it with anything!</li>
    <li> Excellent, it came 2 weeks earlier and looks amazing!</li>
    <li> It arrived broken! Then I got it to latch with missing links, and the bird fell off. Piece of crap jewely.. i do NOT recommend this for anyone!</li>
    <li> It was well packaged and exactly how it was shown!</li>
    <li> It took forever to be delivered. I mean over a month. I didn&#x27;t even remember anything about it until it showed up. Then it burst when worn the first day. My advise, don&#x27;t waste your money on this</li>
    <li> This is a cute item for a pre-teen or teenager. The quality is cheap, but for the price I really cannot complain. The color is more of a baby-blue rather than the aqua blue as pictured on the display. This takes a long time to ship, so order it early.</li>
    <li> gave this as a gift and the recipient loved it. Very cute, stylish and fun</li>
    <li> Love this bracelet!! Very trendy. Goes with a lot of my outfits. 😊 Only issue I have is hooking it. I always need to ask someone to hook and unhook it. But I love it!</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price! The bracelet is super cute on and goes with almost anything. The clasp catches on my clothes every once in awhile, but just have to be careful.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s beautiful! I look forward to giving it as a gift to my mother and sister and may buy more down some friends.affordablw gift.</li>
    <li> The bracelet looks exactly like the photo.  But after a few wearings, the jump ring on the bird loosened and caused the bird to fall off.  Also, the braided material and cording were stiffer than I thought they would be from the photo so the bracelet is more rigid than I would like.  It was a good value for the price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cute and I&#x27;ve received lots of compliments on it. I can tell it&#x27;s not super fantastic quality, but definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> TPT Vintage Handmade Infinity Silver 8 Owl Leaf Bird Leather Bracelet...color is as pictured. it is a fun piece to wear.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t got this yet?love this and will be gald when it gets here it&#x27;s taking long time have a nice day</li>
    <li> It was very cute. My daughter loved it and put it on immediately. I was happy with the quality. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Its beautiful!!! The little bird is much littler that I originally thought but its still pretty and I still love it!!!</li>
    <li> THIS BRACELET IS CHEAP BUT YOU BET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. IT LOOKS LIKE THE PICTURE BUT SEEMS CHEAPER THAN THAT. IT IS CUTE THOUGH AND THE BLUE IS A LITTLE LIGHTER THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE</li>
    <li> I put it on, and not 30 minutes later I noticed that the little bird charm had fallen off.  So, needless to say my bracelet no longer has the bird charm but it is still cute.  You get what you pay for I guess.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Unfortunately, Amazon has proven to me that they do not care about their customers.  When I had an issue with a different product (Amazon&#x27;s fault-defective product) I contacted Amazon and they refused to make it right.  After I emailed them (seven times!) I never once heard back from them.  What a TERRIBLE way to treat your customers!!!  Beware!  If you can, always try and buy items from the companies who make them directly...DO NOT go through Amazon.  They do not deserve the money when they disregard their customers so terribly!</li>
    <li> The bracelet has great quality. The color is beautiful. It fits so many sizes. I love it. I would recommend this to anyone thinking of purchasing this type of bracelet.</li>
    <li> My daughter saw this &amp;loved it. Arrived earlier than expected &amp; it was exactly as pictured,great buy for the price.</li>
    <li> I really like the look of the bracelet, I just find it very hard to close. That being said, I am happy with my purchase, and I do wear it.</li>
    <li> it shipped really fast. I didn&#x27;t have any problems getting it like some others state that they did. It was exactly like in the pic!</li>
    <li> was not impressed, even though very inexpensive , I only had the pleasure to wear it once. Already broke! Too bad</li>
    <li> this bracelet is so cute my daughter love owels so i got it for her sent in a timely manner and cute as a botten</li>
    <li> Much smaller than the picture makes you believe it&#x27;s going to be, but still a beautiful piece of jewelry. Perfect for a gift</li>
    <li> Seems to be pretty sturdy, and has all the layers shown. The chain from the clasp can be adjusted to be smaller or larger.</li>
    <li> I expected it maybe to wrap around the arm in layers but all the bracelets are attached to one strip of metal and clasp.  I&#x27;m hopeful it will hold up well.  The details are pretty.</li>
    <li> Very cute bracelet. Unfortunately the little bird charm fell off the first day I wore it but otherwise it is very well made.</li>
    <li> They were very cheaply made, fell apart after wearing just a couple times.  :(</li>
    <li> The bracelet looks exactly as pictured. I did not take it out of the plastic as it was a gift for a friend, but it looks to be a good quality. I would recommend this bracelet.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite braclets. I wear it all the time.</li>
    <li> looked just like the picture, but run kinda big</li>
    <li> Get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I get compliments on this all the time! For the price it&#x27;s an excellent product. I&#x27;ve bought many more like this because they are so unique and make people jealous :)</li>
    <li> My daughter LOVED IT , REALLY PRETTY COLORS , HOPE IT LADTS LONGER THAN THE SAME BRACELET ( DIFFERENT&lt;br /&gt;STYLE ) THAT I RECEIVED LADT WEEK !</li>
    <li> I was impressed by quality. My granddaughter broke out in smiles and loves it. Arrived when anticipated I perfect shape</li>
    <li> The little owl fell off right away, the first time i wore it and won&#x27;t go back on. Its a cute bracelet for it&#x27;s price... but it is also as breakable as it&#x27;s price.</li>
    <li> when i got this bracelet it was really nice and looks exactly like the photo. after i wore it for 1 hour the bracelet clasp broke. i was able to fix it and put it back on, after i wore it again the bird came off. overall really bad quality and i was kind of disappointed that i waited so long for this and it fell apart in a few hours</li>
    <li> Its too big it doesn&#x27;t fit on me properly cause it literally falls off my arm.i m not happy with it</li>
    <li> i really like the bracelet. it is made really well. and it has a chain that you can adjust the size.</li>
    <li> I got this bracelt for my daughter &amp; she loved it. Its a beautiful bracelet at a great price. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful bracelet!  I&#x27;m giving it to my daughter for Easter and I know she will enjoy it.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating bc of the fact that I&#x27;ve only wore it 5 times and the little bird has already fell off. It was easy to fix, and so I did, but that is my only complaint. I do however, LOVE this bracelet.</li>
    <li> BRACELET DID NOT HAVE A CLASP TO SECURE IT. HAD TO FIND ONE OFF OF ONE OF MY NECKLACES SO MY DAUGHTER COULD WEAR IT.  WAITED A LONG TIME TO GET ITEM AND WAS EXCITED TO GIVE TO MY DAUGHTER, GAVE TO HER AND TO MY SURPRISE AND EMBARRASSMENT IT DIDNT HAVE A CLASP.&lt;br /&gt;NOT A HAPPY CUSTOMER.</li>
    <li> We got this for my daughter for her birthday. It took quite awhile to receive it and it isn&#x27;t made as nice as I had hoped but still pretty good for the money.</li>
    <li> Really nice bracelet....my daughter loved it.  The photo does not due justice. Really nice accessorey.&lt;br /&gt;Ordered another one in a different color.</li>
    <li> Great quality for the price.  If the clasps ever came loose, I can easily fix but so far so good.  I like the birds, and the braid and rope look.  I have been buying owl items lately, and this fits right in.  Also have an infinity symbol ring, earring and bracelet that match. Trendy and cute.  Goes with most of my other jewelry (I wear a lot of silver).  I have since received and ordered similar items because I enjoy this cute piece so much.  What a deal!</li>
    <li> This is nice nice nice. I can wear this with anything I have. I hope to see different patterns in the future.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because it looked so cute and is much cheaper than other bracelets I saw that are almost identical. I love the way it looks, and I love that it has a clasp to adjust it to the wrist.&lt;br /&gt;It took a long time to get here, but as long as you don&#x27;t mind waiting, it&#x27;s worth the small amount of money!</li>
    <li> Looked just like picture and my daughter loves it. Very sturdy clasp and looks great on. Took a little longer than I thought to come in but very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Runs large even for my &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; sized wrists. Also very cheap clasp! Broke within an hr. Of course.... you get what you pay for right?</li>
    <li> One of the blue cords was almost broken when I got it.</li>
    <li> Broke after a couple of wears.</li>
    <li> Broke after wearing it 2 times.  Cheaply made</li>
    <li> Bought one for myself and one for my daughter. Very inexpensive and pretty at that.</li>
    <li> It was really cute... then it broke. -.-</li>
    <li> I Gave it one star because I didn&#x27;t even get through the door and it broke. I bought many in different colors and styles and they also came apart. They are very pretty though.</li>
    <li> Took forever to come. But product looks as expected.</li>
    <li> this braclet is to cute! the charms an accent pieces were a little smaller than expected but still cute :)</li>
    <li> This looks pretty but thats it. It broke right out of the package. I fixed it and it broke in two other places later in the day. I took if off and threw it out. Not worth it even with the cheap price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very adorable, yes it does take a while for it to arrive but I&#x27;ve had no issues with it. It seems to be well made.</li>
    <li> I love the look of this bracelet...the colors, different strands, all of it. I got it the day it was supposed to arrive, only to discover that there&#x27;s no way to actually wear it. I am super disappointed! I didn&#x27;t expect super high quality because of the price, but it can&#x27;t even be used how it is.</li>
    <li> I had thought this was a wrap bracelet, but my daughter loves it just the way it is! Very spring like!</li>
    <li> This is an ideal teenage girls bracelet. My daughter loves it and it&#x27;s so cute - I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love it its very nice cute and fits well.  Only problem i have is that first time i wore it the little bird connected to the branch fell off and never did find it, dont think it was very secure., that is the only draw back in buying it</li>
    <li> I thought the package was lost, when indeed it had arrived and I had forgotten and misplaced it. They offered to send me another one without any hassle, which was great on their part. Fortunately I found it before they had to resend it.</li>
    <li> I shouldn&#x27;t have showered with it because one of the strings detached but it is so pretty on! I would buy more but this time I would keep them out of the shower.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t like this bracelet because soon after I got it, one of the ropes snapped right off the closure and now I don&#x27;t know how to fix it. I guess I should&#x27;ve expected this because of the price being so low.</li>
    <li> Daughter loves it. Took a very long time to get, but she wears it to work everday. SHe is a waitress so it takes some wear and tear. Holds up nicely.</li>
    <li> Its beautiful but doesn&#x27;t last long.  My daughter put it on and it broke 30 minutes later. Very cheaply made.</li>
    <li> bought for a gift. Nice bracelet</li>
    <li> I love this! It&#x27;s exactly as the picture!</li>
    <li> Well I love these inexpensive leathery bracelets. I bought one to match just about every outfit I have. Pretty well-made too.</li>
    <li> mala calidad no me gusta, parece producto de menos de 1 $</li>
    <li> Pretty bracelet, very stiff, and didn&#x27;t hold up well.  Considering the price, it was fair.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. This bracelet was cheaply made and broke the first week I received it.</li>
    <li> Was super excited when this came only to have it broken. It took so long to get it I just support glued it better then nothing</li>
    <li> I love this bracelet!</li>
    <li> Exactly as seen!! Love it! I thought the price was wrong and you would not receive all of this I was wrong!!</li>
    <li> Fell apart in the first two days. Very cute, if it stayed together. Not worth over anything over a dollar.</li>
    <li> Was not as attractive when I got it as it was on picture on the computer.  I was disappointed as I bought it as a gift for my granddaughter-</li>
    <li> I was pleased with the bracelt.  It was exactly what I expected it to be .  Comes from China so don&#x27;t be in a hurry for its arrival.</li>
    <li> I guess it would be cute for a 4  year old girl but it&#x27;s sized for an adult. Made very cheaply but I guess u get what u pay for.</li>
    <li> This bracelet is super cute, I have worn it just about every day since I got it a week ago (delivered on time). Within 2 days the bird fell off, and by the end of the week the ring holding the owls together fell off. I will still wear it, but afraid it will just fall off and I will lose it.</li>
    <li> Very cute but stiff.  However for the price?  Its PERFECT.</li>
    <li> I thought it would be better a little flimsy</li>
    <li> Very pretty for the price.  Took FOREVER to get here though.</li>
    <li> This bracelet was very cute. But it did have it problems. Within the fist week of having it, the little bird that dangles from the bottom steep fell off. But that was ok as the bracket was still cute without it. I actually used the bird for something else. But sadly, the thing to hook it together and chain had all fallen apart. I was able to fix the hook, but not the chain. Thankfully I am still able to hook it together, but that&#x27;s only because I have a small wrist. It&#x27;s very cute, but it is very cheap.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little big and on the &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; side, but for a couple bucks, I didn&#x27;t expect much.  It&#x27;s adorable and arrived very quickly.  Overall I&#x27;m quite happy with it for what I paid.</li>
    <li> This bracelet looks great in the picture but when it arrived I felt like it belonged in one of those quarter machines at a supermarket. It is cheaply made and way to big. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much due to the cheap price but I at least hoped it would be worthy of three stars. Saddened that this will never be worn.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical to buy these bracelets, as many from China are so cheaply made, and at this price, I was sure that I was probably going to get what I paid for, but I was pleasantly surprised!!!  I bought 3 of these bracelets, and gave 2 as gifts. My daughter, niece and I all loved them!  We still wear and enjoy them. They are made quite well!  They may be inexpensive, but they are NOT cheap, and I would certainly buy them again!</li>
    <li> broke the first time i wore it</li>
    <li> I purchased these bracelet as a gift for a friend. Although it had to be reshipped due to the first one not arriving, I can appreciate the speedy resoonse of the seller. My friend received the second mailed one and says she has worn it twice so far.</li>
    <li> this is super cute and looks to be of good quality for how cheaply it cost to purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to wear it more this summer and see how long it stands up to the test of time and use</li>
    <li> Saving this lovely bracelet to give to a friend for her birthday.  She will love it!  Hope I can wait a couple of months to give it or keep it for myself.</li>
    <li> this is a very pretty bracelet and the turquoise color is lovely but it is very difficult to put on----had to have help</li>
    <li> stiff too hard to bend around wrist, will try again because they are so cheap. not like it cost a fortune!</li>
    <li> This broke the day I received it. I only wore it a few hours. It is cheap and cheaply made.</li>
    <li> Super cute bracelet. Looks exactly like the picture. Got here he say it was suppose to and nothing was stained or broken</li>
    <li> Very cheaply made.  Charm has already come off and the clasp came off. I would not recommend this even if it is cheap in price, it is also cheap in craftsmanship.</li>
    <li> Looks just like the picture! Absolutely love it (: and a very beautiful blue color. Obviously the colors don&#x27;t usually ever come out the exact same online as they do in person. So it&#x27;s a really pretty aqua blue. Very happy!</li>
    <li> It looks like it&#x27;s all seperate and it&#x27;s not at all. It&#x27;s all one crappy little bracelet. When I say little I mean TINY</li>
    <li> Description says high quality, but it is very much not. I assumed as much considering the price... it&#x27;s worth it to buy it for parts and make your own version of the bracelet instead. The bird fell off after one day of wearing it.  The findings are pretty low quality, and the cording is very lightweight.  The owls and leaf parts are reasonable quality, so use them for something else.</li>
    <li> This bracelet is so pretty! I love the design. It&#x27;s so fresh and perfect for spring. The price was right and shipping was fast. Go ahead and make the purchase. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> if you collect owls you love this !  Very low price too. Great gift.</li>
    <li> the color is different</li>
    <li> very cheap but i guess you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> Aside from taking over a month to receive... the product is just cheap and broke after 1 day of wearing... i guess you get what you pay for...</li>
    <li> I thought i would get this since it was under $3 and free shipping &amp; i am VERY HAPPY with this decision! They have bracelets like this at our local mall in &amp;#34;CLAIRE&#x27;S&amp;#34; and they start at $8 and go up in price from there. So why not just wait a bit for it to ship and buy a few for the same price? :) I love it! The metal is solid and not thin and easily breakable, the fastenings are great quality and the cording is not thin. (look&#x27;s like leather but just cotton cord). I am very happy and recommend this but i can ONLY speak for the one i received from the seller i purchased it from. I am sure there are plenty of variations, styles and levels of quality. Thank you!</li>
    <li> The picture does this bracelet way more justice.  Its made of poor quality and I don&#x27;t want to wear it.  You get what you paid for I guess.</li>
    <li> Looks better in the picture.  Wish you could separate each bracelet to wear just one or a couple at a time, but they are all connected.  Cute bracelet, but cheaply made.</li>
    <li> Broke as soon as I tried to put it on</li>
    <li> This bracelet shipped from China and didn&#x27;t have a tracking number, which really bothered me. I tried to contact the seller to get one, but they refused which is whatever I suppose. The bracelet is way to big for my wrist, even with it clipped to the absolute smallest setting. The bird charm fell off the first time I wore it, thankfully it was in the bottom of my bag so I can fix it. Didn&#x27;t find the bracelet to be stiff though and it is very cute. If you have small wrist don&#x27;t buy, it is just a pain</li>
    <li> my bracelet is great ! not too big , i was afraid it might be !!  i cant wait to order more of these !!</li>
    <li> It fell apart the first time I wore it.  The ring connecting the owls fell off.  I can fix it, but it still bummed me out.</li>
    <li> The little birdie charm fell off within the first hour I wore it, but amazingly, the rest has stayed together.  It was large enough even for my larger wrist, so that was also a pleasant suprise.  So far the product has not fallen apart.  It was definitely worth the three dollars I paid for it.</li>
    <li> This bracelet broke the first time that I wore it. It was cheap but I didn&#x27;t expect it to break after a couple hours.</li>
    <li> Cheaply made. The little bird fell off within an hour of me wearing it. I mean, I expect to get cheaply made jewelry because that&#x27;s what I order but this was lower than my expectations.</li>
    <li> I bought three of these in different colors. The are hard to put on, I mean, you have to have someone put them on for you. One of mine came needing repair. The clasp was broken, the other two were fine. The bracelets are unique and stylish. Just can&#x27;t put them on by myself. Nice for a gift, just tell them to check the clasp and have someone put them on.</li>
    <li> It looks identical to the picture! It is such a beautiful piece. It&#x27;s very sturdy and I&#x27;m impressed with the quality. It came within 2 weeks of ordering! So happy!</li>
    <li> But what else did you expect for the price. Wasn&#x27;t gonna be a piece of Tiffany&#x27;s fine merchandise. Looks better in the picture.</li>
    <li> This was a good buy for the price. I wasn&#x27;t sure when I ordered it if I would like all those bracelets but it is put together well and is nice to wear.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit big for my small wrist, but most are for me....I still REALLY like the bracelet. It&#x27;s just like the photo shows.</li>
    <li> These really cheap nice looking products are hit and miss. Sometimes when I have ordered stuff and it comes from China so takes like 2 weeks plus they are in pretty good condition. This time for this bracelet it is all broken, the clasps are not together, so I am going to have to have my husband take a look at them.</li>
    <li> I love Owls. The silver in the bracelet isn&#x27;t as shiny as it seems in the photo, but it&#x27;s still cute. My silver seems a bit tarnished, but I still wear it. The bracelet isn&#x27;t super durable, but it&#x27;s totally worth the price. I&#x27;d definitely buy another one.</li>
    <li> Yes Its Nice,I will Wear it Alot ,I love the color with the silver !! I also like the variety .</li>
    <li> The bracelet is really cute, but bad quality. It lasted less than 2 minutes. I put it on in the kitchen, walked to the living room, picked up my daughter and it fell right off. The clasp had cleanly snapped at the end of the bracelet. I wish it would have been different, because I liked it otherwise.</li>
    <li> I was a bit hesitant to order this but I love this bracelet! It came exactly as I ordered! Very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I guess I shouldn&#x27;t have expected much for the cheap price. You get what you pay for here. I will give this to my 7 year old niece.</li>
    <li> Cheaply made. Too big. Won&#x27;t be ordering something like this again.  took about a month to receive. pics are much better than real product.</li>
    <li> she got the bracelet i didn&#x27;t know it had come in until my daughter call me @ told that it came about a week ago it was 4 my grand daughter 2 wear 2 the dance it was just right the color @ everything she loves it</li>
    <li> I love this bracelet! the color is beautiful. The bird, owl and leaves make this a very charming piece of jewelry.</li>
    <li> This bracelet is really well made and looks just as great as the picture shown. I am very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Cheaply made. But was very inexpensive, so no problem.  Will wear until it falls apart.  I would not purchase any more.</li>
    <li> It was just like the picture showed.  My daughter loves owls so it was a great gift for her to receive</li>
    <li> excellent product for the price, shipping takes awhile to get but if you are not in a hurry, it is well worth the price and wait.</li>
    <li> My son broke it in 2 different places within 5 minutes of wearing it. It is too large for smaller wrists.</li>
    <li> I like the colors and silver designs. However, when I received mine, the clip was missing. Decided to cut it apart and use on beaded bracelets I made.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice bracelet for the price...got it for my granddaughters birthday and she was very pleased with it....wish I had bought two</li>
    <li> Made in.... makes a difference to me, and I did not check until it arrived. My bad. Nothing was wrong with this product, just my personal preference</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and it broke. The bird charm came off and the chains broke off! What a rip-off!! Don&#x27;t get this, save your money and buy something else!</li>
    <li> Very very cute.  My sister&#x27;s 11 year old grand-daughter loved it.  The price was very low.  I bought two because for that price, I didn&#x27;t know if it will last.</li>
    <li> looks nicer in picture.  This was cheap and looks cheap</li>
    <li> I ordered two of the brackets for my nieces! They loved them.  Good material and very true to size and colors.</li>
    <li> It worked out perfectly. the day before I planned on giving it to her one of her old bracelets with the same color blue on it broke and she was sad because that color was going to match her outfit perfectly so I ran and gave her this one and it was just the right gift</li>
    <li> I love this bracelet. It&#x27;s so cute, but it Brock the first day I wore it</li>
    <li> The owl fell off when I took it out of the package.  Additionally, the cords used in production are very stiff and don&#x27;t lay easily on your wrist.</li>
    <li> Look nice with my any dress. Very cute and stand out!</li>
    <li> Bracelets are just as shown. Really cute!</li>
    <li> Not as large as it looks in picture...other than size it is exactly as pictured.</li>
    <li> Not like the picture at all!!! All my leather was brown, and not the same metal is pictured.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> Very nice! Great price!</li>
