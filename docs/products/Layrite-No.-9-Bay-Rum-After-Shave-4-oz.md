### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This bay rum smells great!  </li>
      <li>product itself wasn&#x27;t very good.</li>
      <li>Smells wonderful and has a great feel on the face.  </li>
      <li>But regardless it&#x27;s a great product</li>
      <li>Works great, smells great.</li>
      <li>Great stuff, great scent.</li>
      <li>This is certainly a good smelling bay rum cologne.</li>
      <li>There is a good amount of Bay in there as well as clove.</li>
      <li>My boyfriend has been using this stuff for years, the scent is so good.</li>
      <li>This is really good bay rum aftershave.</li>
      <li>Much better than clubman, not as good as Dominican, or captains choice but for the availability and cost it hits the spot.  </li>
      <li>More clove accents, good value if you consider shipping costs.</li>
      <li>It lacks any longevity, and the nice scent it leaves is gone in minutes.</li>
      <li>Gabel&#x27;s is also similar in scent and might be the best bang for the buck</li>
      <li>after I get done with these two bottles will probably buy more.</li>
      <li>It seems to heal my face after shaving better than anything else I have tried.</li>
      <li>Really glad I bought it.</li>
      <li>The bottle says Layrite No.9, not &amp;#34;World Famous Hawleywood&#x27;s No.9&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad the bottle has a stopper so</li>
      <li>I like it better than &#x27;Captain&#x27;s Choice&#x27;.</li>
      <li>What more do you want?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Smells great too and the scent does fade pretty quickly so it won&#x27;t interfere with your favorite aftershave.</li>
      <li>This aftershave is good enough to replace my beloved Dominica bay rum.</li>
      <li>Spicy, clean, sexy scent from a cool &amp; refreshing after shave!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other bay rum scented after shaves, this is the best!</li>
      <li>Wayyyyy easy choice.</li>
      <li>The scent isn&#x27;t strong unless she is close in there and to me</li>
      <li>But it does linger lightly and isn&#x27;t obnoxious at all.</li>
      <li>It is a clean smell, strong cloves.</li>
      <li>The smell is of bay (pimenta racemosa), light clove and vanilla.  </li>
      <li>I like this as much as the best bay rum out there however it is different than the Caribbean version.</li>
      <li>love the clove smell (not too strong), and it&#x27;s not overpowering as a whole.</li>
      <li>This is a nice medium to light scent that reminds me of old school barbering.</li>
      <li>I tried this Bay Rum because it had so many positive reviews.</li>
      <li>The whole product line is fantastic!  </li>
      <li>This is where a modern cap would be more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>After using for a while, I have to say this stuff is not bad for the price.  </li>
      <li>Not a must-buy but still worthy of your money if you like bay rum.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Dominica is still my favorite, but this is a nice scent never the less.</li>
      <li>The smell I got from bottle was overwhelming of cinnamon and not much else and upon application to the skin it kind of became almost woody/musty smelling, maybe even like an old sweater.</li>
      <li>It is refreshing, and does deliver an invigorating, but brief burn.</li>
      <li>The label is pretty hip/cool.</li>
      <li>Their response was to send a non personable email asking for &amp;#34;proof&amp;#34; of damage with photos and an affidavit to be filled out before they would take any action.</li>
      <li>, the old style bottle looks cool, but even though the cap was taped for shipment, it still managed to leak a bit in transit.</li>
      <li>After Shave Lotion, pretty much the standard in barber shops everywhere, because I love that classic scent.</li>
      <li>seeing it&#x27;s a large bottle.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall this is a nice aftershave, but I wish it had a tad less clove, and more of it&#x27;s other ingredients.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s the whole idea.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this aftershave!</li>
      <li>There is no serious burn from this aftershave, I&#x27;d say mild/medium.</li>
      <li>Love the scent, spicy and basic, not overpowering like commercial brands.</li>
      <li>but maybe it just my particular body chemistry.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended for bay rum lovers.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Another note worth mentioning is the current shipment being shipped by Maxton_Men</li>
      <li>The price is pretty high for only 4 oz.</li>
      <li>it is that&#x27;s a pretty big concern to</li>
      <li>The scent is quite light and doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
      <li>My 45 year old son loves this after shave.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s old school and all but not practical.</li>
      <li>It comes in an old school glass bottle if that means anything to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>A review mentioned this bay rum as being similar to Dominica, and while both are supposed to be bay rums, Hawleywood&#x27;s is much more clove heavy.</li>
      <li>The product smells terrific and is new to me.</li>
      <li>This one burns very little (at least for an alcohol aftershave) and now with a good DE razor</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t burn that bad after a shave, great scent also.</li>
      <li>Upon closer examination, I saw that the top of the cap was dented which might or might not have caused the seal to get broken causing the leak.</li>
      <li>I wish the scent lasted a little longer but the price is reasonable enough to apply plenty of extra product.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My 45 year old son loves this after shave.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, great scent.</li>
    <li> This is a nice medium to light scent that reminds me of old school barbering.</li>
    <li> I give Hawleywood&#x27;s No. 9 Bay Rum 4 stars. The price is pretty high for only 4 oz. It comes in an old school glass bottle if that means anything to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is similar to Dominica but more artificial. Some people say this has a cloves smell but I&#x27;m not sure. There&#x27;s no glycerin so it isn&#x27;t tacky like Master. The scent is quite light and doesn&#x27;t last long. The majority of bay rums don&#x27;t last long though. There is no serious burn from this aftershave, I&#x27;d say mild/medium. I&#x27;m glad the bottle has a stopper so not too much comes out/gets wasted. I&#x27;ve found the label to be a little slippery and almost dropped it several times with both wet and dry hands, at the price it is that&#x27;s a pretty big concern to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients are: SD Alcohol 40, Water, Sucrose, Octacetate, Bay Oil, FD&amp;C Yellow No.5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t have to listen to rockabilly (1950&#x27;s rock and roll) to use this stuff. The label is pretty hip/cool. Not a must-buy but still worthy of your money if you like bay rum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hawleywood&#x27;s is included on my Listmania list of over 40 different bay rum aftershaves if you want to check it out. People are always searching for bay rum and talking about it so I thought I&#x27;d do a roundup to help people out and let them know what is out there.</li>
    <li> Spicy, clean, sexy scent from a cool &amp; refreshing after shave!  I&#x27;ve tried other bay rum scented after shaves, this is the best!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend has been using this stuff for years, the scent is so good. Highly recommend this aftershave!</li>
    <li> I tried this Bay Rum because it had so many positive reviews. A review mentioned this bay rum as being similar to Dominica, and while both are supposed to be bay rums, Hawleywood&#x27;s is much more clove heavy. I find them totally different. It is refreshing, and does deliver an invigorating, but brief burn. The bad thing about Hawleywood&#x27;s is the scent fades especially fast, and it&#x27;s gone within minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another note worth mentioning is the current shipment being shipped by Maxton_Men is different than what&#x27;s pictured. The bottle says Layrite No.9, not &amp;#34;World Famous Hawleywood&#x27;s No.9&amp;#34; which is what&#x27;s pictured in the description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last, the old style bottle looks cool, but even though the cap was taped for shipment, it still managed to leak a bit in transit. That&#x27;s something to consider when packing this in your travel bag. This is where a modern cap would be more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a nice aftershave, but I wish it had a tad less clove, and more of it&#x27;s other ingredients. It lacks any longevity, and the nice scent it leaves is gone in minutes. Dominica is still my favorite, but this is a nice scent never the less. I don&#x27;t find them similar though, as this is clove scented and Dominica is not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is also a Bay Rum called &amp;#34;Suavecito&amp;#34; that smells just like this. The bottle is the same, and the color of the aftershave is even identical. Might be the same maker, and it&#x27;s a couple of dollars less. Gabel&#x27;s is also similar in scent and might be the best bang for the buck seeing it&#x27;s a large bottle.</li>
    <li> This is certainly a good smelling bay rum cologne. It is affordable and lasts all day. I will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> This rating is for both the product and the seller which was Beautogen. When the bottle arrived it was leaking or had leaked all over the bubble wrap it came in. Upon closer examination, I saw that the top of the cap was dented which might or might not have caused the seal to get broken causing the leak. About 1/6 of the product had been lost so I contact the seller and told them what I had found. Their response was to send a non personable email asking for &amp;#34;proof&amp;#34; of damage with photos and an affidavit to be filled out before they would take any action. Seemed like a lot of work for such a thing but I went ahead and did it just as they asked but to date have received no reply as to what they are going to do about it. Tired of waiting, I contacted Amazon via phone and they are going to take care of it and will refund my money in just a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself wasn&#x27;t very good. The smell I got from bottle was overwhelming of cinnamon and not much else and upon application to the skin it kind of became almost woody/musty smelling, maybe even like an old sweater. Certainly not what i was hoping for but maybe it just my particular body chemistry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not loving this aftershave&#x27;s scent. I&#x27;ve been using Pinaud&#x27;s Clubman After Shave Lotion, pretty much the standard in barber shops everywhere, because I love that classic scent. Hoping this after shave would be in that realm, I tried it, but didn&#x27;t like it. My girlfriend described the scent as &amp;#34;old christmas tree&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> This is really good bay rum aftershave. I like it better than &#x27;Captain&#x27;s Choice&#x27;. Really glad I bought it. If you like bay rum you will like this.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and has a great feel on the face.  The smell is of bay (pimenta racemosa), light clove and vanilla.  Highly recommended for bay rum lovers.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t burn that bad after a shave, great scent also.</li>
    <li> This bay rum smells great!  The whole product line is fantastic!  If you buy the rum, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  Do it!</li>
    <li> After using for a while, I have to say this stuff is not bad for the price.  Much better than clubman, not as good as Dominican, or captains choice but for the availability and cost it hits the spot.  Wife likes the scent and so do I .  after I get done with these two bottles will probably buy more.</li>
    <li> Works great, smells great. What more do you want?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the clove smell (not too strong), and it&#x27;s not overpowering as a whole.</li>
    <li> Love the scent, spicy and basic, not overpowering like commercial brands. It seems to heal my face after shaving better than anything else I have tried.</li>
    <li> I am on my second bottle.  It is a clean smell, strong cloves. It isn&#x27;t a thin, cheap Bay Rum.  I wish the scent lasted a little longer but the price is reasonable enough to apply plenty of extra product.  Have also seen it sold as Layrite No 9.  I will keep buying it.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re like me and of African descent or any ethnicity that struggles with ingrown hairs you have to try this. The reason that aftershaves that have alcohol in them fell out of favor was the initial sting/burn that accompanies the application of them. This one burns very little (at least for an alcohol aftershave) and now with a good DE razor I get NO razor bumps. Look those things are a week of hell vs a second of sting.... Wayyyyy easy choice. Smells great too and the scent does fade pretty quickly so it won&#x27;t interfere with your favorite aftershave.</li>
    <li> I like this as much as the best bay rum out there however it is different than the Caribbean version. More clove accents, good value if you consider shipping costs. This aftershave is good enough to replace my beloved Dominica bay rum.</li>
    <li> Look forward to splashing this on my face every day</li>
    <li> I went to the shop itself in HB to buy it. Looking forward to getting a cut and shave from them. The product smells terrific and is new to me. I never used aftershave until I was browsing around the internet looking for pomades. Now I am hooked on this stuff. The scent isn&#x27;t strong unless she is close in there and to me that&#x27;s the whole idea. But it does linger lightly and isn&#x27;t obnoxious at all. There is a good amount of Bay in there as well as clove. The bottle is glass which I wish it weren&#x27;t. I had a bottle of the Suavecito brand aftershave that is very similar and it was knocked over and shattered before I even got to use it! It&#x27;s old school and all but not practical. But regardless it&#x27;s a great product and I always look forward to using it.</li>
