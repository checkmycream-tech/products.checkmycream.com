      <li>This razor looks and feels great</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Norelco&#x27;s with great satisfaction for 15+ years.</li>
      <li>br /&gt;I am thoroughly impressed with this latest model.  </li>
      <li>The Panasonic&#x27;s cleaning system, like the Braun Activator&#x27;s, is superior to the Norelco 9170XLCC&#x27;s.   </li>
      <li>I got this as a birthday gift for my partner and he absolutely loved it.  </li>
      <li>I gave it a shot and loved it too and decided to get one for myself.  </li>
      <li>For the price, I guessed it gave a really good shave.  </li>
      <li>We have decided that the results he gets with this shaver are so good that he will not be using the disposable razors anymore.  </li>
      <li>I do like the shaver though and got it for a good price on Amazon</li>
      <li>Which is good, because the charger circuit has been pulled out of the razor body and into a wall wart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>And I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe the great, comfortable shave I get with it.  </li>
      <li>Then to top that off, changed the drive pin design so that one can NOT use the superior heads.  </li>
      <li>The razor is good but not any better than the cheaper models.  </li>
      <li>I personally liked the case.</li>
      <li>However, the Norelco 9170XL is so much more superior</li>
      <li>I liked the idea you could lock the on/off switch.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t own a Norelco triple-head razor, stop reading now and just buy one -- any one.  </li>
      <li>I am 100% impressed with the quality of the new and improved three row blade shaving system.</li>
      <li>He also likes the self cleaning part; it is very easy.  </li>
      <li>the plus side, the battery life on this razor is excellent, and longer than old Norelcos.  </li>
      <li>This does the best job of any I have used thus far.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Norelcos since the early 1980&#x27;s and this is the best I&#x27;ve had yet.  </li>
      <li>The razor is better than my old Norelco electric razor and the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
      <li>It is a very comfortable razor to use.</li>
      <li>So far he has been very impressed with the results - he does not impress easily.  </li>
      <li>and I found that the shave was very superior to my old Norelco from 5 years ago.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It does a better job over bumps and corners.  </li>
      <li>More reason to toss the cleaning unit.  </li>
      <li>Just received it and used it and can only say it is the Greatest Shaver EVER !!!!!!!!!</li>
      <li>I am pleased with the product and the way Amazon delivered with speed and accuracy</li>
      <li>more than just the heads sell for here.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I got this for Christmas 2005 and love it.</li>
      <li>so I happen to love this one.  </li>
      <li>I do feel that you will be satisfied too.</li>

      <li>shipping) from a famous online auction site (part of the name rhymed with Kay).  </li>
      <li>I was completely satisfied with that.</li>
      <li>and I instantly bought it, best shaver for over all (face, neck, and chin).</li>
      <li>It just seems to catch the many stuble on my face that go in many directions.   </li>
      <li>so I just put the Jet Cleaner in storage (maybe it should go in the trash :))</li>
      <li>It has 50% more shaving surface vs. 1 ring head.  </li>
      <li>I know because it tells me how many  minutes</li>
      <li>I have been an exclusive Norelco user for more than 50 years.</li>
      <li>Then I went to cordless that lasted for more than a decade and never replaced any part in it either, then it just stopped working.</li>
      <li>I love this one cause of how close and</li>
      <li>Mostly Norelco&#x27;s, but also Braun&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d rather put that kind of money toward some computer or camera gear than use this 9170 XLCC with clean system.</li>
      <li>The 8825xl glides smoothly over my skin -very easily, but the shaving time takes forever.</li>
      <li>Let me tell you about the good first.  </li>
      <li>Very nice, and would highly recomend it.</li>
      <li>Norelco had done a great job before by creating a recessed button on my old razor, but now this button that sticks out can snag on anything.  </li>
      <li>But if, like me, you have an old model, do your utmost to replace its parts and you&#x27;ll be just as happy.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this shaver (9170XLCC) to replace a Quadra which had seen better days (about 8 years), and I was not disappointed.  </li>
      <li>I think if the holder was made of metal, this wearing of the area which holds the heads in place would not occur as easily.</li>
      <li>Maintenance is easy too.</li>
      <li>Since most shaver shops want more than these are worth to repair or replace parts anymore, they are all disposable.</li>
      <li>power switch easy to turn off during shaving &lt;br</li>
      <li>- Easy cleaning.</li>
      <li>Bought it about 4 years ago and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
      <li>Did not realize when purchasing what was coming,(should have been more thorough when reading product description), huge box with multi apparatus for keeping shaver clean and sharpened.</li>
      <li>WORKS FINE</li>
      <li>The self cleaning part works fine also</li>
      <li>The Norelco 9170XLCC is the best I&#x27;ve ever owned and that goes back to my first Norelco in 1955 and includes a lots of Norelcos and others since.</li>
      <li>Or if you own an ancient Norelco double-header, or a triple-header before the Lift&#x27;n&#x27;Cut heads, sure, get a new one.  </li>
      <li>just got my replacement and while the shaver is still great, I am having the same problem.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a close smooth shave and</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cheaply made.  </li>
      <li>The shaver has a junky, cheap feel to it.  </li>
      <li>The shaving was by no means smooth.</li>
      <li>The shave is close, and is comfortable.  </li>
      <li>I did not feel the 9170 looked or felt cheap.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s a cheap way to get a spare battery, too.</li>
      <li>The newer pivoting head is great as it does help the transition from face to neck and catches the hairs a lot quicker than the multiple passes I had to make with the Noreclo Spectra</li>
      <li>One great feature is the digital read out on the front of the razor.</li>
      <li>- Have the razor heads glide lightly over your skin.  </li>
      <li>It is easy to clean plust</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I first purchased the Cool Skin 7775 model and was impressed by its shaving performance, although I learned that minimal pressure was a MUST to avoid neckline irritation. The main drawback was that a mixture of shaving lotion and stubble would run down the front of my chest while shaving in the shower. It was annoying, not pleasing to look at, and uncomfortable. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;     The next razor I purchased was the Norelco Spectra (James Bond) model. The handle was comfortable, the display was superior, but the shaving performance was less than my previous Cool Skin model. I looked as if I still had a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow after shaving with it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;     I purchased the 9170XLCC SmartTouch-XL Jet Clean Men&#x27;s shaving system 6 weeks ago from Amazon. I was extremely disappointed to say the least! The shaving was by no means smooth. The slots seemed to make the shaver drag over my face instead of capturing the facial hair and cutting close. I found the Smart Touch feature to be inadequate and gimmicky, adding no improvement to the actual shaver performance. The LCD display was not improved upon from previous LCD models, but the Jet Clean system was the final blow.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;     The Jet Clean system has no fan or heat induction system. As a result, the Jet Clean solution remained as a sudsy film on the outside of the razor heads even after 24 hours of non usage and air drying. The feeling of the cleaning solution running down my face while shaving was not pleasant, and ultimately dried my face up. I followed the directions to the letter. I gave my face/beard over 4 weeks to adjust, but was let down by the shaver&#x27;s performance. I tried rinsing the razor head assembly with hot water after the Jet Clean cycle was complete, but an improvement in cutting performance and a smoother shave were not achieved.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;     I now have a 6 week old 9170XLCC SmartTouch-XL stored away in a box waiting for my next garage sale. I was loyal to Norelco untill this shaver. It seems as if Norelco has become more concerned about providing gimmicks to sell razors than to improve the actual shaver performance. Their last three shaver models have regressed in quality and performance. I have switched to the new Panasonic Vortex which I purchased two days ago at Sharper Image. It&#x27;s superior to anything I&#x27;ve tried previously after only the initial shave, but it&#x27;s quite expensive. The Panasonic&#x27;s cleaning system, like the Braun Activator&#x27;s, is superior to the Norelco 9170XLCC&#x27;s.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t own a Norelco triple-head razor, stop reading now and just buy one -- any one.  Or if you own an ancient Norelco double-header, or a triple-header before the Lift&#x27;n&#x27;Cut heads, sure, get a new one.  But if, like me, you have an old model, do your utmost to replace its parts and you&#x27;ll be just as happy.  (I replaced heads and two solder-tab NiCd&#x27;s.) Here&#x27;s why (echoing other reviewers&#x27; sentiments):&lt;br /&gt;(i) This particular model is no faster than my old one, its \\&quot;Speed XL\\&quot; moniker notwithstanding.  Maybe that&#x27;s because of the new blade size/design, or maybe the old motor turns faster. (Seemingly, old AC and NiCd models spin faster than old NiMH models; YMMV.)&lt;br /&gt;(ii) This model is no more adjustable (N/M/S) for closeness of shave than my old adjustable model (1-10).  The heads do indeed rock more than the old spring suspension, but I still must stretch my skin with the other hand to get a close shave over the bumps.&lt;br /&gt;(iii) The cleaning system leaves stubble-grit on the rubber bits.  Also mine required repairs after 5 months, because the washer mechanism got stuck.  (It has a 2-year warranty (yay!), alas they insisted on shipping the razor back, too (aargh!).)  Norelco&#x27;s attempt to \\&quot;Gillette up a revenue stream\\&quot; with consumables, i.e. cleanser fluid, is a little transparent.&lt;br /&gt;(iv) The cleaning system leaves you with a damp razor, even if you shake it and let it stand for an entire day -- it&#x27;s the shaving equivalent of a wet willie in the morning.  Worse, the small quantity of liquid remaining is just enough to create a jumpy slide across the face -- not as even as completely dry, nor as smooth as a lubricated wet shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, the battery life on this razor is excellent, and longer than old Norelcos.  If you live out of a suitacase, you won&#x27;t have to pack the cord.  Which is good, because the charger circuit has been pulled out of the razor body and into a wall wart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor rates 4 stars (not 5 because they have made better razors before, and hopefully will hence).  The cleaning system gets 1 star.  So don&#x27;t get a CC model, but definitely do buy a Norelco razor.  If you switch from blade or foil electric, please do as the manual says: give it two weeks of rotary use before judging the closeness of the shave.  But especially if it&#x27;s your first razor, grasshopper, you will be hooked for life!e, and hopefully will hence).  The cleaning system gets 1 star.

    <li> I have personally tried this along side the Braun and Panasonic. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;PROS: quiet, self cleaning, can rinse the open head to remove hairs &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;CONS:  &lt;br /&gt;(1) weak shaver - feels like it had a hard time cutting my beard (not all that thick) so that I had to go over areas several times &lt;br /&gt;(2) power switch easy to turn off during shaving &lt;br /&gt;(3) particles of hair stick to rubberize parts</li>
    <li> I purchased the Norelco 9170XLCC in June of 2006.  I had 3 warranty claims during the 24 month warranty period for the same problem; the cheap rubber spindle that attaches to the razor heads broke 3 times, each time after exactly 6 months of use, rendering the shaver usless. After the final claim, exactly 6 months later it broke again, this time out of warranty.  I Emailed Norelco and their response was to provide various service centers where I could send it and pay for repairs.  I refuse to pay for a repair of a product that lasts only 6 months.  I gave up and now use a Braun.  It is a shame as this was my fourth Norelco shaver and unfortunhately the least durable.     Mike</li>
    <li> Bought it about 4 years ago and it&#x27;s still going strong. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the best ever made, but razors have to be paired up with each individual person and their skin type. If you are already looking at this razor to buy it, go for it, as long as you get a good price. Buying additional cleaning solution is inconvenient, but you could easily mix some alcohol and water, or some other Internet remedy for cheap. If your skin can take electric razors and you prefer rotary to the vibrating, this will do the trick. Just remember to change the blades as often as necessary, or you&#x27;ll think it&#x27;s a bad buy.</li>
    <li> I HAVE HAD OTHER LESS EXPENSIVE MODELS OF NOTELCO RAZORS FOR OVER 30 YEARS AND I DO NOT FEEL THAT THE DIFFERENCE IN COSTS IS WORTH THE HIGH PRICE.</li>
    <li> I started out as a Norelco guy in the 80&#x27;s then switched to Braun for the next 15 years, then tried this shaver at my brothers house and I instantly bought it, best shaver for over all (face, neck, and chin).</li>
    <li> The new continual shaver cleaning system seems to be an excuse to justify the continuing need to purchase and resupply Norelco name-brand cleaning fluid when water as used in the past will do.... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The new angle of shaver presentation to my face is less effective and convenient than the old.... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The new blade cutting system is FAR MORE EFFECTIVE AND QUICKER.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for a friend. He says it dosen&#x27;t shave much better than his old norelco that he bought for 60 dollars! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Save your money and get a cheaper one.</li>
    <li> Got this for xmas for my husband. He&#x27;s not really all that happy with it. It ended up breaking 3 months after he got it..and it was out of warranty. I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Always been a loyal Norelco fan.  This product disappoints.  I&#x27;ve used this shaving system for over a year. (too expensive to throw away).  Every day I use it, I get disappointed, I have to shave the same area of my face over &amp; over again to get a clean shave.  The previous Norelco shavers I had were much better.  The cleaning &amp; charging device stopped working 6 months ago.  Just waiting for the shaver to go so that I can buy another shaver..... NOT NORELCO.</li>
    <li> The razor is the best yet.I&#x60;ve used them for almost 50 years.The cleaning system is something else;It didn&#x60;t work and i had to send the whole set back.It&#x60;s been about two weeks and no razor.Can&#x60;t wait to get it back.</li>
    <li> Terrifc razor, and one I would buy again.  But I would buy it without the cleaning system.  While the cleaner does give the razor a \\&quot;New\\&quot; feeling when you use it, it is bulky and inconvenient to store and expensive to run considering the liquid usage.</li>
    <li> Just received it and used it and can only say it is the Greatest Shaver EVER !!!!!!!!! &lt;br /&gt; The closest Shave, No Razor Burn, Fastest shave Yet And very quite. &lt;br /&gt; Thank You Norelco for this Great Saver. JD</li>
    <li> This is my first Norelco.  I read a lot of bad and good review and I still decided to get it.  I won&#x27;t say it is bad but not as good as I would think by comparing with other electric kind.  Never compare with the manual one.</li>
    <li> WORKS FINE I,ve even sent one back for warranty work they sent me a new one.I got my Dad,Brother one too they like it.......</li>
    <li> I am giving this 3 stars although mine is broken.  Let me tell you about the good first.  The cleaning system is pretty cool, and works well.  I just wish the liquid didn&#x27;t evaporate so quickly.  &amp;lt;Hint, if you want to have your liquid last a while, put only about 1/5 of the bottle in at a time, you&#x27;ll only clean the razor about once a month anyway, and it will evaporate in about 2 weeks.&gt;  But it being part alcohol - that makes sense that it evaporates.  The shave is close, although rough on the skin.  The head doesn&#x27;t move as smoothly along my face as my old norelco.  Another positive is that is uses the same recharging cable as my old norelco (I think all norelco chargers are the same).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the bad.  At home, this razor was perfect.  It has about 80 minutes of juice in it and i only need to charge it about once every 3 months, since I have a secondary norelco I keep in my gym bag and use that one when I&#x27;m at work.  My secondary battery finally wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge, so I had to replace it with my new 9170XLCC.  Well, every time I would take it out of my gym bag, the head would be popped open.  This is because the button to open the head actually sticks out from the body, and anything can snag it and it will spring open.  You don&#x27;t even need to &#x27;press&#x27; the button, you just need to touch it.  Well, today it was, as usual, popped open.  The only difference now is that it won&#x27;t close.  It probably twisted a little while in the open position and now the blades are unaligned with the head, and it won&#x27;t snap shut.  I can get a piece of tape and tape it shut, which works, but that is not the point.  Norelco had done a great job before by creating a recessed button on my old razor, but now this button that sticks out can snag on anything.  Not only is it bad in the sense that the head can twist when popped open, but I also have little hairs all over the bottom of my bag because it kept popping open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that&#x27;s my review - it worked as a razor, but don&#x27;t plan on travelling with it.  Even when you place it in a glove box/cupholder, that head will manage to pop open.  It was a poor design flaw and I&#x27;m very disappointed that norelco would send something out like this without any type of travel-testing.  I mean, what&#x27;s the point of a cordless razor if you can&#x27;t take it anywhere with you?ravelling with it.  Even when you place it in a glove box/cupholder, that head will manage to pop open.  It was a poor design flaw and I&#x27;m very disappointed that norelco would send something out like this without any type of travel-testing.

    <li> The newer pivoting head is great as it does help the transition from face to neck and catches the hairs a lot quicker than the multiple passes I had to make with the Noreclo Spectra I had that it is replacing. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The shaving is much quicker too, took me about 4 minutes with the Spectra with new blades to get a full shave while the 9170 is about 2 minutes.  It just seems to catch the many stuble on my face that go in many directions.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The cleaning system works fine, just as long as you change the fluid as stated.  I like using the cleaning system better than rinsing under hot water like I had to do with the spectra.  It is less of my time needed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am thoroughly impressed with this latest model.  I bought the Spectra before because I wanted to be able to adjust the razor tension for my sensitive skin, this new model does this also, but my face seems less prone to irritation with the settings set to a firmer one, given than I need less time for the razors to pass over my face.</li>
    <li> The razor is good but not any better than the cheaper models.  See the Norelco website for the full product line and prices.</li>
    <li> My 9170XL is only 7 months old, and it has fallen apart twice already due to a design flaw. The hinge holding together the heads to the body is made of a rapidly rusting metal that stiffens and breaks off. For such an expensive shaver, one would think the company would spring for a non-corrosive hinge. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The shaver, after two weeks (as it says in the instructions) gives me a very good shave. If only it wouldn&#x27;t keep falling apart. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Pete Giambalvo (California)</li>
    <li> I had a Norelco razor 6826 which I bought five or six years ago. I was completely satisfied with that. Then I dropped it and broke the razor head carriage. It became impossible to use. I read about the 9170XL which was rated #1 by Consumer Reports, so I ordered from Amazon at a deeply discounted price. I love it. It shaves much closer than my old Norelco. Technology has improved. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. It functions much more smoothly than my older razor.</li>
    <li> It has been a long time since i used an electric shaver, and forgot how nice they can be.  Never had one that does the job this one does.  Guess that&#x27;s tech improvements over the years.  I love this one cause of how close and well it shaves.  It is easy to clean plust the cleaner it has with it.  Very nice, and would highly recomend it.</li>
    <li> I have been a long time Norelco shaver user.  When it was time to buy a new set of Series 7 Lift-and-Cut heads for my old Norelco 6885XL razor, I decided to get the new 9170XLCC razor.  Big Mistake!  The new 3-ring Smart Touch heads are not as good as the old reliable Lift-and-Cut heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why you say?  To make the head look like it has more surface area and thus should cut faster, the Norelo engineers reduced the cutting area of the fastest, outer, ring, to squeeze in the two inner, but slower surface speed, rings.  In fact the outer ring cutting blades are only 1.00 mm wide as opposted the the 1.75 mm width cutter width in the series 7 Lift-and-Cut heads.  The added inner rings actually cause pulling of the beard hairs if you try to shave at the same speed you did with the older models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the Way, the so-called cleaning system is a big bother and not worth the extra cost.  You can rinse the 9170XL under the faucet just like the older XL models. In fact, you HAVE TO rinse it because of the sticky mess the cleaning system leaves in the razor after \\&quot;cleaning.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line:  In a failed attempt to make a quieter, faster, shaving system, Norelco actually made it WORSE than earlier lift-and-cut models.  Then to top that off, changed the drive pin design so that one can NOT use the superior heads.  Do not waste your hard-earned cash on this sub-par Norelco product.</li>
    <li> I got this as a birthday gift for my partner and he absolutely loved it.  I gave it a shot and loved it too and decided to get one for myself.  I can&#x27;t believe the great, comfortable shave I get with it.  I highly recommend it for anyone regardless of skin sensitivity.</li>
    <li> Have used Norelco razors in the past. This does the best job of any I have used thus far.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Shaver for my Husband, he loves the way it gives you a close shave, he also like the fact it lets you know when the razor needs cleaning, than it will clean it for you.</li>
    <li> I upgraded from 8970XL. I have used Norelco razors for over 30 years and have always been happy. It continues with this model. I especially happy with the self cleaner.</li>
    <li> Did not realize when purchasing what was coming,(should have been more thorough when reading product description), huge box with multi apparatus for keeping shaver clean and sharpened. I personaly have no space or time to fuss with such an item. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Norelco 9170XLCC  Razor itself is extremely good, but as mentioned above, I was punished for not reading the print about what comes with it.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overkill for an electric razor that is too expensive for what the product is, and shame on me for impulsive buying the best that is not. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I tried to replace my old Norelco which worked pretty good.  I thought going with a new Norelco would be an upgrade--not so.  This thing is worse than my 5 year-old shaver.  It comes with a bunch of worthless junk (jet cleaning system?).  Worst of all, it rips the hair our of my face which obviously hurts!!  Don&#x27;t buy this thing, please!</li>
    <li> Made a major change in the model and cleaning system is a plus</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco razors for over 30 years and after trying the 9170 XLCC for a month, I can say it&#x27;s the best razor I&#x27;ve owned. The shave is no quicker than my previous model 6886 XL but the closeness and consistency of the shave is noticeably better. It is a very comfortable razor to use. I like the illuminated LCD panel and the non slip material on the hand grip works very well, even with wet hands. When you go on trips (without the Jet Clean system) just rinse the razor under the tap every few days and you&#x27;re good to go. I give the 9170 razor itself 4.5 stars. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Jet Clean system has worked well for me but admittedly it is not the elegant cleaning system that Braun offers. Norelco needs to learn from Braun&#x27;s razor cleaning system and produce a Jet Clean mark II than contains the fluids in a cartridge and sterilizes the heads. The other posts complaining about wet or sticky shaves are a result of those people not following the directions. After the two minute jet cleaning cycle is done, pop open the head and simply give the razor a light rinse under the tap to flush off the residual cleaning fluid. Leave the razor open to air dry and the next time you shave the razor is clean, dry and has a nice light hygienic smell. I think the razor shaves a bit smoother and closer with a daily jet clean and I enjoy that little luxury. I give the Jet Clean system 3.5 stars.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All in all I give a solid four star rating to the 9170 XLCC system and I recommend you buy it.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the product and the way Amazon delivered with speed and accuracy</li>
    <li> I have been an exclusive Norelco user for more than 50 years. When Target was selling replacement blades for my 8895xl(James Bond I think) for $38 and the 9170xlcc for $100 I bought it. Used it 30 days. I went from a 4 min shave to 5. The cleaning works but recharges the battery and makes a mess. Went from a 150 min battery(Li-on) to an 85 min battery. Went from a smooth feeling shave to a rough feeling shave. Shave not quite as close either. Who invents a cleaning system that you must plug and unplug everytime. No power switch. Went from a lousy snap cover to the first that stays on. Unfortunately, you can&#x27;t use it, as the stand won&#x27;t accept it.    I did not feel the 9170 looked or felt cheap. I liked the idea you could lock the on/off switch. I personally liked the case. Went from a curled cord to a straight cord. I went from a stand to dry the 8895 to no stand for the 9170. Both have fancy displays. Neither are useful. Neither has a decent trimmer. I read that the new Arcitec&#x27;s is worse.I went from a quiet razor to a slightly quieter one. I wonder if it&#x27;s motor speed.    In summary, Norelco Phillps has not been improving its line. I will stick with my old one until the sequel to the Arcitec (which has rather awful reviews so far)is out in several years, and buy new blades on the net.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recently purchased the HQ9160 model, which is almost the same as the 9170 except the 9160 does not have the jet cleaning system.  And I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product.  Here&#x27;s why.    Before switching to an electric shaver, I used the Mach 3 razor for over 5 years.  Over the years I find that my skin got more and more sensitive to manual shaving, probably because I always shave against the grain (of the hair).  Also, since I have acne problems, the razor blades often caused cuts that led to minor bleeding, which sometimes resulted in scarring.  After using the HQ9160 electric shaver, all of the problems involving the skin irration and the unwanted bleeding are gone.  And I think the electric shaver gives as close of a shave as my Mach 3 razors, especially in the upper neck area, near the throat.  Plus, with the irration problem now gone, I have the option of shaving again in the evenings before I go out.    TIPS to improve your electric shaving experience:  - Wash, clean and dry your face before shaving.  - Have the razor heads glide lightly over your skin.  Don&#x27;t press the heads hard against your skin - it makes the cutting worse. Instead, you should use your free hand to gently stretch the skin while you shave over the area.  - Take the heads out and use a degreasing liquid such as Philishave razor cleaner or rubbing alcohol to clean heads once a month.  - Lubricate the heads with a Philisahve shaving spray or a drop of mineral oil once a month.  - For extremely senstive skin, you may want to use a shaving powder or oil such as the Remington Face Saver Pre-Shave Powder Stick.    REASONS I chose the HQ9160 over other models and brands:  - Price.  I bought it for about $100USD (incl. shipping) from a famous online auction site (part of the name rhymed with Kay).  - Battery.  Its Lithium ion cell yields 90 minutes (~30 days) of shaving.  - Travel pouch.  - 3-ring head. It has 50% more shaving surface vs. 1 ring head.  - Contour head.  It does a better job over bumps and corners.  - Easy cleaning. Just rinse in hot water for a few seconds.</li>
    <li> Throughout my adult life, almost exclusively, I have used electric razors.  Mostly Norelco&#x27;s, but also Braun&#x27;s.  This new offering from Norelco gives a superior and fast shave.  The cutting surface of the razor doesn&#x27;t glide as easily across the face as some of the other Norelco&#x27;s but the quality of the shave is definitely worth this minor inconvenience.  Three minutes and I&#x27;m done.  Cleaning the razor in the jet clean unit produces a clean smelling unit each time it&#x27;s used.  I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> There is nothing wrong with the shaving system here--it shaves well, although you must move it more slowly across your beard, the shave is much quicker when you do.  It&#x27;s in the flashy electronics that Norelco has done another reverse-turn. Old Norelcos would \\&quot;beep\\&quot; for a few seconds and also show a blinking \\&quot;time to clean\\&quot; symbol until you opened the head (presumably do to so). Then the \\&quot;beep\\&quot; was removed in a later model and the cleaning indication on the screen only stayed lit for a minute or so--if you didn&#x27;t look at the screen, too bad. Now for this latest \\&quot;improvement\\&quot;(!), the cleaning indicator blinks after EVERY shave regardless if it needs cleaning or not. The instruction manual says on page 13 says it will blink \\&quot;about once a week\\&quot; and on page 22 that will blink \\&quot;after each shave\\&quot;. Believe page 22! If I have to clean out the head after every shave, shake it in a towel and let it air-dry on the counter-top, then I might as well go back to a blade &amp; foam--it&#x27;s about as much mess and trouble! The count-down \\&quot;minutes left\\&quot; feature has the annoying habit of starting a rapid decent when you switch off the shaver from 20 minutes or so remaining, suddenly to single digits--which again makes you have to physically look at the screen&#x27;s slowly appearing symbols after every shave. A row of \\&quot;pixels\\&quot; that form the numbers on the screen were not working to begin with making it a bit tricky to read some of the numbers (annoying, but not enough to send it back!). Norelco&#x27;s attempt to keep you purchasing their cleaning solution is a marketing-ploy. If you wash it out with warm water occasionally as instructed, you should only have to use the solution cleaning system when you re-charge it. The charger/cleaner base also has to be un-plugged when not in use &amp; there&#x27;s no provision for cord-storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A whole series of easily-fixed annoying \\&quot;niggles\\&quot; that make it much less than satisfactory (and I&#x27;m not even going to mention the lurid orange trim on the otherwise sleek stainless steel colored body shape!).  Buy it for the shaves, not for the \\&quot;bells &amp; whistles\\&quot;.k stainless steel colored body shape!).  Buy it for the shaves, not for the \\&quot;bells &amp; whistles\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Am I doing something wrong? Maybe pressing too hard while shaving? The folks at Norelco would not speculate. I have had my 9170 XLCC system for a year now. It gives me great shaves daily ... smooth and close. The problem is the head retainer plate or \\&quot;head holder\\&quot; P/N 422203611110. This is a plastic part and apparently wears after about 6 months of daily use. One or two of the heads will become dislocated while shaving and not \\&quot;float\\&quot; as they should. I am not sure how this happens, but to correct it is very difficult without taking the whole head assembly apart. I think if the holder was made of metal, this wearing of the area which holds the heads in place would not occur as easily. The part was covered under warranty, but was \\&quot;backordered\\&quot; and took over 2 months to receive. I am wondering if there is a high demand for this part. This system was designed well, but fell short with materials chosen.  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver (9170XLCC) to replace a Quadra which had seen better days (about 8 years), and I was not disappointed.  I ordered some extra cleaning solution for the new shaver but it was on back order and took almost 2 months to arrive, but that did not turn out to be a problem, since the solution which came with the shaver lasted long enough.  The shave is close, and is comfortable.  The cleaning feature is competent, but, in retrospect, not critical. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Robert A. Fink, M. D.</li>
    <li> Electric razors usually do not compete with a blade and shaving cream BUT this one does. The results of shaving with this electric razor is a close shave no stubble in 3 minutes ( heavy beard and neck hairs growing sideways it gets them all). I know because it tells me how many  minutes i used the razor and keeps track of how many minutes are left on one charge, about 60 minutes. The self cleaning part works fine also but every time you clean you also charge the batteries. Cleaning every fourth shave means the batteries are not nearly discharged. I am concerned they will get a short memory. Other than that its great.</li>
    <li> I PURCHASED THIS NORELCO CAUSE I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BEST SHAVE I&#x27;VE EVER HAD.  WRONG.  IT TENDS TO PULL THE HAIR QUIT OFTEN, THEN CUT IT.  NOT A HAPPY CAMPER.               DOUGLAS PREZZANO</li>
    <li> The first couple weeks I wasn&#x27;t sure about how close it shaved.  After a few weeks it definately gets better and the shave gets closer.  The only thing is that there must be a cheaper alternative to the jet clean solution.</li>
    <li> The razor is better than my old Norelco electric razor and the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned. I still have to pass over my jaw line and upper lip multiple times, but I have to do that with a manual razor. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The 9170XLCC shaves closer than my 12-year old Norelco, maybe just from having brand new shaving heads, and I have to pass over the problem areas less often: takes me 6 minutes to shave instead of 8 minutes (who invented the myth of the 3-minute shave?). I also had no razor burn and did not need an adjustment period, which I credit to my previous use of a Norelco shaver. Of course, every one&#x27;s face and beard is different, all I can say is that it works very well for me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As for the cleaning system, it seems like a lot of bulky equipment just to clean a shaver. I used it once, took over an hour, then had to rinse off the residue and wait once again for the razor head to dry. The cleaning cycle consumed 6 minutes of electrical charge (one less shave for me). It starts charging the razor if you don&#x27;t turn the cleaner off immediately when cleaning is done (questionable design when they say you should only charge when the batteries are near empty). I&#x27;ll probably use the cleaning system until the included bottle of cleaning fluid is gone, but I won&#x27;t be reordering the cleaning fluid. You can clean the razor just by rinsing with hot water or by using the included brush. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Final note, the included case is no where near as good as my old Norelco case, which has rigid edges and stiff sides for greater protection, and more room inside for shaver, cord and brush. I&#x27;m keeping my old case and using it for travel.</li>
    <li> The razor shaves pretty well, however, the cleaning unit did not function.  When I called Norelco they told me that the likely cause was a chip in the razor unit that was not \\&quot;communicating\\&quot; with the cleaning unit -- suggesting that it&#x27;s a problem that is not uncommon and that the company knows about.  The replacement procedures would take up to four weeks to get a replacement razor in my hands -- leaving me without the razor in the interem -- not a good way to keep you customers satisfied. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In addition, the razor uses three rubber shock absorbers that function well, but which I can see will wear down over time (and certainly well before any of the plastic components of the razor would wear out).  This is poor design in my opinion. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;These problems have led me to return the razor for a refund.  I&#x27;ve used Norelco razors for 30 years, but this is my last one.</li>
    <li> I happen to like rotary shavers as opposed to foil so I happen to love this one.  It&#x27;s quiet, shaves fast and keeps a charge for a long time.  I replaced a Braun foil which was a good shaver, but it was too loud and I didn&#x27;t like how hot it became after shaving for only a few seconds.  I also seemed to replace the foil more than necessary because it would break apart.  One thing Braun has perfected though is the cleaning system.  I don&#x27;t know if Norelco decided to rush some sort of cleaner into production to compete with Braun or if it&#x27;s just not as easy to design a cleaner for a rorary shaver, but the Jet Clean system is a joke and can only be understood fully by users of the Braun system.  I do like the shaver though and got it for a good price on Amazon so I just put the Jet Cleaner in storage (maybe it should go in the trash :)) and I rinse the shaver under water to clean it which works very well.</li>
    <li> I got this for Christmas 2005 and love it. I&#x27;ve used Norelcos since the early 1980&#x27;s and this is the best I&#x27;ve had yet.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The shave is fast and close. If you want a smoothe-feeling shave AS your shaving, this may not be for you. It has a \\&quot;rougher\\&quot; feeling on my skin than my 8825xl as I am shaving, but it cuts faster and closer. The 8825xl glides smoothly over my skin -very easily, but the shaving time takes forever. This 9170xl glides, but you know its there. It doesn&#x27;t take your skin off or anything like that, but you know your using a shaver when its in use. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Battery time between shaving seems to last forever. I charged it 2x in the last month + I&#x27;ve had it, but it didn&#x27;t need the charge.. Electronic readout looks neat, but I only care about the shave. The travel pouch is nice and small, it just covers up the razor for travel- very efficient. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I only have the shaver and not the dock with cleaning solution. I&#x27;ll rinse it out in hot water every couple of days to keep it clean.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this shaver to anyone considering it. You&#x27;ll be very happy with your purchase every time you use it. Well worth a try.</li>
    <li> After receiving one of these in full kit form for an early birthday present, several months ago, I went out and bought a $48.00 Norelco 6613X model rechargable and want to unload this other overpriced, overrated and cheesy upper-end model. I&#x27;d rather put that kind of money toward some computer or camera gear than use this 9170 XLCC with clean system. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My primary razor is an older Costco Norelco model that was about $70. and is of the 8000- series. It still works after 6 years. The heads on the new 6613X are identical and so I have a spare set of cutters, if need be, for about $10. more than just the heads sell for here. That&#x27;s a cheap way to get a spare battery, too. So, I&#x27;m set for another 6 years, plus parts between these lower models. Since most shaver shops want more than these are worth to repair or replace parts anymore, they are all disposable. It&#x27;s Criminal. So why pay alot for semi-toxic recyclables -- and you can&#x27;t even change the battery out yourself. They won&#x27;t sell you the parts, either. $$$ junk!! Plus they say the heads only last one year. Why?</li>
    <li> Have been using for 2 months. Real quiet. Gives me the closest shave yet. Yes the price is high but I gave it 4 stars for results.</li>
    <li> Great product if it didn&#x27;t have a pop-up trimmer. I&#x27;ve been using Norelco&#x27;s with great satisfaction for 15+ years. The floating head on this unit would be great, but the minute you float it to your face, the popup trimmer pops undesireably. Impossible to just get a shave without that darn thing popping up on you. They just designed it very poorly in that the popup trimmer is attached to the floating head, while the retaining clip to hold the trimmer in place doesn&#x27;t float. Obvious design flaw. I&#x27;m sending the product back.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband for Christmas.  When he was looking at the various models he said that he was unsure about whether the inner wheels of the 3 heads would rotate at a different speed and pull (ie hurt).  So far he has been very impressed with the results - he does not impress easily.  We have decided that the results he gets with this shaver are so good that he will not be using the disposable razors anymore.  The shave he gets is smooth and clean.  We are both happy.  Great product.  He also likes the self cleaning part; it is very easy.  Maintenance is easy too.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco razors for over 50 years, and this is is the best yet.  It&#x27;s a close smooth shave and the cleaning system works really well.</li>
    <li> The Good    9170XLCC gives an excellent shave in about 5 minutes.  It&#x27;ll take about 2 weeks of daily use for your beard to adjust to the razor heads, but after that it&#x27;s as close and clean as any blade shave.    The Bad:    1. It&#x27;s cheaply made.  Norelco has outsourced manufacturing &amp; it shows.  The frame holding the razor heads is plastic; every other Norelco I&#x27;ve owned (over 30 years) has been metal.  The frame is supported by these weird plastic-bubble \\&quot;shock absorbers\\&quot; that will probably go in a year or two.  The shaver has a junky, cheap feel to it.  I have always gotten 5-6 years of use out of my past Norelcos; this one feels like it&#x27;ll last about two years.    2. Cleaning tank is a marketing gimmick to sell $[...]/bottle cleaning solution.  Way overkill.  It does work OK, but the shaver gets just as clean if you rinse it under hot tap water (which you will have to do anyway because the cleaning solution leaves the razor heads coated with a slimy residue).  You can pretty much throw it out after the free bottle of solution is used up.    3. I&#x27;m already on my second unit.  The chip that controls the battery level indicator, recharging, etc. is flakey.  The first one I had never could accurately display battery level even after 3 complete charge-discharge-recharge cycles.  It&#x27;d show 15-20 minutes remaining, then just die in the middle of the shave; battery tapped out.  Also, it would sometimes illuminate for no reason at all; had to turn on-off to clear it.  If it happened during the night, the battery would be fully discharged by morning.  So I returned it to Amazon.com (thx Amazon for great customer service!!!).    The second one that they sent to me recharges continuously when you use it with the cleaning tank -- it&#x27;s not supposed to charge during the 55-minute cleaning cycle, but mine does.  That means that you have to catch it about 5 minutes into the cycle, after it&#x27;s done it&#x27;s dunking in the tank, or it&#x27;ll recharge completely after every shave (which theinstructions tell you not to do because it shortens battery life).  More reason to toss the cleaning unit.  Ridiculous on a shaver this expensive that they&#x27;d ship junk to their customers before fixing these problems.    4. The travel case is worthless for protecting the shaver on the road.  It&#x27;s nothing but a zippered nylon sack.  You&#x27;ll have to put the shaver into something else if you pack it in checked luggage or it&#x27;ll be a pile of parts when you unpack.    5. They don&#x27;t include a stand so when you&#x27;re done shaving you lay it on the bathroom countertop.  I&#x27;m using the one from my old Norelco, but if you don&#x27;t have one, storage between shaves is just setting it down somewhere.    Sad to see a fine old company like Norelco cheapening it&#x27;s flagship product like this.  I&#x27;ve been a customer for 30+ years, but next time I&#x27;m in the market for a shaver I will definitely comparison-shop the competition.    Two stars because it does give a good shave; the rest is a mess.</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly, complete and well packaged. In a nutshell; this razor is everything it says it is. I use it daily on my beard AND my head.</li>
    <li> I had fooled around with Braun based on recommendations of others and because of its self-cleaning feature. When Norelco came out with a self-cleaner, I jumped back because of a closer and much quieter shave.  The Norelco 9170XLCC is the best I&#x27;ve ever owned and that goes back to my first Norelco in 1955 and includes a lots of Norelcos and others since.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor and have been very happy with the way it works.  It has a long battery life and the Jet Cleaning works extremely well.  It has exceeded my expectatioins.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only negatives are: &lt;br /&gt;1) The charging base is a little large and bulky, and the power cord makes it even more awkward. &lt;br /&gt;2)  It is expensive but it is a top of the line product.</li>
    <li> Norelco, these things last!  I&#x27;m over 50 years old, with my first Norelco, I never replaced anything and it kept me groomed for years. Only after a decade or so did the on/off switch fail. Then I went to cordless that lasted for more than a decade and never replaced any part in it either, then it just stopped working. Now I have the Smart Touch-XL and just when you think things could not get better, it does. The floating heads shave closer and faster than my previous shavers and then I put in the stand and it cleans itself. Whata a system! What&#x27;s even better is it was so simple to find on-line and to order. Norelco should build cars.  I&#x27;d would buy a Norelco one.</li>
    <li> I needed to replace my old Norelco so I purchased the 9170xlcc.  I was tired of manually cleaning my razor so I wanted to try the new jet clean system this time.  This razor looks and feels great and I like the sensitive skin dial that adjusts the amount the razor flexes on your face.  I feel the blades on the XL shavers do turn slower so I don&#x27;t save time by shaving with it and it actually takes longer and more going over the same area than with my old Norelco.  The biggest thing I didn&#x27;t like is the Jet Clean system you see pictured with the razor is black and that is what I wanted and thought I was ordering. When it arrived it was white. I called Norelco and Amazon and both places gave me the brush off. Amazon told me to call Norelco and Norelco told me to call amazon, you know how that goes. I will give the razor 3 stars and customer service from Amazon and Norelco 0 stars.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pricey razor yet it keeps coming apart!  The hinge used to hold on the head is made out of really bad metal that twists and rusts and the head comes off very easily as a result.  I wouldn&#x27;t trust Norelco ever sice the merge with Phillips.  To add insult to injury, the head fell on the floor by accident and it shattered to pieces.  I busted out my Gilette fusion and got a much better shave in seconds flat with none of the hassle.  Goodbye Norelco and goodbye electric razors.</li>
    <li> I had a ten year old norelco advantage razor which is essentially the same configuration but just one cutting ring on each of the 3 heads as opposed to the three that come with this one.  I got a better and more comfortable shave with my older norelco than with this one.  This shaver still works well and if you&#x27;re switching from something else these are the way to go but I&#x27;d buy an older, less expensive model as this one is not better than my older version.  The cleaning system is a gimmicky waste as all you need to do is open the head and rinse it out for 3 seconds (unless you consider that too much work).  End result, find the cheapest norelco razor you can and you&#x27;ll be just as happy.</li>
    <li> I bought the 9170XLCC and I found that the shave was very superior to my old Norelco from 5 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However the cleaning system seems to be buggy.  I had to return the first one I got because after 2 minutes it would just blink forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just got my replacement and while the shaver is still great, I am having the same problem.  This time I let the lights blink and eventually after about 45 minutes it said it was done.  This is far more than 2 minutes.</li>
    <li> I received the Norelco 9170XL electric shaving system for Christmas. I am 100% impressed with the quality of the new and improved three row blade shaving system. One great feature is the digital read out on the front of the razor. It provides all the information you will need. It even tells you when it needs cleaning, charging and time used for each shave.  &lt;br /&gt;At first, I thought I would never use the cleaning system, but since I had it I would at least try it. The cleaning system works very good and conditions the razor. It also recharges the razor if you leave the system on, with the lever down. Now I have been using the cleaning system every couple of days, because I like the way it conditions the blades. &lt;br /&gt;I have used several Norelco electric razors for the last 30 years and have always been satisfied with the razors. However, the Norelco 9170XL is so much more superior it&#x27;s hard to compare. This electric razor gives me a much closer shave, cleaner, faster shave then any of my older electric razors. I highly recommend this electric shaving system. I gave it a five star rating. I do feel that you will be satisfied too.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Norelco 9170 for the following reasons: &lt;br /&gt;1.  Three rows of cutting blades to shave faster &lt;br /&gt;2.  90 minutes of shave time per charge &lt;br /&gt;3.  A timer that shows how much time is actually remaining versus other models that just tell you the battery is getting low. &lt;br /&gt;4.  Easy to clean. &lt;br /&gt;In reality, it does not shave faster than my old Norelco, nor does it shave closer than the old one.  The 90 minutes of shave time? The first time I charged it up before the first use, it charged to 85 minutes.  The second charge went to 80. I&#x27;m now on the third charge and it&#x27;s down to 78 minutes. I also noticed that as the battery runs down under 20 minutes of shave time, 10 minutes mysteriously drop off so in reality you get less time than what the full charge shows. &lt;br /&gt;It is, however, easy to clean and more quiet than my Quadra. That&#x27;s the only advantage. I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money on this model and had purchased a less expensive model. The jet clean system just wastes space in my bathroom. &lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m rather disappointed at the product I got, especially for the price paid. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do in providing a quick, close shave.  I especially like how quiet it is.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver based on my test of a much less costly Norelco rotary shaver. I used a Panasonic, my third, and the trimmer blade came loose. Panasonic service was nonexistent so I decided to switch to the rotary after testing a razor my son no longer needed. That gave a great shave but did not have a trimmer. The only trimmer unit was this expensive SmartTouch XL. This, by the way, is not a wet and dry shaver. Knowing this, I decided to give it a try anyway. For the price, I guessed it gave a really good shave.  Not! I have to work really hard to get the little nubs. Sometimes a trimmer helps to get the persistent hairs but the trimmer is a flip up item that does not lock in. It can only be used when applying pressure to the hinge or it flips shut. The trimmer also does not get close to the hair base, only trimming longer hairs. Forget any ear hairs with this trimmer.    In summary, this was engineered by a technician who must have a full untrimmed beard. If you want a rotary razor, get the cheaper ones or try another brand. I would return this but I waited too long hoping for the super shave that comes with time. After almost nine months, I am about to give up on that hope.</li>
