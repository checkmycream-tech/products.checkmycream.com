      <li>I am sure it&#x27;s a good product for some.</li>

      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell great but the results for me have been worth it.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>

      <li>It seems to be working in treating that, so I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
      <li>I love this product and have used it about 5 years or so.  </li>
      <li>Great, gentle cleanser.</li>
      <li>I bought this after reading great reviews on Amazon and it really does work for me.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Delivered fast and great product for acne</li>
      <li>I will be buying more though.</li>
      <li>For the price point there are much better alternatives.</li>
      <li>It also made my face more oily than it already is.</li>
      <li>It does make my oily skin drier and more taut (</li>
      <li>then she responded innocently, &amp;#34;because</li>
      <li>Per my dermatologist&#x27;s suggestion, I use RetinA and Azalex on the weekends so that my skin will respond to the products better.  </li>
      <li>We stopped using it as it was too strong.</li>
      <li>The odor is not overly strong, and goes away after a bit</li>
      <li>I have hormonal cystic acne at times, which it cannot prevent, but seems to heal them more quickly.</li>
      <li>and I think I&#x27;m going to like it, reasonable price point and effective</li>
      <li>I started using this with reg aveeno moisturizer in the mornings and have now been zit/oil free for 3 months.</li>
      <li>The product is great for oily skin with big pores!</li>
      <li>I smiled and said thanks,  </li>
      <li>My makeup goes on smooth.  </li>
      <li>This stuff works great, apply it at morning, night, middle of the day, it will do the job and absorbs into the skin as if not even there.</li>
      <li>CosMedix has been amazing for me when nothing else really worked-</li>
      <li>Great, I&#x27;ve bought this from my dermatologist and this is the same product.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to try this product as it seemed to promise a lot based on the reviews I&#x27;ve seen on here and on the Cosmedix site.</li>
      <li>but make sure to read the ingredients first and to know your skin.</li>
      <li>so this product was a complete splurge for me to purchase, but I had read such wonderful things about it online that I had to give it a try.</li>
      <li>and i know its suppposed to be bright yellow.</li>
      <li>Even on those days when a blemish stubbornly breaks through, this serum has quickly cleared it up.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with the results from constant use--morning and night.</li>
      <li>Also, more importantly, results on par with the expectation of the higher-end of facial care products.</li>
      <li>and is definitely worth the price.</li>
      <li>The Phytoclear is a little sappy and sticky almost like tree sapp, with a nice fresh strong sent.</li>
      <li>The scent of the product was also pretty unbearable at first, but I quickly got used to it.</li>
      <li>However, be sure to use sunscreen after putting it on, as it may make some skin areas a bit red.  </li>
      <li>Each day my red marks from many years of acne are fading.</li>
      <li>This is my first time using this brand</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t magic and it took patience and constantly but eventually my face cleared up.  </li>
      <li>I was really excited to try this serum due to the fact that I suffer with adult acne and based on other reviews, this product worked great!</li>
      <li>The problems are the smell is overwhelming and it left his face very irritated and dry/flakey.</li>
      <li>couldn&#x27;t stand the smell of it long enough to even hug me good night.</li>
      <li>I searched for weeks for a solution that would be most likely to help- trying many products and suggestions that did little to nothing for me, so after about three months, I decided to give CosMedix a try.</li>
      <li>Anyway this is the real deal</li>
      <li>It really did nothing for me.</li>
      <li>My skin gets VERY irritated in response to tea tree oil.</li>
      <li>I used it for two weeks straight.</li>
      <li>I use along with the gentle cleanser and the exfoliating cleanser.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m actually starting to enjoy looking in the mirror where as before I&#x27;d avoid it at all costs.</li>
      <li>I have never been confident about my face due to my acne</li>
      <li>I am glad to say that while I still have the red marks from the blemishes, I haven&#x27;t had a major flare up of cystic acne since.</li>
      <li>It significantly reduces my acne, and even when I do get a pimple, they are smaller.</li>
      <li>I wear very little makeup because this keeps my skin looking nice.</li>
      <li>have oily/acne prone skin that is pretty sensitive</li>
      <li>I have dry, hormonal acne-prone skin, and have had a tough time finding a good product to clear up the lovely blemishes I get around the jawline.  </li>
      <li>which sucks because its supposed to be such a great thing for problem skin.</li>
      <li>I had problems with break outs, particularly when I travel.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend, even if it is pricey.</li>
      <li>I have tried everything in the market from high end products to drugstore ones and nothing seemed to work.</li>
      <li>Appears to be high quality</li>
      <li>Perhaps its sensitive to certain skin types.</li>
      <li>I used it pretty regularly and clean my face often, but I&#x27;ll still get an occasional breakout.</li>
      <li>In addition to the rash, the serum has a very medicinal smell and my 7 year old</li>
      <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because I am waiting on the (still relatively fresh) scars from the outbreak in January to fade, which this serum says it will do.</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t until last night when I was going through pictures that I really realized how much!</li>
      <li>In my teen years, I rarely had a blemish.</li>
      <li>Also, I have a few more blackheads than normal, but after my battle with the cystic acne-</li>
      <li>This definitely wasn&#x27;t worth the price for me.</li>
      <li>Buy a good facial wash, use the tried and true salicylic acid and beonzozyl peroxide, and use some sort of dark spot corrector (like NuJu Dark Spot Corrector Cream) and call it a day, but skip this one.</li>
      <li>This past January, at the age of 22, I experienced sudden and severe cystic acne on both my cheeks and chin, leaving me in pain and with low self-esteem.</li>
      <li>/&gt;UPDATE: After finishing this product, I did not see consistent enough results to continue purchasing at the relatively high price.</li>
      <li>;  I decided to try something new.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> weak, and result is not as expected.</li>
    <li> Phytoclear works great as a spot treatment and I have even put it on ingrown hairs, yes it works. Reduces inflamation (swelling), redness on the skin surface and even caused my skin to recover quicker from a breakout with the use of Cosmedix clarity. Both are good products to use together. The Phytoclear is a little sappy and sticky almost like tree sapp, with a nice fresh strong sent. This stuff works great, apply it at morning, night, middle of the day, it will do the job and absorbs into the skin as if not even there. A little goes a long ways for spot treatment, but if you plan on applying to the entire face, I&#x27;m not sure if a bottle will last a 1-2 months, your guess is as good as mine. I will be buying more though.</li>
    <li> Unfortunetelly it doesnt do anything to my skin :(</li>
    <li> this product made my skin very dry but made me look like a had a bad tan on my face.</li>
    <li> I love this product and have used it about 5 years or so.  It is yellow so you must rub it in.  I think it has Sacylic acid in it, so it is not good for very dry skin.  I wear it every day and alternate with Refine at night.  I am 52 and have combination skin.  I wear very little makeup because this keeps my skin looking nice.</li>
    <li> Smells bad and did not work for my acne.</li>
    <li> Great, I&#x27;ve bought this from my dermatologist and this is the same product. Works great at calming acne. Love it!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Along with the recommended products, it helps make my skin feel younger and healthier. The only thing I dislike about this product is the scent, however.</li>
    <li> I had problems with break outs, particularly when I travel.  I use this product to keep skin clear everyday, but particularly when I travel.  It&#x27;s great when there is a breakout at clearing things up quickly.</li>
    <li> I am a college student so this product was a complete splurge for me to purchase, but I had read such wonderful things about it online that I had to give it a try. I have oily and acne- prone skin so I was really hoping this product would at least semi help to combat these two things. I only used it for about three days and my skin began to break out all over. It also made my face more oily than it already is. I&#x27;m not sure why people like this so much and I am really upset that I spent so much money on a product that is a complete disappointment. Now it sits unused on my counter probably to be thrown in the trash.</li>
    <li> Another one of those shams. It&#x27;s sad how many products out there claim to do anything for your acne but do just about nothing, if not make it worse. Save your money. Buy a good facial wash, use the tried and true salicylic acid and beonzozyl peroxide, and use some sort of dark spot corrector (like NuJu Dark Spot Corrector Cream) and call it a day, but skip this one. I gave it two stars (instead of one) because at least the reviews I read online made it worth the try. Fyi I am black..so different skin tones may react differently.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now, in the mornings. It takes a sort of kitchen sink approach, throwing in everything from witch hazel &amp; alcohol to retinol to tea tree oil to salicylic acid to a bunch of essential oils. It does make my oily skin drier and more taut (firm?) but so far hasn&#x27;t seemed to reduce my blemishes any. Be forewarned that it DOES have a VERY strong scent of tea tree oil if that bothers you.</li>
    <li> I have dry, hormonal acne-prone skin, and have had a tough time finding a good product to clear up the lovely blemishes I get around the jawline.  So far this serum has helped quite a bit, but I must apply over moisturizer and cannot apply too close to the upper lip area or it irritates.  For the price and the results so far I will repurchase.</li>
    <li> Worked a bit for my son. The problems are the smell is overwhelming and it left his face very irritated and dry/flakey. We stopped using it as it was too strong.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t mean for this review to scare anyone away. I am sure it&#x27;s a good product for some. but make sure to read the ingredients first and to know your skin. My skin gets VERY irritated in response to tea tree oil. which sucks because its supposed to be such a great thing for problem skin. but I get a horrible inflamed rash from it so this product was a nightmare for me.</li>
    <li> Its made very little difference after 2 weeks of use. Perhaps its sensitive to certain skin types. Didnt work for me at all</li>
    <li> I have been using CosMedix Clarity Serum for almost 5 months now.  September 2014 I started breaking out along my jaw line and face with painful cystic acne.  I always had good skin but at 33 I started breaking out and did everything to get rid of it.  December 2014 my daughter (8 years old) told me one morning that I looked like a teenager.  I smiled and said thanks,  then she responded innocently, &amp;#34;because you have zits on your face. &amp;#34;  I decided to try something new.  Obviously something in my body was changing and it was starting to hurt to wash my face.  I started a sugar detox,  drank half my body weight in water and used this serum twice a day, lightly in the morning (under my makeup) and heavier at night.  I could tell the next day it was starting to work.  It wasn&#x27;t magic and it took patience and constantly but eventually my face cleared up.  It wasn&#x27;t until last night when I was going through pictures that I really realized how much! I have not had a single painful zit in months.  My face no longer hurts.  My makeup goes on smooth.  I&#x27;m not embarrassed to go for a walk without makeup on.  Occasionally a little zit will pop up so i just apply the serum a bit heavier at night and wake up clear.  I do think a healthier diet and plenty on water helps, no doubt about that.  I will never go to bed with makeup again, I am left with the scars from the 4-5 months of painful cystic acne and they remind me to never take my skin for granted again and I will continue to purchase CosMedix Clarity Serum and apply twice a day.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s working? I don&#x27;t know. I used it pretty regularly and clean my face often, but I&#x27;ll still get an occasional breakout.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try this serum due to the fact that I suffer with adult acne and based on other reviews, this product worked great! However my excitement was quickly depleted due to experiencing  a serious rash after beginning the use of this product. In addition to the rash, the serum has a very medicinal smell and my 7 year old couldn&#x27;t stand the smell of it long enough to even hug me good night.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is the best acne serum.</li>
    <li> I have never written a review before but had to for this product because I never want this company to go out of business. I have had bad acne around my mouth and chin for years and tried everything from prescription creams to proactive. This is the only thing that has ever worked. It significantly reduces my acne, and even when I do get a pimple, they are smaller. I now buy two of these at a time because I would be miserable if I ran out.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work. Broken pump.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with how fast the item came... although I am not not super sure if it makes a major difference in my skin. I do not know if I would repurchase the product, but I was definitely happy with how fast it arrived for me to try it!</li>
    <li> I never saw the improvement in my acne that I was looking for. Now I know that I needed a prescription-strength retinol product. Especially if you&#x27;ve used an over the counter retinol product that didn&#x27;t work for you, I suggest going to the doc instead of just trying another one. This definitely wasn&#x27;t worth the price for me. That being said, I saw no adverse effects or increase in acne either.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading great reviews on Amazon and it really does work for me. I put it on at night and my skin looks great in the morning.  So far since I&#x27;ve been using this product I&#x27;ve had no major breakouts and very few minor ones. It doesn&#x27;t smell great but the results for me have been worth it.&lt;br /&gt;One note, make sure you use a good moisturizer after you use this.  It will dry your skin a bit.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year, along with Refine.  I&#x27;m 39 and I have the skin of a teenage...unfortunately.  It keep my acne at bay, and my makeup goes over this product with ease.  Per my dermatologist&#x27;s suggestion, I use RetinA and Azalex on the weekends so that my skin will respond to the products better.  I highly recommend, even if it is pricey.</li>
    <li> This product does not work for my cystic acne or acne scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been struggling with hormonal acne and typical breakouts for the past two-ish years. I was so excited to try this product as it seemed to promise a lot based on the reviews I&#x27;ve seen on here and on the Cosmedix site. It really did nothing for me. My acne scars stayed quite prominent and I continue to get pretty awful breakouts. I&#x27;ve been using the serum every day and night for three weeks--they said to expect results in two--and nothing has improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just disappointed that I spent so much on such a small of amount of useless serum.</li>
    <li> This product came and it was a dark yellow/orange color so I&#x27;m guessing it was really old. It still smelled the same, but I&#x27;ve been using this product for 10yrs and i know its suppposed to be bright yellow. the only reason I but it online now is bc no salon near me sells it anymore. I&#x27;m disappointed I paid $70 for this and face wash and it&#x27;s the face wash also seems really old. Guess ill be switching face wash regimens. It&#x27;s a shame bc this really is an amazing product for acne or oily skin.</li>
    <li> While this might have worked for some, it didn&#x27;t work for me. I used it for two weeks straight. It made my skin grease and didn&#x27;t clear up any pimples.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days but already notice a big difference. This is my first time using this brand and I think I&#x27;m going to like it, reasonable price point and effective</li>
    <li> This product works great on my combination skin, helps keep the irritated redness under control. I need to order some more!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years.  Its great to put on if you see a blemish coming on.  Blends into skin well, too.  However, be sure to use sunscreen after putting it on, as it may make some skin areas a bit red.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> I had severe cystic acne and oily skin. I tried everything (even Accutane). I started using this with reg aveeno moisturizer in the mornings and have now been zit/oil free for 3 months. Some people complained of the smell in the reviews but I like it, kinda eucalyptus-smelling. Anyway this is the real deal and I thought I would never get rid of the zits that have plagued me for more than 20 yrs, for the first time I have confidence and love my beautiful skin. I hope the manufacturer reads this and knows they made a difference in someone&#x27;s life, it&#x27;s that awesome.</li>
    <li> This product seems to help even out the skin, but you&#x27;ll need to go through several bottles of it, to see great results, but otherwise my only complaint is that it smells bad and because you do rub it on your face, it should smell good or have no scent at all.</li>
    <li> I am a 30 year old woman who has been suffering from acne since I was 11. Now in my 30&#x27;s it seemed to have gotten much worse dealing with Cystic hormonal acne (the worst). I have tried everything in the market from high end products to drugstore ones and nothing seemed to work. I was skeptical about trying this but I can tell you...IT&#x27;S MY HOLY GRAIL. Within a matter of a week I started to see a biiig difference. It started to dry and clear all the cystic acne around my jawline. I have never been confident about my face due to my acne but if anyone out there that is dealing with this, please give this product a try. I promise that if it helped me, it will help you!</li>
    <li> This serum works well at healing blemishes. I have hormonal cystic acne at times, which it cannot prevent, but seems to heal them more quickly. Mattifies, soothes, does not dry out skin. I apply moisturizer over it on dry areas, &amp; Clarity stays in place.</li>
    <li> Appears to be high quality</li>
    <li> Great, gentle cleanser. I used to have acne around my chin and forehead, but with daily use of this and the clarity serum I have awesomely clear skin!</li>
    <li> Did nothing. Waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> I bought this to treat the cystic acne I have that is caused by PCOS. It seems to be working in treating that, so I&#x27;m pleased with it. The only note of caution I have is that the scent, which is a little unpleasant, is very strong. If you&#x27;re sensitive to scent, this may not be for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After finishing this product, I did not see consistent enough results to continue purchasing at the relatively high price. Have moved on and will continue looking for a good retinol treatment.</li>
    <li> I do not like the smell at all.  I cannot comment on the effectiveness of the product since I don&#x27;t want to use it.  The odor is not overly strong, and goes away after a bit but it is something that I just chose to toss out because why smell something bad if you don&#x27;t have to.</li>
    <li> The product is great for oily skin with big pores! The skin becomes matt, the pores become smaller. If you do in the addition facial cleaning - then one should expect the decrease of acne. The smell is not so good, but I can handl it.</li>
    <li> I had high optimism that this would be the product to finally clear up some annoying pockets of blemishes and marks on my skin. For the price point I expected quality and results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The truth:&lt;br /&gt;Overpriced. Ineffective. All the focus of CosMedix was apparently on making the packaging and label look very higher-end face clarity serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;Might work for others. Waste of space for me. For the price point there are much better alternatives. Also, more importantly, results on par with the expectation of the higher-end of facial care products. CosMedix is not one of them.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews.... But this product is amazing! I&#x27;ve used every product there is for my adult acne. This is the only thing that has ever worked!! I have smooth skin now which I&#x27;ve never been able to say! Each day my red marks from many years of acne are fading. My skin is less oily. I&#x27;m actually starting to enjoy looking in the mirror where as before I&#x27;d avoid it at all costs. I would recommend this to any female in her 30&#x27;s with acne... It&#x27;s not another failed promise. It works!!!!</li>
    <li> I have tried nearly every prescription, every herbal remedy and every treatment for acne and nothing has ever come close to this face-saving, skin-replenishing serum. I could not be happier. Even on those days when a blemish stubbornly breaks through, this serum has quickly cleared it up. This is-by far-one of my favorite finds.</li>
    <li> Delivered fast and great product for acne</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m over 40, prone to acne and this product works wonders for my complexion.  I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> In my teen years, I rarely had a blemish. This past January, at the age of 22, I experienced sudden and severe cystic acne on both my cheeks and chin, leaving me in pain and with low self-esteem. I searched for weeks for a solution that would be most likely to help- trying many products and suggestions that did little to nothing for me, so after about three months, I decided to give CosMedix a try. I hoped that for the steep price, it would be of good quality. I ordered both the Clarity serum and the Purity cleanser. After just a few days of using both products morning and night, I saw a marked reduction in the redness and inflammation. I kept using both products faithfully and have been for nearly a month by this point. I am glad to say that while I still have the red marks from the blemishes, I haven&#x27;t had a major flare up of cystic acne since. About once a week or so, I have gotten a small bump or two, but they haven&#x27;t been nearly as large, inflamed, or painful- and they go away in just a couple days of appearing because of my continued use of the products! CosMedix has been amazing for me when nothing else really worked- and is definitely worth the price. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because I am waiting on the (still relatively fresh) scars from the outbreak in January to fade, which this serum says it will do. Also, I have a few more blackheads than normal, but after my battle with the cystic acne- I&#x27;m not too concerned with that at this point. The scent of the product was also pretty unbearable at first, but I quickly got used to it. I am being patient with this product, and hope this review can help someone else struggling with cystic acne that only seems to worsen.</li>
    <li> This prouduct has changed my life. It has cleared and even out my skin tone and only around my period do I experience any breakouts. I use along with the gentle cleanser and the exfoliating cleanser. So happy to have found this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oily/acne prone skin that is pretty sensitive</li>
    <li> My facial its recommended this product for my hormone-induced blemishes along my jawline. It works. I&#x27;m very pleased with the results from constant use--morning and night. I no longer have crazy break-outs!</li>
