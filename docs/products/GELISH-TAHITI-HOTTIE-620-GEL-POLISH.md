    <li> Great bright summer color!  This goes on nicely and does not wrinkle.  It takes 3 layers instead of 2 to get the nice bold color.  The picture is maybe a bit darker than it looks on my nails.  It is a very pretty color.  Also a great one for a bold look on the toes.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t quite the purple I&#x27;d hoped it was. More like a hot pink. Good quality polish.</li>

    <li> lovely purple/fuchsia color, great for summer! More purple than fuchsia, if you ask me...reminds me of the color of Barney the dinosaur from children&#x27;s TV :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No sparkle/shimmer, just a shiny finish.  Easy to apply.</li>
    <li> The colour was not what I was expecting.  From the picture it looked like a darker fuchsia, but it actually bright purple.</li>
