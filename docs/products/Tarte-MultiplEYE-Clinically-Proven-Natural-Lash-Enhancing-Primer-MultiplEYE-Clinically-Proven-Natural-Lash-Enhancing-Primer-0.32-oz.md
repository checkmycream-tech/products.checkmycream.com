### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>/&gt;it is so wonderful!!!</li>
      <li>Maybe pain lol!</li>
      <li>Best of all I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>Great prep for eye shadow.</li>
      <li>I wear it almost every time I apply mascara work great thickens lengths and make my mascara stay put .</li>
      <li>Love this works perfect.</li>
      <li>It works with drugstore mascaras on top of it too!  </li>
      <li>I am in love with this primer!  </li>
      <li>I love tarte!</li>
      <li>I get many compliments on my lashes.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This doesn&#x27;t add the buxom volume some primers do, but it is ok for day wear when I don&#x27;t want my lashes to look over the top.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I love this product because it adds length</li>
      <li>I would recommend this as day-primer, when you don&#x27;t need huge lashes-but want to keep them from flaking out.</li>
      <li>I cannot say enough about this product, it is so great.  </li>
      <li>So, I decided to purchase the original version of it.</li>
      <li>, I can only imagine the difference it would make with a good quality mascara</li>
      <li>This is an absolute must have!  </li>
      <li>Tarte plays the line between &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;prestige&amp;#34; in cosmetics; this is the first product of theirs I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>When firstly I recieved the trial version of this product and tried it on my lashes the results were awsome.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Although this didn&#x27;t add the volume I was hopping for, nor did it stop clumping-it did have some positive qualities.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for people like me who have pretty thin lashes.  </li>
      <li>No clumps - just gorgeous long lashes that last all day and all night.</li>
      <li>The mascara really grips to the lash primer and helps out.  </li>
      <li>This product REALLY irritated my eyes, so I threw it away.</li>
      <li>I really like this mascara primer.</li>
      <li>The next evening, I used my normal primer (Oscillation-Lancome) and compared this to the Tarte Primer under my mascara-there was a huge difference and my mascara looked very lopsided for the night.</li>
      <li>However, it has been a decent compliment to a natural mascara.</li>
      <li>This actually works, it enhances the look of my lashes and it makes my cheap drugstore mascara last longer and without smudges.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really like this product except that it seems to dry up really quickly &amp; the brush is not the friendliest to use once the product starts to get dry.</li>
      <li>In comparison to drugstore primers, it falls short; it creates clumpy, spidery spikes when applied thickly and doesnt seem to do too much when applied lightly.</li>
      <li>My lashes didn&#x27;t flake out the way they would have if I had just worn mascara on bare lashes.</li>
      <li>I would not pay nearly $30 bucks again, though, when a second coat of mascara does the same job.</li>

<li> Combine this with NYX mascara and you will have lashes UNLIKE ANY OTHER.</li>
<li> My lashes looks naturally long and thick (they are not without it) with this product.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used it with different mascaras like covergirl to benefits bad girl mascaras and the results are always terrific.</li>
<li> It also seems to help mascara stay put and not have the &amp;#34;raccoon&amp;#34; eyes that I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>

<li> I have thin, wimpy lashes and this primer elongates and makes my lashes look thicker.</li>
<li> Useless.  </li>
<li> Provides crazy length and volume.  </li>

    <li> I am in love with this primer!  I&#x27;d never used a lash primer before, and let me tell you, this primer makes a world of difference!  It works with drugstore mascaras on top of it too!  Provides crazy length and volume.  This is an absolute must have!  Please try it!</li>
    <li> Great prep for eye shadow. Best of all I&#x27;ve tried.</li>

    <li> Combine this with NYX mascara and you will have lashes UNLIKE ANY OTHER. No clumps - just gorgeous long lashes that last all day and all night. I&#x27;ve never found anything like it - but the combo is key.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for people like me who have pretty thin lashes.  The mascara really grips to the lash primer and helps out.  Using 2 coats of mascara doesn&#x27;t do the same for me and oftentimes gets clumpy looking.  So yes, it&#x27;s a little on the pricey side, but the bottle lasts me quite a long time!</li>
    <li> Love this works perfect. Makes lashes thicker and longer</li>
    <li> Tarte plays the line between &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;prestige&amp;#34; in cosmetics; this is the first product of theirs I&#x27;ve tried. In comparison to drugstore primers, it falls short; it creates clumpy, spidery spikes when applied thickly and doesnt seem to do too much when applied lightly. However, it has been a decent compliment to a natural mascara.I would not pay nearly $30 bucks again, though, when a second coat of mascara does the same job.</li>
    <li> I ALWAYS wear lash primer when I wear mascara for a number reasons. It keeps lashes from flaking out, adds volumes, holds mascara in place and keeps raccoon eyes from forming. Over the years I have used a number of lash primers over the years, but this is only the second \\&quot;natural\\&quot; lash primer I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tarte claims this product adds 739% volume to lashes-this is a gross exaggeration in my opinion. I have used this with both a Tarte mascara (which I was very unimpressed with), and my stand-by mascara and noticed almost no difference in volume, and very little difference in clumping.  The next evening, I used my normal primer (Oscillation-Lancome) and compared this to the Tarte Primer under my mascara-there was a huge difference and my mascara looked very lopsided for the night. My Lancome primer won out for the night, but I hung onto my Tarte for the next day at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this didn&#x27;t add the volume I was hopping for, nor did it stop clumping-it did have some positive qualities. My lashes didn&#x27;t flake out the way they would have if I had just worn mascara on bare lashes. My mascara held on throughout the day, and it didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t add the buxom volume some primers do, but it is ok for day wear when I don&#x27;t want my lashes to look over the top. I would recommend this as day-primer, when you don&#x27;t need huge lashes-but want to keep them from flaking out.</li>
    <li> Useless.  Didn&#x27;t  work</li>
    <li> This actually works, it enhances the look of my lashes and it makes my cheap drugstore mascara last longer and without smudges.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I can only imagine the difference it would make with a good quality mascara</li>
    <li> It really does increase the volume of my lashes; I use it everyday (along with my Tarte mazonian Clay Mascara)and I love it.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it adds length and you don&#x27;t have to worry about poisonous chemicals getting into your eyes! I love tarte! Beauty should not be poison ! Maybe pain lol! But not poision !</li>
    <li> I really like this mascara primer. I have thin, wimpy lashes and this primer elongates and makes my lashes look thicker. It also seems to help mascara stay put and not have the &amp;#34;raccoon&amp;#34; eyes that I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
    <li> goes on white but the color dissapears after a few minutes. looks conditioned and separates lashes</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough about this product, it is so great.  Makes putting on mascara an ease. Buy this product&lt;br /&gt;it is so wonderful!!!</li>
