      <li>one is great!  </li>

      <li>I don&#x27;t think it would be good for oily skin however.</li>
      <li>Good for the beach though.</li>

      <li>This is a wonderful facial moisturizer, and I especially love that it has SPF 40 in it to protect against UVA and UVB rays.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite day time moisturizer!  </li>
      <li>All in all, I will be ordering this again for sure!</li>
      <li>excellent-we love it!</li>
      <li>This one was highly rated and I&#x27;m very happy with it.  </li>
      <li>It is the perfect amount of moisture - my skin doesn&#x27;t get oily but still feels soft all day.  </li>
      <li>It offers great protection and makes my face look good.  </li>
      <li>Loved the quick service, I did not expect to get it so soon.  </li>
      <li>I am glad I bought this and will probably buy it again as soon as I run out.</li>
      <li>But this is not my favorite mineral sunscreen, not at all, and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it, either.</li>
      <li>I think it clogs my pores (I make sure to use a mask 2x a week</li>
      <li>I love the texture of this sunscreen.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m okay)</li>
      <li>I love the smell of it as well.</li>
      <li>but I wish it was more creamy.</li>
      <li>Of all the facial sunscreens, this is among the best.</li>
      <li>I buy this product over and over, absolutely love it.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t even know if Gingko Biloba is safe to use in skin care products.</li>
      <li>I wish I&#x27;d done more research on that before I bought.  </li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>Fairly oily, but worth using for the healthfulness.</li>
      <li>My dermatologist recommended this product for me and I love it.</li>
      <li>This will work ok for the beach, but not as an every day sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>They must have shipped it through lightning : )  </li>
      <li>Healthy moisturizers and healthy sunblock.</li>
      <li>Bareminerals moisturizer is my favorite, but it&#x27;s way too pricey.  </li>
      <li>I love mineral fusion and use all their make up</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>This is a great sunscreen for those who want something that works great, requires minimal product, is vegan and cruelty-free.</li>
      <li>I then tried applying less than a dime-size amount on my face and was able to blend it in perfectly.</li>
      <li>(and so defeat the purpose of sunscreen) and has a surprisingly low number (that&#x27;s a good thing!)</li>
      <li>I gave this moisturizer 5 stars because it smells very good and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry.</li>
      <li>The moisturizer goes on smoothly and absorbs rather quickly and makes my skin feel very smooth.</li>
      <li>If your just going out in the sun than its fine</li>
      <li>and it is good for mature (retin A skin) protection!</li>
      <li>The sunscreen moisturizer has a light lemony scent to me and keeps me protected from the sun.  </li>
      <li>I use a mineral powder foundation and then spray lightly with a moisturizing toner for added hydration.</li>
      <li>Great texture, easy to apply, absorbs quickly (within 2 or 3 minutes), no skin reaction after several weeks of using this every day.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best facial moisturizer I have used.</li>
      <li>It also doesn&#x27;t have the same smell as most sunscreens, which is nice.</li>
      <li>And I can&#x27;t use very many products on my face, super sensitive.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s definitely a very nice light minimally noticeable smell.</li>
      <li>I love it so much I have 2-3 on hand at all times,</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t even been wearing any foundation, only under my eyes, since I began using this moisturizer, plus it has good SPF.  </li>
      <li>:  gentle formula, lovely &amp; mild herbal scent, and it *</li>
      <li>Overall the product line is very good for people with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>and it really works wonders for me, because I have really sensitive and fair</li>
      <li>; it is super softening and leaves my skin &#x27;dewy.&#x27;</li>
      <li>From its wonderful fragrance to its affect my skin, I would definitely recommend it to those who want natural ingredients and noticeable, positive effects.</li>
      <li>Give it a few minutes after you put it on for the whiteness to fade, and it works beautifully under make-up.</li>
      <li>I have gotten this a number of times, primarily because its&#x27; cruelty free, but also because it&#x27;s a decent formula.</li>
      <li>This works much better for me than my old chemical sunscreens.  </li>
      <li>I am 57 years old, fair with sensitive skin, which gets oily in the summer.</li>
      <li>did find a moisturizer with 30SPF, brand called OWN (from Central Market, for $20).</li>
      <li>and it is absorbed.  </li>
      <li>(I think that&#x27;s the right terminology)</li>
      <li>and it is just the right level of moisturizer for me.  </li>
      <li>It is very creamy and good for dry skin .</li>
      <li>I am OK with this, as I always add a little powder on top anyway, but I thought I&#x27;d endorse that</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t like this product at first, but it was because I dislike applying sunscreen and put on too much too quickly.</li>
      <li>Love the product, especially that it has no parabens in it.</li>
      <li>Mineral Fusion performs just as well with a higher SPF.  </li>
      <li>My hands-down favorite is Cetaphil Dermacontrol Moisturizer, which is affordable enough that I don&#x27;t skip in applying it</li>
      <li>but my face is always shiny at the end of the day in hot weather after using this.</li>
      <li>However, I am low-maintenance when it comes to my morning routine, and like to wear only moisturizer and some concealer most days.</li>
      <li>I have not noticed the cream &#x27;tracking&#x27; in hot weather.</li>
      <li>It has a very slight pleasant odor like eucalyptus, and the odor also is gone very soon.  </li>
      <li>I love the fact that the ingredients are good for my face, but I still have a few dry patches that I have to address with another moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to love this product, but it fell short.  </li>
      <li>The great thing about this one is it has natural ingredients and is SPF 40, higher than what I usually see (SPF 30).</li>
      <li>I really like this moisturizer.</li>
      <li>so the moisturizer I use needs to work very well with my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>Not too much moisturizer in it.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this moisturizer.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Perhaps I just don&#x27;t go through this fast enough, but mine persistently separates in the tube, so that when I squeeze it out into my hand I get a gush of oily liquid along with the cream. I actually threw away my last tube because of this problem. I tried remix it by gooshing the closed tube around in my hands (gooshing: a technical term!) but to no avail. Other reviewers are also correct that it leaves an oily sheen on the face. I am OK with this, as I always add a little powder on top anyway, but I thought I&#x27;d endorse that comment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, so far as positives, I do like that it uses optical (I think that&#x27;s the right terminology) sun blockers instead of chemical; I&#x27;m not worried about chemicals but I do find that the mineral sunscreens sting my eyes less. But this is not my favorite mineral sunscreen, not at all, and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it, either.</li>
    <li> I use this product as a sun screen. It has a pleasant aroma and the ingredients are acceptable to me.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize the SPF 40 version of the moisturizer I had been buying would be such a different texture. I usually get the standard mineral fusion face lotion.  I feel like this one makes me a tad bit oily but still useable and it&#x27;s great to not have to worry about not having the SPF.  I do prefer the regular one, it keeps me a little more matte.</li>
    <li> excellent-we love it!</li>
    <li> It is difficult to find SPF 40 day cream/lotion that moisturizes and interacts successfully with make-up, but this one does all that for me. I have been using it for a couple of years and won&#x27;t be changing anytime soon. Zinc oxide provides the protection, so you need to give the product a few moments to disappear after putting it on. You also need to shake it up well before using it!  There is little to no scent. I use a mineral powder foundation and then spray lightly with a moisturizing toner for added hydration. I have not noticed the cream &#x27;tracking&#x27; in hot weather. Good stuff!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I use it by itself and also mixed in with my foundation.  It has good SPF and is corrective - it makes your skin look good.</li>
    <li> I gave this moisturizer 5 stars because it smells very good and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry. Overall the product line is very good for people with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I love the texture of this sunscreen. It&#x27;s not too thin nor is it thick. It blends in smoothly and for some reason does not give me a white cast like others day, even though my skin color is caramel brown (or slightly lighter than that).  Love the product, especially that it has no parabens in it. It is also very affordable compared to other zinc sunscreens that come in very small containers.  The only reason I took off the star is because initially the product smells great and refreshing when applied, however after a few seconds a strong soapy &amp;#34;after&amp;#34; small occurs, which is a bit overpowering.  All in all, I will be ordering this again for sure!</li>
    <li> My wife uses this as her day cream.  Blends in nicely even with the heavy sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Not my favourite, too thick on your face, can&#x27;t wear makeup on top of this.  Good for the beach though.</li>
    <li> I like the ingredients but my face is always shiny at the end of the day in hot weather after using this.</li>
    <li> The sunscreen moisturizer has a light lemony scent to me and keeps me protected from the sun.  I am glad I bought this and will probably buy it again as soon as I run out.</li>
    <li> I did not even get burnt when I used it for a week at the beach in Jersey.  And that&#x27;s 7 days of intense sun from dawn till dusk.  Applied it at least twice a day and never peeled once.  I encourage you to try one tube hardcore and then decide for yourself.</li>
    <li> I have tried various facial lotions with SPF in them and this is my favorite one so far.  I use it every day. It is very creamy and good for dry skin . I love the smell of it as well. It is quite thick but I have no problem getting it to absorb and it is very moisturizing. Also, the price is quite good. I don&#x27;t think it would be good for oily skin however.</li>
    <li> Leaves skin too oily.</li>
    <li> I wish I&#x27;d done more research on that before I bought.  Otherwise it&#x27;s great, absorbs and protects well.  But the point of using a daily SPF moisturizer is health and safety as a whole, not just appearance and avoidance of sunburn.</li>
    <li> I used have used this daily for almost 2 years. Excellent sun protection and moisturizer. I have sensitive skin and this is the best face lotion I have found.</li>
    <li> I like it and it does work and lasts longer than other mineral sunscreens but it makes my face really shiny and greasy looking.  I have normal skin.  I wanted something to wear under my make up and although it works my face is still really shiny so I will have to find a different one for some activities.  If your just going out in the sun than its fine but if your going to a party and don&#x27;t want to look greasy then you may want to try something else.  PS.  I love mineral fusion and use all their make up but this product just didn&#x27;t work out for me so well</li>
    <li> I was using Devita moisturizer which worked great until they changed the formula.  I came across Mineral Fusion and figured I&#x27;d try it.  I absolutely love it!!  Bareminerals moisturizer is my favorite, but it&#x27;s way too pricey.  Mineral Fusion performs just as well with a higher SPF.  It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and it moisturizes very well.  I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Loved the quick service, I did not expect to get it so soon.  They must have shipped it through lightning : )  it came really fast, before expected and before the date it was promised.  I loved the price and will continue to order this product every 3 months or so. It is so expensive everywhere else and it really works wonders for me, because I have really sensitive and fair skin.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> My only problem is he consistency of the product, I think it&#x27;s probably due to the minerals but I wish it was more creamy.</li>
    <li> I have gotten this a number of times, primarily because its&#x27; cruelty free, but also because it&#x27;s a decent formula.</li>
    <li> I had a product I loved that was discontinued.  I have mature-ish, sensitive skin with a history of melanoma. I was looking for a new daily moisturizer that would give me a high spf.  I don&#x27;t wear makeup so the moisturizer I use needs to work very well with my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is great!  It is the perfect amount of moisture - my skin doesn&#x27;t get oily but still feels soft all day.  It is a little pale going on, in the way some mineral sunscreens can be, but once it&#x27;s rubbed in, I don&#x27;t see it any more.  It has not caused breakouts or irritation or redness.  It&#x27;s great!  It also scored really well on Skin Deep (environmental working group&#x27;s product database).</li>
    <li> Hydration, good SPF protection, again no animal testing</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, so I tested it on my neck and lower chin when I first bought it.  Unfortunately, I developed very large zits in the days after.  Wish it worked for me.</li>
    <li> This is the only sunscreen I have found that doesn&#x27;t make me breakout, give me a rash, or make my skin greasy. My husband comments on my skin every time I wear it; it is super softening and leaves my skin &#x27;dewy.&#x27; I have never gotten a sunburn wearing it. Since it is a mineral based sunscreen it does have a little bit of a white cast - but nothing like other natural sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried (it actually blends nicely instead of being cakey) and since I have reddish skin it helps subdue my pink cheeks a bit.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best facial moisturizer I have used. My local store ran out and I have been without for 2 weeks. I bought another moisturizer, but it doesn&#x27;t come close to this one with the SPF 40. I just bought two tubes so I can ensure I have enough on hand!</li>
    <li> This is too sticky for a daily moisturizer. Hard to spread and leaves a gooey layer on my face. Yuck.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t give this one 4 stars because it is a bit difficult to rub in. It smells good but does go on white and thick at first. I have to rub it in for a minute before the whiteness starts to fade. I think it works well other than that. I would order it again but am planning on trying another brand first that may not be as thick. The great thing about this one is it has natural ingredients and is SPF 40, higher than what I usually see (SPF 30). I think with the natural ones, the whitish film and thickness are just a given and I am willing to live with that to stay away from bad chemicals.</li>
    <li> The finest sunscreen I have found yet.  It has actually improved my skin! I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this product for me and I love it.</li>
    <li> From its wonderful fragrance to its affect my skin, I would definitely recommend it to those who want natural ingredients and noticeable, positive effects.</li>
    <li> I just started using mineral sunscreens instead of chemical ones.  This one was highly rated and I&#x27;m very happy with it.  It does go on white, but the white fades quickly and it is not white within fifteen minutes.  It has a very slight pleasant odor like eucalyptus, and the odor also is gone very soon.  This works much better for me than my old chemical sunscreens.  I wish it came in a smaller size so it would be TSA compliant.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that the ingredients are good for my face, but I still have a few dry patches that I have to address with another moisturizer.</li>
    <li> On my package it states it has Gingo Biloba in the product and on the website it doesn&#x27;t?? Huh?? I don&#x27;t even know if Gingko Biloba is safe to use in skin care products. Is it??</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer and sunblock.  I have super-sensitive skin and this product works without any irritation.  It was recommended by my dermatologist.  It lasts a long time, too.  Check out the beauty product info on the Environmental Working Group website for lots of tips about thousands of bath and body products.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little oily, but given dry skin that comes with aging, I find that a plus.  Give it a few minutes after you put it on for the whiteness to fade, and it works beautifully under make-up.</li>
    <li> All zinc based sunscreens does it, whitens your face, I think this one also blocked my pores as I got some eruptions after using it. It is too watery, you have to shake it well before using. Good protection from sun though.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this moisturizer.  I try to be a concientious consumer, and the fact that this moisturizer is vegan, hypoallergenic, and is made with natural, beneficial ingredients with sun protection convinced me to buy it.  However, I am low-maintenance when it comes to my morning routine, and like to wear only moisturizer and some concealer most days. This moisturizer left a white cast and a greasy sheen to my face, which could only be helped by layering on a lot of primer and powder, which is not ideal.  I love the company and have other Mineral Fusion products, but this moisturizer unfortunately, is going back!</li>
    <li> I love it.  It offers great protection and makes my face look good.  Of all the facial sunscreens, this is among the best.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product at first, but it was because I dislike applying sunscreen and put on too much too quickly. I then tried applying less than a dime-size amount on my face and was able to blend it in perfectly. The white sheen you see when you first apply will quickly disappear as you blend it into your face, if you don&#x27;t use too much of it. It also doesn&#x27;t have the same smell as most sunscreens, which is nice. I don&#x27;t think the product has any added fragrance but it&#x27;s definitely a very nice light minimally noticeable smell. This product does make your face shiny at first, but that doesn&#x27;t last too long. I also have drier skin, so the shininess doesn&#x27;t bother me much. I also tend to be prone to mild - moderate acne breakouts and this has not aggravated my skin at all. This is a great sunscreen for those who want something that works great, requires minimal product, is vegan and cruelty-free.</li>
    <li> I have relatively dry and sensitive skin and I have been using this product for about 1 yr and I really like it. It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy but its very hydrating. It takes about a minute for the whiteness to fade. The scent is not strong. I really like it.</li>
    <li> This is a really good sunscreen.  All natural ingredients.  No breakouts or clogging of pores.  I do wear makeup over my sunscreen and as you know sunscreen does break down after a few hours.  So I don&#x27;t have to ruin my makeup by applying again, I use the MineralFusion  brush on SPF 30 powder and it&#x27;s just has good but in powder form.</li>
    <li> Got the product mainly for my shaved head, needing protection against the Texas sun. Does the job, but leaves a visible white film (most likely from the zinc) as a moisturizer with high SPF. After half the day with it on, it may rub off like dead skin. If I go out with it, I&#x27;ll probably use a hat or beanie because I&#x27;m a little self-conscious of the white-ish scalp it gives me (because I have tan skin). Overall, decent product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did find a moisturizer with 30SPF, brand called OWN (from Central Market, for $20). Doesn&#x27;t leave a film and goes on smoother---not as thick as Mineral Fusion.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful facial moisturizer, and I especially love that it has SPF 40 in it to protect against UVA and UVB rays. I wear this everyday and have been using it for about two years. It is not very thick so be careful when you squeeze it out of the tube that you don&#x27;t get too much at a time. The moisturizer goes on smoothly and absorbs rather quickly and makes my skin feel very smooth. I like also that the product doesn&#x27;t have a lot of chemicals in it, and instead uses minerals to block the sun&#x27;s rays.</li>
    <li> This product broke me out. Will not recommend for oily face.</li>
    <li> Cons:  a little runny, is absorbed after a few minutes but later in the day it makes white lines in my wrist &amp; elbow creases&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  gentle formula, lovely &amp; mild herbal scent, and it *does* moisturize&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a decent moisturizer/high SPF/organic combination. After trying it out, I use it on my body rather than my face. Under make-up, I prefer Devita Solar Protective Moisturizer (though not for prolonged sun exposure) or Kiss My Face Face Factor Sunscreen (no white sheen). My hands-down favorite is Cetaphil Dermacontrol Moisturizer, which is affordable enough that I don&#x27;t skip in applying it (and so defeat the purpose of sunscreen) and has a surprisingly low number (that&#x27;s a good thing!) on the Skin Deep Cosmetics Database.</li>
    <li> Healthy moisturizers and healthy sunblock. Fairly oily, but worth using for the healthfulness.</li>
    <li> I spend a lot of time in the sun, biking, running, swimming, etc. So I need sunblock and I need something that really stays on after hours of sweating. I&#x27;ve found zinc oxide based products work the best for me for that purpose. 4 hour runs in the summer.... and my shoulder blades are burnt because my sunblock sweated off. And I can&#x27;t use very many products on my face, super sensitive. It works. I think it clogs my pores (I make sure to use a mask 2x a week and I&#x27;m okay), is greasy, does leave a ghostly cast (I blend it with a little Mineral Fusion BB cream that I never use [just because I hate foundation now]) and the scent is odd. The smell isn&#x27;t bad, but what would be better is unscented. Overall, I&#x27;ll keep using it for my summer training but I definitely can&#x27;t use this daily.</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen &amp; my skin felt moisturized.  Just a little too thick that why I gave it a 4.  Otherwise, a great product.</li>
    <li> Mineral Fusion Natural has exceeded my expectations. Great texture, easy to apply, absorbs quickly (within 2 or 3 minutes), no skin reaction after several weeks of using this every day. Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> disappointed with the texture I found it too thick to use on face!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this product, but it fell short.  I gave it 3 stars because it does work well as a sunblock,  I had it on all day without re-application on the 4 th of July and did not get burned.  But, the lotion leaves my already pale skin extra white, and never quite gets absorbed.  I have dry skin, but this stayed tacky feeling all day and does not moisturizer well.  As an example, several hours after applying it still left a white film on my cell phone where my face touched the screan.  Yuck.  This will work ok for the beach, but not as an every day sunscreen.  I will not be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> With a darker skin complexion, unless you are using make-up over this, this will leave a slight discoloration on your skin.</li>
    <li> I like the ingredients, but it leaves my face too shiny for my liking.  The whiteness does fade after application, but the greasy look remains.  My skin type is predominantly dry.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite day time moisturizer!  I apply it to freshly rinsed face after patting dry in am. Then brush my teeth and hair while it &amp;#34;settles&amp;#34; for a soft, moist even foundation for makeup or a dab of concealer.  No white to see and it is good for mature (retin A skin) protection!</li>
    <li> Seems to be a good product.  But I didn&#x27;t see any copper petites in the ingredient list.</li>
    <li> Not greasy once you brush/ rub it in and it is absorbed.  Took a week or two for my face to adjust to the formula but use it all the time now.  The SPF is high enough to use so that I don&#x27;t have to use a separate sun block.  Much easier having it all in one and it still moisturizes my face.</li>
    <li> I am 57 years old, fair with sensitive skin, which gets oily in the summer. I had high hopes for this product as it rated well on EWG website. To my dismay, Mineral Fusion Moisturizer with SPF significantly clogged up the pores in my face and neck within 7 or 8 hours and created worse breakouts than other products I&#x27;ve tried in the past (Jurlique, Alba). So for me, this was a waste of $$$. Went to WF and was steered towards Juice, and so far it&#x27;s much better for this sensitive blonde type!</li>
    <li> I really like this sunscreen.  It does leave a bit of a sheen or slight shine after you rub it in but it is not too bad, it lessens as it sinks in.  If I&#x27;m not wearing makeup I will just blot a little of the sheen off.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast like some sunscreens, I&#x27;m pretty pale, N25, and don&#x27;t have any problem with it.  I have combo skin and it is just the right level of moisturizer for me.  Not sure if it&#x27;s going to be too heavy for summer when I&#x27;m a little bit more oily but going to give it a try.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t even been wearing any foundation, only under my eyes, since I began using this moisturizer, plus it has good SPF.  Update ... a year + later, this is still my go to moisturizer.  I love it so much I have 2-3 on hand at all times, stock up when they go on sale.  The SPF 15 and the Intense Hydration don&#x27;t touch this, for me.</li>
    <li> I buy this product over and over, absolutely love it.  Highest sun protection I could find in a natural product that doesn&#x27;t leave your face all white.</li>
    <li> There is a serious flaws with this: For one thing, the spf moisturiser has a tendency of going opaque on your skin even when thinned out with another facial lotion or facial oil. I find this to be a bit problematic, especially if you have medium to dark skin. But the coverage you get goes a long way and you need very little of the product to do a effective job. I would still buy this in the future though with this opaqueness of this facial moisturiser, it&#x27;s going to be a very long time.</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer. Not too much moisturizer in it. Use careful not to use too much as it does go on white and if there is too much it does not totally disappear. I will try the one next time that is for dry skin instead of every skin type. Sometimes ,moisturizers can be too oily, so I was concerned about trying one that would be too heavy. I don&#x27;t think that will be a problem. Will let you know on my next purchase</li>
