      <li>Original Review 7/4/2014:  </li>
      <li>Worth the price!</li>
      <li>I have been debating because this product, be it the original one or replacement, came with almost no manufacturer warranty.</li>
      <li>Steam is quick, easy to clean and extremely useful.  </li>
      <li>This Mini Ozone Facial Steamer is good to buy in this price.</li>
      <li>I am loving this product so far.</li>
      <li>great little table top steamer- powerful, heat quickly and is compact0- love3 it.</li>
      <li>I found the construction to be very good and sturdy and washed the water holder before using and found no strong smell.</li>
      <li>Other than that, it was great for my skin and sinuses.</li>
      <li>Can you blow a fuse that  quick.</li>
      <li>They were quick to accept the issue after seeing pictures and agreed to send replacement.</li>
      <li>However, i will say the seller responded to email, and i was able to talk to a live person when calling the phone number provided.</li>
      <li>The Segawe company was very quick to fix the problem, reimburse my shipping cost immediately and were very personable to work with.  </li>

      <li>Because you can&#x27;t see very well through the steam (and it may not be good for your eyes to keep them open!)</li>
      <li>well worth it.</li>
      <li>They were kind enough to offer a replacement for $18.</li>
      <li>Product is very good to use and cheap but it hard to add the water and to high for me to use.</li>
      <li>My friend and I tried it right away.</li>

      <li>The steamer was good overall, but one of the parts we got (the steam outlet) seemed to be old and had water droplets in it.</li>
      <li>The water container never did fit well and actually came off during operation making it a huge safety concern.</li>
      <li>shipping was super fast and well packed.</li>
      <li>However when I requested them to send a replacement only if they have a NEW steamer available in stock, they decided to issue refund:).</li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend this to a friend :)</li>
      <li>The only consider is if the arm can just able will be better.&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
      <li>so I didn&#x27;t think I got any at first.</li>
      <li>It broke after the first time I used it</li>
      <li>Another thing I din, t like about this product is you can&#x27;t use the same water more than twice.</li>
      <li>and the cup that holds the water gets EXTREMELY hot.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Update: I used this steamer 3-4 times, and then it stopped working. My husband took it apart, trying to fix it, but no luck. I just put it in the trash. My advice would be to invest in a better quality machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little machine works just as well as the one at my favorite spa....I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it was the same model!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really, the only concern I have is that I will use it too frequently &#x3D;) I will say though that for women with small children, it may not be a good idea for the kids to be in the room with you while you&#x27;re steaming your face. Why? Because you can&#x27;t see very well through the steam (and it may not be good for your eyes to keep them open!) and the cup that holds the water gets EXTREMELY hot. It bubbles and has a small light, so I could understand why a young child might want to touch it, which would almost certainly result in second degree burns. I don&#x27;t have kids, so I blissfully enjoy steaming my face without a care in the world &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> excellent no complaints</li>
    <li> it saves me a lot of space and works just fine!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with my Steemer :)), is beautiful and works great</li>
    <li> It works really good, so far anyway. There is one little problem, A leaks time to time after while.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  Easy to use and works like a professional facial steamer. I highly recommend this seller as well as the product!</li>
    <li> I bought this Facial Steamer for my mom for Christmas and she uses it almost everyday! It has saved her tons of money because she usually would go to get a facial at a spa but this little guy does the trick! It is very easy to use and is also portable.</li>
    <li> Worked for one facial. Now it doesn&#x27;t  heat up!?  Can you blow a fuse that  quick. Junk!</li>
    <li> It broke after the first time I used it</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant to purchase this product since it is quite \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; compared to other facial steamer but I went by the reviews posted on here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with the quality of the product. I use it everyday and have seen a major improvement on my skin. It is also very relaxing and i have made it a part of my daily routine. When I get home and shower(rinse off my make up), I lay on my bed and steam my face and listen to meditation music and dim the lights. It will give you a good thirty minutes of steam. I follow up with exfoliating my face (twice a week) which I have always done but I have seen a major difference when I started using this. If I am not exfoliating i just follow up with my toner and moisturizer.  I also stopeed breaking out i feel like this have helped balnced my skin a lot. I would reccommend this to anybody looking for a good steamer.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a last minute birthday gift. The product arrived in a few days. My friend and I tried it right away. The results were that of a professional salon. It was easy, effective, and very relaxing. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The steamer was good overall, but one of the parts we got (the steam outlet) seemed to be old and had water droplets in it. Another thing I din, t like about this product is you can&#x27;t use the same water more than twice.</li>
    <li> This thing REALLY puts out the steam when the ozone switch is used. So much that it&#x27;s a little hard to breath at first. It does have the occasional drip but I expected that due to the nature of the product. Condensation causes it. Directions were tucked in a small cranny in the foam packaging so I didn&#x27;t think I got any at first. Seems to work very well, I am happy with the purchase and would buy it again. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the steam arm isn&#x27;t adjustable, you can&#x27;t raise and lower it. The steam head can be twisted in a circle to direct the steam though and that helps in getting a pretty good directional angle.</li>
    <li> A great buy!  The only problem I have is getting the stout to open to put water in it, but you can just take the measure cup &amp; fill it up directly.</li>
    <li> Product is very good to use and cheap but it hard to add the water and to high for me to use. I sold to my friend and she like it.</li>
    <li> thank you ..&lt;br /&gt;excellent item and fast shipping</li>
    <li> not very good product, there is no space to put vicks or other medicine for inhalation. the ozone light sometimes doesn;t work</li>
    <li> I initially had some problems with the correct item shipping.  The Segawe company was very quick to fix the problem, reimburse my shipping cost immediately and were very personable to work with.  I love my steamer!  At age 58, I still have a problem complexion and this is just what I needed to open the pores and clean the skin.  Love using it!</li>
    <li> This steamer worked great, then just stopped working after one month. It wasn&#x27;t the fuse. I couldn&#x27;t find ANY manufacturing information on the unit at all to contact the co, or to find out about warranty. There isn&#x27;t even a brand name on the unit. disappointing.</li>
    <li> I purchased this about a month ago and use it every day, sometimes twice a day! My previous steamer broke after 3 months of use so I switched to another brand entirely.  The winters here are very dry and very rough on my skin; this replenishes the moisture with just one use and helps to keep my skin clear as well. I would definitely recommend this to a friend :) Thank you!</li>
    <li> When i ordered this product is says 3 left in the stock.... but you send me totally different product.... after using it... it lookes ok so i decided to keep it... but first feelings was bad....</li>
    <li> Everyone needs this. Mine looked used when I received it. Probably a return. It works great, auto stop. Easy install, movable install so I have created positions to see if it will still work while I do whatever I want to do and it passes! Good steam but sometimes there&#x27;s a little drip (warm water-not hot or cold)</li>
    <li> I would not give it any stars the cup fell out and have gave my sister second degree burns it was horrible</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Ok guys, item arrived in ONE DAY !!!! I have never in my ten year ever gotten a package the next day. True, I live in Los Angeles and package originated from California but still. AMAZED !!! Plugged it in right away, a powerful stream makes this an amazing choice. I get facials at LA salons and this lil guy does the same job. Used it twice already ! Can&#x27;t wait to use it tomorrow again. It&#x27;s a YES&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I had one of these two years ago and I bought my girlfriend one. She loves it! She uses it on her face as well as on her hair. I don&#x27;t know what that is all about but I am glad she makes good use of it. It works very well.</li>
    <li> very cheap in its making and in trying it - I almost burnt myself twice.  It is very unsturdy and doesn&#x27;t seem like very reliable of a machine for something like a face.  No way....</li>
    <li> It worked one time then quit. Then dripped water, not what i excited, quickly disappointed. Don&#x27;t have nothing else to say.</li>
    <li> This put out enough steam but the way the arm is designed the steam comes out in an odd direction.I couldn&#x27;t find a way to lie down and have the steam hit my face comfortably.  I returned it.</li>
    <li> Edited 8/30/2014:  To recap, the unit still looks brand new like it arrived but not working properly. I managed to find time and took a picture of the steamer to send to the seller Mix Wholesale. The seller confirmed that the steamer heating unit is tilted according to the picture. They were kind enough to offer a replacement for $18. I have been debating because this product, be it the original one or replacement, came with almost no manufacturer warranty. Should i shell out another sum for the replacement which may be again short lived? Or should i just buy a new one at half price on eBay. I purchased it from Amazon at a higher price because i thought more expensive means better. Apparently that&#x27;s not the case. However, i will say the seller responded to email, and i was able to talk to a live person when calling the phone number provided. The seller also stated 60 day warranty although terms not clear. The one star is a reflection on the quality of the product itself and its durability.    Edited 8/18/2014:  After my last review on 7/4/2014 I tried to find time and attempted to use this steamer two more times to make sure it&#x27;s broken before I do a return/exchange. Unfortunately, there was almost no steam out of the steam wand. After the last use, the top of the steaming unit sorta collapsed and tilted dangerously inwards at 15% angle. I contacted the seller Mix Wholesaleon 8/17/2014 and received a reply as following:    \\&quot;We are sorry to hear that you are having a problem with an item you purchased from us and we appreciate your patience because of this. Our units come with a 60 day guarantee. Please provide a good contact number and we can have our technicians call you, or feel free to call us at 954-577-1043 \\&quot;    Since nowhere on Mix Wholesale Amazon store mentioned the 60 days guarantee, I want to share with everyone of this fact. Should I have known about this 60 days guarantee, I would either not purchased from Mix Wholesale, or inform them right when I firsthaving problem instead of trying to proof the product work. I also suggest anyone purchasing such facial steamer from any 3rd party seller to test the product fully and frequently within the 30 days Amazon return window. I know casual personal user like me may not need to use this unit more than a few time per month, but keep in mind a product working great for once does not warrant durability.    Original Review 7/4/2014:  Upon receiving the new unit, I inspected it thoroughly. There was a little rust around the base of the metal heating tube, but nothing serious enough to cause a return. Up till now, I&#x27;ve had this Table Top Mini Ozone Facial Steamer for just over one month. It&#x27;s used once a week with distilled water and 15 minute session each. The first time it was great. The steam was strong enough for my face at a one foot range. However with slow degradation, more steam is coming out of the base unit than the arm. On the fourth use, the steam reaching my face has decreased so much I had to place my face about 6 inch away and rotate my face because the steam was minimal. I use a cotton q-tip to dab the arm steam hole while steaming to remove condensation, it helped but didn&#x27;t cure the problem. I also checked the whole unit and saw no damage, no defect. The unit still looks as good as new.    Since this purchase has just passed the one month return window on Amazon, I&#x27;ll try to contact the seller and see what kind of customer support or warranty there is. I understand three usages out of this steamer still comes out cheaper than one facial. However, at this price I expected this steamer to last a few month instead of just one.</li>
    <li> I am loving this product so far. I had it for two weeks now and i have been using it every night. So far so good.</li>
    <li> This steamer is great quality for the price. Heats up quickly, had good range, and the compact size is nice.</li>
    <li> Way past my expectation.  Although I&#x27;m still confused with distilled water and tap water.  Mine only works with tap...go figure!?  Steam is quick, easy to clean and extremely useful.  I love this product which is also built to be durable.</li>
    <li> just used my new steamer .... amazing ... especially for me , because i suffer from black heads not really break outs or pimples, this thing gets all the gunk out of my face and leaves my skin feeling so great :) LOVE IT and highly recommend !!! I use this with my panasonic pore cleanser :)</li>
    <li> I bought one of these after my sister recommended it to me.  We both love these things.  It is much easier than the old style steamers you put your whole face into and it is more targeted just where you want it to be, so you can move around once a certain spot gets enough steam.  The price is right and it&#x27;s very easy to use and to store away.  My skin looks and feels so nice after I use it.  I would definitely purchase another one!</li>
    <li> This is a very great product and comes highly recommended! I use the Ion setting and its completely 100% recommended. I use it about 2-3 times a week and the result is bonafied beauty!</li>
    <li> I got this because all the humidifer have some kind of bad review some where. so i got this facial steamer instead. I got this cause i got dry and congest sinus. its the first time i use it, Very smoothing. My sinuse feels good.  The only problem is that it makes hissing sound. I wonder if I can fix that.</li>
    <li> Heats up in seconds. Powerful steam output.  Functions as advertised.Well worth the money.  Exceeds expecation.  I recommend anyone wanting to try a facial steamer to give this one a try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an aesthetician for 12 yrs and had a portable steamer like this one long ago but an old version. This one is great with the extending handle and water reservoir  on top to fill instead of removing each time. Gives a good strong stream of steam and lasts a good amount of time. Has a loud indicator sound to let you know the water is low which may be alarming so be aware of that. I found the construction to be very good and sturdy and washed the water holder before using and found no strong smell. I&#x27;m very satisfied with it for the price and the compact size it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
    <li> excellent little machine...it works really well and is so convenient</li>
    <li> This steamer functions perfect in my hand and helped a lot with my skin, highly recommend it.I even do not need to go to facial salon anymore.</li>
    <li> It worked great when I first got it. However, the wand part does not detach easily and as a result water stays in the tube and does not completely dry out.</li>
    <li> I bought the Esthology table top Steamer 8 months ago.. Looks Brand New.. Hardly used it..I turned it on today the Steam is slightly coming out and NO OZONE... What Am I to do now Repurchase a New Steamer??? Order # 108 6290370-0477017...I need a working Steamer with Ozone,,,Can you tell me to do with this Steamer?? Its no Good and I need one urgently...&lt;br /&gt;Please can you ask your Customer Service to contact me via email..cmarieskin@gmail.com&lt;br /&gt;Thank you in advance for your kind consideration....</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the power of this machine! The steam is powerful and sprays smoothly and evenly- absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> I have to use it a couple of times before come here and share experience.&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, I&#x27;m not sure if I received the right one as the picture on the box is different from the machine.and the only instruction got is from the box ,there&#x27;s no detailed manual.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, the water cup has never closed as shown in instruction. I worry if the water cup will fall down every time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;Thirdly , the steam is awesome. perfect temperature, perfect  steady and consistent .&lt;br /&gt;I usually stand up during face spa - one reason is because of the loose water cup, another reason is that position i can adjust the distance to the steam.&lt;br /&gt;so far i like it but with cautious when using it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product online and did not open within 30 days of purchasing.  Now that I have opened it and a key piece is missing they do not honor sending the missing piece because it is not within their 30 day window.  May I suggest you not order from this seller or at least open anything you have ordered right away.  It&#x27;s pretty tough to use the product when there is no bowl included to hold the water.</li>
    <li> I Can notomplain, great item, well worth it. I would recommend it for any kind of facial skin softening. Buy it</li>
    <li> Very good steamer even though I was expecting the jar to be glass it works like a dream very compact and grate for someone who wants space and is working in a small area.</li>
    <li> Very expensive for what you get. The water container never did fit well and actually came off during operation making it a huge safety concern. The ozone function was the first to go though, so I ended up not having ozone while having to prop up the water reservoir with facial towels. It was also almost impossible to thoroughly clean the pink buildup in the extending arm, which I suppose must have been some kind of mold. Other than that, it was great for my skin and sinuses. Sorry to be a downer. I loved it while it was clean and while it worked, but that was very short-lived.</li>
    <li> great little table top steamer- powerful, heat quickly and is compact0- love3 it. shipping was super fast and well packed. A+</li>
    <li> Works very well. Worth the price!</li>
    <li> Do not purchase this item from this seller. My item came previously used with stains all over the cup. &amp;#34;VERY UN-HYGENIC&amp;#34;.  I like Amazon, but their third party always comes up with some type of GAME!! Ugh I am so disgusted with my purchase from the bottom of my heart.  Big Let down!  Why would I purchase an item that has been previously used and use it for my face? Rip off. I tell you.  Then when you are e-mailing them, they act like you are speaking an entire different language.</li>
    <li> It talk less than 10 mins. to heat up the water and steam comes up so fast.  Not sure if it can stay long.  But the seller really nice to sent a follow-up email to ensure their product work fine when reached us.</li>
    <li> The item is not the same as website picture and descriptions. It&#x27;s a very cheap quality and ordinary made plastic product. I got the item which looks like a used product. I will never buy any products from this seller.</li>
    <li> I love this little steamer! Can&#x27;t be beat for the price. There are a lot of way more expensive steamers here on Amazon, but this one is very high quality. Lots of steam, last a really long time for a thorough facial.</li>
    <li> This Mini Ozone Facial Steamer is good to buy in this price. Easy set up and use. I used it as before facial massage for my costumers. The steam is event and does not leave water drop on face. No noise and can use for 10 or 15 min. The only consider is if the arm can just able will be better.&lt;br /&gt;Over all is good to buy for this price.</li>
    <li> Works!! Very cool tabletop steamer. Will auto turn off if not enough water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it all the time before DIY facials.</li>
    <li> A must have for good a beauty routine. Leaves your face feeling soft, and very relaxing. Totally amazing</li>
    <li> Although I like the product and use it frequently, I bought it and bring it to Brazil in my hand bag, I was very careful and when I tried to use it was not working, my father fixed otherwise I would have just throw it away.</li>
    <li> I received used steamer with some paste like product sticking inside the arm and water scales clearly visible in the water tank. I sent pictures as asked by their customer care to qualify for free return and replacement. They were quick to accept the issue after seeing pictures and agreed to send replacement. However when I requested them to send a replacement only if they have a NEW steamer available in stock, they decided to issue refund:). Product in such a condition should have never been sent in the first place.</li>
    <li> This leaked and spit water after two uses. Terrible. I returned it.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, and the effects are the same as at a professional spa. I&#x27;d give more stars if I could I am so very please I am with this little steamer.</li>
