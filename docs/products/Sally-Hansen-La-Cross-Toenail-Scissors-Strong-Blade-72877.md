    <li> I have tough and misshaped toe nails.  Scissors cut well. They are curved which makes them able to get under nail.&lt;br /&gt;My large fingers fit into the handle loops.  Better price than other scissors.  There were black marks on top part.&lt;br /&gt;Be careful the pointed tips are sharp.</li>
    <li> Purchased these to replace a pair I bought about 9  years earlier. I was looking for a replacement pair for about 8 months. My old pair had gotten  too dull after almost 9 years. I looked at all the stores in my town that carried these kind of scissors and I couldn&#x27;t find these,I found them on Amazon and I was and am very pleased with them.They make cutting my Mother&#x27;s toenails a quick job.Don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase these great toenail scissors.

    <li> these work fine, but it takes longer than with standard toenail clippers. They are strong enough to cut toenails, but you should soak feet beforehand.</li>
    <li> These toenail scissors have the bulk to actually cut through the toughest toenails. They are almost impossible to find in stores. I have recommended them to numerous people and they have all come back with rave reviews. As far as I&#x27;m concerned they beat the $20 and $30 brands.</li>
    <li> Could use a little more curve, but work fine.</li>
