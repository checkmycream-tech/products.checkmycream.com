    <li> I purchased these nail stickers for my sister who loves hello kitty and doing her nails. At first I wasn&#x27;t so sure about the quality because of the price; but my sister loves them and said they work perfectly. She said they stick on and stay on. They also arrived way before I expected them to come in. I&#x27;ll probably buy them again in the future.</li>
    <li> I gave her 5 stars because I did receive the product in good conditions exactly what what was offered. So happy with my HK stickers. I am using them in my nails as well as in my cell &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Very cute I love them!!!</li>
    <li> Adorable! Water decals are always easy to use.</li>
    <li> So cute, and very tiny with a glitter shine. Very fragile when removing them from the sheet otherwise easy to apply, and with a nice shiny top coat it looks so adorable.</li>
    <li> well.. im still waiting on the stickers. As soon as i get them ill be ordering the dotting tools from you (:  i hope i receive them soon....</li>
    <li> I got all my hello kitty stickers on time and complete!! I love them. The stickers are so cute as they show them in the pictures.</li>
    <li> I love all the designs and the quality is great!</li>
    <li> Smaller than expected.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how inexpensive these are how can you go wrong?! I had the girl who does my nails put these on for me. I always get a gel manicure so she did a coat of the color I wanted and let it dry in the UV light. Then she put the stickers on. Put the clear gel top coat on and let them dry under the UV light. I have had them on for about a week now and one of them is about to peel off :(  A couple of them are close to peeling off but the rest look great! The stickers themselves are really cute and sparkely! Great for the price but be careful not to touch the adhesive when putting on!</li>
    <li> great and easy with tweezers!!</li>
    <li> The decals are a bit small, more for little girl nails. I only wanted them a little bigger because I do nails but I&#x27;ll still make them work!</li>
    <li> Works as described and looks as depicted.</li>
    <li> Very nice&lt;br /&gt;5 pkgs&lt;br /&gt;Lots of decals&lt;br /&gt;Great for all size of nails&lt;br /&gt;Sparkly and cool&lt;br /&gt;Love the size of these</li>
    <li> Each design was smaller than I had anticipated but my grand daughter has small nails so they worked out fine.</li>
    <li> **  SO KIDDIE CUTE !!  **</li>
    <li> These are so cute and a whole week early!! Hooray!! Can&#x27;t wait to repaint my nails and bling them out with my hello kitty decals!!</li>
    <li> as always hello kitty nail stickers did it again love love them iwill always buy these stickers everyone loves them</li>
    <li> Just like in the pictures and just like the description say it was going to be. The stickers is the perfect size for nails.</li>
    <li> good fit, with a topcoat they stay on until i remove them. all the stickers are glittery though, in case you cant tell from the pictures. would repurchase</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh. Love it. My daughter love that there were different ones. So cute all of them.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my 3 year old granddaughter.  I was concerned that they be small enough for her tiny little nails, and indeed, most of them are!  There are a few that would be too big for now, but very nice variety of those that will be a perfect size.  Price can&#x27;t be beat! And she can always wait to use the ones that are a little bigger!  VERY PLEASED!!</li>
    <li> Very awesome product. Shipping was slow but product made it worth it.will buy again.</li>
    <li> Cute and fun!!  They are easy to stick on and last for a long time, if you put a coat of clear polish over it  My daughter and I love them!</li>
    <li> I love these stickers and I used them so much when I used to paint my nails. I don&#x27;t anymore but they&#x27;re still cute.</li>
    <li> These were adorable, as Hello Kitty, and Cats, are. They arrived quickly from seller, and in great condition. I bought extras to keep. You could also use them as Party Favors for all kinds of functions, and for young or old. They wore well, too. I am pleased with both product and Seller. I would buy again from this Seller.</li>
    <li> I got these for birthday treat bags.  These are super cute and they&#x27;re just the right size for little girls.  Each package has quite a few stickers.</li>
    <li> Good product, very cute and easy.  My 7 and 9 year old daughter wore them for a week and the sticker remained on their nail in perfect condition.  I simply applied the sticker and went over it with a top coat.  I will purchase these again when I run out.</li>
    <li> thank you very much is exactly what is described in the information , I would give more than  stars and of curse I will bay whit you...</li>
    <li> I loved these decals. I am a Hello Kitty fan and was very happy with this purchase. They were all different and very cute. Would definitely order again!</li>
    <li> LUV These. Super cute</li>
    <li> Although it said &amp;#34;Assortmemt&amp;#34; 3 of the 5 sheets were the same sticker. They do work well. Applied my nail polish, let dry and then the sticker. Rub them well and use a top coat to seal on. Still looking good after 12 days!</li>
    <li> We love Hello Kitty and these are cute and they stay on long for little hands. Lots of stickers! A variety of designs and we will buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> We found it (the actual size) of the stickers was a bit large, and didn&#x27;t fit so well on fingernails, especially children&#x27;s.  I&#x27;t a cute product, but didn&#x27;t work out so well for us.</li>
    <li> These are super cute. I ordered them for my daughter who loves Hello Kitty. They are easy to use and nice quality.</li>
    <li> These are cute for having fun looking nails. They lay practically flat on the nail and you only need one top coat to protect it, since they are so flat. The top coat does not affect the stickers that are glittery either!</li>
    <li> good product, I would like to choose only the ones I like but I would buy it again</li>
    <li> Husband bought these for me and I love them!!  super cute all different designs and they last forever with a topcoat.. just perfect lil accents clouds n bows n flowers..go perfect with different Hello Kitty Themes..</li>
    <li> They are so much fun to use them on my daughter.</li>

    <li> Really cute and easy to apply.</li>
    <li> I received these yesterday in the mail, pretty fast delivery. I bought them for my 3 year old daughters who are obsessed with hello kitty.  I tried them on and placed a top coat over their nails, very cute, and a wide selection for under $6.00. Great product.</li>
    <li> The are cute, but the stickers are a bit thick, so they so to stay on as long as the thinner ones.</li>
    <li> Stickers came quickly and they are great!  Easy to take off and apply.  Awesome price!</li>
    <li> Very cute got this for my younger sister she definitely gonna love this.</li>
    <li> Cute little nail decals! These are great for beginners to nail art. Just stick it on and top with clear coat. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Cute and my little girl loved them. Very easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Stickers stayed on my 5-year-old&#x27;s fingernails for a week with topcoat on top, even through handwashing and baths.  Very cute.</li>
    <li> Purchased for a gift.  LIked by recipient.</li>
    <li> These little stickers are very cute (possibly knockoffs, but that just adds humor and character, right?) and they last FOREVER when you use a base coat and cover with a clear top coat. I mean over a week. I am a nurse and am hard on my fingernails, these lasted. Also some of the engrish was very entertaining. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift and it got great reviews.  A large assortment of pictures to be placed on the nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They held up well. The receiver was pleased. She was an adult.</li>
    <li> The stickers are soooo cute! It&#x27;s a great price too! The dollar store by my house sells one for $1. Good thing I bought them here^^</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my five-year-old, who loves Hello Kitty.  The stickers are easy to use and come off easily with nail polish remover.  They don&#x27;t last too long, but what can you expect from nail decals?  The designs throughout the five pack are cute and give her a lot to work with.</li>
    <li> Soooo flipping cute. I got this for my 16 year niece who is obsessed with Hello kitty. Not sure how well they work but purley based on looks they are cute.</li>
    <li> Loved it could not find anywhere else! Great product shipping was faster than expected highly RECCOMEND!</li>

    <li> These are sooo cute! I had to try them as soon as they arrived. They make for a super-easy Hello Kitty manicure/pedicure! I would definitely buy these nail art stickers again.</li>
    <li> They r cute little designs 4 Hello kitt. Fans</li>
    <li> These are amazing. Just make sure to use a decent top coat because these do not stick well, but the pictures are perfect so it doesn&#x27;t bug me.</li>
    <li> As my daughter looks at me do my nails.  She wants hers done with a cat.  So I found these cute hello kitty ones that seem to kit her just right.  A little bigger and they would not fit her 3 year old nails.  They look really cute on her and she loves it.</li>
    <li> These are the cutest perfect size for my daughters nails thought they would be to big but these are the perfect size  thank you so much</li>
    <li> Very cute, great for all Sanrio fans!</li>
    <li> These r perfect for my granddaughers nails.  Applied properly they stay beautiful for about 10 days when I applied this under the top coat of my gel polish.</li>
    <li> Adorable!!!!! Great buy</li>
    <li> These nail stickers r fun and easy to use. I recieved 5 packages only 2 were duplicate.  They have a hard time staying on your nail at first so u really have to make sure everything is dry b4 u stick it on your nail .. Shipping was good took a little while to get to me but hey for the price I&#x27;ll wait..</li>
    <li> So many cute designs - Easy to apply.  Recommend a couple coats of clear topcoat as the stickers start sliding around eventually</li>
    <li> Love hello kitty and lots of stickers. Will buy more.</li>
    <li> Love the Hello Kitty stickers for the nails! I did my daughter&#x27;s nails along with my nieces and they were a hit! All different sets, will order from again.</li>
    <li> Very cute, of course.  Hello Kitty assorted nail stickers and 3 of the packs have a subtle glitter to them.  My assorted packs were baby HK, HK school theme, HK with flowers, Angel HK with clouds, winter HK.</li>
    <li> So many in this package!  My daughter has had a couple on her toenails now for a couple of weeks, so they last longer than I expected.  I feel this was a great deal for us. It makes my daugher and her friends happy and that it what matters most.</li>
    <li> So cute. So many designs</li>
