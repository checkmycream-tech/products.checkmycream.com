      <li>I guess it was fine</li>
      <li>Not for first time users as this is a very strong solution.  </li>
      <li>Product works very well, however I discovered you can make your own at home cheaply.  </li>
      <li>Goes on smoothly and  neutralizes the peel so don&#x27;t need baking soda and water solution.works</li>

      <li>This product is amazing, after my facial peel I applied this neutralizer and it worked even better than the brand my dermatologist used.  </li>
      <li>I do peels often and this product certainly does what it says it will do when you rinse your peel off and want to be sure the product has stopped working as to not over peel.  </li>
      <li>I wanted to try something professionally made before trying to make my own neutralizer.</li>
      <li>and you can make a baking soda paste that is just as effective, if not more effective than this product.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this with my glycolic peel and it helps to calm the burning sensation from the peel and feel it is needed for anyone using a peel.</li>
      <li>Skin felt perfectly calm.</li>
      <li>I completely stopped using it and just used water and baking soda instead, worked much better.</li>
      <li>but this product is worth it so buy it.</li>
      <li>so I think its better than the old skool baking soda mix.</li>
      <li>It is well worth the price.</li>
      <li>I used it right after my chemical peel.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have to use much solution and it instantly takes away the burn without adding any more burning!</li>
      <li>i turned back to my good old, faithful baking soda to neutralize my peel.</li>
      <li>some of the other review suggest and make my own.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t know how to rate this one.</li>
      <li>This product helped to neutralize the acid when the burn was too much to handle.</li>
      <li>fancy, doesn&#x27;t really moisturize, but does help ease the&lt;br /&gt;unbearable</li>
      <li>That one burns too much</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used this as often as I thought I would, but the times I have it worked very well.</li>
      <li>After applying the Neutralizer it really helped the redness and burning sensation.</li>
      <li>I used to apply baking soda paste, but this is much cleaner, not as abrasive and easier to apply.</li>
      <li>This can stop the burn and the damage that applying to much too soon will do.</li>
      <li>It helped in soothing my skin from the acid and it really do help in neutralizing the skin after the burn.</li>
      <li>Its very soothing for my face and worked very well.</li>
      <li>Honestly, this bottle may last me a long while</li>
      <li>it is well worth it and neutralizes instantly without the stinging burn so many other products give.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I am 33 with acne pock marks, fine lines &amp; rough skin texture.</li>
      <li>My skin feels very soft and hydrated afterwards.</li>
      <li>However I bought a neutralizer with my first peel and decided to buy it with my second peel.  </li>
      <li>I am using an acid peel product which can be a little too strong.</li>
      <li>Splash your face with cool water several times and you get the same results.</li>
      <li>But, I would reccomend it to anyone with sensitive skin..</li>
      <li>I received complete.</li>
      <li>I would go so far as to say I would not do a peel without it.  </li>
      <li>baking soda is also a cheap way to neutralize after applying the the chemical peels, but i also use this as post peel treatment for a few days.</li>
      <li>so I use this neutralizer and it makes my skin feel dewy and soft.</li>
      <li>I have only used this once so far</li>
      <li>This acid neutralizer has been effective in deactivating the effects of the acid peel when the pain becomes uncomfortable.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t feel like it neutralized anything. In fact, it felt like it burned more.</li>
    <li> Works well when peeling. You also get a lot of product so great value for the price.!</li>
    <li> Well...i only realized when i got it, that it was basically baking soda &amp; water. It did stop the burning, thereby neutralizing the glycolic acid. I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> I guess it was fine I used it to neutralize acid and it didn&#x27;t sting!</li>
    <li> I really love this product. Its very soothing for my face and worked very well. I used it right after my chemical peel. It stop the burning sensation on my face. I would buy it again!</li>
    <li> I use it after glycolic medical grade peels.  I do the baking soda and water wash to stop the sting and then rinse. Then,  I use cotton balls to bathe my face in this stuff and it is great.  I would go so far as to say I would not do a peel without it.  I do not think the baking soda is enough, at least with medical grade peels. This stops the final stinging for me and keeps the blistering and peeling to a minimum while still allowing for the exfoliation.</li>
    <li> This is the neutralizer that you must have on hand with the TCA peel but do have baking power water solution too.</li>
    <li> After I apply my peel my face feels dry and tight so I use this neutralizer and it makes my skin feel dewy and soft.</li>
    <li> Using this as a neutralizer with TCA Acid for tattoo removal. It&#x27;s works great and almost immediately taking the burn away.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this as often as I thought I would, but the times I have it worked very well.</li>
    <li> Works well. Does what it said. I wanted to try something professionally made before trying to make my own neutralizer. I use a lot of it so wish it came in bigger batches.</li>
    <li> i have only ised about 6 times. i have seen no changes in my skin discoloration, but i have noticed slighlty smaller pores. i like it and i hope that after more use i will see more even skin tone.</li>
    <li> I know Skin Obsession recommends a baking soda and water for neutralizing the sting.  However I bought a neutralizer with my first peel and decided to buy it with my second peel.  It helps with relieving the sting of the peel.  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Very useful.  Good price.</li>
    <li> Feels wonderful after the sting of the peel!</li>
    <li> Delivered rather quickly and worked great.</li>
    <li> This seriously helps and does its job. Honestly, this bottle may last me a long while but it burned me even more after a tca peel 30%. Boy oh boy, I thought my face was on fire even more so after the peel but I&#x27;ve decided only to use with lighter peels like glycolic and lactic and I&#x27;ll be using the baking soda and water recipe otherwise but this product is worth it so buy it. I highly recommend. Also to warn and advise to use with lighter peels not with tca peels. That one burns too much</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful.  Works immediately and continues to work after the application.  It works way better than the baking soda and water solution that I was using.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s your run-of-the-mill neutralizer.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing fancy, doesn&#x27;t really moisturize, but does help ease the&lt;br /&gt;unbearable burning of an acid peel fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Good product, nothing fancy.</li>
    <li> It works with the lactic acid, it does neutralize the acid or any acid use for skincare, so it won&#x27;t burn the skin. I would recommended it.</li>
    <li> It helped in soothing my skin from the acid and it really do help in neutralizing the skin after the burn.</li>
    <li> Worked well with the peel!</li>
    <li> Great for making sure peel is neutralized. Just wish the drying alcohol did not have to be included in this product.</li>
    <li> Worked well with the peel.</li>
    <li> very good product, meets expectations. Also EXCELLENT customer service by Dermalure</li>
    <li> I do peels often and this product certainly does what it says it will do when you rinse your peel off and want to be sure the product has stopped working as to not over peel.  I think its a very good neutralizer and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Great to use around eye area when cleaning off the peel!  I think it is a must have , along with the baking soda and water made up previous to doing a peel.</li>
    <li> I have been performing TCA peels on myself for about 3 years now.  I have used a few different products but this one is by far the best bang for your buck.  Not for first time users as this is a very strong solution.  Love it and the results I have received from using it..</li>
    <li> I got this product along with 50% TCA peel. it works as described! I recommend this product for anyone who wants to do at home peels, its always good to have it on hand just incase!</li>
    <li> I purchased this with my glycolic peel and it helps to calm the burning sensation from the peel and feel it is needed for anyone using a peel.</li>
    <li> Used this with salycilic acid and glycolic acid and did not notice it helping to neutralize the acid in anyway. I completely stopped using it and just used water and baking soda instead, worked much better. Not sure what the ingredients of this are but I feel like it was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I am using an acid peel product which can be a little too strong. This acid neutralizer has been effective in deactivating the effects of the acid peel when the pain becomes uncomfortable. I would recommend the seller to anyone who choses to buy this product.</li>
    <li> Perfect for after chemical peel. I don&#x27;t have to use much solution and it instantly takes away the burn without adding any more burning!</li>
    <li> You can make the very same thing at home with just using baking soda &amp; water...of course you won&#x27;t get all the other stuff they don&#x27;t want you to see...that&#x27;s why they don&#x27;t list their label or ingredients...A BIG NO-NO!!! Ridiculous!</li>
    <li> baking soda is also a cheap way to neutralize after applying the the chemical peels, but i also use this as post peel treatment for a few days. I wash my face and apply ph balance - like you would a toner solution.The product makes my skin feel soft and prevents my skin from excessive drying. i love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i expect my skin to look dry after the chemical peel but this helps my skin with a softer transition after the peel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I bought this neutralizer. The acid peel burned like hell. As soon as I put it on my face this neutralizer it did its job. so I&#x27;m pretty happy about it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> I use this neutralizer every time I do a chemical peel and it works great to deactivate the acid. Great product!</li>
    <li> nice product. I love it alot. i will post you the images soon and later.</li>
    <li> This worked great on several moles that were bugging my bra line and necklace area. Took a couple weeks but super easy if you&#x27;re patient! Mine kept leaking in the bag so I used gloves and always kept it upright, though.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing, after my facial peel I applied this neutralizer and it worked even better than the brand my dermatologist used.  I would recommend this brand to any one.</li>
    <li> As soon as I wash the peel off, I apply this with a cotton ball and it works very quickly. The only reason I gave it a 4 star, I wish it came with a little spray nozzle so I could use less of it, insted of applying it with a cotton ball. Other then that, its a great product!</li>
    <li> Good item to have when using astringent acids for skin peels, tag removal etc. This can stop the burn and the damage that applying to much too soon will do. A must have item.</li>
    <li> Product works very well, however I discovered you can make your own at home cheaply.  You just need baking soda and some water and you can make a baking soda paste that is just as effective, if not more effective than this product.  This products major feature is that it is convenient and there is much less of a mess.</li>
    <li> I am 33 with acne pock marks, fine lines &amp; rough skin texture. I have been using the HQ+ peel from Skin Laboratories to improve my skin. I was using baking soda &amp; water as a neutralizer but I wanted to try a stronger peel so I decided I needed a \\&quot;real\\&quot; neutralizer to ensure that I don&#x27;t damage my skin. I used this with my HQ+ peel &amp; felt zero stinging or pain. It definitely does what it says!</li>
    <li> Works well. Use it to neutralize a 40% glycolic.</li>
    <li> I usually just use a mix of baking soda and water post peel.  This product didn&#x27;t leave me with a ultra dry feel so I think its better than the old skool baking soda mix.</li>
    <li> Takes the burn away instantly!</li>
    <li> To neutralize a peel and it works, but I still felt tingling sensation even though the chemical peel was very mild. Would I buy again ? maybe not</li>
    <li> I would reccomend it, But if you use your facial peels properly then cold water is really all you need.. But, I would reccomend it to anyone with sensitive skin..</li>
    <li> Good product. Helps reduce the tingling feeling of the glycolic acid peel. It reduces the feel of burning after peel.</li>
    <li> works well, but it&#x27;s strong</li>
    <li> This product did do as it says, but I don&#x27;t think you need it.  Splash your face with cool water several times and you get the same results.</li>
    <li> I have only used this once so far but it was so soothing and calming I will be using it every time I do a peel.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work for tat removal</li>
    <li> The price is great and it does relieve the post peel stinging sensation. It is probably body chemistry related, but whenever I use it, the reaction causes my skin to smell really weird and slightly unpleasant. My skin feels very soft and hydrated afterwards.</li>
    <li> I love this product - it is mild yet effective! Would recommend the use of it to my friends!  No issues with the shipment.</li>
    <li> This is baking soda, water, and preservatives. I feel like an idiot for buying it. Next time, I&#x27;ll just mix and water and baking soda instead.</li>
    <li> works as it says and relieves any stinging, I used it to remove some skin tag with some acid I bought and it so soothing.&lt;br /&gt;A+</li>
    <li> Bought this with the skin peel. Didn&#x27;t notice any change after using it so I hope the peel doesn&#x27;t leave a scar</li>
    <li> Bought this with a chemical peel. works great. very good price for what its worth..&lt;br /&gt;but instead of using this you can just wash off the peel.</li>
    <li> this crap didnt work. i turned back to my good old, faithful baking soda to neutralize my peel. this is as good as water!</li>
    <li> Works great!  Does what it its meant to do. No bad smell either!</li>
    <li> Yes I liked this product at first i was i little skeptical. I used baking soda and Acid Neutralizer. This is a good product for purchase.</li>
    <li> I received complete. thank you.</li>
    <li> Works great skin came to its natural ph balance within seconds of applying. Skin felt perfectly calm. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This product works great for after your peel! Goes on smoothly and  neutralizes the peel so don&#x27;t need baking soda and water solution.works well after tca glycolic and lactic peels! I&#x27;d buy it again!</li>
    <li> Do not purchase the peal that goes with this neutralizer, it is not effective and not worth the effort to use. The Neutralizer is a little slow in relieving the burn of the other products.</li>
    <li> After doing a glycolic peel my skin turned apple red. After applying the Neutralizer it really helped the redness and burning sensation. I used to apply baking soda paste, but this is much cleaner, not as abrasive and easier to apply.</li>
    <li> I guess it does what its suppose to. I thing once this runs out I will do like some of the other review suggest and make my own.</li>
    <li> This product helped to neutralize the acid when the burn was too much to handle. Caution though because using this in the acid burns like hell before it gets better so dont wait until the pain is unbearable before using this product. Works great though, would recommend.</li>
    <li> No changes on my skin and the product doesn&#x27;t come with directions and nothin changed &#x27;till the moment.its almost all gone and my skin is still the same.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t know how to rate this one. I&#x27;ve never used it before and I&#x27;m doing research on it now before it&#x27;s used and it&#x27;ll be tested beforehand also. I do know that it&#x27;s a very nice bottle that will make a nice edition to my Ink well Collection.&lt;br /&gt;It has lots of information about the product on the side and there is is almost no smell with this product.</li>
    <li> Forget baking soda and any other home neutralizers you have thought about this is what you want.  it is well worth it and neutralizes instantly without the stinging burn so many other products give.  I would never use another neutralizer after using this one.  I have used it with TCA LA and GA peels with multiple clients.  It is well worth the price.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t bother buying this product. Buy 1.25 box of baking soda &amp; mix it with water. you just save yourself  some money .</li>
    <li> It immediately stops the stinging of the glycolic peel. It do not  sting like baking soda and it&#x27;s very simple to use apply solution to cotton ball and  wipe across face. Then rinse face with cold water. My only complaint it do not come with instructions on how to use. I had to read other reviews to figure out how it was suppose to be used.</li>
