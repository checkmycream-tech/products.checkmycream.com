### Positive Reviews

      <li>I cannot be happier these winter months as every product I use including Gorgeous are compatible with my skin!</li>
      <li>Unless you already have flawless skin, Benefit&#x27;s Some Kind-a Gorgeous won&#x27;t do anything for you.</li>
      <li>but this blended beautifully into my skin so you can&#x27;t even tell its there.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is great for me.  </li>
      <li>This product is great.</li>
      <li>Happy hunting.</li>
      <li>I bought this product from all the great reviews.</li>
      <li>If you are not trying to cover a ton of blemishes, this will work great for you.  </li>
      <li>I tried this after reading some good reviews, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be THIS good!  </li>
      <li>I love it!!</li>
      <li>It is very smooth and I am very impressed</li>
      <li>(if you would like/need more coverage) and you have a flawless and highlighted glow.</li>
      <li>Kind-A Gorgeous.   </li>
      <li>Apply with sponge provided (fingers don&#x27;t do as good a job) and wait 1 minute, look into mirror and</li>
      <li>Good for oily and congested skin.  </li>
      <li>I love Some Kind-A Gorgeous because I can&#x27;t even tell I am wearing it, unless I look at my face and see how radiant my skin looks!</li>
      <li>This foundation faker in this set are PERFECT for any special occasion, wedding, prom, etc.</li>
      <li>Kind of Gorgeous</li>
      <li>This gave my skin a nice texture and had good coverage for what I was looking for but....</li>
      <li>Absolutely love it!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>It also pairs nicely with their industrial concealer Boi-ing which I have in #02.</li>
      <li>Evens out my skin tone and makes it look like my own skin..</li>
      <li>If I find a pimple or two though I have to use my own concealer over this foundation.</li>
      <li>I bought \\&quot;some Kind of Gorgeous-deep\\&quot;, the \\&quot;Get even\\&quot; powder in 3 and erase paste in 3.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like it, but if you like the utra-sheer foundations, you may find it nice, but</li>
      <li>It blends in so nicely to my skin</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also great to layer on top of You Rebel (benefit foundation) for more coverage.</li>
      <li>(I have THAT kind of skin.)  </li>
      <li>After reading all of the reviews I gave it a shot and wanted to own this very cute compact, and I am glad that I did.</li>
      <li>I can easily use a cream or a powder blush with this foundation and both blend easily and looks gorgeous!</li>
      <li>I normally use 7-15 beauty products - with this, some good mascara, and a bit of lip/cheek stain, I felt gorgeous and polished!</li>
      <li>it blends wonderfully, covers all redness, and really gives me a healthy, dewy glow.</li>
      <li>However, since using the makeup (for 5 days now), I have to say my skin is smooth and soft and still looks bright and flawless at the end of the day (8 hours) when I&#x27;m dragging!!</li>
      <li>it settled into all of my fine lines and wrinkles and magnified them!</li>
      <li>It goes on very smooth.</li>
      <li>If you like Dr. Feelgood, you will love this.  </li>
      <li>I love Benefit makeup.</li>
      <li>It makes you feel like putting more on to the areas you wish to conceal, but you can add more and more, and it still doesn&#x27;t hide anything, but rather, leaves you with a powdery oily layer on your face.  </li>
      <li>I love this foundation.  </li>
      <li>I like it much better.</li>
      <li>my boyfriend is always touching my face now.</li>
      <li>There are much better products out there than this one, in my opinion.</li>
      <li>It is more for evening skin tone.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m certainly glad that I did.</li>
      <li>I am glad I stopped.</li>
      <li>which is hotter and more humid than hell,</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have many imperfections to hide</li>
      <li>I do find that I get better coverage from using a foundation brush though, as opposed to the sponge that comes with it.  </li>
      <li>It makes your face look finished, but not \\&quot;masky\\&quot;, like most liquid foundations.  </li>
      <li>Will continue to buy these products and may branch out to get more.</li>
      <li>I found I was touching up after 2-3 hours.</li>
      <li>What could be better?  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Rush hour, a new benefit product, is also a great one to check out if you&#x27;re looking for a cheek and lip color in one.</li>
      <li>foundation is perfect in the summer, it is so light weight and sheer that I feel and look like I&#x27;m not wearing anything.  </li>
      <li>And that kind of \\&quot;natural\\&quot; radiance (in my opinion) is certainly worth the price.    </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for full or medium coverage, this will not deliver!</li>
      <li>I also think it runs out very quickly.</li>
      <li>I love this makeup for it&#x27;s lightness and natural look...when I am in a hurry, I put it on and can just run out the door and look good.</li>
      <li>As a loyal benefit client, I have found this to be my favorite product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also oil free</li>
      <li>This foundation goes on smooth but is oily.</li>
      <li>It makes my skin look glowing and smooth and shine free.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s creamy and smooth and</li>
      <li>so the color was always off, no matter how light I got it.</li>
      <li>I have light fair skin, in Bare Minerals</li>
      <li>I was so excited about it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say Some Kind-a Gorgeous gives you a fresh, natural, \\&quot;I still look like me, just better\\&quot; look.    </li>
      <li>I think this will not work on very fair nor very dark skin.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;d most certainly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>and I think I may need more coverage in certain areas.</li>
      <li>This is going on my list of faves, right up there with Get Even and Benetint!</li>
      <li>but I really looks nice and not fake.</li>
      <li>Still, free sample, worth a try.    </li>
      <li>For my second attempt I applied a makeup primer (really my usual night moisturizer, Decleor Rose d&#x27;Orient Night Balm, but it works marvelously as a primer as well) and tried again.    </li>
      <li>as long as you use a good moisturizer (I use Kiehls)</li>
      <li>Looks good all day long!  </li>
      <li>I have fair skin and this is WAY to dark (in the light selection)</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what some other people did to put it on, but I get amazing coverage off of this baby!  </li>
      <li>My first attempt ended up looking decent, better than the mineral makeup, but showing clumps of pigment and highlighting the dryness of my skin despite moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>Some Kind-A Gorgeous is wonderful for pale skin, but it works really well on my friend whose a little darker than I am.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t have any problems when I use Urban Decay&#x27;s De-skick powder to set this foundation, amazing combo.</li>
      <li>This works very well if you apply it lightly and use a separate concealer for any problem areas.  </li>
      <li>I prefer a more natural look.  </li>
      <li>Just like the first trial of this foundation faker, it glided on smoothly, felt light and looked fresh and natural.</li>
      <li>The only problem is that I use it up quickly because I love it so much!!</li>
      <li>you can see right through it.  </li>
      <li>When I&#x27;m finished smoothing it on in the morning, it doesn&#x27;t even really look like I&#x27;ve got a face full of makeup on.</li>
      <li>Wow, I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this.  </li>
      <li>Instead, it just looks as if my skin has suddenly become clearer, smoother, and more dewy.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 52 year old Latina with medium brown skin. I read the reviews and decided to try the product after finding that Bobbi Brown makeup does not seem to be doing the job for me. I&#x27;ve been using BB for about 5 years. I have somewhat dry skin (with age) and dark pigmentation spots around my cheeks. My skin tends to look sallow after a few hours and I was looking for something to smooth it out and perk it up. Well, I found it!! I bought \\&quot;some Kind of Gorgeous-deep\\&quot;, the \\&quot;Get even\\&quot; powder in 3 and erase paste in 3. The erase paste is pinkish and too dark for my skin so I&#x27;m replacing it with the #2. However, since using the makeup (for 5 days now), I have to say my skin is smooth and soft and still looks bright and flawless at the end of the day (8 hours) when I&#x27;m dragging!! I am serious! I&#x27;ve tended to use oil based makeup to support my dry skin and took a risk with this foundation-- I love it!! as long as you use a good moisturizer (I use Kiehls) you do not need to worry about your skin looking dry. The SKoG is a base foundation and is light so it does not cover the pigmentation but I use the Erase paste that I brush on and then cover with the Get Even powder to set. The powder in #3 is fine for me giving me a slight \\&quot;tan\\&quot;. You may prefer #2. My friends and family say I look \\&quot;fresher\\&quot; and not so tired looking. so, I&#x27;m sold!</li>
    <li> I like this product. It goes on very smooth. It&#x27;s natural looking as well and buildable if you need it. However, if you tend to have oily skin...  it just doesn&#x27;t have the staying power. I found I was touching up after 2-3 hours. Don&#x27;t think I will purchase again. Will continue on my journey to find a foundation that doesn&#x27;t slide off my face by noon!  Happy hunting.</li>
    <li> This product is a foundation faker, that means that it is sheer coverage, if you&#x27;re looking for a fresh glowing look, this is it, if you looking for evened out skin tone, look no further.  If you are looking to hide tons of problem areas or even just one large zit, this is not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This foundation is perfect in the summer, it is so light weight and sheer that I feel and look like I&#x27;m not wearing anything.  If I find a pimple or two though I have to use my own concealer over this foundation. Benefit has also been listening to it&#x27;s consumers and now has three different shades for everyone.  I have light fair skin, in Bare Minerals I&#x27;m Fairly Light, yet the medium adds just a hint (a tiny hint) of color and it doesn&#x27;t look orange on me.  I might go to Sephora and try the light just to see how different it is on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also oil free and I don&#x27;t have any problems when I use Urban Decay&#x27;s De-skick powder to set this foundation, amazing combo.</li>
    <li> Yes, anything can be counterfeit even cosmetics.  Just giving you a heads up.  I&#x27;ve done my research!  Don&#x27;t buy from Philly Cosmetics.</li>
    <li> I love this makeup for it&#x27;s lightness and natural look...when I am in a hurry, I put it on and can just run out the door and look good. Evens out my skin tone and makes it look like my own skin..I travel with it everywhere.</li>
    <li> After my Cover Girl makeup was discontinued, I was at a loss for what foundation to do next.  I have yellow undertones to my skin (Mexican/Korean mix to give you a bit of an idea) and the new foundation numbers of Cover Girl were more pinkish.  Even their \\&quot;beiges\\&quot; were either too pink or WAY too dark for my skin. So after struggling for over an hour trying to find a foundation that would match me, I went up to the benefit counter and asked if she could recommend anything.  She tried a number of different Neutrogena and Cover Girl products on me, at first, just because I was originally hesitant with buying a new brand.  Finally, after almost exhausting options for both those lines, she offered that I try Some Kind-A Gorgeous.     It blends in so nicely to my skin and I honestly don&#x27;t find it heavy at all. I do find that I get better coverage from using a foundation brush though, as opposed to the sponge that comes with it.  I never thought I&#x27;d find something that could match my skin tone, even it out, and look natural all at the same time.  I&#x27;m VERY impressed with Benefit and I&#x27;d most certainly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This foundation goes on smooth but is oily. Although coverage is decent, it emphasizes my large pores on my nose and highlights my crow&#x27;s feet. There are much better products out there than this one, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> This works very well if you apply it lightly and use a separate concealer for any problem areas.  It evens out your complexion in a very unobvious way.  Looks good all day long!  Good for oily and congested skin.  It makes you look like your not wearing any foundation and that you don&#x27;t need too!  What could be better?  Absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> Wow, I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this.  I have really light skin and at first I was a little afraid the \\&quot;one shade fits all\\&quot; thing wasn&#x27;t going to work for me because You Rebel didn&#x27;t :( but this blended beautifully into my skin so you can&#x27;t even tell its there.  It makes my skin look glowing and smooth and shine free.  I don&#x27;t know what some other people did to put it on, but I get amazing coverage off of this baby!  The only problem is that I use it up quickly because I love it so much!!</li>
    <li> This product is great. I am an African-American woman and was approached by a sales rep at Macy&#x27;s. I am glad I stopped. It makes my skin look flawless. I don&#x27;t have many imperfections to hide but I really looks nice and not fake. I also purchased the mascara and it makes my lashes look awesome. Will continue to buy these products and may branch out to get more.</li>
    <li> I got this as a sample from Sephora and gave it a shot.  Normally I use mineral makeup, as that&#x27;s the least reactive with my skin and lasts longer than two seconds, but I generally dislike wearing foundation because it looks like I applied it with a trowel.  (I have THAT kind of skin.)  I prefer a more natural look.  I was somewhat wary of the \\&quot;one shade fits most\\&quot; claim because I&#x27;m invariably never one of the \\&quot;most\\&quot; meant.  Still, free sample, worth a try.    My first attempt ended up looking decent, better than the mineral makeup, but showing clumps of pigment and highlighting the dryness of my skin despite moisturizer.  For my second attempt I applied a makeup primer (really my usual night moisturizer, Decleor Rose d&#x27;Orient Night Balm, but it works marvelously as a primer as well) and tried again.    Soft-focus perfect 50&#x27;s pinup skin was the result.  You know the pictures where you KNOW they&#x27;re wearing makeup because no one has skin that perfect?  Even under harsh lighting.  The coverage was sheer enough that I still looked human, no trowel appeared to have been involved, and it LASTED for hours and hours.  Makeup normally vanishes within three hours on me.  The shade also blends decently with my skin tone.    I do recommend this if you prefer sheer coverage (it&#x27;s not a spackle-on product), and it&#x27;ll be best applied over some sort of primer.  I think I have a new foundation that WORKS finally.</li>
    <li> Before I bought this I used liquid foundation, but that stuff sucks in the summer, plus I&#x27;m really really pale so the color was always off, no matter how light I got it. Some Kind-A Gorgeous is wonderful for pale skin, but it works really well on my friend whose a little darker than I am. It smooths my complextion and does not move! Not even in Kentucky July, which is hotter and more humid than hell, I swear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend you use the sponge it comes with, instead invest in a foundation brush or some disposable sponge wedges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not really meant to be a cover-up though for scars or acne.</li>
    <li> I have always hated foundation.  Wit a passion, actually.  This stuff is great for me.  I do not have any major skin blemishes that need hiding, but I do have some redness here and there.  This evens it right out, does not feel like foundation at all, and is idiot proof for application, you don&#x27;t have to worry about that foundation line around your jawline that I see so often.  It blends right in, and it leaves your skin sooo soft</li>
    <li> man, I am a beauty product junkie... If it&#x27;s new, i&#x27;ve probably tried it. I have been religously using bare essentials for a year before I got roped into trying some benefit products. $145.00 dollars later, I left with all brand new makeup from this brand, and this is my favorite product yet! I have what you might call \\&quot;problem skin\\&quot;. Not horrible, but enough to warrant to usual girl hysterics that come with occassional pimples. This product makes your skin SO SOFT. It evened out all the redness on my face without all that makeup. One problem though... your face will be so soft, that keeping hands off it might be difficult! my boyfriend is always touching my face now.</li>
    <li> For coverage, this really doesn&#x27;t do anything for me.  It doesn&#x27;t stay on well as it can easily transfer to clothes, etc., with only the lightest touch to the face.  The consistency is a bit too creamy, although the make-up tends to leave a powdery look on the skin.  In terms of evening out the skin, like for those wishing to mask redness or discolorations in the skin, this product, in my opinion, is overpriced as it by no means, accomplishes this task.  It&#x27;s so sheer you can see right through it.  It makes you feel like putting more on to the areas you wish to conceal, but you can add more and more, and it still doesn&#x27;t hide anything, but rather, leaves you with a powdery oily layer on your face.  I don&#x27;t like it, but if you like the utra-sheer foundations, you may find it nice, but I like foundation to creat an overall even healthy appearance and I think I may need more coverage in certain areas.</li>
    <li> I am beyond dissopointed with this project.  I have fair skin and this is WAY to dark (in the light selection) I was so excited about it and now It was a total waste of money.</li>
    <li> Unless you already have flawless skin, Benefit&#x27;s Some Kind-a Gorgeous won&#x27;t do anything for you. Admittedly, I prefer a foundation that provides more coverage, but I received this product as a free sample and was surprised by how little it did for my skin. Benefit products generally rock the house, but not this one. It&#x27;s sheerer than any other foundation I&#x27;ve ever tried, and it has a super oily consistency. I applied an insane amount of this product to my face in hopes of seeing a noticeable difference, but I was very disappointed. The only thing that happened after shlopping on about 50 pounds of this stuff is that my face wasn&#x27;t shiny anymore, but that was it. It did nothing to even out my complexion, mask redness, etc. I still needed to apply a ton of powder afterwards. I don&#x27;t recommend this at all!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s summer and the weather is hot and muggy and your foundation feels like a suffocating, melty layer of goo on your face. That used to be me before I found Benefit&#x27;s Some Kind-A Gorgeous.   First of all, if you need a lot of coverage in a foundation, then this product probably is not for you. I&#x27;d say Some Kind-a Gorgeous gives you a fresh, natural, \\&quot;I still look like me, just better\\&quot; look.    The first time you apply Gorgeous you may have to do a double check to see if any product is actually on your face; it&#x27;s that sheer. I apply a few dabs of concealer on those less than pretty spots and then go for the Gorgeous.  It takes a few minutes after application for the product to change from dewy to a slightly matte texture which gives your complexion that nice \\&quot;soft-focus lens\\&quot; look. Unlike some other matte finish products I&#x27;ve tried, Some Kind-a Gorgeous stays soft looking and feeling, not like I applied a layer of dried mud to my face. \\&quot;I&#x27;m ready for my close-up, Mr. DeMille!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I like Benefit products so I did try this out at their counter. My main complaint is it feels very very heavy, and looks greasy. Basically it has no oil, but it made entirely with silicon, and boy do u feel and smell it.  Although it does blend well, it looks like I am wearing a base. I am over 25, and don&#x27;t like to looke like I am wearing makeup and I felt it was too heavy for daytime wear..inappropriate for work. Also it does not cover blemishes well. It is more for evening skin tone. I went to Sephora, and for my combination skin, they recommended clarins. I like it much better. Blends so that it is invisible and provides necessary cover for blemishes.</li>
    <li> I love this foundation.  It&#x27;s creamy and smooth and when applied, it doesn&#x27;t come on thick and cakey.  Although it comes in only 2(?) colours, the tint works on different shades of complexion.  I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> This product is extremely sheer, but that is because it ISN&#x27;T a foundation. it&#x27;s meant to give a sheer base for other make up. Hence the reason it is called \\&quot;the best foundation faker,\\&quot; or something to that extent. If you have acne I would strongly reccomend a different product. while I think it works pretty well, I feel like it doesn&#x27;t last very long. It seems like it come off of my face in a few hours, and if I&#x27;m going to pay $26 I expect it to stay on all day. However, it does leave my skin feeling soft. I don&#x27;t have oily skin at all, so that may be why i have never had a problem with it seeming to oily. I also think it runs out very quickly. Mine already has a large hole at the bottom of the tin, and i only got it 3 weeks ago, and I don&#x27;t use it every day. It is a decent product, but I don&#x27;t think you get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> I bought this product from all the great reviews. I knew it was going to be a light product with little coverage, but that&#x27;s what I wanted. What I didn&#x27;t want was an oily face. My face gets extremely shiny after fifteen minutes of wearing this. I do not recommend this product to anybody. Im sticking to my Bare escentuals, I don&#x27;t know why I even wanted to change brands.</li>
    <li> This is a very clever and very practical beauty product that you must try! It&#x27;s a foundation \\&quot;faker\\&quot; and it&#x27;s the easiest way you can look like you just put on some foundation! It&#x27;s not cakey or messy at all. It&#x27;s actually really, really sheer, therefore very natural-looking. This product has become a staple in my make-up routine already. It will suit all skin tones. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> If you are not trying to cover a ton of blemishes, this will work great for you.  Its heaven for my combo skin, and just evens everything out without being heavy.  Throw this on and you won&#x27;t feel it at all.  I also have somewhat sensitive skin that tends to break out with some foundations, but I&#x27;ve been using this for 6 months with no problems.  It&#x27;s also great to layer on top of You Rebel (benefit foundation) for more coverage.</li>
    <li> this is an awesome i have bad oily skin and breakouts have not have had a breakout since but has been only been using this for about a week and love it i also use it with Laura Gellar balance and brighten and they work gr8 together my make up would look so washes out by the end of the day but with this my skin made a BIG improvement by the end of the day and very little touch up with the balance and brighten. this is a gr8 investment and a must i highly recommend this weightless foundation</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t think I would like this product.  It looks too dark in the compact.  But you put it on, it feels so powdery sheer.  If you like Dr. Feelgood, you will love this.  It makes your face look finished, but not \\&quot;masky\\&quot;, like most liquid foundations.  This is going on my list of faves, right up there with Get Even and Benetint!</li>
    <li> Honestly, I don&#x27;t think that I would have bought this product alone due to its high price and my general aversion to foundations. I really don&#x27;t like the mask-like feeling one gets even with light foundations, so I generally skip it. I tried Some Kind-A Gorgeous on a fluke because it came bundled in a gift bag of other Benefit items and, frankly, it&#x27;s become a daily staple for me.     The coverage is pretty minimal--just enough to even out my blotchy spots and create a smooth finish for the rest of my makeup. When I&#x27;m finished smoothing it on in the morning, it doesn&#x27;t even really look like I&#x27;ve got a face full of makeup on. Instead, it just looks as if my skin has suddenly become clearer, smoother, and more dewy. And that kind of \\&quot;natural\\&quot; radiance (in my opinion) is certainly worth the price.    If you&#x27;re on the fence about this product, my advice is to just give it a try. I&#x27;m certainly glad that I did.</li>
    <li> This foundation faker in this set are PERFECT for any special occasion, wedding, prom, etc. as well as for daily use. As a loyal benefit client, I have found this to be my favorite product. Pair it with the Valley of The Stars Kit or the Realness of Concealness (if you would like/need more coverage) and you have a flawless and highlighted glow. As a frugal and minimalist makeup buyer, I can say that this is a MUST HAVE to even out your skin tone. IF YOU DESIRE MORE COVERAGE, PAIR WITH A CONCEALER SUCH AS BOI-ING #2,(the medium tone, what 85% of women wear) and you have a flawless canvas.  &lt;br /&gt;Essential benefit staples (what I wear daily) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Some Kind of Gorgeous &lt;br /&gt;Benetint stain for my lips and cheeks &lt;br /&gt;bad gal lash (eyelash thickener) and or get bent (eyelash curler and extender) &lt;br /&gt;The Valley Of the Stars kit (I mostly use the eyeshadows daily, the high and moon beam mixed on the weekends) &lt;br /&gt;If I use eyeliner, I use the Bad Gal eyeliner (since I am a klutz with eyeliner, and even I can wear this one! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then viola, you&#x27;re done! &lt;br /&gt;Rush hour, a new benefit product, is also a great one to check out if you&#x27;re looking for a cheek and lip color in one. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I tried this after reading some good reviews, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be THIS good!  It&#x27;s like Smashbox primer, Clinique pore minimizing instant perfector and a lovely sheer foundation all in one.  A little extra concealer tackles my discolored areas and I look airbrushed.  It even smooths over my chin and mouth areas, which are bothered by period cystic acne and blackheads.  I normally use 7-15 beauty products - with this, some good mascara, and a bit of lip/cheek stain, I felt gorgeous and polished!</li>
    <li> This gave my skin a nice texture and had good coverage for what I was looking for but....it settled into all of my fine lines and wrinkles and magnified them!</li>
    <li> I love Benefit makeup. I used to use Clinique religiously until I found Benefit at one of their makeup counters about two years ago. I used to have extremely pimple prone skin...key words are \\&quot;used to,\\&quot; because ever since switching to Benefit, I NEVER break out. I love Some Kind-A Gorgeous because I can&#x27;t even tell I am wearing it, unless I look at my face and see how radiant my skin looks! This foundation will not look like you&#x27;re wearing a mask...it blends wonderfully, covers all redness, and really gives me a healthy, dewy glow. Love it!</li>
    <li> I tried this foundation faker at a Benefit counter inside Macys and when I walked out of there I looked fresh, natural and pretty without the heaviness of regular liquid foundationm but I was skeptical. Even though my sister did not like this product due to the semi-transparency I have been searching for a new foundation to replace my BE minerals which has recently been disappointing me with cystic acne breakouts, parched overdry skin and enhancing pores and lines! After reading all of the reviews I gave it a shot and wanted to own this very cute compact, and I am glad that I did. Just like the first trial of this foundation faker, it glided on smoothly, felt light and looked fresh and natural. Maybe being a creamy foundation I had no issues with this product enhancing pores and lines. I am a satisfied Benefit customer and have owned a lot of their products over the past five years.I can easily use a cream or a powder blush with this foundation and both blend easily and looks gorgeous! It also pairs nicely with their industrial concealer Boi-ing which I have in #02. I start with a clean moisturized face and blend in Dr Feelgood in random areas on the face which have large pores, use Boi-ing #02 concealer on problem areas and blend the Gorgeous allover before I add my Stila convertible lip and cheek color in Lithium and Stila shadow eyeshadows. I cannot be happier these winter months as every product I use including Gorgeous are compatible with my skin! The only issues that I have is that the included sponge is kinda thin and I don&#x27;t see it lasting too long and the makeup pan appears to have little amount of product in it for the price but we will see it may last a few months which is fine for me. Yay!</li>
    <li> Great product!  I was so impressed.  It can feel a little sticky, but what I really like to do is to use it under a finishing powder.  It is very smooth and I am very impressed</li>
    <li> This is NOT a foundation product. If you&#x27;re looking for full or medium coverage, this will not deliver! However if you have generally smooth complexion perhaps with patches of redness due to allergy or dryness, this is for you. What this does is evens out skin tone, dulls the red patches to your original skin tone. Apply with sponge provided (fingers don&#x27;t do as good a job) and wait 1 minute, look into mirror and hey presto redness all gone. If you have acne or pimples, you should be using a concealer first before applying this because bumps are 3D. I have smooth dry sensitive skin prone to redness etc and this product covers so well I do not need to wear foundation over it, so have junked all my foundation products. I think this will not work on very fair nor very dark skin. If you are in between, like brunette or Asian, you should do fine.</li>
    <li> I would only recommend this foundation for a little girl to use as play makeup, but the price makes it completely not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are three things I don&#x27;t like about this product:&lt;br /&gt;1. Very little coverage that will not last but an hour, max.&lt;br /&gt;2. When I use it after my moisturizer it tends to flake on my face.&lt;br /&gt;3. It smells! Yuck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please invest your money in something else.</li>
