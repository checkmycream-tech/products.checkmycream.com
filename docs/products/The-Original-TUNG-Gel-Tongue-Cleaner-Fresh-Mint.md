<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is wonderful for getting rid of bad breath. It really works. The best product I have found for this purpose. You delivered it ahead of schedule. Much appreciate do.</li>
    <li> This product works so great! My mouth feels so much cleaner than just brushing my teeth.</li>
    <li> It truly works to mitigate bad breath!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> the tongue gel is awesome. I used it on my tongue and later it feels cleanse and minty. my mouth and tongue feels fresh. I love it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and super fast shipping !!! Thank you !!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what magic sauce is inside this tube, but it works. Enough said.</li>
    <li> THIS GEL IS GREAT IT DEF SEAKS THE PLAQUE FROM THE TONGUE AND WHEN I SCRAPE I SEE WHITE STUFF MOVING WHICH IS DISGUSTING BUT THATS HOW YOU KNOW THAT ITS WORKING.LOVE IT AND PLAN ON REORDERING REAL SOON.</li>
    <li> really helps with breath issues</li>
    <li> This is it!  Looking for fresh breath? Don&#x27;t skip brushing the tongue.  This gel does wonders getting the gunk off of your tongue.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed --</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had issues with my tongue for a long time.  My taste buds and papillae tend to grow longer than normal, allowing bacteria to hide and grow, and causing bad breath.  Normal toothbrushes are inadequate to properly clean my tongue, as they cannot reach as far back as I need.  Regular tongue scrapers also do not seem to do much for me.  So, when I first saw the Tung Brush and Tung Gel here on Amazon, I was a bit skeptical.  But not for long!  After trying this for a few days, I realized this thing works amazingly well.  The brush is the perfect size and shape to reach toward the back of the tongue without gagging.  The gel rinses off the tongue really well - better than normal toothpaste - and cleans well.  After a couple of weeks using the brush and gel, my tongue was looking better than ever, and my breath seemed fresher and cleaner (at least according to my wife and children).  Added to normal tooth brushing and flossing, it will go a long way to improving oral health - that has been my case for sure.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I still rate this item 4-stars, but Tung needs to work on the after taste of this product. Mouthwash will kill the taste a bit.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It cleans your tongue well. It works better than brushing your tongue with toothpaste. To me it cleanse your tongue better than toothpaste. All I can say is try this product, and see for yourself.</li>
    <li> The Tung Gel does exactly what it advertises-leaves your mouth feeling fresh and has a great taste. When used with [[ASIN:B00005BAWO TUNG Brush Tongue Cleaner]], it is the best product for oral hygiene that I&#x27;ve used so far. It looks like toothpaste, but works better! It gets rid of most strong odors. Obviously garlic and onion will linger, but this clears up way more than toothpaste, and if you follow with mouthwash, no one will ever know. Just stay on top of your oral hygiene and all will be grateful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the Tung Gel is a great product and I recommend it and the brush.</li>
    <li> This product was surprisingly impossible to find in several by me. I do feel so much fresher and can tell a difference when I supplement my brushing routine with this.</li>
    <li> I d suggest to use who are suffering from bad chronic breath. This product is worthwile. Bad breath is happened because of junk white stuff on the surface of tounge and this product fight with junk stuff. I &#x27;ve been using tung gel since six month. Give it a short and see the difference. Hope this help&lt;br /&gt;tcz</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful! It not only cleans your tongue but gives you fresh breath that lasts for hours. It has a nice taste too! But I noticed that it makes my voice a bit raspy and even caused me to wake up in the middle of the night. So I now only use it during the day. The raspy voice comes back every once in a while though.</li>
    <li> This is the only product that I know of that does what it does. And it works. Maybe you know that that yellowy coating on your tongue is caused by bacteria that then cause bad breath. For better breath, you&#x27;ve got to remove it. Scrapers can only do so much (and I still use one.) Tung Gel with the tongue brush works to remove that tongue coating. To be sure it was the gel and brush that were actually working, I tried regular toothpaste and a toothbrush. That didn&#x27;t work. I also tried the other combinations of Gel with a toothbrush, or toothpaste with the tongue brush, and those didn&#x27;t work either. Only the Tung Gel with the specifically designed tongue brush works. Thanks goodness I can get Tung Gel through Amazon - my local drug and department stores have stopped carrying it.</li>
    <li> I love the Tung brush -- since I purchased mine, I&#x27;ve used it every day -- WHAT A DIFFERENCE -- AMAZING!! But it&#x27;s not just the Tung brush that&#x27;s so great -- the gel is fantastic.  The taste is great - fresh, clean -- not pasty like toothpaste -- but SO refreshing.  I love my Tung brush and gel!!</li>
    <li> Used with the Orabrush, this product brings fighting bad breath up a notch.  Works well for me after onions and garlic for lunch before a meeting. Great when you really need to be sure you won&#x27;t have bad breath.</li>
    <li> The tung gels it&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> OMG!!!!! This product is the \\&quot;bomb\\&quot;!!! I love my \\&quot;bold\\&quot; coffee every morning to get me going...(2-3 cups of Joe)Then I brush my teeth and give the tongue a once over-not ever really getting rid of the bitter taste till about noon....BUT then I came across TUNG GEL product along with the low profile brush!!!!!!! WOW!!!!! GOod MoRnINg WOrlD!!!! Holy cow....my tongue is pink, fresh and very happy!!!! The flavor is minty fresh and the feeling lasts for hours!!!!! Have the makers thought about putting a rack by the counter in Starbucks??? IT would sell like hotcakes!! -I&#x27;m just saying..........try it, YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is super helpful.&lt;br /&gt;It gets rid of any nasty coating that might be on your tongue and tastes really nice and minty.&lt;br /&gt;I find it easier to put a dab on my finger and put it on my tongue directly, because if you put it on the tung brush most of the gel will just get between the bristles. I like this product for abating bad breath</li>
    <li> Works better than toothpaste.  Tastes good too, not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;I had gotten a sample of this when I got the Tung brush and now will not use anything else.&lt;br /&gt;FYI: The Tung brush works better than a tongue scraper or regular toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I am sure this is a great product but as everything in life, what works well for one person, may not for another.  I just do not see a difference from regular toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, it is my first time using and experiencing these type of gel products for cleaning/scraping&lt;br /&gt;my tongue, in the past I had been using regular tooth paste but it is not the same feeling, it seems like its more&lt;br /&gt;gentle on your tongue and I feel that after brushing my teeth with my toothpaste and then I brush my tongue with&lt;br /&gt;TUNG GEL, I feel like my whole mouth is cleaner and fresher than just brushing alone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> It cleans your mouth and it lasts for at least half a day! I didn&#x27;t have stank and stale breathe for a while after using this for a week but I ran out at one point and only used a tongue scraper and the stank and stale is back after about 6 hours of brushing my teeth along with mouth wash and such.</li>
    <li> this tung cleaner is the best stuff I have ever used to clean the germs and grim on my tongue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My  tongue looks fresh and pink.</li>
    <li> Can not honestly say if it working, but it does taste fresh, and easy to use, now if only I could get over the gag reflex it would work better.</li>
    <li> I like the flavor of the Gel however I do not notice much difference between it and using regular toothpaste to clean my tongue.</li>
    <li> Does a superior job of tongue freshening.  Use it with tong scraper.  I am a senior citizen female, however, I think this product would be popular with the men as it works quickly.  It would be convenient to carry when traveling.  It has a very pleasant taste too.  I haven&#x27;t seen this product in stores, however it&#x27;s very good.</li>
    <li> I have to say the Original Tung Gel is the best. My breath is not only fresher but mouth entire mouth feels better after using this gel along with my TUNG Brush.&lt;br /&gt;The only afer-taste I have is a clean and refreshed tongue, and confidence that my breath is the best it can be.&lt;br /&gt;Keep up the good work TUNG!!</li>
    <li> This product does what it says. It&#x27;s hard to find in retail stores, so I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s available on amazon. I like using this with a tongue scrubber much better than with a tongue scraper alone. I feel that this totally neutralizes my bad breath, and when used regularly my morning breath is not nearly what it could be!</li>
    <li> does not take off stain from coffee and tea as some reviews stated.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and she swears by it.</li>
    <li> I use this with the tung brush and it leaves your breath so fresh all day. I tried using he tung brush with a regular toothpaste, but it doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well.</li>
    <li> Great tung gel. Cleared up my tung in a minute. I am very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> great product.  works as advertised.</li>
    <li> works need to cost less will buy more as needed sent fast boxed well no damage buy 2 and save</li>
    <li> This is the best! I don&#x27;t know how else to describe how much FRESHER and CLEANER my mouth FEELS! Have to wonder-- how is it our whole teeth world seems like &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34;. Eh? IT IS A WHOLE MOUTH we live with and try and keep CLEAN. This product is very helpful on my quest.</li>
    <li> This product does the job and leaves the tongue feeling clean and fresh. The flavor is nice, and minty, if a little tangy.</li>
    <li> Effective in cleaning my tongue but believe me the smell of the Tung Gel is AWFUL. wish they could improve the product smell itself.</li>
    <li> As expected.  Will buy again.  Perfectly complements the cleaner I had. Nice fresh taste that lasts most of the day.</li>
    <li> I do like the taste of this and it does clean your tongue. I think it is worth the try</li>
    <li> Just another product with a different name to use a toothpaste. Just buy a tube of mint toothpaste would be the same.</li>
    <li> I really agree with all the other 5 star ratings. This item really helps to keep my mouth feeling much fresher.</li>
    <li> this stuff burned my tonsils</li>
    <li> I will buy this again. Gives a fresh breadth as and when you want it. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I read about this product and watched the You Tube piece. Sometimes a product actually meets what it is promoting. In this case I am very pleased to say it has done that precisely. I have suffered from bad breath despite brushing my teeth and going to the dentist to make sure I have no cavities. This product along with the tongue cleaner have rid me of the awkward feeling of having my son and wife at times offering me gum or simply telling me that I have bad breath.</li>
    <li> The Tung gel along with the Tung brush are the best method of cleaning/brushing your tongue out there. If done daily, I have found this method (in addition to brushing your teeth and flossing) to be extremely effective in maintaining a fresh tasting and smelling mouth. I have used this, since my own dentist gave me my initial brush many years ago. The gel is a must have, simply amazing. You may consider letting your general doctor know the condition of your tongue in the morning, in case it&#x27;s a sign of any other stomach or health issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has the best pricing and availability I have found so far. The product came quickly and sealed for freshness.</li>
    <li> I love this paste! I did not buy the TUNG brush but I bought an off brand with a brush and scraper. This works like a charm with it. I love using it and the flavor is spot on. It does not burn my tongue but cleans it to a gentle pink. My mouth feel so clean! I love it and will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> fine but mint toothpaste would work as well.  unless there&#x27;s some hidden secret ingredient I&#x27;m not aware of.  prolly won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> This is my fault for not doing more research prior to purchase, but I didn&#x27;t realize (and it wasn&#x27;t stated) that this product contained artificial sweeteners (saccharin). If you like having fresh-ish breath and a lingering taste of toxic chemicals on your tongue, definitely buy this product.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly. I will never be without this Tung Gel ever! If you are on the fence about ordering it, ORDER it already you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This product has Zinc!! Not stated anywhere on Amazon when I ordered it. There is concern about zinc, for example it&#x27;s been voluntarily banned from denture creams and nasal sprays (because it destroys sense of smell!). Threw it away</li>
    <li> It ws the first time I tryed it.  The taste ws good it cleaned my tongue and left a. Nice clean taste in my mouth.</li>
    <li> This is a great substance used with my tongue brush. Kept my tongue clean and fresh. Not much else to say</li>
    <li> Will not use it - it has methylparaben known like cancer cause ingredient.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Great taste.</li>
    <li> We both are hygienists and we were interested in what it would do. She says it gives her fresh breath daily.</li>
    <li> I thought it would give me something extra to cleaning my tongue but its okay. I was expecting more lather with more penetration in cleaning my tongue.</li>
    <li> really does taste good...and keeps your breath fresher for longer it seems....about to purchase my second tube, i highly recommend this product for anyone who like to keep their mouth feeling and tasting fresh...works better than just normal toothpaste for cleaning your tonuge</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been brushing my tongue with my toothbrush and whatever toothpaste is left after brushing for years.  I found this product (and the TUNG brush) and thought I&#x27;d give them a try.  They both seem to be very effective at scrubbing the tongue and getting it extra clean.  Even after brushing it with the toothbrush, the TUNG brush and gel seem to get a lot more gunk off what appears to be a fairly clean tongue!</li>
    <li> ships soon, it worked like a charm for first few days. I could feel the freshness, my taste buds changed.after a few days it didnt seem to make much difference.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get all the positive reviews here. I followed the instructions on the brush, and brushed my tongue twice a day as I brush my teeth. On the third tongue brushing, my tongue started bleeding. The brush is very harsh. This tung gel tastes nice in the beginning, but shortly after I am left with a metallic taste. If you&#x27;ve ever had zinc cough drops, then you know they leave your mouth tasting horrible and metallic, and this gel does the same thing.</li>
    <li> I have plenty of gel to use.  I learned that cleaning the tongue is important if you want to have fresh breath.  I am happy with the scent.  I will purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for the taste of the gel (not terrible though) but it seems to do its job neutralizing the unpleasant taste caused by stubborn bacteria which lingers in the mouth despite brushing, flossing and gargling. It works great along with Dr.Tung&#x27;s stainless steel tongue cleaner (scraper).</li>
    <li> I use a Tung brush so this goes with it.  This only adds to my morning oral health regiment.  I have seen great improvement in my general mouth care since using this product.</li>
    <li> I like the product. It really does work and it&#x27;s worth the purchase. I was skeptical at first but I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> This product really works. I had plaque build up on my tongue. Using this product with the Tung  Oral Brush my issue clearned withing a couple of weeks.  my breathe has never smelled so good.</li>
    <li> This is just great to use. Always allows you to avoid bad breath. I also use a foaming one from another manufacturere that works too.</li>
    <li> I use the Tung brush and with it the Tung Gel.  Being a product junkie, and being especially diligent with my teeth/mouth, I wouldn&#x27;t want to leave home without properly cleaning my whole mouth.  As a singer, model and former pageant girl, my mouth is really important in all that I do.  My mouth feels completely clean and fresh using the Tung gel (and brush), and I always want to look and feel my best.  If you watch reality singing competitions, you can usually tell if they have used a Tung brush -- take a look....it will make you want run out the store and get this product!  Keep it fresh, friends!</li>
    <li> I am using Tung gel and another tongue foam. Nice! We need to take care of the whole mouth, not only teeth.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this item to everyone, to try it... freshen my breath daily !!!&lt;br /&gt;loved it  loved it loved it</li>
    <li> This is a great product! Works very well. But only use it once a day because it can be very drying and cause sores if used more than once a day.</li>
    <li> This product is okay but I didn&#x27;t really see the difference between using it and just scraping my tongue with regular toothpaste like I usually do,</li>
    <li> Do yourself a favor...use toothpaste instead.</li>
    <li> Been using this for a while now and gets rid of morning breath very well, tongue is nice and fresh and leaves a nice after taste when finished using.</li>
    <li> Personally, I prefer more mint and less sweet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will try again b4 bed, but I seriously doubt that I would like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think using a gel tooth paste would achieve the same.</li>
    <li> At first I thought a special paste for the tongue was a good idea....but, for me anyway, turned out to be too much of a bother.  I&#x27;m certainly no Hygienist, but while my regular toothpaste is still in my mouth after brushing, I use the tongue scraper and then rinse.  Works for me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay but won&#x27;t reorder.</li>
    <li> Works okay doesn&#x27;t clean as well as I thought it would.</li>
    <li> When you get this in the mail, you get a nice size tube. You think to yourself, I paid 6 dollars for a tube of this size? What a deal? Does it work? Like magic. You use some and 3 weeks later, you realize half the tube is full of air. I didn&#x27;t pay 6 dollars for a little squirt. Furthermore, toothpaste? The thing you can buy at a dollar store works just as well as this. Save your money for something that&#x27;s worth the value.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and by far the most effective one among all the tongue cleaning products that I&#x27;ve purchased. Ever since I realized that my tongue was the reason of my bad breath, I spent a lot of money getting different products trying to keep my tongue clean throughout the day. I started carrying a water bottle to work and started drinking water every hour. This is the first gel based product that I&#x27;ve used apart from the different tongue brushes and scrappers. I purchased the gel with the TUNG brush which is from the same company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend using this after you&#x27;ve scarped your tongue with a regular metal or plastic tongue scraper. The TUNG brush is not meant to be used for a long time on your tongue. It&#x27;s more to spread the gel on your tongue than for scraping. Make sure you scrub your tongue lightly on your first use, the TUNG bursh may feel soft but can cut your tongue leaving you uneasy to do anything on it for a few days. I usually follow the instructions and scrap twice, on both side and a few times in the middle. The freshness remains for at least a couple of hours regardless of whether you eat afterwards (it makes more sense if you do it after you&#x27;ve had your meal, but I&#x27;m just lazy and do it in the morning before eating breakfast). Keeping you mouth hydrating keeps the minty feeling longer. I went with the safe choice of fresh mint to try out the product and haven&#x27;t been disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product to people who are also trying out different types of scrappers. The gel definitely makes the difference, until you find something that works even better.</li>
    <li> Hello, Everyone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a type of guy who reads almost every single review negative and positive and come up with a conclusion for myself. I also very heavily rely on the star rating. Anything 3 stars and below I&#x27;m very careful to order; anything 4/5 stars I still do my work but rely more on peoples reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived quickly, It helps loosen the gunk on your tongue that causes bad breath order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this defiantly.</li>
    <li> I love using this gel cleaner, makes my mouth feel  much more fresh.  I use it every morning after brushing my teeth.  Highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> See my review for the Tung brush that goes with this gel.  I don&#x27;t prefer this system at all.  Makes me gag something awful.</li>
    <li> This product is definitely good I will buy it again. It keeps my breath fresh and taste good in mouth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dr. Weider&#x27;s TUNG brush and gel for more than a decade, and I have always been satisfied with these products.  With Amazon Prime, I can save a few dollars by purchasing these items here instead of at my local drug store (usually, where I live, only Rite-Aid carries them).  The TUNG gel has a pleasant flavor and leaves me with fresh breath for about an hour, at least (or until I eat again or drink something other than water), although it tends to leave a somewhat bitter aftertaste.  To minimize this, after first brushing with the gel, rinse your mouth completely with water and then go back over your tongue several times with just the TUNG brush and some water, making sure there is no trace of gel on the brush this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s another tip:  To avoid gagging, the trick is to inhale or exhale (try both, as one method may work better than the other) the *entire time* you are brushing (or scraping) the back of your tongue.  Give it a shot!</li>
    <li> I was looking for tongue (foam/gel/etc) cleaning solutions for a while, so I bought everything I found at the moment on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s sad that you cannot get any tongue cleaning solution in local pharmacies. Thank you Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;This gel is the most effective one.</li>
    <li> not my favorite product but it does work.</li>
    <li> Makes the mouth really clean, but it doesn&#x27;t spread that well with the tongue brush. Overall it is a good product that helps reduce the bad breath.</li>
    <li> I use this with the Tung brush and it tastes great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this gel with the companion brush for several weeks and love it!!  It works really well, leaves your tongue clean and breath fresh, it&#x27;s part of my daily routine now and plan to buy more!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using TUNG products since 2005, and I am still convinced that the TUNG tongue brush &amp; tongue gel are the best products to cleaning the fiesty &amp; gunky germs that love to rest on our tongues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you also use this tongue gel with the [[ASIN:B00005BAWO The Original TUNG Brush - Tongue Cleaner with TUNG Gel Sample]]. The tongue brush does wonders and gently massages and scrapes off nasty germs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tongue gel is minty, fresh, and fairly tolerable. The consistency and smell of the gel keeps gagging minimal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The TUNG gel, combined with the TUNG brush does wonders and still is the best for tongue hygiene.</li>
    <li> This paste works well with the Tung Brush. It freshens breath and doesn&#x27;t leave a weird after taste. However, I could also attribute that to my regular toothbrush and toothpaste. Nonetheless, this product is good because \\&quot;it goes with\\&quot; the Tung Brush.</li>
    <li> Use this with the tongue scraper and relief happened within second application.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product. My mouth felt so fresh and clean. I will be a repeat customer!!!!!!</li>
