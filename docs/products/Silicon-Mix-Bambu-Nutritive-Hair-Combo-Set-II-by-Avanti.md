    <li> Shampoo smells delicious( hahaha wish i could eat it :-) gets my hair clean and leaves a very nice scent. The other products are good also. I don&#x27;t think I could have done a better job getting these products for this price and my hair has improved in texture and shine and length. Very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> Silicon Mix Bambu, the combo set is the best way to get maximum results from these products.  Each product, beginning with the shampoo, is superior.  The shampoo is rich and creamy and doesn&#x27;t strip your hair of all its nourishing oils.   The suds are tremendous, which means its full of sulfates, but if you&#x27;re looking into this line, sulfates isn&#x27;t your main concern.  Your hair will feel clean, smell fabulous and prepped for the ultimate conditioning  that will follow.    The conditioning treatment can be applied and left on for 3 to 5 minutes or leave it in longer.  I check for detangling results and moisture.  Does my hair feel silky and moisturized?  Does the comb glide through?  Yes, to both questions.  I adore the smell of this product.  It&#x27;s like a nice perfume.  LOVE the scent.  I rinse it out and then I apply more, prepping it for the leave-in.    On wet hair, the leave-in works as my curl creme.  With some of the conditioner left in, and application of the leave-in focusing on my ends, I get a beautiful, shiny set of well-defined curls that last a week.  On dry hair, the leave-in moisturizes and provides my hair with incredible shine.  Not to mention the scent!  I keep all three of these products in my rotation.  If they created a rinse and glosser, this set would be beauty heaven.  As it is, you&#x27;re getting an amazing value for amazing quality products.  Trust me, I have spent top $ on hair products that don&#x27;t measure up to what these do.</li>
    <li> excellent hair treatment and the smell is sooooooooooooooooooooooogod!!! recommend this product for hair tratment a lot excellent purchase and excellent seller</li>
    <li> This product makes my hair very soft and it doesn&#x27;t carry that chemical scent.</li>
    <li> this,is,a must have .. It had my natural 4c  soft as silk ..also virgin bundles are perfect after a treatment from this product</li>
    <li> Doesnt smell or work as good as the original silicon mix</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Great fragrance</li>
    <li> Okay, I just bought this on Friday and it was shipped the same day. I got it today, which is Monday. It smells absolutely wonderful out of the bottle. I just tried some on my hands and it leaves my hands soft and smelling divine. I will wash my hair today and come back to update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A month after-Update&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so I like the deep conditioner and the leave in conditioner a little better than the shampoo. I use this for my lace wigs and extensions and it does very well, but more than anything the smell that it leaves on your hair is totally worth the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the shampoo as a shower gel. I also condition my body with the deep conditioner. The smell that it leaves on my body, makes my husband go crazy. Yes!! Looks like I&#x27;ll be ordering this stuff every month.</li>
    <li> Awesome Product! Left my hair feeling moisturized and smelling good. Please do hesitate to purchase this. it really y works!</li>
    <li> Luv this product it does wonders for my hair I have been using it for 7yrs now I&#x27;m addicted and makes my hair grow look healthy shiny alive omg I just luv it ..</li>
    <li> This is just ok.  I havent noticed any additional shine from using it.  The shampoo is very,very thick. It has a strong smell but not offensive. it also has SLS but my hair didnt feel hair or stripped. The leave in had no real effect on my hair. I mean none.  The intense conditioner is full of mineral oil and silicone and I have removed products that have these from my stash.  Still since I spent the money, I decided to try it. My hair was not as shiny or as soft as I hoped it would be. It has protein in it and I really dont need another protein conditioner.  I am thinking of throwing this one out!</li>
    <li> I used this to revive some matted and tangled hair extensions and it worked. I love the leave in conditioner and it smells great. I haven&#x27;t tried it on my real hair yet</li>
    <li> This stuff is the truth!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My kids got back from camp with their hair feeling like sandpaper.  They were in the pool all week. I washed and conditioned their hair and added the moisturizer.  It&#x27;s been 3 days and their hair is still soft, manageable and tangle free.  I&#x27;ve since thrown out all the other products including Carol&#x27;s daughter products and a host of others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I saw a girl on Youtube using this product and I brought it . I have fallen in love with this product because it makes my hair soft , shiny and grows it . I will be back to buy it again . This does not leave my haircare routine . I loe it and willlsay it a million times . Its good for all hair types even black women</li>
    <li> Great product and Seller, I recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my aging struggling hair, but it hated it..my daughters hair on the otherhand loves this stuff! It has kepti it moisturized and it is growing..so I guess with everything else in life..theres no one size fits all. Four stars for her and one star minus for me. You have to find products that work specifically for you..btw my hair is short , natual and coarse and my daughter has shoulder length relaxed hair. Good Luck!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I love it and it really works. I will be repurchasing it once I run out.</li>
    <li> The shampoo is ok, but the conditioner and leave in work excellent for week!! I had no tangles or frizziness when using this product !! Definite weave saver!!!</li>
    <li> Smells really good &amp; worked ok for most of my clients hair texture.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love those products. They help my hair grow so fast. It is unbelievable. I can never run out of those.</li>
    <li> After a few days and a few uses I realized that I ordered the wrong product.  I should not have order the bamboo formula but the regular formula.  Nevertheless, it has a wonderful natural smell and does leave my hair soft.  I will be ordering the regular formula though.</li>
    <li> My hair has already improved...thank you thank you thank you thank you, In another month I might not recognize my hair it&#x27;s so nice..</li>
    <li> This product not only smells great I love how it works. I really makes my hair feel soft and re-nourished.</li>
    <li> So exited, can&#x27;t wait to try them all together.</li>
    <li> This prospect was recommended by a friend I tried it loved it its the best smell great leaves hair smooth soft and silky.</li>
    <li> Beautiful Hair after using these products.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great! And it makes my hair so soft and manageable. Absolutely love it</li>
    <li> I was hesitant after I ordered this as Murphy&#x27;s law goes, I read the reviews were for mainly African American hair. My hair is Irish/Italian~ &amp;#60;grins&amp;#62;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got it today, can I just say I have NEVER used a product that I&#x27;ve written a review on the first try. I always wait to make sure I &amp;#34;really do&amp;#34; love it. People rely on these reviews for their purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will go down the line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells great-- Love the Shampoo, it&#x27;s silky and didn&#x27;t require half the bottle to wash my hair!&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner, I don&#x27;t have enough words for this &amp;#34;Miracle&amp;#34; This stuff was/is amazing. I will never not have these products on hand. Bye bye brick and mortar stores for my hair products. My hair is soft and soooooooooooooo silky!!! I can&#x27;t believe it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The leave in conditioner is amazing as well. You use a TINY bit on your super dry parts of your hair. I would rec this to my enemy that is how amazing this product is!!!!!! Just one of those products you fall in love with instantly!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this product line. Leaves hair soft, easy to detangle,  with a great scent. Works well on natural hair. Will order again.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. My hair was soft and manageable after the first wash. This will be a must moving forward. I thought my hair was very tangled while combing only to see that maybe 8 strands of hair were in the comb. I&#x27;m growing my hair out again and this will help tremendously with less hair shedding.</li>
    <li> Love it live it. Great buy and it was ship safe. Had no problems with anything opening up. Just love it.</li>
    <li> leaves my hair soft and mangable with out drying hair out .less breakage  which is most important and it smells great.</li>
    <li> These products did a good job leaving my hair soft and more moisturized! Moreover, the smell is really good!</li>
    <li> Great product left my hair soft and shiny</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the shampoo. It is hard to lather on hair. The others two are nice.</li>
    <li> This product does work. It leaves my hair very soft and silky but I still have not been able to manage the hair breakage. I relax my hair about 2 to 3 times a year so I know it&#x27;s not that because I already asked and was told it was OK to do this. If anyone knows of any product that will stop the breakage and make my hair grow PLEASE let me know! Thanx!!</li>
    <li> Took my chance on purchasing this - people seemed to either love this or hate it.  These products actually made my hair dryer and worse to comb through so would not recommend them.</li>
    <li> Good product and fast delivery!</li>
    <li> The best hair product ever! Even my boyfriend notice i was not shedding like a dog anymoreeeeee...&lt;br /&gt;Love it i still use this product</li>
    <li> From someone who always had limp, thin hair, I can&#x27;t believe how wonderful my hair is now! It is manageable, thick and VERY strong! It is not breaking like it used to and this is after one application of using all three of the products. It also leaves your hair smelling so lovely!!!! After years of trying to find the right shampoo products, this is it and it is reasonably priced!</li>
    <li> I bought hair from ali exoress and as soon as I washed it the curls left but csme back after using the bambu nutritive hair.conditoner it was less frizzy and had more life to the hair</li>
    <li> Dear Sirs,   I am writing to let you know that unfortunately my order is not right.     I received \\&quot;AVANTI SILICON MIX, Hair Care,\\&quot;. However, I had ordered: BAMBOO NUTRITIVE HAIR SILICON MIX COMBO SET II     I would be very thankful if you could solve my problem once I need my BAMBOO NUTRITIVE HAIR SILICON MIX COMBO SET II     I hope you can solve my problem as soon as possible.     Truly yours,     Leila Walker</li>
    <li> Great 3 step hair care. I only use Silicon Mix. Shampoo is great because a little goes a long way. Clean fresh scent. I use the deep conditooner right after. I allow it to set under the shower cap for 30-45 min. After i rinse my hair feels much softer n more managable. I use the leave in right before i blow dry n i have noticed ALOT less breakage. The heat from the blowdryer definately adds more softness and silkyness and is easier to comb through. Even after I flat iron and style, my hair still smells wonderful and does not smell burnt and fried. I love this product soo much.</li>
    <li> Love the product. Sent some to my sister and niece. My hair is soft and bouncy without a&lt;br /&gt;Lot of heat.  My great niece is 7 years old with a gang of kinky hair. I think it will work wonders on her hair.  Thanks</li>
    <li> This product does what it says... helping to repair my much needed thirsty hair due to much bleach, and chlorine from the water park.. AWESOME</li>
    <li> It feels really soft as soon as you put the conditioner all my hair styles come out awesome I love this product and of course the recommendation would be for everyone and specially for dry damage hair</li>
    <li> I love my silicon mix Bambu!!!!</li>
    <li> The trio of these products added silky-soft and bouncy curls to my hair that lasted longer than similar products I&#x27;ve used in the past.  I highly recommend those with natural hair, braids, or hair with loose or deep curly hair extensions to use these items for long-lasting soft curly hair.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this for my children (who are Puerto Rican)...I have 1 with kinky, curly hair, 1 with fine hair &amp; 1 in between! So, I always try out the products before I use it on them to make sure it is of good quality (since I&#x27;m such a great mother heehee).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This...product...smells...AWESOME! The minute I opened it I could smell it&#x27;s lovely aroma. I washed my hair 1st - left me hair almost completely detangled, not matted like most shampoos do to my hair before I condition it. My hair was immediately softer!&lt;br /&gt;Then, I use the moisturizer and it made it feel clean &amp; soft, not greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BEST is the leave-in conditioner!!! I left it in and settle in my hair overnight...the next morning, the smell was STILL there! It lingers like a sweet perfume :) IT smoothed my hair out nicely!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say...I WILL be using this for my children, although, I&#x27;m very tempted to keep it for myself!</li>
    <li> i LOVE THIS PRODUCT MY HAIR FEELS SO SILKY THAT I RECOMMAND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I love everything about this product. From the smell right down to the way it leaves my hair feeling silky and smooth. The fact that it rejuvenated my Remy goddess weave is definitely a plus.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. The leave in is the best.</li>
    <li> To start, all of the products smell exactly the same.  There is a very soft smell to them.  Really hard to describe.  Whatever it is, it is lovely.  The shampoo has my hair clean and smelling lovely.  The conditioner is the best I have ever encountered and so is the leave in conditioner.  It is not oily, it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  Just nice.</li>
    <li> use it only on human or real hair due to it causes synthetic hair to tangle pretty badly. Overall the product smells good but it has such a strong lasting smell that after wash the hair it still smells like the product and the smell caused me to get irritated and naseous. I bought 2 sets and gave the other to my sister and she too would NOT buy this product again. Plus I never recieved the smallest bottle as pictured.</li>
    <li> At first I was on youtube and someone posted a video that it was good to bring you weave back to life (and it is). I decided to buy the whole set.. I&#x27;m not a fan of the shampoo it makes my hair feel stringy.. as far as the leave in and the  deep conditioner I highly recommend it .. it makes my hair feels so soft and the smell last in your hair for a while . I recently purchased some Peruvian virgin hair and it felt so dry and had no shine to it.. I put some of the deep condition on it and left it over night.. my weave looks, smells, and feels so nice and soft.</li>
    <li> leaves me hair feeling and looking amazing my hair was dry and damaged and when i started using it within 2 weeks i saw my hair was changing my hair is now very healthy</li>
    <li> These products make your hair super easy to comb. Hair is super smooth and conditioned and smellsoh sooo good. LUV IT!!!!</li>
    <li> Great product 2nd or 3rd time buying it. I will recommend to friends and family. My daughter loves it. It is the best</li>
    <li> Very light and mild scent.  It also gets the job done. I would surely purchase more in the near future.</li>
    <li> Overall I was very happy with the product. I think it made my hair stronger and more elastic. Don&#x27;t be afraid to use the leave-in after. It makes all the difference.</li>
    <li> This product is great!!!! It not only works wonders on natural and relaxed hair, it is even great on human hair weaves and wigs made of Remy Hair!  For shine, softness, bounce and tangle free hair, THIS is your product!</li>
    <li> The only thing I use in my hair now</li>
    <li> I go to the salon every week! I asked my hairdresser (more than once) to tell me where she gets my treatments from so I can buy it and bring it to the salon(less money I have to spend)she said I cant get it and blah, blah, blah!Well hah! I have it and love it to the point where I don&#x27;t need the salon unless I get a trim or color!Now I know why she wouldn&#x27;t let the secret out! My hair is silky, soft, and smells oh so lovely! I&#x27;m of mixed race and have thick long curly hair it lightens the weight of it and is the perfect product for me!</li>
    <li> Great product!  I simply love the leave-in conditioner!</li>
    <li> I just loved it! After use it for the first time I feel that my hair was already better! If you you have problems about dry hair I really recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> Very good no complaints</li>
    <li> this is the greatest thing for hair what else is there to say-buy it try it !!!!!!!!!!! awsome just awsome</li>
    <li> I love the silicon mix it works good i love it my hair be so shinny and bouncy its the best.</li>
    <li> I was sooo disappointed. I waited in excitement for this product. I&#x27;m currently transitioning and was told by a friend that this was an awesome products to ease the \\&quot;kinks\\&quot; that go along with the transitioning process. It totally stripped my hair (shampoo) and the deep conditioner and leave in conditioner didn&#x27;t moisturize my \\&quot;thirsty\\&quot; roots. Not giving up just yet on my natural journey. Still lkn for a hydrating and softening product.</li>
    <li> I love the conditioner. I overdid the quantity I used for the Leave-In Conditioner</li>
    <li> Love it on my hair gives my hair a good clean feeling. It gives my hair a lot of slip but I originally bought it for my weave, left it dry but love it on my hair and its a great deal</li>
    <li> Love this product for my natural 4a/b type hair. Makes it so soft and healthy looking.</li>
    <li> I use this product on my expensive human hair wigs and it works great.  If you really want to get out the serious tangles, first do a bleach/ammonia bath, then condition it with THIS product for a perfect look and feel of your wig.</li>
    <li> The product is great!!! I really loved it!&lt;br /&gt;Very good seller, they accomplished the shipping deadlines. I appreciated!!</li>
    <li> My hair is beautiful !!!</li>
    <li> I got the condition the first time from a hair stylist and paid $50 for the jar. It did wonders for my very long thick curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;When I ran out couldn&#x27;t find a conditioner that worked as well and decided to try Amazon. I found it for 1/2 the price&lt;br /&gt;with additional items. If you have curly, frizzy, thick hair this is the conditioner for you.</li>
    <li> It was a gift and was appreciated immensely.  Works beautifully.</li>
    <li> One star because I never got a chance to use it! It came busted open and leaking everywhere.</li>
