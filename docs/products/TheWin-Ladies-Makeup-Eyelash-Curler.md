<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love it. Saves me a lot of time in the morning.</li>
    <li> Luv these items...they help out so much</li>
    <li> Came in I think, Japanese.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m confused.&lt;br /&gt;What.</li>
    <li> I probably dont know how to use it, directions in chinese, but its my bad just wish I could read the directions..</li>
    <li> It does it&#x27;s job great</li>
    <li> It was used and had black glue all over it when I received it.  Does not hold eyelashes very well.  Unacceptable, but not worth me sending it back.  I just threw it away.</li>
    <li> did not come with glue. threw it out.</li>
    <li> Weird tool. It didn&#x27;t come with a single instruction.</li>
    <li> great to put on fake lashshes</li>
    <li> These were shipped exactly on time and the only issue I have with the shipping is that the boxes containing the lashes were stuffed into an envelope and arrived a little smushed (hence the subtraction of one star). The lashes themselves were in their proper places except for a few that had gotten loose and despite them probably being shipped that way, were not flattened at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the lashes~ I tried the natural looking lashes the other day, and they were perfect! I had to cut away the excess on the ends (which keep them in place in the box) and to hide the part that attaches to my eyelid, I just brushed some eyeshadow over it like it was a liner, and ta-dah! They were very easy to clean, and I figure I can get at least two or three more uses out the the pair I used. My boyfriend loves &#x27;em, but isn&#x27;t sure about the thick set I have. Personally, I&#x27;m excited to try them but I&#x27;m waiting for a special occasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gotta say it was SUCH A GOOD IDEA to buy these together instead of separate. I totally saved money on this purchase and I&#x27;ll probably buy from these guys again.</li>
    <li> Wow, I&#x27;m surprised. This holder is awesome. So much better than the cheap little plastic holders. I place the lash in the holder, apply glue, let it dry for a moment and then stick it right to my eye. It is a nice addition to my eyelash stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;Pamela. (Tampa, Fla.)</li>
    <li> I guess you get what you pay for. This was cheap but I was hoping it would work. Alas, it is too flimsy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s was  old ,look used  already I should of purchase it at sephora or any beauty supply store I was disappointed .</li>
    <li> Still getting a hang of it</li>
    <li> This product is the perfect eyelash applicator.  When I first started wearing false lashes, I had them put on professionally.  It seemed pretty easy to apply the lashes myself so I tried to put them on with a pair of tweezers and it took forever.  Before finally purchasing this product, I tried another eyelash applicator and I would still struggle with the application because the applicator didn&#x27;t have the proper bend in it.  I finally bought this item and I was able to apply both lashes in under a minute, without a huge mess.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The applicator really doesn&#x27;t help.. And as long as this takes to ship you&#x27;re really just better off try to find one in Walmart.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I wanted to wear fake lashes in my wedding,needless to say I wasn&#x27;t impressed so I went without them</li>
    <li> It didnt help me whatsoever and actually made a bigger mess than i usally do!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an interesting gadget. It may be only a 3 star but I&#x27;m clumsy and giving it the benefit of the doubt.it doesn&#x27;t come with any directions so I wasn&#x27;t sure what the curved white thing was for but I&#x27;m using it to apply the glue to the lashes. If I was more coordinated I&#x27;d have a better idea if this worked well. Right now it&#x27;s hit and miss in trying to get the lashes in the right place.</li>
    <li> crap, cheap crap. it even came apart when I opened it. It doent even close well so it wont hold the lashes.</li>
    <li> I read previous reviews on this but, since it was so cheap, I decided to give it a try.  What was I thinking?  It&#x27;s a total waste of money.  The soft rubber part does not even close tight.  What a junk.</li>
    <li> at first I didn&#x27;t think she was going to use those tools, but now when I see her dressing, she&#x27;s using those tools to help, and I have to admit she does look good with them on...</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping! I love how this product helped to make it easier for me to apply my false eyelashes. Will definitely recommend it to someone(like me!) that&#x27;s new to putting false eyelashes.</li>
    <li> I love this applicator. Putting my lashes on are so much easier. Im not making a big with the glue anymore.</li>
    <li> The price was good but I guess you get what you pay for. I was better off just using tweezers</li>
    <li> They are really hard to use I wish I would of passed on this unhelpful item. Maybe you will have better luck.</li>
    <li> this glue applicator &amp; clip i really like it.. it make the life soooo easy now i can apply the eyelash easily and it save my time</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t even know how someone could use this thing.  It doesn&#x27;t hold the lashes and I have no idea how one would get it to work better than  your plain fingers would.</li>
    <li> I was never able to apply lashes until i bought this. This is very accurate and helps me apply lashes in the blink of an eye</li>
    <li> This works okay, but I would always end up using my tweezer or my hands like I was used to before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ended up throwing the product away.&lt;br /&gt;**Shipping was efficient.</li>
    <li> This item is easy to use, it is better than other similar items i had bought in the past. I loved it a lot i couldn&#x27;t resist to let my friend try it for herself and she had also loved it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too complicated to use for false eyelashes, better off using your fingers or maybe a tweezer.</li>
    <li> okay the clear thing came with it and its kinda pointless. and the clip doesnt hang onto the eyelashed that great. i tried using it but it was just aggravating and of course i bought it bc it was cheap but its not worth using. nor the clear thing that came with it. i ended up just throwing it away.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as a handy device as expected. So be aware, and better not buy it. I won&#x27;t order it again.</li>
    <li> I gave it 3 stars for 2 reasons. One being that it took almost a whole month to get to me, the other being that the entire package was in Chinese and I was unable to figure out what the product was made of...which is something I want to know when it&#x27;s going near my eyes.</li>
    <li> Poor quality, don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
    <li> Not a good product, is all I can say.</li>
    <li> This tool is great if you wear false lashes. For me getting the lashes as close to the lash line is a bit trickly but, with this tool you will be able to get your lashes right at the lash line. I highly recommend this for your make up kit.</li>
    <li> I just got mine in last week, its terrible! applicator was dirty, with some mascara or eyeliner residue on it! The package had clearly been open and used. Don&#x27;t bother with this product!!!</li>
    <li> The glue applicator is a great idea. It makes applying glue so much easier. All you do it apply the glue to the well, then dip the lash in and,  presto, your falsies have a nice layer of glue on them to apply with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never use the blue applicator clip, because I find the traditional way much easier. The clear glue applicator makes up for it, and it saves time when applying falsies.</li>
    <li> I got hooked with false eyelashes when I went out of curiosity and had some put on... LOVED then and was instantly hooked.. The problem, it cost 30.00 and they fell off after two day.. Boy what a rip off.. But I couldn&#x27;t get past how much I loved how they  looked... So I bought some.. Oh boy.. Not easy.. In fact very hard to get them on.. How can something that looks so easy be so hard to do...well I wasn&#x27;t giving up...I worked and worked to master it.. There was days I did but most I didn&#x27;t... I would work for hours trying to master the lash fetish... I really never got the natural look.. Glue all over my lids and when i would try and clean it off i woukd tear the lashes off...omg how freaking hard can putting lashes on be..THEN this tool popped up while I was shoping for more lashes.. I read the reviews.. Mostly good some bad but I didn&#x27;t care.. I thought it certainly won&#x27;t hurt.. So I got it.. Not good for me.. I wasn&#x27;t surprised but disappointed.. After a week I decided to try it again... I took the tool and put the lash between the lips of the tool almost down to lashes...I use Duo dark glue along the lash roots waited 30-45 seconds laid the lash on the middle of my natural lashes for about 30 seconds.. I removed the tool and pressed the ends down with my fingers and wow I have lashes.. I could not believe it.. Just like that I had lashes.. In less than a minute both eyes were done and girls... NO GLUE mess... I was so happy I almost cried.. Months and hous of struggles to apply eyelashes and now I can have the look I want in minutes.. That means girls that your lashes can b removed every night and applied fresh everyday..... So go right now and get this tool or one like it.. It&#x27;s amazing.. Don&#x27;t get frustrated if it doesn&#x27;t work the first or second time.. It will!!!!</li>
    <li> plain and simple, IT DOSENT WORK . DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY. ITS NOW IN THE TRASH, where it belongs ... no good</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t wear lashes all the time or if you wear glasses and have trouble aiming lashes at your eyelid, this thinga-ma-bob is for you! Then there&#x27;s the curved glue well, (draw a line of glue on the curve, dip the lash and POW the glue is on the lash).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, blow the glue on the lash to accelerate the drying effect then, using your thinga-ma-bob zoom in on your eye lid, hold it for 60 seconds, squeeze and release.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll need these instructions because wherever they ship from Hong Kong or wherever, there&#x27;s no English translation.  :-)  Good luck</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like, the instruction, r not n English, so I didn&#x27;t know how to put them on, also, it was cheap, so no hard feeling, but I would no recommended this to noone</li>
    <li> Exactly I  expected,  easy  to  use.  Prompt  on getting to me. a  better  set of  directions would  have  been  helpful.  the  product is simple enough though it&#x27;s easy to figure out.</li>
    <li> I found this helpful when applying fake eyelashes during burning man.  But I ended up using my friend&#x27;s applicator more since hers was even easier to use than this one.  Hers looked like a pair of tweezers but had a half circled rubber piece on the end.  That was super helpful when trying to get those tricky corners.  Although the glue stand is amazing, no more trying to apply the glue right to the eyelashes and accidentally messing them up.</li>
    <li> Its an ok product, its kind of does its job but its a little difficult to use. On the upside it was really cheap and it does clean up well if you happen to get glue on it. But I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend this, its actually easier to just do it your self. Good idea, just executed poorly.</li>
    <li> dont waste you money! hated the product. couldnt even read the directions. such a waste of money even if its cheap.</li>
    <li> I AM STILL LEARNING HOW TO APPLY THE FAKE EYELASHES. I DO RECOMMEND IT, BUT I AM NOT AN EXPERT YET ON APPLYING THE EYELASHES. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO PEOPLE THAT WOULD LIKE TO TRY IT.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not very good at puttin my left eyelash on using my right hand... my touch is to light because my vision is blocked.  This tool has given me the little bit extra room to see and feel more confident puttin my eyelashes on.  It is really light and holds the eyelashes without damage!  It also makes putting the glue on waaay easier!</li>
    <li> I have never worn fake eyelashes simply because ive never been able to put them on and this thinky-majig is AMAZING!!! I LOVE IT ♥♥♥♥♥</li>
    <li> It finished in my trash. Dirty, already used... It&#x27;s the worst thing I ever bought online. Do not buy it ! It is waisting your money no metter how much</li>
    <li> waste of money. I guess it worked but I still had to use my fingers to tweek the lashes to get them to sit correctly on my lash line.</li>
    <li> it is very helpful product but I was disappointed that it didn&#x27;t come with glue. now I have to buy glue</li>
    <li> it got here not so long ago but It is way to big for my eyes so its not as easy to let lash go</li>
    <li> this things is so freaking helpful. I didn&#x27;t know  how to put eye lashes on until I bought this and now I feel like a pro. a def must have</li>
    <li> The writing on the package is not in english,very hard to understand how to use this tool.I would suggest that you not purchase the product.</li>
    <li> Never seen such a tool before so thought it might be nice. Really didn&#x27;t work. Glue missing. Disappointed. Probably cost more to return than to just suck it up as a lesson learned :(</li>
    <li> Took a while to get here, but before the estimated date. It works okay. I can&#x27;t figure out how to put the eyelash on anyway lol in sure its better for people who wear them all the time.</li>
    <li> make putting on lashes easier</li>
    <li> Love this it helps me a lot get my lashes on it did not come with any thing to tell u how to use it but it&#x27;s not that hard to work great price did take a long time to come but worth it</li>
    <li> save your money its a waste of time just waiting on this lil thing it came in the mail and I was like wtf is this omg I will put it in the trash eventually</li>
    <li> maybe it&#x27;s me i dont know but it doesnt work for me. I liked the idea and was excited to get it but it does not help me apply the lashes.</li>
    <li> I really thought I was getting eyelash glue with this.</li>
    <li> It was useful , and it was Okays.</li>
    <li> Its a good product for its price. It makes the strip lashes easier to hold without getting glue onto your fingers.</li>
    <li> The price is right, it does it&#x27;s job. I didn&#x27;t even know something like this existed until I found it on Amazon.  I personally had a really hard time putting fake lashes on, and this makes is so easy!</li>
    <li> i hated this product simply because it claims to help apply your fake lashes and it does not you can as easily just use a pair of tweezers.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like I wait soothing better I dk how used no have intrution for see how I nedd used</li>
    <li> got the used one and very old with no bag . nothing label. will never use it and just useless.</li>
    <li> Says it comes with glue but doesn&#x27;t. Very cheap quality.  Took so long to get to my house. Like 4 weeks.</li>
    <li> pretty bad quality, really a waiste of a couple bucks. Might as well go to walmart and pay $3 for the ELF version PLUSS it comes with a pair of lashes.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work well. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. It was delivered in good conditions. You received what you pay don&#x27;t expect more.</li>
    <li> The thing was broke when I got it I am so easy to please and have never gave a bad review. But I waited so long for it to be broke.</li>
    <li> It was not what I was expecting... I bought a new product, but when the product arrived at my address it looked like used and a little bit dirty... I&#x27;m disappointed!</li>
    <li> If you have a hard time putting lashes on, you need this. I don&#x27;t think I could get them on without it. Handy tool, and super easy to use.</li>
    <li> Not all that its still a challeged for a person that can not put on fake lashes and the clip did not make it that much easier.</li>
    <li> When I received the item and opened it up it looked dirty, the tip of the applier had black spots on it like it was used already.</li>
    <li> I use this gadget every time I apply my lashes. After I apply the glue to the lash, I will put the lash in the clip to dry. The clip is the only one I use. I have become a pro putting fake lashes on. People are always asking me how I did it. Basically, I&#x27;m self taught through YouTube videos. I think the clip helps out a lot though.</li>
    <li> I have always has a diff time putting on lashes. I&#x27;ve tried all the tools including tweezers and this helps me get them on very quickly prob saves me about 10 mins.</li>
    <li> This product is the same as shown in picture. Very easy to use, simple. I love it. It&#x27; s Very good to gift!</li>
    <li> my clip arrived broken and nonfunctional; it was just one side of the blue clip picture!, what a waste of my time and money</li>
    <li> I struggle with placing my own lashes although I am a makeup artist. Mostly because my hand gets in the way. As soon as I got this I tried it out and it lessened my application time and I can see where I am placing the lash!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m better off using my fingers and hands... isn&#x27;t really useful. It was only one dollar though so not a huge deal.</li>
    <li> If this was in English I can comprehend I tried using it no hope but hopefully I will come across one in English.</li>
    <li> Very neat little tool!  It makes it super easy to put on your fake lashes! I love it! the glue tray is cool as well, it keeps the glue off your hands and distributes the glue evenly across the lashes!</li>
    <li> Shoddy quality to begin with, cheaply made, arrived broken. Not worth the cost in shipping to return, but I was not satisfied.</li>
    <li> I like the blue holder to hold you&#x27;re eyelash and applying the glue.  I&#x27;m still terrible at getting these darn things on so this helps me a little.</li>
    <li> love it, been waiting for it to arrive. I have been looking for onr like this for quite sometime. thanks</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried to use this when putting on eye lashes yet.  I don&#x27;t have a steady hand but I found that applying my eye lashes are easier done using tweezers.</li>
    <li> the rubber ends on one came off too easy but it is ok according to my gf very easy to use</li>
    <li> I learned how to use the product online since there were no instructions, but over all I am happy with the product.</li>
    <li> glue works great as long as you let it sit so it is tacky, i wasn&#x27;t coordinated ot use the plastic clip applictor.</li>
    <li> This is garbage..no directions.</li>
    <li> These are great if you have a hard time putting false eyelashes on. they have really helped me out getting my eyelashes on faster and hassle free.</li>
    <li> Very easy to apply specially for the people that don&#x27;t have much experience with lashes... This makes it waaay easier than the average tweezer!</li>
    <li> I rarely give products poor reviews, but I&#x27;d advise skipping it.  On the upside, it wasn&#x27;t very expensive, but I&#x27;ve had mine a year and I still haven&#x27;t figured out how it helps. I am a fairly novice false eyelash user, and this product was positioned as helping someone like me.  It includes a few cryptic illustrations, but the instructions are in Chinese.  Unlike other reviewers, mine arrived clean and in good condition, but as a tool it&#x27;s large and seemed to make the process more clumsy.  It didn&#x27;t help me at all.</li>
    <li> I actually threw it away because it was dirty inside the packaging, I could see it through the plastic, I never used it.</li>
    <li> This is great fits really well in hand and makes applying eyelashes easy I will definitely be buying more real soon</li>
    <li> Fast shipping ! I love it !</li>
    <li> I learned how to put on eyelashes because of this! Thanks</li>
    <li> its actually quite helpful for ppl like me who suck at everything beauty ..</li>
    <li> The item looks like a good idea, will make it easier to put on the eyelashes. Unfortunately, it doesn;t help at all. The clip cant even hold on to the very thin eyelashes and I cant get the eyelashes to stay in the applicator. It keeps sliding off.</li>
    <li> It really works. I can apply my own lashes just like professionals.</li>
    <li> if I didn&#x27;t have to leave the star to write a review I would fellas part first day of you does not make them work easy at all. Stick to tweezers save your money and why wait a month</li>
    <li> I never could get my eye lashes to go on till I received this its verry helpfull</li>
    <li> This came in not so foot conditions. It was brand new but its packaging was a lil dirty. I use it even thought because it was sealed in &amp; it works fine.</li>
    <li> Okay. I give it 3 stars because it is just so cheap. I also have absolutely no idea how to use it because it&#x27;s not in English. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> The applicator  is the quality of an item that would come out of a gumball machine.&lt;br /&gt;Glue applicator does not work</li>
    <li> Crap, but I shouldve known for the cheap price. It does not help me apply the eyelashes at all. Doesn&#x27;t do a thing. I threw it away immediately</li>
    <li> For those struggling putting falsies this is a &amp;#34;must to have&amp;#34; product. Quality is good and you have perfect control during the application of the lashes. I recommend this product, arrived on time.</li>
    <li> It was nice in the beginning when I got it but it just fell from my hand to the floor and it broke.</li>
    <li> Pointless tool.  Do not order  Used maybe twice.  Cheap plastic and took awhile to ship</li>
    <li> very easy to use....much better than the little white plastic that is sold with the lashes...love love love...would recommend to a friend</li>
    <li> Your better off using your tweezers ladies. I tried &amp; tried to use this &amp; really,it doesn&#x27;t WORK. If you want it for the sake of having it cause its a novelty then go for it. I would not recommend this.</li>
    <li> This didnt work at all.</li>
    <li> I got what I paid for. Cheap and plastic but does the trick. Especially have you have a hard time applying eyelashes.</li>
    <li> The clip was all you need the other piece was unnecessary .  curves lashes for you with clip excellent .</li>
    <li> I really did not know if my grqnddaughter would like this or not. I will see her in a couple weeks. I will ask her about it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good bit small and something you could carry around with you n use at anytime great product will purchase aqain if anything</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s kind of adorable but it doesn&#x27;t come with glue or instructions. I have no clue what the little clear part is for? It really doesnt make sense. But fast shipping, Thanks.</li>
    <li> very cheap, looks used in the sense that it looks old, not dirty. Like its been in someones makeup box. Not complaining paid a $1 or less and got free shipping.</li>
    <li> Great for putting on lashes it made it very easy to use will continue looking for new things to come</li>
    <li> Very cheap made would not be buying again</li>
    <li> poor thing is not good at all</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product, I like it and it really work! It make putting on eyelashes easy and save time.</li>
    <li> The spring in this is a bit sticky so that ruins the effective placement of the lashes.</li>
    <li> dnt buy this . waste of money and doesnt work... use tweezers instead. ok for the cost but dnt buy</li>
    <li> Makes things so much easier!</li>
    <li> Not the easiest to use until you get used to it.  Then it does the trick and helps to keep the glue off your fingers.</li>
    <li> I would never recommend this to my friend which we are false lashes freaks LOL. i received a DIRTY USED eyelashes holder! the back was torned up. it was dirty and sticky its like its been used for how many times. this is so not good. you guys are scammers. dont buy this pls i tell you all that 5 star review its their review not anybody who bought this. they just want us to see d good side of this product but its not. its so disappointing like BIGTIME! DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> This was poorly made and came broken can&#x27;t complain the price was under two dollars.</li>
    <li> Found this very useful wouldn&#x27;t go without it</li>
    <li> The product works alright, but if I had paid attention and realized that it had to be shipped from overseas I would have picked something shipped from the United States. It arrived before promised, but still took longer than if it was shipped from the states.</li>
    <li> I know it was a super cheap product, but it arrived and it was used and dirty! I would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> this is awesome for the price, so easy to put on my eye lashes and simple, thank you so much</li>
    <li> Once I received the item it was in a dirty package that had been obviously opened and taped back up.  When I took the item out of the package it was dirty and inside the clamp had black makeup smeared inside.  I don&#x27;t even want to touch this thing with my bare hands much less put it near my eye for fear of hygiene issues since I can only imagine how many times and where this thing has been used.</li>
    <li> Made application time faster and easy. Instead of the usual 30 mins messing around took seconds and turned out better with this handy tool.</li>
    <li> not ideal for application, however you can place it on while placing glue on lashes but it does not release the lashes for application</li>
    <li> This item is made cheaply and confusing to understand how to use. All directions are not in English. I would not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> This is a fairly good product&lt;br /&gt;how ever the I feel that when I recieved&lt;br /&gt;the product that it had been some what used&lt;br /&gt;already even though I took it out of the&lt;br /&gt;package it just looked worn but other then&lt;br /&gt;that I think it&#x27;s served it&#x27;s purpose well</li>
    <li> Everything is in Chinese.&lt;br /&gt;The gf said that it didn&#x27;t matter because she has used something like it before.&lt;br /&gt;If you dont know Chinese then this might be useless to you.&lt;br /&gt;my original review gave this a 5 but i saw all the reviews about how it looked used so i cleaned it for my gf and it fell apart.&lt;br /&gt;only thing i did was put some rubbing alcohol on it and it feel apart.&lt;br /&gt;i have never seen something like that happen before.</li>
    <li> I order these over a month ago and have not received my package till tis day and it was supposed to arrive on the 1st n today is the 6th</li>
    <li> Love love love this product</li>
    <li> love this product, its awesum and makes putting eyelashes an easy task. couldnt be more happy and satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> love this product. All girls should have one!</li>
    <li> This application works great it really helps me to apply my false lashes. I am so glad I ordered this item.</li>
    <li> I tried using this thing but it just didn&#x27;t work right.  A pair of tweezers worked better.  Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> I ordered this and it was used looking and dirty I mean the package fell right off it like it was already opened and had an oil stain in the middle of it as if from dirty greasey fingers</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care for this product, its easier to control the eyelashes yourself. Also the glue strip doesn&#x27;t really work well.</li>
    <li> Could not get the directions translated! Had to look up how to use on YouTube and it is not easy to use at all. Although, if you can figure out how to use it well, the price is much cheaper than in Sally&#x27;s beauty Supply or others.</li>
    <li> Too small, don&#x27;t have a good grip. It&#x27;s a waste of money.  It will end up in a draw somewhere, and forgotten.</li>
    <li> It is very easy to use! My friends all loved it and compared to other similar products. Would definitely recommend</li>
    <li> I still don&#x27;t know how this works. By the time I put the adhesive and try to put the lashes I  find myself struggling to find the fit on my eyes and the lashes would be anywhere but where intended lol... Much easier to do it the old fashion way</li>
    <li> It is in usable state when sent to me. So far i have not try to use it to put my falsie. Dont look very durable to me. Look fragile. Anyway it is ultra cheap so i cant complain much!</li>
    <li> this product was at a great price, works great, my daughter loves it and uses it frequently for her eyelashes.</li>
    <li> Cheap but awkward to use</li>
    <li> I do not wear false lashes because the ate too hard to put on. I saw this and decided to give it a try.  It works!</li>
    <li> Not a necessary tool. And instructions are in a foreign language.</li>
    <li> this is a nice tool for putting on lashes quickly.</li>
    <li> i use this for first time and it was pretty easy to apply my false lashes hands free. i love it.</li>
    <li> when i want to put my lash on my eye lid, always fall....it just doesn&#x27;t work not even hold the lash</li>
    <li> Takes some getting use to using, but is easy to use.</li>
    <li> Not very easy to use.  :(</li>
    <li> These eyelashes were the most horrible lashes I have bought. They weren&#x27;t even able to be attached. I would not purchase these.</li>
    <li> Cute and useful. But a bit bulky. Wouldn&#x27;t repurchase it.</li>
    <li> The clip works well but the glue applicator is pretty pointless.</li>
    <li> This little gadget is a must have if you wear false lashes.  You are able to apply your lashes more professionally with this applicator.</li>
    <li> This is the first product that I have ever given a poor review. It took a long time to receive it, and the product looked&lt;br /&gt;Like it was used!! It was dirty the instructions was very poor. It was all in Chinese no English! At least you could have put a note in the package in English on how to use it &amp; not to pass off a USED product for NEW!&lt;br /&gt;I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> This thing does not work at all, I have no idea how to get it to even work half way, waist of money. It was a good idea at the time.</li>
    <li> Product more wonderful&lt;br /&gt;Product beyond description&lt;br /&gt;I advise everyone Bsthaddamh Genuine First, because he was sure of it personally&lt;br /&gt;I am very wonderful wonderful performance&lt;br /&gt;I loved this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using fake eyelashes since I was a teenager for special events or the occasional Vegas trip (now that I&#x27;m older). This thing is so awkward. It&#x27;s much easier to use my fingers and tweezers. If you&#x27;re able to master this product, you are a ninja in my book.</li>
    <li> i am having a problem with figuring out what the clear half rounded rubber thing is or what it is for..as far as the eyelash holder..i love it!!!!</li>
    <li> This product had been opened and possibly used when I got it. There was dirt and dust inside the packaging. DO NOT ORDER THIS!</li>
    <li> Not as easy to use as i expected.</li>
    <li> It was nicely made just not very good at using it I guess , I think I had glue that wasn&#x27;t so good</li>
    <li> I was very unhappy with tis product as it did not work for me!! Also I was told I would be receiving it on a certain day and it was received a WEEK LATE!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t even get the glue.... AND THATS THE ONLY REASON I BOUGHT THIS ITEM!!!!! I will not buy from this seller again. I should have just bought some from the store. Guess I learned the hard way and you really do get what you pay for!!!!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t come with no glue all it had was the blue piece that holds your eyelash to be placed on your eye .</li>
    <li> Did not come with the glue. I am a virgin to wearing lashes, have to figure it out. Although I haven&#x27;t worn them yet they look very pretty.</li>
    <li> This product was awful! When I received it in mail I could tell instantly that it had already been opened before! You could just tell that someone had used it and then close it back up to mail it out again! Even nastier than that it was used! Gross huh! I know it was cheap but that isn&#x27;t even worth a penny! I will never buy from this company again for any price. Watch out all you don&#x27;t want to put something nasty near your eyes!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really understand how it was supposed to work maybe it was just me but thank goodness it wasn&#x27;t expensive so I didn&#x27;t really waste my money</li>
    <li> Poor quality.  I ordered 2 and both do not close all the way with a partial slit, so it does not hold on to the lashes firmly.  May be I don&#x27;t know how to use it.</li>
    <li> Havent tried using the item as of yet but its seems simple enough. The clear piece holds the lashes while the blue helps to put them on.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work very well</li>
    <li> Didnt work for me .. didnt know how to use it..</li>
    <li> Grip for lashes is awesome, easy to apply and doesnt stick when taking applicator away from eyelid and lash. Holds the perfect amount of glue for application.</li>
    <li> I love it..now im waiting to receive my eyelashes..the price was worth the 3 week waiting period since it would be twice as much as the department stores..</li>
    <li> I really only do product reviews when I feel strongly about a product, be it good or bad and this one is definitely good. This one is a must-have if you wear false lashes.  I sure could have used this so many times in the past when I&#x27;ve applied my lashes only to end with my eyes tearing up because I&#x27;ve applied them a little off and my eyes get irritated and of course the lashes even looks a little off &gt;:\ .  This tool is so useful, so helpful, so convenient and really does take the guesswork out.  I can&#x27;t say enough what a miracle this little tool is, yes yes and yes get it!</li>
    <li> For some reason I thought it came with glue, guess I read it wrong. The Clip came somewhat worn out or peeling off. But other than that they work like a charm</li>
    <li> I like comfortable silicone feeling stuff makes its very comfortable. at first I didn&#x27;t know what the lil clear thing was and found out it was for applying the glue to the eye lash great!</li>
    <li> I got this thinking it would be more helpful in applying false eyelashes, However i was wrong. First of the it&#x27;s hard to grab the eyelash and fit it in the holder, and second if you do, it bends the eyelashes and ruins the shape</li>
    <li> I just started to try wearing false eyelashes. These took a LONG time to arrive. The eyelashes and glue arrived much quicker so I went to YouTube to learn how to apply. When these arrived I thought it would make the process of applying lashes somewhat easier. I thought wrong. When I tried to use these I ended up with black glue on my eyelids. I probably just need more practice. For me the applicator didn&#x27;t just automatically make it easier to apply the lashes, yet.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because it seemed like ot would make applying lashes easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself came in perfect shape and was a bit bigger than i expected. My only issue was that it didn&#x27;t come with instructions of any kind. For someone like me who didn&#x27;t know how to apply that was a suck moment,  BUT there are plenty of YouTube tutorials.</li>
    <li> This little gadget makes it easier to place the glue on the false eyelash without making a sticky mess. If you are having trouble with gluing your eyelashes, this is the tool to use.</li>
    <li> Siempre que usaba pestañas postizas padecía colocándomelas, con esta especie de pinza el trabajo es mucho más sencillo, además trae un accesorio que sirve para colocarles la goma sin que se deformen o pierdan los pelitos. Estoy muy satisfecha con la compra porque definitivamente es muy práctico y además económico. Se los recomiendo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Always wearing false eyelashes colocándomelas suffering with this kind of work clamp is much simpler, and brings an accessory that serves to place them gum without deforming or losing the hairs. I am very satisfied with the purchase because it is definitely very practical and economical as well. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> works like a charm, at this price i ordered a second after using the first one for just over a week. i dont use the glue applicator bc i just apply it directly to the lash while its in the clip and i think thats easier.</li>
    <li> I was&#x27;t where I spect I think was to put you eyelashes easy and the Not at all was hart to put my eyelashes whit this</li>
    <li> its ok, nothing spectacular. for first time users that do not want to spend a lot of money, this is for you.</li>
    <li> i BOUGHT THIS AND IT WAS WARPED AND DIDNT EVEN HOLD THE LASHES. i WOULD NEVER BUY ANYTHING LIKE THIS AGAIN</li>
    <li> First off i ordered this on the  feb 11th and i said i wouldn&#x27;t get it till march 10th but it actually got here feb the 21st so that was awesome!!! Since i was reading all the horrible reviews on this thing i was like ugh thinking its not gonna work so i ordered something else like this for back up but i just tried this thing and it works great and im just learning how to do lashes. So long story short dont be discouraged by all the bad reviews because mine came in a timely manner and it came in new condition and is works amazing im hopeful now i can include lashes to my daily makeup routine!</li>
    <li> I will finally be able to apply my artificial eye lashes properly. I&#x27;ve been using me hands and let me tell you, they don&#x27;t work. Thanks for having this available. !</li>
    <li> This is a great tool to have when you are new trying to wear false eyelashes.  Practice Practice is what I&#x27;m telling myself.</li>
    <li> Ive owned one of these before but was stolen in beauty school:( i love this little gadget! i have super short curly lashes so applying lashes with my hands are a pain this thing works wonders and is very easy to use. its basically common sense.lol i ordered on 1/24/15 and recieved it 2/9/15 im pleased and impressed being it came from hong kong:)</li>
    <li> Lash applicator...that&#x27;s what it is. Nothing good, nothing bad; did arrive ahead of time so that&#x27;s a plus since it was from China.</li>
    <li> It works perfectly. When I would just use the applicator, it helped me put my false eyelashes on without a hitch.</li>
    <li> Look I&#x27;m being as honest as i can when i got this product it smelled something awful just the worst smell ever it was used and had eyelash glue all over it as if they literally used it before they shipped it.its so wrong what there people are doing i don&#x27;t care if it was a penny it&#x27;s so unsanitary i literally threw it away as soon as i opened :( I&#x27;m reporting them too ebay please do the same it&#x27;s just disgusting and god knows just how unsanitary it really was for me too inhale that smell and touch this used product :( please do not buy from these people I&#x27;m just trying too help out target has these products cheap so does walgreens and walmart and so on good luck if you go ahead and order</li>
    <li> This is a really great product.  Speaks for itself.  Quality is really great as well. No instructions,  but it&#x27;s pretty to use. This package comes a lot sooner than expected.  It&#x27;s delivered way faster than what the delivery date says.</li>
    <li> Came in O.K shape, but still works! It is much easier than using your hands to apply eyelashes! Thank You!</li>
    <li> I recieved my product yesterday it was broken and the end was melted up. I just need to go to the store and get it because this was such a dissapointment.</li>
    <li> i love my false lashes but i hated doing them with tweezers. this product is great and very help ful</li>
    <li> the lashes were too rigid despite all my manipulation and trimming the remain unusable too thick and SUPER FAKE looking. The applicator and clip were a joke.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t use this product yet. It came without instructions and mine was broken. Don&#x27;t want to say I don&#x27;t like it because I haven&#x27;t used it yet but the star ratings are already made up. If anyone know how to use this product please explain how to. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This product can be purchased .... fast .... seller and good quality .... I am satisfied .................</li>
    <li> Works like a charm - pretty cool, not what I expected, my curiosity has been satisfied ...I find the glue applicator really helpful!!</li>
    <li> Great. Took some time to arrive. But I thought that the glue was included. Must have not read the ad properly. But I rarely use it. It was cheap and it was just an accidentally purchased item.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d send it back but it simply isn&#x27;t worth the effort. It came all warped and the instructions were overly simplified.</li>
    <li> the clear part doesnt work and the packaging was warped and shoved into the small envelope it was shipped in. the eyelashes applicator works.</li>
    <li> i thought the clip holder would be tighter but its not its really loose. i just dont use them .</li>
    <li> I love the way the blue eyelash holder is made. It is an unusual, helpful tool.I do not like the fact that there were no instructions because it is in Chinese or Japanese and I cannot read them! LOL It is funny, but I do not know how to use this blue thing.</li>
    <li> This took forever to get since it was shipped from over-seas, but its a great tool. I didn&#x27;t use the little hump thing to put the glue on, but the clamps are great. My only complaint was that it sort of flattens out the lash, so its a littl tricky to place on the eye if you&#x27;re new to wearing eyelashes</li>
    <li> Not as good of quality as expected. Sticks to the lashes. Its honestly nothing but a nuisance. I threw it away because it did nothing but take up room in my make up bag.</li>
    <li> Ive ordered it last month or maybe more and unfortunately not yet received, I am waiting for it, and I hope to receive it soon</li>
    <li> Very cheaply made!! Waste of money!!</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t find it useful at all</li>
    <li> Arrived broken, absolutely shattered after extensive waiting period.</li>
    <li> took forever to arrive but works well</li>
    <li> If you can&#x27;t read Chinese don&#x27;t buy this</li>
    <li> Wasnt what i expected....i don&#x27;t even use it.</li>
    <li> Still trying to figure out how best to hold lashes onto my eye without crushing my eye lid, lol</li>
    <li> i found that this produce is not as new as the picture has shown. The applicator is turned to be yellow. The clip is dirty. It seems that someone used it before.</li>
    <li> A cheap price usually means a cheap product and this is no exception. The clamp seems to be made for cyclops sized eyes, but the rubber eyelash holder is handy to have.</li>
    <li> Hi..I received the clip  before 2 days in a very bad and it&#x27;s not clean like a user..I will not used..thanks</li>
    <li> Does this come with the glue also or just the applicator ?</li>
    <li> I have a hard time putting lashes on by hand, this little tool really helped! Recommend this for those new to lashes, historically find it hard or pros that just want move faster!</li>
    <li> So....I had to sign for this product when it arrived.  It took forever to get here and any instructions you may need is only in chinese.  Pitiful.  Not worth it to send it back.  Wasted the money for it.</li>
    <li> Kind of confusing to use.</li>
    <li> It works but product arrived loose in a bag with no instructions.</li>
    <li> DIRTY PRODUCT.  Product is sticky and appears to be used.</li>
    <li> The product to me is hard to use. I have tried many time to use it but in just don&#x27;t work for me. It a good Idea but it&#x27;s easier for me to just put my eyelash&#x27;s on without it.</li>
    <li> This was exactly what they described just remember its quality is less than cheap children&#x27;s toys. I would not recommend. It still have not been able to use it because its too big and bulky.</li>
    <li> It looks very easy to use but it actually is not as easy as it looks</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t know how to use it lol</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure exactly what the plastic white piece is for. I think it&#x27;s for reusing the lashes, but it doesn&#x27;t work very well to hold them on. I do love the took itself though. it works way better than my stubby fingers.</li>
    <li> Looks like it could be pre used, or sitting in a warehouse for a decade. Plastic was all yellowed and it was not in packaging. But works great.</li>
    <li> I am capable of applying lashes to another person, but to myself.  There is something about the mirror backwardness that creates a perfect mess of lashes, glue and my face.  This handy little gadget makes it quick and easy to get my lashes on with minimal frustration.</li>
    <li> I love it. :) I guess some people were surprised that the instructions weren&#x27;t in English? Well, I checked where it&#x27;s coming from and for anyone else who didn&#x27;t it came from China. And no the instructions weren&#x27;t in English but I felt it was pretty 1-2 common sense application. If you really struggle with it there are video tutorials to walk you through using it. I wear glasses and can&#x27;t see anything, applying lashes are the toughest part of my makeup routine. But this applicator was a huge help! You should know it doesn&#x27;t come with eyelash glue, or at least mine didn&#x27;t. Otherwise I&#x27;m happy with it. :)</li>
    <li> i just love dis gadget it makes appy my eyelash strips so amazingly simple and accurate i dont knw how i functioned without it before lol im in love with it ......</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this. It does not fit to my eyelid and goes on lopsided. The stand is also useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: It&#x27;s not so bad once you get use to it. It just takes practice.&lt;br /&gt;Update 4/10/2015: I suggest you buying something else that has a smaller surface contact with your false lashes. Smaller contact will give you better accuracy and control.</li>
