      <li>I loved it so much!!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many lotions over the years and this is far and away the best.</li>
      <li>Nice and clean!</li>
      <li>I received a sample of this lotion in my Birchbox and immediately fell in love with</li>
      <li>but I always make sure to use my cream.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something with lactic acid, better to try Amlactin.</li>

      <li>It looks healthy and feels quenched.</li>
      <li>I purchased the tubes for awhile but found this to be more convenient.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I love this cream.  </li>
      <li>I love how hydrated and smooth my skin feels throughout the day.</li>
      <li>Lovely clean smelling scent.</li>
      <li>I also am allergic to most things and this is a clean product for that.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s non-greasy and almost scent free.</li>
      <li>This lotion is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>it feels great on my body.a simple lotion to use on all parts of your body.great for man too.</li>
      <li>I received it very well wrapped!!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light, but rich, creamy, not greasy, and absorbs fully without feeling sticky or tacky.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell (mildly floral, but not so strong that my boyfriend won&#x27;t use it), its light and not greasy, yet really moisturizes.</li>
      <li>It comes in a huge bottle so the $29 is well worth the money.  </li>
      <li>Absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t get all over your clothes.</li>
      <li>I am also 8 months pregnant and have used this lotion during the day and coconut oil at night for stretch mark prevention.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it and recommend it highly.</li>
      <li>Awesome and long lasting.</li>
      <li>greasy, light moisturizer that really does the trick.  </li>
      <li>One last compliment - it penetrates nicely into your pores and lasts all day.</li>
      <li>This cream is easily absorbed into the skin.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
      <li>for a basic body lotion, this has wonderful texture, is light enough to absorbs fast and keeps your skin moisturized and soft.</li>
      <li>I first learned of it from a Pixiwoo video.  </li>
      <li>Well, it cost a ton on the Birch website, so I always go to Amazon first.</li>
      <li>Smells so fresh, hydrates all day (even in cold climates) and an amazing after-sun lotion!!</li>
      <li>Amazing how soft and supple this porduct makes really dry skin feel with our being greasy</li>
      <li>I love all the Embryolisse products and this body cream is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very dry skin</li>
      <li>The consistency is like a thick milk - so good.</li>
      <li>i read the ratings and while I agree the scent is nice and it does absorb well, the effects don&#x27;t last long.  </li>
      <li>I highly doubt there are many active ingredients in this lotion but</li>
      <li>This keeps my body and hands silky smooth all day long!</li>
      <li>Now that I&#x27;ve started using this, I&#x27;ll never use anything else -- it absorbs quickly and has a subtle scent that I love.  </li>
      <li>My skin is super dry so this lotion keeps my skin really moisturized.  </li>
      <li>This lotion is thin and silky and soaks into your skin right away instead of staying on top.</li>
      <li>Although it is costlier than other creams, I think it&#x27;s completely worth it!</li>
      <li>So far, I have no stretch marks!</li>
      <li>/&gt;The cream is not heavy, and it doesn&#x27;t have an unseemly odor.</li>
      <li>The French really know their stuff.</li>
      <li>This is the 2nd time I&#x27;ve bought this lotion because my skin absolutely loves it.</li>
      <li>Either way, my skin is so soft and my lover always compliments my skin.</li>
      <li>It works very well and seems to work for several days.  </li>
      <li>My skin was pretty dry after 8 hours</li>
      <li>But still its just a lotion... a really soft, long lasting, and worth the money, but does it remove the age spots, No.  </li>
      <li>Unbelievably moisturizing for such a light feeling fluid.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s done wonders for my dry, sensitive skin!</li>
      <li>and this keeps it soft and silky all year long.</li>
      <li>I have zero base tan and many possibilities to burn, but this stuff really helped me keep my skin hydrated and healed!!</li>

    <li> Smells so fresh, hydrates all day (even in cold climates) and an amazing after-sun lotion!! (I didn&#x27;t peel at all after a trip to Mexico and we live in Seattle-so needless to say, I have zero base tan and many possibilities to burn, but this stuff really helped me keep my skin hydrated and healed!!</li>
    <li> This lotion is fantastic.  I first learned of it from a Pixiwoo video.  I started with the face cream, and immediately knew I wanted to try the body/hand lotion.  It&#x27;s light, but rich, creamy, not greasy, and absorbs fully without feeling sticky or tacky.  Fantastic!!!!!  Arrived relatively quickly in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> I love this product. This is the 2nd time I&#x27;ve bought this lotion because my skin absolutely loves it. I am also 8 months pregnant and have used this lotion during the day and coconut oil at night for stretch mark prevention. So far, I have no stretch marks! This product may be another great preventative measure for them! Either way, my skin is so soft and my lover always compliments my skin. It looks healthy and feels quenched. One last compliment - it penetrates nicely into your pores and lasts all day. You can feel your skin soaking it up whereas some lotions sit on the surface and do not really give your skin the nourishment that it needs. DEFINITELY buy this product!!

    <li> Amazing how soft and supple this porduct makes really dry skin feel with our being greasy</li>
    <li> it is a all around lotion i can use before my face cremes as one of my layers.and it feels great on my body.a simple lotion to use on all parts of your body.great for man too.</li>
    <li> I love this cream.  My skin is super dry so this lotion keeps my skin really moisturized.  It comes in a huge bottle so the $29 is well worth the money.  Def.  like this product over other expensive products I have tried.</li>

    <li> I got a sample of this in my Birch Box one month adn LOVED it. So I set out to order it. Well, it cost a ton on the Birch website, so I always go to Amazon first. Loved their price and ordered it and got a huge bottle! Can&#x27;t beat that! Birch Box called it a 24 hour miracle cream. It smells good too! Nice and clean! Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Great Lait Creme perfect for hot weather. Not greasy and feels great on the skin. Hydration 24 hour. Just perfect</li>
    <li> I just love this cream! It feels so wonderful when you put it on! And its lasts with its emulsion on your skin to keep it from drying out. I would not buy any other cream!!!</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this lotion in my Birchbox and immediately fell in love with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is not heavy, and it doesn&#x27;t have an unseemly odor. I use it on my face every morning and evening. In the mornings, I apply it as a moisturizer and let it soak in for a few minutes before applying my makeup. I love how hydrated and smooth my skin feels throughout the day. At night, I apply it after my shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed the wrinkles on my forehead are less noticeable after only three weeks of using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not one to engage in lengthy nighttime rituals, but I always make sure to use my cream. Although it is costlier than other creams, I think it&#x27;s completely worth it!</li>
    <li> Wonderful light moisturizer cream. Absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t get all over your clothes. Great smell too</li>
    <li> i read the ratings and while I agree the scent is nice and it does absorb well, the effects don&#x27;t last long.  My skin was pretty dry after 8 hours and I&#x27;m not used to that.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
    <li> Awesome and long lasting.</li>
    <li> I like Emryolisse facial products, so I thought I&#x27;d try the body lotion. It ended up being not great for severely dry skin. If you&#x27;re looking for something with lactic acid, better to try Amlactin.</li>
    <li> I love all the Embryolisse products and this body cream is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very dry skin and this keeps it soft and silky all year long.</li>
    <li> Had to buy this for work at NYFW but decided to try the 24 hour Miracle cream and fell in love.  All the models wanted this product used on them.  I have since purchased a 24 hour cream for myself. I love it!!!</li>
    <li> My daughter recomended this brand as she has used it in the past.  It works very well and seems to work for several days.  It is expensive but she said this size was the best deal.  It should last a long time.</li>
    <li> I loved it so much!!! I received it very well wrapped!!!</li>
    <li> I knew I would not be disappointed with another Embryolisse product. Like the Lait-Creme Concentre face cream, this lotion spreads beautifully and moisturizes like a dream. The consistency is like a thick milk - so good. This keeps my body and hands silky smooth all day long!</li>
    <li> Now that I&#x27;ve started using this, I&#x27;ll never use anything else -- it absorbs quickly and has a subtle scent that I love.  It&#x27;s done wonders for my dry, sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> I heard a lot about this brand and so I thought I give it a go !  This lotion has a faint scent which I don&#x27;t like and it does not help with my extremely dry skin - so much for the miracle cream!  The Bioderma works better for me !</li>
    <li> I purchased the tubes for awhile but found this to be more convenient.  Great product for none greasy, light moisturizer that really does the trick.  I have dry skin and it makes a big difference.  I also am allergic to most things and this is a clean product for that.  Try it.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Best primer, and moisturizer.. Has saved my skin..</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  I don&#x27;t know that it is a \\&quot;Miracle Cream\\&quot; but it sure goes on smooth and is one of the best lotions I&#x27;ve tried. But still its just a lotion... a really soft, long lasting, and worth the money, but does it remove the age spots, No.  Does it lessen wrinkles? No. So if you are going to label something a \\&quot;Miracle\\&quot; it should do something than be a really great lotion, right?!  There are an awful lot of great lotions to choose from now days!</li>
    <li> I highly doubt there are many active ingredients in this lotion but for a basic body lotion, this has wonderful texture, is light enough to absorbs fast and keeps your skin moisturized and soft. I absolutely love it and recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> This lotion is thin and silky and soaks into your skin right away instead of staying on top. It is not greasy at all. Great for all seasons!</li>
