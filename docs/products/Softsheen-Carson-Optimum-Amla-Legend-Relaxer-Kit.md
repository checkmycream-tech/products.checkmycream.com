      <li>I love Optimum Amla Legend Relaxer!</li>
      <li>I would have got even more beautiful results...</li>
      <li>This relaxer is like pure lye!!!!!</li>
      <li>so there&#x27;s no reason this relaxer should have burned as it did so quickly!!!</li>
      <li>After applying, I immediately experienced burning, heachaches, scalp irritation and more burning with the neutulizer.  </li>
      <li>My hairdressers ask me to apply my own relaxer because they know I&#x27;m good at it</li>
      <li>Love this relaxer!</li>
      <li>I decided to use my own shampoo and added coconut, olive oil and any conditioner</li>
      <li>I honestly thought I was having an allergic reaction to the product.</li>
      <li>Stopped by Walmart yesterday and decided to purchase Amla Legend because my laziness liked the no mix aspect of it.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think twice about the purchase cause many years ago me and my mom used optimum no lye relaxer...</li>
      <li>I was kind of prepared for that as I read reviews on line before using the product</li>
      <li>I have been relaxing my own hair since 15.</li>
      <li>and I thought this one would also be nice because of the oil that&#x27;s in it.</li>
      <li>I experienced immediate burning and a ziplock bag full of hair.</li>
      <li>I figure if their hair color is this fabulous and amazing, I cant imagine how good their relaxer must be...</li>
      <li>I thought for sure my hair would burn and fall out with the Optimum Alma Relaxer like so many of these reviews have stated, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>and ive tried it all,  this product is very strong but it works if you know how to manage it.</li>
      <li>OMG, my head was burnnnnning and is still hurting right now!!!</li>
      <li>The shampoo and conditioner smell wonderful and my hair is really soft.</li>
      <li>Get to the instruction sheet, it says: \\&quot;may not be suitable for all hair types\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best relaxer I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
      <li>Even though this product makes your hair burn, I must say it does get your hair nice and bone straight and beautiful.</li>
      <li>I am not too sure how people are putting this relaxer in their hair.</li>
      <li>Better losing money, than losing my hair and scalp.</li>
      <li>like most boxed relaxers do...</li>
      <li>I used the pre-treatment which I love and</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t lose any hair like most...</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>My mom wasn&#x27;t even able to do any smoothing.</li>
      <li>one!&lt;br /&gt;First off, I love the fact that there is NO MIXING.</li>
      <li>many women have lost their hair and burned their scalp from this product.  </li>
      <li>Okay people.......</li>
      <li>Also make sure that your scalp isn&#x27;t irritated before applying, because it is, after all, a chemical.</li>
      <li>I could tell immediately that this relaxer was more nourishing</li>
      <li>I still love this relaxer.  </li>
      <li>My scalp and hair remains healthy.  </li>
      <li>And I kinda of been able to use a product for years and switch up and be ok.....  </li>
      <li>Also, I had heard about Amla oil and its many benefits.  </li>
      <li>and I would be pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>It was okay</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
      <li>Used all the neutralizer included in the box and more of what we had already.</li>
      <li>I used almost all of the neutralizing shampoo just to make sure I got it all out and kept the conditioner in my hair for 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>I have used many different name brand relaxers and this is one of the best.</li>
      <li>$2 more for this, go figure.  </li>
      <li>I love their non-permanent hair color.</li>
      <li>Now when I happened to look there are hordes of them everywhere, even on hair blogs, mostly negative.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>But I would sincerely advise SoftSheen Carson to look into these matters.  </li>
      <li>and I never leave any relaxer on more then 8 minutes.</li>
      <li>I am going to have to chop off most of my hair shoulder length to recover from the damage done by this product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m satisfied and will use Amla Legend again.</li>
      <li>My friend swears by this and since she lives in NY and never has time to shop because of work I have gifted her this product for xmas.</li>
      <li>ok if zero stars was an option that would be my rating.</li>
      <li>NOW DEALING WITH BALDING AND SHEDDING FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE!!!</li>
      <li>but I can say, labor pains was nothing compared to Soft Sheen Carson Optimum Amla legend (in the teal box)!</li>
      <li>I had a beautiful grade of hair, very healthy, &amp; long.</li>
      <li>This relaxer was $2 bucks more than the optimum care anti-breakage relaxer we normally use.</li>
      <li>Surprisingly, my hair is bone straight.</li>
      <li>It straigtened my hair and it was easy to use.  </li>
      <li>and you should wash it out when your hair/scalp tells you to if that tingling sensation is strong before the application time is up</li>
      <li>no doubt I&#x27;d have more than a passing resemblance to ainsley harriot right now!</li>
      <li>I have been using Optimum Regular strength relaxer for many, many years.</li>
      <li>In the past months I have not taken excellent care of my hair, but it was reasonably healthy.  </li>
      <li>Everything went fine until 2weeks ago when I noticed breakage.</li>
      <li>I dint even have the time to smooth  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this product before read these reviews but I am very happy with the outcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a very sensitive scalp and my hair is medium length, coarse and brittle after relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been relaxing my hair for several years now and I normally use Dark and Lovely with Shea butter - regular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased Amla Legend relaxer at Wal-Mart for about $9.00 because they were out of Dark and Lovely and the box stated it&#x27;s a no mix formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I&#x27;ve a lot of experience with home relaxers, I read and followed the instructions very closely.  I used the pre-treatment which I love and I parted my hair in four sections.  I started at the nape of my neck as instructed and worked my way through all sections covering the new growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It began to tingle almost immediately and I started to get nervous.  The tingling continued as I quickly smoothed all sections.  I did not leave it on for the full recommended time because I was concerned that my scalp would burn and I&#x27;ve have scabs to deal with in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed my hair using the entire bottle of neutralizer, applied the conditioner with a conditioning cap for about 15 minutes(10 minutes longer than recommended), applied the moisturizer and then dried my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised.  My hair is extremely soft, full of body and bouncy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m satisfied and will use Amla Legend again.</li>
    <li> I used a scalp protector but the product began burning my scalp within 30 seconds of me applying it! A strand of hair coated with relaxer touched my face and the region of my face also started to sting and turn red. I rushed to the bathroom immediately to rinse it out. I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This relaxer is terrible. My aunt has burn marks on her neck and scalp. Her hair is ruined and will probably have to cut it off. Stay away from this product. Also her face swelled and her neck is scared. She had to go to a doctor!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve getting relaxers for over 10 years now, and this one is by far the worse one as far as burning... I set a timer for my type of hair, and according to the instructions it would take 20 mins total... I barely made it 15 mins.. Granted it did get the job done... The burning was horrific!!! The conditioner and moisturerizer were wonderful.. I wanted to try this product because I really like the oil itself.. But this relaxer is not meant for everyone... You really dont want to use this if you have a sensitive scalp...  I was sold because Sally&#x27;s had it on sale and it was pre-mixed... I would not be using this again</li>
    <li> Hair fell out in clumps. Still falling out. You&#x27;ve been warned. Don&#x27;t buy this product. Very bad results</li>
    <li> My friend swears by this and since she lives in NY and never has time to shop because of work I have gifted her this product for xmas. she is not a minority but has extremely wavy hair and was spending $100 every month to keep her hair straight. This works. Stated it is not harsh but very gentle and effects lasts for 3 months.</li>
    <li> ***I WANT TO SUE THIS COMPANY. ****I AM 42 YEARS OLD AND I HAVE BEEN RELAXING MY OWN HAIR SINCE I WAS 17 YEARS OLD, AND HAVE NEVER BEEN THIS TRAUMATIZED. YESTERDAY 8-21-13 WENT AND PURCHASED THIS AMLA RELAXER. (NORMALLY I USE MILD OR REGULAR). BUT THIS BOX DID NOT SAY IF IT WAS MILD, REGULAR OR SUPER STRENGHT. I ASKED THE SALES CLERK AND SHE SAID IT WAS FOR ALL HAIR TYPES. AROUND 8:25PM AFTER APPLYING THE SCLAP TREATMENT BASE, I STARTED APPLYING THE RELAXER AND IMMEDIATELY MY SCALP WAS ON FIRE. 5-10 MINUTES LATER ALL THE HAIR  AT THE FRONT OF MY HEAD FELL OUT AS I RINSED THIS CRAP OFF MY HAIR. i AM SO TRAUMATIZED BY THIS EXPERIENCE. NOW I AM COMPLETELY BALD ON THE FRONT PORTION OF MY HEAD ( COMPLETELY BALD FROM THE CROWN TO MY FOREHEAD). AND TODAY 8-22-13 MY SCALP IS STILL HURTING AND BURNING. I ONLY HAVE HAIR IN THE BACK OF MY HEAD. I AM SO DEPRESSED AND TRAUMATIZED FROM THIS EXPERIENCE THIS COMPANY NEED TO STOP SELLING THIS PRODUCT. IT IS MISLABELED.</li>
    <li> Attention ladies.. DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!  My hair is falling out in clumps and I have no hair in the lower back of my head at all.  This company has to be sued and this product needs to be taken off the market. No one should have to go through this at all.  We need a class action lawsuit to go in effect immediately.  I wish I read these reviews before I purchased this product..Alma Legends relaxer!!!!! Save yourself while you still have time.  If you want to keep your hair and your sanity you will not use this product.  I have been natural for atleast two years and went to the store to purchase products for a blowout but the products weren&#x27;t in stock so I decided to relax my hair, worst decision in my life!!! I will be obtaining a lawyer because this is just wrong.  So once again...do not buy this product..please do not fall for their propaganda! I cannot stress this fact enough!! The worst!</li>
    <li> Burned my scalp immediately after putting in, but I can handle that. There are so many negative reviews on this it&#x27;s unreal. I lost a little bit of hair but who cares? It&#x27;s not the end of the world, and it wasn&#x27;t very much. I&#x27;ve gone several months without having to relax my hair. This stuff really worked!</li>
    <li> PLEASE CONTACT CARSON - WE NEED A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT.  I STILL HAVE RECEIPT AND COPIES OF THE BOX.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On November 12, 2013, I tried Alma after seeing it on TV. I was refunded by Carson after writing them and Sally beauty outlet. Carson products took all info and batch numbers from the box. Please tell everyone to contact them on their website. I experienced immediate burning and a ziplock bag full of hair. I also have 2-3 bald spots in my hair. I had a healthy head of shoulder length hair, now it is above my ears. Please don&#x27;t use this product! I will follow class action lawsuit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I contacted Carson Soft Sheen they just took information from my Amla relaxer box. No receipt was required and I was mailed a $9.99 check and a letter of apology. I also went to Sally beauty outlet and got a refund. But I copied the box before I returned the product for proof in the event of a class action lawsuit. The store should refund you money without a receipt. I will continue to pursue this claim.</li>
    <li> Please, please, please don&#x27;t use this product! Even with the  scalp protector my whole head is chemically burnt and weeping after only 5 minutes with the product on- and I followed this to the letter! The only saving grace is that so far I haven&#x27;t suffered as much hair loss as I relax mine only twice yearly, if I was a regular user no doubt I&#x27;d have more than a passing resemblance to ainsley harriot right now! This is such a bad product they won&#x27;t even sell it in the States! Be warned sisters!</li>
    <li> I take good care of my hair.  I now have damaged hair that varies from bra strap length to two inches clumps in some areas to bald patches in others.  My hairline looks like Naomi Campbell&#x27;s.  I didn&#x27;t think the damage would be this great because I have used optimum no lye relexers for years but my hair fell out in clumps beginning about 1 week after retouching with this relaxer and it continued to fall out until it is now ready for a new retouch (9 weeks later).  I literally had visual black burns and scabs around my hairline immediately after. I&#x27;m afraid to wash my hair because of how much hair I will see going into the trash and drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rio hair didn&#x27;t even cause as much damage as this relaxer did to my hair.  I don&#x27;t understand how it is still on the shelves!</li>
    <li> I purchased this perm because it was new. My hair fell out My head was burning so BADD after 3 minutes. I have pictures where my hair was just falling out in chunks. PLEASE DONT USE THIS PERM!!!!!!!! THIS PERM IS HORRIBLE!!!!! IM BALD ALL IN THE CENTER OF MY HEAD AND MY SCALP LOOKS WHITE LIKE ITS BURNT!!!!!!! MY HAIR IS STILL SHEDDING BADD AFTER USING THIS PERM THREE WEEKS AGO!!!!! I HAD THE MOST BEAUTIFUL HAIR!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have long thick healthy bra strap length hair and usually use Soft &amp; Beautiful Botanical for my touch-ups every 3-4 months. I decided to purchase this perm from Walmart thinking that because it&#x27;s expensive, maybe it would be better than the Soft &amp; Beautiful that I&#x27;ve used for years. Also because of it&#x27;s &amp;#34;no mix&amp;#34; feature. Well...2 minutes after applying this product to the lower half of my head, trying carefully to avoid the scalp, my scalp was on fire. Now keep in mind that I do not have sensitive scalp and have never burned from any other relaxer. I honestly thought I was having an allergic reaction to the product. I quickly rinsed the crap off with their neutralizing shampoo. Even after rinsing 3-4 times, my scalp was still burning. I decided to use my own shampoo and added coconut, olive oil and any conditioner I could get my hands on to stop the stinging and breakage. Rinsed again another 4 times. I was in pain even after drying my hair. Now I have scabs all over my scalp.  Since then, I&#x27;ve had to add olive oil to my scalp every day to soften the scabs and so that my fair does not continue to fall out. This is by far the worse experience I&#x27;ve ever had with a relaxer.  There really should be a class-action lawsuit against this product.</li>
    <li> I wish it was possible to give this product NEGATIVE stars.This is the worst relaxer I have ever used! My hair is considerably thick and strong and can take its fair share of \\&quot;punishment\\&quot;, but this relaxer has cause immediate, severe, continuous breakage and shedding in the back portion of my hair. Not to mention it torched my scalp and left my hair dry and stiff. They should pull this disgraceful attempt of a relaxer off the shelves!</li>
    <li> My hair is falling out! It left really bad chemical burns on my scalp. My hair is forever damaged! This is the worst hair product I&#x27;ve ever used. I can&#x27;t even run my fingers through my heart without have a hand of hair afterwards</li>
    <li> i have never, i mean never written a review on a hair product, but as i sit here with conditioner on my head, i had to grab the laptop.  almost immediately i felt as others a burning sensation.  i have never had this happen before in my life.  I have permed my hair, mom, daughters, friends for years 25+ and I have never had this happen.  the only reason that i got this is because their were out of the regular optimum at walmart.  $2 more for this, go figure.  i hope my hair does not fall out.  please take this off the market.</li>
    <li> Now I have always relaxed my hair at home and I had never had any problems prior to using this thing that SHOULD NOT BE ON THE MARKET! I love their non-permanent hair color. I figure if their hair color is this fabulous and amazing, I cant imagine how good their relaxer must be... Jesus how wrong I was. Now I bought this for $11 at a Sallys, kinda pricey from my usual Africa organic root touch-up relaxer which I usually get for $5 and on sale for $3 at walgreens ( which is the best relaxer on earth!!). Now before I apply this stuff I hadn&#x27;t wash my hair in a week and I had plenty of oil in my hair for protection but just like the other reviewers said  THIS S*** BURNS!!! a little bit fell on my cheek and it burned my cheek! I dint even have the time to smooth  the back with how badly it was burning. I  Rinse it off before I shampoo and I use 1/2 of the neutralizer. Now my hair feels dry, brittle and  I&#x27;m scare to death this doesn&#x27;t leave permanent damage on my scalp. My scalp burns now, my eyelashes, and the spot on my cheek it fell on. None of this should of have happen if your scalp is very dirty so I cant imagine how powerful this stuff is. Do yourself a favor and avoid this relaxer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an old pro at home relaxing and I always have great results, but I can honestly say I&#x27;ve never experienced a product that burned the way this one did. I followed all of the instructions exactly and felt like my scalp was going to burn off.....RUN RUN RUN away from this product.</li>
    <li> This relaxer is great! It straigtened my hair and it was easy to use.  However it is marketed incorrectly! It is not a &amp;#34;No Lye&amp;#34; relaxer. It is a &amp;#34;Lye&amp;#34; relaxer. It is a lithium based lye, instead of a sodium based lye relaxer.  Lithium is the element just above sodium on the periodic table. All the elements in the same colum on the periodic table have the same &amp;#34;properties&amp;#34; just in different levels or &amp;#34;strengths&amp;#34; so to speak. Lithium hydroxide, the main ingredient in this relaxer, is just as caustic as sodium hydroxide and should never be applied with bare hands or to an unbased/injured scalp or damaged hair. I believe this is why people are reporting their hair has fallen out or their scalp and fingers/hand were burned. ****This is a LYE relaxer and must be used as a LYE relaxer or you will suffer hair/scalp injury!******</li>
    <li> I love this product the directions tell you not to apply directly to the scalp. I applied to my new growth and it straightened quickly. I barley used any product.my Haiti is hydrated and looks great.it did not burn my scalp.I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> YOU MIGHT AS WELL SET YOUR HAIR ON FIRE. I DON&#x27;T KNOW WHY THIS PRODUCT HASN&#x27;T BEEN RECALLED. IT IS THE WORST RELAXER IN THE WORLD. IT IS TERRIBLE.</li>
    <li> Back in November 2013 about two days before Thanksgiving I decided to get a relaxer. I was so excited because I was a few months post relaxer so I knew I had a lot of new growth. I wanted to see the length of my hair once the relaxer was finished. Well the reason I decided to get this relaxer was because I am always using Motion and I thought this one would also be nice because of the oil that&#x27;s in it. Well let&#x27;s just same I regret putting this relaxer in my hair. The relaxer burn my scalp like no other relaxer. I couldn&#x27;t wait to wash it out. My hair use to be down my back, a little passed my bra strap well now my hair is in a mini fro. I am so disappointed because I am so used to having long hair but all my long hair has been stripped from me. This relaxer has made me not want another relaxer ever again. I have decided to go natural. I know it may take me a few years to regrow my hair back to the length it use to be, but I am willing to give it my all to grow my hair back. Please if you are reading my review save yourself from the damage and go purchase a different relaxer or none at all. Just don&#x27;t buy this brand.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have ever reviewed a product as Amazon and I only do so to warn anyone and everyone to STAY AWAY FROM AMLA LEGEND.  I have been trying to grow my hair out for the last year and this product, after 15 minutes left bald spots, burned skin, and broken hair in it&#x27;s wake.  I, like other reviewers, have relaxed my own hair for years (almost 20 for me).  I know how to relax my hair.  My hairdressers ask me to apply my own relaxer because they know I&#x27;m good at it and they don&#x27;t want to take my money.  This product should be removed from shelves and I am going to take my box to every store in the Portland Oregon area to show them the damage this product did to my hair/scalp.  This madness must stop NOW!</li>
    <li> This is the worst product it burned my scalp now I&#x27;m dealing with dry brittle hair. Please stay away I&#x27;m suffering and considering yo chop all my hair off now as it&#x27;s falling out daily</li>
    <li> I have relaxed my hair for over 30 years and I was truly wowed by this one!&lt;br /&gt;First off, I love the fact that there is NO MIXING. It comes pre-mixed and I was able to use as much (or as little) as needed.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, the time I left it on was considerably less than other relaxers I&#x27;ve used in the past. This may be because it&#x27;s for ALL hair types. It was tingly within the first 5 or 6 minutes, so I rinsed it out and was amazed at the results. I have curly hair and I only use relaxers to take some of the loose curl out.&lt;br /&gt;Now, mind you, this may not be the relaxer for everyone because everyone&#x27;s hair is different. But I can tell you, this one really worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;After I read some of the other reviews for this relaxer, some people described burning and bald spots. Like with any home relaxer, always use with caution and rinse out at the first sign of tingling. Also make sure that your scalp isn&#x27;t irritated before applying, because it is, after all, a chemical.</li>
    <li> This product was a disaster. I have used perms for 40 years and never had a problem. I read and followed all of the directions, including setting a timer to follow the directions. This perm took my hair out. I Mean Out. Some from the roots, some from the lengths. I was still trying to see what I can do. It has left me totally depressed. Please do not use this product. The hair that I have left on my head feels like straw.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for the first time at my local Family Dollar. I decided to do some research on it and came across over 30 negative reviews. I was going to take the product back this morning and get my usual Olive Oil Relaxer instead, but decided to take a chance. I have been relaxing my own hair since 15. My hair is fine, but thick in the middle area. I usually go for the Super Strength, which always burns and irritates my scalp. I thought for sure my hair would burn and fall out with the Optimum Alma Relaxer like so many of these reviews have stated, but it didn&#x27;t. At all! I had just taken down some box braids yesterday. My hair is also bleached on the ends. I sectioned my hair in 4 and applied the scalp protector along the edges, nape of neck and scalp like the instructions said. I also combed my hair out without combing the scalp before applying the relaxer. I applied the relaxer, then smoothed with my hands. I even left the relaxer in for 25 minutes, which exceeded the instructed processing time. I rinsed thoroughly, then shampooed. I now have the conditioner in and it has been in for about an hour. Guess what??? This relaxer DID NOT burn, irritate or break ANY of my hair off!! I guess we all follow directions differently. I would advise anyone who purchases this product to use the scalp protector as instructed. I believe it&#x27;s a reason it&#x27;s in the box. So far, I am giving this product 4 stars and not 5 because it didn&#x27;t wash out in 2 washes like usual. Other than that, I still have my midback length hair, no bald spots and no chemical burns, which I usually get after relaxing. I will update after blowdrying and flatironing.</li>
    <li> Saw this at walmart, and decided to try it. My mom has been relaxing my hair with box perms in between salon visits my entire 26 years. This relaxer was $2 bucks more than the optimum care anti-breakage relaxer we normally use. My mom followed all the instructions as directed, and within 5 min the back and sides were on fire. This is after my mom applied the scalp protectant.  After 5min I started yelling my scalp was on fire, and it felt like my brain was on fire.  My mom wasn&#x27;t even able to do any smoothing. I repeat after 5min, my whole head was on fire. My mom immediately washed it out, and i had to take Advil and can barely stand to have my head touched. Surprisingly, my hair is bone straight. What kind of relaxer makes your hair bone straight in 5min with absolutely no smoothing time!?! A relaxer that&#x27;s for \\&quot;all hair types,\\&quot; that&#x27;s what. I thought it said regular, but no it&#x27;s all hair types in one box.  I&#x27;m sitting here with a wet head hoping and praying my hair won&#x27;t fall out. Only time will tell. In the meantime, I&#x27;m warning you not to use this,  and I will be calling this company tomorrow.</li>
    <li> I recently tried this product and I must say please be careful when using this on your hair. I applied the scalp cream that came in the box and I applied the relaxer to my hair. I made sure that i just put it on the new growth and I was working it in very fast. Even though i was doing that it was still burning 5 minutes into the process. I hurried up and smoothed my hair as much as i could and washed my hair. Even though this product makes your hair burn, I must say it does get your hair nice and bone straight and beautiful. If you are going to use this product please try to work it in fast because the burning is no joke!</li>
    <li> The relaxer does a great job on coarse, thick hair.  I read the previous reviews and I took a chance since I read the concerns about  the burning and hair loss.  There was no hair loss.  I based the scalp then applied the relaxer.  I did not have time to smooth it section by section due to scalp irritation. (Hair was brushed and combed daily, especially the edges to make it presentable since it was 8 wks post relaxer).  Yet, the hair was relaxed. I purchased this from a local drugstore.  I still love this relaxer.  My scalp and hair remains healthy.  As soon as there is a tingling sensation, I rinse the relaxer. Keep in mind that you must apply product quickly,</li>
    <li> Okay so recently I purchased this relaxer cause my normal was out of stock. I didn&#x27;t think twice about the purchase cause many years ago me and my mom used optimum no lye relaxer... And I kinda of been able to use a product for years and switch up and be ok.....  BOY WAS I WRONG!!!! The first time I used this relaxer it did burn 5 min within applying but I figured it was because I just had my sides tappered down. I over looked it.  I went and bought all the products that went with this line... I  shampooed and conditioned once a week . So about 6weeks later (cause I have short hair) after getting another cut and needing a touch up and color( semi permanent color) I bought the relaxer and there semi permanent color and had my mom touch me up... Everything went fine until 2weeks ago when I noticed breakage. I was clueless I thought what was happening why is this happening? And a light bulb went off in my head the only thing I&#x27;ve done differently with my hair is the products I was using. I&#x27;m am so sad inside because I made a choice 9 yrs ago to chop my hair off  cause he love I have for short hair and now I don&#x27;t know what other options I have for he damage that has been done.. If there ever is a lawsuit against the company I&#x27;m all in!!!!!!!!! What is the next step to save my already short hair?</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be alarmed that I don&#x27;t have &amp;#34;Amazon Verified Purchase&amp;#34; under my heading.  I did NOT purchase this relaxer from Amazon. However I HAVE purchased it, twice.  I have lost $20 ($10 for each box) and a good portion of my hair.  If not purchasing through AMAZON is a problem, please see the other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1)  I am not a wealthy woman.  My usual routine is to purchase a relaxer from a store and apply it myself.  Wanting a relaxer that did NOT need to be mixed, I bought this one. Also, I had heard about Amla oil and its many benefits.  My sister uses Indian/Ayurvedic products on her hair and she has been given great results.  My feeling was that my hair had a new friend when I purchased this relaxer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) MY HAIR FELL OUT IN CLUMPS immediately following the application of this relaxer.  It has continued to fall out steadily since.  I believe it is only through the effectiveness of the supplements I take &amp; the superiority of the other products I use on my hair that I HAVE HAIR at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(3) In the past months I have not taken excellent care of my hair, but it was reasonably healthy.  In the summer months (several months before I bought these in November), I used a keratin treatment.  It was okay but I found it time-consuming and was not fond of the minor stinging.  I ASSUMED my hair loss was due to this growing out/being washed away.  This is the only reason why I made the horrible mistake of purchasing another box of this (which I have not applied)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(4) When I bought this relaxer I did look up the reviews. There were none it seemed, anywhere.  Now when I happened to look there are hordes of them everywhere, even on hair blogs, mostly negative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(5) I am not sure if the issue is with the relaxer chemicals or a bad batch of Amla oil, or whatever.  But I would sincerely advise SoftSheen Carson to look into these matters.  If they correct the issues, they desperately need to redo this and then market it differently and even change the packaging.  Only the adventurous would try to use something in the same vein again...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(6) True story:  In the early 1990s I saw the many &amp;#34;Rio&amp;#34; commercials.  I ordered it and it never came.  I even got my money back. I was never able to order it again. Then, all the testimonials came out about women losing their hair.  Well, this is history repeating itself, only in my own case, I managed to get hold of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does anyone know where I can return this?  I will be sending it to them.  Maybe I won&#x27;t get my money back but I need to let them know how I feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----Mark&#x27;s wife</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t use it! My 26 year old daughter is upstairs crying her eyes out because her hair is gone. And I (her mother) relaxed it for her . We followed directions she has been relaxing for years . We did not leave it on too long. She now has no hair on the sides or back of her head. Even with the scalp protector and vaseline around her edges No Hair and her scalp is burned badly I did notice a lot of hair loss during rinsing but never imagined this. Stay away from this product I didn&#x27;t know how to do no stars so I did one but for us it&#x27;s a big fat 0 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Grandma Bembry</li>
    <li> Bad news!!!!!!!  I have always had very thick and a fairly decent length (shoulder length) hair, and have been relaxing my hair for the last 40 years.  After seeing a commercial where Johnny Wright promoted the line of products.....I bought it all.  Once I got past the fast burning when the relaxer was applied and processing,  I quickly thoroughly rinsed and was absolutely heart broken when after shampooing, my hair was coming out by the comb and handful, whole strands and clumps and the end result was hair that feels like straw or yarn and noticeably thinner.....really rough when before I&#x27;ve always had soft smooth results.  I foolishly thought it might be because I had changed products, and over the next few weeks continue to use the EXPENSIVE line of products, thinking that doing so would give my hair what it needed to recover.....at least that&#x27;s what it said it would do.  Needless to say my hair continued to break or and when shampooed continued to come out in clumps.  I am now combing my hair over bare spots and have NO hair around the edges.  DO NOT SUBJECT YOURSELF TO THIS TORTUROUS (financial, physical,and emotional) ABUSE!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 30 years old and have been doing my own relaxers since I was a teenager using two mirrors in the bathroom. I decided to try this after seeing it in Wal-Mart. I last used Creme of Nature w/ Argan Oil which gets 5 stars. Not this! This stuff burns to high hell! I have never experienced so much burning using relaxers in my entire life! (Well once with Motions store bought relaxer, and that was the last time I used that one too.) I&#x27;m lucky none of my hair fell out after using Amla today. I won&#x27;t be using this again. I&#x27;m sticking with Creme of Nature or Olive Oil. (both good relaxers) This on the other hand: NOT! BE WARNED! I was fanning my head just like Otis and Al in The Temptations movie when they got a \\&quot;process\\&quot; in 1958. I&#x27;ve NEVER done that before using a relaxer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The LIES: the box says \\&quot;for all hair types\\&quot;. Get to the instruction sheet, it says: \\&quot;may not be suitable for all hair types\\&quot;. What? I was already skeptical when it was a \\&quot;no-mix\\&quot; cream. I learned with other relaxers you have to mix that you have to put the relaxer in immediately after mixing it. I bought this relaxer in December and is just using it today. I should&#x27;ve read the reviews before even purchasing it. Btw, my box said \\&quot;regular\\&quot; and it still burned. \\&quot;Super\\&quot; burns.. so I never buy Super in any relaxer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5x the burn! It burned when putting the relaxer on. It burned when rinsing the relaxer out. It burned when shampooing and rinsing shampoo. It burned when rinsing the conditioner out. (All in places where scalp/pre-treatment was applied.) NEVER been through this EVER in my entire life! I&#x27;ll probably be washing it out in a week or two with Pantene. I haven&#x27;t experienced any of my hair coming out. And I pray I don&#x27;t. I comb with a wide-tooth comb when I put in conditioner and after rinsing. And when in need of a relaxer. My hair is naturally course and thick. I use Cantu Shea Butter strengthening treatment in between relaxers to protect my hair from damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rarelywrite reviews. But I just had to with this product. It should be recalled IMMEDIATELY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update (same day) :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After hair dried naturally, scalp started to burn again around nape and edges after applying Softee Herbal Gro hair dress and scalp conditioner. Softee is a great product. I was afraid to comb my hair after applying the hair grease in fear of my hair coming out. So I waited a few minutes. After combing, hair was a large afro, yet soft. (It was like MJ&#x27;s in the mid-70s.) I might as well buy afro sheen. But I guess I&#x27;ll just deal with another 4 hours of flat-ironing. I haven&#x27;t saw any hair loss other than the typical results in the comb after combing thick, course hair (w/ a wide tooth comb). I guess my hair is pretty strong and healthy prior to using this product. Thank God.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still don&#x27;t recommend this product. Other relaxers, sometimes, I don&#x27;t even need to use a flat iron.</li>
    <li> If I could give this product 0 stars I would! I have used soft sheens products for a long time and never had an experience like this! Within minutes of the product being in my hair my scalp was BURNING!!!!! I washed it out immediatly because I did not want to damage my hair. Later on that evening i could not even condition my hair because my scalp was so badly burned and starting to scab. The pain was so bad I had to take ibprofuen.  It Should be taken off the shelf!</li>
    <li> I tried this product after buying at local store in November 2013. I had never used it before I HAD almost shoulder length fine but naturally frizzy hair that I like to relax every 3-4 months to make styling easier and I never leave any relaxer on more then 8 minutes. Well I tried this before reading any reviews it just looked and sounded good and I wished I had never picked it up because after only 2 minutes it started burning my scalp and I rinsed it out right away and used Pantene and other conditioners and still almost all the hair in the rear of my neck area (kitchen) broke off right to the scalp the same evening. I did call the company to complain and they sent me a refund and offered some products that could help but I just wanted to advise as many people as possible that you must be very careful if you try this and I would not if what you have been using has been working it is not worth the risk trying a new product I have learned my lesson it will take me years to grow back the hair I lost.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have used many different name brand relaxers and this is one of the best. I purchased this product yesterday. My hairdresser was shocked that she did not have to mix anything. She said there was no smell after washing my hair like others, plus it left my hair very soft. It did not burn my hair like others have said. It was quick and easy and I use regular relaxers all the time so it is for every hair type. I would recommend this product to anyone. Just make sure you use it properly and have a professional apply it since they know more about how long it should stay in so there would not be an issue.</li>
    <li> yes I witness my hair falling out with this product . I did not realize until the other day &amp;#34; I said hold up my hair was not like this until I started using this product &amp;#34; .Yes and it burns real bad I will stop using this perm .Ive been using this perm for like a year now , and my hair is thinning , and a lot of breakage . Dont buy this product ever .</li>
    <li> I was tired of bone-straight hair after a relaxer so I decided to try something different. I got this because it was on sale. I was trying to \\&quot;texlax\\&quot; my hair and under-process (or what I considered under-processing) by rushing a bit. I applied it to my new-growth but didn&#x27;t work too hard to smooth it in. Just enough to get it spread and somewhat flat. By the time I was finished and ready to rinse out (after about 12 minutes), I did feel a burning/tingling sensation which I thought was odd because I usually take almost double the time with other relaxers. I used almost all of the neutralizing shampoo just to make sure I got it all out and kept the conditioner in my hair for 30 minutes. My hair feels great. I actually have less hair falling out and it&#x27;s soft, not dry or brittle like it sometimes is after a relaxer. I did it just long enough to lay my hair flat and make it manageable but no so much that it practically looks like it&#x27;s matted on my skull.  I&#x27;m pleased with it. I have other relaxer kits that work just as good without the risk of burning and this is definitely not a product to take more than 15 minutes to apply.</li>
    <li> Do not buy!!!! After applying, I immediately experienced burning, heachaches, scalp irritation and more burning with the neutulizer.  In the 1-2 weeks after my hair was extremely dry and I had to use a theraputic shampoo to get it back moisturized.  Something is terribly wrong with this relaxer!!!</li>
    <li> A little background: I&#x27;m 30 years old, with medium to fine high-density hair. I&#x27;ve been relaxing my own hair since I was 19, and prior to that, my mother did my relaxers. Always relaxed my hair once every 3-4 months because I could always manage my new growth. I&#x27;ve never had any issues with breakage/falling out, anything at all after relaxing my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note above that I said I had some high-density hair. So even though my hair is medium to fine, I had a heck of a lot of hair (think Chaka Khan, seriously). After using the ENTIRE bottle of neutralizer, when I went to detangle after conditioning, my hair started coming out in chunks. Just, chunks of hair coming out. It&#x27;s a week later, and my hair is still coming out. And I&#x27;m not talking about breakage, I&#x27;m talking about the entire strand is coming out from the root (and I have armpit length hair). So now, I&#x27;m taking every step I can to preserve the length and get my density back since I now have extremely thinned out hair...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Don&#x27;t buy this relaxer. It&#x27;s just not worth the risk.</li>
    <li> So I picked up the Amla Relaxer at CVS it was on sale two boxes for $12.00. I figured I hadn&#x27;t relaxed my hair in 6 months due to my pregnancy so I thought I would need two boxes. I ended up using only one and I have coarse full hair. I started in the back of my head and the relaxer started to tingle almost right away. I was kind of prepared for that as I read reviews on line before using the product so I don&#x27;t damage all this newly grown hair I have. I worked quickly really I think the key is parting your hair into 4 sections prior to application and working each section by parting a 2 inch high part and applying the relaxer to the new growth only. However this still must happen fast. You should look at the application time required for your hair type and try to apply the relaxer in leaving half that time remaing for smoothing with your hands. Most people might not be able to leave the relaxer on the entire time as it does tingle pretty fast. The product doesn&#x27;t smell as harsh as other relaxers and I didn&#x27;t experience much shedding at all. My hair was left shiny and soft and didnt appear to be dry or brittle as it normally is after I relax it. With other relaxer brands I usually spend hours after relaxing my hair trying to put moisture back into it and trying to get it to feel soft by deep conditioning and treating with hot oil. I didn&#x27;t have that problem with Amla Legend. I would say the pro is it really doesn&#x27;t damage your hair as you expect a relaxer to do. The con is you have to work quickly when applying and you should wash it out when your hair/scalp tells you to if that tingling sensation is strong before the application time is up or if you notice your hair is straight enough before the application time is up. I think with any product using common sense is the key to it working for you. I would never advise you to leave it on longer but to shorten the time if your hair reacts quickly to the product is always an option.</li>
    <li> PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS RELAXER!!! THIS IS THE WORST RELAXER I HAVE EVER USED!!! IT CAUSED SEVERE DAMAGE TO MY HAIR AND I AM  NOW DEALING WITH BALDING AND SHEDDING FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE!!! DO NOT USE OPTIMUM AMLA RELAXER IF YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR HAIR!!! I ALMOST NEVER POST REVIEWS BUT AFTER USING THIS PRODUCT I FEEL COMPELLED TO WARN OTHER WOMEN ABOUT THIS PRODUCT!!! I AM GOING TO TELL EVERYONE I KNOW TO STAY AWAY FROM THIS CRAP IN A JAR!!! TO THE MAKERS OF THIS PRODUCT: YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED BUT THANKS FOR HELPING ME MAKE UP MY MIND TO GO NATURAL!!!! I WILL NEVER USE ANY SOFT SHEEN PRODUCTS EVER AGAIN!!! IF I COULD SUE I WOULD!!!</li>
    <li> All my hair came out don&#x27;t buy this product</li>
    <li> Saw the ads on tv regarding this relaxer and thought I would give it at try. Parted my hair first in 4 sections as suggested and used the hair protectant that was also provided.  After about 10 minutes it did start to burn my scalp a little but nothing I couldn&#x27;t bear. I actually loved the results after the relaxing process. My hair was very silky and shiny and was not brittle like the red box optimum relaxer I used Before. I must say I am very happy with the results as my hair was previously over processed and this new product seemed to reverse some of that damage. Other than the quick burning,I would recommend this product as I did not experience any of my hair falling out.</li>
    <li> Well ladies I purchased this relaxer before I read all the reviews about it. So, needless to say, I was sooo nervous about using this product after the mixed reviews it received. I figured \\&quot;oh well\\&quot; I just spent $12 for a box relaxer, I&#x27;m going to use it. I wear my hair short, with a little length in the front, and any short haired sista will tell you, you must maintain the back.LOL.I used some tips from some of the ladies earler, like using the processing time down to the second or cutting it back...18 minutes later, my back was laid flat!! I love it. Will definitely use it again. The shampoo and conditioner smell wonderful and my hair is really soft. The only downside is that with other box relaxers, I can usually split them (two for the price of one) with this relaxer being pre-mixed I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a great idea to save the unused portion.</li>
    <li> Left it on the required amount of time, results were just acceptable</li>
    <li> Okay I&#x27;m going to try and keep it short. I purchased this relaxer @ a local drug store for $8.25 because they did not have the Optimum super that I normally purchase between my visits to my hairdresser. I have long, course, thick hair so I was a little hesitant to purchase it due to the fact that the strength of this relaxer was for all hair types. Needless to say I purchased it anyway. It is a premixed product so no more individual cream and activator to mix (less mess). The reason I am not giving this product 5 stars is because despite protecting my scalp the relaxer started to burn my scalp almost immediately. Bear in mind I do have a really sensitive scalp. The reason that I am scoring this product so high is because I kid you not my head was burning so I had no smoothing time before I washed the product out and my hair still came out bone straight. Another awesome thing about this relaxer is I usually have to use a regular moisturizing and a deep conditioner to fix the damage the box relaxer has caused. Not with this product my hair was soft and well hydrated. This relaxer system did not dry my hair out at all. I would definitely recommend this product, but if you have a sensitive scalp use extra base cream and try to keep the product off of your scalp as much as possible.</li>
    <li> I truly don&#x27;t understand the negative reviews! This is by far the best relaxer I&#x27;ve ever used! Leaves my hair soft and silky. No burns. No irritation.  I base my scalp thoroughly with a protective petroleum and I use Redken products for shampooing and conditioning then I mold my hair with Nairobi wrap-it shine foaming lotion and these together make my hair feel as if it&#x27;s been professionally done! I have short hair and naturally a 3b/3c type hair. Love this relaxer!</li>
    <li> I have never experienced burns like the burns from this product. buy the time I walked up the stairs to the bathroom it was unbearable. I pray my skin returns to normal and they should be sued.</li>
    <li> I am not too sure how people are putting this relaxer in their hair. But first things first, I bought this from Sally Beauty Supply for 9.99. This was my first time trying it. So I took it home and had my partner put the relaxer in my hair. What she did first was part my hair in 4 sections and poured olive oil in my scalp to protect my scalp. Now it does come with its own protective cream but because of ALL of the bad reviews I read I (we) wanted to be sure. By the way, I&#x27;m not the type of person that shies away because of someone else&#x27;s opinion so.... Anyway, she applied the no mix relaxer in the back first working her way upward. You DO want to move quickly. You DO want someone to help you if you feel like you can&#x27;t move fast enough alone. The whole straightening process with application and smoothing took 15 minutes. No more. Did it burn? No. Did it tingle? Yes, but only after 11-13 minutes. Did I need to call the fire department? Um...no. My hair is 3b/3c hair and it is mid length. It looks beautiful. It flows. It smells awesome and still has its bounce and fullness. If you want your hair bone/spaghetti straight then mmm...this may not be the one for you. My hair doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m overdue for a relaxer and it isn&#x27;t so straight and tight to my head that I look like skeletor. My hair is gorgeous! I love Optimum Amla Legend Relaxer!</li>
    <li> I have always used soft sheen relaxers, and I was suckered in by the no mix tag! I couldn&#x27;t even finish applying before my head was on FIRE! I immediately washed it out and my scalp was severely burned and I didn&#x27;t even have straight hair to show for it! RUN AWAY!!!</li>
    <li> As most people did I got suckered in to using this product due to the \\&quot;no mix\\&quot; tag. The relaxer wasn&#x27;t even on half of my head before it started to tingle. Now in no way shape form or fashion do I have a sensitive scalp. When I get a relaxer it usually doesn&#x27;t tingle/burn at all. Not with this relaxer! By the time I put the relaxer on my whole head it felt like it was on pure fire! Now I have burns around my edges and my hair didn&#x27;t even come out fully straight. Let&#x27;s just say I had no kind words to say. Thank God for flat irons though! I will definately be going back to the Dark &amp; Lovely relaxers. This relaxer was a serious waste of money.</li>
    <li> It had been quite a while since my last relaxer and for some odd reason I thought to give this a go. If I could turn back time...I normally use the kits for coarse hair and my scalp is usually fine. Oh boy did i burn, so bad that I thought I was finished. I thought I would need medical attention. I used all the neutraliser, the burn was immense. The real problem was when I started the post relaxer conditioning and styling. Clumps fell out, I was in shock as my hair fell out. I&#x27;m still in shock because its still falling out, it&#x27;s been over a month. I am bracing myself for a trip to the salon when they will advise of the inevitable...start again. Do not buy or stock this product please!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this a few days ago and just used it today.  It did burn a little, but nothing too crazy.  I did take a lil longer than i should to smooth it all out, but by no means was it seriously burning my scalp.  I have sebhorrea and my hair is recovering from a dry bout since I have to wash my hair/scalp frequently to keep it on my head.  I am very happy with the results.  I used every product in the box (i never do that) and my hair is super straight, doesnt feel oily (i hate oily weighed down hair)&lt;br /&gt;I previously used dr. bronners and after about a month my hair is super dry and brittle my scalp super itchy.  Before that I used ultrasheen ultra care relaxer as my hair liked it alot and my relaxed state lasted for a very long time and never converted to a dry/brittle state, but i think it may be discontinued.  SO! Im on the hunt for something comparable and so far i&#x27;m liking this one.  I&#x27;ll update after a while whether or not its causing my hair to fall out or some other atrocity... like most boxed relaxers do...</li>
    <li> I used this product last night. After losing so much of my hair and the incredible amount of burning, I turned to the internet to see what I could have done wrong. I am shocked to see reviews on several sites that all say the same thing: women who have successfully permed at home for years are being  seriously burned by this product.....It is thee worst kind of painful ladies (I wish there were words to describe). I was calling on Jesus as I rinsed. And seriously, it took out about a handful of my hair from the root. Only wish Amazon let you give zero stars.</li>
    <li> Been natural over a year and decided to return to a relaxer. Well...now I am sitting here with under processed hair. Smoothed my roots...but my ends are still curly. Bowed dryed my hair and its sooo stiff and damaged. I assumed because this product was same as Optimum Care I would have got even more beautiful results...epic fail!!! I didn&#x27;t lose any hair like most...but what I&#x27;m left with I&#x27;m contemplating another BC. Smh don&#x27;t waste your money for this load of crap...</li>
    <li> I wish I could give this less than one star. It took my hair out on the sides!</li>
    <li> My mom was crying because her hair fell out !!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This product will make your hair fall out. I only had it on for about 10 min and my hair was breaking off in chunks. Whatever is left on my head is soo damaged I feel like it all needs to be cut off. A class action lawsuit should be filed.</li>
    <li> Do not use!!!! Usually when I use relaxers it&#x27;s to loosen the curl I have. This relaxer is like pure lye!!!!! I have a short hair cut, took only 6 minutes to apply and immediately my scalp was burning so bad I was in tears! My bathroom to my kitchen sink is literally 20ft, I had to put the water to the coldest setting to get relief. Thank God I&#x27;m a hair stylist and know what to do to repair my hair!!!! This is the worst product Optimum has ever put our. The relaxers before were good but this one is trash. The alma styling products are good but the relaxer.....TERRIBLE</li>
    <li> OMG, my head was burnnnnning and is still hurting right now!!! It hurt so, so, so bad UTILL I just can&#x27;t express the PAIN but I can say, labor pains was nothing compared to Soft Sheen Carson Optimum Amla legend (in the teal box)! I have had my hair permed before and been around many other women who have had there hair permed but I have NEVER experienced ANYTHING like this. It was so bad until after  neutralizing, washing &amp; conditioning I grabbed my phone to check the internet for reviews and what horrible reviews; I&#x27;m writing this with my head wet rolled and under the dryer and it feels as if it is bleeding. Do Not Buy!  Please,Please Do NOT Buy this product cause something is dreadfully wrong with it.</li>
    <li> Finally a product that does what it says. It&#x27;s been a week since I&#x27;ve used it and my hair is sooo soft, curls are bouncy and no shedding ! Did not burn my scalp either.</li>
    <li> Awful. It started burning as I was applying i had to wash my hair immediately in cold water. DO Not Buy it. They should take it off the shelves!!! Not happy as I feel some parts of my hair are stucked  down to my scalp</li>
    <li> I do not have great hair and after using the product my hair felt healthy and thick, most importantly it was straight. No fall outs, minimal burns...</li>
    <li> Okay people.......I have been using Optimum Regular strength relaxer for many, many years. Stopped by Walmart yesterday and decided to purchase Amla Legend because my laziness liked the no mix aspect of it.  Before applying, I decided to read the trusted reviews on Amazon and I was horrified!  I have  long, thick but somewhat fine hair so without a doubt, I knew I would end up bald. I decided I would return it in the morning and exchange it for my oldie but goodie. When morning arrived, again, my LAZINESS took over and I applied it anyway.  I did not experience ANY BURNING whatsoever nor did I have any hair loss.  I could tell immediately that this relaxer was more nourishing and I would be pleased with the results. I did not leave it in long at all because  the negative reviews had me nervous!  My hair is soft, straight and silky and I would highly recommend it.  Will definitely purchase Amla Legend again!!!</li>
    <li> PLEASE PLEASE  PLEASE DO NOT BUT THIS PRODUCT WILL MAKE YOUR HAIR FALL OUT!!!! I HAVE BEEN DOING RELAXERS IN MY HAIR FOR YEARS I STOPPED FOR ABOUT TWO YEARS AND DECIDED JUST TO TOUCH UP MY ROOTS A BIT. NEVER IN LIFE HAS A RELAXER MADE MY HAIR FALL OUT NEVER. MY HAIR IS NOT COARSE HAIR BUT IT DOES GET REALLY TIGHT CURLS IN THE MIDDLE SO TO SOFTEN UP THE CURLS I WILL PUT A RELAXER IN. THIS SPECIFIC RELAXER BURNED LIKE CRAZY AFTER THE FIRST MINUTE I THOUGHT MAYBE SINCE ITS BEEN TWO YEARS OF MY LAST APPLICATION THATS WHY. BUT MAN WAS I WRONG!!!. ONCE I SEEN MY HAIR COMING OUT I FREAKED I ALMOST LOST IT AND WAS ALMOST IN TEARS. LUCKILY I STARTING PRAYING THE LORD HAD MERCY AND AFTER I TOWEL DRIED IT SORT OF STOPPED BUT SMALL INDIVIDUAL STRANDS KEPT COMING OUT. I IMMEDIATLY APLLIED COCONUT CREAM DEEP CONDITIONER AND A MARROCAN OIL DEEP CONDITIONER AS WELL BOTH AT THE SAME TIME AND NOW THROUGH OUT THE DAY I CONTINUE TO APPLY THEM. I PRAY THAT TOMORROW MY HAIR IS WITH MUCH MORE STRENGTH SINCE I PLAN ON LEAVING THE DEEP CONDITIONERS IN TILL TOMORROW. I TRULY THANK GOD THAT I HAVE NO BALD SPOTS BUT I WENT THROUGH A TERRIBLE SCARE AND IM STILL SCARED HONESTLY. I WAS SO MORTIFIED I HAD TO CALL MY MOM SHE SAID MY HAIR IS NOT GOING TO FALL OUT AS MUCH AS IT DID WHEN I FIRST WASHED OUT THE EVIL RELAXER BUT THAT I DO HAVE TO PUT IN DEEP CONDITIONERS AND BUY SOME TYPE OF FORTIFYING PRODUCT THAT WILL STREGTHEN MY SCALP. IM GONNA TRY AND BUY PENETREX FROM SEBASTIAN MY MOM RECOMMENDED IT THEY USE THIS ALOT WHERE WE ARE FROM IN THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC SO IM GONNA TRY AND ORDER IT FROM AMAZON SINCE I DONT FIND IT HERE IN THE STORES . PLEASE BEAUTIFUL LADIES DO LOTS OF RESEARCH BEFORE APPLYING ANY TYPE OF RELAXER OR ANY TYPE OF KERATIN OR CHEMICAL ANYTHING AT ALL AND YOU KNOW WHAT IF YOU HAVE TO JUST DEPEND ON DEEP CONDITIONERS AND HAIR MASKS TO HAVE BEAUTIFUL SHINY HAIR THEN DO SO BEACUASE THIS IS WHY I WENT TWO YEARS WITHOUT A RELAXER I WAS AFRIAD OF HAIR FALLING OUT BUT GUESS WHAT MY NIGHTMARE BECAME REALITY. MAY GOD BLESS YOU GUYS AND IM SORRY FOR THIS VERY LONG POST I NEVER LEAVE REVIEWS BUT I HOPE I HELPED SOMEONE OUT THERE AND FOR THOSE THAT DON&#x27;T BUY ONLINE PLEASE SPREADTHE WORD TO YOUR SISTERS AND COUSINS BECAUSE THEY SERIOUSLY NEED TO TAKE THIS PRODUCT OFF THE SHELVES NOW.</li>
    <li> My aunt used this product for the first time and she immediately complained of burning so she washed it out without smoothing. Her hair was falling out as she neutralized. I immediately stepped in the to help her. Used all the neutralizer included in the box and more of what we had already. Applied egg and later deep conditioned minutes later to stop it. No luck. she has three quarter size bad spots in the back and crown area of her head! Her long hair is destroyed. It&#x27;s been several months since she relaxed prior to using this product and there were no other chemicals!!! DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT. She does not have a sensitive scalp and she don&#x27;t scratch so there&#x27;s no reason this relaxer should have burned as it did so quickly!!! After relaxing own hair over 20 years between visits to the salon this has never happen!!! I do no recommend this product!!!! Stick to what you know. Any relaxer that&#x27;s for all hair types is not a safe relaxer I learned!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Signed,&lt;br /&gt;A ziplock full of hair</li>
    <li> i used this relaxer product without the benefit of seeing these reviews.  My hair is coarse and very full.  My hair starting falling out in clumps before the smoothing began.  I am going to have to chop off most of my hair shoulder length to recover from the damage done by this product.</li>
    <li> ok if zero stars was an option that would be my rating. I put it in my hair at 12 pm it is now 10pm and its still burning. and yes I washed every ounce of the relaxer out it just sucks! BEWARE IF U&lt;br /&gt;WANT UR HAIR! burns the second u put it on. smh im just so pissed im done with the review please dnt buy this CRAP</li>
    <li> I did not purchase from Amazon site, but from local drug store. Hair fell out daily in clumps, to the point that I had no choice but to do the Big Chop.Horrible experience. Please, there are so many other options......so if you are looking to try something new, skip over this one... if you value your hair.</li>
    <li> As a person who has permed her hair for years and still maintained to have strong, long, and healthy hair, I&#x27;m trying to tell everyone that I can who is considering using this perm NOT to do it. You will regret it. This needs to be taken off of the shelves. I don&#x27;t know what is in this product but the long healthy hair I had is now short, dried out, and balding because of trying out this particular perm. There are some people that I know that have used this perm only once and their hair fell out so badly that they are now wearing wigs due to the damage this perm caused. No perm has ever done me like this before. Ever! Stay away from it and stick with products that you know about. This perm is very deadly. I hope this review saves someone&#x27;s hair. Wished I would&#x27;ve read some reviews about this perm before buying it at the store; however, I couldn&#x27;t find any reviews at the time about this perm. Seriously, Do Not Buy This Perm!</li>
    <li> I tried this product along with my daughter and it started to burn immediately.  I&#x27;ve been using the original relaxer for years and decided to try this one since mixing was not needed.  Big mistakes, had sores and hair stuck to scalp.  Will never buy this product again.</li>
    <li> My grandmother and I used this product and it made our hair dry like fiber. My hair was dry before but now it&#x27;s falling out now. Optimum anti-breakage therapy relaxer is a good product,  so I didn&#x27;t think twice about buying Optimum Amla. Usually when I use anti- breakage therapy my hair feels less dry and heathier. I experienced the opposite results with Amla. Now my hair is coming out in clumps and the hair is extremely dry.</li>
    <li> Burns!!!!!! Do not use this, i literally had to was out within 5mins of putting it in because it burned so bad!!!&lt;br /&gt;use ors olive oil or something else because this is making my hair fall out!!!</li>
    <li> Do not use this relaxer. I usually use the Olive Oil brand relaxer, which has worked well for me for years. Most recently i tried Alma Legend because the store was put of my usual. So much of my hair came out on both temples, the front of my hairline, and in the crown. I followed the directions and used a timer. I have thick strong hair and have NEVER had a negative reaction to relaxers. This experience has caused me to decide to grow out my relaxer and go through the stages of going natural. Im too scared to even put the chemical on my hair again!</li>
    <li> This review is somewhat up and down.  Did I get the desired results? Yes I did.  My hair feels incredibly mositurized and it&#x27;s very straight.  Most relaxers tame my hair but few are capable of getting it all the way straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that&#x27;s the good part of the review.  The bad - I was incredibly shocked by how bad this relaxed burned.  Luckily so far I have not had any breakage.  In fact I had little to no hair on my comb during the detangling process.  I&#x27;m afraid however that if I had not been lucky enough to apply vasilene on top of the relaxers protectant gel I too would be giving a one star review detailing my hair falling out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product should definitely come with a warning.  But I plan to use again now that I know how to apply it.  Will be greasing my scalp abundantly before the next application.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the worst relaxer product on the market!  I had a beautiful grade of hair, very healthy, &amp; long.I was so proud of my hair until I decided to use this product for a touch up.As I rinsed the relaxer from my hair, I opened my eye because my hair seemed to be thinner on my head.Upon doing that ,I noticed that my hair was just flowing down the drain! So much so that the drain stopped up due to the hair loss!! One would have thought that I had undergone Chemo treatment.After rinsing, my hair came out by the handful! This process went on for a month! Finally after the use of Aphogee products, Carol&#x27;s Daughter Monoi line,&amp; Lee Stafford products my hair is on the mend.It took about 2 months for me to go to a salon for coloring &amp; trimming of my ends.I will be suing Sof Sheen Carson regarding the product liability that they have for marketing this horrible destructive product!</li>
    <li> I have not used this product yet, but I do have it and after I read the reviews, I am not putting this stuff on my head.  I noticed that this product has no strength listed, (e.g., regular, super).  It does state that it is for all hair types,  BUT, IF YOU LOOK AT SIDE OF THE BOX WHERE IT SAYS;  IMPORTANT - READ BEFORE PURCHASING IT SAYS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34; This product may not be suitable for all hair types, a strand test must be performed prior to application.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too many women have lost their hair and burned their scalp from this product.  I suggest that these women go to a health food store, get some pure Amla oil or Argon oil and start bringing their scalp and hair back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, should Carson be sued  or should we read more carefully or both?.  I am going back to the Olive Oil relaxer, regular strength and keep my hair.  What will I do with this box?  Chalk it up to a loss of money.  Better losing money, than losing my hair and scalp.</li>
    <li> Welll ive been relaxing my hair since i was little and ive tried it all,  this product is very strong but it works if you know how to manage it. What my stylist did is that she aplied it with my hair dirty and put vaseline on the ends and parts that didnt need to be relaxed and then she applied it.  If you scratch your scalp before  you apply it it will burn your soul.  In my case it did burn a little but nothing unusual.  I do recommend it, it dosnt smel, my hair was very soft and shiny. I LOVED IT.</li>
    <li> DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!!! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED &gt;&gt;It will BURN and make you cry. It feels like a FOREST FIRE in your hair.  My daughter had this in her hair less than 10 minutes and was crying and racing upstairs to rinse the relaxer out. I&#x27;ve been putting relaxers in her hair for years and NEVER had a reaction like this before.  NEW is NOT always better.  This product is not for anyone.  Please pass this on to everyone you know, especially since this is EASTER Weekend.</li>
