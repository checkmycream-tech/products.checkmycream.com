<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have very dry feet with thick cracking skin.  This helps to remove the dead skin and leave them smooth.  Even when I would soak my feet and scrub them with the PedEgg they would be rough.</li>
    <li> I love this product. got it today. I was waiting for this product cause I heard so much about it . and  finally I brought my feets back to life with this product. this product is awesome. I think I could feel movement in my pinky toes now  lol.</li>
    <li> I really like it . It works better than I thought it would.</li>
    <li> This product works perfect. My boyfriend approves of it.</li>
    <li> Awful. Had to return it.  The thing would not stay on.  It also had a burning smell and hurt when I tried to use it.</li>
    <li> I loved this little thing. I had pedegg and it was such a hard job grating the junk out of my soles. This one feels like it is not working (no pain, you see?!) but dont be fooled. It does. You will soon see a mountain of dust on the fooor. Wont ever live without this</li>
    <li> But, the wheels get dull VERY fast. It does kick ass on pesky funky thick  heels and palms. YES I said PALMS! I have a bad case of eczema and was tired of that horrible feeling of catching on everything, especially satin jammies. So, I did it and it WORKED! Just dont go overboard, you will know when lotion/soap hits your hands, TRUST ME! But its sooo worth it to have soft hands and feet. Have to buy more wheels because this is so worth the price of them. And use VERY GOOD batteries. (Sorry, no store brand) I use ENELOOP rechargeable batteries and this thing MOVES! Trust me, invest in them and the charger and they will pay for themselves in a couple weeks. You need the power of a good battery or why bother?</li>
    <li> This product is terrible. Amazon should screen these things out.</li>
    <li> dosent have enough power.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this product!  It got rid of the calluses on my feet.  They are really smooth now.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am impressed with this little callus remover.  It did much better than I expected.  I would recommend this to anyone who has calluses.</li>
    <li> omg this worked instantly, the hard dead skin on my feet was immediately removed, and it came with 3 other heads. Thank you i feel like i bought the perfect gift for myself</li>
    <li> I love this...wish I had seen this year&#x27;s ago.  This works fabulously and is SO easy and convenient...I have never found anything that works as great and takes no effort.  My compliments and gratitude to the designer and the selling company.</li>
    <li> Short battery life. .</li>
    <li> Perfect grooming tool</li>
    <li> This thing is wonderful.  I use it on all my dry skin it works like a top!</li>
    <li> Like to use it very much, but some time could not reach to the hollow point on the side of the foot. Still wish I bought it long time ago.</li>
    <li> Extremely weak and mostly ineffective. I used as directed on clean dry skin and while my healthy skin was slightly smoother my calluses remained exactly the same. I went through one course and one extra course roller per foot before they were ruined. I don&#x27;t do manual labor, I get a few pedicured a year so it&#x27;s not like it was a tough job.  I ended up returning it for a similar product.</li>
    <li> maybe my callus is deep or something.. but this did not completely remove it.  It did help with the pain so it keeps me using it every few days.  I guess i had different expectations.</li>
    <li> Works well. I know some reviews say it bogs down, but that is only when I press too hard. It works great for a home pedi.</li>
    <li> Wow is all I can say. It is such an amazing product!!!! It does a fantastic job. It&#x27;s the best of both worlds its tough but not too harsh. It really gets the job done. Give it a try you can&#x27;t beat the price you will not disappointed.</li>
    <li> The iVog Pedi-Luv works great! It is by far one of my best purchases on Amazon, and I can&#x27;t believe it only had one review when I ordered it. It is simply amazing! I could not believe how much better it worked than the other product I had been using. It is lightweight, powerful but gentle. My heels are now extremely smooth and look great. I&#x27;m in love with the Pedi-Luv, lol. The only con to this product is that it works so well that it leaves a bit of a mess on the floor; however, I&#x27;ll take the mess to have smooth heels! I expected to have to use the extra coarse attachment to get good results, but I was able to use the attachment that comes pre-installed. You barely have to touch your feet to see immediate, effortless and incredible results. If your looking for an inexpensive way to pamper your feet, buy this item. You will not be sorry.</li>
    <li> It works! Not only was this model less expensive, it came with extra rollers. Very pleased. The feet weren&#x27;t looking great after a summer of sandals, and the folks at the pedicure place do their best, but it just doesn&#x27;t last. Thank you iVog.</li>
    <li> has no power, doesn&#x27;t remove paint on skin let alone callus&#x27;</li>
    <li> If you have deep calluses it may take a while to smooth them out the way you want. It took me an hour to get a bad one on my left foot. It worked and now to make sure it doesn&#x27;t get that bad, I need to stay on top of it every week. For heels and other small calluses it work great. It is safe and I would tell my friends (who need something like this) to purchase this item.</li>
    <li> I am so pleased i bought this item - it has really sorted my hard skin out!  I had such hard skin it caught in everything, so am pleased to have got rid of it.  Unlike a cream or lotion, this will always be at hand to do some maintenance work!!  Really worth the money - much cheaper than a lot of creams on the market. Would recommend to anyone to try for themselves - so little for such an effective little gadget.</li>
    <li> This is the most awesome callous remover I have even tried and I have tried a lot! You cannot cut your feet with this one. It&#x27;s fast, efficient, and safe. My feet never felt so smooth and soft before. I cannot say enough about this product except to say it is magnifucient and has completely replaced my semi-monthly professional pedicures. I highly recommend this item!!!</li>
    <li> Worse than an emory board.  Total waste of money.</li>
    <li> We tried &amp;#34; THE OTHER ONE &amp;#34; , I have to say not a fan. This one I purchased for my husband . Severe calluses on his hands from brick work for more than 40 years, I put in the 3 AAA batteries , my husband used the blue coarse roller , less the 15 minutes and those aged old calluses are gone.&lt;br /&gt;This callus remover comes with one extra blue coarse roller and two extra coarse rollers that are grey. There is also a blue roller already in the pedi-luv. When my husbsnd was finished using it, I simply took a dry firm toothbrush and cleanedvthe roller. I alwwys keep our old toothbrushes for small tasks around the house. My husband is diabetic and I&#x27;m always worried about his feet being dry . He used this on his feet as well as he can&#x27;t say enough about how much better his feet feel . I used it on my feet , using very little pressure against your dry skin and I can only say just try it. If you press against your skin dry skin, the roller will turn slowly if at all.&lt;br /&gt;There is a little button in the center of the on/off switch, pushing the little button in while pushing the main button up turns on the pedi-luv. There are 2 speeds normal speed and faster by pushing button up . Don&#x27;t use this on wet skin or skin that has lotion, creams or oils on it. The pedi-luv comes with a clear cap that just snaps on. I am ordering one for myself , my husband doesn&#x27;t like to share.&lt;br /&gt;The other brand I purchased lasted us almost a month before quitting. We returned it for a refund. The roller is pretty easy to change as well.There is a small blue release button on the side. Iwill be giving a UPDATE after a few months using this.  👣  THANKS FOR READING, BYE.👣</li>
    <li> This machine is wonderful. I recommend it to everybody.</li>
    <li> No stars! This is so pathetically weak, don&#x27;t bother with it! I did not want to give it that star!</li>
    <li> Works well. Not real powerful but has helped tremendously</li>
    <li> Hi,got items,Thank you</li>
    <li> I am really confused at the positive reviews on this product. First of all, for the minute it even worked it had zero power. If you press too hard the machine stops. However this would barely GRAZE my skin and would stop every second. It was so unbelievably frustrating. However, the worst part was that within a minute of use and with brand new 3 energizer batteries, I heard a loud pop. Battery acid started to leak out the back of the case all over my hands. I&#x27;m out my three batteries and left with the hassle of returning and frustration of this piece of junk. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND TIME!</li>
    <li> It works wonders we love it!!!</li>
    <li> Okay.... lemme just say... I LOVE this thing!&lt;br /&gt;Since my preferred footwear is to wear no footwear at all....&lt;br /&gt;I tend to have very rough, dry, calloused feet :(&lt;br /&gt;Before this handy dandy lil device, I could walk barefoot over sharp gravel, hot sand and cement, and probably broken glass and fiery coals and not be affected in the least. (the last two I never actually tested... but I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s fact.)&lt;br /&gt;But....&lt;br /&gt;After using this thing....&lt;br /&gt;My feet are BABY soft!!!&lt;br /&gt;NEVER have they felt this nice!&lt;br /&gt;Not even after a pedicure!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now have delicate girly feet :3&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Ivog!</li>
    <li> It is great. I couldn&#x27;t believe how well this works. Just one down side. batteries AAA. they run out really fast. I don&#x27;t like to create garbage and damage the environment, so all this battery consumption worries me.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, just received this today and my feet already feel a lot smoother!</li>
    <li> removes dry skin well</li>
    <li> This is easy to use. Love that it comes with extra rollers. Very good product that works as advertised. Will probably order more of these as gifts.</li>
    <li> Love this product. The rollers only last one use. It helps me keep my feet smooth between pedicures!</li>
    <li> Works surprisingly good given that it runs on  batteries.  Does the job! Comes with plenty of xtras.</li>
    <li> Works really well. Pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> This callus remover is slow, and if it get too close to the heel, it hesitates.I found the on/off switch hard to operate and it does not have multiple speeds. I wanted to return, but think I have to pay postage.  Would not recommend.  Check Walgreens and other sources for a more powerful one.</li>
    <li> Product is&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful! I have a deformity which causes callousness on the outside of my foot. After one use  it greatly improved, arrived quickly&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> Wow! I don&#x27;t know why I never looked for a product like this before! I think I was born with calluses. I can&#x27;t speak to those whose feet are already soft, but if you have an issue with thick heels, this is your product. I have used it on the softer part of my feet, and the worst sensation was a slight tickle. I&#x27;m ticklish. If you do push too hard, it stops itself. The best part of this is that I can attack all areas easily and I don&#x27;t get too tired of filing back and forth to what seems to be no avail. And, you can stand over the trash can and have filings drop down, rather than flying all over. Thank you, whoever invented this!</li>
    <li> This callus remover works really well.  It takes a light touch and my feet are nice and smooth!</li>
    <li> WIFE HAS TRIED MOST PEDICURE DEVICES SOLD AND THIS ONE IS THE BEST AND AN INSTANT FAVORITE FOR HER</li>
    <li> So amazing!  Buy this!</li>
    <li> This works perfectly! It&#x27;s easy to use and fast. It makes it easy to keep ugly callouses in check. I love it!</li>
    <li> Product does not work it has no power.</li>
    <li> Not only callus&#x27; but also trims my toe nails..... as a diabetic I&#x27;m sorry I spent so much time waiting in the podiatrist office....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Girlfriend loves it too.....plenty of power unless you expect to do body work on your ford truck</li>
    <li> I still use this and it&#x27;s okay... better than a lot of the dead skin removers out there... But it&#x27;s still not powerful enough. I think it has the right idea and would like to see one more powerful. After having it for several months, every time I use it I seem to think the batteries are running out and replace them. But that&#x27;s not really the issue. It just needs to be stronger. Still looking for some other more powerful product.</li>
    <li> Awesome! I loved it, it really works! I tried so many things to get my heels like baby skin, but nothing worked. This was really good and worked perfectly! You need to apply very little pressure though, otherwise it won&#x27;t work! I saw reviews of people complaining about this products not working fine because they pressed against ther skin, don&#x27;t do this!</li>
    <li> Used Three times it wont work</li>
