<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i just bought a set of these and they are really amazing :D!! equipped with a fine point u can really use these to create intricate designs or whatever else ur heart desires ~~ i LOVE them!!! thank you :)</li>
    <li> Bought for stocking stuffers. Everyone liked them.</li>
    <li> Tips aren&#x27;t as precise as I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> The polish was way too thick and gummy. I was disappointed as I own a set of these pens from another company and they are FANTASTIC! If you want really good quality ones ( and excellent customer service) buy the ones from Bits and Pieces. These still work, but not great quality polish.</li>
    <li> Christmas present for daughter.  Didn&#x27;t give 5 stars as has not been used yet.  Seems good for price.</li>
    <li> Got here quick and was as expected.</li>
    <li> My 11 year old is crazy about these  pens!  They are easy and fun to use and work very well.  I only gave 4 stars because the tip of the black pen broke off after two uses.  To get another black pen I need to purchase and entire set.  I wish they would sell the pens individually.</li>
    <li> Granddaughter loves them</li>
    <li> Too bad the black and blue pens just didn&#x27;t work for me at all. Not sure how to fix that. Otherwise, the pens are okay. There is a bit of a learning curve in squeezing the polish out evenly if you want to draw a line for instance.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. They are fun but I prefer my detail brush as it&#x27;s easier to control the amount of paint. With these it&#x27;s just to hard to get a real even line. They are fun though. I still use them for dots and anything that isn&#x27;t real detailed.</li>
    <li> I really liked the product.  Colors were bright and beautiful</li>
    <li> The first day I even used it and it already broke. The needles were the nail polish comes out break easily, there&#x27;s hardly any nail polish in the pens to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;Cheap product that doesn&#x27;t even last!</li>
    <li> So far these pens work great! No clogged pens yet, we just wipe them after every use. But so far they are very easy to use and my daughter loves them. Great but!</li>
    <li> Does not go on smooth as a polish, only really useful as a decorating pen but they clog a lot when using the pen side too. I would not buy these again.</li>
    <li> The nail polish works great and the designs don&#x27;t chip off. This product makes nail designs super easy and I would recommend it over the long brushes.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 3 daughters (and myself )  We love it!  We are having so much fun drawing things on our nails.  Its easy to use and we are getting so many compliments on our nails that people are getting them for themselves.</li>
    <li> great works really and lasts!</li>
    <li> Gift for my 9 year old niece.  She liked it but may be a better gift for a teenaged girl.</li>
    <li> Two of the nail polishes didn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use and very fun.  It takes a long time to dry if you aren&#x27;t careful to put it on very sparingly.  Takes practice.</li>
    <li> Amazing capacity for details. Comes with great description, tips for care and use, and a practice booklet to try out designs on paper and avoid messing up your nail art. Love love love. Would recommend to anyone who likes nail art and wants to be able to incorporate tiny details.</li>
    <li> i had bought this as a gift for someone who really&lt;br /&gt;like this product</li>
    <li> These nail art pens were purchased as a Christmas gift and were a big hit.  We had seen them demonstrated twice and when I went looking for this product, I was very pleased to see them available at such a good price.  We will definitely consider purchasing them again.  The product was received in a very timely manner and in good shape.</li>
    <li> 2 of the pins didn&#x27;t work. They were broken.</li>
    <li> Apparently, giving one of these is a great way to score points with teenagers. They really seemed to enjoy these.</li>
    <li> My daughter in law found the applicators easy to use and was able to quickly apply to nails with colorful results.</li>
    <li> my daughter said they are kind of ok but not worth buying again&lt;br /&gt;they clogged a lot and one tip busted</li>
    <li> These work great!  My 13 year old had no problems using the nail pain pens.  We did not use the polish brush part of the item.</li>
    <li> It is very difficult to find high quality nail pens at retail shops, so I am so happy that we found these! My daughter &amp; her friends have spent hours doing nail art. The colors are great &amp; the pens work well. They don&#x27;t clog, clump, etc. I will be ordering more!</li>
    <li> The pens are great but colors are not what I expected. I don&#x27;t have white color in the collection. Unfortunately many designs need white. I have to buy it separately from other place.</li>
    <li> very disappointed. when I opened up the nail polish was real thick and I had to use paint thinner to be able to paint my nails. I was so excited to use since I have used this product before with no problem.</li>
    <li> Works just as pictured.  Easy to use. Polish dries quickly. Colors are true to picture.  My 7-yr-old can use it.</li>
    <li> Tips were clogged and didn&#x27;t work. Polish is chalky, not a good purchase</li>
    <li> A gift well received.</li>
    <li> My daughter and her friends are able to make simple but super cute designs with this easy to use set.</li>
    <li> I am pretty artistic with my nails, however, I bought these at the state fair and spent $25 on a 2 packages.  They aren&#x27;t very easy to use and I find myself using other means of designs and ended up just using the polish to mix with other bottles.</li>
    <li> Bought this item for my granddaughter, she is eight and loves doing her nails. She can make all kinds of design, and loves the colors.</li>
    <li> I wanted the Migi brand and thought this was it. The description and photo lead me to believe that it would be Migi product. What I received instead was Pinky Picasso which looks similar, but was not what I order. I&#x27;m disappointed that I had to pay for the shipping and now I&#x27;m paying for the return shipping too. Will not order from this Co. again.</li>
    <li> these are really good art pens. Still learning to use them.a la la la la la la la la la</li>
    <li> My daughter was using a stylus to do her three daughters nails. This will make her work much easier. Quick shipping and reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter loves it.</li>
    <li> I got this for my sister who has always loved to paint and draw. She loves it and has had a lot of fun coming up with creative designs for her nails. She says it is easy to use and not messy at all.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift for a teenager. You know haw teenagers are they either love it or hate it.  I was lucky, she loved it.&lt;br /&gt;She didn&#x27;t waste any time getting started.</li>
    <li> Bought this for granddaughter and she loved this.  Kept her busy and very happy.</li>
    <li> I bought the Migi Nail Art Polish for my 14 year old granddaughter.  She is pleased with the colors and ability to do art.  She made a flower on her fingernail soon after she opened the box.  Included with the polish is a small booklet with hints and design how-tos.</li>
    <li> My 8 year old Niece absolutely loved these.  Easy to hold and use.  She quickly made designs on everyone&#x27;s nails on Christmas day.  She bought a set for her friend so they could have nail design parties.</li>
    <li> My preteen granddaughters love these!  they are always decorating their fingers and toes!  Too cute!  Worth the money and good quality.</li>
    <li> I like these nail art pens.  The polish is VERY thick, which can be beneficial when using the detail part but quite useless for painting.  I wish the color choices were a bit better, they seem kind of outdated.</li>
    <li> YES!&lt;br /&gt;Finally something that will help me do some styling on my nails! I think it will take some practice to use. I realized you have to push the black portion in order to squeeze out the amount you want. Some of them the polish will come out on it&#x27;s own without having to squeeze. The only downside into using these nail pens is that you have to have an even amount come out at the same time if you&#x27;re going to draw a line. However, it&#x27;s awesome for dotting and snowflakes! It also duels as a normal nail polish as well so it is pretty convenient. It also comes with free 2 refills with 3.99 or lower for shipping.. so I guess it&#x27;s not technically &amp;#34;free.&amp;#34; Anyhow, I haven&#x27;t been able to use the full capacity but I&#x27;m happy with it so far.</li>
    <li> They are good some what but once the tip breaks you can&#x27;t use the color anymore was kinda pissed about that</li>
    <li> Surprisingly easy to use!  You simply draw on your nails like you are using colored pens, only its nail polish.</li>
    <li> my granddaughter loved it</li>
    <li> Got this for my niece for Christmas. She loved it and started using it right away. For me the odor was a little strong, but it went away pretty fast.</li>
    <li> I got all Migi pens set (25 pens in total) as a gift from a friend on 2011, I love nail art and these pens are so easy to use, the company even refill the polishes for free, you will need to pay only for the shipping which is around 4 dollars, I still havent refill them even when I regularly use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see no cons to these pens. This review its not about the seller, but the Migi Nail Art Pens instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you love cute designs on your nails, these Migi pens you definitely must buy!!!</li>
    <li> We picked these up at a county fair, maybe two years ago.  They&#x27;re fun, but the pen tips on several eventually clogged or broke, and once they&#x27;re broken that&#x27;s the end of the art.  The polishes thickened up, too, unlike polishes I have had for much longer.  My girls and I have gotten several fun designs out of these, however, and now I&#x27;m looking into other nail art options.</li>
    <li> I love this product, but it is pretty expensive. I wish there is a cheaper version of this product but I havent found any as good for a cheaper price. It will last a while though! and is super easy to use! lot of fun.</li>
    <li> THE PENS WERE JUST OK. THE BOX ARRIVED IN A MANILLA ENVELOPE AND WAS SMASHED AND TORN.  NOT EXACTLY HOW YOU WANT A GIFT TO LOOK.</li>
    <li> I need a little practice to use this... I think I am getting better as I use it more often. I have to be careful not to clog it by digging it in drying nail polish.</li>
    <li> Grandbaby was so thrilled !!!!  I love them it kept the girls busy all day polishing nails for all women who came to the house</li>
    <li> Nice, a little hard to open though.</li>
    <li> some if my pens dont work</li>
    <li> They are so thin and neat to apply.  I would buy them in all the colors.&lt;br /&gt;They are easy to use.</li>
    <li> Bought it for a Christmas gift for a friend that loves to make designs on her nails.  I personally go to a nail salon and get them done.  Ever since we exchanged gifts she has a different design every 2 weeks and she said it is so much easier to do a design with.</li>
    <li> I USE THIS WITH MY NIECE AND SHE LOVES IT! ITS A QUICK AND CHEAPER WAY TO ADD TO YOUR NAILS</li>
    <li> These items have two ends, and you can&#x27;t put them down on the table when you are painting because the ends are rounded.</li>
    <li> The pre teens I bought this for say they really loved it, the polish went on smooth and pens worked well!</li>
    <li> When I first received these pens, I was THRILLED. Using them was great in the beginning. They began to spew when I uncapped them, but I assumed it was because they were all shook up. But even as i kept them upright, they would still spew and become hard to manage when using. The polish&#x27;s quality is pretty good, but something needs to be done about the leaky-ness.</li>
    <li> Granddaughter had a blast with this!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my 7 yr old daughter. She loves them but I do too!! They are a lot of fun and SO easy to use. I can&#x27;t wait to order refills in different colors. We have had a lot of fun with very little messes. Highly highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I bought these pens for my twelve year old neice.  She loved them.  She read the directions herself and was able to use the pens to make her own designes.</li>
    <li> When I ordered this product, I thought it was just nail polish pens. I was pleasantly surprised when I discovered they also had brushes. I know the description said pen-brushes but it didn&#x27;t click with me until I got them and started using them. I&#x27;m slowly getting better with them and I look forward to getting even better! The colors are great an  the pens are easy to use once get a feel for how much pressure to apply to the tube to yield the desired result. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to try nail designs with higher difficulty, or a great way to do lettering an  numbering.</li>
    <li> It is a gift.  It looks OK.</li>
    <li> Great, arrived on time and packed well. My daughter loves it. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I bought this set for my granddaughter, and even at 9 years of age, she did a very good job, so the pens are easy to use.  She love it.</li>
    <li> I love them!!! The quality is good, the brush tip is the perfect size, and the dotting tip is great. The only thing is I didn&#x27;t receive the colors in the picture, and instead got black, white, a navy blue, an orangey/coral, a lime glittery green, yellow, and a deep red. I still love them though!!</li>
    <li> Gave these to my 11 year old .granddaughter, she and her friends have a lot of fun with them. They are easy to use and not messy.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter likes that they are refillable.</li>
    <li> I did not personally see the product.  It was a gift for my granddaughter.  She loved it.  Thank you for getting it to her promptly.</li>
    <li> Not as smooth as shown on video</li>
    <li> The box of nail art polish arrived when promised and looks like the ad.  Since these are Christmas gifts, I will have to wait until after Christmas to see if the quality matches the product.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my granddaughters and they love them,</li>
    <li> great gift, happy kid, shame it came a week after xmas and was ordered in the beginning of december.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my daughter, who is 11, and she&#x27;s had a lot of fun with it.  It&#x27;s been great to have around for all the snow days we&#x27;ve had.  The polish dispenses smoothly and wears well.  The colors are nicely opaque and brightly colored.</li>
    <li> Fun to use.  My 8 year old granddaughter painted my nails...such a good time.  Beware not to bend the wires when putting a top back on!!!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with my set. Everything was marked nail candy and my blue was not blue.  It came out straight purple!. It seemed alot cheaper In quality than my original migi set.</li>
    <li> Came Fast, just the product I wanted and didn&#x27;t have to go looking for it.&lt;br /&gt;Grand Kids will love it.</li>
    <li> This was given to our 10 year old granddaughter for Christmas.  She loves doing nails - this was a great artistic extra for her collection.</li>
    <li> Browsing brought  me to this great set for my granddaughter! The best thing about it, and one that I not able to find in any store, were the dual brushes that allow for regular or &amp;#34;fine-tipped&amp;#34; designs!</li>
    <li> Given as a gift, and they loved it. I would recommend to anyone who has daughters, nieces, wives, that paint their nails.</li>
    <li> My 14yo daughter has really enjoyed this set I got her for Christmas. She says it is simple to use and fun to create designs on her nails. She has not had any trouble with leaking or clogging of pens. Love the option of free refills down the road.</li>
    <li> daughter said she liked it a lot</li>
    <li> These pens are awesome.  My daughter recently got into nail art and this makes her creations perfect.  would love to see additional colors</li>
    <li> try to find this somewhere cheaper.  its a boring little gift in a boring little box.  i gave it as a gift/dont know if it works.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter loved it, she also changed her nail design every day!.</li>
    <li> Intended for two of our granddaughters, this went viral (within our home) in a manner of moments.  They were upstairs planning their next creation.  Personally, I&#x27;d never give it much thought.  Within 20 minutes, they gave it much thought.  Pretty cool, and pretty much as I hoped it would be.</li>
    <li> Colors are great.  Giving it to my Granddaughter, I think she will love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gave a set to my other Granddaughter, but havn&#x27;t heard yet.</li>
    <li> As a greeny, I don&#x27;t use nailpolish often - make that at all.  But one thing that I have not given up on is my signature art that I put on my big toe.  It is so easy to apply with these pens, and the polish holds up nicely.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved them.</li>
    <li> We have gotten these before and my daughter used them all.&lt;br /&gt;They are great!  All the different colors and a good price.</li>
    <li> This is a lower quality product. The polish is a bit thick. When they arrived, one of the polish brushes came out of the tube at a 90° angle. So, using the brush with that color is out of the question. The pen tip sides work very well. I&#x27;d recommend them for an adolescent age. Thankfully I bought this set for an 11 year old. They are working well for her.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my 10 year old daughter for christmas.  We used them once and the pens began clogging up.  If you pressed too hard - the pens actually bend or break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Such a disapointment.</li>
    <li> These pens are amazing, you can easily draw designs with them, it&#x27;s so much fun, I can finally do professional designs at home. You can even open it and refill it with whatever color you want, apart from the pen tips that come with it, it also has a paintbrush included like any normal nail polish which is a plus. The only reason why I gave it a 4 star is because the pink colour does not look pink it looks more like a translucent pink nail base.</li>
    <li> 10 year olds loved it at their slumber party</li>
    <li> Gave as a gift and she LOVED IT!!!</li>
    <li> I got t&lt;br /&gt;Hese for my daughter and niece. They both are enjoying using them and I am glad I got them.</li>
    <li> Takes a little practice to do some of the designs but my daughter uses them all the time now!  Make sure not to loose the little cleaning pin included in the kit.</li>
