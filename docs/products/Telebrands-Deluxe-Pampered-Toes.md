      <li>Telebrands Deluxe Pampered Toes is another product that delivers what it says.</li>
      <li>Kind of felt it was helping</li>
      <li>the kind you use to space your toes for a pedicure.  </li>
      <li>the kind that I would have to be sure to keep clean, so I was very GLAD when the material was durable and not \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; at all!</li>
      <li>The best option is to just go ahead and pay more for the real deal as this and</li>
      <li>My feet are a size 8.5 in US Women&#x27;s, and they fit perfectly, providing just the right amount of stretch for my feet.</li>
      <li>I was unsure if anything like this would even be effective, so I didn&#x27;t want to invest in the more costly product.</li>
      <li>Telebrands Deluxe Pampered Toes are an interesting idea that can help your feet if they are sore.</li>
      <li>A more eco-friendly container that you can even use to store the pads in would be a nice upgrade to the</li>
      <li>Okay product and nicely made.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t really see that as a good thing!</li>
      <li>They are very comfortable</li>
      <li>But the gel material is nice and cool on my sore feet!</li>
      <li>Good value product.&lt;br /&gt;Received reasonably quickly and works as expected.&lt;br /&gt;Hard</li>
      <li>before you put them on because you are not going to be able to walk once they are on</li>
      <li>It also looked it took more effort than I thought it would to put on.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m on my feet for 8-11 hours a day, so the pain would become more than an annoyance.</li>
      <li>Love putting these on after a hardwork out or being on my feet all day.</li>
      <li>I did some more thinking...</li>
      <li>I love this invention.</li>
      <li>The soothing effect comes when you fix your feet and maybe choose better shoes that support a healthy foot, and you start to feel better.      </li>
      <li>it would be all the better.</li>
      <li>I really love these.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll be so pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>That said, I found that after using the, as directed for the better part of two weeks that they made no difference whatsoever.</li>
      <li>Love it..</li>
      <li>If it was more durable</li>
      <li>I was sure this was a gimmick or a fad</li>
      <li>I have better alignment.</li>
      <li>but the skin (between my toes) feels better.</li>
      <li>I did not and returning them would cost more than keeping them.      </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad someone invented this.</li>
      <li>I have more balance in my yoga practice.</li>
      <li>My feet do feel more relieved after wearing them for 10-15 min.</li>
      <li>You cannot wear it during the day unless you plan to sit still for an hour or more.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve since moved on the the Comfy Toes Alignment Socks which are way better.</li>
      <li>but there are better options.</li>
      <li>Its cheap!</li>
      <li>I love these things.  </li>
      <li>Hopefully it helps I can see I am able to do a bit more curling without the gel toes</li>
      <li>LOVE these</li>
      <li>I like some of the others better</li>
      <li>but my podiatrist says this does nothing to help your toes or feet feel better.  </li>
      <li>After a days work on feet for most of the day this product did help alleviate some pain from my feet.</li>
      <li>you remove the tool from your feet, you do feel more relaxed and soothed.</li>
      <li>but I doubt they can provide a better experience.</li>
      <li>I just need to use them more often.</li>
      <li>One more clutter item.</li>
      <li>It was really comfortable to use and really easy to use as well!</li>
      <li>and I was able to put them on easily.  </li>
      <li>Comparing these cheap ones with twenty dollar ones, these come out on top.</li>
      <li>decided not to return them as they were so cheap anyways, and shipping might have been more than what I paid for them.  </li>
      <li>I am glad for all of you who find these comfortable.  </li>
      <li>Fortunately, those who&#x27;ve made the Ped-Egg have made something pretty good to help eliminate that stress with Pampered Toes.</li>
      <li>I heard good things about Yoga Toes, but won&#x27;t drop that much change for em.</li>
      <li>They are fairly easy to put on although the gel material does cause some friction.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I felt like a Hobbit wearing these. Sure, they push your toes apart, but there&#x27;s no lasting effect that I could discern. I think I got a bit taken in by the hype and now they are in the trash.</li>
    <li> These fit me fine (ladies shoe size 8.5 wide), and given the design, would probably fit most everyone.  But they are somewhat difficult to get on between my littlest toes.  However, after wearing them for an hour or so watching TV, when I remove them my toes are less bent under each other and I can definitely see improvement.</li>
    <li> About a year ago I bought this product based on positive reviews. I had heard about Yoga Toes but couldn&#x27;t afford them and this seemed to be a highly rated and affordable alternative. And, to my surprise, it was! I got them when I had an office job and my only sore feet were from wearing high heels to work, sitting in them all day, then walking back to the train to go home. They were a pleasant relaxation when I got home, liked the indulgence when I remembered to use them.  Then I got laid off and ended up taking a part time job in a green house. Good for the soul/sole, right? I was introduced to the world of standing on my feet for eight hours a day on concrete. Ouch. I&#x27;ve been trying various insole products to relieve the pain. Today I got home and remembered the &#x27;yoga toes.&#x27; Gave them a try....holy cow. After a couple of minutes my feet and toes were feeling cool and relaxed (note: I didn&#x27;t freeze or chill them). After 10 minutes I noticed a measurable difference when I got off the couch and walked to the bedroom. My feet didn&#x27;t hurt! I was so happy I remembered to use these. Wanted to share my delight and thought I would write my first review on Amazon. I hope this review helps. These really are a great product and I highly recommend them. I wear a size eight. I didn&#x27;t feel the need to use them on my little toe and it&#x27;s neighbor so left them out. Wasn&#x27;t an inconvenience since I was resting my feet and not walking.</li>
    <li> These were recommended by my yoga instructor. They keep feet flexible and at the end of along day provide relaxation for your feet</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these, one for me and one for my mother.  They are huge, way to thick all around, and impossible to put on.  You may get them on once but you won&#x27;t want to go through the work of getting them on again.  The material is way too thick and hard to stretch to get on each toe.  We both tried and we both think they are the uncomfortable and overall a very bad product.  Going in the garbage as the return postage and hassle is not worth the refund.</li>
    <li> This product even works for my Fred Flintstone toes! I feel like my toes are properly separated and that it&#x27;s even correcting my small bunion.  It is a bit uncomfortable at first, but that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s stretching your feet to a more natural position and working against the cramped toes you get from wearing conventional shoes. No pain, no gain! Just joking!  You&#x27;ll be so pleased with this product. Buy it! It&#x27;s effective and so much cheaper than [[ASIN:B002SPWET0 Original Small Pink YogaToes]] or some of the other brands that basically charge upwards of $30 for toe separators.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it is suppose to do and is comfortable.  I have had a challenge finding the pampered toes so was thrilled when Amazon had them.  We have used this product for 3 years.  All expectations were met.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter who has bunnions.  Her mom has the Yoga Toes.  This one works just as well and stays and does not slip off.</li>
    <li> COOL PRODUCT...FEELS COMFY</li>
    <li> The Telebrands Deluxe Pampered Toes were a big disapointment!  they were almost impossible to put on and then so uncomfortable that I could not leave them on for any time at all!</li>
    <li> Telebrands Deluxe Pampered Toes is another product that delivers what it says.Again comfortable and feels relaxing to the toes...Love it..</li>
    <li> They hurt even laying in the couch.</li>
    <li> I recently bought these for my girlfriend who has bunions on both of her feet. It has really helped her as far as pain and stress relief at the end of the day. Plus the price on them cannot be beat! I tried them on the other day, and there was some discomfort at first, but my toes felt much better when I took them off fifteen minutes later.</li>
    <li> the best pampered toes ever. Wear them for several minutes and you will feel relaxed and the stretch feels nice.</li>
    <li> These work great! Spreading your toes out streatches the muscles and joints helps reverse all the abuse you put your feet through during the day.</li>
    <li> I tried these toe seperators several times.  They became uncomfortable after a few minutes.  I finally had to quit using them.</li>
    <li> I just plain love these!  They&#x27;re comfy and really space my toes just right.  I have a slightly narrow size 9 foot and once I work my toes all the way in I sit back and R-E-L-A-X!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if these truly do anything but my feet, toes and I feel happy putting them on after a long day on my feet and cramped inside shoes.  These are far less expensive than the major brand version and my toes enjoy the stretch.</li>
    <li> These make my toes and feet feel so good, especially after wearing running shoes or cleats. They are cheaper than the other yoga toes and work just as well. Washing is easy too. The shipping was actually more expensive than the product itself!</li>
    <li> put them in the freezer and at the end of the day when you have tired feet and toes these are the best thing since sliced bread!</li>
    <li> this product feels great, but only for like 5 minutes, and then it gets painful.  The argument might be made that my feet just might not be used to it, but I think there is a lot of material between the toes and stretches them out too much, and there&#x27;s no way to adjust that.  The gel material also isn&#x27;t coated, so it attracts dust gets dirty really easily.  I was hoping for something that could separate my toes while I&#x27;m sleeping, and these just don&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I found a site reviewing them with \\&quot;trusted and knowledgeable sources.\\&quot;    I got so sad because the reviews were all negative.  I teach and practice yoga and I know a bit about what people do to themselves.  I got sad because the people reviewing them said the toe spreaders hurt, not comfy.  Well of course not!  Not at first.  The problem has been the decades of high heels and crampy shoes.  The soothing effect comes when you fix your feet and maybe choose better shoes that support a healthy foot, and you start to feel better.      It \\&quot;pains\\&quot; me that people think healing is all about a pill or a soothing treatment.  I digress, but the point is that the pain is not that much, and will abate with repeated use as you witness your feet get back to the way they are supposed to be.  Your shoes will fit differently, and your hips will open up more, and on from there-- the alignment of the body, being walking beings as we are, starts at the feet!</li>
    <li> Pros: They do what they say, and if it helps you that&#x27;s great, but it won&#x27;t help everyone.  Cons: Can&#x27;t walk easily in them.    Tricks: To get them on, use a SMALL amount of lotion placed on the tips of your toes.  This will help it slide on.  Put on too much lotion, and they&#x27;ll slide right off just as easily.  Next, start with the LITTLE two toes, then work your way to the big toe.  I find this works best for getting them on.</li>
    <li> Had some initial doubts upon receipt, but found substantial relief from pain in the pads of both feet upon regular use. The \\&quot;gel\\&quot; material is pretty hard and difficult to properly place for someone with a narrow foot. After using more than twenty minutes, toes get red and bones painful from pressure. Would definitely recommend for someone with wider feet.</li>
    <li> For the price and what it does, it can&#x27;t be beat. I like to use em during a hot bath after working/flying a long day. Give it a try!</li>
    <li> I wear 7 size for women. I tried this  because i am in higheels everyday and i get horrible cramps. Thie material is good and the idea is great but the separators between  the toes are too thick.  I cant&#x27;t use this at all. My toes strecht out in a very uncomfortable position  it does not look like the picture. I guess it works if you have giant feet. Dont waste your money</li>
    <li> Very uncomfortable, I can&#x27;t have it on for more than 5 minutes. I bought it because it was cheap, but I guess you get what you paid for; a cheap product with cheap quality</li>
    <li> I got this for my mom.  She has foot problems and can&#x27;t bend her toes very well.  The first time she used it she said she couldn&#x27;t get her toes into it because they wouldn&#x27;t move enough but after using it a few times, it&#x27;s really helping her mobility and flexibility.</li>
    <li> For those of us who like to wear high, pointy shoes...this is the way to stretch your toes out after a long day.  I put these on for 2 hrs a few times a week and I definitely see a difference in my bunions!</li>
    <li> Not sure how to review this. I am a dancer and I am always pampering my feet. This gadget caught my attention. It is super soft but after leaving it on for about five minutes my toes start to ache. I have a foot soak bath and have found that if I put this on my toes and soak them in almost  hot water for about 5 minutes then I take them off and massage my feet then it feels awesome.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like these.  Compared to the photo of the model&#x27;s toes in this product, the actual product is HUGE.  i had a hard time manually fitting my toes in between.  If I don&#x27;t use lotion (as it recommends as an option) it&#x27;s very painful just to put them on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a lot of discomfort the first few minutes, and some actual pain at the pinky toe. It goes away after a bit and when I take them off my toes are squished where the product presses against them, but otherwise slightly separated for a few moments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to like this product, as I try to take care of my feet and I consider my feet strong, and not very constricted by tight shoes anyway, but they are so big that I&#x27;m not sure how long I will continue to use this product.  My boyfriend, however, has no problem wearing them whatsoever.  But he has troll feet so I don&#x27;t really see that as a good thing!</li>
    <li> The foot soother is basically like Yoga Toes - soft, gel devices to stretch out the spaces between your toes in a &#x27;yoga&#x27;-like way. You put them over and between your toes. You relax with your feet up for a while. Then you remove the gel pads. Simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a trick to getting them on your feet and placing all your toes in position. The best way is to start with your big toe in place and then pull each other toe to the proper spot, one by one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you remove the tool from your feet, you do feel more relaxed and soothed. I try to use this every day after I sign off on the laptop and I do imagine there is some yogic long term benefit to the effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel pads arrives in one of those hard, non-recyclable plastic clam shells that are difficult to open. While cutting into the packaging you have to be very careful to not cut your hands on the sharp plastic. A more eco-friendly container that you can even use to store the pads in would be a nice upgrade to the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel picks up dust really easily, so it&#x27;s best to keep the little pads in a box, or rinse them off with cool water from time to time.</li>
    <li> Too big. One size does not fit all, probably at least a size 10 would benefit.</li>
    <li> and it does the job of separating toes so that feet do not end up mangled by women&#x27;s typical shoe styles.  The goal is to be able to walk comfortably into your old age, reduce the risk of painful bunions:  and so far this product is doing the trick</li>
    <li> The biggest benefit that I have received from \\&quot;Pampered Toes\\&quot; is that they have completely prevented any hint of Athletes Feet. No matter how I tried to prevent it with salves,powders and completely drying my feet after a shower I had one or two episodes of athletes feet every year. I wear them at least ten minutes every night and not only do they make me feel better but the skin (between my toes) feels better.</li>
    <li> I find these are great for my size 10 foot.  They are a bit tough to get on but they don&#x27;t come off untill you take them off.  I am beginning to get bunions and I noticed that my toes are not as flexible as they used to be.  After using these a few minutes each night I have noticed a big difference in that I have better alignment. They may be too thick for some people but I find that other toe spreaders just don&#x27;t \\&quot;spread enough\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time you use them they will probably be uncomfortable.  After a few minutes I forget I have them on.  I agree with the reviewer who said the more uncomfortable they are the more you need them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product. Did not break down quickly like a foam product would.</li>
    <li> Great for stretching your toes that are forever cramped in shoes of all sorts!</li>
    <li> I hesitated buying such a cheap YogaToes knockoff, especially when I read those negative one-star reviews. But I gambled on them, and let me tell you, I&#x27;m so glad I did! Comparing these cheap ones with twenty dollar ones, these come out on top. My feet are a size 8.5 in US Women&#x27;s, and they fit perfectly, providing just the right amount of stretch for my feet. I believe the gel would stretch to comfortably accommodate a size up or down, though. Overall, it was a great purchase, with an unbelievably low price!</li>
    <li> These did not work for my toes. I thought it to be too big. My toes did not fit into it as shown in the picture. I did try to put my last 2 toes together in one of the holes and that did not work either. I will be returning this item. My shoe size is 6 1/2 it may work for people that have bigger feet.</li>
    <li> The design is too clumsy and not contoured to the foot. It&#x27;s not recommended for smaller feet like mine. I wear a size 7 women&#x27;s shoe.</li>
    <li> fits perfectly on my toes. i can even walk around in them without slipping off! although, i struggle a little bit. maybe some sort of vibration or massage built it would be all the better.</li>
    <li> Telebrands Deluxe Pampered Toes are an interesting idea that can help your feet if they are sore. I recommend these if you want to try something new and I think that they are definitly worth a try.</li>
    <li> I purchased these because I am trying to avoid surgery on my toes and these were fairly cheap. Anyway, when they arrived, I tried them out. They are very difficult to try and jam your toes in as the silicone grabs and sticks to the toes. The good news is when you do get them on they are not going to slide off. The instructions say to only wear them for 15-20 min. Had I known that I probably would not have purchased them as I thought I could wear them all night. Oh, by they way, you might want to use the bathroom get water or a snack etc. before you put them on because you are not going to be able to walk once they are on and if you have to remove them for this then you start all over. I am not impressed!</li>
    <li> Love these! They are a little challenging to get on my smaller toes, only because my toes curl in nicely (not a good thing!). Once on, they feel awesome! You don&#x27;t need to buy the more expensive ones...I haven&#x27;t tried them...but I doubt they can provide a better experience.</li>
    <li> LOVE these and so does my 13 year old son. In fact i am going to buy him a pair of his own !!!!!</li>
    <li> When I first put them on I thought ughh those other reviews were right, I couldn&#x27;t get my little toe in! However, I discovered that if I put my little toe in first and then bend the toe holder around the natural curve of my foot, they fit better. If I move around a lot, my big toe pops out, but that is the toe I am least concerned about so it works well for the others. I have no other product to compare them to and so far they work like they are supposed to I think. Definitely a cheaper alternative than the yoga toes so I am happy! I did some more thinking...If your toes are fairly stubby, you might find this product more difficult to use.</li>
    <li> It was I expected a product that shows as advertise quality, ease of use and great material to stand time.</li>
    <li> I like this seller a lot. These yoga toes are really large though. Unless you are a Sasquatch I recommend the medium or smalls.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend as a stocking stuffer. She tried it out recently and while it did a good job of stretching her toes out some, it did nothing to alleviate any pain or stress. She seemed more interested in using this to paint her toe nails than after work, which was the intention. She did say that perhaps if her feet had been hurting, it may have helped some, but she did not see any benefit at the time. It also looked it took more effort than I thought it would to put on. Another review said there was a lot of friction when putting it on and she seemed to notice this too. She will use this product with her foot spa and to paint her toe nails, but to alleviate pain/stress, it doesn&#x27;t appear to work for her.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews about these. I was going back and fourth on if I should get the name brand or these. I chose these because of the price.. I just got surgery on my foot and the wrapped it up tight, where my toes were over lapping.. I really wanted these, but was worried that they would be to big for my feet.. more worried because my foot was sensitive. I was happy. I did not feel they were too big. They fit my foot just right and work well to straiten out and stretch my toes/feet out.   My foot is a slender 9 1/2  but the key is slender. again they fit awesome and I would buy again if something happened to these.  Thanks</li>
    <li> I bought these at a local pharmacy and struggled to get them on. The sections which fit inbetween each toe are very thick and the material is a bit tacky which makes it a struggle to get on. Once they are on, it&#x27;s not too bad. That said, I found that after using the, as directed for the better part of two weeks that they made no difference whatsoever. I suppose at this price it might be worth a try, but I will not use them again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like these because they are bulky and you cannot walk in them. They may work for you but I tried the socks, they barely do anything and now i&#x27;m using CorrectToes.</li>
    <li> Great product for tired toes!! They are a little tricky to put on, but once they are on they really do help.</li>
    <li> Select your seller carefully.  \\&quot;Quality You Can Trust\\&quot; sent out a cheaper and inferior substitute (Relaxus Thera Toes) instead of Telebrands Pampered Toes.  I had to go through the hassle of getting the correct item through Amazon customer service.  \\&quot;Quality You Can Trust\\&quot; does NOT live up to its name.</li>
    <li> Great invest.  I work in rehab and have noted that it has worked very well to relax/decrease tension in people&#x27;s feet, which in walking is your base of support.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a sort of \\&quot;sticky\\&quot;  gel material... the kind that I would have to be sure to keep clean, so I was very GLAD when the material was durable and not \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; at all! But the gel material is nice and cool on my sore feet! I was also expecting them to be smaller, as to not stretch the toes that much. BUT, I was pleased that they were bigger than I thought, and actually do provide a nice (but not painful or TOO MUCH of) a stretch. Overall I am VERYYYYY pleased with this product, and when they get old, I will most likely buy them again!! :D</li>
    <li> Only buy the AS SEEN ON TV brand!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had a product like this and was excited to try it out.  The first few times I wore them I kept them on for only about 10 mins or so to get my toes used to being stretched.  I use a bit of coconut oil to help slip them on, and they&#x27;re quite comfy and easy to clean.  The only downside, in my opinion, is that they can get a bit uncomfortable to place if you don&#x27;t use some sort of lotion/oil to slip them on.</li>
    <li> My complaint is not about the product&#x27;s quality, but in it&#x27;s usefulness for all foot types. I was expecting it to really stretch my toes and perhaps even uncurl my pinky toe. I had them on for hours while I watched TV the first day I got them, and when I took them off I felt absolutely nothing. I&#x27;m 6&#x27;1\\&quot; with relatively uncramped toes, so maybe I just need a bigger size.</li>
    <li> LOVEDDDDD the fast shipping and product! It was really comfortable to use and really easy to use as well! It fits many different size feet ( I used it on 3 different family members)! it made my feet feel refreshed and relaxed!</li>
    <li> One of the problems of modern life is the destruction of the foot. Wearing shoes and living in a concrete jungle play havoc on our feet. You only need 10-20 mins (don&#x27;t fall asleep with them on) 2-3 times a week and you will feel the difference and these are a fraction of the cost of the brand name. I have recommend these to maybe 50 people and never heard one complaint.</li>
    <li> I thought I purchased the Pampered Toes item as shown in the package. The item in the package is also known as &amp;#34;Ped Egg&amp;#34; which is written on the package and stamped on the item itself. I already own the Pampered Toes/Ped Egg, but this is definitely not what I received. The item that I received is not the same quality. It was shipped in a plastic bag, not in the package that is shown on Amazon. Disappointed that I did not receive the item that is shown. This is the first time that this has happened with Amazon.</li>
    <li> I wore them. Just okay; didn&#x27;t seem to really help much.  Tried them a couple times. Maybe if someone wears them every night it would work (??).</li>
    <li> Good value product.&lt;br /&gt;Received reasonably quickly and works as expected.&lt;br /&gt;Hard to ask for much more for, and no need to spend $30 or more for basic use, follow some others recommendations for getting to fit easily.</li>
    <li> These have too thin of plastic and broke after two days of use.  decided not to return them as they were so cheap anyways, and shipping might have been more than what I paid for them.  You get what you pay for, I guess.</li>
    <li> Too fat.  Can&#x27;t even get toes in the holes without first greasing them up with other stuff.  Then it is a waste of time afterward.</li>
    <li> Bought these do to some foot pain and they definitely seem to help.  Worth the low cost and seem to be holding up fine.</li>
    <li> Love what these do for my toes, but I have only used it 5 times and one toe separator has already fallen off! Shame... I really like this. If it was more durable 5/5</li>
    <li> these really help. I was sure this was a gimmick or a fad but honestly whenever I get &amp;#34;turf toe&amp;#34; / the beginning of a bunion starting to act up, I slip these on and relax in bed for a half hour or more and it takes it away! love this!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over a year, so I purchased several more as gifts.  My feedback has been good.  They all like the product very much.</li>
    <li> Maybe I have flexible feet already but I&#x27;m not totally sure what these are doing for me. My feet don&#x27;t hurt even if I wear them for a long time so I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re working. I was hoping they&#x27;d help with plantar fasciitis but I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference.</li>
    <li> There is no question about the needs to handle stress everyday. But when it does come right down to our feet, we really don&#x27;t do a good enough job of trying to take care of them, and just let them relax. Fortunately, those who&#x27;ve made the Ped-Egg have made something pretty good to help eliminate that stress with Pampered Toes. This is very strong by stretch your toes out, and making them relax and soothed from stress that can effect the way that you walk, the way you feel after you sit down from your feet. It really is worth the money. They&#x27;re easy to wash, and simple to use each and every time. I absolutely recommend this as one of those few \\&quot;As Seen On TV\\&quot; products that really is worth its money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price: B&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Convience: B+&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: B 1/2+</li>
    <li> I bought these because I didn&#x27;t want to shell out 40 bucks for Yoga Toes. These are extremely tight around my big toe. I have average feet, 7.5 US, and my big toe is not larger than normal. I ended up just biting the bullet and purchased Yoga Toes. Save your money.</li>
    <li> I am glad for all of you who find these comfortable.  I did not and returning them would cost more than keeping them.      The toe spacers are way too big.  After struggling for about 5 minutes, I finally got the spacers, except for the one for the little toe, on.  Kept it on while struggling with second one which I never got past the big toe.  Very uncomfortable experience.    These are going in the trash.  I thought of using them as dog toys, but figured my dog was smarter than me (she really is!) about what to play with.</li>
    <li> This product might be a good idea, it just isn&#x27;t very practical or comfortable. It cannot be worn at night while you sleep because it slips or gets pulled off by the sheets. You cannot wear it during the day unless you plan to sit still for an hour or more. Moral of the story, this product needs to go back to the drawing board but its like they say - you pay for what you get. Its cheap!</li>
    <li> I love these things.  They are very comfortable and I was able to put them on easily.  I even walked around quite a bit and they stayed on.  My feet were fine but I had a bad headache when I put these on.  In minutes my headache disappeared.  I&#x27;m not sure what this did but I get migraines and once they start they&#x27;re hard to stop.  I wore them for about 20 minutes and when I took them off my toes stayed stretched apart for a while.  These seem good quality and amazing for the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a foot rub fanatic. So when I cannot get a foot rub and need some quick relief I just pop these babies on for about 20 minutes. However, I have a size 7 woman&#x27;s foot...and a narrow, thin foot at that. I do have to shove my toes into these and after a little white it does start to feel like the circulation in my toes is getting cut off...aka...bright red toes. You definitely have to sit there and shimmy and shove each toe into this. The rubber is soft and gel-like. This works for me..I like it..but for a man? No way...and for a woman with big, chunkier feet....I would say no too.</li>
    <li> The product works as promised. My toes don&#x27;t cramp like they used to - just be careful and not wear them for an extended amount of time. The recommended time is all you need.</li>
    <li> I like these I just need to use them more often. You can tell it helps keep your toes separated and could help with hammer toes if used often.</li>
    <li> These are for night time use only. The are very difficult to impossible to get on your feet, and I doubt that they will help!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t work, enough said.</li>
    <li> People make fun of when I wear these in front of them, but I can feel an immediate difference in my foot muscles.  Going from boots to heels to flats is stressful on my feet. I slip these on when I&#x27;m giving my self a pedicure and my feet get to stretch.</li>
    <li> I regret buying these.  I am just as happy using my foam toe spacers from Target... the kind you use to space your toes for a pedicure.  At least these were a lot cheaper than Yoga Toes!  One more clutter item.</li>
    <li> Excellent, very good product.</li>
    <li> If you like having your feet worked over - these are great.  I am a guy and I just like how it relaxes your feet (I use these when I can&#x27;t go get a foot massage)…I can only imagine how great these must feel for women who wear heels that push their toes all together….this is nirvana</li>
    <li> i already own a set of these &amp; so i ordered a pair for my mom.  BIG FLY SPORTS did not send what was in the picture.  they sent a knock off brand and not in any type of original packaging. they could be used for all i know.  the pedi-egg company product is great but, be sure to order them from another amazon company.</li>
    <li> Did not come in the original package, so they seemed used and was pink. I threw them in the trash.</li>
    <li> I never got my purchase, not because it wasn&#x27;t delivered but because I never updated my new address to Amazon!! What a huge stupid mistake!! And I made a negative review without checking my profile only to feel like an idiot at my own mistake. It sounds ridicously plain but make sure that your information is up to date, don&#x27;t simply click all willy nilly like I did.</li>
    <li> After a days work on feet for most of the day this product did help alleviate some pain from my feet. It separates the toes and stretches them  apart giving you a little better circulation after having your feet crunched up in shoes. Okay product and nicely made.</li>
    <li> it does it&#x27;s job i guess but it&#x27;s quite large and bulky so one of my end toes either has to be left out or over stretched</li>
    <li> I ordered these for my husband one size fits all, no they don&#x27;t, he couldn&#x27;t get his small toe in the hole for the little toe, I have small feet and toes, they where very tight on my toes.</li>
    <li> I have several of these by different companies and this one is good. I like some of the others better but this one still does the job of helping to strengthen my feet. If you are looking to get into barefoot running or to get rid of foot cramps from standing all day. This product will help you to strengthen your feet and a strong base can beat nothing else to provide relief.</li>
    <li> Took awhile to receive as they were shipped from China. Do the job</li>
    <li> These things definitely stretch my toes apart but maybe a little too much because after awhile my feet start to hurt. They are fairly easy to put on although the gel material does cause some friction. I actually tore my first pair trying to put them on. They are good for the price but there are better options. I&#x27;ve since moved on the the Comfy Toes Alignment Socks which are way better.</li>
    <li> I have short toes and these work just fine. My feet do feel more relieved after wearing them for 10-15 min. I did fall asleep with them on and woke up from a little cramp in my toes but nothing serious to worry about.</li>
    <li> I wear high heels everyday and have for years . I also suffer leg and back pain from dancing and always being on my feet. I also practice yoga. These have literally changed my feet! I have more balance in my yoga practice. Also, when I get home from work I lay down with them on for about ten minutes and my feet and legs feel so much better! My toes no longer look scrunched together. My feet not only feel healthier, they look healthier too. I&#x27;m so glad someone invented this. Why didn&#x27;t I think of these!</li>
    <li> i gave it an average rating because if you have small toes and feet your pinky toe will not fit into it.</li>
    <li> I bought these instead of the more expensive yoga toes. They are bigger than my toes, but that doesn&#x27;t matter, they still work.</li>
    <li> They work perfectly. My feet are not so tired at the end of the evening. Also has been helping keep my toes separated.</li>
    <li> Not a big fan. They were SO wide it hurt my toes so they were sent back.</li>
    <li> Too small. Otherwise good.</li>
    <li> great idea, 5 minutes a day to stretch my toes! although shoe designers could just stop making football shaped shoes...</li>
    <li> it was very good I love it very very much and ships very past too love this web page !</li>
    <li> Good product for a very low price. Really helps to stretch toes and relax your feet. I wanted to buy the official yogi toes but didn&#x27;t want to spend that much. These work great.</li>
    <li> I am suffering from a bunion on my right toe. I really wanted YogaToes or SmartToes to stretch my toes out and help correct the bunion. However, I did not want to pay $35+ for them. I decided to go the cheap route and buy these. However, they did not work for me at all and ended up being a total waste of money. It stretches all other toes except my big toe, which is the one I needed relief for. It&#x27;s so big that it won&#x27;t even stay on my big toe and I can&#x27;t use it. Too tight on my smaller toes; all in all it&#x27;s a bad design. It does nothing to stretch my big toe, which is what I&#x27;ve heard about all the knock-off brands. The best option is to just go ahead and pay more for the real deal as this and other imitators simply do not do the trick! I did give it 2 stars because of the fast shipping and the fact that it may work for people with larger feet (I am a women&#x27;s shoe size 8.5), but it was not the right product for me.</li>
    <li> I really love these. the only thing I would say is don&#x27;t put any thing heavy on them or else they will get dents in them but they are awesome if you have tried feet a lot!!!!</li>
    <li> silliest thing I ever bought.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re ok, but nothing special.</li>
    <li> VERY hard/uncomfortable....</li>
    <li> If your toes are close together, these will spread your toes into an uncomfortable position.  Too much padding between the toes for me. I wear a. Shoe size 71/2 and have toes that are normally aligned.</li>
    <li> Sent this to my sister .  She gets a lot of foot pain just like me.  I love this invention.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Size fit. Bette pricing than I could get locally. Product works used as directed. Love putting these on after a hardwork out or being on my feet all day.</li>
    <li> I like them ,at first I could only use for only two to three minutes because it hurt my pinky toes, I have been using for a couple weeks and now I leave them on for about  30 minutes each night,I think it helps my feet to expand my toes. I think it has expanded the ball of my foot where my contact point with the ground is.I think because my second toe is allot longer than my big toe ,it caused too much pressure on one localized point directly under the secound toe.</li>
    <li> Although you best be ready to sit around once these are cuddling your toes, they are wonderful. Now everyone in my house wants to use them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering for awhile now, I have a second toe that want&#x27;s to be to close for comfort with my big toe. I&#x27;m on my feet for 8-11 hours a day, so the pain would become more than an annoyance. I reasearched different toe spacers made from different materials that were considerably more pricey than these. I was unsure if anything like this would even be effective, so I didn&#x27;t want to invest in the more costly product. I have been extatic about the effectiveness of this product. My pain has almost deminished to the point that I have forgotten about it, I started wearing them for about 15min @ a time a couple of times a week, &amp; have graduated to about an hour now once a week. I can tell when I&#x27;ve become to busy &amp; forget about the pain, when I feel a twinge...the pampered toes are not forgotten that day. I tell people about them alot. I think it&#x27;s crazy that something that spreads your toes apart takes the pain away! Thank goodness for Pampered Toes! Tiffany M</li>
    <li> This product works great as long as I&#x27;m not getting cramps in my feet from nerve damage. I purchased another similirar type that even though it was large (I wear a size 9 1/2 wide shoe) I could never get all five toes in the other pair. I purchased these and they fit. Thanks amazon.com</li>
    <li> Kind of felt it was helping but my podiatrist says this does nothing to help your toes or feet feel better.  Just letting you know.</li>
    <li> It hurts my toes. Spreads them out too far.</li>
    <li> They are comfy gel-like material. But if you have moderate to severe bunions these won&#x27;t do much to stretch your big toe. I&#x27;m a runner &amp; bought these to help with my bunion on my left foot. Maybe they&#x27;ll surprise me &amp; work but I&#x27;m not holding my breath on them. They&#x27;re cheap----spend a little bit more &amp; buy a good pair.</li>
    <li> These are best in their price range and feel nice on my feet. I heard good things about Yoga Toes, but won&#x27;t drop that much change for em. These are a great runner up. The big toe is a little big &amp; isn&#x27;t a perfect fit, but I don&#x27;t see how they could make it so, since this is a one size product. I would definitely recommend this one!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed because though the item said it fit most men and women it did not fit me who wears a size womans wide 11 and1/2. my toes curl over abit but i could not even get them on.They were cumbersome and ill shaped. i purchased this at Amazon.</li>
    <li> I broke my foot a few years ago and it has not been the same since and my massage therapist suggested using these daily. I first apply arnica gel to the area where I broke it and massage for about 5 minutes and do the other foot as well. Then I put these on while sitting on my bed and push my toes down in a curling fashion. This is strengthening my foot and breaking up the scare tissue. I also have hamstring pain that my massage therapist is related to me not being able to curl my foot or press down like on the break in the car. Hopefully it helps I can see I am able to do a bit more curling without the gel toes so I do see some improvement after two weeks-</li>
    <li> I use these with an icy hot, or other rub, they are then easy to put on and off. I can tell my feet are being realigned.&lt;br /&gt;Even pre- bunions feel better!</li>
