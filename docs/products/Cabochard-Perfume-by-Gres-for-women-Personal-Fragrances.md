    <li> This cologne is not too heavy and has a beautiful fragrance.  I try not to dose myself up too much-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;just spray it into the air in front of me-walk into it-and I smell delicious all day.  Or so I&#x27;m told.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mom who wore this fragrance over forty years ago.  She said it took her down memory lane, making her feel young again!  It is a very pleasant fragrance.</li>
    <li> I remembered the fragrance differently so I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> Thank you!!!!! Happy customer!!!</li>
    <li> My friend really love this scent is a kind fresh and musky, leather... extravagant perfume. For many year she couldn&#x27;t buy at store and i&#x27;ve made her surprise. She has apreciated so much!!!&lt;br /&gt;I think will buy again!</li>
    <li> I always give this fragrance to my sister for Christmas. I was delighted to find it through Amazon this year at such a reasonable price. The vendor shipped it almost immediately and it arrived within a few days. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Arrived in perfect condition as shown in photo.</li>
    <li> Excelente product, excelent price !!!</li>
    <li> Very nice perfume, been around for a long time. Very nice price.</li>
    <li> Gave this perfume for a Christmas gift. My mother in law loved it she had a very wonderful essence to her after that. Wears it all the time makes the air smell good.</li>
    <li> I really love my other fragrances by Gres. I love Cabotine and Cabaret. I took a chance on this one and I don&#x27;t care for it. It&#x27;s too spicy and it makes my nose itch. LOL! About 8 hours into the wearing, it is almost pleasant.</li>
    <li> Great scent. My professional wife is wearing it for many years. It is now part of her personality.</li>
    <li> I always get compliments when I wear this parfum.</li>
    <li> not a great longevity though, but cheap price for quality perfume is great</li>
    <li> My Sara loved it and it was half the price she has paid in the past!! We will always buy it here in the future!</li>
    <li> I have used Cabochard for for 30 years and then it disappeared. I am very, very happy that Amazon was able to get it for me. Thank you - IRK</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Cabochard for maybe 35 years now.  For the past several years, it has been more difficult to find and I&#x27;ve been buying the Eau de Toilette rather than the Parfum.  Even though the bottle shape has changed in the past years, the scent of the \\&quot;eau de toilette\\&quot; has always been what I am used to.  I was delighted to find the Cabochard Eau de Parfum here online, thinking it would just be a more concentrated version of the toilette water.  Strangely enough, it is stronger but not in as good a way as I would have liked.  My nose is not very refined but I think it&#x27;s maybe the tobacco element of the perfume that is not reacting well with my skin and I&#x27;m not liking this as well as the cologne.  After this bottle of perfume is gone, I&#x27;m going back to buying the Cabochard Eau de Toilette.</li>
    <li> The perfume was old and stale.  Unusuable.  As I had already thrown away the packaging I had to throw it away.  Waste of money.</li>
