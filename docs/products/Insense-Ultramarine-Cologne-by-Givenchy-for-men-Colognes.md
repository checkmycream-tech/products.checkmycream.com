      <li>liked it, but there is better.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>So glad I&#x27;ve found it at a good price.</li>
      <li>This is a nice fragrance and over time the price has increased.  </li>
      <li>I will continue to keep purchaing this cologne, because it smells so deliciously good, and I received so many compliments that I stopped counting.</li>
      <li>Pleasant cool fragrance.</li>
      <li>I really love it and it is good that you can find it in Amazon because they don&#x27;t sell it any mora at the duty free.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite perfume ever.</li>
      <li>I love it for spring and summer, fall and winter</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be buying more soon.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I am glad that I can still purchase this item</li>
      <li>Received this today and love it already, I love the fact ANY fragrance by this maker stays on all day and then some.</li>
      <li>It is more distinctive and just has a cleaner cooler smell.  </li>
      <li>I have used this cologne for many years and now that the manufacturer stopped making it</li>
      <li>Refreshing and floral</li>
      <li>If your like me and wish to make a statement, any of their fragrances you will love</li>
      <li>As with most Givenchy colognes, this one doesn&#x27;t disappoint.  </li>
      <li>recommend it for the people who love strong perfume.</li>
      <li>while staying masculine, it&#x27;s great for the summer.  </li>
      <li>Also seems to keep its strong projection for an eternity.  </li>
      <li>Some complain that the fragrance is overpowering, but I find it to be very light and ultra fresh.  </li>
      <li>It shares the bottle with Insense and Greenergy, which are both fantastic fragrances and hold notes over the want-to-be&#x27;s and wish-I-were, also.  </li>
      <li>and I ran out of my last drops, I was happy to find out that I could still purchase this one.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t like strong, distinct fragrances then buy something more mild.</li>
      <li>This is a truly unique scent that goes on lightly and lasts the day.</li>
      <li>My new favorite!</li>
      <li>Good item and fast shipping, thanks...</li>
      <li>Nautica has Voyage, Joop has Nightflight and Davidoff has Silver Shadow Altitude and Cool Water Frozen, but Givenchy just knocked it out of the ballpark.  </li>
      <li>It is an amazing combination between spicy and sweet, which you can wear to a business meeting and social occation.</li>
      <li>the die down is great.  </li>
      <li>After about 15-20 minutes the true smell comes out and it is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>This cologne has a fresh and sweet smell reminiscent of the ocean air and is potent.</li>
      <li>My personal favorite .</li>
      <li>I simply love the smell of this blue perfume.</li>
      <li>Been in love with Insense for a long time.</li>
      <li>expected more from givenchy.does not last .smell is just ok</li>
      <li>I highly advise xeryus rouge by givenchy.</li>
      <li>I was hoping it would at least resemble the legendary first variety of Insense that was a pale yellow in color</li>
      <li>duration is far from the quality of a Kouros Body</li>
      <li>and it arrived as expected, for the very reasonable price.</li>

<li> /&gt;It lasts for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> but unfortunately this version just smells sickly sweet.</li>
<li> Contrast with Givenchy Pour Homme which lasts about half as long.</li>
<li> I have received a few compliments also, so that is always a plus.</li>
<li> Long-lasting without requiring excessive or repeat application (lasts 8-10 hours on me as a deodorant-alternative combined with lotion and crystal anti-perspirant).  </li>
<li> My usual daytime cologne was Xerius Rogue.</li>
<li> bought it for old time&#x27;s sake and wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The Ads say it&#x27;s 3.4 FL. OZ, but when I received it was 3.3 FL. OZ  as written on it</li>
    <li> bought it for old time&#x27;s sake and wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
    <li> The best, cleanest, most sophisticated warm-weather scent for men there is. Class.</li>
    <li> Once you get past the initial synthetic smell (which is pretty pungent) the die down is great.  After about 15-20 minutes the true smell comes out and it is exactly what I was looking for.  Refreshing and floral while staying masculine, it&#x27;s great for the summer.  Also seems to keep its strong projection for an eternity.  My new favorite!</li>
    <li> Thank you&lt;br /&gt;as I expect.</li>
    <li> I was hoping it would at least resemble the legendary first variety of Insense that was a pale yellow in color but unfortunately this version just smells sickly sweet.</li>
    <li> This is a truly unique scent that goes on lightly and lasts the day. A quiet surprise that you will not forget.</li>
    <li> This is the lotion I&#x27;ve been using for the last 20 years. I really love it and it is good that you can find it in Amazon because they don&#x27;t sell it any mora at the duty free.</li>
    <li> I love it. I simply love the smell of this blue perfume. There is another perfume from Givenchy named Blue and It&#x27;s good too but This one is something that makes ladies remember the man who wears it!</li>
    <li> Very very good smell!!!</li>
    <li> expected more from givenchy.does not last .smell is just ok</li>
    <li> My husband loves this scent.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume ever. Nothing else to say.</li>
    <li> Been in love with Insense for a long time. So glad I&#x27;ve found it at a good price. I&#x27;ll be buying more soon.</li>
    <li> This is a nice fragrance and over time the price has increased.  I often purchase several fragrances and put them in the bathrooms so that guests can freshen up.  This is one of the freshest fragrances and Givenchy does the best job.  Nautica has Voyage, Joop has Nightflight and Davidoff has Silver Shadow Altitude and Cool Water Frozen, but Givenchy just knocked it out of the ballpark.  It is more distinctive and just has a cleaner cooler smell.  Some complain that the fragrance is overpowering, but I find it to be very light and ultra fresh.  It shares the bottle with Insense and Greenergy, which are both fantastic fragrances and hold notes over the want-to-be&#x27;s and wish-I-were, also.  I would recommend all of these Givenchy fragrances.</li>
    <li> I like it.&lt;br /&gt;Delicious, exquisite for daytime wear.&lt;br /&gt;Its duration is far from the quality of a Kouros Body</li>
    <li> Its smell is so strong.&lt;br /&gt;It lasts for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I liked it, but there is better.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it for the people who love strong perfume.</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne based upon the brand and description and boy did I &amp;#34;hit a home run&amp;#34;. This cologne smells deliciously good. I kept spraying it on and then smelling it. This cologne has a fresh and sweet smell reminiscent of the ocean air and is potent. I will continue to keep purchaing this cologne, because it smells so deliciously good, and I received so many compliments that I stopped counting. I hope that Givench never stops making this cologne.</li>
    <li> Received this today and love it already, I love the fact ANY fragrance by this maker stays on all day and then some. I love it for spring and summer, fall and winter I highly advise xeryus rouge by givenchy. If you don&#x27;t like strong, distinct fragrances then buy something more mild. If your like me and wish to make a statement, any of their fragrances you will love</li>
    <li> I decided to try something different. My usual daytime cologne was Xerius Rogue. I thought I would give this a shot, and am very glad I did. The scent does last quite awhile, not over powering. I have received a few compliments also, so that is always a plus.</li>
    <li> I have used this cologne for many years and now that the manufacturer stopped making it and I ran out of my last drops, I was happy to find out that I could still purchase this one. It is an amazing combination between spicy and sweet, which you can wear to a business meeting and social occation. I am glad that I can still purchase this item and it arrived as expected, for the very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> todo bien gracias, rápido, excelente, vendedor buena la oferta espero volver a  comprales otra ves  sin mas nada que desir.</li>
    <li> As with most Givenchy colognes, this one doesn&#x27;t disappoint.  Long-lasting without requiring excessive or repeat application (lasts 8-10 hours on me as a deodorant-alternative combined with lotion and crystal anti-perspirant).  Pleasant cool fragrance.

    <li> Great perfume. My personal favorite .</li>
    <li> Love this product. Have been using it since 1996 or so.</li>
    <li> ... yummmmm ... great scent ... use sparingly.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for</li>
    <li> Good item and fast shipping, thanks...</li>
