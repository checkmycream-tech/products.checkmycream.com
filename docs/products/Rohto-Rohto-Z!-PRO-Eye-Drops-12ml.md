      <li>Hurts so good.</li>
      <li>I think they&#x27;re great, but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re THAT much better than the Rohto Arctic you can buy in the store.  </li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;sting&amp;#34; that I feel, is very refreshing.</li>
      <li>but they seem great, and I&#x27;ve also enjoyed the Arctic and the Ice versions.</li>

      <li>Honestly I just ordered this March 2,2015</li>
      <li>either way the excess of tears hydrates the eye nicely.</li>
      <li>Everybody says it stings, honestly it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t care what people say, if you have this problem it&#x27;s an amazingly effective solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>/&gt;Believe me, I&#x27;ve tried scores of U.S. made eye products and none did the job as well as this one, Rohto Rohto is well worth the money!!!  </li>
      <li>drops are simply the best product after a day at the office looking at screens etc., and for preparing for a good night out.</li>
      <li>Case is also very easy to use.</li>
      <li>So, go find them and have a much more satisfying conversation and day!)</li>
      <li>Love these They work amazingly</li>
      <li>These are very strong, I am wondering if the amount of menthol in these drops is safe for the eyes.  </li>
      <li>That being said, I think most everything can be improved.</li>
      <li>you let a droplet fall into each of your eyes (however many you have), it feels like you&#x27;re enjoying/</li>
      <li>But that is my favorite part about them.</li>
      <li>love these drops.</li>
      <li>I look at screens more than 6 hours per day at work.</li>
      <li>Doesnt burn as much as many say.</li>

      <li>This company has been around for many years and this product &#x27;zings&#x27; your eyes into shape with the ingredients like Menthol in them.</li>

      <li>I must say these are 100 times better.</li>

      <li>Its simply the best feeling you could imagine.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m feeling better than ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>We love this product</li>
      <li>I ran out about two weeks ago and had to resort to Visine instead while waiting for more to arrive, and there&#x27;s just no comparison.</li>
      <li>I want to try more types of these Rohto or Japanese eye drops, these are wonderful.</li>
      <li>Love the packaging and the square container.</li>
      <li>, they have more of a burn feeling then</li>
      <li>Burns like he&#x27;ll but nothing works better for me.  </li>
      <li>Burns like hell but love how my eyes feel after wards.</li>
      <li>love it</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Fantastic, would buy again!</li>
    <li> so refreshing! For the 1st time user, be sure to use only a tiny drop the 1st time, otherwise the freezing sensation may be too strong. But it will feel much better in the next a few uses.</li>
    <li> felt like acid on my eyes</li>
    <li> Works well at refreshing your eyes but does sting at first for about 5 minutes, then your eyes feel very soothed</li>
    <li> Refreshing, does not take the red out! If anything, it made my eyes look more glassy and red.</li>
    <li> I wanted the Bausch &amp; Lombe redness relief, but this is all I found. Do yourself a favor and steer clear!! It&#x27;s like putting wintergreen or peppermint in your eyes! The initial STING is very unpleasant. They work alright...once you recover, but if you&#x27;re driving, forget it! 3-5 min recovery until you can see.</li>
    <li> Zip it rip it menthol do your thing!</li>
    <li> Hurts so good. I am the night nurse. The one you want in a pinch in the middle of the night. And I have bloodshot eyes. Bloodshot like I&#x27;ve been on a drunk for weeks. Too old for that now, but I digress. Alone in my room, I took my pulse and dosed my eyes. I went blind and then I saw the light. The Japanese did good here.</li>
    <li> If you want your eyes to feel fresh and alive you will want to use this product.  I will clear all the crap out of your eyes.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t get enough of these. Clears my eyes right up.</li>
    <li> really shocked by how much it burns my eyes. Used it three times. Packaging is nice but product is painful. Wonder what it is doing to my eye?!!!! Bi mistake for me at least!!</li>
    <li> I ordered the Z! Pro Eye Drops and used them for the first time yesterday.  I was a little apprehensive since they came from out of the country ... Japan.  The first feeling was a rather burning minty feeling.  After a minute or two it went away and then my eyes were very white.  Wow, I was surprised.  Not only that but my eyes felt very clean and clear.&lt;br /&gt;I love these drops.</li>
    <li> more then met my expectations!</li>
    <li> Everybody says it stings, honestly it doesn&#x27;t. The &amp;#34;sting&amp;#34; that I feel, is very refreshing. I&#x27;m a game, so I used it after a long session. It completely healed and refreshed my eyes, it&#x27;s like I slept for 12 hours and I&#x27;m feeling better than ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, if you think this &amp;#34;stings&amp;#34; I&#x27;m pretty sure your just a sissy, no offense bros, but this eye drop is like heavenly water</li>
    <li> An amazing eye drop!  Refreshes and clears your eyes!  I&#x27;ve been using this eye drops for nearly 8 years!  and haven&#x27;t found any other eye drop as effective.</li>
    <li> Better than clear eyes or visine.  First 30 seconds are a bit hectic but overall good product.</li>
    <li> I think they&#x27;re great, but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re THAT much better than the Rohto Arctic you can buy in the store.  Feel pretty comparable to me.  The case is cool though.</li>
    <li> Maybe that&#x27;s a bad thing, but I notice a slight whitening to my eyes. I still have a long way to go but I love the cooling effects of this product.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for me. I feel the drops burning/cooling my eyes but see no difference in color.</li>
    <li> Really good at the first time using, but after that, feel completely normal. Good product in overall</li>
    <li> Ok so I have been using Rohto &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;ice&amp;#34; prior to receiving these. I must say these are 100 times better. Its the most intense feeling. Yes it hurts at first. Its literally like dropping acid in your eye. My coworker compared it to being tasered in the eye. After the burning goes away its like having a mint in your eye. Its simply the best feeling you could imagine. Order these immediately. You wont regret it.</li>
    <li> It is really effective.We love this product a lot!We are willing to order more.My eyes feels awesome using this product.</li>
    <li> I really like these eyedrops. As mentioned in Wired Magazine, &amp;#34; Mouthwash for your eyes&amp;#34;. They sting a little at first, but reward you with refreshing and clear vision</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s face it.. you&#x27;ve been driving all night on a road trip or been staring at porn on your computer all night and your eyes are starting to hurt. Sure you could reach for some Visine or Clear Eyes... but you&#x27;ll be putting more drops in 15 minutes later, because they just don&#x27;t get the job done. It&#x27;s like using the windshield wipers on your dirty car... it&#x27;s not as effective as the homeless guy who stands at the intersection in the bad part of town with his squeegie and spray bottle of Windex. He&#x27;s gonna get your windows factory clean, and thats why you&#x27;ll give him a few bucks.    Enter Rohto Z! Pro (formerly known as Rohto Zi Free) These are the strongest eye drops on the market. Their burning level is ranked at a 7... Santo Neo F/X drops are only a mere 5! These are the uncut heroin of eye drops... sure, they cost a little more, but your eyes will know where that extra money went. First your eyes burn like you poured gasoline in them... you&#x27;ll think maybe some jackass at the factory in Japan is playing a trick on &#x27;round eye&#x27;... but then 30-60 seconds later the pain subsides, and you open your eyes... to a whole new experience. They feel fresh and &#x27;minty&#x27;. It&#x27;s as if God was at that intersection and he got out his Diety-Windex and squeegie and cleaned your eyes for you. It&#x27;s like being given a whole new set of eyes!    Unlike standard eyedrops, Rohto eyedrops refresh and &#x27;wake-up&#x27; your eyes in addition to clearing them for you. It&#x27;s an awesome pick-me-up for tired eyes. They have a cool minty after effect that can only be experienced to fully understand.    Rohto has been in business since 1899 and has been making eye drops since 1909..... that&#x27;s over a century of Japanese know-how!    Mind you these are so strong that they aren&#x27;t available on the US market. Only Rohto V is available here and they&#x27;re nowhere near as strong. Pay the extra money. You&#x27;ll only need to use them once in awhile... unlike the Visine bottle that will be half empty by the end of the day.A word of caution do NOT use these while wearing contacts.... they&#x27;ll ruin them... forever. Take them out first, and wait at least 15 minutes to put them back in. Also, pull over to the side of the road if you&#x27;re going to put them in while on a road trip (I speak from experience on this one) Driving with both eyes closed for 60 seconds is not ideal.    You should probably only use 1-2 drops at a time, and then only a few times a day at maximum... as if you would need them more often then that.    I started using these back when me and my friend would stay up all night with some strippers doing rails of coke off the our friends stainless steel medical examination table in his loft apartment when our eyes would be tired after being up all night.. they would refresh us so we could keep on goin&#x27; as the sun came up. These are cocaine for your eyes. We started doing more eye drops than we did bumps of coke.    Imagine having to see the road at night while you drive, but you&#x27;re tired, and your eyes are getting heavy. Do you want to fall asleep and run off the road and get into a car crash so severe that you get thrown out the front window and wrap around a road sign? How will you explain to your children that they don&#x27;t have a daddy anymore because he was too cheap to buy 24$ eye drops so he got the cheap American ones instead, fell asleep and crashed his Buick?    For the sake of your children... and the chrome job of your &#x27;78 Buick.... get these eyedrops. They&#x27;re made in Japan and the Japanese know how to make things that work!</li>
    <li> Omg, totally like everyone says, minty freshness for your eyes. I&#x27;m a woman and although it does sting a bit it&#x27;s really not that bad lol. Seriously lol. I had my brother and mom try it and they said the same thing. it doesn&#x27;t whiten as well as others though and that&#x27;s why I got it :-/</li>
    <li> I was expecting something stronger than Arctic. It&#x27;s only slightly stronger.</li>
    <li> This is amazing. I was using Rohto Ice for a couple days prior to receiving my Z! Pro. I really loved the Ice, but after receiving and using the Z! Pro a couple times, holy crap what a difference it makes. Unlike other reviewers or the pictures depict, my packaging came with the indication that this was not just a 7 on the intensity scale, but actually &amp;#34;8+&amp;#34; which I believe. For me it did not feel any colder or mintier, but rather that addicting &amp;#34;freeze&amp;#34; lasted much longer. Along with that, my eyes simply have never felt/looked better. I got a Playstation 4 recently, and apparently TV gaming makes my large sensitive eyes very irritated either due to less blinking or focal strain. Rohto Ice was doing the job better than any other prior eye drops I had tried, but Rohto Z! Pro is just freaking amazing. Perhaps ease yourself into it with something like Ice or Hydra, or if you&#x27;re feeling trustworthy in your fellow reviewers, just go for it and get the Z! Pro. It is absolutely indescribable.</li>
    <li> This product had me skeptical, but I am now a true believer. I constantly had red eye issues, but not anymore. It&#x27;s uncomfortable at first to take, bit I got used to it. It&#x27;s like someone put a cold, cool breeze of mint in your eyes. I will continue to order this product. Best eye whitener in the market that I ever tried.</li>
    <li> i love these eye drops and all of rohto&#x27;s other products, i typically use Arctic or Cool, these chill your eyes for a bit shorter time, but are otherwise equally as enjoyable to use and equally as effective as their cheaper counterparts. i bought these based on the hilarious reviews of them, i regret nothing... but i can&#x27;t say i&#x27;d buy again, arctic and cool do everything i need for 1/3 the price.. although japanese quality control is top notch and i&#x27;ve noticed the vietnamese ones have been recalled a few times</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make your eyes feel like they&#x27;re brand new, wake you up, and whitens your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Straight up painful at times; do not overuse.</li>
    <li> These eye drops are like peppermint drops for the eyes. Very refreshing, especially when your eyes are very tired or stressed.</li>
    <li> Item came long before shipping estimate date.&lt;br /&gt;Original packaging, great product.&lt;br /&gt;The sting doesn&#x27;t bother me that much and my eyes feel great. I spend all day staring at computer monitors and whiteboards and this really helps.&lt;br /&gt;Bonus: This seller gave me free candy. Who doesn&#x27;t like free candy?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a lifelong problem with bloodshot dry eyes, even in the morning after a good night&#x27;s rest.  Rohto Rohto worked IMMEDIATELY upon the first application, it does sting a little(nothing to get concerned about) but the product has an immediate cooling effect on my eyes and after about 3 minutes my eyes are bright, clear and well-lubricated!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Believe me, I&#x27;ve tried scores of U.S. made eye products and none did the job as well as this one, Rohto Rohto is well worth the money!!!  Now I use it daily and my eyes have never felt better, thank you!!!</li>
    <li> These are very strong, I am wondering if the amount of menthol in these drops is safe for the eyes.  I like the feeling and my eyes are clear, but I&#x27;m scared to use more than a few times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are not manufactured in the USA nor tested by the FDA.  We don&#x27;t really know what we are getting, the instructions and writing on the bottle is in Chinese.  Kind of scarey to tell you the truth.</li>
    <li> Were not strong at all, more like visine than megusuri.</li>
    <li> Makes ur eyes feel refreshed but did not clear my eyes.</li>
    <li> Best eyed drop I ever use! It makes your eyes clean, you feel mint on your eyes. When your eyes get dry and redness, it is the best way for them.</li>
    <li> Rohto&#x27;s arctic drops are great - and these drops are incredible too - but while ordering the both the arctic and Z! eyedrops together, I assumed there would be 3 bottles per order of Z! drops.  I received the 3 bottles of arctic drops, and only one bottle of Z! drops.  So I paid 15$ for 3 bottles of arctic drops, and 15$ more for this one little bottle of Z! drops...???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like these eyedrops since they are a different shade of refreshing, but they are not worth the $15/bottle price tag.  I hope they lower the price on these so I can afford to buy them regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bottom line: 15$ buys you only one bottle of these, as opposed to the 3 bottles if you order rohto&#x27;s arctic</li>
    <li> This stuff is not for the feint of heart. It has a very intense peppermint feeling on your eyes. It is a little uncomfortable the first few times but my eyes adjusted and now I love it. There is a lower strength version but I highly recommend giving the PRO version a shot. These drops instantly produce real tears that soothe dry gritty eyes and will turn VERY red eyes into perfect white in about 2 minutes. (even if they are having an allergic reaction to some certain green plant matter) I will buy the the Z! PRO Eye Drops again and again.</li>
    <li> Ok, perhaps that&#x27;s a little ...disingenuous, but seriously, these are amazing. I&#x27;ve been suffering from red, scratchy eyes with the prevalent Texas allergies and with a single use that was nailed. Nothing else has worked. I&#x27;d swear my eyes were sharper after the fact too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> BE CAREFUL NOT TO USE ROHTO LONG TERM. Rohto eyedrops work well for temporary occasions, but they are vasoconstrictors which will have adverse effects on the blood vessels in your eyes when you use them on a long term basis. They will make the redness worse if you use them too often.</li>
    <li> I always used FX NEO‘s products, but I could not buy it in US， so I tried this one，and I found they had the same function！</li>
    <li> If you like minty fresh feeling in your eyes, with strong lubrication. These are for you. They will burn. You will cry. And then your eyes will feel great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also think there&#x27;s a possibility for acting, since you definitely cry for real, and you cry a lot. At least I do. Maybe I&#x27;m a wimp. But I keep putting them in my eyes!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as &amp;#34;crazy&amp;#34; as some reviewers have suggested, but it certainly is a refreshing blast to the eye.  I use it at least once per day just for fun :-)</li>
    <li> These drops really stung my eyes.  I did not see any improvement in redness.</li>
    <li> Ok some reviews might sound exaggerated but this thing works way better than I thought. I take medication that makes my eyes dry and red, so I&#x27;ve been trying different drops for a while. Stumbled on this and gave it a shot. First, I love the burning sensations, feels like it&#x27;s working. Then my eyes becomes quite comfortable for a while which is great...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the real value in this is for my asian flush! When I drink my eyes go ridiculously red, to the point that people get worried and asked me if I&#x27;m ok. Just tried it now seriously I feel like my eyes are like normal person&#x27;s. Don&#x27;t care what people say, if you have this problem it&#x27;s an amazingly effective solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a bit drunk writing this, but I&#x27;m so excited! Back to drinking...</li>
    <li> This is the most &amp;#34;minty&amp;#34; eye drops I ever tried. If you like the sensation...it feels very clean and refreshing. This is my go to eye drops. Case is also very easy to use.</li>
    <li> So worth it! These eye drops really reawaken my eyes after a long night of studying when I just can&#x27;t keep my eyes open any longer.</li>
    <li> The first time I used these was at the Tokyo airport. My nose started to run and I felt like I was blinded; I thought I poured mouthwash into my eyes. Then came a mixed state of confusion and euphoria. My eyes finally were able to open and I saw the world clearer than ever before. It was like I lent my eyes to the devil, only for angels to steal and return them to me with some kind proverbial superpower that they never before had. Please, give these a try. Give them a couple tries. You&#x27;ll give up your mortality, but you&#x27;ll be reborn into something bigger.</li>
    <li> Burns like hell but love how my eyes feel after wards.</li>
    <li> First time I tried it I just wanted to see how it worked. It felt like I got a bit of astringent and mouthwash in my eye. Didn&#x27;t see any difference.  The next few days I had some allergy issues and tried it again. Wow is all I have to say! Well wow and it made my itchy/dry/red eye problems go away lickety-split. Worked almost all day and when you have crazy eye mugoo you don&#x27;t even mind the momentary sting because of the relief I felt. Plus I had really white eyes after. Amazing!</li>
    <li> I heard about these from some random post on reddit where the guy was saying that students in Japan use these eye drops to keep them alert. I&#x27;m a physics student and I&#x27;m not really a morning guy, and I&#x27;m often working on problems well past midnight so these sounded perfect for me. These things are like a cold shower for your eyes, shocking for a moment but incredibly refreshing. This property aside, they are very good at clearing my red eyes from allergies and stuff. These are the only eye drops I&#x27;ll be using from now on.</li>
    <li> These eye drops have ruined me for all other eye drops. I ran out about two weeks ago and had to resort to Visine instead while waiting for more to arrive, and there&#x27;s just no comparison. Some of these reviews are a bit hyperbolic in terms of the drops&#x27; effect (they do have a menthol-esque sting to them, but it&#x27;s not that painful), but they are refreshing and do result in lovely white scleras. My morning routine wasn&#x27;t the same without them. This is my first time using the Z! (very jazzy container), but they seem great, and I&#x27;ve also enjoyed the Arctic and the Ice versions.</li>
    <li> It burned my eyes so bad I could not use it.</li>
    <li> They burn!  I understand that the drops are especially strong, but I couldn&#x27;t handle them.  I bought them for my wedding to ensure my eyes were white for photos.  I tried them 3 times before the wedding, but each time they burned so bad that my eyes started watering, causing my eyes to redden and negating all benefits.  I suppose my eyes were a little whiter 10 minutes later, but it was hard to tell.</li>
    <li> I have been a huge fan of the green rohtos since about sophomore or jr year of high school, 6-7 years ago?. I recently found these on amazon to see if the eye drops were cheaper on here than in say cvs or walgreens.  These are a bit more expensive, but literally, doesn&#x27;t burn as much, but feels about 2-3x more refreshing.  I felt like there was an ice cube sitting on my eye! i don&#x27;t care if your eyes have been painted red, these will turn them white.  helps me in the morning at work too, wakes me up. def helps after extra curricular activities too. thumbs up! i will be buying more once i get half way</li>
    <li> Unlike other poor reviews, I am not daunted by the initial sting. I purchased these drops because  suffer from chronic dry eyes. These do nothing to improve it. For about five minutes after use my eyes feel great but then return to their previous state. They provide less relief than a generic rewetting drop. They also do not relieve any yellowing of the sclera at all. I&#x27;m not even convinced they reduce redness.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s addictive, makes my eyes feel so good.</li>
    <li> great product i love it</li>
    <li> I love a lil hydrochloric acid in my eyes when ive been playing gta5  too long to jolt my eyes and get rid of that pesky pre stroke headache in the back of my eye. the only reason it doesnt have 5 stars is that after 2 times in a 6 hr period the skin around my eyes feels dry.&lt;br /&gt;PS:I cant tell if Im tearing up from acid in my eye or crying from the pain of acid in my eye but either way the excess of tears hydrates the eye nicely.</li>
    <li> WONDERFUL PRODUCT - RECIEVED AS PROMISED</li>
    <li> It stings at first by each time you use it the sting seems less.&lt;br /&gt;It does have this minty feeling on your eyes , and does get the red out.</li>
    <li> FIRST i FELL BACK ON BED, EYES ON FIRE, THEN it slowed down and lo and behold my eyes were so clear, amazing</li>
    <li> The eyedrops are very refreshing and if you have ever had really minty gum and drank ice cold water for that icy, minty feeling then it&#x27;s the same thing for your eyes. Feels great!</li>
    <li> Very cooling but lost it after 2 days because it&#x27;s so tiny... :(</li>
    <li> These are fantastic! I love them, this product beats the heck out of clear eyes, or visine! I work at a desk staring into a computer all day and sometimes into the night, and man alive, I love these eye drops for when my eyes get tired! Just fantastic eye drops, nothing bad to say about them at all!</li>
    <li> I suffer from chronic dry eyes! I started using these drops 2 months ago. I was so tired of always having red, tired eyes. They felt scratchy all the time! I was nervous about these eyedrops because I could not read the label, it is all in Japanese. They do sting at first for about 3 minutes, but 4 minutes goes by and my eyes feel clean and refreshed and not scratchy! After about 7 minutes I was shocked at how white the whites of my eyes are. They have not been that white for a long time. I have used Patanol before and that made my eyes clear, but, it was a prescription. I love these eye drops. I use them 3 times a day and that seems to be enough to keep my eyes feeling great. I just hope they keep working, because I am going to keep using them.</li>
    <li> Rather pricey but I&#x27;m starting to like them more and more. Cool square package - nice design that is easy to carry around, and&lt;br /&gt;no danger of leaking.&lt;br /&gt;The drops actually are a little startling when you first use them, there is some kind of strong almost stinging minty effect, but they do clear&lt;br /&gt;up the eyes. I might give them five stars after I get used to the &amp;#34;zing&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Received these because I wanted a step up from the rhoto ice eye drops. These out did my expectations! Well done!</li>
    <li> FYI, Place drops in eyes prior  to make-up..otherwise your make up will smear... They provide a refreshing, clean, cool feeling..it really takes the red out, my eyes feel alive again and I can actually see the difference in  my eyes in about 3 minutes. It&#x27;s definitely a different feeling for your eyes in a good way..</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really see the difference between these and the Arctic ones, except that these are from Japan. The arctic drops are much easier to get so that&#x27;s why this gets a 4 star.</li>
    <li> in general, I like it. It is shipped from Japan, so it takes a few weeks to reach me.</li>
    <li> These are beyond intense. The first time I put a drop in my eye it brought some pain and a few swear words. The box is in what I assume is Japanese. It would be cool to see what their warnings say. It should tell you that it actually does hurt a little when you first put the drop in. But a few seconds later, it feels incredibly fresh and invigorating. These drops for tired eyes gives sort of the freshness that comes with brushing your teeth when you really need to brush them, then using mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no doubt that these are not for everyone. However, they are just what I need to perk up my tired eyes after a long day of too much coffee.</li>
    <li> Nothing special.  Stings and didn&#x27;t make a big difference.  I don&#x27;t know what the rave reviews are about.</li>
    <li> Oh man, these are so good!&lt;br /&gt;But warning: they are stronger than the American &amp;#34;Ice&amp;#34; versions, so use only if you can stand those.</li>
    <li> I have very dry eyes. I work in tech, and spend 12+ hours a day staring at various screens. Rohto&#x27;s have been a godsend to me for years now, and their new Z! Pro (or whatever they&#x27;re called) are awesome! Gone is the oval bottle, for a new diamond shape and new packaging. They feel just as refreshing, and possibly a little cooler than the &amp;#34;Ice&amp;#34; Rohtos I used to use (silver cap).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, hard to find but the best out there.</li>
    <li> I  love  the  Rohto  products  and  yes they  burn  but your  eeyes  wake  up  and  you  loose  that  tired  feeling .Also  great  if you  spend  all  day  at  computer  too .</li>
    <li> Just got this and yes, it gives eyes a &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; feeling for hours. It also burns for 30 seconds when first put in.</li>
    <li> I was surprised by how much these eye drops burned my eyes. I did not realize that was a &amp;#34; perk &amp;#34; to some users. Anyway, if you want minty fresh eyes, this is the product for you. The burning sensation subsides after about 15 min., but it feels weird. All of the info. on the box is in Japanese. I panicked at first, thinking I had put breath drops in my eyes by accident. I won&#x27;t use these again because I don&#x27;t know what is in them, and they are not comfortable to use. The bottle design is pure genius though, I wish other company&#x27;s would change their bottle design to this one. They are really easy to use, and they don&#x27;t just pool out of your eyes like Visine.</li>
    <li> Love the minty feeling. Vision was refreshed &amp; clear afterward.  Doesnt burn as much as many say. love it!</li>
    <li> Very COOL feeling, pardon the pun,,, the reviewer that described it as icy breath mints for your eyes was right on!</li>
    <li> Ok so ill be honest. I bought this product just because i wanted to know wtf this whole menthol feeling was about. its honestly NOT great. in my opinion. BUT, to be fair, once the pain goes away(45-60 seconds) my eyes are left feeling pretty darn good. I sit in front of a computer all day, and my eyes get pretty tired. A single drop in both eyes, gets me back on track.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend you at least give it a shot. The product BURNS like hell, to the point where you can&#x27;t leave your eye open. but its worth it to me for the relief. 4 star because the relief could last longer. My only complaint is that the relief does not last as long as i would like.</li>
    <li> Had redness in eyes due to long peroids of time spent on the computer, these eye drops relieves the redness and the dryness!</li>
    <li> I read the other reviews and so when I put this in my eye I was at first disappointed and not impressed. 5 seconds later, HOLY****. It&#x27;s as if someone was pouring alcohol over your eye after having thousands of small cuts on it or something. It felt cool and hot at the same time and makes your eyes feel super minty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 minutes after taking the drops, my eyes were the whitest I have ever seen them. I have suffered from chronic yellowish red eyes my entire life and no matter how much sleep or water i drink they always get irritated. Other eye drops don&#x27;t do anything. These are literally heaven eye drops or something?!? I instantly look 15% more attractive just by using these. Going to stock up to make sure I never run out in case they take them off the market!</li>
    <li> For those that are scared to death of putting this in their eyes (as I was after reading up on these &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; drops...isn&#x27;t that what &amp;#34;Pro&amp;#34; means? ;p), I&#x27;m here to report that I haven&#x27;t tried any of the other formulations from Rohto, however it seems it wasn&#x27;t necessary to &#x27;level up&#x27; in order to experience the benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you let a droplet fall into each of your eyes (however many you have), it feels like you&#x27;re enjoying/savoring a refreshing and powerful breath mint (think more old-school Binaca and Altoids as opposed to new-school versions or Mentos mints)...only it&#x27;s your eyes enjoying them and not your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That feeling, alone, is enough to make me like the product and give it 4.5-stars, as I was about to, but I also remembered that the longer-term effectiveness (over 4 hours) is - while surprisingly subtle, given the strong initial application sensation - fantastic. I wake up in the morning to extremely comfortable and, dare I say, brighter and whiter eyes. And during the day, I will re-apply a maximum of 2 times, as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The aforementioned, as well as the fact that one is inhibited from rating products on .5-incremental bases is why these get a 5-star in my book. That being said, I think most everything can be improved. With such a small bottle, I don&#x27;t want to have to re-apply at all during a day. And I&#x27;d love to know that I&#x27;m not damaging my eyes, and/or causing resistance to any and all eye drops (is there some natural/organic formulation that actually provides these dramatic results, but also contributes to the health and functioning of our precious eyes?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for this, even though I&#x27;m Japanese, I don&#x27;t know how to speak/read fluently, so I don&#x27;t know if this is actually good for my eyes (and/or at least inert) or not. So, this does concern me but I plan to study up on it further. If you&#x27;d like to keep up with the findings, PM me, and I&#x27;ll put you on an &amp;#34;update email list.&amp;#34; :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My credentials for this product review: This, all coming from someone who runs out of Visine, Clear Eyes, and Kroger brands in about 2-3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Btw, I don&#x27;t comment much, but I am a voracious reader, so I know to expect possible lash back on my review for the confession of how eye-drop dependent I am...So this part is for those who feel the need to say something to me about it...Thank you for your well-thought out opinion. Unfortunately, at this time, I don&#x27;t care to hear if you agree with me or not. But, I&#x27;m sure someone else does. So, go find them and have a much more satisfying conversation and day!)</li>
    <li> It stings at first, but dear god does the refreshing feeling make it worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I work long hours and wear contacts so my eyes get irritated and give me headaches sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;I am a circle lense/western contacts wearer that works in front of a computer for very long stretches of time.&lt;br /&gt;These make it bearable to get through the day! Just make sure you take out your lenses prior to use and leave them off for 8&lt;br /&gt;minutes or so before you put them back in. :)</li>
    <li> Works great, but they BURN :(</li>
    <li> great eyedrops. I use Rohto V often this deft was the original eyedrops that got me hooked. I only use once in awhile. They&#x27;re definitely stronger than the green V bottle; like ice cube on your eyeballs for effect ;) Better than the V ice, because that version dries my eyes. a tad pricey but worth it imo.</li>
    <li> The best product among the Japanese brand! I really love it and strongly recommend to everyone who wants to refresh your eyes!</li>
    <li> Love this product, didn&#x27;t burn like most said, but will buy again. Made my eyes feel wonderful... Didn&#x27;t make whites of my eyes whiter, but guess you can&#x27;t have everything. Best product or the eyes yet :)</li>
    <li> Burns like a mother&amp;^%$%^&amp; -  but it will make the whites of your eyes clearer than Kim Kardash&#x27;s paper on an essay test.</li>
    <li> Love these They work amazingly</li>
    <li> OMG thought i was blind then i saw the world</li>
    <li> Got these eye drops after trying out a friends. They work like eye drops, they work very well , they have more of a burn feeling then the normal eye drops. 5  out of 5 stars</li>
    <li> I routinely use Rohto Arctic (silver cap) and Ice (blue cap), and was expecting these drops to be stronger. Surprisingly I found the Z! Pro drops to be less discomforting than Arctic and I was not \\&quot;blinded\\&quot; at all by them and was able to see immediately after using them, though my eyes did water just a bit. They were not painful and have a much nicer longer lasting cooling sensation than any other drop I have tried. Z! Pro defiantly will remove EVERY trace of redness from your eyes. If you are a Rohto veteran you have no reason to fear these despite the scary reviews around the web. They are great! If you have never used Rhoto drops, try Cool (green cap) first and work up to them.</li>
    <li> I love these eye drops. I&#x27;ve ordered them twice already. They get all the red out with just one drop in each eye. Your eyes look crisp and white. I will always used these drops only! Definitely recommend if you have red and / or tired eyes.</li>
    <li> I recently started wearing circle lenses because of cosplaying, and these eye drops are a lifesaver! I tried using them at first without wearing my circle lenses and that was a HUGE MISTAKE. They made my eyes water and burn, although after the initial burn, my eyes did feel hydrated. It was just unexpected, and all my tearing up made my eyeliner run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used them with my circle lenses, and there is still a burn, but more of a light stinging that quickly goes away. They work wonderfully to relieve my irritated eyes, in addition to making them seem brighter.</li>
    <li> My husband said it&#x27;s a great eye drops. Very cool feeling</li>
    <li> I believe these are the strongest Rohto eyedrops available. They leave me teary eyed for a couple of minutes, so don&#x27;t use them around others if you&#x27;re trying to be discreet. A nice strong feeling though that feels like a punch to the eye sockets if you do it right.</li>
    <li> they work good and make it feel like your eyelids are floating if your into that type of thing ..</li>
    <li> At first, I was a little skeptical because nothing on the bottle nor the packaging is in English. I will say at first it burns a little, but then a cool minty sensation kicks in. After about a minute, your eyes are very clear and refreshing.</li>
    <li> Multi relief for strained eyes.  Be fore warned, if you have not used ROHTO drops before, many first time users will be hit with a sensation of cold refreshment upon using the drops.  I believe it may have to do with the menthol the drops contain.  This particular model is apparently the highest level of &#x27;refreshing&#x27; that ROHTO has, and I recommend starting with the green or blue tops before graduating to this JDM offering.</li>
    <li> These are the Rhotos of Rhotos. The cleanse is intense and amazing. Definitely worth the buy and shipping so if you want the ultimate in menthol this is it.</li>
    <li> Burns like a mother. I&#x27;ve used colored contacts and other types of eye drops, but this literally feels like dropping peppermint oil straight into your eye.  I can&#x27;t imagine why anyone would think this feels good. However, my eyes do look and feel a little glassier and cleaner once the pain is over. I can notice a difference in the look of my eyes, so I may use it for special occasions.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t do anything to sooth your eyes, and it doesn&#x27;t even reduce redness, but luckily it stings really bad when you apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re wondering what my pain tolerance is; I enjoy using an epilator, and have teenager children that I love.</li>
    <li> None of the over the top reviews are exaggerated. These drops are amazing. A minute of burning then refreshed eyes and oddly enough, sharper vision.</li>
    <li> Great eye refreshment ! Very cool sensation :D</li>
    <li> They really stung--I had to keep my eyes shut for a good five minutes after putting them in.  It would&#x27;ve been worth it if they got the red out.  But sadly, no.  Absolutely no difference.  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> My eyes get dry and uncomfortable wearing contacts after like 2 hours but I wear them for 6, when I am able to I take them out and my eyes feel like th need to be rubbed because they are so stressed and red and dry. I put these drops in and lay down and experience Antarctica, I feel as though I am pouring minty mouth wash into my eye it is amazing and I want to feel this way forever to escape my life of contact lense use</li>
    <li> Works within 5 minutes. Even works on under eye bags a little. There is no equal to this eye drop.</li>
    <li> I love this one, it is not too strong for me personally. The shipping was very fast.</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant since these are pricey compared to drugstore drops and the minty-ness burning my eyes. It was actually extremely refreshing!  My eyes feel the least dry after the first time using them that I can remember, and unlike drugstore eye drops, it lasts. My eyesight is clearer as well. My eye whites seem brighter to me, though it didn&#x27;t take every bit of the red out it took away enough for me to be very pleased. I&#x27;ll never use a Visine or Clear Eyes again. I want to try more types of these Rohto or Japanese eye drops, these are wonderful.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. It does exactly what it says it will. Package arrived on time and intact.</li>
    <li> Not working. Like pouring acid in eyes and only keep the re-freshness for about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li> Wow are these powerful eye drops! I love them! They will definitely wake up tired eyes. But if you don&#x27;t like the intense cooling effect you might want to avoid them. But that is my favorite part about them. They make your eyes more white and the cooling sensation is longer lasting compared to some others.</li>
    <li> Loving these eye drops - Wife and I both love em - they really freshen up your eyes - have a slight sting for the first 5 seconds but nothing intolerable. My eyes seem wider awake or more open - for me they do make my eyes whiter and less tired. Don&#x27;t be scared because of the reviews telling you of intense pain and horrors... don&#x27;t get me wrong its not Visine or a re wetting drop but its total eye freshness.</li>
    <li> Yes it stings but it feels so good after. My eyes are so white and clear! This is my first time ordering this brand and I have to say I do like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only one little thing that i dint like was the shipping time (about 2 weeks) but I cant blame them because I ordered direct from Japan. I didnt realize it so it was my own fault but now that I know where it ships from I have no problem ordering form them again because the product works!</li>
    <li> Love the packaging and the square container. The product works well. Not sure if it&#x27;s worth almost twice what my regular Rohto drops cost.</li>
    <li> Rohto drops of any formulation won&#x27;t get rid of an eye infection such as conjunctivitis....fact! However for everyday use for dry eyes or an &#x27;eye spritz&#x27; these drops really will give your eyes a boost and contract the vascular blood vessels in your eyes without any permanent effects. i.e. get rid of dry eyes &#x27;red-eye&#x27;. Many people live with dry eye syndromes/reduced tears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what it would be like for contact-lens wearer&#x27;s - be wary!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These drops are simply the best product after a day at the office looking at screens etc., and for preparing for a good night out. Many people have commented on how clear my eyes are after applying these drops when out socialising after work. This company has been around for many years and this product &#x27;zings&#x27; your eyes into shape with the ingredients like Menthol in them. Yes, your nose may stream immediately after use. I find it a pleasant and uplifting sensation. Can&#x27;t say more apart from I&#x27;ve been using these drops since they became &#x27;famous&#x27; for clubbing in the late 80&#x27;s/90&#x27;s. No adverse effects noted by me, although I do use them sparingly. A bit like anything in this world...too much of anything perhaps isn&#x27;t great, daily? Who knows. These drops do the &#x27;bright eye&#x27; refresh better than any drops like Visine, Murine or Optrex ever did.</li>
    <li> These drops burned my eyes so horribly I could not use them. I wasted my money!</li>
    <li> I look at screens more than 6 hours per day at work. Have dried countless brand of stress relieving eye drops, in the last 8 years. This one beats them all. Purchased a bunch for family and friends.</li>
    <li> Very refreshing. .i love it</li>
    <li> Burns like he&#x27;ll but nothing works better for me.  I would go through tons of other eyedropper till I found this one.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I&#x27;m actually addicted to it. I&#x27;m in the medical field and have to be with patients for &amp;#62;8 hours a day, needless to say, my contacts get irritated. These drops ALWAYS do the trick. I have bottles all over the house. GREAT product for contact wearers.</li>
    <li> Waste of money.  Does not work.</li>
    <li> It was ok. Couldn&#x27;t really see any difference to the whites of my eyes but my eyes did feel fresh.</li>
    <li> Wow! Honestly I just ordered this March 2,2015 got it yesterday March 4 2015! Ok so how do my eyes like this stuff ,all I can say honestly is bye bye VISINE AND CLEAR EYES AND HELLO TO ROHTO PRO Z! My eye never have been so white like this, it&#x27;s like I have new eyeballs Lol! But again coming from an honest review this stuff is strong, it doesn&#x27;t burn , it just feels like super minty, my eyes started to blink and a natural instinct makes you wanna jump up and down and be like omg what did I just put in my eyes but literally seconds later u start opening your eyes and it&#x27;s like everything seemed crystal clear. My eyes even got more noticed more than the usual . Honestly I know your like should I get it or not and again honestly get it and you will not regret this purchase. I&#x27;m actually gonna order one to keep at the office since I&#x27;m on a computer 8 hours a day.</li>
    <li> They did make my eyes feel wide awake, but did not help with the redness at all.  I would probably not purchase these again.</li>
    <li> Had to order two different ones to find the right one, but this&lt;br /&gt;eye-burning, tear producing astringent really makes my&lt;br /&gt;computer tired eyes feel much better.</li>
    <li> Works great, despite the lack of English-language directions!</li>
