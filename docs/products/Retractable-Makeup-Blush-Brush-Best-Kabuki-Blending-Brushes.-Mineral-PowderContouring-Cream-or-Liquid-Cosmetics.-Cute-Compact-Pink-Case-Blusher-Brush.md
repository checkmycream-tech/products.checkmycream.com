      <li>After the reviews and the &amp;#34; how to properly use your brush to get the most out of your brush&amp;#34; email I thought hmm looking forward to getting this item.</li>
      <li>It is dense enough but one thing I will say is that I&#x27;ve had kabuki brushes with much better blending abilities.</li>
      <li>and I love how shiny it is I would definitely buy another one</li>
      <li>It will definitely be in my staple because it is so travel friendly!</li>

      <li>This is a pretty nice little brush.  </li>
      <li>I use it pretty rarely, but so far its holding up and hasn&#x27;t lost any bristles, etc.</li>
      <li>The actual brush is fine.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s soft, dense, and picks up plenty of power product.</li>
      <li>Soft bristles and lightweight.  </li>
      <li>and I was surprised that it was a larger brushhead than I had anticipated!&lt;br</li>
      <li>The handle, sleeve and cap are made out of a thin, lightweight metal which means it is better protected.</li>
      <li>When you are done with it simply pull the sleeve back up over the brush, replace the cap and push it back down to its original, compact size.</li>

    <li> It was really soft and the case seems very sturdy. I love how it retracts to make sure you do not ruin the brush when you put the cap on. It will definitely be in my staple because it is so travel friendly!</li>
    <li> This is a pretty nice little brush.  It&#x27;s not the nicest I&#x27;ve ever tried by any means, but it&#x27;s pretty nice for having in your makeup bag for travel purposes.  It&#x27;s not about to replace any of my other brushes, but for a backup brush, you can&#x27;t beat it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush it&#x27;s pretty soft and it&#x27;s pretty easy to close and open without messing the brush up.  I wouldn&#x27;t really say it&#x27;s retractable, it&#x27;s the metal piece that moves up and down, It doesn&#x27;t twist down, the piece just pulls up and down (I hope you understand, I feel I&#x27;m not conveying myself well...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need a brush for travel, this is a pretty good one.  I actually have a name brand brush that&#x27;s similar in style and this works just as well as the name brand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**  Promo received for review purposes</li>
    <li> This is a simple retractable brush. I really like it. It&#x27;s soft, dense, and picks up plenty of power product. It&#x27;s easy to close and throw in your purse. The lid stays on very well. It&#x27;s a pretty good brush if you want something simple and reasonably priced. This brush would be great for travel because of its compact size.</li>
    <li> Love it, supper soft and easy fit in my makeup bag for those on the go touch up. Beautiful color choice and I love how shiny it is I would definitely buy another one if I had to or one for a gift</li>
    <li> This brush works great!  Easy to use.  It applies my blush evenly and beautifully every time!  And so convenient for when im on the go. ..i can just toss it in my make up bag and not have to worry about it getting dirty or messed up. Love it!</li>
    <li> Super nice quality. No stray bristles. Very soft and fluffy. Compact and sleek design, perfect for purses or traveling! I am happy to recieve this item to review!</li>
    <li> great brush for everyday make up bag</li>
    <li> Love the color of this! The brush itself is very soft. The packaging is a bit loose but it doesn&#x27;t effect the use of the brush. *sample provided for review*</li>
    <li> Not going to replace my normal powder brush but it&#x27;s great to travel with</li>
    <li> I love this brush. It is way better then I had expected it very soft and works well for loose powders.</li>
    <li> This is a great makeup brush especially for travel or to keep in your purse. Not only is this brush great quality but it also looks great. I use it for makeup touch ups every day I am out of the house.</li>
    <li> Soft bristles and lightweight.  I had to squeeze the cap a little because the cap kept falling off.  That did the trick and the cap stays on.</li>
    <li> Very nice and very portable applicator.  The fact that it retracts helps to keep it clean and practically germ-free.  The metal could be a little stronger, though, in order to better support the enclosed brush.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed.  Good size &amp; texture.  Well made.  Works well.</li>
    <li> Portable, and haven&#x27;t lost a hair out of it yet. I use it to apply loose powder and it&#x27;s perfect for that job. Easy to clean as well.</li>
    <li> Good product for travel but isnt a quality product. You will not have this for years to come. Bristles fall out some and the brush itself isnt secure in the outer shell.</li>
    <li> I got this brush after seeing a post about it on my facebook and I am glad I purchased it. This travel brush is great. the quality is so nice. The brush is very well put together and th brissles are nice and soft but still dense which is hard to find. if you care a makeup case in your bag this is a great addition to have in your bag.</li>
    <li> What a great product!  It came quickly, was packaged well and I was surprised that it was a larger brushhead than I had anticipated!&lt;br /&gt;The color is cool too.  It opens and closes with little effort.  Great for everyday use and travel.  I use it everyday and love it.</li>
    <li> After the reviews and the &amp;#34; how to properly use your brush to get the most out of your brush&amp;#34; email I thought hmm looking forward to getting this item. Within 5 if that long, minutes the stupid brush was broken. All I did was take the cover off.  I don&#x27;t consider myself some heavy handed wrestler chic or nothing just an average girl trying to touch up face powder.  I was so tight I had to return this and get all my money back.</li>
    <li> A very nice brush. It&#x27;s about 2 times wider than most lipstick tubes.</li>
    <li> Really great brush! Perfect for travel!</li>
    <li> Looks just like the picture. The brush is VERY soft. This is perfect for blush and it&#x27;s the perfect size to put in a make-up bag or what not.</li>
    <li> This Kabuki is great for on the go. I travel a lot, so I always like having travel ready luggage and this is permanently in my bags.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always looking for good quality travel brushes that won&#x27;t break the bank. This covers everything I have been looking for. It is cute, it is very durable and the brush is very soft. Most travel brushes are scratchy but this is far from it. It retracts easily and everything flows together smoothly. I keep this in my purse for touchups. This product was provided for review purposes but all opinions are based on my personal experience.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best brushes that I have gotten to review.The bristles are nice and soft and it is full, unlike some brushes that do not have sufficient amount of bristles in the tip. Not only is it cute and compact.. it is pink, which is one of my favorite colors! I would recommend this to all my beauty queens as a handy Kabuki brush you can keep right in your purse. A good buy at a good price!</li>
    <li> nice brush.  Def gets the job done with no problem.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a good retractable brush for a while now and have finally found it! I love this brush! It is soft and full! It also is very compact. I don&#x27;t have to worry about it getting bent up or smashed in my makeup bag.  It is very easy to use. You simply pull the cap off and push the retractable part down and bam!! There is your brush. When you are done with it simply pull the sleeve back up over the brush, replace the cap and push it back down to its original, compact size. It&#x27;s that simple!  Being retractable adds a lot of security and mobility that you don&#x27;t have with a regular makeup brush.  Besides this brush is super cute! The pinkish, reddish color is beautiful! The handle, sleeve and cap are made out of a thin, lightweight metal which means it is better protected. I love this brush and recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> Good for my purse. I use it pretty rarely, but so far its holding up and hasn&#x27;t lost any bristles, etc.</li>
    <li> I have never really been a fan of retractable brushes as I find they break easily or their retractable mechanism doesn&#x27;t work well but this brush has a nifty and very functional retractable system. It is the size of a lipstick container and fits perfectly in your purse or a travel kit. The actual brush is fine. It is not the softest or silkiest I&#x27;ve used but it doesn&#x27;t feel scratchy against your face. It is dense enough but one thing I will say is that I&#x27;ve had kabuki brushes with much better blending abilities. I think this brush is good for on the go but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it as your primary face brush.</li>
