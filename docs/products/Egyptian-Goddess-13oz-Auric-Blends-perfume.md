      <li>I love this oil.</li>
      <li>I remember this brand of EG being much better.</li>
      <li>Its not to strong</li>
      <li>When I first got it it was strong but had a nice smell to it.</li>
      <li>Auric Blends is wonderful and consistent for the last 19 years!!!</li>
      <li>I was really hoping I would be one of the lucky ones to receive a good batch.</li>
      <li>massage oil available in an 8oz pump.</li>
      <li>Sweet light smell, rolls on smoothly.</li>
      <li>The fragrance inherent to this oil is amazing but must be either from an old batch or somehow diluted.</li>
      <li>I love the scent but it fades so fast.</li>
      <li>I have had people tell me you smell good when I only apply it once a day !</li>
      <li>I love the scent thanks for having the product.</li>
      <li>I began wearing Egyptian Goddess in High School and still absolutely love this smell.</li>
      <li>It showed up very fast!</li>
      <li>Nice, but I prefer other oils more.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not even going to bother trying to return and ask for a refund, it isn&#x27;t worth my time.</li>
      <li>I adore this soft but sexy scent.</li>
      <li>Several years ago, I kept buying tubes that didn&#x27;t smell as potent</li>
      <li>2nd favorite scent.</li>
      <li>I would love it if it was stronger or the scent last longer.</li>
      <li>When I first opened it, I put some on my wrist.</li>
      <li>I first started wearing this about 10 years ago, after picking up a bottle in San Francisco.  </li>
      <li>I love the scent, I just wish it would last longer on my skin.</li>
      <li>This was the perfume she wore on our first date</li>
      <li>Also fast shipping was a plus!</li>
      <li>Its a really warm feeling scent, clean and long lasting.</li>
      <li>My husband said it was so light he could barely smell it.</li>
      <li>love the scent of Egyptian Goddess, have been using it for a very long time and always get compliments on it.</li>
      <li>It was my new second favorite.</li>
      <li>I used to love the scent of the African street vendors in New York that had the Egyptian musk oils and incense.</li>
      <li>the smell is amazing, was a little nervous since I like to smell before I buy.  </li>
      <li>Bought as a gift for my mother who absolutely loves this scent.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend !</li>
      <li>This perfume oil is very fragrant.  </li>
      <li>thanks for sending so fast</li>
      <li>So, as some other reviewers noted, the first couple times I used it, it seemed to smell like the same old perfume I knew and loved.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s unique and Classic at the same time.</li>
      <li>After reading recent reviews I thought I&#x27;d order one more time to see if maybe the last batch I received was a fluke.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing it since High School....</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>And as for only 1 bottle price isn&#x27;t worth it .&lt;br</li>
      <li>I also bought the White Musk and that at least smells clean and fresh although it fades quickly.</li>
      <li>I decided to try again after buying Tea Rose for our Gnosis Center and am pleasantly surprised to find Egyptian Goddess back to its old potency.</li>
      <li>better - a little more complex and feminine smelling.compare</li>
      <li>I have bought this brand many times in the past.</li>
      <li>Bio Source Naturals has the same exact (Egyptian Musk)</li>
      <li>I wonder how old these oils are that they sell online.</li>
      <li>Why dies Egyptian goddess sometimes completely lose its scent while still in the bottle??  </li>
      <li>My wife was pleasantly surprised.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My favorite scent thank you</li>
    <li> Great product. I just love this scent.  Works Well for men or women...</li>
    <li> I thought my sense of smell was dying on me. When I first got it it was strong but had a nice smell to it. It was my new second favorite. I hadn&#x27;t used it in a couple of months but today I opened the bottle and couldn&#x27;t smell anything. My husband said it was so light he could barely smell it. I&#x27;ve never had a perfume or oil that lost it&#x27;s scent. I didn&#x27;t even know it was possible. I&#x27;ll never waist money on their products again. I graciously gave it two stars because it was so nice in the beginning.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied.  I love the fragrance.  Again....Thank You.</li>
    <li> Smells different than I expected</li>
    <li> I was really hoping I would be one of the lucky ones to receive a good batch. This was not the case. I can put plain ol cooking oil on my skin instead of wearing this because it has the same effect. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> The fragrance inherent to this oil is amazing but must be either from an old batch or somehow diluted. I can say this with a degree of confidence because the reason I sought this out on Amazon was that I ran across Egyptian Godess in a small herbal shop and remember the color of the oil in the bottle being darker. Also, I tried some on at that store and the fragrance was much stronger both out of the bottle and on my skin hours later. I have to keep reapplying this one. I will keep it but will probably buy direct from Auric Blends next time.</li>
    <li> Ultimate scent- I have been using since 1992!</li>
    <li> I wish I&#x27;d read the reviews on this seller&#x27;s product prior to ordering. I&#x27;ve ordered this from another vendor and loved it.  This one is awful... absolutely no scent.  I&#x27;m SO disappointed.  I&#x27;m not even going to bother trying to return and ask for a refund, it isn&#x27;t worth my time. So &#x3D; they&#x27;re going to end up in the garbage can, a waste of money, but knowledge/experience.  I will not order from this vendor again.  Look elsewhere if you want a good product.</li>
    <li> Sweet light smell, rolls on smoothly. I put it on after I get out the shower and it works all day. You think the smell went away but it doesn&#x27;t. I have had people tell me you smell good when I only apply it once a day ! I highly recommend !</li>
    <li> Thank you:)  This has been my signature scent for nine years- the most amazing thing I have ever smelled in my life!  Also fast shipping was a plus!</li>
    <li> I have always liked this scent. It was on my wishlist for awhile now. Bought it. Immediately put it on and I could feel the tension in my head slowly fade. I&#x27;ve been so relaxed and I love how oils can do that. Its a really warm feeling scent, clean and long lasting. I want more. Cheap aroma therapy!</li>
    <li> This is my go to since I was 15 years old. Auric Blends is wonderful and consistent for the last 19 years!!!</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I had to purchase this to see what all the hype was about. I am SO disappointed. To me, this is a super-heavy, cloying, cheap, powdery floral scent that reminds me of old lady perfume - it is horrible. I put one small roll about the size of a nickel on my wrist and the stench gave me a headache after 10 minutes. Tried washing it off but it was already embedded in my shirt and I had to smell it the rest of the night. For some of the reviewers that say they can&#x27;t smell anything or the smell fades, I can&#x27;t imagine what they purchased as my stinks. I also bought the White Musk and that at least smells clean and fresh although it fades quickly. Egyptian Goddess reeks.</li>
    <li> This is the actual Auric Egyptian Goddess oil!! Very happy with this purchase after reading bad reviews of fake product from other sellers. Highly recommended! Will be purchasing again :)</li>
    <li> This musky scent is perfect for my body chemistry. My favorite. I get compliments all the time.</li>
    <li> I love this scent. I used to love the scent of the African street vendors in New York that had the Egyptian musk oils and incense. To find that delicious scent in a non-animal formula is great. I am enjoying this every day!</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t clear that there is only one bottle. I thought it will be 4 of them.  And as for only 1 bottle price isn&#x27;t worth it .&lt;br /&gt;Perfume is very nice thought.&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow does anyone knows where I can get  sandalwood fragrance?</li>
    <li> I love the scent but it fades so fast. I would love it if it was stronger or the scent last longer.</li>
    <li> The picture shows 4 bottles but only received one. I was disappointed that it wasn&#x27;t made clear that only one bottle was what you got.  Also there was no way to chose one fragrance.</li>
    <li> She loves this, I love it. This was the perfume she wore on our first date and it will always be one of my favorites. It also doesn&#x27;t aggravate my allergies, which is awesome.</li>
    <li> Where is the Egyptian Goddess I feel in love with? After reading recent reviews I thought I&#x27;d order one more time to see if maybe the last batch I received was a fluke. Nope. Boo! Hiss hiss!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve compared different oils and, I believe, this blend is Egyptian Musk parading around as Egyptian Goddess. Bio Source Naturals has the same exact (Egyptian Musk) massage oil available in an 8oz pump. It literally has the same scent and consistency.</li>
    <li> love the scent of Egyptian Goddess, have been using it for a very long time and always get compliments on it.</li>
    <li> The smell is not what I expected.  I&#x27;m one disappointed customer!</li>
    <li> Why dies Egyptian goddess sometimes completely lose its scent while still in the bottle??  When this product is still potent it&#x27;s the most beautiful smell ever but I&#x27;ve found w 2 different brands now that it doesn&#x27;t last long. Disappointing</li>
    <li> Scent is nice, but I agree with other reviewers--very faint.  I prefer Auric blends &amp;#34;Rasta&amp;#34;, which has a much stronger, sexier patchouli base.</li>
    <li> This is a feminine woodsy scent and I adore it. It&#x27;s subtle yet noticeable and everything I want! It&#x27;s also good for just about any occasion.</li>
    <li> Perfect product!  Actually what I ordered. Will order again. Thank you for allowing me to share my review.  Thank you</li>
    <li> I have bought this brand many times in the past. This is not what I was expecting. It is like cooking oil with a very light scent. Not the Egyptian Goddess I am accustomed to!</li>
    <li> I first started wearing this about 10 years ago, after picking up a bottle in San Francisco.  I&#x27;ve used several other designer perfumes, but I always keep coming back to this one.  I absolutely love the scent and you can&#x27;t go wrong with the price tag.</li>
    <li> the smell is amazing, was a little nervous since I like to smell before I buy.  No worries! smells great and is the real thing.  Amazing quickness :)  thanks for sending so fast</li>
    <li> Product could not be used. Bottle faulty. Contacted co. No response.</li>
    <li> 2nd favorite scent. Truly intoxicating. Wear it in the summer when you will be sweating slightly (eating al fresco, etc) and expect everyone around you to be sniffing in your direction! Just smells soooo good!</li>
    <li> I LOVE Egyptian Goddess and have used it for years. When I received this in the mail it smelled like burnt tires and vegetable oil. There was No Egyptian Goddess scent at all. I was so disappointed. I ended up returning it.</li>
    <li> Nice, but I prefer other oils more.  They seem to last longer than this one.  But is still a good oil.</li>
    <li> I ordered this without knowing what to expect - taking a gamble, based on the good reviews. It arrived quickly and in good shape. When I first opened it, I put some on my wrist. I was a bit turned off at first because it did sort of smell like granny perfume, but I followed the advice of other reviewers and gave it a chance to meld with my skin. After a few minutes the scent changed. It smells a lot like Egyptian musk that you would find at a perfume oil vendor, but better - a little more complex and feminine smelling.compare it to. Its just amazing and I love it! Had to change this review to 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This is a great perfume!  My boyfriend loves it and I get complimented every time I wear it. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I adore this soft but sexy scent. It&#x27;s unique and Classic at the same time. Unfortunately, I only used it for a couple of weeks before it completely lost its scent. See the picture I included. That&#x27;s how much I used before it went in the trash because it smelled just like plain carrier oil. It&#x27;s inexpensive, but not cheap enough to replace that often. It used to last so much longer. I don&#x27;t know if the formula changed or what. Really disappointed. I feel like my signature scent may as well be discontinued.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m liking this scent! I tried the Forbidden Desire scent and the Vanilla Rain scent, didn&#x27;t like the Vanilla Rain too much, but I&#x27;m liking these two other scents I have (Forbidden Desire and Egyptian Goddess).</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite perfume because of its scent and because it is an oil. I also like the roll on applicator.</li>
    <li> This perfume oil is very fragrant.  It can be worn to work or play.  Only thing I don&#x27;t like is the price.</li>
    <li> So confused by this perfume. I have been purchasing this for almost 20 years, but had not purchased it recently. Decided to ignore the reviews here on amazon as well as some comments made elsewhere about the quality of the product these days. So, as some other reviewers noted, the first couple times I used it, it seemed to smell like the same old perfume I knew and loved. The third time I used it, and every time since, the smell is OFF. The best I can explain it is that it&#x27;s Egyptian Goddess on top with burnt rubber underneath. Makes me want to cry, because my beloved perfume is no longer what it once was. Really disappointed. I don&#x27;t believe this is the seller&#x27;s fault...there are many complaints on the Auric Blends FB page about off-smelling or non-perfumed perfume. :(</li>
    <li> Lovely, my favorite perfume.</li>
    <li> This Egyptian Goddess perfume arrive in record time from Xtremek! But I think they just needed to get it out of their supply room! This stuff STINKS! I&#x27;m not kidding! The smell is cloying; I only dabbed it on the back of my thumb. At first not much odor but wait for it! OMG! The longer it&#x27;s on the stronger it gets! It made me nauseous! I could still smell the horrible scent AFTER I had washed with warm soapy water Twice!  Eyes watering, sneezing! Ugh!</li>
    <li> It has NO FRAGRANCE! Old batch maybe???</li>
    <li> Love this oil! This scent is one of my fav&#x27;s. Its not to strong but it lasts all day. It showed up very fast!</li>
    <li> I love the scent thanks for having the product.</li>
    <li> I remember this brand of EG being much better. I wonder how old these oils are that they sell online. Took a chance but, wont re purchase from this brand again.</li>
    <li> I always get compliments on this each time I wear it</li>
    <li> I began wearing Egyptian Goddess in High School and still absolutely love this smell. Several years ago, I kept buying tubes that didn&#x27;t smell as potent so I stopped buying it out of disappointment. I decided to try again after buying Tea Rose for our Gnosis Center and am pleasantly surprised to find Egyptian Goddess back to its old potency. My husband loves it too!</li>
    <li> I love this oil. I get alot of compliments when I wear it, the smell is very nice, and stays with you all day.</li>
    <li> I love the scent, I just wish it would last longer on my skin. Other than that, I really like it.</li>
    <li> This fragrance had a wonderful musky aroma.</li>
    <li> My wife was pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> This is best perfuume I ever purchased.</li>
    <li> Fabulous scent! I&#x27;ve been wearing it since High School....I&#x27;m going on 40  : ]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving a 3 stars more for packaging then anything.  The smell is not what I was expecting.  Not really liking it.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift for my mother who absolutely loves this scent. It was a hit as always.</li>
