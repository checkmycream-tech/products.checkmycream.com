      <li>It smelled like the strong cheap hair spray smell.  </li>
      <li>so this is important.</li>

      <li>It works great and lasts long.</li>
      <li>The product was the most reasonable through Amazon.</li>
      <li>seem full of chemicals</li>
      <li>i love this product as much as all the biosilk line.</li>
      <li>However, this finishing spray does a good job of calming flyaways and setting your hair, without the super stick side effects of regular hairspray.  </li>
      <li>My hair is fine and very straight.</li>
      <li>The delivery to me was exceptionally quick and packed</li>
      <li>I love all Biosilk hair products because they do not dry your hair, soft but good hold,</li>
      <li>I have shortish and super texturized hair that never seemed to want to stay put.</li>
      <li>Also, if you get caught in a wind or rainstorm, let your hair dry, then brush it out, spray it with Biosilk, and you&#x27;re good to go again.  </li>
      <li>Good product for strong, heavy hair.</li>
      <li>The firm hold is great for my hair.  </li>

      <li>Well worth the money.</li>
      <li>I think there are a lot of other good hair sprays out there.</li>
      <li>, it must have been about 6 monts ago, the price is right and the product is uncomparable.  </li>
      <li>thank you very much for your product.</li>
      <li>comes very fast in the mail  </li>

      <li>and I will keep checking your site to get more at a later date.</li>
      <li>This is the only spray that really holds and does not gum up my hair, and lasts for more than one day.  </li>

      <li>Works great on my long, fine, thin hair.</li>
      <li>Love this product, been using it for years, the new spray button design makes it a bit harder to use.</li>
      <li>This has never happened to me with any other brand, even the cheap ones.  </li>
      <li>I just started a new can</li>
      <li>I live in a humid climate.  </li>
      <li>A new hairdresser used &amp; recommended Biosilk.</li>

      <li>Love this when I want a little firmer longer lasting hold.  </li>
      <li>I like this product because it doesn&#x27;t smell super fruity like some other products do.</li>

      <li>doesnt smell natural at all.  </li>
      <li>It is non-dulling and natural looking.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> They sent me the regular hold instead of the firm hold like I ask for, so yes, I am very disappointed in it.</li>
    <li> I was working at a salon when I came across this hair spray, it is the best it holds hair but not stiff, it smells good but not over powering, the can is huge and lasts for a long time.   Last time I purchased the hair spray from amazon I picked up 3 cans I am now on the last can, it must have been about 6 monts ago, the price is right and the product is uncomparable.  don&#x27;t let this product go un-noticed.</li>
    <li> My girl friend would not live without it!</li>
    <li> Love this product, been using it for years, the new spray button design makes it a bit harder to use. I had to cut the small plastic tab underneath to make it work like the older type.</li>
    <li> This firm spray is hard to find and usually the price is  much higher than what I paid online.  I bought 2 cans and even with the shipping fee came out ahead.  The firm hold is great for my hair.  This is the only spray that really holds and does not gum up my hair, and lasts for more than one day.  One can will last me months also.  Thanks so much for carrying this.</li>
    <li> What I ordered and what I received were two different products. I ordered Biosilk Finishing Spray Firm Hold - Hair Spray and received CHI Flex Hold Firm Hold Hair Spray. I chose not to return the product received because I thought I might as well try it, the price paid ended up a great sale for the amount of hair spray in the can. The CHI Flex Hold Hair Spray does not hold the hair style for as long a period of time as the Biosilk Firm Hold. I should have made contact with the seller to see why the product was switched or if the other product was no longer being manufactured. I will still make future purchases from Amazon.com and possibly this seller.</li>
    <li> This spray smells so good and can make curly fried hair look silky shiny straight with a good flat iron.</li>
    <li> I was forced to order this product over the internet since I was unable to find it in the stores.  I am glad I could not find it in the stores because I saved money ordering it off the internet.  The product was the most reasonable through Amazon.</li>
    <li> BEST, BEST, BEST spray ever invented!!!! No other product even compares to this gold mine, not one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Depending on how you use it, it can hold anywhere from a softer look to something more dynamic. Any style! It&#x27;s my vice, my drug. I tend to generally go with a crazy, messy look, whether I dress it up or go casual. Works with my personality, and this product is amazing!!!! Been using it for bout 10-12+ yrs. My hair is naturally flat and soft, not super thick and with this stuff, I can literally hold a piece of hair, spray it and put it anywhere I want, and it stays. Or simply spray it all and &amp;#34;move&amp;#34; any parts of my hair where I want em and that&#x27;s it! My hair&#x27;s been different lengths over the yrs too, hasn&#x27;t mattered. This spray has worked like a charm any and every time!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even cut and color my own hair, have been for a few yrs now and get lots of compliments. People always asking who cuts my hair. That&#x27;s always a day lifter, BUT!...........I always tell them the same thing................I cut it myself but it wudn&#x27;t do a thing without my Biosilf finishing spray. No lie, this product is sheer perfection! Thank u Biosilk from the bottom of my heart!!!!</li>
    <li> This product is so much more than a hair spray.It also gives volume and texture without hardness or wet sticky feeling after applied.&lt;br /&gt;My hairdresser always used. Now i can get by without a hairdresser but not without my BioSilk.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> BEST hair spray Ever!!! I use this constantly. I&#x27;ve never used hair spray. Period. A new hairdresser used &amp; recommended Biosilk. So glad he did.</li>
    <li> This product smells so good. I use the same brand of shampoo and conditioner and this just adds to it! Great hold.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT WEIGHT TO THE SPRAY. NOZZEL DOES TEND TO CLOG UNLESS YOU WIPE WITH WATER OR ALCOHOL AFTER EACH USE. COMPANY SHIPPED VERY QUICKLY.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m almost done with my bottle of this hair spray and I won&#x27;t be ordering it again. I was underwhelmed by it. It wasn&#x27;t bad but I didn&#x27;t love it. It got a bit &amp;#34;crispy&amp;#34; and sticky. I think there are a lot of other good hair sprays out there.</li>
    <li> I have been having trouble finding this Biosilk hairspray as it seems to be phasing out? Cannot figure out why as all my family members love it as well. Is not heavy no buildup yet great hold. Anyhow, great price was cheaper &amp; came right to my door as scheduled! I will continue to order!</li>
    <li> This is the same spray my hairdresser uses.  It has a nice scent and does a good job of holding my fine hair.  If I had a complaint it would be the nozzle clogs up about half way through the can.  I have to take it outside, hold it upside down and spray until it becomes unclogged.  This has never happened to me with any other brand, even the cheap ones.  I don&#x27;t know why it happens to this brand; must be something different about their nozzle.  This clogging has happened on three or four cans now.  I just started a new can a couple of days ago and so far so good.</li>
    <li> I have shortish and super texturized hair that never seemed to want to stay put. I style with some surf wax and then finish the look with Biosilk Finishing spray and my hair is finally behaving! It lasts forever and is a great deal. I&#x27;ll be using this for a long long time. :)</li>
    <li> The best spray I&#x27;ve found in years.  Holds well and &amp;#34;keeps working&amp;#34; for hours.  Can spray over it and push your hair around and refresh your hairstyle later in the day.  Also, if you get caught in a wind or rainstorm, let your hair dry, then brush it out, spray it with Biosilk, and you&#x27;re good to go again.  Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> This is the best hairspray for my baby fine hair. Great in humidity. And, an all-day hold.</li>
    <li> I live in a humid climate.  This hairspray does the best job of keeping my hairstyle and yet I can comb through it when I need tol.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. This hairspray was recommended by my stylist who also recommends it to her clients living in the humid windy conditions of Miami Florida. Works great on my long, fine, thin hair.</li>
    <li> Great product and super fast delivery by this seller.</li>
    <li> afraid of using much because it smells really terrible. but using too little has little effect. doesnt smell natural at all.  seem full of chemicals</li>
    <li> I have used this for many years.  It holds  well without leaving your hair stiff.  The  only thing I do not like is you cannot find  the spray at dept stores anymore.</li>
    <li> It is an awesome hairspray and I am Addicated to it. It works great and lasts long.</li>
    <li> Just the best hair spray</li>
    <li> It was excellant at keeping water cold while we traveled.  A couple of ice cubes and the water was still cold more than 24 hrs later.</li>
    <li> I love it. it is light and yet still holds. My hair is fine and very straight. it does not build up. JC</li>
    <li> always the greatest. comes very fast in the mail  I like that part too. thank you very much for your product.</li>
    <li> great hold, works well</li>
    <li> I love all Biosilk hair products because they do not dry your hair, soft but good hold, a lot of shine&lt;br /&gt;and a nice gentle scent.  I use the Firm hold and the natural hold depending on weather and&lt;br /&gt;style for the day.</li>
    <li> My favorite hairspray.  I don&#x27;t buy anything but this.  It holds my hair all day.  The delivery to me was exceptionally quick and packed so well.  I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> Wife is very happy with the finishing spray.  That makes me very satisfied customer. :)</li>
    <li> All day hold without the crunchy feel. Love it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best hair products I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Georgiana&lt;br /&gt;gromero@sandiacasino.com</li>
    <li> Love this when I want a little firmer longer lasting hold.  It is non-dulling and natural looking. Have no complaints about it.</li>
    <li> I am not big on hairspray. I have long hair, and I find that my hair gets really snarly when I use hairspray, especially when I curl it.  However, this finishing spray does a good job of calming flyaways and setting your hair, without the super stick side effects of regular hairspray.  I&#x27;ve been using this for years.</li>
    <li> Love this product! My hairstylist uses this spray and it smells amazing as well as holds my hair in place all day! I have very curly hair and this product fights frizz all day long. By far one of my favorite brands of hair product. Amazon&#x27;s price is unbeatable!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Does not leave the hair sticky.  It holds the shape and style very well.  Would reorder any time.</li>
    <li> I tried using this a few times, very lightly, but it left my fine, thin hair dull, stiff and sticky.  A waste of money.</li>
    <li> I always look Shiny and bright.  I always use this product and my hair looks healthy and professionally styled. I always keep a spare.  It&#x27;s that important</li>
    <li> I like this product because it doesn&#x27;t smell super fruity like some other products do. I&#x27;m a guy so this is important. What you get is a nice fine spray (like mist) that locks your hair in place without flaking or making your hair crunchy. After a few minutes, there is very little scent. I&#x27;m ordering another bottle before I run out.</li>
    <li> Very good product.....you use less and it holds all day. I was buying this product at my hairdressers, which was 14.00 a can.....I found a place on the internet for 11.00 a can....very same product.....just google it..</li>
    <li> Love this hairs spray.  Doesnt weigh hair down and isnt too light either.  Just a perfect hold for my hair and it smells pretty good tooo...</li>
    <li> This is the only hair spray that holds my hair without making it look stiff and hard.  It is natural looking and I can comb or brush through my hair without pulling my hair.</li>
    <li> The the great deal I got from you and I will keep checking your site to get more at a later date.</li>
    <li> I had no idea that it was an aerosol.  I would like to return it.  How do I return it?</li>
    <li> Seldom use hair spray; very satisfied with Biosilk Finishing Spray Firm Hold</li>
    <li> The only spray I will use</li>
    <li> i love this product as much as all the biosilk line. provides firm hold and it smells wonderful. I am ordering more of this product</li>
    <li> Finishing Spray arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I chose this item because I love biosilk products.  I have tried the natural hold but not the firm hold finishing spray.  I did not like it because it did not have the good smell of biosilk.  It smelled like the strong cheap hair spray smell.  I will choose the natural hold from now on.  I wanted to exchange it but I see that option is not available.</li>
    <li> Good product for strong, heavy hair.</li>
</ol>
