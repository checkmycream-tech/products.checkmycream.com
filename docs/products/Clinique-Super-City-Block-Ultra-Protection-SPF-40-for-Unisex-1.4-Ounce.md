      <li>excellent</li>
      <li>This is a great tinted moisturizer and sunscreen all in one!  </li>
      <li>This product contains both zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, which is recommended by dermatologists to get the best benefit.</li>
      <li>I like this product because it&#x27;s so awesome</li>
      <li>Wonderful sunscreen.</li>

      <li>I love this!</li>
      <li>Love this sunscreen!  </li>
      <li>This does it all and accommodates my light colored skin just great.</li>
      <li>Never clogs my pores or causes breakouts, leaves a nice iridescent glow on my skin.</li>
      <li>But until I find 1 as good or better than SCB, I&#x27;m sticking with a proven winner.</li>
      <li>This was a great product until I found a fabulous BB cream which does so much more than this product ever could.  </li>
      <li>excellent for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>This is the best stuff on market, so far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
      <li>My skin is very light and need the every day protection.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>This stuff I love.  </li>

      <li>I love love love this product.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m also 1 of those people who&#x27;ve never been able to tolerate anything on my skin.</li>
      <li>LOVE THIS&amp;#62</li>
      <li>I probably will NOT buy this product again, and recommend others research the ingredients in it to make sure you do not have a reaction to any of them.</li>
      <li>my friends ,they love it</li>
      <li>What more could you ask for?  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s lightweight and works well, but I was still on the hunt for the perfect lotion after using it for several months.</li>
      <li>I love some clinique products, but many contain fillers that make them seem more \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; to me</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s excellent for skin protection and I always apply it under my moisturizer since it feels a bit dry.</li>
      <li>They are tried and true, great products and so consistent.  </li>
      <li>you look online, many will mention the light tint, but when I purchased it the girl did not mention it and</li>
      <li>My wife takes care of your skin from sunlight daily using the Super City Block Ultra Protection SPF 40 and has brought excellent results.</li>
      <li>It glides on smoothly, protects my face from the sun, and helps my makeup to go on more smoothly.</li>
      <li>But it can wear off easily in the heat.  </li>
      <li>easy to get even on face,love it&lt;br</li>
      <li>She strongly recommended.</li>
      <li>excellent, my wife like very much this products and similarly of the Clinique</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty light, has a nice tint which hides redness in my skin, and has no odor.</li>
      <li>it works out fine for me.</li>
      <li>For a high SPF, the consistency is great, it goes right on and blends in well.  </li>
      <li>Applies smooth and even.</li>
      <li>Goes on smoothly, and after it dries, I put on my makeup.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this for light sunscreen protection.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great coverage and can double as a primer.</li>
      <li>A great solid lotion!</li>
      <li>It does blend in and does a fabulous job of evening out my skin tone</li>
      <li>I tried everything using oil free moisturizer with spf and this product but it still happens.</li>
      <li>I love that this SPF is 40, giving me the protection I need from the hot Texas sun.</li>
      <li>No streaking, and it&#x27;s a light enough color that fair</li>
      <li>I like to use it with Clinique loose powder, which always brings great comments.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it provides excellent sunblock protection, but Elta MD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46 does too with a lot less feeling of greasiness.&lt;br</li>
      <li>i used clinique super city Block for 10 years</li>
      <li>i bought 2 of them, because i have mild skin.</li>
      <li>My wife has always sworn by sun block and has been using this tinted Super City Block (SCB) for sometime.  </li>
      <li>all my friend asked me about this super city block</li>
      <li>I am sure many other sun blocks out there -- those containing key UV protectants like zinc oxide and titanium dioxide -- are just as good.</li>
      <li>First of all, for practicality of use and because well just because!  </li>
      <li>It is pricey, but when I find something that works this well with my skin and that I use every day, the price is worth it</li>
      <li>It sinks in quickly, doesn&#x27;t make my skin oilier, which with the heat right now is amazing, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin,and I have yet to get any color on my face.</li>
      <li>Has really worked to stop skin damage!</li>
      <li>Clinique does not fail.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Therefore I would tend to use this a bit more religiously in the summer time.</li>
      <li>Another con is that lets say its really hot and you put this product out.</li>
      <li>and I find that SPF 15, 20, 25 (found in most cosmetic type face sunblock) is not enough.  </li>
      <li>I put my moisturizer on, wait several minutes for it to absorb, and then layer this on top.</li>
      <li>I am new to any kind of make-up and clueless to some of the related issues as well.</li>
      <li>I love the fact there is such a high SPF content in this product .&lt;br</li>
      <li>Let me be sure to say too that it does its job as a moisturizer; my skin does not feel dry at all with one morning application for every day use.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;However because of that it makes the product very thick.&lt;br</li>
      <li>i really appreciate it.</li>
      <li>The very thought of even rolling or spraying underarm deodorant on my armpits has always creeped me out.</li>
      <li>Also, makeup goes on much smoother with this on.  </li>
      <li>: i might be putting too much on but it looks like makeup peeling.</li>
      <li>thanks, my wife loves this item.</li>
      <li>One thing more since there is a \\&quot;tint\\&quot;, if you use it on your neck and chest be careful to rub it in thoroughly because it can stain clothing.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m used to the product, it really protect your skin</li>
      <li>I was just getting ready to see a dermatologist when I figured I had nothing to lose by trying SCB.</li>
      <li>especially now we&#x27;re getting more mature.</li>
      <li>This meaning people would only see your face as clean unless someones kissing you.</li>
      <li>This is a tinted sun block, which makes it a decent make up primer.</li>
      <li>I have very oily, sensitive skin and my cheeks are covered with acne rosacea.</li>
      <li>But it has many benefits, and I have sensitive skin and this sunscreen is one of few that I like.</li>
      <li>it absorbs into your skin leaving a very natural</li>
      <li>Clinique city block is pretty much the only sunscreen I can use on a daily basis without breaking out.</li>
      <li>The bottle&#x27;s pretty big too, I think this one will definitely last the whole summer.</li>
      <li>But why isn&#x27;t this information made clear.</li>
      <li>me interrupt myself to say that I really like this product for several reasons.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> excellent i like it i used clinique super city Block for 10 years&lt;br /&gt;and all my friend asked me about this super city block</li>
    <li> This is a tinted sun block, which makes it a decent make up primer. It does not have an overly greasy feel like other sun products, but it is also NOT water proof so it needs to be reapplied very frequently especially when outside. This product contains both zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, which is recommended by dermatologists to get the best benefit. Additionally, this product claims to have anti-oxidants in it, but does not list which antioxidants are actually in the formula.    The downside is the cost. I love some clinique products, but many contain fillers that make them seem more \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; to me-this is one of those products. I probably will NOT buy this product again, and recommend others research the ingredients in it to make sure you do not have a reaction to any of them.</li>
    <li> Cream is very thin but seems OK</li>
    <li> I wear this every day.  If I wear nothing else on my face, usually because I&#x27;m in a hurry, I use this, Clinique blush stick, and Clinique Soft Shine lipstick.  But it can wear off easily in the heat.  I like to use it with Clinique loose powder, which always brings great comments.  No streaking, and it&#x27;s a light enough color that fair (read: pale!) customers like me can use it without fear of looking like an Oompa Loompa...which was always my complaint when I used cheaper foundation.  It&#x27;s sheer enough, however, that it doesn&#x27;t add lightening color, so I can&#x27;t imagine it wouldn&#x27;t work with darker skin tone.  Another plus:  I have three generations of melanoma in my family...anything I can do to add sun protection is welcome, and this saves the step of adding a separate sunscreen underneath foundation.</li>
    <li> I love love love this product.  I&#x27;m very pale and have rosacea and I find that SPF 15, 20, 25 (found in most cosmetic type face sunblock) is not enough.  This stuff I love.  For a high SPF, the consistency is great, it goes right on and blends in well.  I had no problem with flakiness as one commenter said, nor do I find this product to have a smell.  Maybe a very faint chemical smell, but certainly nothing offensive.  It covers up the imperfections on my skin, I just wear this and maybe some powder.  The bottle&#x27;s pretty big too, I think this one will definitely last the whole summer.</li>
    <li> A great solid lotion! Clinique does not fail. They are tried and true, great products and so consistent.  Thank you Clinique!  Wish they did double or quadruple packs...</li>
    <li> I have used this stuff for at least 10 years and I haven&#x27;t aged a bit. :-)  I haven&#x27;t gotten a burn on my face since I started using it.  Also, makeup goes on much smoother with this on.  I get the spf 40 and it&#x27;s not too thick or anything.  LOVE THIS&amp;#62;  I would sacrifice other things I buy to buy this.</li>
    <li> pros : has spf and it has a little color in it so everything ( pimples, and other things that your trying to cover ) it covers.     con: i might be putting too much on but it looks like makeup peeling. I tried everything using oil free moisturizer with spf and this product but it still happens. But when I just put regular moisturizer and the product it still happens. When I put regular moisturizer then this product, then foundation it still does it. But this only shows when your really close to mirror. This meaning people would only see your face as clean unless someones kissing you. 0.- ( thats how close you have to be ) to see the makeup thing.            Another con is that lets say its really hot and you put this product out. After a few minutes it sort of wears off which it shows.    Im sort of 50 / 50 on this product. I like it because it hides everything but at the same time it leaves like peeling thingys on your face.</li>
    <li> This was a great product until I found a fabulous BB cream which does so much more than this product ever could.  It&#x27;s lightweight and works well, but I was still on the hunt for the perfect lotion after using it for several months.</li>
    <li> very good protective cream, I would recommend. My skin is very light and need the every day protection. It helps me a lot.</li>
    <li> excellent for sensitive skin. Used this for years.</li>
    <li> Love this sunscreen!  Have been using it for years, whenever I apply makeup.  Helps avoid clumping/flaking of foundation.  I put this sunscreen on over my primer but under my foundation.  Makeup goes on beautifully.</li>
    <li> This is a great tinted moisturizer and sunscreen all in one!  What more could you ask for?  I hope they never discontinue it.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for a friend.  She loves it.</li>
    <li> I have a problem with the produc. is it possible to communicate with you? how? i really appreciate it.</li>
    <li> been using for years and it is great.</li>
    <li> easy to get even on face,love it&lt;br /&gt;for my friends ,they love it&lt;br /&gt;though the delviery is too long time ...</li>
    <li> Clinique city block is pretty much the only sunscreen I can use on a daily basis without breaking out. It&#x27;s pretty light, has a nice tint which hides redness in my skin, and has no odor. I use it 3-5 times a week.</li>
    <li> This is not what I expected. If you have ever used Too Faced&#x27;s eyeshadow primer, that is the exact consistency of this Clinique product, which is super weird for a SPF. It&#x27;s slightly tinted and goes on smoothly, and I haven&#x27;t had any real problems with it, but it&#x27;s just a little weird, and I am not sure I like the consistency. I suggest shopping around before purchasing this stuff.</li>
    <li> Non-oily?  Maybe, but definitely greasy.  I tried this \\&quot;unisex\\&quot; product because a lot of the reviews here and elsewhere claimed it was silky. Personally, I cannot stand something oily or greasy on my face, especially when it is combined with the feeling of wearing a mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it doesn&#x27;t make your face feel that way, good for you!  But if you are specifically looking for something that doesn&#x27;t feel like a greasy mask, be forewarned that it might.  I&#x27;m sure it provides excellent sunblock protection, but Elta MD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46 does too with a lot less feeling of greasiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realize that products like this are not \\&quot;one-size-fits-all\\&quot;, but I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I bought this sunscreen as a way to protect my face since my moisturizer doesn&#x27;t contain sunscreen. I have very oily, sensitive skin and my cheeks are covered with acne rosacea. Finding products that work well with both the sensitive and oily make-up of my skin is hard, but this sunscreen tackles it with ease. I put my moisturizer on, wait several minutes for it to absorb, and then layer this on top. It sinks in quickly, doesn&#x27;t make my skin oilier, which with the heat right now is amazing, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin,and I have yet to get any color on my face. It is pricey, but when I find something that works this well with my skin and that I use every day, the price is worth it</li>
    <li> A tinted lotion with sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin? YES!&lt;br /&gt;And it absorbs into your skin leaving a very natural look.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE it!</li>
    <li> I like this product because it&#x27;s so awesome and it&#x27;s equal at the picture of the wedsite I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Not greasy. Goes on great over moisturizer but under makeup. Has really worked to stop skin damage!</li>
    <li> This product is one of my favorites. It glides on smoothly, protects my face from the sun, and helps my makeup to go on more smoothly. I love it.</li>
    <li> i bought 2 of them, because i have mild skin. it works out fine for me.</li>
    <li> Wonderful sunscreen. This is my second time buying it.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is that it leaves a film on my skin, it doesn&#x27;t blend with the skin. But it has many benefits, and I have sensitive skin and this sunscreen is one of few that I like.</li>
    <li> Bottle lasts for a long time, a little bit goes a long way. Great coverage and can double as a primer. Never clogs my pores or causes breakouts, leaves a nice iridescent glow on my skin. I have sensitive/dry skin and this works great over my moisturizer. Makeup goes on perfectly over it as well.</li>
    <li> I love the fact there is such a high SPF content in this product .&lt;br /&gt;However because of that it makes the product very thick.&lt;br /&gt;Therefore I would tend to use this a bit more religiously in the summer time.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this for light sunscreen protection.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for years mostly to wear during days I spend at home.</li>
    <li> I love that this SPF is 40, giving me the protection I need from the hot Texas sun. It&#x27;s moisturizing but not greasy. If you have very dry skin, I&#x27;d recommend putting it on over a moisturizer because it will accent, rather than smooth over, flaky dry patches. It has just a hint of tint. Definitely not thick enough to be used as foundation, but a little touch of color to even things out if, like me, you&#x27;re not into wearing heavy makeup.</li>
    <li> I am new to any kind of make-up and clueless to some of the related issues as well. So I am a babe when it comes to tints or foundations in speech or practice. That&#x27;s why I want things written out plainly or at least not concealed.&lt;br /&gt;I have always used a moisturizer and as of late tried to use organic products on my face and body when possible being that our skin is our largest organ. Right?&lt;br /&gt;Well anyway my sister has been on me lately about using sun protection year round especially now we&#x27;re getting more mature. Somehow I don&#x27;t like the way that sounds. Okay. Continuing:  So off we go to the cosmetics counter to get some good sunscreen for my face. So I come home with this SCB40. Try it on and it looks like a tinted moisturizer, but leaving my face slightly pasty.  Well I said to myself, why didn&#x27;t the sales associate ask me what tone tint I wanted?  It does blend in and does a fabulous job of evening out my skin tone but I might also like a somewhat darker color so that it might not look so pale.&lt;br /&gt;Let me interrupt myself to say that I really like this product for several reasons. I hate makeup and now with this ?tint? I am sort of wearing makeup and it does seem to give me a glow or polished look. It lasts all day. I usually walk every for exercise and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or eyes, although I do use eye creme closest to my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;However, I had to practically twist arms, not literally to find out is it tinted or not!!  It&#x27;s NOT on the label..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Found out from reading tons of reviews and one knowledgeable sales girl that the tint is to disguise the opaque, chalky look that can come with zinc oxide and titanium oxide which are used in the formulation for sun protection.&lt;br /&gt;If you look online, many will mention the light tint, but when I purchased it the girl did not mention it and when I called back a sales clerk said no tint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe Clinique is probably a good company, as companies go. But why isn&#x27;t this information made clear. First of all, for practicality of use and because well just because!  I like to know what I&#x27;m buying.&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless I am happy with it for now. It just needs to be smoothed in well and allowed to absorb into the skin so the tint doesn&#x27;t look so pasty. It also creates an even skin tone.  Let me be sure to say too that it does its job as a moisturizer; my skin does not feel dry at all with one morning application for every day use.  One thing more since there is a \\&quot;tint\\&quot;, if you use it on your neck and chest be careful to rub it in thoroughly because it can stain clothing.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my dermatologist so I have used it daily for several years. It&#x27;s excellent for skin protection and I always apply it under my moisturizer since it feels a bit dry.</li>
    <li> My wife takes care of your skin from sunlight daily using the Super City Block Ultra Protection SPF 40 and has brought excellent results. She strongly recommended.</li>
    <li> It is more than perfect,it is non oily and it gives a very good texture.</li>
    <li> I love this! Goes on smoothly, and after it dries, I put on my makeup. Even when I am out in the sun all day, I don&#x27;t worry. No sunburn gets through.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m used to the product, it really protect your skin and I like the finish on my skin, it makes that my blush last longer</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff on market, so far as I&#x27;m concerned. I do a fair amount of yard work at our home in northeast Florida. Always have sun glasses on and wear a wide brim straw hat. Though a life long Floridian (grew up in Key West), I never got into that sun worship thing that decades later many people suddenly discover comes home to roost in the worst way. I&#x27;m also 1 of those people who&#x27;ve never been able to tolerate anything on my skin. The very thought of even rolling or spraying underarm deodorant on my armpits has always creeped me out. However, this last year I noticed splotchy reddening on my face. My wife has always sworn by sun block and has been using this tinted Super City Block (SCB) for sometime.  She kept telling me, not using a facial sun block at my age is playing with fire. I was just getting ready to see a dermatologist when I figured I had nothing to lose by trying SCB. In less than 2 weeks the splotchiness disappeared. Can&#x27;t feel it on my face at all. Have been using it ever since, now for about a month. I am sure many other sun blocks out there -- those containing key UV protectants like zinc oxide and titanium dioxide -- are just as good. But until I find 1 as good or better than SCB, I&#x27;m sticking with a proven winner.</li>
    <li> Good product for any women</li>
    <li> This does it all and accommodates my light colored skin just great. Applies smooth and even.</li>
    <li> thanks, my wife loves this item.</li>
    <li> Very good is the block whit the power excellent, my wife like very much this products and similarly of the Clinique</li>
