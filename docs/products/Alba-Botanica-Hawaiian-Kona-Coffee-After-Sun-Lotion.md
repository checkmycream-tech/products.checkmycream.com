      <li>I have very fair skin and am prone to burning in the intense sun here</li>
      <li>Like the way this feels and smells, but I think that aloe and aloe products are more effective after being sun burned.  </li>
      <li>but it is actually very light and not noticeable unless you know what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
      <li>It also smells really nice and felt great on my normally dry/sensitive</li>
      <li>This didn&#x27;t have quite the scent I was going for - I was looking for more of a tropical/coconut smell, whereas this smells like coffee (as-stated).</li>

      <li>I am in love with this lotion.</li>
      <li>It also does make my skin feel better after being in the sun.  </li>

      <li>It smells wonderful and can be used year round.</li>
      <li>It really does help sunburns heal, it&#x27;s my favorite of many after sun lotions</li>
      <li>Although, I wasn&#x27;t sure about the smell at first, it grew on me.  </li>
      <li>I originally bought it because it contains caffeine</li>
      <li>This smells amazing and my favorite to use after I get back from the beach</li>
      <li>look and by the next day my skin is a good tan color.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t care if I had too much sun or not though, this is my go-to every day lotion, I love it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s soothing and helps my fair skin bounce back from sun exposure.</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t super hydrating</li>
      <li>This helped the peeling stopped and will definitely be useful in the summer months</li>
      <li>it is nice, really helps my skin feel soft and hydrated but will stick with the nut oil.</li>
      <li>This products smells ok, I was hoping for a deep rich smell.</li>
      <li>First of all it penetrates deep quickly and probably the reason why it works better than other lotions, it makes your skin feel smooth and actually smells great, very gentle and not overpowering coffee/cocoa smell.</li>
      <li>Amazon has a good price for it too about $6.00 less than at the health food stores.</li>
      <li>I burnt few more times along with my friends who also tried it out and loved it as well after seeing similar results.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m outside in the hot Texas sun most days from sun-up to sun-down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I bought this lotion before going on a week-long vacation on the beach, based on the positive reviews.</li>
      <li>love it and hard to find at such a good price</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m usually pretty good with reapplying sunscreen, but I was expecting it to happen at least 1 day if I wasn&#x27;t being vigilant.</li>
      <li>I applied this after sun exposure (&amp; burning) and I felt it wasn&#x27;t very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like the products I purchased from Alba Botanica</li>
      <li>My whole family uses it.</li>
      <li>Not so much for me-</li>
      <li>I burnt my shoulders during my trip to Mexico so after rinsing all salt water I put this on and had to be gentle since it was hurting to even touch.</li>
      <li>my skin actually needs it) and leaves me soothed and comfortable.</li>
      <li>Felt very soothing on sun burnt skin and prevented peeling.</li>
      <li>It does act and restore much much faster than aloe, aloe can&#x27;t compete and to say true I am not sure aloe ever worked for me, maybe I used cheap stuff before</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll stick with my coconut oil &amp; TJ&#x27;s CBB ~ better products &amp; less money.</li>
      <li>I applied regular sunscreen many times throughout the day (so obviously that did a lot)</li>
      <li>Not only did it calm my irritated skin</li>
      <li>During the same trip after having too much confidence having this lotion around</li>
      <li>This item arrived with a broken lid and loss of contents.. there is still a fair amount of product left</li>
      <li>and it really does help after a little too much time in the sun.</li>
      <li>the hint of coffee is barely there.  </li>
      <li>but I wasn&#x27;t in as much pain as I expected.</li>
      <li>It is so soothing and really does help me heal from those days where I&#x27;m a little too busy to remember to reapply the sunscreen every 90 minutes.</li>
      <li>I MUCH prefer my Trader Joe&#x27;s Coconut Body Butter &amp; just plain old organic coconut oil.</li>
      <li>kinda like a late afternoon breeze on a sweet and earthy coffee plantation in Kona.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> skin was dry and peeling afterlong sun exposure on spring break vacation. This helped the peeling stopped and will definitely be useful in the summer months</li>
    <li> Smells great, very emollient, and absorbs quickly. Great for after a day in the sun in the summer! One of my favorites.</li>
    <li> For sunburns this stuff is amazing!! I went to bed with a mild-medium burn and woke up and it was totally gone! It was a life-saver at the beach...if you missed a spot u can tell it stays red and everything around it is fine!!</li>
    <li> fantastic scent, absorbs well.  its not too heavy either.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice, light after-sun lotion. I worried the coffee smell would be too overpowering but it is actually very light and not noticeable unless you know what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
    <li> I will never use aloe unless burned ever again. Love this product-moisturizes skin great, not greasy-or sticky (the thing I don&#x27;t like about 100% aloe unless burnt).</li>
    <li> It smells, feels, works like a charm! Saw this and am so happy I went and decided to try it. Skip the icky green aloe. Unless you have the aloe plant on your sill and you snip a leave, this is your next best bet if you spend most of the day out like I do.</li>
    <li> This item arrived with a broken lid and loss of contents.. there is still a fair amount of product left but no way can I pack it for the trip it was intended for.</li>
    <li> I used to use aloe but no longer believe that stuff after trying this. I burnt my shoulders during my trip to Mexico so after rinsing all salt water I put this on and had to be gentle since it was hurting to even touch. First of all it penetrates deep quickly and probably the reason why it works better than other lotions, it makes your skin feel smooth and actually smells great, very gentle and not overpowering coffee/cocoa smell. The best part - waking up next morning was priceless - my sunburn was mostly gone! No I was not able to go on the sun next day because it was still burning but I wasn&#x27;t in as much pain as I expected. During the same trip after having too much confidence having this lotion around I burnt few more times along with my friends who also tried it out and loved it as well after seeing similar results.  It does act and restore much much faster than aloe, aloe can&#x27;t compete and to say true I am not sure aloe ever worked for me, maybe I used cheap stuff before but I don&#x27;t know if it made any difference.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great. It&#x27;s a little thicker than I usually like but I can still wear it all over without breaking out. Great for use to ward off mild sunburns.</li>
    <li> LOVE the product! Smells so good and works GREAT on freshly tanned skin! Keeps me glowing!</li>
    <li> This after-sun lotion offers a great scent, goes on smoothly and isn&#x27;t at all greasy or oily.  Very nice after a good shower to lather on and glow</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like the products I purchased from Alba Botanica but I don&#x27;t. This after-sun lotion is not what I was looking for. This products smells ok, I was hoping for a deep rich smell. I MUCH prefer my Trader Joe&#x27;s Coconut Body Butter &amp; just plain old organic coconut oil. I applied this after sun exposure (&amp; burning) and I felt it wasn&#x27;t very moisturizing. One evening after showering I applied to my arms &amp; shoulders before going out to dinner &amp; later that night I noticed that my arms looked dry &amp; ashy looking!! I&#x27;ll stick with my coconut oil &amp; TJ&#x27;s CBB ~ better products &amp; less money. Again, I&#x27;m very disappointed! I really wanted to love this product.  :(</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion before going on a week-long vacation on the beach, based on the positive reviews. It worked wonders and I am convinced this is what saved me from sunburn! I applied regular sunscreen many times throughout the day (so obviously that did a lot) but so did my family members, and many of them ended up with bad sunburns. I&#x27;m usually pretty good with reapplying sunscreen, but I was expecting it to happen at least 1 day if I wasn&#x27;t being vigilant. Nope, never experienced the red, hot, painful skin! It also smells really nice and felt great on my normally dry/sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thinking this will be a go-to lotion for me in the summer!</li>
    <li> I use Alba Botanica Coconut Milk Body Cream, 6.5-Ounce for daily moisture and that does a great job after the sun on it&#x27;s own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is similar, but amped up a bit with the coffee. This applies well and definitely calms down the red  &amp;#34;oh crap I&#x27;m almost burned and might peel&amp;#34; look and by the next day my skin is a good tan color. Win.</li>
    <li> This smells amazing and my favorite to use after I get back from the beach</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff we have found for sunburn...much better than aloe.  My red-haired son got horribly burned in California one year to the point of swelling and blistering and this product was the only product that relieved the pain.  Somehow it also heals the burn faster too.  Amazon has a good price for it too about $6.00 less than at the health food stores.</li>
    <li> It might be coincidence, but I swear my tan lasted longer with this lotion. It smells great. It is a thick lotion, but I wanted that for my dry skin. It didn&#x27;t seem greasy.</li>
    <li> Smells great and does what it says.  Took it to the beach with me, and after a long day in the sun, I would put this on every evening, good stuff!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> The smell of this is what dreams are made of. I am in love with this lotion. Thank you for making this.</li>
    <li> love it and hard to find at such a good price</li>
    <li> truly relieves sunburn... quickly and routinely and it  smells awesome, lasts long and is affordable</li>
    <li> This stuff is genius! My whole family uses it. This is a great product for healing sunburn or just after sun use. It works better than aloe!</li>
    <li> A friend of mine introduced me to this after-sun lotion after a trip to the beach. Not only did it calm my irritated skin but it smells AMAZING! I now use the lotion everyday; smells like a trip to Hawaii.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t have quite the scent I was going for - I was looking for more of a tropical/coconut smell, whereas this smells like coffee (as-stated).</li>
    <li> Great smell and texture. Felt very soothing on sun burnt skin and prevented peeling. Just what I needed!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I started using it years ago after picking it up at my local grocery but had to look to Amazon after that store stopped carrying it this year. I have very fair skin and am prone to burning in the intense sun here if I spend any time outside. I don&#x27;t know if this does anything for the long term sun damage but in the short term it keeps my skin from peeling as severely with a bad burn as it would otherwise.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite lotions. It&#x27;s perfect for after sun care. It smells wonderful and can be used year round.</li>
    <li> I bought this as an alternative to aloe before I went on a Caribbean vacation. I got sun burnt the second day and I had a terrible time getting the lotion out of the container. Which was frustrating when I was already uncomfortable. The product was nice and soothing but wasn&#x27;t a miracle.</li>
    <li> This productuct is best in preventing sunburns.  It smells good and you can feel it healing your  skin.  The best!</li>
    <li> The best hydrating oil ever!!! Lovely light scent.  Great in the bath as well as a skin lotion/</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a dude. I work in the oilfield. I&#x27;m outside in the hot Texas sun most days from sun-up to sun-down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife actually got it for me(I wouldn&#x27;t have even thought crap like this existed), and I must admit: this stuff WORKS. I never knew my skin needed this. It is so soothing and really does help me heal from those days where I&#x27;m a little too busy to remember to reapply the sunscreen every 90 minutes. In years past after a shower I&#x27;d just slather that nasty aloe gel that gets dried/sticky/crusty. Not anymore. This is my after shower go to. It absorbs quickly(because my skin actually needs it) and leaves me soothed and comfortable. The scent is very nice...my wife loves it on me. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a manly smell or a feminine smell...kinda like a late afternoon breeze on a sweet and earthy coffee plantation in Kona. And the best part is when I fall asleep I dream of Hawaii every night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish they had this stuff in bulk. Because I&#x27;d buy it in gallon pump jugs if I could.</li>
    <li> Smells awesome and helps me keep my tan longer.</li>
    <li> Not really fond of smell.</li>
    <li> This is the best after sun lotion I have ever used. I used to buy it in the store but they stopped carrying it. I would have a horrible sun burn and cake this stuff on it and massage it in only to wake up the next day with glowing tan skin. This stuff is magic! Definitely purchasing again! And again!</li>
    <li> caps off product all over white bag on all</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  Although, I wasn&#x27;t sure about the smell at first, it grew on me.  I originally bought it because it contains caffeine and that&#x27;s suppose to firm your skin (temporarily).  It&#x27;s nothing dramatic, but I think it works.  It also does make my skin feel better after being in the sun.  I wouldn&#x27;t put it on if I had a sun burn, but just for the dryness that comes from getting some rays.</li>
    <li> Heavy on natural ingredients, but does contain cetyl alchohol and dimethicone.  Does not have a strong scent - the hint of coffee is barely there.  Soaks into skin nicely.</li>
    <li> Like the way this feels and smells, but I think that aloe and aloe products are more effective after being sun burned.  I know this is an after-sun lotion, so it should just be extending your tan, but after getting severely burned I had hoped that it would sooth some of the burn as well.  It makes the burn burn more if it is massaged into burned skin!  Buy it as a tan extender and a lotion, not when you think  you will get burned (this was my problem with it).</li>
    <li> This is my goto after sun lotion. It&#x27;s soothing and helps my fair skin bounce back from sun exposure. It can sting a bit on really burnt skin, but no more so than other lotions I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s more of a tingling sting than a painful one.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews of heavenly scent I ordered. I am already a fan of the kukui nut oil and thought this might be just as fab. Not so much for me- it is nice, really helps my skin feel soft and hydrated but will stick with the nut oil. Also kinda hard to squeeze out of the bottle.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after the Coppertone after sun caused irritation on my son&#x27;s skin.  This works great and we both love the smell.</li>
    <li> I used this every night on a recent vacation and it seemed to do very little in the way of an after sun lotion.  It wasn&#x27;t super hydrating and it didn&#x27;t help at all with slight sun burns.  It also doesn&#x27;t smell very appealing either.</li>
    <li> It smells great, it goes on well (not too greasy and not too watery), makes my skin soft, it smells delicious! and it really does help after a little too much time in the sun. I don&#x27;t care if I had too much sun or not though, this is my go-to every day lotion, I love it. Did I mention it smells yummy? Yes, it has a wonderful scent that I love, but it&#x27;s not too strong</li>
    <li> Love this lotion, very rich and moisturizing. It really does help sunburns heal, it&#x27;s my favorite of many after sun lotions</li>
    <li> Not loving this. I have used this product before and the smell was heavenly--like coffee. I have used it once and found it smells as if it has gone bad or is past it&#x27;s freshness date. I won&#x27;t be using it.</li>
