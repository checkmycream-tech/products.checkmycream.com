<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I tried a sample pack of this when going to my usual stand-up tanning bed...I usually use another brand with 50x bronzers, so I thought the 100x bronzer would be better...and oh my goodness is it. I was AMAZED at how dark I got after just one use. I&#x27;d say after I had already established my base tan, and then used this a good 3 or 4 times, I was a bronzed goddess! This can be used indoors or out, it&#x27;s highly recommended by myself, a regular tanner. One caution, it will turn your hands orange if you do not wash them immediately after application. Helpful Hint: Put it on before you go tan, wash your hands at home, then drive to tanning salon. It will have a longer time to absorb and be more effective! Be prepared to be DARK BROWN! You&#x27;ll love it! Guys and gals!</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time, and after one use my skin felt silky, it smelled nice and I could tell from one use I was a little darker.  I&#x27;m crazy about Ed Hardy products, so finding this at an affordable price was amazing.</li>
    <li> This stuff works as advertised, I can assure you.  Excellent indoor tanning product and can be used outside as well.</li>
    <li> I liked this one, it gave me a nice brown color and not that orage look, I really liked it but it doesn&#x27;t beat the one I love that really works fast,&amp;#34;anything goes &amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Worked great and smelled good too! Great color!</li>
    <li> LOVE IT... I&#x27;m a redhead...I have to use *good* products or I turn orange or it doesn&#x27;t match some how... this stuff is the bomb. Love it.. and my new tattoo looks great with this... love how the L-Tyrosine is in the lotion. others need to follow your lead. will buy again :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m returning this! I received this lotion earlier in the week, and was excited to try this. Can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m happy with the results I broke out into what looked like a rash, and it turned me orange. I&#x27;m very aware of how well lotions need to be rubbed in and washing your hands after application but this stuff isn&#x27;t great. The smell was amazing and there was no ATO which i loved but i still wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product get a better product.</li>
    <li> This stuff will turn you orange. Or it did with me and I&#x27;ve had my base tan all ready too. I only gave it 2 stars for the AMAZING smell. But if you want to look like a oompa loompa then this is for you.</li>
    <li> Another Fine Product from Ed Hardy. I switch lotions when I tan. If you want great color Don&#x27;t always use the same lotion. This Smells Amazing. Get great results . Make sure to wash hands after applying.</li>
    <li> Just what I expected. Very nice.</li>
    <li> Left me too sticky and washed completely off after first shower</li>
    <li> The best lotion I&#x27;ve had so far. As an employee at a tanning salon, I&#x27;ve had the chance to try many lotions and this one exceeds my expectations. Great color difference in a week, smells good, and my tan lasts longer so I don&#x27;t need to tan as often as before. This is my absolute fave!</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite tanning lotion for dark results! I use this lotion regularly in the tanning bed. This lotion is a goes on dark, does not streak and has a nice fragrance! I have achieved dark results from using this lotion! I tan regularly indoors at least 3-4 times a week. Highly recommend this product if you want a dark tan!</li>
    <li> I love this product, along with my end hardy body shots!! I switch off every other tan!!</li>
    <li> Love love love this lotion. Ed Hardy never fails... Only slight problem if you don&#x27;t wash your hands after you get out your hands will be a little orange but no Orange tint other then on my hands. It gets you dark fast and it smells really good!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! Wasn&#x27;t open or broken in the packaging. Made me really tan in just a couple weeks an like the smell came in the mail pretty fast as well.</li>
    <li> It gives pretty decent color if you are pale and need a quick boost. I always use this when I&#x27;m starting a new tanning season to give me a base tan so I can move on to tingle lotions</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a busy middle aged woman and don&#x27;t have a lot of extra cash for tanning beds or extra time to go tanning 3-4 times per week.  I DO however have a great spot in my backyard to lay out for an hour on a lazy Sunday, but wanted a little extra help for my super white skin to speed up the tanning process.  I&#x27;ve used fake tanner before and they work ok, don&#x27;t usually get a super deep tan though and fade pretty fast.  But THIS STUFF - it&#x27;s actually working pretty well considering my limited once-per-week tanning opportunity.  I really don&#x27;t know what all those ingredients do, and I can smell the familiar fake-tan lotion smell, but I&#x27;m hoping that the other ingredients will actually help to stimulate my stubborn melanin to get a decent tan that lasts if I miss laying out for a week or two.  Anyway, for what it&#x27;s worth, this stuff seems to work well for laying out in the sun on this white girl...</li>
    <li> by far one of the best lotions I&#x27;ve ever used, possibley THE best. Always a huge color boost that lasts a good bit and looks great, not orange. be sure to clean your palms after application though!</li>
    <li> Great product, my wife loves to tan and this really is a great product and helped her get very tan very quick.</li>
    <li> Worned wonders for my wife. Great product. No seemingly harsh chemicals or odors. Would recommend to a friend. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> I like that the smell is good, it gives you a dark tan right away. A great product i would highly recommend.  I would suggest washing your hands right away though, as the bronzer will turn your hands orange.</li>
    <li> If you want color this is the bottle for you..when I use this product I feel like I have a spray Tan..its the best!!! And I Always order all my Tanning products through you guy&#x27;s..can never find any Tanning Products cheaper then you guy&#x27;s. .Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> Was not expecting this to ship so quickly and was very pleased with the product! It has kept my tattoo in great shape and I love that it doesn&#x27;t leave an &amp;#34;after-tan&amp;#34; strong smell to my body.</li>
    <li> I tan like 3-4 times a week and sometimes i wont tan for a week and the colored stays!! It smells super awesome, totally help my tattoos not fade and my tan was natural looking-not orangy.  I get compliments on my skin all the time!! I also have acne prone skin and i use this lotion on my face and it acutally helps my breakouts! ya the tanning itself may have something to do with it but this lotion does not clog my pores or make my face oily after tanning!! I am so happy i purchased this!!</li>
    <li> Good but not my favorite.</li>
    <li> Great bronzing lotion! Noticeable results almost immediately</li>
    <li> It is exactly as listed. It is a great deep and dark tanning lotion. Most definitely the best that I have tried.</li>
    <li> I told the girl at my tanning salon that I needed whatever would get me darkest the quickest. She grabbed a packet of Black Ink and said it is very popular and she sees the difference when ladies come out after using it. I LOVE tanning lotions, I literally have dozens of bottles everything from Designer Skin to JWoww. I have used Ed Hardy products before so I was pleased with the recommendation and was anxious to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I did mix it with Bombshell and the scent of the Bombshell over powered the smell of the Blank Ink. I smelled it when I squeezed it out of the packet and really enjoyed the scent but what impressed me the most was when I exited the bed and looked in the mirror instead of seeing the angry red (from the tingler in Bombshell) I saw a nice, dark tan! I&#x27;m about 7 hours and a shower post tanning and I still have a deep tan!&lt;br /&gt;I will be purchasing a full bottle and add it to the rotation of my lotions!&lt;br /&gt;(I do, however, HIGHLY recommend having baby wipes in your tanning bed if a sink is not accessible; my tanning girl told me it would stain my hands and between my fingers and as dark as I got with just one application I see where that could happen!)</li>
    <li> I bought it because of all of the positive feedback but I don&#x27;t think it is any better than any other lotion that I&#x27;ve used.  Also the top broke after I used it once.  Kind of annoying.</li>
    <li> Best lotion I have found and I go to the tanning bed 3 to 4 times a week and this lotion is not to greasy and has a great smell and this is my third bottle from amazon and all 3 have been great.</li>
    <li> I love this product!! I was buying the sample packets every week, because I couldn&#x27;t afford the whole bottle, so I found it on here and am so happy with it!! I have used other products, but this one makes me look like a bronzed goddess everytime!! I can&#x27;t wait to use it over and over again and next time I won&#x27;t wait so long to look for it on here!</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> First of all this product smells absolutely amazing!!!!! My mother in law bought this for herself and when I ran out of my lotion she told me I could try hers out. So I did and I used it twice. First time I loved it! There wasn&#x27;t a bad after tan smell but I did smell lightly &amp;#34;roasted&amp;#34; and I noticed a little beach bum golden color added but as the time went on after I tanned I watched it fade and make a little LESS darker than I already was.. the second time I used it there wasn&#x27;t really any immediate after color change and the next morning when I woke up I appeared to lightening in color AGAIN!! So I have switched to my back up lotion for use until my new lotion arrives. I&#x27;m going to try Black Elixir and if I notice I&#x27;m fading color again I&#x27;ll just switch back to Darksyde Wicked Black that got me totally tan within 2 weeks of use! The only thing besides the smell that I really loved about this lotion is that my skin felt so much firmer! I&#x27;m not sure if this lotion has the BodyFit formula with it or not but if it does it&#x27;s truly amazing</li>
    <li> I use this lotion almost every day, I use a tanning bed once or twice by using this lotion I stay dark. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad nor does it come off on you clothes. I&#x27;ve ordered several bottles this season</li>
    <li> Love this lotion ! I am naturally tan but like to keep a little more of my summer glow all throughout winter. I&#x27;ll use this lotion in a level one tanning bed four times and have a gorgeous summer glow ! It does give a little bit of that after than smell but not much. But also has an amIng smell to it at the same time ! I started using this at a salon for over $80 I am so happy to have found it for cheaper online and will be buying another bottle once this one runs out !</li>
    <li> I just got this in today and immediately after went and tanned. I noticed a significant difference in one use compared to my other snooki lotion. This lotion has a lot of bronzer and smells amazing! I will be ordering a second bottle soon. :)</li>
    <li> This product works and smells great! I got great results after just one use and you dont feel grimy after. The smell is amazing and doesn&#x27;t stink after you tan, unlike other tanning lotions.</li>
    <li> The lotion is okay, it gets you dark real fast, but I broke out into hives and my body itched like crazy. So I have a whole bottle that I can not use.</li>
    <li> Loved it . Colors great and doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.! The smell is great and i could see a difference after one use and i already have a pretty good tan. Only downfall is after a few hours the dha smell or after tan odor is pretty strong.</li>
    <li> I bought it for the smell can&#x27;t say I overly impressed.  Way over priced for what it is. I don&#x27;t have tat&#x27;s so can&#x27;t comment on  how  well that part works.  I prefer a silicone based lotion any day!</li>
    <li> Great product, works perfect!</li>
    <li> Great price &amp; results!! Highly suggest to anyone who wants the perfect tan quickly..  Works with the first use, very noticeable results.</li>
    <li> I bought this item because I was going to start tanning. However I have been so busy I have not tried it yet. Just like picture and description described though.</li>
    <li> I go a new tattoo when I had just started tanning and was so worried that it would fade so I tried this product and it works great there is no fading and my tat looks great</li>
    <li> I have been tanning for several years and have tried just about every lotion with high reviews. This is the first time I have every felt compelled to give my own review on a product. It&#x27;s fantastic. You notice a difference right away. I have not had any problems with streaking. It&#x27;s one of the few lotions I have tried that you don&#x27;t feel like you have to run to the shower right after tanning. There is no sticky or gummy feeling and no strong after tanning smell. I still have over half a bottle left but placed a reorder just so I don&#x27;t run out. I highly recommend Black Ink. I&#x27;m very fair complected and burn easily - this has given me a terrific tan.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;You get the prettiest bronze color just after a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy this again!</li>
    <li> I love love love this tanning lotion. I feel like it got me darker than others! Great for tattoos too! Amazing scent. Defientely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Great product works great. Only reason for the three stars is for the staining of my hands.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to use the lotion yet, since I&#x27;m waiting for a tattoo to heal. But, I received the lotion the next day and the more people I talk to about it, the more good things I hear! I can&#x27;t wait to get started!</li>
    <li> Love it best stuff out there wouldn&#x27;t use anything else makes me dark fast without a lot of tan time</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t turn your skin a weird color and it really helps your tattoos not fade</li>
    <li> Smells fantastic and definitely will get you darker in just one session as promised. I bought this lotion for my boyfriend, he loves it. This lotion does what it says it will do and it&#x27;s definitely worth buying tanning lotions online. At least 70% cheaper than salons and a much bigger selection. I would recommend this lotion to anyone who has a good base tan and wants to get dark quickly.</li>
    <li> I love Ed Hardy lotion however for a darker tan get Black Elixir which i will be going back to.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a four days and I seem to be getting darker with it and it smells so GOOD!!&#x27;</li>
    <li> Right after one session you will look at least 3 shades darker and it lasts!!! I also love the smell</li>
    <li> I am a natural redhead with pale skin and this gave me a nice natural looking tan without any orange shade or streaking plus it smells good. I highly reccomend</li>
    <li> The product came to me fast in the mail. The lid was broken when arrived. I went to wal-mart bought some 3oz squeeze bottles and transferred the product. The product goes on good. Smells good going on and u can still smell afterwards. The only thing I noticed is that u can smell burnt skin afterwards and until u take a shower. Not sure why it heightenes it. I go in the tanning bed w/o lotion and I don&#x27;t smell burnt skin smell. The product does darken the skin though. It could just be my skin mixed with the lotion. I have been an avid Tanner for years. I started when 16 and now 44. I am always testing and trying new products. I say give it a try yourself you might love it!</li>
    <li> love all ed hardy tanning bed lotions...but this one is by far my favorite...also having old and new tatoos it really helps hold the color and it does work right away in the tanning bed! i have been using life of the party but i think this one is much better...get darker results and doesnt wash off in the shower...very happy with this lotion:)</li>
    <li> I had been tanning for weeks before I tried this lotion, to get tan for my wedding, and after purchasing Black Ink I only went 5 more times and I had a beautiful tan</li>
    <li> it gives me a good color, the smell before tanning isn&#x27;t too bad or too fragrancy, but i don&#x27;t love how i smell after tanning, and i feel like it stays with me for a long time, even after showering. the cap is really annoying as well, its two pieces for some reason and it falls apart all the time.</li>
    <li> Although this tanning lotion did keep my skin soft and delivered a very quick deep tan it acre more like a spray on tan and after the first week of tanning I noticed my deep tan started to rub off after showers and exercise and my normal skin ton was the same as it was before I started tanning</li>
    <li> Im not satisfied with product. Hav used it over a month and not impressed with results. I hav had a base tan and usually get darker whn I tan every day for a month with other products. I wil not be ordering this one again.</li>
    <li> good lotion--have bought again</li>
    <li> This product does get you tan fast but I have noticed that after I take a shower its like i wash my color off. I have naturally tan skin anyways so for color not to stick is beyond me. I think it might have to much bronzer in it which also leaves me looking a little orange. I&#x27;m going to look for something without so much bronzer and maybe use this every once in a while. Also it tends to streak and give you orange hands.</li>
    <li> I was excited when I received this item, but very quickly was disappointed. Upon opening the bottle I found the color to have a green tint to it. Also the fragrance was wrong. I was to scared to even try it due to the color. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> First time I used it I sat in the tanning bed for 8 minutes and I was significantly darker on the first use. Definitely recommend it for anyone wanting to get dark and to protect what ink they have invested it. Mine still look vibrant as the day I got them!</li>
    <li> The lotion is expired. When I put it on it curdles and makes me all red.</li>
    <li> This lotion does the job. It gets you dark fast and smells really good. Just be sure to wipe your hands after you apply it or you will have tan palms.</li>
    <li> I was tired of spending money on single packets so I decided to get this n now il be saving some cash</li>
    <li> Streaks and turn my palms orange. It&#x27;s not worth paying what it costs even though it does give you a great tan color. Is not worth the streaks though.</li>
    <li> product was delievered 3 days after ordered.  Isampled this product for a week at the tanning salon i use &amp; was so pleased with it that I purchased it from here for much cheaper than what salons are asking for it.  Defintely recommend it.</li>
    <li> This works as well as everyone says it would. I have gotten really dark with it and will definitely buy more!</li>
