      <li>I honesly love this flat iron it works great</li>
      <li>I was less than impressed.</li>
      <li>control, and the quick shiny results we get with this iron!</li>
      <li>This iron is so amazing that I honestly will never use anything else again, and if the one I have now ever breaks for any reason, I will definitely repurchase.  </li>
      <li>it leaves it shiny and smooth for two days.</li>
      <li>It also doesn&#x27;t leave my hair staticky or flying everywhere and it feels smooth.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t glide smoothly over the hair like my chi.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used MANY different kinds of straighteners and this is by far the best.</li>
      <li>Great flat iron, I&#x27;ve read a lot of comments that said that their is a recall in this iron, that&#x27;s the reason why they are so cheap....</li>
      <li>Heats up fast!!!</li>
      <li>hot fast, came in great condition, and shipping was right on time with the quote</li>
      <li>worth the price!</li>
      <li>The replacement iron is even more messed up than the first one.</li>
      <li>Worth the price!</li>
      <li>The only caveat I would give is that I think the 1\\&quot; is good for hair up to shoulder length.</li>
      <li>She loved it until last week when the ceramic plates fell off.</li>
      <li>(Imagine if you tried to push your teeth together if your jaw and bottom teeth weren&#x27;t straight with your top teeth.)</li>
      <li>the price at amazon is another good thing about this flat iron.</li>
      <li>Upon receiving the product, I quickly knew I had made a mistake.</li>
      <li>Leaves hair shiny, heats up quickly, doesn&#x27;t snag hair....</li>
      <li>I bought this one to replace an older version that broke after many years of use.</li>
      <li>The Cortex Flat Iron has held up very well and was a great price.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Thank you very much!</li>
      <li>My wife purchased this Flat Iron well over a year ago and it has been working perfectly that entire time.  </li>
      <li>so i had to get a new one because i fell in love with it.</li>
      <li>but in the case of this iron, that&#x27;s exactly what it means!</li>
      <li>I am very pleased I decided on this flat iron, I would recommend it to anyone!   </li>
      <li>The Outlet Center is a great company and they really care about the customer&#x27;s satisfaction.</li>
      <li>Also, this straightener is WELL worth the money.</li>
      <li>I just threw away my old one :)</li>
      <li>/&gt;Perhaps I haven&#x27;t use it enough to give it  a honest review.</li>
      <li>A quality heat protectant like Bed Head Guardian Angel runs you about $5 and is every bit worth it.   </li>
      <li>After using it she was just gushing about how good it worked and how her hair felt so soft and smooth, and that her FHI left her hair feeling \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>The only problem with this straightener is that the plastic feels cheap and could be better quality.</li>
      <li>I recieved my Cortex flat iron yesterday and used it after washing and drying my hair and my hair looked nice.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Save $30 or so...i got mine in Marshall&#x27;s for 29.99 and i&#x27;ve seen it in TJ Maxx for the same price as Marshall&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> My daughter got this as a gift.  She wanted a Chi but they were so expensive that we decided to try this one since it had different temperature settings.  It works great.  The first two that were shipped to us were damaged in transit somehow and the company quickly sent a new one each time and also paid returned shipping.  This company has great customer service!  We will buy again.</li>
    <li> Despite some bad reviews, I purchased the Cortex Platinum. It doesn&#x27;t sing and dance but it does a great job of getting the job done, not scorching my hair and leaves it nice and shiny. Had I paid full price, I&#x27;d be disappointed but for right around half it was a good deal.</li>
    <li> I purchased this, already having another brand and it does work well. The only thing I kinda don&#x27;t like about it is it tends to pull the hair when I get to the end. But it was shipped promptly and does work great.</li>
    <li> I bought my Cortex flat iron at a mall kiosk over 2 years ago. What I love most about this iron is that it does not give me the burnt hair smell and it leaves my hair shiny without any additives. My scalp is very sensitive and I usually do not put anything in my hair because it will make my scalp itch all day. With this iron I did not need to add anything and my hair would look great for days.    Another thing I like about the iron is that its tempature is adjustable up to 450 degrees and it takes only a minute to get hot. No more waiting for the iron to heat up.    My sisters and girlfriends love how my hair looks after I use the flat iron on it and they are always asking to borrow it that sometimes I cannot remember who borrowed it last. When I bought mine over two years ago at the mall I paid $99.99 and the MSRP is $225. I was able to find them on amazon for $26.50; so this year I gave all my sisters and girlfriends one for Christmas. Everyone was ecstatic over their gift.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is better for those with short or thin hair, or maybe if you just want to use it on your bangs. I have very long thick hair,and while I didn&#x27;t expect it to work without sectioning my hair I was less than impressed. One of the major things I do not like about this iron is the fact that it does not have a locking option to keep the plates together when not in use. I also do not like the manual spinning temperature gauge. I would not buy this again, and I am glad I only paid less than 30 dollars. Save your money, there are much better irons out there (Remington T-Studio Pearl Essence) for that price.</li>
    <li> March 6:  Save your money, ladies! I should have known better after seeing all of the reviews across the web talking about how they got theirs in Marshalls or at Ross. THE MODELS SOLD IN TJ MAXX, MARSHALLS AND OTHER DISCOUNT STORES ARE KNOWN TO HAVE MANUFACTURING IRREGULARITIES. Most brand name or high-end items sold in those discount stores are there FOR A REASON. Very little of it is actually \\&quot;overstock\\&quot; or \\&quot;end of season\\&quot;. Usually, the items didn&#x27;t pass quality control for retail sale. That doesn&#x27;t always mean it&#x27;s outright defective...but in the case of this iron, that&#x27;s exactly what it means! Read around the web a little bit and you&#x27;ll see people mention problems that are OUT OF THE BOX defects. What&#x27;s worse? The \\&quot;limited lifetime warranty\\&quot; is totally void unless you buy it from the manufacturer. Even if you DO buy it from them, they want $24 to ship it in for \\&quot;repair\\&quot;...even though it&#x27;s DEFECTIVE. Considering I paid $34 for it, it&#x27;s not worth $24 for \\&quot;repair\\&quot;, I&#x27;ve wasted my money and time.    I saw another person&#x27;s review where she said her iron came with the plates slightly crooked and it snagged her hair. Well, same here. The \\&quot;arms\\&quot; don&#x27;t close properly, they don&#x27;t align. (Imagine if you tried to push your teeth together if your jaw and bottom teeth weren&#x27;t straight with your top teeth.) So while most good irons are supposed to have a minuscule amount of space between the plates when you close them, the plates on mine actually touch all the way (no space in between) on the very tip...and it rips out several strands of hair on EVERY PASS. Maybe this wouldn&#x27;t be a big deal for certain hair types...oily hair or hair with glossy chemicals. I&#x27;m your typical white girl of Swedish descent with average-thickness hair, that is 80% straight. I&#x27;ve owned an FHI, a Chi, and a TIGI Bedhead iron. I&#x27;m not a newbie. My hair shouldn&#x27;t be getting ripped out every time I run the iron through. Speaking of...I wasn&#x27;t really impressed with the heat on this iron. Despite having straight white girl hair, I still had to turn it up to 400 and I still had to run it through the same strands multiple times. It might have something to do with the crooked plates, but does it even matter at this point? The thing is unusable, don&#x27;t get RIPPED OFF like me!    March 7: Update -- Amazon allowed me to exchange the iron, the replacement is arriving today. I&#x27;ll update the review after trying it out a few times this week.    March 13:   DO NOT BUY!!!!! The replacement iron is even more messed up than the first one. The ceramic plates weren&#x27;t bent as much, no, instead ONE HAS A CHIP! Not only that, but it doesn&#x27;t close straight either. And it doesn&#x27;t seem to keep heat the way the first one did. THEY BOTH RIP MY HAIR OUT ON EVERY PASS. These were just poorly designed for non-African hair. Which is ridiculous, a good flat iron works on anybody&#x27;s hair. I&#x27;m getting my money back, it was a mistake to think I could get a REALLY good quality flat iron for less than $90.</li>
    <li> I really was nervous about purchasing this item because of some reviews I had read.  I really am happy that I went ahead and got it.  It has been wonderful.  I have shown it to my hair dresser and she was impressed with it.  GREAT ITEM!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a Cortex 1\\&quot; platinum for about 2 years now. I have no complaints with its performance, and my hair is very healthy. No split ends and growing well. I only use it once a week to straighten after air-drying, and only turn the temperature up to halfway (approx 275 degrees). NEVER EVER EVER buy a flat iron without a temperature control, no matter which brand you buy. Irons without a temperature control heat to about 400-450 degrees!!! It&#x27;s impossible to have healthy hair when you burn it at temperatures hotter than you cook meat. I recently went on a girls&#x27; vacation, and one of my friends who forgot her FHI at home asked to use my Cortex. After using it she was just gushing about how good it worked and how her hair felt so soft and smooth, and that her FHI left her hair feeling \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot;. As soon as we got back home she ordered a Cortex for herself!    The only caveat I would give is that I think the 1\\&quot; is good for hair up to shoulder length. If your hair is longer, you may want a wider plate, depending on your personal preference. I am considering getting a 1-3/4\\&quot; or 2\\&quot;, and while I&#x27;m tempted to try something new like a Solia or Sedu, I really don&#x27;t feel like gambling that much money on a flat iron that may not perform as good as this one, so I am pretty sure I will end up getting a 2\\&quot; Cortex.    Oh and I almost forgot! The red light on the unit goes OFF when it is not actively heating up (i.e., it reaches the set temperature). The red light is only ON while it is initially heating up, or when it cools off a bit and needs to re-heat to get back to the set temperature. At first I thought it was broken, because I was used to irons where the light always stays on, but that is not the case with this one.</li>
    <li> I ignored the negative reviews for this item since they were mixed. Upon receiving the product, I quickly knew I had made a mistake. The product was very poorly made, did not heat to the desired temperature, and did not stay hot after using it on 2 sections of hair. Do not waste your money on this piece of junk!!</li>
    <li> I got my first cortex flat Iron a year ago, but sadly it broke after three falls. the ceramic plates do not resist much. so i had to get a new one because i fell in love with it. I have long frizzy hair and this flat iron makes miracles with my hair. it leaves it shiny and smooth for two days. its perfect for curling hair too. I honesly love this flat iron it works great and i like the fact that everybody makes good complements about how healthy and shiny my hair looks. the price at amazon is another good thing about this flat iron. I&#x27;m so happy that i got my cortex and this time I would take care of it.[[ASIN:B002LE8PBY Cortex Platinum Flat Iron, Black]]</li>
    <li> Fantastic flat iron. My hair has never been so silky and soft after ironing!! I just threw away my old one :) The Outlet Center is a great company and they really care about the customer&#x27;s satisfaction. I got an email right away from them, thanking and offering any support. That was very personal and I really appreciated. Can&#x27;t complain at all about this experience!!!! Thank you Amanda :)</li>
    <li> This product is just ok. Like that it heats up to 450F, but I didn&#x27;t see a good shine and my hair felt fried after. I know you&#x27;re thinking what do you expect for putting the temp that high?? but the ISO product is much better in my opinion and I&#x27;m able to get a glossy healthy look afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps I haven&#x27;t use it enough to give it  a honest review. I plan to use this just as a backup. I quickly purchased the ISO and I&#x27;m really happy with it so I will stick to it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item for my daughter for christmas but she needed it so i gave it to her and she absolutely loves it. Works great on her thick hair. Really great product! I would recommend to all my friends and family.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron, I&#x27;ve read a lot of comments that said that their is a recall in this iron, that&#x27;s the reason why they are so cheap....I saw this iron in a well know store for the price $75....I guest they have the unrecall items...People getting right their is nothing wrong with product</li>
    <li> I think this product is a fake or defect. It fried my hair...even on a low setting. My friend has a real one and it is wonderful. I should have known by the price that it was too good to be true. Save your money and buy a real one from the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> Very good flat iron.  It is really easy to use and the finish is great.  (I&#x27;m so glad for the sale.)</li>
    <li> We love the cortex flat iron at our house. This purchase is our 5th. We have broken two by dropping them on a hard surface, which is the only drawback to the ceramic flat iron. If you are careful with it it will last a very long time. We like the temp. control, and the quick shiny results we get with this iron!</li>
    <li> When my Hot Tools straightener broke (my fault, not the product&#x27;s), I had to wheel down to my local Walmart to get a replacement fast. I got a product that shall not be named because it was so useless. I knew that I needed to replace it with something GOOD and I needed to do it fast so I jumped on Amazon to get a duplicate of the straightener I had. Well, after reading the reviews I chose to get the Cortex flat iron instead. Good choice on my part. I LOVE it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I heats up quickly, it&#x27;s got a temperature dial in case I ever need it at less than full heat (not likely with my hair), and it leaves my hair super shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no negatives to report on this product. It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Perfect for tick hair! I can make my hair style very easy and quickly.. This is the first time that my hair style last longer after using this flat iron.. Very satisfied!!!</li>
    <li> I recieved my Cortex flat iron yesterday and used it after washing and drying my hair and my hair looked nice.  It wasn&#x27;t frizzy and it shined.  Make sure to spray something on your hair before straightening your hair so that it doesn&#x27;t burn.  I am an African American with shoulder length ,relaxed hair.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a flat iron but not wanting to spend 100$ or more on a CHI.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased I decided on this flat iron, I would recommend it to anyone!   Def. worth the price!</li>
    <li> I have really thick and long hair so it takes me over an hour to straighten my hair, and even then it&#x27;s not perfectly straight. This straightener has a temperature control and it has a higher heat setting for people who have hair like mine. It works really great and I can straighten my hair in about 5 mins! I&#x27;ve used MANY different kinds of straighteners and this is by far the best. It also doesn&#x27;t leave my hair staticky or flying everywhere and it feels smooth. The only problem with this straightener is that the plastic feels cheap and could be better quality. Also, this straightener is WELL worth the money. I definitely recommend it for everyone who has been struggling to find a straightener for long and thick hair. There&#x27;s also a 25 year warranty with my straightener.    EDIT: I&#x27;m STILL using this straightener that I have now had for 3 years. It still works great and have not had any problems with it since.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is terrific! My hair is pin straight and my hair completely stays styled all day long when using this flat iron!  Worth the price!</li>
    <li> Flat iron stopped working in less than four months! Worked okay while it worked, but not like it should have. Not worth the money...</li>
    <li> I think the people that gave this flat iron a good review have never used a real tourmaline ceramic flat iron, i.e. Chi or sedu. This iron was terrible. It was rough and snagged my hair as I pulled. It didn&#x27;t glide smoothly over the hair like my chi. I bought this at Marshall&#x27;s for $30 and took it back, spent the extra $30, and bought the chi. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
    <li> got this terrific iron [...] awesome iron 4 the price, makes hair really shiny n soft, just dont like how it snags my hair every now n then but straighten thick hair very well</li>
    <li> I brought this flat iron for my sister as a Christmas gift. She loved it until last week when the ceramic plates fell off. To be fair, she did drop it once before it broke. However, she dropped in on carpet and the flat iron completley fell apart after she tried to use it after the fall. I know flat irons are not supposed to be battle proof but you would think a $40-50 flat iron would hold up to one fall. I previously brought her a $20 flat iron from Wal-Mart. It was definitely not as good as this flat iron was when it comes to quality of work but it held up for 2 years!</li>
    <li> Quick shipping, love this flat iron as it is dual voltage for my travels throughout the world.  My second cortex I&#x27;ve owned, love this brand better than Chi.</li>
    <li> I ordered this straightener after my salon stylist told me that she had gotten one and they are great well that is far from the truth or i just got a crappy one.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price...great value!! Heat control makes this so easy to use!! Heats up fast!!! thinking of purchasing a second one since the price is so reasonable!!!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this thing. I used to have a Chi, but it broke after 4 years of trusty service. My one gripe with it was that the temperature could not be controlled, and it did damage my hair quite a bit if I overused it (which I tended to do back when I was obsessed with having stick straight hair every day). This is perfect, temperature can be controlled with a little knob up to 450 degrees, but I find around 325 to be perfect and less damaging for my thick, curly hair. Leaves hair smooth and way less frizzy, and the floating plates make it easy to get whatever look you&#x27;re going for. These are affordable but totally high quality, mine has lasted me over 2 years now.</li>
    <li> I purchased my Cortex flat iron about 3 years ago and have used it almost every day since. I absolutely adore this iron! I definitely baby it when traveling, but you have to be extremely careful with anything ceramic! I find that the Vera Bradley curling/flat iron travel pouch is perfect for helping that case. But use common sense, if you drop it on a hard surface and the plate cracks, that&#x27;s not the manufacturer&#x27;s fault!   Someone else said that they are in discount stores for a reason, and that&#x27;s not necessarily true. Although I purchasd mine through amazon, after using mine, a friend purchased hers at TJ Maxx, and it has held up for 2 years, and still works just as well as it did when she bought it. It even came with a little mini straightener as well!   If you&#x27;re like me, and your hair is ridiculously wavy, but not quite curly, and your hair is super thick, then I can guarantee that you have found your straightener. But I&#x27;ve also let my friends who have thinner slightly wavy hair use it and it works for them as well! This iron is so amazing that I honestly will never use anything else again, and if the one I have now ever breaks for any reason, I will definitely repurchase.  Also use common sense in knowing that if you use this thing everyday without a heat protectant, yes it WILL burn your hair. But this is the case with any quality iron that can heat up to 425 degrees!  A quality heat protectant like Bed Head Guardian Angel runs you about $5 and is every bit worth it.   I hope you choose to purchase this iron, because honestly I have used over 10 different kinds in years past, and this is my favorite.</li>
    <li> The best purchase I&#x27;ve gotten online I don&#x27;t really trust buying items online but this Straightener is awesome. I love how it Makes my hair look it does everything it says it does.</li>
    <li> I thought that I was getting a different flat iron that I already have, but it&#x27;s the same one. The specifications given in the description are wrong. I like the flat iron, but is not what I wanted</li>
    <li> The product shown (with gold plates) was actually NOT the product i received. Granted, this was my third Cortex as I love these flat irons. I received the Platinum Edition with black plates. These are actually 2 different items, the seller needs to change picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the flat iron, it works well. Leaves hair shiny, heats up quickly, doesn&#x27;t snag hair....</li>
    <li> I had this product before (Cortex flat iron in pink) and I absolutely loved it. I had it for, I want to say 6 years and never had an issue until I broke one of plate on accident :/ and of course it would pull my hair so I had to purchase another one. I got the black one and I LOVE it I had no issues the product works perfect it leaves my hair straight and does not get frizzy I&#x27;ve tried other ones and don&#x27;t like them at alll, for the price and the way it works it&#x27;s PERFECT</li>
    <li> This is a nice flat iron for the value.  It heats up quickly &amp; does a good job.  The only fault I find with it is it doesn&#x27;t always glide easily through my hair.</li>
    <li> I used for the first a couple weeks ago. It worked great. It  really made my hair flat and smooth. I love it. For the price it works amazing.</li>
    <li> I have been a hairstylist for almost 20 yrs. I&#x27;m always looking for low cost products that have quality. I have gone completely natural and it straightens my hair just like a relaxer would.</li>
    <li> I love my flat itron!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gets hot fast, came in great condition, and shipping was right on time with the quote I GOT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much! I love it... Next on my list.. blow dryer :)</li>
    <li> I bought this one to replace an older version that broke after many years of use. This works just as good.</li>
    <li> My daughter and myself love this flat iron. It flattens hair effortlessly? It is the best flat iron I have ever used.</li>
    <li> The heat setting has to be on 400 degrees before it will curl my hair.  My old one (same brand) did not need to be that hot. Not sure if the thermostat is correct or if the iron is not heating like it should.</li>
    <li> At first, I was looking for the chi flat iron, but one of my friend told me about the cortex and how much she had bought it at the mall. I noticed that the price here was three time lower. So happy. I have been using it for over a year now. It works wonder. Every time I use it people ask me if I had my hair done at salon.</li>
    <li> My wife purchased this Flat Iron well over a year ago and it has been working perfectly that entire time.  She uses it pretty much every day with no problems and she is very happy with the results.  We also purchased this holder ([[ASIN:B004V9600U HSI PROFESSIONAL HIGH TEMPERATURE HEAT RESISTANT FLAT HAIR IRON STAND / HOLDER fits most 1 inch models]]) that fits this flat iron perfectly.  The Cortex Flat Iron has held up very well and was a great price.  Highly Recommended!</li>
