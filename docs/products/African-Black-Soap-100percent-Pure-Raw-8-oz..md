<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Lasts a long time, and I like that it makes my skin feel firm...</li>
    <li> Love this soap.  Controls adult acne and still leaves the skin soft, which at my age I need.</li>
    <li> After all the reviews, I was hopeful this might help with reducing the appearance of my eczema. It seemed to make no difference for me in that regard, or in helping my itchiness than using fragrance-free natural soaps from Trader Joe&#x27;s or Whole Foods (those do help my itch too, which is most important). This one, however, was much more likely to sting badly for a long period of time if I got even the slightest bit in my eyes, and it also seemed to burn on my skin at times. (Also, definitely do not rub it directly on your body due to the small &amp;#34;rocks&amp;#34; in it that will scratch you). I wouldn&#x27;t say don&#x27;t try it if you&#x27;re interested, but it&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
    <li> I used this product for about 1 week and noticed that it dried my skin out really badly and damaged my skin a bit too. It left me with scaled hyperpigmentation on my upper shoulder and chest area. I stopped using it immediately, it has been a few months and I still haven&#x27;t been able to get the damaged areas back to normal. I don&#x27;t know if its because I have sensitive skin or not but I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> My hubs liked it though. He had no issues</li>
    <li> I really Love raw african black soap. I love it for many reasons... cost of course being first on the list. It is extremely affordable and lasts a long time. I would also like to point out that this product will brighten skin imperfections with continued use. It is subtle... however; I have seen improvement in my complexion. Try it...</li>
    <li> It was all I needed it to be, and it last. You only have to use a little, just a little pinch and it will do the job. I use it on my face, its an excellent exfoliate. Ive always had clear skin, but this just have me looking more radiant without makeup, even the skin tone very well</li>
    <li> I have really oily and acne prone skin, I noticed a very refreshing look after one use! I haven&#x27;t experienced many flare-ups since using. It is a bit drying so it is important to also moisturize after each use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used Black soap and i&#x27;ve try so many different vendors but Natural Cosmetics has the best Black Soap Yet. I will continue to use them for all my Black Soap and Shea Butter.</li>
    <li> I received the soap 2 days earlier. Great soap. I use it on my skin and hair. Clears up psoriasis and eczema but it does irritate sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Good for all skin types. Your skin feels clean and the product feels natural. Plus it last a long time</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! It helps clear and even out my skin. It lightens my scars as well. Will definitely be buying again. I&#x27;ve had my current batch for 6 months now. I break off a chunk to use every month and store the rest away. It lathers A LOT and a little goes a very very long way.</li>
    <li> I love it! I love it! I love it! No more chemicals on my face! I use this to wash my hair and body too. I put little crums halfway in a pump container like an empty soap one and then I add water and a little vitamin e for preservative.. i shake it well and the next day it is liquid and ready to use. I have noticed some scars are fading from my face. I also use shea butter though. I would definitely recoment this soap, it does not smell awesome but the benefits are way better than an expensive soap full of chemicals</li>
    <li> This cleared my extremely stubborn acne of 10+ years in the last 2 months. Be sure to use plenty of moisturizer!</li>
    <li> Okay so I have used African Black Soap in the past and remember it kind of broke my face out. But decided to give it another whirl. :-/ I have oily skin and still struggle with acne scars and pimples from time to time and bought this soap as a hope to help me with a regimen for my face. This soap did not help. In fact it made my skin itchy, burn slightly and feel stiff. However, the soap did great when I used it as a body wash. It made my skin feel soft and he soap lathers great. It can last you forever because the soap lathers so much. I also used some for my hair. I am African American and my hair is texlaxed and i found my hair to be very dry after a Shampoo with this soap.</li>
    <li> I does what its supposed todo. I wish I would of bought more the first time around because i hate to keep buying things separately. But i use it as a body wash I did use it as a face wash but it was getting a little too drying to my face. But i feel so clean with i was my body with this you feel it like there is no dirt left on your body.</li>
    <li> The shipment was extremely fast... The soap is EXCELLENT quality. And the size of the soap will last a lifetime. (well maybe not a lifetime but u get the point) lol</li>
    <li> i use this as a cleanser. I&#x27;ve stopped using products that are made with chemicals. It really helped clear up my skin.</li>
    <li> Arrived in separate bundles.  This soap does its job and does not irritate my skin, and I have very dry skin.</li>
    <li> Very natural and you will feel clean...makes your face feel the way it should..slowly fades dark spots and pimples I like it alot</li>
    <li> It has an unusual scent. You can tell this is pure African black soap. The bar is huge compared to the amount you have to use. To wash my face about a pea size, if that. I expect this bar to last a VERY long time. Great value!</li>
    <li> It broke my skin out much worse. It gave it a dry and tight feeling. I had acne and burn rashes on my neck as well that I&#x27;ve never had before.</li>
    <li> Love it. Only had it for two day and my face have cleared up. Wonderful product</li>
    <li> makes your face squeaky clean. don&#x27;t use it everyday. is very drying. every other day would suffice. i used it whenever i wear mac makeup to make sure my face is fully clean. just clean your face with this soap, and follow with a good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This soap has chunks of very hard black stuff (I think it&#x27;s charcoal) which does not easily rub off.  The piece I got had a huge chunk right in the middle that would leave scratches on my body.  I had to eventually toss it as it just wasn&#x27;t any good.</li>
    <li> Dark marks are starting to fade! :) I really love this product works great on African skin and is not too rough</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!! I had never really heard of Black soap until I ordered it and fell in love with the product. It is long lasting and smells nice while keeping my skin moisturized</li>
    <li> Buy it, the soap really works I brought the 8 ounce and its huge still using it and it was affordable  love it.</li>
    <li> It is beautiful, homemade looking soap.  I love the quality!  Smells wonderful, feels wonderful.  I didn&#x27;t know this about african black soap, but apparently it turns your bath water brown.  Not to worry though, I think it just because of the ash driven lye.  This soap is doing wonders for my skin.  I have normal to oily skin and this is clearing up my acne, firms up my skin, and moisturizes as it cleanses.  Would give to family and friends as gift.  Great for everyone!</li>
    <li> If you are thinking aobut purchasing this product and you have skin problems buy it.  I have Eczema and a combination of treatment with Afrian Soap have my skin looking great.</li>
    <li> Excellent quantity, excellent price.  Wonderful product.  Easy to work with.  Received my soap as stated on the invoice.  Packaged very well.&lt;br /&gt;~anita</li>
    <li> I rarely get excema patches but I do get it when using acne treatments or salicylic acid. my skin broke out horribly on this like never before. It stripped my skin like crazy and I walked around like a lizard. thankfully im not vain and it finally went away. All I could use was cetaphil during that time because everything else burned! I will never use this again - I gave it away</li>
    <li> Been using every night and every morning for the past month. .. absolutely no change in my skin.  Still have dark spots and acne.  Not any smoother or anything.  Highly dissatisfied.</li>
    <li> It came wrapped tightly in plastic wrap. It cleanses my face thoroughly and has helped control my blemishes. First time trying this soap and was very pleased.</li>
    <li> I love this soap great for ur skin, came very quick!! and it does heal your skin quickly u truly notice it. I will be ordering more soon :-)</li>
    <li> My skin has changed immensely. No more acne or dark spots and overall skin glow.</li>
    <li> Broke my face out horribly 😡</li>
    <li> This is amazing soap if  you have any acne, it clears your face so fast. I use it 2x a day my teenage son is suffering from acne once he started using this soap we can tell the improvement I&#x27;m really pleased...</li>
    <li> I bought this because I planned to switch away from Dove soap, which I loved, but didn&#x27;t want to continue using (due to toxic chemicals in Dove products).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really tried to like the African Black Soap, but unfortunately it seemed to be fairly &amp;#34;uncured&amp;#34;, or there was still lye in parts of the soap, because it burned my skin when I used it. My skin is not incredibly sensitive but I continued to get stinging, red, burned skin in different patches after using this product. It is also quite gritty and has chunks of charcoal/ wood/ ash/ dirt in it. (Not sure what the substance is, looks like burnt wood mostly, and then some parts have a gritty sort of sand in it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have a large amount of this left (I bought the 5lb size), which I might start using for washing dishes just to get rid of it. Would not recommend this if your skin is at all sensitive.</li>
    <li> Such a nice product for acne.Great for oily skin.I liked it very much.</li>
    <li> I love this soap because it&#x27;s cheap and works wonders on my face. The first week took some adjusting as it was extremely drying. I supplemented this with moisturizing my face with virgin coconut oil. So now instead of buying high priced facial cleansers and moisturizers I use the two step black soap and coconut oil. My face glows and rarely breaks out.</li>
    <li> I like this soap. My son likes it even more. I do find it falls apart easily. I just squeeze it together and dry it out.</li>
    <li> Great soap, great value. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with this soap. People complain that they find sticks in it, but it is an all natural soap made from plants so what do you expect. It&#x27;s not like the typical smooth bars of soap found in stores. That&#x27;s just how you know you have the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; deal black soap.</li>
    <li> This was the first black soap I tried. I just remember not really being wowed by this soap after all the good things I had heard about black soap. Then I found bought the black soap being sold by natural-cosmetics here on amazon and fell in love with black soap. You get way more for the same price you get this one and the quality of product is different. This soap had a lot of the hard pebble things you find in black soap..to the point where it was a nuisance. It was such a long time ago that I tried this soap that I cant remember specifics but I remember feeling like this soap was just ok and being very bothered by how many rocks/pebbles/cocoa pods (whatever they are) were in the soap. It seemed to effect how well the soap stayed together and I dont remember any sort of reaction to the effect it had on my skin. Compared to the black soap I use now this one seems like a lesser quality.</li>
    <li> It was wayyyy too strong for my skin. I used it once and for thirty minutes my skin burned. I ended up throwing it away.</li>
    <li> When i used this soap i knew right away&lt;br /&gt;That i was not going to buy any other brand.The way it  made my skin feel was unreal.you just have to try it for your self.</li>
    <li> I have to admit the bag came with a large piece and several small pieces. It looked a little sketchy. But the soap has worked good so far... but from first looks I was a little worried.</li>
    <li> The packaging was not professional, but it did contain the most important substance that I needed and that is the soap itself. The soap lathers up with the smallest amount broken off of the bigger piece. Smells like oatmeal but not very strong. Clears out blackheads, stops new pimples from forming, those that have surface quickly vanish within a weeks time. Scars are beginning to lighten up after two weeks. After a month the \\&quot;newer scars\\&quot;- from newer pimples are gone after a months time) Old scars from a few months have lighten and can be covered with minimal makeup.</li>
    <li> Firstly, I want to say that I love using Natural Cosmetics&#x27; African black soap. I love the lather (only have to use a tiny piece), the smell (not heavily nor artificially scented), and most of all, I love how it makes my skin feel. Although I haven&#x27;t been consistent in using it, I did notice that my face began looking more glowy (without makeup)...and it also seemed as though my dark undereye circles were clearing up...that is, before I fell off with the usage. But, now I will begin using it more consistently in order to see what results will come of it. Also, the soap is so soft! When you break most soaps, they are hard and they snap in two (or 3) pieces. When you break the African black soap, it is so pliable, almost like Play-Do (lol)! I broke off a piece for my mom, who uses it to wash her hands, and she told me that a bump on her finger is healing from washing her hands with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, be very careful with the soap, because it MELTS in water! To combat this, what I do is I break off a piece of soap that I will use for a few days for showers until I used all of that piece. That way, the soap is not all gone within a matter of days lol! I&#x27;ve bought two 8 oz pieces, so I still have some left. The quality of this soap is even better than the kind that is sold in the health food stores. And I definitely plan to purchase additional African black soap from Natural Cosmetics, especially before I run out. Try it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9/3/2013 - I&#x27;m still using it and I still love it! I can tell a big difference in how my face looks. It&#x27;s almost time for me to order more soap. I still use it to bathe and wash my hair as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did my research and learned that real African Black soap is not suppose to be black! This raw soap has an amazing lather (a tiny bit goes a LONG way), smells very mild of good clean soap. I expect this 8 oz to last me for months upon months.</li>
    <li> I was eager to try this soap after hearing so many great things about it!  I kind of giggled at the wrapping because it came looking like a huge piece of fruitcake wrapped in plastic wrap, but I figured for the price, I really couldn&#x27;t expect super fancy wrapping.  This bar was a GREAT deal for the money. A teeny little pinch of the soap [about pea sized] lasted me about 4 face washings.  I did, however, make the mistake of actually rubbing the soap on my face rather than just lather it in my hands.  Yikes, talk about rough!  It totally scratched my face!  But live and learn, right?  The soap itself is great and it leaves my skin nice and soft.</li>
    <li> This soap is wonderful. It feels so good on the skin and smells good too. Also used for shampoo for my husband. It leaves the hair soft and shiney. Will be sending in for another order real soon. Thanks Amazon for a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I love this soap. It&#x27;s amazing. This is the first and last time I&#x27;m placing an order with this seller. The soap which arrived was nothing like the picture and I doubt it was 8oz. It was so small, it looked like I received someone&#x27;s leftover soap. Please, recalculate your measurements or reduce the price.</li>
    <li> trying to use up still good amount for the price</li>
    <li> I received the soap fast and I have been very pleased with its effectiveness. It works great as an all over body soap, as well as a shampoo.</li>
    <li> Besides it drying out my skin a little, I love this product.  My skin is very soft and looks good.  Just must use a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I was having trouble with adult acne and read about this soap.  I found it on Amazon and bought it.  It was only a  matter of a few days and the acne cleared up!  I couldn&#x27;t believe it worked so well so fast.  I have been using it for about a month now and love it!  I will be using this soap from now on.</li>
    <li> I was not sure if this would be what I expected upon recieving it.  I was pleased to find that it was a large bar of soap and it feels soft to the touch. Great quaility!</li>
    <li> Love the black soap,it makes my skin feel so soft an clean ! If you are thinking of making a purchase think no  more and go for it, you won&#x27;t be sorry. What could be better then all natural skin care in a world full of chemicals</li>
    <li> I ordered this after hearing all the rave reviews. I have trouble finding products that work on my skin. I got a few breakouts when I first started using it which I kind of expected with trying a new skin care product but I dont really see any significant changes. I have been using it for maybe 3+ months now until maybe I can find something else to try.</li>
    <li> This soap arrived in an untidy mess of a thin plastic wrap. Seriously?? Better packaging is necessary. Secondly, the soap was a crumbling mess. It could hardly hold together. It was as if a six-year-old decided to watch mother and make her own bar of soap! Third, it did nothing for me at all. It made my face very dry and the acne was still there. Luckily, someone told me about drinking aloe vera. I bought the plant, took it home and drank that over a few months... problem solved.</li>
    <li> Have been using it daily for about 3 weeks. I purchased if for my dark spots &amp; uneven skin tone Haven&#x27;t really seen results but I must say it makes my face soft.</li>
    <li> About five months ago, I ordered this, along with Shea Terra&#x27;s brand of African Black soap&lt;br /&gt;(http://www.amazon.com/Shea-Terra-Organics-Authentic-African/dp/B0046UCYA4/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1392840333&amp;sr&#x3D;8-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;shea+terra+black+soap).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should add that I purchased these because I have been looking for a more natural alternative to treating my onset of adult acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Shea Terra&#x27;s first and it made my face worse. I can&#x27;t even describe how terrible my face looked with all the bumps and zits, so I stopped using it, and put this in the back of my shelf thinking I&#x27;d get the same result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, where I currently live we have very harsh water that doesn&#x27;t agree with my sensitive skin and it would appear I have developed an eczema issue on parts of my face and neck. My doctor gave me a lotion, and because I don&#x27;t have a lot of choices in face wash here, I decided to try this bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month, and I haven&#x27;t had any terrible breakouts since. My face looks healthier and the dry patches had finally started to look normal again and weren&#x27;t irritating me as much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT...I decided to follow a friend&#x27;s advice and use a Dove bar on my face. THREE DAYS was all it took for my skin to go back to being dry and inflamed again. Not to mention this zit that&#x27;s slowly making an appearance on my cheek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a nutshell, this is the best thing I&#x27;ve used on my face thus far. I&#x27;m kicking myself because I know I&#x27;ve ruined the good thing I had going by trying the stupid Dove bar, but I know my face will go back to normal after a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually came back to save this particular brand for whenever I should need to order another one and figured, &amp;#34;Why not review something&#x27;s that&#x27;s helped me so immensely?&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Started using this when I lived in ni a little while ago fell in love the awesome for the face hood lather with just a small piece an 8 oz bar will go a long way.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap because I read the reviews  and it seemed promising for my acne breakouts.  The first time I washed my face with this soap it felt so clean.  After a few washes this soap actually burned my face.  My face was blotchy with dry patches all over.  I had to give it away.</li>
    <li> I had never seen this soap but I have used shay butter and liked the way it hydrated my skin. The soap is very good--cleans well and I use it as a shampoo as well as bath soap. I don&#x27;t need hair moisturizer when I use it. Good product.</li>
    <li> This soap is wonderful for eliminating blackheads. It does dry your skin out quite a bit so you will want to use a moisturizer. My teenage boys have been using it for several weeks and no longer have blackheads on their faces. I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Looks like some old molded rocks!! I won&#x27;t use it because it looks horrific!!</li>
    <li> This soap leaves your skin nice and soft, but is a bit harsh on delicate areas.  It lathers fine but gets used up quickly, too.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this soap and when i received it i was kind of wierd looking. I tried it and OMG it leaves your skin so soft and i will use this soap from now on. I will also purchase some for all of my friends.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you much.</li>
    <li> I Ordered This Soap Because This Is The Only Thing I Use On My Face, But When My Package Got Here It Was Full Of Bottles. No Soap!!!!</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t give an honest review because I&#x27;ve only had it for almost a month and it has not done what I particularly wanted it to do yet which was clear up my KP. Other than that, it makes your skin feel really clean. I can tell that my acne is clearing up little by little. I like it &amp; I will be buying another bar soon. I think it lasts for about 1 1/2 to 2 months.</li>
    <li> Kind of weird color and really hard should have left a softness but i didn&#x27;t feel it left that much.</li>
    <li> I saw improvements in my skin the next morning! This soap, paired with Jojoba oil, is the best thing you can do for your face.</li>
    <li> Works wonders for my skin!</li>
    <li> When it first arrived, my friend thought I bought a sketchy looking granola bar from Amazon. No, no I told her- this is a raw piece of African Black Soap. The name alone sounds like it has magical voodoo powers. Which, in fact does because once I started using this my face and body became clear of blemishes and my skin looking clearer than ever before. One thing to note is that it does dry your skin because the soap has no moisturizer instilled- however I also bought African Shea Butter and it works well together. Mmhm, this is a great buy, and it&#x27;s affordable. Try it.</li>
    <li> I had never tryed this product before but had heard about, read about and youtubed it. But I tryed it and wow. I like how you only need alittle and the lather that you get from it is really good. I got this to use on my face because I started to break out alittle bit&lt;br /&gt;on my chin after four years of being acene free from useing acutaine which also cleared my skin from breakouts since I was&lt;br /&gt;eight through my early fourtys. I did&#x27;nt want to go back to my derm just yet so I finally got this soap; it does dry your skin but not in&lt;br /&gt;a bad way. So mabe you won&#x27;t need to use it everyday or better yet not two times aday, I put vitamin e on my skin afterwards. I do say try this soap and I will buy&lt;br /&gt;again but it just may be awhile since it looks like what I have now is gonna last me.</li>
    <li> This soap really works well. The only issue Is that is gets really mushy in the water or if it sits in the dry shower.</li>
    <li> I lpve this soap very gentle when lathering don&#x27;t need to use to much and has cleared my acne and brightened my skin</li>
    <li> it really helped me with my acne</li>
    <li> This pure, unrefined soap was a miracle when i first used it. It toned my acne problem skin and helped reduce my acne bumps. The only negative is it melts so fast and oozes wherever you place it so its best to keep in its own separate soap dish.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love how this soap take care of my skin. The smell is very natural, so if you are not a fan of parfume-not-work-as-good soap you will really enjoy it.</li>
    <li> I love this soap. Ive been using it for years! I love the natural scent it has. And it leaves my body feeling nice and soft.</li>
    <li> I love this soap. I a need to buy more and I will buy from this seller. Everyone I give some of his to loves it. They say they&#x27;ve never felt so clean. I use this for my face, I have terrible acne and it&#x27;s so much better when I use this. This is a miracle soap!!!! ❤️❤️❤️</li>
    <li> I was excited when my order arrive. It was a little strange looking, only because it&#x27;s raw. I really liked the lather and it really didn&#x27;t have a scent but this product personally did not work for me. It seemed as it caused my face to breakout worse.....almost overnight I began to form several cystic pimples that hurt horribly. Everyone&#x27;s skin reacts differently to different products and unfortunately this one is not for me.</li>
    <li> This *Black Soap smelled earthly and refreshing, like other BS on the market. It gave me a clean...refreshing...tingly feeling on my body. The only downside was the packaging. It was cheaply &amp; poorly sealed. All *Black Soap should come in a box or container. If that changes then Ill give it five stars. Other than that. Does what its supposed to do.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product about a month ago &amp; I have definitely seen an improvement in my skin. It is a little drying but it makes my skin glow and I barely break out. I will be ordering more once I run out</li>
    <li> I prefer a grittier texture to my soap. This one is okay, but not great. Some of the other black soaps out there are much more coarse. As with many products in this category, this soap goes quickly and needs to be cut yourself unless you like using a huge block.</li>
    <li> Smells so clean. Not perfume-y. Very drying but I was expecting  that. I&#x27;m 50 with acne always on the lookout for help with my annoying skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 10/24/12 It&#x27;s really helping with my blackheads. It was mildly exfoliating especially on my nose but it has balanced out now. Not nearly as drying. Still using it daily. Lathers great.</li>
    <li> This soap has great lather and makes you feel clean. It is worth the money because it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap because I had an itchy rash on my arm and some reviews said this soap helped with itchy skin.  The fact that some reviews said that this soap helped clear and lighten their complexion wasn&#x27;t really the reason I bought it.  I started using it on my face and arm at night before going to bed.  It hasn&#x27;t really helped the rash from an allergice reaction, but I am getting comments from my co-workers and friends every day about how good my face looks.  I have seen these results in just a couple of weeks.  I am 59, and have to use a really good facial moisturizer after washing with the soap, but I will definitely be buying more.  Delivery was very prompt and packaging was good.  The bars are wrapped in plastic wrap and you just cut off a piece to use.  The other reviewers are right about keeping it out of water.... it will dissolve right before your eyes.  But, if you keep it dry in a well-drained soap dish, a sliver will last several days.  I&#x27;ve used about a quarter of one bar in two weeks, but I use it as a bath soap as well.</li>
    <li> I love it I&#x27;m glad I found out about it so take it from me it makes your skin feel so soft.</li>
    <li> The soap looks like the picture listed. Haven&#x27;t used it yet but it looks legit. I&#x27;d give it a 5 but the packaging was cheap.</li>
    <li> You just won&#x27;t find a better value.  I used this soap after having laproscopic surgery and I do believe that it helped minimize some of my scarring.</li>
    <li> This product not any good for my skin, my skin dried out and make my skin itchy,and bump all over turned to  red. I bought this product becase I saw really good rating here.May be it&#x27;s works to some people not for all.Specially not good  for sensitive skin</li>
    <li> I received the package of soap on time, as promised. At first I was very skeptical because it looked shady but this soap works wonders! My horrible and very visible acne scarring has gotten a lot better just using this soap and my oily skin is more balanced now, this is a great product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap in the shower as body wash.  I put some in a small bottle, added water and shake before squeezing it onto body puff.  I also keep some in a pump bottle next to kitchen sink so I don&#x27;t have to use harsher soaps.  I enjoy the smell and it doesn&#x27;t dry me out like regular body washes.</li>
    <li> I have been using african black soup to control my acne and dark spots for over a year now.  it is part of my regime which include aubrey organics cleanser and toner; and raw shea butter.  My skin glows, my pores are almost invisible.  Take care though it will sting your eyes and don&#x27;t use it to scrub your face or use it too frequently.  I wash with it no more than 3 times per week.</li>
    <li> This is a great soap. It lathers well and last a very long time. It leaves me with a clean fresh feeling.</li>
    <li> I purchased this soap after reading reviews on how well is seems to work for blackheads in the skin. It does work, but for me I can only use it occasionally due to how much it dries my face out.  I do use it still more on my back where i still may get occasional breakouts and it does the job well.  You will need to moisturize afterwards like I do, but that&#x27;s just part of the routine.</li>
    <li> I use it for face and body and love the softening and cleansing effect. I gave half of my bar to my daughter and son in law and they love it , too</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Great value. I cut the bar into smaller chunks to increase the longevity of the product.</li>
    <li> This soap is wonderful leaving my very sensitive skin soft, clean and moisturized. I would highly recommend this product, especially for those with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This is the best soap I have ever used. I really think it makes a difference in my skin and totally reduces inflammation in areas in need of TLC.</li>
    <li> I purchase this soap before and my only disappointment is that it came way smaller than before.  Love using this soap it has helped me tremendously!</li>
    <li> Love the product but I must not have read everything it only came with one bar</li>
    <li> I purchased this from Natural Cosmetics.  It arrived very promptly.  The bar is rather soft, so you can easily cut it into smaller blocks with a sharp knife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this soap over several days.  Each time, I felt a stinging/burning sensation on my cheeks while I was washing my face.  The sensation remained even after I rinsed the soap off and would start subsiding only after I put jojoba oil on my face.  I feel like this soap seriously dries out my skin.  It does leave it feeling squeaky clean and tight, but not in a good way - your skin feels almost stripped after using it.  The soap feels harsh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to take a break from this soap and try a different brand of black soap.  I&#x27;ll come back to it after a while to see if it has the same effect and update my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I tried the Nubian Heritage brand of black soap. It smells delicious. However, it also leaves my skin feeling stripped, although it does not burn. I guess my skin doesn&#x27;t like black soap.</li>
    <li> I have Dark Acne around my cheeks bone area and curious on which product to used to clear my face</li>
    <li> I used it last night and it made my skin/face feel so clean! I am hoping to also help with complexion!</li>
    <li> This soap is very alkaline so it does dry your skin out. But I follow up with a toner and a moisturizer and I&#x27;m fine. I won&#x27;t use any other soap on my face, this does something wonderful to my skin!</li>
    <li> When I received this soap, it was a big chunk so I decided to cut it into smaller pieces and that worked well and has lasted a long time. Just as the other reviewers mentioned, do not leave it in the shower as it will disintegrate. I usually just leave it next to my shower on a wooden soap dish. Since the soap is a bit gritty, I use a shower sponge. It does work really well for clearing up skin, but it worked from the inside out for me so I broke out for a little while but now my skin looks good. Also, it does tend to dry up your skin so be sure to use a good moisturizer for face and body. Pure shea butter would work best.</li>
    <li> This soap came in a huge block. I should have cut it into pieces, but I didn&#x27;t. It stuck to everything in my shower, and didn&#x27;t hold it&#x27;s shape very well. It made such a mess!</li>
    <li> hello my name is nanetta and I really love this soap do u have any more it is the only soap that works for my skin my email address is nmanigualt@epbfi.com  thanks</li>
