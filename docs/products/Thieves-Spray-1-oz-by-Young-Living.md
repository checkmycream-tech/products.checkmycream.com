      <li>and it&#x27;s many uses.</li>
      <li>Love the scent.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s everything it is advertised to be, love the smell</li>
      <li>Not only does these oils do what they say, the customer service is excellent.</li>
      <li>Love thieves  </li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>However, if I do, it has a nice fragrance and more importantly it&#x27;s all natural products and a very important thing to have in a survival kit.</li>
      <li>It has made a huge difference in our lives</li>
      <li>OK the spray is great, but in order for it to have maximum efficacy it needs to be guaranteed fresh and in proper storage or else</li>

      <li>Have been using Thieves Oil for 8 months on various areas and it works great.</li>

      <li>but I love the smell so much</li>
      <li>I was very interested in learning about Thieves oils, and I read everything I could find.  </li>
      <li>Works great for those moments when you want a quick spray for little jobs.</li>
      <li>We clean first with Borax and then apply the Thieves Oil.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not cost effective and I&#x27;ve since found that I can buy many essential oils and not even be anywhere near this price point per ounce.</li>
      <li>Great stuff - a terrific natural alternative to disinfecting a surface.  </li>
      <li>You will love this oil,carry one in my auto and several places in my home.</li>
      <li>Came fast and is exactly what was pictured.</li>
      <li>I am a yoga teacher and teach in a Corporate setting, where they won&#x27;t let me light candles, or use incense.  </li>
      <li>In a few days the spot had festered up, drained on its own, and was gone with no complications.  </li>
      <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>After several family members and friends have suffered with the MRSA bacteria, I felt the urge to do my own research for natural ways to combat this and other viruses, etc.  </li>
      <li>If you are going to buy at this price point, guarantee yourself that it works by purchasing directly off Young Living.</li>
      <li>thanks for getting this to me in such  a timely fashion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;love</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll continue to keep this around; it&#x27;s worth the effort when antibiotics offer little, or no, help.  </li>
      <li>THIS IS NOT A YOUNG LIVING ACCOUNT, it&#x27;s simply someone re-selling (probably old) products.</li>

<li> But, too expensive to but as often as I would like to.</li>
<li> But, it&#x27;s just way too expensive and I will no longer be buying this.</li>
<li> Expensive</li>
<li> I got this because we all get sick in the winter</li>
<li> I bought this to spray around when sick people are around me.</li>
<li> I was disappointed in this product because it was in a plastic bottle and seemed to be a knock off</li>
<li> I sprayed once a day and did not get sick at all during flu season &amp; after!</li>

    <li> smells wonderful and it&#x27;s nice to know it&#x27;s killing germs too.</li>
    <li> Have been fighting black mold in a house we obtained. Our daughter has had black mold poisoning 2 times requiring hospitalization and recommended this product. We knew Clorox would only temporarily rid the black mold. Have been using Thieves Oil for 8 months on various areas and it works great. Mold has not returned to the areas where we have applied the oil. We clean first with Borax and then apply the Thieves Oil. Smells like a mixture of spices. Very pleasant. Has been successful in our circumstance. Recommend for treating black mold.</li>
    <li> OK the spray is great, but in order for it to have maximum efficacy it needs to be guaranteed fresh and in proper storage or else the essential oils won&#x27;t have the same effect. If you are going to buy at this price point, guarantee yourself that it works by purchasing directly off Young Living. If you purchase from here, the product might not be as good or effective as it should be. THIS IS NOT A YOUNG LIVING ACCOUNT, it&#x27;s simply someone re-selling (probably old) products.</li>
    <li> We use Thieves spray during flu/cold season for protection &amp; it works!!!!  Great product.</li>
    <li> Smells great! I bought this to spray around when sick people are around me. I drive a school bus and I will spary it when the kids get off to kill grems floating around. Smells wonderful. Kids say it smells like Christmas on the bus!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in this product because it was in a plastic bottle and seemed to be a knock off</li>
    <li> Love, serves so many purposes. But, too expensive to but as often as I would like to. Amazing oil though.</li>
    <li> i used this spray constantly when my husband got  a chest cold and I did not get it, and I get everything!  Maybe i won&#x27;t now!</li>
    <li> thanks for getting this to me in such  a timely fashion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;love to all!</li>
    <li> I bring it daily in my bag and spray on dirty surface. So far very good,</li>
    <li> Thieves oil is great.  It has cured many things for me: everything from mold (in my lungs) to a corn/wart on my leg.  Smells awesome too.</li>
    <li> This I keep in my purse.</li>
    <li> Not only does these oils do what they say, the customer service is excellent. Included a hand written note thanking me for my order. This goes far beyond what is expected,  especially in this day.  Would highly recommend. You will love this oil,carry one in my auto and several places in my home.</li>
    <li> I am a yoga teacher and teach in a Corporate setting, where they won&#x27;t let me light candles, or use incense.  I just spray Thieves when I come into the room I am teaching in and it immediately transforms the from from a trainning room, into a comfortable yoga space.</li>
    <li> I used this to spray as an air freshener and also to spay in the return vents of the HVAC. But, it&#x27;s just way too expensive and I will no longer be buying this. It&#x27;s not cost effective and I&#x27;ve since found that I can buy many essential oils and not even be anywhere near this price point per ounce. Sorry Young, you just got pushed out by smarter shopping. Not better marketing.</li>
    <li> I have never used the spray before and was always a devotee of the cleaner. This exceeded my expectations as spray</li>
    <li> I use this in my classroom on computer keyboards, light switches, phone, etc. I&#x27;m immuno-compromised and it disinfects without having to endure the alcohol smell.</li>
    <li> its seemed to do the job. spray all over the house when someone was coughing to kill any airborne germs</li>
    <li> Great product...Love the scent....</li>
    <li> Great stuff - a terrific natural alternative to disinfecting a surface.  Bonus: Smells a little like Christmas.  :)</li>
    <li> Works great for those moments when you want a quick spray for little jobs.</li>
    <li> Excellent spray, fragrance is strong but good, works well on Athletes feet.</li>
    <li> Awesome for freshening up</li>
    <li> I have beeen using this spray on my toenails for two weeks and it is already working to heal them.</li>
    <li> Love the spray.  Love the scent.</li>
    <li> Prayerfully I&#x27;ll never have to use this stuff.  However, if I do, it has a nice fragrance and more importantly it&#x27;s all natural products and a very important thing to have in a survival kit.</li>
    <li> Expensive but it is good for many uses.</li>
    <li> After several family members and friends have suffered with the MRSA bacteria, I felt the urge to do my own research for natural ways to combat this and other viruses, etc.  I was very interested in learning about Thieves oils, and I read everything I could find.  After purchasing the product, I&#x27;m happy to say that it seems to work well.  A family member had MRSA on his arm and we used the product just to see what would happen.  In a few days the spot had festered up, drained on its own, and was gone with no complications.  I&#x27;ll continue to keep this around; it&#x27;s worth the effort when antibiotics offer little, or no, help.  Use your own judgment, but we like it.</li>
    <li> This is the only stuff that kills mold.</li>
    <li> this is the probably the best thing I have ever used for allergies. It has made a huge difference in our lives</li>
    <li> Came fast and is exactly what was pictured.</li>
    <li> I sprayed once a day and did not get sick at all during flu season &amp; after!</li>
    <li> My must have throat spray! Nightly before bed to keep allergies and sinus issues at bay as well as colds.</li>
    <li> Love having this in my hand bag at all times!  Love thieves  It works!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s everything it is advertised to be, love the smell and it&#x27;s many uses. Won&#x27;t ever be without Thieves Oil</li>
    <li> I got this because we all get sick in the winter but I love the smell so much I spray it all the time. I got two bottles, one for home and one for work. The smell is clovey with a hint of cinnamon &amp; citrus.</li>
