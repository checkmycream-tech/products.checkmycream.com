      <li>shave is just wonderful, and the value absolutely can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
      <li>So by comparison I couldn&#x27;t really be the best judge.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t select them because they are cheap, but because they are good.</li>
      <li>I can get about a week out of a blade before having to replace them, which means that for around $10 I can go almost two years without buying any more blades.</li>
      <li>I tied the remaining blades on a weekend when I made sure my prep was flawless with the same results.  </li>
      <li>Great blades and very affordable.  </li>
      <li>That more than I can say for the blades I have purchased at CVS or Walgreens.</li>
      <li>different blades and see which ones work best for you.</li>
      <li>but I with it had more lather.</li>
      <li>Could not be more pleased with this item.  </li>
      <li>Avoid and buy a better blade.</li>
      <li>Since then there haven&#x27;t been any more hair-loss</li>
      <li>These work out to about 16 cents per shave, and, I get a much better shave.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve since moved on to Derby blades which I feel are much better suited to a beginner.  </li>
      <li>Buffing technique was ok.</li>
      <li>It did a better job using a 4 pass beard reduction.</li>
      <li>There are better and cheaper choices out there.</li>
      <li>Really a nice shave and smooth is not the word for it.</li>
      <li>I guess that&#x27;s an ok deal.</li>
      <li>These razonr blades are really good and worth the price.</li>
      <li>Still love them.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a retired tool maker and notice that 1 out of 5 blades from each pack are okay;</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using these blades for several months and I&#x27;ve very happy with them.  </li>
      <li>But that is okay</li>
      <li>Very happy with these Russian made blades.</li>
      <li>Need I say more?</li>
      <li>So why pay more.</li>
      <li>The razor do this job well and having 100 of them means that I don&#x27;t have to try and squeeze out too many shaves with one blade.  </li>
      <li>I love the quality and throw-away price of these razors.</li>
      <li>Now on the 4th or 5th shave and getting better.</li>
      <li>it will be 2-YEARS until I need to buy any more since I change them out once a week.</li>
      <li>It gives me a very fresh feeling after my morning shave, and has an amazing smell which isn&#x27;t overpowering at all.</li>
      <li>Its got a comfortable weight to it, keeps its brilliant chrome finish, and clean up is quick and easy.</li>
      <li>If you have a normal to fine beard, these blades are a great value.</li>
      <li>This blade really sucked for me but it might be good for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
      <li>If your ready to make the switch to a superior, and cheaper, alternative then check out the products below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Other than that, they are awesome blades.</li>
      <li>For me, the shave easily lasts longer than the disposable.  </li>
      <li>4 months going strong.</li>
      <li>Sharp, cheap, awesome!</li>
      <li>I posted my review on the othe 35 razors in another post, but found the Feather&#x27;s to be the best blades of all the brands I&#x27;ve tried, and Astra&#x27;s to be a pretty close second</li>
      <li>I used it in my ReMei razor and it did a good job removing two day’s worth of stubble on the first pass.</li>
      <li>Seem to work just fine.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t get through a full three-pass shave without applying more pressure to the razor than with which I felt comfortable.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t notice a huge difference from the merkur blades.</li>
      <li>If you want a smooth shave, do yourself a favor and spring for the Merkur blades.  </li>
      <li>There are great double edge safety razor blades.</li>
      <li>I swap them out 2-3 times a week and don&#x27;t care because they are so cheaply replaced.</li>
      <li>These blades are cheap and they work for me.</li>
      <li>The fact that they are cheap is an added bonus.</li>
      <li>I personally find the Swiss 7a.m. blades to be a great value.  </li>
      <li>I bought these because they were cheap.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> these razors are great and so inexpensive compared to others. it has been a year and i am still working through this initial purchase.</li>
    <li> After reading the benefits of using a classic safety razor, and being frustrated by the continually rising costs of modern razors, I made the switch, purchasing these along with a Merkur razor.  These are an exceptional value, having sufficient quality at a great price.  They provide a good shave, and they last longer than expected.</li>
    <li> I bought these to use with my [[ASIN:B000NL0T1G Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor]] and haven&#x27;t had any problems whatsoever. Even if each blade only lasts a week, I will still be set for the next 2 years.  This feels like a steal compared to cartridge razors. I normally find that each one lasts between 1 and 2 weeks depending on the frequency of use. Since I don&#x27;t shave every day, so they usually last close to 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used two. At this rate, 100 will last me for several years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far no problems.</li>
    <li> These razors are ok but seem to get dull quickly with my beard.  Unfortunately, I bought the razors before reading recommendations by others conerning guys who have just switched over to safety razors.  If you haven&#x27;t bought these razors before, please don&#x27;t buy them in a 100 pack.  Buy them in a 10 pack, along with others such as Feather, Merkur, etc.  As others have said, all blades are not the same.  What works well for my beard may not work well for someone else.  Also, don&#x27;t be afraid to buy another razor.  I started out with a Parker and then after 6 months or so I bought a Merkur and like the second razor much better.</li>
    <li> There are great double edge safety razor blades. I&#x27;ve used 7am blades since I have started using a safety razor (about six months ago) so i cannot comment on how \\&quot;other\\&quot; brands are at shaving(most are made out of the same material but with different finishes... please tell me if there is a difference in the blades?!?), but i can say these get the job done!! I can usually get about four or five shaves (when it only takes one swipe of the razor to remove hairs.) with each blade. I can stretch the uses but they are not as sharp and takes longer to shave.</li>
    <li> I used these for a few weeks before I tried the Merkur razors.  It&#x27;s night and day.  These seem dull compared to the Merkur.  These are great for beginners trying to get better at shaving.  I have a thick beard, so the sharper the better.  I gave these 3 stars because they were very forgiving and made it easy to learn.</li>
    <li> First off I would try as many different blades you can get your hands on.  I like different blades for different reasons.  For me these are great blades for the money. 100 blades for 16 bucks.  Sharp enough to get me through about a week of daily shaving.  They are not the sharpest by any means.  But that can have its advantages.  I find a closer shave from feathers and other brands but I don&#x27;t cut myself with these.  I especially like them for shaving my head.  With some sharper blades I have had some unpleasant cuts on the dome.  Great Value and meets my needs!</li>
    <li> I use these razors for DE razor shaving.  Not much to report here.  The razor do this job well and having 100 of them means that I don&#x27;t have to try and squeeze out too many shaves with one blade.  2 - 3 shaves and then replace. They should last at least a year.</li>
    <li> These are definitely the cheapest blades I saw and for 100 @ $15, it was something I couldn&#x27;t pass up. I have no idea what a \\&quot;good\\&quot; blade is like but these are so cheap, that at the hint of any dullness, it goes into the recycle bin and I pop on another. I don&#x27;t shave too often but I have a very thick beard with coarse hair so I think any blade would be punished by my beard.</li>
    <li> These blades are sharp.  They get the job done.  Did not come with plastic container to dispose of used blades which I was accustomed to.  But each blade is individually wrapped, so using that packaging to dispose of blades works too.  All in all, cannot complain about these.</li>
    <li> A durable and sharp blade.  I can get 5 or more shaves from a single DE blade without any tugging/pulling or razor burn.  Great for my fine beard.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these blades for several months and I&#x27;ve very happy with them.  They stay sharp for three or four weeks depending on how often I shave.  Besides being sharp they have all the other things I want in blades: they fit in my handle and they cut my beard more than my face.</li>
    <li> Its an ok shave but not nearly as close as my Mach lll. I&#x27;ll keep practising. Let you know in a month or so.</li>
    <li> These are TERRIBLE.  Looking at the blades they have a lot of tooling marks and aren&#x27;t very polished.  The edges have visible rough edges.    I wish I never found these on Amazon. Avoid and buy a better blade.</li>
    <li> While razor blades vary from person to person, I had to throw in my two cents here.  These blades feel pretty terrible, and appear to be a blatant attempt at fooling customers into buying the wrong blade when they&#x27;re actually looking for Gilette 7 o&#x27;clock blades.</li>
    <li> These blades are terrible.  If you&#x27;re into cutting yourself, then these are the blades for you.  If you want a smooth shave, do yourself a favor and spring for the Merkur blades.  If I could give it a lower rating, I would.</li>
    <li> These are great blades for new double edge shavers. I have a very thick and course beard and shave every day with these. They are not the sharpest blades but they do provide a good close shave with proper technique and you don&#x27;t have to worry about cutting yourself up. I can get 3-4 shaves per blade out of these but that is no different than the results I got with Gillette cartridge razors so I am still saving money!</li>
    <li> You get a crap load of blades that are good for a about 4 or 5 shaves in my opinion.  They work well but ive definitely had better blades at better price points.</li>
    <li> For me, this was literally a mixed bag, or rather, box.  I only began wet shaving using a traditional double-edged safety razor.  I purchased these blades (naively) after a recommendation in a review for my Merkur razor, and after seeing the low price.  At first, I had great success with these blades - a really close shave every day, and each blade seemed to last about a week.  As I got further into the hundred blade box, however, I encountered blades with dull sides, which provided a really uncomfortable pulling sensation on my beard. Soon I was finding entire five blade packets like this.  Now I have to rummage through the box for sharpened blades.    Do yourself a favor: if you&#x27;re new to traditional wet shaving, don&#x27;t make the mistake of buying a one hundred-blade box until you&#x27;ve found a brand that you&#x27;re comfortable with, and that you find to be consistent.</li>
    <li> in short these razors are good they do not grab your face do not cut you and last 2-3 weeks I flip mine after every shave.  these are far better than the wilkinson blades IMO.</li>
    <li> I just finished my second 100 and am starting on my third. I have never had a single problem with these blades. That more than I can say for the blades I have purchased at CVS or Walgreens. I have never once wished I had ordered another brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read the concerns about quality or suitability for sensitive skin and thick beards. I have never once had a bad blade. As for the tough guys with facial hair that is too manly for a normal blade to cut, try buying a small pack of these first. I probably wouldn&#x27;t commit to 100 of these until you know they will work as well for you as they do for me (a dude that must have really wimpy facial hair).</li>
    <li> Seems to be a little sharper than the Sharks. I used it in my ReMei razor and it did a good job removing two day’s worth of stubble on the first pass. I used the 3 pass beard reduction technique and it did a good job. Buffing technique was ok. It did a better job using a 4 pass beard reduction. I stopped using the blade after a week but it still had some life in it (I wanted to try another blade).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the Weishi (my usual razor), the buffing technique works well on two days growth. Terrible on 4 days. Beard reduction would probably have worked well.</li>
    <li> Totally changed how I shave, and has saved me a lot of money.</li>
    <li> The pack size is great for the price, it will take forever to go through them.  I get a very close shave.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the worst shave I&#x27;ve had so far. Been going through a sampler pack and decided to try out the 7a.m&#x27;s. Same prep as with every other blade I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tore up my face good. And it wasn&#x27;t even a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;As usual, your mileage may vary. This blade really sucked for me but it might be good for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just FYI: These are actually made in a factory in BANGLADESH. They are not from Switzerland in any fashion.</li>
    <li> I knew I liked 7am because I tried out a pack of them in a sampler. These blades are cheap and they work for me.</li>
    <li> great shave for a great price, shipped fast, tried theses as part of a 100 blade sampler.  exactly what i wanted.</li>
    <li> Great product. Each blade individually wrapped. Cost savings in bulk. Fits the Merkur long handled razor. For some reason blades stay sharper longer.</li>
    <li> [...] They rust after two shaves, and they skip all over my face, chopping and irritating it.  [...]</li>
    <li> Got these along with a Merkur Long Handled Razor the other day. First shave was okay, but not anything to talk about. Having to learn how to run it around on my face is new. Now on the 4th or 5th shave and getting better. Really a nice shave and smooth is not the word for it. I am very pleased compared with the Mach 2 blades I had been using for dozens of years. Wish I had decided to go old fashioned a long time ago.</li>
    <li> I have a very thick beard, and these razors work well enough on the first pass, but tend to not make it through the first shave. If you have a normal to fine beard, these blades are a great value. If you have at coarse, thick beard with sensitive skin, these are not for you.</li>
    <li> I made the move to safety razors at the end of 2009, this was my first purchase of razor blades. So I am posting this review almost four years later. I bought 100 7am blades and I have about 70 left today. I made the same mistake many people are citing here - newbies buying razor blades in bulk. Wet shaving is very much a Your Mileage May Vary (YMMV) thing, these don&#x27;t work for me but they can for others. I recommend looking at the review section of the Badger and Blade website and starting with various 5-packs and trying different blades with different razors, before committing to 100 blades. These blades never hacked me up - they just don&#x27;t provide a close shave and dull easily. So I guess they may be good for a safety razor newbie. The delivery was excellent as I recall.</li>
    <li> I bought these as my first shot back at double edged shaving. I get barely one shave per blade. It is a decent shave.  The blades do not seem particularly sharp, but are adequate.  For a value, they seem decent.  It was costing me .50 cents each for disposables that shaved poorly, and were cutting me on a consistent   basis. These work out to about 16 cents per shave, and, I get a much better shave.  They are a good learners blade, since with my   fixed Merkur razor they do not seem to cut me.  The Merkur blade that came with the razor lasted 6 shaves, and was much sharper.  It runs between 50 and one dollar per blade.  It seemed MUCH sharper, and kept it&#x27;s edge.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy these again, but, they make an excellent starters blade.</li>
    <li> Great blades and very affordable.  Well for me the blades last for about 6-9 shaves before I replace them.  It&#x27;s super sharp and gets the job done.  Just make sure to go slow when shaving with these blades, or else you might knick yourself pretty bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not that these blades are bad, but I decided to go back to using my Mach 3 blades, because it just took too long to shave with these blades, due to safety factors, which I stated above.  With these blades, it took me about 6-7 minutes to get a close shave, while 3 minutes or even less with the Mach 3.  One thing for sure is that with these blades, you&#x27;ll definitely get a much closer shave than using a Mach 3 blade. The difference is like night-and-day when comparing the two.  Shaving time, no pun intended, was more of a factor for me, so that is the reason why I reverted back to using Mach 3&#x27;s instead.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t notice a huge difference from the merkur blades. Seem to work just fine.I get about 3 shaves per blade.</li>
    <li> Last set of these that I purchased lasted me for about three years.  I love the quality and throw-away price of these razors.</li>
    <li> I get  3 to 4 shaves out of a blade. For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.  I tried the more expensive blades and got the same results. So why pay more.</li>
    <li> Sharp, cheap, awesome! Need I say more?</li>
    <li> I bought these because they were cheap. They last a while and cut hair, just like they are supposed to. Also at the price point, it&#x27;s less costly to put in a new blade whenever you want, increasing the quality of your shave. I&#x27;d recommend them to other users of double sided safety razors.</li>
    <li> I have been using these razor blades for a month now and am very please with the performance and price.  I shave my head as well and these razors last me 3 days each, they would probably last longer but at 14 cents a blade I don&#x27;t mind wasting them, especially when it costs me less than $1 per month, versus $5-6 with normal razors.</li>
    <li> These blades are excellently price and do an adequate job of getting a close shave with my Merkur razor.  It&#x27;s the closest shave I&#x27;ve gotten, though I haven&#x27;t tried other double edge razor blades on my merkur.  There is no snagging of my facial hair with a fresh 7.a.m. blade.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price. These work great with my vintage Gillette safety razor. I&#x27;d buy again, in 10 years when I run out.</li>
    <li> Forget about shaving your head with these blades. They simply aren&#x27;t designed for that kind of application. Fortunately I can use them on my face, however, I can only get a single shave out of one blade. I use one edge for the first pass and I use the other edge for a final pass to get a close shave. Then I throw the blade away. I guess that&#x27;s an ok deal.</li>
    <li> These blades are not as sharp or don&#x27;t give me as close of a shave as the single blade that came with my Merkur safety razor. So if you want a quality sharp and close shave. Go with the Merkur blades.</li>
    <li> Having tried a variety pack after switching to a double edge razor, I found these to be as good or better than others.</li>
    <li> These are the best blades I have come across.  Especially if you go old school and don&#x27;t want to play the marketing game with Gillette or the other major razor blade companies.</li>
    <li> The shave was smooth, but plan on only 1 use per blade.  They dull up very quickly.  I gave them a try, but I won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
    <li> These razonr blades are really good and worth the price. I would recommend them to my friends and anybody else.</li>
    <li> I purchased these blades at the recommendation of another reviewer here on Amazon and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I think each blade needs to be reviewed separately (in that there are many different vendors and suppliers of double edged safety razor blades).  Somewhere on Amazon is a sample pack; try that.  It contains blades from all sorts of styles and types.  I personally find the Swiss 7a.m. blades to be a great value.  You get 100 blades, and you can use each blade twice, sometimes three times before tossing it.  There&#x27;s so many in a box that you don&#x27;t feel bad tossing them and moving to a fresh one for a clean and safe shave.</li>
    <li> I find I have to use a new blade twice a week. These are still WAY cheaper than buying the multi-blade units from the big companies. I do have a heavy beard so maybe guys without such a course beard will get a week out of them. Other than that, they are awesome blades.</li>
    <li> I thought it would be cool to try shaving old school.  I did not want to try the strait razor so I thought I would try this out.  There is a reason they up graded the razor blade.  It is a pain but it is cheaper then modern blades.  If you don&#x27;t mind more work its a good product. Just not for me.</li>
    <li> Bought a high-end Merkur adjustable double-edge razor (set to 2.5) and the small assortment of blades consisting of Merkur (almost too sharp), Derby (very good), Lords (average), Dorco (Korea, several nicks), Astra (Russian, OK to start, rough at the end), Apollo (Germany, too aggressive, discarded), Treet (Pakistan, good to start, poor at the end), Sharp (Dhaka/England, good with a few nicks), and 7a.m. (best of the lot - always smooth and long-lasting).  As with anything this personal, your results will probably be different, just too many variables.  If you&#x27;re used to a multi-blade disposable, give your face a while to toughen before you render final judgement on a double-edged razor.  For me, the shave easily lasts longer than the disposable.  I do keep the multi-blade around (used in the shower) for vacations and the odd times I&#x27;m really in a rush.</li>
    <li> The 7 a.m. blades aren&#x27;t that bad - I really can&#x27;t add all that much different from every other reviewer. They are sharp and work well for what they are designed for. I can get about a week out of a blade before having to replace them, which means that for around $10 I can go almost two years without buying any more blades. Can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
    <li> Safety razor blades all look the same but everyone&#x27;s face is slightly different. These work great for me, but might be awful for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend getting this variety pack first:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Double-Safety-Razor-Blade-Variety/dp/B0038KA5RC&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try different blades and see which ones work best for you. The 7am blades are my favorite by far. I have a rough beard area and my neck is bumpy. Other blades slice me up like cheese, while these blades glide over the bumps without any razor burn and rarely do they cut my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of closeness, these are about as close as I can get. No blade: safety, cartridge, or electric gets a super close shave for me because my skin is rough. Electric leaves splotches of hair it cannot reach; cartridges are super-expensive and give me razor burn while leaving too much behind; safety razors in general do not irritate my skin and get close enough. The 7am blades get about as close as any blade for me, while leaving a very short layer of stubble due to my rough skin. But that is okay, I like the rustic look and so does my wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using these blades for over six months and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> I use these blades with my merkur razor, and it is a perfect shave every time, The blades stay sharp for a long time, at my current usage rate, I expect this pack will last me for more than a year. Highly recommend this product, and have send several friends to it. Thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with double edge blades for a year or two now.  I took other&#x27;s advice and bought a sampler pack first.  I tried Feather, Derby, Treat, 7 &#x27;Oclock, 7 am, Wilkenson Sword, and maybe a couple others I can&#x27;t remember.  Everyone has different skin and beards and therefore not everyone will have the same results.  I found that these were sharp enough to get a close shave, but not too sharp (like Feather) that my face was bleeding everywhere.  I can&#x27;t guarantee you will have the same success with these like I did, but they suit me fine.  Buy a small quantity of these (or any brand you&#x27;re considering) if you haven&#x27;t used them before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I love double edge blades.  I like many others got tired of paying nearly fifty bucks for 15 - 20 Gillette cartridges even at warehouse club prices.  I get a closer shave using a downward pass, followed by an upward pass than I ever did with the cartridges - and it&#x27;s a ton cheaper in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this brand before in small quantities but have barely got into this bulk pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I&#x27;ve only used a couple of blades and already I&#x27;m finding dull ones right out of the package, like J. L. Arinello&#x27;s 2011 review says.  Like I said, I had tried these blades in a sampler pack, so I&#x27;m wondering if the best quality blades go towards the small quantity packs, and the lower quality go into the bulk packs?  Or maybe the quality control is just plain inconsistent or nonexistant.  I&#x27;m lowering my star rating to 3 stars after finding a couple dull ones.  I&#x27;ll update again if my experience with these changes.  Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t start using these right away when they came and I&#x27;m now past the return deadline. :(</li>
    <li> These are not well made at all. They may appear to be just as good as the competitors but try it and you will most likely agree that you wasted your money. I bought some to try them out and would use them once in awhile because I felt that I was wasting money if I didn&#x27;t use them. This morning I decided enough was enough. Halfway through my shave I threw the razor away along with all of the other ones that I had left that were unopened. I slipped in a new blade from a different company and it was amazing how different it felt.</li>
    <li> Enough for a lifetime.</li>
    <li> I tried one of these blades out in my Merkur slant bar razor. It was horrible. With every other brand of blade that I&#x27;ve tried, my shaves feel smooth, but this one felt rough. I noticed that the blade seemed to drag too. You&#x27;re probably better of with the Astra Super Platinum blades and they are less money.</li>
    <li> Could not be more pleased with this item.  Based my purchase off of a review and it was spot on!!!</li>
    <li> When I first learned about the joys of shaving on Amazon, I read a great review, I think at the Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor page.  There is some great information on Amazon about how  to ditch Gillette and begin the lost art of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These 7:00 a.m. blades were recommended because they are not too sharp, and they cause less bleeding.  I tried the real sharp blades, and bled, and I tried these blades, and very rarely have a nick, and even then, it is my fault for being in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are great blades to keep from cutting yourself, while still giving a great shave. I don&#x27;t have a beard or hair like wires, so some people might need a sharper blade.  At your own peril.</li>
    <li> I switched to a DE Razor and tried multiple different blades. I have a very course beard with sensitive skin. This blade keeps it&#x27;s sharpness for me for 3 shaves. The blade is just sharp enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are new to the DE Razor, try different blades until you find the right one for you. It is worth it to find that perfect shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These blades were shipped on time. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> If you are looking to save a lot of money and get the best shave this is the razor blades you may want to buy. Got this with the Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor and I will never buy another Mach 3 razor. I had my doubt that this would be a mess since I have very sensitive skin, but it actually made my shave much better and no mess. And after 2-3 shaves you will feel like a pro. And the best benefit is the money you will save. I tried other blades but this one is the best so far.</li>
    <li> Look...blades are a very personal thing. How they work will depend on your razor, how you hold it, your skin and your beard. Look at reviews for all double-edge blades: half will love them, the other half will hate them. I&#x27;ve tried lots of blades, including expensive Feather and Merkur blades, Astra, Gillette, you name it. The best blades FOR ME were these 7am blades. I don&#x27;t care where the blades are made. It&#x27;s not rocket science. And if you think blades made my Merkur in Germany are higher quality...well, enjoy the hype. (And for what it&#x27;s worth: I&#x27;m German!!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: the best blades I&#x27;ve found for my use. The fact that they are cheap is an added bonus. I didn&#x27;t select them because they are cheap, but because they are good. I only found out afterwards that they are inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Great blades. Not the sharpest I&#x27;ve used, but for the price they are amazing. Highly recommended, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> I wish my wife did not buy me TWO packages of 100  7a.m. blades.  Very disappointed!  Not sure how to go about&lt;br /&gt;returning second 100-package.  The first few blades I got a great shave.  Since then, I am lucky to get two shaves from each blade; throw out after one shave.  I&#x27;m a retired tool maker and notice that 1 out of 5 blades from each pack are okay; the others visibly inferior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now use the Gillette Platinum.  Excellent quality-very consistent.  No nicks or razor burn.  Very happy with these Russian made blades.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these with a Merkur 38C for a few months now. They get the job done and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> I loved the packaging of the razors, and I&#x27;ve never purchased any other type of blade. So by comparison I couldn&#x27;t really be the best judge. I liked the product overall and would by again.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I have tried my share of blades and this is the only blade that I was unable to complete a shave.  I thought that I may have gotten a bad blade on first use.  I reloaded with a fresh blade and the results were the same.  I tied the remaining blades on a weekend when I made sure my prep was flawless with the same results.  Blades are very subjective so you may find these work for you.  For me these are consistantly poor shaving blades.  There are better and cheaper choices out there.</li>
    <li> Great deal. My husband loves these and has had them for months and still has a ton left.</li>
    <li> I wish I would have bought a 5-Pack instead first. They get the job done, but are not nearly as sharp as a Merkur or Astra blade. I traded a buddy one of these for one of his Astra&#x27;s, and we both came to the same conclusion. Which is sad, because now I have 100 of these to go through.</li>
    <li> They last about 5-7 days for me. First blades tried with my Murker 180 Double Edge razor. Will try the Feather blades next.</li>
    <li> These razors are as sharp as any other brands I&#x27;ve tried and last for quite a few shaves before needing replaced. For less than $20 I have enough to last all year.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t pay close enough attention and mistook these for Gillette 7:00&#x27;s (which I regard as a fairly good blade).  The packaging is labeled \\&quot;Technical collaboration from Switzerland\\&quot; and \\&quot;Swiss quality,\\&quot; but I believe these blades are made in Bangaladesh. These blades are unacceptable to me, not even good for 1 shave. Since I opened the pack, I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s right to return them to Amazon (it&#x27;s not their fault the blades suck). I&#x27;m just chalking this purchase up as a waste of $17.</li>
    <li> 4 Month Review -After switching from Mach III razors&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below is the listed product I am using as part of my &amp;#34;Shaving Arsenal.&amp;#34; It took me a while to find each piece needed to bring it all together. My approach was finding all the pieces that had the best reviews vs. price. Just about everything listed below was the &amp;#34;highest price&amp;#34; but luckily these items don&#x27;t cost much. Not CLOSE to as much as it costs to shave with Mach III Safety razors. If your ready to make the switch to a superior, and cheaper, alternative then check out the products below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blades: 7a.m. Platinum Double Edge Safety Razor Blades&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve heard there are better blades on the Market but since I started out with a 100-pack it will be 2-YEARS until I need to buy any more since I change them out once a week. I&#x27;m half Filipino so I don&#x27;t have the thickest facial hair but definably pull off a goatee without a problem.  Other than one &amp;#34;Dud&amp;#34; all other blades have been very predictable and easy to use. I have gotten the occasional razor burn but that appears to be normal with any Double-edged razor. I was worried I would be opening myself up to more &amp;#34;risk&amp;#34; with these but feel that I am at no more risk than any other safety blade now that I am used to it.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017ZECA6/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_32&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Shave: Virgin Island Bay Rum by Clubman&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tested several types of Aftershave in stores but never found anything I liked. Based on reviews I had a hunch I would really like this. Once it arrived I was right! It gives me a very fresh feeling after my morning shave, and has an amazing smell which isn&#x27;t overpowering at all. My wife is very sensitive to smells but this is one she actually admires.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000053L6W/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_2&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Handle: Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor.&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed about this handle is the quality. You can tell its not your basic cheap piece of metal. Its got a comfortable weight to it, keeps its brilliant chrome finish, and clean up is quick and easy. I consider myself a man with normal size hands  and don&#x27;t know why this one is considered &amp;#34;long handled.&amp;#34; Its just a tad longer than the Mach III razor I used to use. However, it’s a night and day difference compared to those &amp;#34;Safety razors.&amp;#34; It cuts very close with minimal passes. I&#x27;ve never had a shave that was this close before.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Merkur-Model-180-Handled-Safety/dp/B000NL0T1G/ref&#x3D;sr_1_10?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1355613524&amp;sr&#x3D;8-10&amp;keywords&#x3D;double+edge+razor+handle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stand: Safety Razor stand&lt;br /&gt; Once I learned that a stand was needed for the &amp;#34;Tweezerman Men&#x27;s Shaving Brush&amp;#34; I decided to go with this one. Its been 4 months and the chrome is still shining well. Its sturdy, and holds my double edged razor as well as the shaving brush as if this product was made just for them. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001XURHNY/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_42&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brush: Not sure why its made of &amp;#34;Badger&amp;#34; hair but its working. Where this brush looses a star is because it lost some of its bristles during the first week. Since then there haven&#x27;t been any more hair-loss and I&#x27;ve had no problems. 4 months going strong. It creates a nice lather and feels good against the skin. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G647Y8/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_47&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving Soap: Prosaro Shaving Soap&lt;br /&gt;It works but I with it had more lather. Based on previous reviews, it sounds like the amount of lather has significantly decreased. Does it work? Yes, but I like a good lather. Anyways, its been 3 months and I feel like I have maybe gone through half of this container which isn&#x27;t bad. It also has a very fresh but subtle smell which I really like.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00837YY18/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_44?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;redirect&#x3D;true&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soap Bowl: Guess I didn&#x27;t need this since I am using the Proraso Shaving Soap which is self contained. For as simple as it is, it lost two stars. There is a rim that goes along the bottom that has (or had) a black rubber piece that ran around it to provide a good footing for the Bowl while on a counter. The very first day this part fell off, it didn’t seat on there, and it wasn&#x27;t glued. In the garbage that piece went. The next star was lost due to finish.

    <li> My first safety razor and blades.  I never realized how terrible disposable razors are until I switched to these.  They&#x27;re much sharper than on a disposable razor, so I don&#x27;t nick myself nearly as often (a sharper blade &#x3D; less drag &#x3D; fewer cuts.)  I change the blade every Saturday.  I could probably get a few more shaves out of each blade, but I love the feel of a fresh blade.  I also like the sense of environmental responsibility when I&#x27;m only tossing out a small blade instead of a whole razor.</li>
    <li> I completely regret purchasing these blades, and will probably end up throwing them away.  I bought a 35 pack of a variety of blades, and found them to be far superior.  I couldn&#x27;t get through a full three-pass shave without applying more pressure to the razor than with which I felt comfortable.  I posted my review on the othe 35 razors in another post, but found the Feather&#x27;s to be the best blades of all the brands I&#x27;ve tried, and Astra&#x27;s to be a pretty close second (and, they&#x27;re about a quarter the price of Feather).</li>
    <li> I ordered these blades for my husband&#x27;s Merkur razor, and they work great for him. Smooth, easy shave and the blades last well. What a great value at 15 cents a piece. Excellent!</li>
    <li> I shave every other day and 1 blade lasts for about 2 weeks for me.&lt;br /&gt;I believe that is fair enough and still very economical when it comes&lt;br /&gt;to shaving. Some people in reviews have mentioned that they dont last&lt;br /&gt;too long but you can&#x27;t beat the price even if they don&#x27;t last too long for you.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend them.</li>
    <li> First of all these razors give no closer a shave than a disposable razor! They dull quickly though this may not be saying much given the previous sentence. And, most troubling, they rust - and quickly: within the first 24 hr after using it! I prefer Merkur razors which, though more expensive, give an incredibly close shave - as in I don&#x27;t need to shave for two days - last a long time before becoming dull, and do not rust.</li>
    <li> I love these blades but use what works best for you. Buy samplers and try a bunch of blades before committing to a 100 pack. I get 2 shaves out of my blades before tossing them, found that works best for me.</li>
    <li> These blades were a part of my first venture into DE shaving and from other reviews it would seem that is the case with a lot of people.  Unfortunately, while these blades are cheap, you get what you pay for.  I&#x27;ve found that the quality from blade to blade can vary widely.  Some of the blades come right out of the package with a slightly jagged edge.  Generally I can only get a shave or two before I feel they are too dull to use, often less.  I&#x27;ve since moved on to Derby blades which I feel are much better suited to a beginner.  The quality of Derby is consistent and they are still forgiving enough for someone still learning.  If I had it to do over again, I&#x27;d probably start with a variety pack which included a few Derby blades.  Now, what to do with all the 7am blades I have left?  Pass on these.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m astonished that I can buy a 2-year supply of these for only $15.00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave is just wonderful, and the value absolutely can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> changed my shaving life!  Great product and value.</li>
    <li> These are great blades for the price. I swap them out 2-3 times a week and don&#x27;t care because they are so cheaply replaced. Awesome product.</li>
    <li> Since I started using these I have hade some of the closest shaves ever. They seem to dull a bit faster but I think that is becasue they are so sharp to start and naturally dull with use against the hair of the beard. Still love them.</li>
    <li> I have been using double edged razors almost as long as I have been shaving, and these blades are the worst.  I don&#x27;t have the most rugged beard of all time, but even the faintest of whiskers jammed on these things, causing the razor to jump and bite into my face.  I went to work looking like I dipped my face in a wood-chipper.  Seriously, I would rather break an old beer bottle and shave with shards of broken glass than buy another of these.</li>
    <li> A year supply for 15 bucks, and a great shave at that.  I felt that it was very good quality.</li>
    <li> I bought a pack of 100 blades when I first started with wet-shaving but my experience was terrible. However, at the time, I did not know that safety razor blades work differently for each individual&#x27;s skin type. Some others have worked very well for me and some did alright. 7a.m. blades absolutely sucked!! First shave is mediocre quality and second shave is terrible. Also, the edges is not that great so I ended up using more pressure on the handle that ruins your technique and nicks the face a lot more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now being a wet-shaver for almost an year, I can say these blades don&#x27;t have the greatest reputation in wet-shaver community. But again, it may work for you. I suggest trying a smaller pack to begin with if you are not sure.</li>
