      <li>It is very strong and clean scented.</li>
      <li>The original is even better but is it 20 times better?  </li>
      <li>The actual roller is very good as well.</li>
      <li>Long ago I tried the real Aventus and honestly wasn&#x27;t really impressed.</li>
      <li>This is my first review of any kind on any product on Amazon.</li>
      <li>quick shipping also!</li>

      <li>Before I forget, AMAZING FAST SHIPPING....</li>
      <li>Start light and work your way up.</li>
      <li>Honestly, one woman that was a stranger who asked me what I was wearing had a look of lust in her eyes when she explained how much she liked the smell of real Aventus.</li>
      <li>I have not smelled the original fragrance</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t smelled the original, but have heard rave reviews about it.</li>
      <li>Never smelled the original, so I can&#x27;t compare.  </li>
      <li>I have to give Serina a huge shout out for doing her best to duplicate these original complex fragrances.</li>
      <li>Great compromise instead of buying the real thing lasts super long although I do have to say that I miss being able to smell it on my shirts even after putting them through the wash.</li>
      <li>First time buyer I purchased Pure havane and Aventus and i must say i am definitely loving both</li>
      <li>This is a good try at mimicking Aventus, but you can tell the quality of ingredients isn&#x27;t the same.  </li>
      <li>The originals are better than her creation, but again lets be real some of the creed’s also have spotty longevity.</li>
      <li>Smells ok, fast shipping.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really not a bad scent, but it isn&#x27;t Aventus.  </li>
      <li>I mean PERFECT!</li>
      <li>Much love from New York City!</li>
      <li>This product was delivered extremely quickly.</li>
      <li>My new favorite.</li>
      <li>Had high hopes!!!</li>
      <li>I will definitely be ordering more!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smells ok, fast shipping. Will try other fragances to see if they have better quality and stronger fragrance. I like it so far, although not my favorite.</li>
    <li> smells good. Not sure how close this rendition is to the original, but very enjoyable scent. For the value, these are a must try</li>
    <li> First time buyer I purchased Pure havane and Aventus and i must say i am definitely loving both not only are they spot on in note but they project strong with amazing longevity. The BOMB!</li>
    <li> If you pay $5 for a product that sells for $300, you cannot realistically expect the same quality.</li>
    <li> I purchased this fragrance for my husband. It arrived today and before I even opened the bottle I could smell it. It is very strong and clean scented. I have not smelled the original fragrance so I cant compare the two but I will say this is a really great scent either way. I mean for 4.99! shoot! It smells really expensive and last a long time! Cant beat that</li>
    <li> I love this. It&#x27;s not Aventus, but man it smells amazing. It same some of the same notes. I have just ordered another roll on tube of it. I will be wearing this a lot. The problem for me is the quality of the bottle. The oil leaks if it&#x27;s not sitting upright. But not too badly.  All in all, 9/10. I will recommend this and I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing! need a larger roll on bottle</li>
    <li> I have to give Serina a huge shout out for doing her best to duplicate these original complex fragrances. She has done a splendid job. The originals are better than her creation, but again lets be real some of the creed’s also have spotty longevity. I would never review fragrances, but I would feel guilty I did not do reviews for these ones, so here is 2 cents’ I have over 75 bottles, from all the niche to designers, so I know what I am saying, but again take my advice or leave it. Before I forget, AMAZING FAST SHIPPING....&lt;br /&gt;Creed aventus- this bad boy was the best according to me. It is very close to the original. it has good longevity also..</li>
    <li> Never smelled the original, so I can&#x27;t compare.  I can say that I love this fragrance. My new favorite. Awesome.</li>
    <li> This is very close to the real deal! I love the scent. Thank you for making an awesome product!</li>
    <li> I own Creed Aventus and they are worlds apart. not saying this is a bad fragrance but should not be considered as an alternative i have seen much better imitations off Creed fragrances , this is not one. Great customer service from seller tho.</li>
    <li> Great value and great service. I have never smelled the OG but I can say that this stuff was a pleasant surprise. I want to try the terre d&#x27;hermes next...</li>
    <li> Still a bit pricey but not as expensive as the original.  The original is even better but is it 20 times better?  hard to say.  If it was an exact match it would have been 5 stars!!!!!</li>
    <li> Amazing! Smells so good! My husband loves it and I love it on him. Very good quality and last long!</li>
    <li> Really not even close to the name brand, have the right now on my wrists for comparison and there is none. This oil basically smells like flowery grass. Had high hopes!!!</li>
    <li> First, let me say that Creed colognes are criminally overpriced.  Paying $300+ for a 4 oz bottle of cologne might seem absurd to most people.  However, you really do get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wore both Creed Aventus and this body oil side by side.  I liked the Creed better.  It has a certain sophistication...a certain \\&quot;fruity wood\\&quot; that smells absolutely delicious.  The body oil smells too generic.  Are they similar?  Yes, but there is a difference.</li>
    <li> This oil goes on as a very sweet fruity scent but as your body temperature rises, it changes to a very strong pungent Musky scent. It can be a very overwhelming scent if applied to heavily. Start light and work your way up.</li>
    <li> I have Creed Aventus and wear it when I go out. I did a side by side smell comparison between these two and the Creed just has a little more of smokey pineapple tint to it. This stuff is good and provides the strong pine and smokey smell that Creed does. When you put it on initially your room will be full of the scent similar to how Creed does and I do love that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ultimate test will be is if I get any comments from the ladies on this. I will include that in my updated review after I give it a few goes this summer.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!</li>
    <li> This oil has got me more compliments than any cologne I have ever worn!!! no joke! So I felt it deserved the comment! It also lasts a very long time!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t smelled the original, but have heard rave reviews about it. I don&#x27;t want to fork out massive amounts of money just for a cologne, so I bought this. As soon as I put it on, my wife went crazy and couldn&#x27;t stop sniffing me. All the notes are there (pineapple, apple, etc...) in this heavenly scent.</li>
    <li> Smells ok. But not even close to comparable with creed aventus.</li>
    <li> Smells identical! I don&#x27;t know how you did it but I&#x27;m glad you did! I immediately tested it in on my skin. ONE SINGLE DAB &amp; the sillage is identical to a 400.00 bottle. For a cologne connoisseur w/ a hypersensitive nose let me tell you that you have a gift! Fast Shipping as well. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This smells nothing like Aventus, that being said, its still a decent product. But if your looking for Aventus you&#x27;ll be let down. Basically it smells similar to the pineapple note in Aventus minus the smoke. Given that the smoke note is what adds Masculinity to this fragrance i find it too fruity to personally wear, that being said, a female friend of mine loved it, but not on a man.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;To borrow from A Tribe Called Quest, \\&quot;Serina (Applebum), I gotta put this on. Serina (Applebum), I said I gotta put this on!\\&quot; The previous reviews were right, this Creed Aventus is SLAMMIN&#x27;! I only learned of Creed a little over a year ago, so while I am novice to the entire collection, I am an expert to what makes me smile, and Serina has introduced another reason to. Yes, YOU GO, GIRL! \\&quot;</li>
    <li> I typically don&#x27;t leave reviews because I&#x27;m lazy but I had to for this oil. This is one of the best oils I have ever had, EVER! I will definitely be ordering more!</li>
    <li> A+ seller. EXTREMELY fast delivery, great communication &amp; customer service. Everything was very well wrapped &amp; exactly as described. The fragrances can&#x27;t be beat. They are long lastly &amp; spot on with the originals! I will definitely be a repeat customer &amp; if you&#x27;re on the fence about making a purchase from Serina&#x27;s Bow Tiq I promise you won&#x27;t be disappointed. Thanks Serina! Much love from New York City!</li>
    <li> It was just alright...</li>
    <li> Man o man. The best and wonderful smell. It is amazing and very nice smell not over powering at all like typical body oils. Apply it in the morning and wonderful smell will be with you all day. It is that good and long lasting.I was hesitant to buy first but then opted to give it a try. I also bought Creed Irish Tweed and Creed Imperial. Am I happy with my purchase? Absolutely. I generally do not right reviews but this one give me a reason to write so that others who are looking for good fragrances can buy it with confidence.</li>
    <li> I bought this oil for my son and he immediately rolled some on. He and I are very pleased with this selection.  Thank you so much for a great product and speedy delivery.</li>
    <li> This is my first review of any kind on any product on Amazon. I was a bit skeptical about buying an oil at this price which was supposed to \\&quot;mimic\\&quot; a niche fragrance only fit for kings ands queens. But I did it; and boy am I glad! Ive ordered the Millesime Imperial, Aventus, Green Irish Tweed, and Virgin Island water types and they are ALL so on point from initial roll-on to dry down, I cant tell the difference between this and the real thing...Only these oils last a lot longer...and my money goes a lot farther! I dont know how Serena&#x27;s Bow Tiq manages to get these right. From the pineapple and apple top notes to that masculine cigar, smokey mid note that comes out of Aventus...its here in the oil. I mean PERFECT! I&#x27;ll even go a step further and say that not all Aventus batches are alike, and some are even down right yucky. But THIS product is spot on! I am now a dedicated customer. OBTW...I get compliments on this daily! Expect more business!!</li>
    <li> I got this because of the reviews I read and it has a very strong, long lasting scent that is very sexy in my opinion. I guess I&#x27;ll be buying the bottle and it arrived overseas within 5 days so thank you.</li>
    <li> This Aventus last all day and the ladies love it. I was told that this should be called \\&quot;I&#x27;m gonna eat you up\\&quot; instead of Aventus. Enough said!!</li>
    <li> i looove this amell its the best smell out there.the delivery was on time the smell was 5 star!ive done oder 8 different kinds of smells from me and they all was amazing and on point!i will continue shopping with serina.</li>
    <li> I need more of this, great smell, my son loved it..you will want more so buy more than one. muah</li>
    <li> smells good for 30-40mins,</li>
    <li> This is a good try at mimicking Aventus, but you can tell the quality of ingredients isn&#x27;t the same.  The burst of fresh pineapple against the smokey birchwood is what drives everyone crazy about Aventus.  Here the pineapple is very synthetic smelling, very sharp to the nose.  The smoke seems to be recreated by means of a patchouli type scent, which doesn&#x27;t really work.  It&#x27;s really not a bad scent, but it isn&#x27;t Aventus.  I&#x27;m not knocking the product, but I don&#x27;t want people reading all these ridiculous reviews that say it&#x27;s the exact same and being disappointed.</li>
    <li> I saw reviews on this and decided to use my brother as the guinea pig, he loves it and the women around him do too lol! Fraction of the price, all the glory! Zing! Sticking it to the man!</li>
    <li> This oil is amazing. Long ago I tried the real Aventus and honestly wasn&#x27;t really impressed. I walked away saying to myself why would anyone pay $180 for a bottle of this stuff. However this oil is amazing. It is everything I have been looking for. The quality is amazing and the scent is also very very nice. The actual roller is very good as well. I will be suggesting this too many people so please keep making great scents. The price is also very very good. You cant go wrong with this oil.</li>
    <li> Compliments all night long</li>
    <li> Great compromise instead of buying the real thing lasts super long although I do have to say that I miss being able to smell it on my shirts even after putting them through the wash. That&#x27;s the only downside. Also, for the Aventus specifically, it&#x27;s missing the leathery smell when you initially put it on, but the scent in general is spot on.</li>
    <li> The best oil I have ever purchased online and off the street from a vendor. I have gotten some many compliments from all the oil&#x27;s I have purchased from this buyer.</li>
    <li> I do like this stuff, people say it smells sexy and I don&#x27;t overuse it at all... the only problem I have is that this is the same cologne that every cologne wearing guy seems to throw on, so i&#x27;ll walk into a bar and 20 other dudes smell just like me hahaha and even though i&#x27;ve never had a complaint I just feel grouped with the douche-esque dudes you smell from 50 yds away. I only use it when im dressing really sharp for a high-minded, classy occasion.</li>
    <li> One of the reviews here say that, yeah, it&#x27;s a bit less fruity, but In my opinion, this scent finishes off better with the base/low notes, making this feel better to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lasts a crazy crazy long time, after all it IS oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is really high quality and made of glass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, It would be ridiculous to compare it to the real thing, but it stands up well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5$ vs $300+&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will be buying more as soon as I run out.</li>
    <li> I bought hree from Serina \\&quot;creed aventus; tobacco vanille; New Haarlem and all three smelled great and just like the original. I will buy from her again!</li>
    <li> Its great and I&#x27;m coming back for more when I run out. Great job on this fragrance. Good staying power.</li>
    <li> This product was delivered extremely quickly. Smells spectacular! Loads of compliments from my friends and co-workers. And need I say how affordable it was. Keep it up!</li>
    <li> Lasts quite a while..smells like the real thing..highly recommended. If you want to try before you buy then you should pick this up.</li>
    <li> Excellent perfume.  Very fresh and pleasant.  Attractive and sexy smell.  Stays on All day long, does not evaporate like alcohol based perfumes.</li>
    <li> Excellent Shipping ! took 3 days to get to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this stuff smells so amazing i&#x27;m gonna go try it on some ladies soon. even if it&#x27;s a knock off it smells so amazing ! thanks</li>
    <li> Smelled good and perfect price.  Just wish had a bigger bottle.  My husband really liked it and said he gets a lot of compliments on it.</li>
    <li> smells close enough for me for the price.  I love oils.  I will buy again.  I bought two and gave one to a friend and he loves it as well.</li>
    <li> I purchased this in hopes that it would be a similar representation of the real fragrance. Needless to say I was not disappointed. Even my friends are asking what it is and how can they get some! Gonna buy a couple more bottles for the homies!</li>
    <li> I have been using Creed Aventus for a year. I love it but it is rather pricey. I can&#x27;t belive how close this oil is to the fragrance. I use a little oil then a little spray of my fragrance for more lasting power. Will buy more soon.</li>
    <li> yes, it is a little strong, but nothing that you can&#x27;t handle by putting it on at the right time...say, 15 or so minutes before you&#x27;re going to wherever. the ladies absolutely love how it smells. give some lady a hug after trying this on, and see her reaction. i am halfway done, and will be ordering more. quick shipping also! thank you!</li>
    <li> After reading all of the reviews of this Creed Aventus type oil I had high hopes. It is now obvious that the reviews were written by people that were getting paid or there are a lot of people that just can not distinguish smells. This does not smell like Aventus at all. However, it does smell like Aventus type oil that is distributed by Hayward Enterprises. Guess I shouldn&#x27;t be supprised by that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I almost gave it a 1 star because I will not wear it. I had to remember that it was the reviews that said it smelled just like Aventus. I am starting to think that fragrance oil types are made by one company and just sold by companies under different names. If you do not have Aventus and you are not familiar with it&#x27;s smell then this product might fool you. It also will not smell any different in Alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish someone could replicate Aventus. Paying that much for fragrances is crazy so the bottle I have doesn&#x27;t get used as much as I would like. Aventus almost gives me a chubby when I wear it and I have gotten compliments on it from women that get close enough to smell it. Honestly, one woman that was a stranger who asked me what I was wearing had a look of lust in her eyes when she explained how much she liked the smell of real Aventus. I told her I had a sample I was trying and she said I should by it for sure. That being said, I dboubt this oil from Sirena&#x27;s would get the same reaction from anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate writing negative reviews but people need to have an impartial review on here for this product. If you like the smell of Aventus then don&#x27;t bother getting this Creed Aventus Type oil. If you do you will be disappointed.</li>
