### Positive Reviews

      <li>THis makeup is AWESOME.  </li>
      <li>Best makeup.</li>
      <li>But I will say that my skin looks closer to perfect than ever before.</li>
      <li>and it didn&#x27;t break me out at all which is awesome</li>
      <li>However, I did not get the flawless looking skin results that were shown on the tv models.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never had the perfect airbrushed-skin-of a- supermodel-in-a-magazine look,</li>
      <li>She had ordered off of tv shopping show and was very happy with it.</li>
      <li>This started kit allowed me to sample which color may be best.</li>
      <li>This make-up is the best of the mineral make-ups.</li>
      <li>This is the best makeup ever.</li>
      <li>Follow the dvd directions for the best application.</li>
      <li>The brushes are excellent and seem to make all the difference.</li>
      <li>My skin looks great and by mixing the two shades, I have the perfect color.</li>
      <li>It leaves a great finish to any complexion - if you are not acheiving great results - you need to practice your technique.</li>
      <li>The Mineral Veil is a perfect perfector for any foundation you choose to wear it kind of blurs your imperfections.</li>
      <li>Great brushes -</li>
      <li>so it was nice for the time it lasted but the best part were the brushes.</li>
      <li>Basics\\&quot; (great, also), a blush compatible, an eyebrow kit, and also a retro eyeliner kit.  </li>
      <li>I noticed my niece&#x27;s complexion was looking very nice tonight</li>
      <li>I feel good when I go out knowing that people arent looking at my blemishes, but looking at how beautiful my face is.</li>
      <li>I would never spend this kind of money on this line of makeup again!</li>
      <li>it is a good thing not to tug on my face applying the tranditional foundation.</li>
      <li>This make up gives me an even tone and the warmth works great for a nice sunkissed glow.  </li>
      <li>This kit really is a good deal because it provides everything you need.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
      <li>I loved the coverage</li>
      <li>However, I absolutely LOVED the Mineral Veil and the brushes.</li>
      <li>Blends good, and covers what you want.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with the color choices and will know more when summer comes.</li>
      <li>The brushes alone are worth the cost of the kit and work wonderfully.  </li>
      <li>She looks naturally adorable now!</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this stuff!</li>
      <li>and I love it!</li>
      <li>This product sounds better than it performs!  </li>
      <li>Regardless of how many layers I attempted to put on!</li>
      <li>I have great skin &amp; thats why I wanted this for some light coverage.</li>
      <li>The brushes that come with this are amazing.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m thrilled.</li>
      <li>No matter, I liked the makeup and will continue to use it.</li>
      <li>I am truly hooked now and am really catching on to all the benefits of these mineral products.  </li>
      <li>and I will think of ordering her, her own set.</li>
      <li>It goes on quick, easy, and flawless.</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t love a makeup more!</li>
      <li>The brushes are the best to use, they so soft on my face.</li>
      <li>I tried it after hearing people at work talk about how much they loved it!</li>
      <li>Bare Escentuals I.D. is already well known as an excellent makeup line and has many suppliers.</li>
      <li>For me this powder goes on quickly with a good brush.  </li>
      <li>How much better can you get than that?  </li>
      <li>I HAVE TRIED MANY OTHERS, BUT</li>
      <li>The make up itself was okay</li>
      <li>Everything you need to \\&quot;get started\\&quot; with this delightfully light as air feeling look ..... fresh and unscented ..... great.</li>
      <li>thought of sharing this with my daughter because I was so sure it wasnt going to work for me.</li>
      <li>and I like liquid coverage better.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>I now buy most of my be products on ebay.com</li>
      <li>on this was more like days not weeks.</li>
      <li>Perhaps finer holes would be better.</li>
      <li>Reason being, at 58, I wasn&#x27;t sure it would not enhance my wrinkles instead of my skin.  </li>
      <li>I am glad I decided to give it a try.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>You get moderate coverage at best.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have to worry about blemishes on my skin because of products with so many chemicals, etc.</li>
      <li>And, for sure, I will be re-ordering.</li>
      <li>I love this product...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I did.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
      <li>It covers up better than any cream or wand concealor and</li>
      <li>It gives a clean, flawless finish that looks natural and lasts all day.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased the product from Amazon, but I would never pay the full price for it for myself, as it didn&#x27;t quite perform the way I would have liked.</li>
      <li>The brush that you use the most could be of better quality, the bristles seem to fall out easily.</li>
      <li>Bottom line, this product is great for those who want to put something healthy on their skin, and/or in the process of trying to achieve clear skin.</li>
      <li>I do tan easily so it will be interesting to see summer results.</li>
      <li>Best of all, the thank you gift they sent actually had some value--a mini-sized version of BareEscentuals Light foundation.</li>
      <li>think most people will be happy with this; as for those of us who are a bit more sensitive, we&#x27;ll have to keep looking, and save this for special occasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
      <li>I have had better success with name brand mineral makeups from drug stores!</li>
      <li>I have been trying to find a foundation that would be easy to apply, cover up problem areas, and have an SPF.</li>
      <li>It is easy to use, the color was correct (I bought medium), and it does hide blemishes and acne.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s easy.</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>and I strongly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Bare Minerals provides great coverage</li>
      <li>I was nervous to try a new make up, but borrowed a friends one day and loved it.</li>
      <li>After two years of mineral wear use I realize Bare Minerals has the most wonderful brushes and are worth every penny, however, I would say that sticking to the drugstore mineral wear works just as well for a much cheaper price.</li>
      <li>It is so natural looking, covers flaws so wonderfully &amp; is all natural to boot!  </li>
      <li>you cant put on in the car and drive at the same time, you need both hands, lol. &lt;</li>
      <li>Even after my sister got it for her birthday last year, I still wasn&#x27;t convinced it was so great.  </li>
      <li>In fact, when I returned the product the company admitted that it doesn&#x27;t work for women of color (something about the spf in the product reflecting light and making us look ashy).</li>
      <li>I purchased this product and I am amazed at how light it feels on my skin and how radiant it makes my face look throughout the day.  </li>
      <li>When it comes to using \\&quot;warmth\\&quot; on lighter skin tones, you won&#x27;t be able to apply it to your whole face, but if applied lightly it still looks great and natural as a blush.</li>
      <li>I had seen one of my customers one day who really looked nice</li>
      <li>I do want to buy more of the foundation primer because I feel it really did help set the make-up and gave it better coverage.  </li>
      <li>Natural doesn&#x27;t automatically mena good</li>
      <li>This set is good for those days when I feel I need a bit more makeup: the foundation gives pretty good coverage (especially if you use the kabuki brush), Warmth gives the perfect glow on my cheeks and mineral veil is fab to achieve that finished look which I never felt I could achieve, no matter how much or how little makeup I put on and</li>
      <li>For the most part, it&#x27;s easy to use and does indeed give the face a more natural look without any heaviness.  </li>
      <li>(if you already have decent skin) I liked the feel of it</li>
      <li>This product is so fun to use!  </li>
      <li>She said she went to a job interview,... and said she wore Bare Escentuals and loved it.</li>
      <li>it is sooo worth it!</li>
      <li>Overall good product just make sure you get the right color</li>
      <li>I look as if I have taken ten years off my life and my skin has a nice healthy glow.</li>
      <li>For first time users flawless application could be a little tricky.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my mid twenties, so I was hoping for a natural foundation for slightly oily skins with some problem areas. I felt the coverage was not good and it&#x27;s very time consuming. I have friends that rave over this product, but it just isnt for me.</li>
    <li> first off the shipping was super FAST! on this was more like days not weeks. A very big plus for me as I sell on line daily so shipping to me is important. So 5 stars on the shipping! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have not worn make-up with any regularity for about 30 yrs. I tried it here and there and did not like the feeling or the look. I tried high end department store products to low end make-up from drug store. Nothing seemed right. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I really tried this product on a whim. I had seen one of my customers one day who really looked nice and I told her. She said she went to a job interview,... and said she wore Bare Escentuals and loved it. She had ordered off of tv shopping show and was very happy with it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I thought why not, so I ordered it. It did take me a few days to get the hang of working the powder and the brushes. It does cover up the ruddy-red that comes with age. I am suprised that as the day wears on, my face feels the same as if I had no make up on. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;That is what I like, I do not look made up. It doesnt come off on the phone like other make-up tends to do. I still dont wear eye make up but I do use some of the Bare Esc. eye powder that is a dark grey under my eyebrows, just to open up my eyes some, as I wear glasses, too. &lt;br /&gt;I am happy with the color choices and will know more when summer comes. I do tan easily so it will be interesting to see summer results. &lt;br /&gt;Why make-up now after going for almost 30 yrs without? &lt;br /&gt;To blend or cover the reddness and to even out color without it being heavy or made up. I even keep my fingers off of my face with this on. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I thought of sharing this with my daughter because I was so sure it wasnt going to work for me. But I kept it hidden from her and I will think of ordering her, her own set. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So all in all, it seems to work for me. Like I said it took a few days to get the hang of mastering the powder and brushes. I have had it for about two weeks and I am not onewho spends time in front of a mirror, so far I feel like I can get this product on without taking too much time. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I just know that this is one make-up you cant put on in the car and drive at the same time, you need both hands, lol. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> So I bought this because I always wanted to try it. After two years of mineral wear use I realize Bare Minerals has the most wonderful brushes and are worth every penny, however, I would say that sticking to the drugstore mineral wear works just as well for a much cheaper price. I&#x27;m a college student with a low budget so it was nice for the time it lasted but the best part were the brushes. If you&#x27;re a first time user I&#x27;d say go for it, it really works, but keep the brushes and get a MINERAL product from Jane or Maybelline after you run out, they work just as well because they&#x27;re all minerals &#x3D; ]</li>
    <li> Best makeup. Applies evenly, and does not look fake on skin. Blends good, and covers what you want.</li>
    <li> I have been using this makeup ever since I discovered it 2 years ago. It goes on quick, easy, and flawless. It doesnt seem to clog pores like all the other foundation makeup I have used in the past.  I absolutely love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I have been using this make up for about 2 years now and I love it! I tried it after hearing people at work talk about how much they loved it! And they were right. It takes a little get use to using it. I do have facial blemishes and they cover them very well. I have a pigment disorder around my eyes (this is were it is white and does not tan at all) this make up covers it up very well. I have tried other mineral makeup and did not like it at all. This make up feels like you have nothing on. About the only thing that I dont like is the price of it, but let me tell you it is so worth it. I feel good when I go out knowing that people arent looking at my blemishes, but looking at how beautiful my face is. I would recomend this to anyone. Give it a try you will not regret it!</li>
    <li> At first, I was hesitant to purchase foundation that was &#x27;powder-like&#x27; in fear that I would not receive full coverage; however, my curiousity with the product paid off!  I am extremely happy with the amount of coverage, and I looking forward to purchasing more Bare Escentuals in the future.</li>
    <li> I was very hesitant when I ordered this set. Reason being, at 58, I wasn&#x27;t sure it would not enhance my wrinkles instead of my skin.  I am glad I decided to give it a try. I&#x27;d definetly recommend that one orders the entire set, with the skin rev-er upper to prepare the face before applying the foundations.      I look as if I have taken ten years off my life and my skin has a nice healthy glow. I ordered the &#x27;medium&#x27; shade, and I think I might go lighter, one level, when I reorder.  And, for sure, I will be re-ordering. No more goopy liquid foundation for me, ever again. Free at last! I am even considering ordering the eye make up. The video that comes with it, shows it &#x27;very natural looking&#x27; and I am building a level of trust with the product.     One other thing...I noticed my niece&#x27;s complexion was looking very nice tonight and I took her aside and mentioned to her that I had ordered and was wearing bare essentials.  Not surprising, she told me that she had been using the same product and would never use anything else.      By the way, two foundations are included. I am using the lighter one of the two, but I am not going to waste the &#x27;darker shade&#x27; as I tried it out on my eyelids, and that worked out very nicely.</li>
    <li> My sister introduced me to bare essentials when she begin to use the product.  I am not a person who wears make up, but I thought that I did want to try.  I purchased this product and I am amazed at how light it feels on my skin and how radiant it makes my face look throughout the day.  I have sensitive skin and I do not have to worry about this make up causing irritations or causing blemishes.  Well done bare essentials!</li>
    <li> I really liked the Bare Minerals product. The coverage isn&#x27;t as good as the DVD shows, but it does cover and I don&#x27;t feel like I have heavy make-up on and it doesn&#x27;t look like I have heavy make-up on. I do want to buy more of the foundation primer because I feel it really did help set the make-up and gave it better coverage.  I think the only drawback is the price. It&#x27;s a little steep, but at the same time the coverage is good and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot of product at a time.</li>
    <li> This product makes women of color look ashy! I do not suggest it. In fact, when I returned the product the company admitted that it doesn&#x27;t work for women of color (something about the spf in the product reflecting light and making us look ashy). I was very upset to hear this especially after it was advertised as a product that would work well for everyone....I guess everyone with light/white skin.</li>
    <li> I really like this make up--but I have discovered that it takes me longer to get ready in the morning. THere are so many layers to put on--both on the face and the eyes, that I think I will revert back to the quicker and easier liquid foundation and creamy eye shadows I used before on work days. Also--the powder tapping makes a mess in your bathroom. But--I do like it and will use it.</li>
    <li> After seeing this product on TV, I decided to try it.  The foundation color I choose does match my skin tone well.  So, it makes it look natural.  The coverage is average at best, if you have any under eye discolorization you will need to use your regular concealer.  In my opinion, it feels just as heavy as liquid foundation and I like liquid coverage better.</li>
    <li> I bought Bare Essentials after two of my colleagues told me about the product and how much they liked it. I have been trying to find a foundation that would be easy to apply, cover up problem areas, and have an SPF. I bought the starter kit from Amazon because it came with the brushes, DVD, and mositurizer. The kit I saw on QVC was less expensive but didn&#x27;t have all the brushes or mositurizer. This kit really is a good deal because it provides everything you need. After watching the DVD I began to use the product. I really like it and am happy I bought Bare Essentials.It is easy to use, the color was correct (I bought medium), and it does hide blemishes and acne. It does take some time to get use to putting it on and getting the coverage you desire, but once you get the hang of it it&#x27;s easy. You use a small amount of the product so it should last awhile. It can be a bit messy if you aren&#x27;t careful, but I had much more trouble with an over the counter product that spilled all over the place. The brushes are excellent and seem to make all the difference. This product lived up to my expectations and I would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;VE HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS, DUE TO MY DELICATE SKIN I HAVE TRIED MANY OTHERS, BUT I IN PARTICULAR LIKE THIS BARE MINERALS, THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE EXPERIENCE, ITS ABOUT THE POWDER GETTING ON MY TOP GARMENTS, DON&#x27;T WANNA LEAVE HOME WITHOUT BRUSHING OFF THE LITTLE PARTICLES OUT OF MY SELF, BUT BESIDES THAT, CONTENTED WITH THE RESULTS, FEELS SO SMOOTH AND SO MUCH NATURAL!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I tried Bare Escentuals and I bought the med/medium beige started kit from Amazon.  It was so easy to apply and feels light like I am not wearing any makeup and looks so natural.  The brushes are the best to use, they so soft on my face. I love this product.</li>
    <li> This product sounds better than it performs!  It provides nominal coverage and does not last through the work day.  The mineral veil gives one a strange, alien glow not a natural glow.  It is very messy to use and keep!  I have had better success with name brand mineral makeups from drug stores!</li>
    <li> Ok so first off all, the people who say its cakey must be doing it wrong because when i do it (a teenager who NEVER wears make up for fear of massive breakouts) it looks fine...except for the color. I have olive skin and i got the med/tan color which looks different from the rest of my skin tone so you can totally tell I&#x27;m wearing make up. To combat this, i just apply the warmth down my neck and whatever is showing above my shirt collar. It covers pretty nicely and i have slept in it multiple times (which i don&#x27;t recommend cause it just feels weird when you wake up) and it doesn&#x27;t make you break out or anything. also it feels weird when you first put it on if you&#x27;ve never tried a product like this but its just like how normal make up would feel weird if you&#x27;d never worn it before.    Overall good product just make sure you get the right color haha.</li>
    <li> I have a hard time imagining that there&#x27;s another line of cosmetics out there that is this good for your skin. I recommend this product especially for those whom are prone to break outs or have sensitive skin. However, for people with acne or other dark spots to cover, even more so if you have light skin, it won&#x27;t be enough to give you the coverage you desire. I recommend purchasing Loreal&#x27;s mineral concealer, and using it as a pre-concealor. It covers up better than any cream or wand concealor and your still in the mineral make-up ballpark. Furthermore, I have never broken out  while using it.  The brush that you use the most could be of better quality, the bristles seem to fall out easily. When it comes to using \\&quot;warmth\\&quot; on lighter skin tones, you won&#x27;t be able to apply it to your whole face, but if applied lightly it still looks great and natural as a blush. For those with extremely light skin, the Light Starter kit might be too dark. I suggest going to a Sephora location and testing the shades that are included in the box. There is one shade lighter, but it is not sold in the Starter kit.   Bottom line, this product is great for those who want to put something healthy on their skin, and/or in the process of trying to achieve clear skin. And after applying correctly, you won&#x27;t get the appearance of wearing a lot of make-up, for a more natural look. I would recommend this to anyone, but suggest a mineral concealer for those who need heavy coverage in certain areas. Money well spent for good quality cosmetics.  As a side note, the BareVitamins skin rever-upper that the kit comes with might be irritating to sensitive skin. I had to adjust to it, but it might cause red irritation to some.</li>
    <li> This is a great makeup for anyone who wants a natural look with moderate coverage.  Let me start by saying that I have pretty clear skin and no wrinkles and use this makeup to even out skin tone and cover up any random blemishes that may pop up every now and again.      Pros:  *Very light - I really hate stuff on my face an am very sensitive to it, but I can&#x27;t feel this one.  *SPF 15 - I can&#x27;t use SPF face lotions bc they all make my face sticky, but this stuff has the SPF built in.  *Great brushes - The brushes alone are worth the cost of the kit and work wonderfully.  *Quick to put on - One you get the hang of it, it takes a few minutes to put it on.  *Looks natural - Doesn&#x27;t look like you are wearing makeup and blends right into hair line and sides of face without effort.  *Lasts all day!    Cons:  *Need practice - It took me about a week to get it right.  Also, you really need to make sure your face is \\&quot;dewey\\&quot; before you put it on or the makeup won&#x27;t stick.  *Can&#x27;t sleep in it - They claim you can \\&quot;sleep\\&quot; in this makeup, but if you do, expect to get it on your pillow.  It&#x27;s a powder, if you rub up against a fabric hard enough, it will come off.  *Moderate coverage - If you are looking for something to cover every blemish and wrinkle, this is not the right makeup.  You get moderate coverage at best.  Also, you will need a separate concealer for very bad blemishes and under eye circles.</li>
    <li> This make-up is the best of the mineral make-ups. It gives a clean, flawless finish that looks natural and lasts all day. Follow the dvd directions for the best application. I have been using it everyday for a year and will never use anything else.</li>
    <li> Wow, if you are sitting on the fence about this makeup because of the price dont be. This makeup is well worth the price. Its so natural looking, I get compliments all the time that I have a natural beauty. I have worn bare escentuals now for over 4 years and I wont go back to oily foundation. And it lasts forever. I now buy most of my be products on ebay.com, Ill buy the large foundation and it will last me a lil over a year, and I wear it pretty much every day. Its made from minerals so there is no expiration date. I absolutely love it. It gives you the coverage you want but not the made up look. Again, dont be discouraged by the price tag it is sooo worth it!</li>
    <li> Being an esthetician, I use this professionally and personally. It leaves a great finish to any complexion - if you are not acheiving great results - you need to practice your technique. For first time users flawless application could be a little tricky. Less is more is the rule with any loose mineral item.</li>
    <li> Everything you need to \\&quot;get started\\&quot; with this delightfully light as air feeling look ..... fresh and unscented ..... great.</li>
    <li> Bare Escentuals I.D. is already well known as an excellent makeup line and has many suppliers. Although Queen Bee Supply did not have the product in stock when I ordered, they immediately gave me a delivery date and then met that date. Best of all, the thank you gift they sent actually had some value--a mini-sized version of BareEscentuals Light foundation.</li>
    <li> I was nervous to try a new make up, but borrowed a friends one day and loved it. It took me a while to get used to applying the make-up (amount, time etc.) However, I really have enjoyed it and will stick with it. The make-up stays on all day, with out looking heavy. Yet, it covers flaws well. Now that I am almost 40 it is a good thing not to tug on my face applying the tranditional foundation. The brushes that come with this are amazing. I would highly recomend this product! This started kit allowed me to sample which color may be best. I have nothing negative to say about it.</li>
    <li> This is my first review. I usually don&#x27;t review stuff, but this time I&#x27;m making an exception.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 8 months pregnant with my fourth child and I&#x27;m at a point where I&#x27;m feeling pretty icky about myself. I got this product as a present to myself, not expecting miracles, but as a little something to make me \\&quot;feel pretty\\&quot;. I&#x27;m so glad that I did.&lt;br /&gt;With this pregnancy I have developed dark circles under my eyes, spots, freckles, patchiness, dry spots, oily spots, darkened areas, huge pores, breakouts and red blotches.  I&#x27;ve never had the perfect airbrushed-skin-of a- supermodel-in-a-magazine look, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but what I&#x27;ve got going now is just... Terrible.&lt;br /&gt;I was very light handed with the amount of powder I used which is KEY especially with the warmth. When I was done applying the foundation, warmth and mineral veil (about five minutes later), I noticed a huge difference and it didn&#x27;t feel heavy and thick. It didn&#x27;t feel like I was wearing any makeup at all. Even my hubby (who didn&#x27;t take notice when I lopped off 6 inches of hair!) took notice at how \\&quot;glowy and pretty\\&quot; I looked when he came home from work a couple of hours later and asked if I went to get a facial at the spa!&lt;br /&gt;The post application look isn&#x27;t something that I would call flawless. That&#x27;s just impossible. But I will say that my skin looks closer to perfect than ever before. My skin tone is even and it even FEELS less icky when I touch my face. It  helps hide all the imperfections without feeling like I&#x27;m wearing makeup. I&#x27;m thrilled. Just remember, LESS IS MORE and using the Skin Revver-Upper before applying the foundation helps too.</li>
    <li> I love this product...it is so light and makes my skin glowing, and very natural.</li>
    <li> Natural doesn&#x27;t automatically mena good and there are still ingredients that can cause skin havoc.  Talc is natural but it&#x27;s been linked to lung problems and is drying.  For me this powder goes on quickly with a good brush.  My only criticism is the packaging.  If you tip the container the powder will sift through the holes and you get a big pile which is hard to control.  Perhaps finer holes would be better.</li>
    <li> I love Bare Escentuals makeup, and this was an easy and efficient way to get what I wanted. The makeup covers well, and doesn&#x27;t cake up during the day.</li>
    <li> This is the best makeup ever. I have never worn anything that did not feel heavy, but this is very light. Bare Minerals provides great coverage and I strongly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product is so fun to use!  Easy to apply, with no mess.  However, I did not get the flawless looking skin results that were shown on the tv models.  Maybe my skin is just too far gone!  No matter, I liked the makeup and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> My skin looks great and by mixing the two shades, I have the perfect color. I bought a second for my daughter, who has a bad habit of not blending at her neck and also tends to wear an orangy shade. She looks naturally adorable now!</li>
    <li> I thought it was just a gimmick/fad to buy mineral make-up at this price and that it would be no different from my drugstore make-up.  Even after my sister got it for her birthday last year, I still wasn&#x27;t convinced it was so great.  Only until I ordered it myself, watched the DVD to learn how to use it correctly &amp; then actually used the product did I become a fanatic!  I&#x27;m a tomboy so make-up is not high on my list to write reviews about, but I just am so amazed by this product that I had to write a review.  It is so natural looking, covers flaws so wonderfully &amp; is all natural to boot!  How much better can you get than that?  I don&#x27;t have to worry about blemishes on my skin because of products with so many chemicals, etc. in them because you use so little of this natural product that even if you didn&#x27;t feel like washing it off at night it wouldn&#x27;t make any difference to your complexion.  I am definitely a believer &amp; will never use anything else!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this product in Med Tan/Tan, I change color very easily I can go from a Med Beige to Dark Tan very easily I didn&#x27;t feel that the color pallet was a wide enough range for that price and the promotion of the makeup I feel that they could have thrown in an extra foundation shade. The make up itself was okay (if you already have decent skin) I liked the feel of it and it didn&#x27;t break me out at all which is awesome but I have a bit of discoloration from old break outs and as far as coverage this makeup didn&#x27;t help much. Regardless of how many layers I attempted to put on! However, I absolutely LOVED the Mineral Veil and the brushes. The Mineral Veil is a perfect perfector for any foundation you choose to wear it kind of blurs your imperfections. The warmth was a little weird; I had to have been using it incorrectly because it just made my face look somewhat dirty... Anyhow, I give it 4 stars because I ended up liking everything except the foundation.</li>
    <li> THis makeup is AWESOME.  I have been noticing that my friends are asking me about my face and I have been turning them onto the product!</li>
    <li> These products either look like you have no makeup on at all, or it looks like caked on pancake makeup. There is no in between. I would never spend this kind of money on this line of makeup again!</li>
    <li> ADORE this product.  SInce I&#x27;ve been using it, colleagues and friends can&#x27;t quite pin point what is different, but tell me how \\&quot;pretty\\&quot; I look. Easy to use. Quick to apply.  Couldn&#x27;t love a makeup more!</li>
    <li> I used this for the first time today after watching the video a couple of times.  I normally hate wearing foundation, but this is so light and easy to apply and it took me about 15 minutes.  I&#x27;m sure it will take even less time once I&#x27;ve used it a few more times.  My face looks great; I&#x27;m 51 and have started noticing dark circles and some blotchy spots.  This make up gives me an even tone and the warmth works great for a nice sunkissed glow.  I don&#x27;t even have to wear blush anymore.  The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4-stars is because it really is too expensive, although you don&#x27;t need to use much when applying it.  But I&#x27;ll pay the price to look this good with very little effort :).  I just add some mascara and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
    <li> I bought this product earlier in the month and ever since I got into the hang of applying it, I look forward to using it every morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem is.  The starter kit was not enough for me.  After my success with the starter kit I decided to also get the \\&quot;Beyond the Basics\\&quot; (great, also), a blush compatible, an eyebrow kit, and also a retro eyeliner kit.  I am truly hooked now and am really catching on to all the benefits of these mineral products.  My skin actually feels softer since I have been using them.  And as a note, I have pretty darn dry skin, but I moisturize it at night and also in the morning after using the BE Vitamin Skin rev-er upper.  The minerals do not flake off at all, which is something that would actually sometimes happen with me when using LIQUID foundation which is suppose to by \\&quot;hydrating\\&quot; for the skin.  Oh well.  I am hooked to minerals now!</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s start by saying that in the past few years, since I&#x27;ve gotten more an more into natural living, I&#x27;ve started wearing less and less makeup. That said, I&#x27;m still a girly girl, so I&#x27;ve never left home without at least some mascara and a little bronzer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I&#x27;m one of those people whose skin mirrors their stress levels so I&#x27;m prone to a degree of breakout and blotchiness when I&#x27;m very stressed, don&#x27;t sleep enough, etc. This set is good for those days when I feel I need a bit more makeup: the foundation gives pretty good coverage (especially if you use the kabuki brush), Warmth gives the perfect glow on my cheeks and mineral veil is fab to achieve that finished look which I never felt I could achieve, no matter how much or how little makeup I put on and how long I spend doing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, with this set you can get a better job done in A LOT less time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However (and here&#x27;s why I gave it 4 stars and not 5) if you don&#x27;t like the feeling of makeup on your skin, you probably will be bothered by this, especially as soon as you put it on. I gets better after a few hours but when I&#x27;m done putting it on I always feel tempred to wash my face and take it all off again, because I still get that feeling of \\&quot;help! my skin can&#x27;t breathe\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think most people will be happy with this; as for those of us who are a bit more sensitive, we&#x27;ll have to keep looking, and save this for special occasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I haven&#x27;t used the lotion included in the package because I&#x27;m allergic to salicylic acid so I cannot review that product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always disliked foundations in general and had been blessed with a great complextion for most of my life so just a light powder and some blush was all I ever needed on my face.    But with age come wrinkles and menopause and my face developed some brown darkening on the sides and red flushing that makes me look like I&#x27;ve got uneven tanning on the lower half and sunburned redness on the upper half of my face.  I bought the Bare Minerals hoping to cover this with a natural look and not have that heavy and caking pore clogging liquid foundation look.    For the most part, it&#x27;s easy to use and does indeed give the face a more natural look without any heaviness.  I was a bit disappointed with the coverage, I do have to apply the base several times, it hides the redness well but the brown areas are still noticeable, but they aren&#x27;t AS noticeable.    Use the warmth very sparingly, if you use to much, it does look like your face is dirty, but very sparingly it looks very good, and the veil does polish it all off very nicely.  I let my 18 year old future daughter-in-law use it as well for her bad complextion, and it did wonders for her, and actually seemed to improve her acne within just a couple of days, she was thrilled with the product.    I&#x27;m glad I purchased the product from Amazon, but I would never pay the full price for it for myself, as it didn&#x27;t quite perform the way I would have liked.</li>
    <li> I loved the coverage this make-up gave me the day I tried it &amp; was really desapointed that my face started swelling up &amp; stinging as the day progressed. By evening I started noticing red welps I rashes on my cheeks above my eyebrows &amp; on my chin. I have great skin &amp; thats why I wanted this for some light coverage. If your skin is sensitive at all or you have ever broken out from any product I would not use this. It&#x27;s not fun.</li>
