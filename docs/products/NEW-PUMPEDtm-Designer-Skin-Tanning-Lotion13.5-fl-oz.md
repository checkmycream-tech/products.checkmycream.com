<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Ordered Pumped tanning lotion before .. I liked it so much this is my 3rd time ordering it ... :)</li>
    <li> I am very fair skinned ... I&#x27;m now dark after three days of tanning .. Doesn&#x27;t smell bAd and feels nice.</li>
    <li> The exact same thing as in the tanning salon,</li>
    <li> Smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave streaks, but doesn&#x27;t help boost my tan at all (I go tanning 1 to 2 times per week, so I&#x27;m already tan. It doesn&#x27;t do anything for me).</li>
    <li> This is definitely watered down! Kinda disappointed.</li>
    <li> Love this and smells wonderful</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted! Was NOT a knockoff brand 😍</li>
    <li> First of all, this stuff smells so good! It just smells so fresh and not at all too fragrance-y or overpowering. Second, it doesn&#x27;t have bronzer in it, it has a special combination of ingredients that boost your skin&#x27;s natural bronzing ability, aptly named an &amp;#34;intensifier&amp;#34;. I think it does it&#x27;s job. I bought a sample of this at my salon before I purchased this here on Amazon and my tan appeared much more evenly distributed and &amp;#34;deeper&amp;#34; than if I had not used lotion. Third, NO AFTER TAN SMELL! Many lotions claim to not give an after tan smell but I always get it regardless. This lotion truly does not give off that nasty burning skin smell post tan. You just smell lovely and fresh. Fourth, This is the real deal and you can buy it on Amazon for a fraction of the cost of purchasing it in a salon! I love it!! Favorite Designer Skin lotion thus far and I&#x27;ve tried almost all of them!</li>
    <li> worked well. smelled so-so</li>
    <li> This lotion smells amazing!</li>
    <li> Best product I&#x27;ve tried in a long while. I tried the sample packet from my salon but when I wanted to buy the bottle they said it was $95.00 so I&#x27;m so glad I found it on Amazon for MUCH cheaper.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of designer skin and it&#x27;s always worked great for me but this lotion was awful. I&#x27;m not sure if it was even the correct lotion in the bottle. It smelt awful, lotion was chunky, and it didn&#x27;t do anything to make me tanner.</li>
    <li> I bought several samples of this product at my tanning salon. I had no issues with using the samples, no rash or tingling. I decided to buy the product off amazon as it was almost $60 cheaper. I thought I was getting a great deal, not the case. After receiving the bottle, I was excited to tan. I went tanning and no more then 30 minutes after I had hives and my skin was tingling. I talked with the lady at the salon and she suggested I might be developing a reaction to the bed cleaner so she cleaned in with the normal cleaner then wiped it with water twice. The same reaction still happened. The salon lady and I have tired numerous tactics to find out what is causing this ( I&#x27;ve been tanning every spring for years and this as NEVER happened). We decided it was the lotion. To prove that, I bought a sample from the salon and used if. No hives or tingling. This product is not the same as the in salon products. Please beware. The hives and tingling last about 12 hours. It&#x27;s very uncomfortable and not worth saving money!</li>
    <li> Smells awesome except after tanning.. But not a whole lot will stay smelling good unless you buy one that has &amp;#34;tan fresh&amp;#34; in it.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. The smell is great and it goes on easily. Only complaint - I just found out yesterday that the intensifying lotions only bring out your natural tan and I am actually going for a dark tanning effect.</li>
    <li> Smells great and gives a good tan. This was my first intensifier and although i prefer tinglers, i cannot use them when i am going to work so this lotion is my new go-to when I&#x27;m tanning and can&#x27;t use tingler</li>
    <li> Great tanning lotion. Noticed a difference first time.</li>
    <li> 5 STARS! Smells great and my skin is so soft after tanning. I&#x27;ve always preferred tanning lotions WITHOUT bronzers and this one is a winner! When I tan, I don&#x27;t want to look orange! This lotion gives a nice, natural looking tan with super soft skin. Will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product.  I tan but this made my color come much faster. Plus it makes my skin not as dry.</li>
    <li> This is not a bronzer and is not advertised as one people! I love the smell of this lotion. It is so nice and fresh.</li>
    <li> Very happy and extremely fast shipping</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion smells good and leaves my skin soft after tanning. I will be buying more of this lotion.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a tanning lotion that is not a bronzer this one is great! It enhances my tan, smells wonderful and makes my skin feel amazing. It is exactly like the one purchased from the salon but at a much better price. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> The stuff I had bought at the tanner was thicker and you could tell had the silicone in it. This lotion is runny and doesn&#x27;t make my skin smooth. The smoothness from the silicone is the main reason I like this lotion.  But I guess I got what I paid for.</li>
    <li> Not so happy!!&lt;br /&gt;I used my salon specialist lotion she bought from the salon one day and loved it so I go on amazon and puchased a bottle for my self. Received it took it to salon used it and to my surprise it was very thin &amp; clear smell was similar but I can tell its definitely not same lotion. When finished I asked her could we compare lotion we poured each one in a little container they use as cups for sharing lotions and the one I had was NO comparison!  Not even same color! Im emailing this company and contacting BBB as faulty selling. Be careful buying from this company</li>
    <li> Love this lotion!  Smells amazing and is perfect to use if you &amp;#34;cocktail&amp;#34;. It goes on smooth and no bad after tan smell.</li>
    <li> Very good lotion. Helped me get tan FAST. Smelled better than I thought. WAY better price than at my tanning bed.</li>
    <li> I wish I could return this product. I was not thrilled at all.. it gave me no color like other lotions. My daughter was disappointed also and the price I paid is rediciulus.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this at my local suntan place and loved it. Smells good, I can go back to work without that suntan smell. This is NOT a bronzer people. READ! I love it for that. I want to be as tan as I can get, not from a lotion.</li>
    <li> Acheive a glow without all the bronzers! Love this for a pure lotion...which is great to rotate with your bronzing lotion every few weeks....OR can also be used outside because since it doesn&#x27;t have bronzers, it won&#x27;t cause any streaking from sweat or water. No after tan smell AT ALL, which is totally AWESOME!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this lotion and it smells good. I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> This is the same lotion that is sold my tanning salon for $115. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is not a bronzer, it is an intensifier, so it won&#x27;t add color like a bronzing lotion, but is a great lotion! I alternate using this with a bronzing lotion. Works great in the hot UVB beds!</li>
    <li> Enjoying the lotion! Smells good and leaves a fresh feel and smell!</li>
    <li> smells great and gives a nice bronze color to your skin.</li>
    <li> The smell is decent. But dont be fooled, this IS NOT A BRONZER. This is a pure lotion, a pure is gonna tan you to you&#x27;re skins natural ability and a bronzer has DHA (Dihydroxyacetone)which is gonna give you a instant boost in color. This is definitely not a BRONZER. All in all, it does give you a nice glow. 6/7 outta 10!!</li>
    <li> works well at tanning salon and way cheaper. appears same as what they sell as the next level.</li>
    <li> Smells pretty good, no &amp;#34;after&amp;#34; smell when you get out and gives good color!</li>
    <li> As a previous Sun Tan City employee, I was very skeptical of buying tanning lotion online, especially at such a discounted price compared to what it sells for in the store (over $100).  It seemed too good to be true.  But it had such good reviews I figured I would give it a try.  So far it seems to be very similar to a store bought bottle.  The smell is exactly the same (this particular lotion smells just like the Noir Tease perfume from Victoria&#x27;s Secret), the color is the same, and the consistency seems to be the same as well.  I compared my bottle to one of the bottles sold in STC.  The only thing that raises a red flag is that the expiration date that is supposed to be posted on the bottom of the bottle has been removed.  I&#x27;ve only been to the tanning bed once since getting the lotion, but I got better results from that one visit than I had been getting from my previous visits where I didn&#x27;t use any lotion at all.  The best part about this lotion is that it doesn&#x27;t contain any artificial bronzers, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about waiting to shower after tanning, getting uneven color around your hands and feet, or staining any of your clothing.  I would absolutely buy this lotion again and recommend it to a friend.  You can&#x27;t beat an 80% discount!</li>
    <li> This product got good reviews so I tried it. It&#x27;s just ok. I buy a lot of different lotions on Amazon and in general all have been really good. So one so so one. Oh well not too bad.</li>
    <li> Great intensifier that let&#x27;s you get above the tanning plateau.</li>
    <li> Knock-off item sold as an authentic. Google &amp;#34;Designer Skin Pumped&amp;#34; and you can see the color differences in the cap and the writing. The lotion is thin and not at all like the Pumped I compared it to at the salon. Will not use because I don&#x27;t know for sure what&#x27;s really in the bottle.</li>
    <li> Is okay nothing to get excited about.</li>
    <li> Smells great, Keeps ya smooth n silky!  Great step to go to once you get to :I cant get any darker&amp;#34;!!</li>
    <li> Love the turn out look ! It does not make you look orange. Makes your skin feel amazing after also</li>
    <li> To be honest, how a lotion smells has a huge factor in whether or not I will buy it.(I hate fruity smells) I smelled this at the salon and LOVED the smell(I like more musky or perfumey)..  But they wanted almost $90 for a bottle. I did some looking online and found it here for a whole lot less, and I love that it had no DHA or cosmetic bronzers. Also love lotion with silicone and this one has it. It feels fantastic on your skin and I noticed a deeper color after my first use. I&#x27;ve used A LOT of different tanning lotions over the years... THIS IS MY NEW FAVORITE LOTION!!!</li>
    <li> Awesome product. This lotion makes your skin silky smooth and gives you and flawless tan. Cannot beat the price. Quick shipping.</li>
    <li> Loved this. Had heard a bunch of ppl say to watch out for amazon... Blah blah blah. Its totally worth it and u can&#x27;t beat the prices!!!</li>
    <li> not what I thought the product would be.</li>
    <li> Love it! In just 2 applications I could tell a big difference.  It doesn&#x27;t have a bad small like most tanning lotions do and it doesn&#x27;t come off when you shower!! I love it and def recommend it!</li>
    <li> This DS lotion is amazing. I work in tanning and this is possibly my fav product, especially going into summer. Fresh long lasting scent and not too much silicone so it&#x27;s nice and light weight.</li>
    <li> Great product! Smells great and goes on smooth, best lotion I&#x27;ve used in a long time. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion!  It is wonderful!!! It smells great, and really helps get good color when tanning in the tanning bed.</li>
    <li> I just used this product for the first time.  I tan on my lunch break, and I hate smelling like I&#x27;ve in tanning for the rest of the day.  The scent of this lotion reminds me of Escada&#x27;s limited release perfumes from 10 years ago (Paradise something or other).  I also hate using bronzers, because they are so messy.  I love that this is NOT one.  Hopefully it delivers on the intensified tan.</li>
    <li> If you want to deepen your tan, but not with any sort of cosmetic bronzer, I recommend Pumped!  Excellent indoor and works great for outdoor tanning, too.  Just mix with SPF 30+ and you get great color/ skin care in one.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend doing this, of course, if you&#x27;re not naturally predisposed to tan.  If you&#x27;re the type who burns in the sun, stick to the SPF and stay away from intensifiers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI:  The folks at Empire Depot are legit.  The bottle I purchased from them is 100% genuine product, just at a fraction of the salon price (I have sample packets at home and have tried a friend&#x27;s salon-bought one, so I&#x27;m absolutely sure about this)</li>
    <li> very good product. Gives a good tan</li>
    <li> Love that its white no streaking means alot to a pale person lol,,</li>
    <li> Could see a big change in skin color just after one tan. Did not burn at all.just got darker. Smells nice</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and works beautifully</li>
    <li> I love this tanning bed formula and was so excited to purchase it on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I have used several designer skin products and this one is my favorite. It has a GREAT smell. I don&#x27;t like lotions with bronzer because you get that gross brown peeling afterwards-yuck!! This provides the same benefits without having to deal with anything coming off your skin later. It makes my skin SO SOFT. Just a sidenote here- if you want an instant &amp;#34;bronzed&amp;#34; look get the Maui Babe browning lotion and mix a little bit in with this lotion and apply as you normally would. The Maui Babe will give you that nice golden tan look very quickly but is best used only every so often with a carrier lotion. Overall, Pumped is my favorite tanning lotion :)</li>
    <li> Fantastic lotion!!! Ive used bronzers in the past and after taking years off from using tanning beds i bought this intensifier to start going again. Used once and noticed color same day. I love the smell and the after tan smell was not bad at all. Barely had any. I will definitely keep using this product.</li>
    <li> My favorite suntan product yet. I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought my pumped from theetanman who&#x27;s always sent me real bottles. This is the best intensifier ive used and gets me so dark after a single session I feel like id be too dark if I tanned the next day. It smells so good too before and after your done in the beds. I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would be as good as pheonician but it totally is. I brought it to my tanning salons and they compared it. Totally happy with this purchase I would buy this again!!</li>
