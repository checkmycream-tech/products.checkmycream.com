      <li>it&#x27;s somewhat oily on top, but</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>If you want an oil, I&#x27;d say experiment with oil -- you will get a lot more for the price</li>
      <li>They were more affordable than the ones at the salon</li>
      <li>get better results at a better price using food-grade coconut oil before shampooing (a so-called \\&quot;pre-poo\\&quot;).</li>
      <li>I am so glad that I did.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>And despite my hair being color treated it has always been healthy until this happened.</li>
      <li>More background - most perfumes and air fresheners give me headaches.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it on the top of my head and it DOESN&#x27;T turn my hair into a stringy, greasy</li>
      <li>it smells pretty good</li>
      <li>It is very light weight when applied and it makes my hair feel smooth and silky.</li>
      <li>It is so good for restoring soft beautiful and natural hair.</li>
      <li>This stuff smells so good that I use it on my hair to attract my new boyfriend.  </li>
      <li>I have fine, unruly hair and it can look and feel oily when using some products.</li>
      <li>Its very light weight and handy as it can be sprayed directly.</li>
      <li>I used this 2 times in 4 days and it made a huge difference.</li>
      <li>smooth some through your hair for buns and braids, and they stay even, with no fly-aways.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Since using this product I am smooth, in control hair.</li>
      <li>Silicones are also confirmed by the &#x27;cones listed in the ingredient list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Obviously you could spray too much and get an oily look but use your best judgement when applying it.</li>
      <li>I must say this dry oil is great.</li>
      <li>My hair is much softer, the ends look much better.</li>
      <li>I like this product very much!</li>
      <li>I can not express how amazing your Total Repair 5 Balm and Oil Spray is!!!!!!</li>
      <li>Smells so nice that even my 6 year old granddaughter lets me put it on her, which is not the case with much else.</li>
      <li>I do not use it near my roots on top or my bangs - I fear this would give the oily look.</li>
      <li>I am sensitive to many scents but this one does not bother me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>but you&#x27;ll need to find the right oil &amp; quantity for your hair type.</li>
      <li>When I didn&#x27;t do this, my bangs would get the oily look right after using brush with oil residue.</li>
      <li>and I like playing with it (curls, super straight, wavy)</li>
      <li>; make my hair soft, and while not completely straight, it is pretty great.</li>
      <li>There also are oil hair products available which are more forgiving than pure coconut or olive oil, but this product is certainly not one of them because ...</li>
      <li>I used this on my hair it has been so hot here</li>
      <li>He always tells me that I smell pretty</li>
      <li>Alcohol being one of the first ingredients on that list.</li>
      <li>so I went overboard first time.  </li>
      <li>Having said all of that, I was looking for a leave-in product that would keep my hair soft, silky, shiny and healthy without weighing it down as my hair is very fine.</li>
      <li>So presumably, after initial uses, you can reduce the frequency to maintain soft and healthy!</li>
      <li>Other then that it has a nice slip when I sprayed it onto my hair and some got on my fingers.</li>
      <li>I get tired of reading beauty and hair product reviews without enough information, so when I used this on my hair and got amazing results, I vowed to give good information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I also stopped blowing it dry most of the time to ease the stress on it.</li>
      <li>Some of my friends use pure food-grade olive oil after shampooing but before styling.</li>
      <li>I will have to keep looking for something that really helps my hair</li>
      <li>You dont need much.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not even real oil, it&#x27;s a blend of additives and oil.</li>
      <li>and it really turns him on.  </li>
      <li>use this a couple of times a week just for hair health, because I blow-dry so much during the work week.  </li>
      <li>I have noticed that after using this oil my hair detangles much easier</li>
      <li>I am a Caucasian (in my 40s) with straight hair.</li>
      <li>And its just as soft as it was before the faulty curling iron incident!!!</li>
      <li>I am in complete awe after the first use.</li>
      <li>The down side to the curling iron being faulty was that my hair was already color treated on top of it.</li>
      <li>My hair had become dry and damaged primarily at the ends.</li>
      <li>When I do blow it dry after using the oil, my hair looks smooth and feels soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Makes my hair smooth and not that dry after shower.</li>
      <li>product also has a clean very slightly flowery smell that is not bad.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Total Repair softened the dry hair, and turned my straw-like strands silky and healthy.  </li>
      <li>I am African American with fine chemically relaxed hair.</li>
      <li>I have long straight black hair, I love it</li>
      <li>Small price to pay for soft, healthy hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have not used it on my hair for the past 4 days (4 hairwashings) but my hair still feels soft and healthy.</li>
      <li>Good thick oil, does work on my dry, frizzy hair.</li>
      <li>To avoid this I don&#x27;t use it if I&#x27;m showering right before bed, and I keep my hair off my face until it is completely dry.</li>
      <li>I gotta say that this product surprised me.</li>
      <li>So far I like it, to me</li>
      <li>and I like what I see so far.</li>
      <li>Leaves hair soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>My hair is pretty dry at the ends though, from coloring.</li>
      <li>My combination hair condition has evened out almost to normal after only two weeks of use.  </li>
      <li>This dry oil really works-</li>
      <li>I use all the products of this line (shampoo, conditioner, damage erasing balm, restorative dry oil) and it really repairs.</li>
      <li>you are looking for a silicone product, you&#x27;re in luck because this L&#x27;Oreal product has enough silicone in it to make it immediately recognizable as silicone on the first try -- that slippery, slick feel.</li>

<ol>
    <li> Item arrived on time. I have been using this for the past two weeks and I like what I see so far. Hair isnt oily nor heavy</li>
    <li> I love it! I&#x27;ve tried this before so I decided to purchase it through here, I recommend this product and it smells amazing! :) I apply this when my hair is mostly wet.</li>
    <li> I used this on my hair it has been so hot here you can only put your hair in a ponytail.</li>
    <li> This helps some but it&#x27;s not magic</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! I noticed my hair was starting to stick to my flat iron when I curled it.......stylist told me my hair was &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;.....tried out this product one time and WOW, it is AWESOME! Made my hair silky smooth and no more sticking in the flat iron! No greasy looking hair here.....PERFECT, BUY IT! I used it with the Total Repair 5 Shampoo and Conditioner......</li>
    <li> Its very light weight and handy as it can be sprayed directly.</li>
    <li> L&#x27;Oreal Total Repair Restorative Oil keeps its promise!  I have \\&quot;combination\\&quot; hair;  it&#x27;s somewhat oily on top, but very dry mid-length and almost like straw near the ends.  Total Repair softened the dry hair, and turned my straw-like strands silky and healthy.  I&#x27;ve used it on the top of my head and it DOESN&#x27;T turn my hair into a stringy, greasy mess!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this a couple of times a week just for hair health, because I blow-dry so much during the work week.  My combination hair condition has evened out almost to normal after only two weeks of use.  It&#x27;s also wonderful for styling....smooth some through your hair for buns and braids, and they stay even, with no fly-aways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> So far I like it, to me it smells pretty good, I wish there was no cones or alcohol denate in it. Here is the ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;ISODODECANE, DIMETHCONE, ALCOHOL DENAT., ISOPROPYL PALMITATE, DIMETHICONOL, PARFUM/FRAGRANCE, OLEA EUROPEAEA OIL/OLIVE  FRUIT OIL, COCOS NUCIFERA OIL/ COCONUT OIL, LINALOOL, HEXYL CINNAMAL, BENZYL SALICYLATE, BENZYL ALCOHOL, LIMONENE, AMYL CINNAMAL, CITRONELLOL, 2-OLEAMIDO-1,3-OCTADECANEDIOL, ALPHA-ISO-METHYLIONONE, HYDROXYISOHEXYL 2-CYCLOHEXENE CARBOXALDEHYDE, GERANIOL, ISOEUGENOL, CARROT OIL/BETA-CAROTENE.&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;m going to be trying something different because of those issues I stated. Other then that it has a nice slip when I sprayed it onto my hair and some got on my fingers. I wanted something lighter then unrefined coconut oil because when going overboard on it, your hair looks greasy. My hair is wavy-medium thick.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s light and a little goes a long way.  Adds shine without making hair oily.</li>
    <li> This Stuff is bad. I mean real bad. It&#x27;s not even real oil, it&#x27;s a blend of additives and oil. Alcohol being one of the first ingredients on that list. It irritated my scalp, and it did nothing for my hair. This is not for girls with curly, kinky hair or even with chemically straightened hair. This stuff sucks. Never buying anything from L&#x27;Oreal again.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, not grease and it&#x27;s help me win the battle against hair dryness, I will be buying it again.</li>
    <li> Good thick oil, does work on my dry, frizzy hair. Makes my hair smooth and not that dry after shower. But not last that long overnight. mybe I should see the function after weeks of use.</li>
    <li> Prevents frizz.. does it need to do more?</li>
    <li> Great product. Highly recommend it. Leaves hair soft and shiny. It has a great scent. I will be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  Dry oil so I went overboard first time.  It can be used on wet or dry hair.  Very good for those gals who straighten their hair too much!</li>
    <li> This L&#x27;Oreal product is not oil, in spite of its label. It&#x27;s a silicone product that also contains alcohol, fragrance, olive oil, and coconut oil. Of course the oils are way down the ingredient list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a silicone product, you&#x27;re in luck because this L&#x27;Oreal product has enough silicone in it to make it immediately recognizable as silicone on the first try -- that slippery, slick feel. Silicones are also confirmed by the &#x27;cones listed in the ingredient list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get better results at a better price using food-grade coconut oil before shampooing (a so-called \\&quot;pre-poo\\&quot;). Some of my friends use pure food-grade olive oil after shampooing but before styling. If you want an oil, I&#x27;d say experiment with oil -- you will get a lot more for the price but you&#x27;ll need to find the right oil &amp; quantity for your hair type. There also are oil hair products available which are more forgiving than pure coconut or olive oil, but this product is certainly not one of them because ... it&#x27;s not oil!</li>
    <li> I love this product for adding shine to my own hair.  My hair tends to be frizzy and out of control.  Since using this product I am smooth, in control hair.</li>
    <li> I am African American with fine chemically relaxed hair. This oil does not make my hair feel greasy in the least.  I have noticed that after using this oil my hair detangles much easier and I have very little hair left in my comb.  I use this oil along with Creme of Nature with argan oil - Strength &amp; Shine Leave-In Conditioner and Nairobi wrap lotion.  Then I roller set my hair.  My curls come out with a nice bounce, and my hair has a healthy and shiny appearance.  I love this oil!</li>
    <li> I am 41 and have colored my dark brown hair to light blonde hair for almost 30 years, and it is very long. I am also very bad about getting trims. My hair tends to feel dirty /oily within 1 day of shampooing, so I shampoo virtually every day, and frequently swim in chlorinated water. Basically, I beat my hair up lol. Having said all of that, I was looking for a leave-in product that would keep my hair soft, silky, shiny and healthy without weighing it down as my hair is very fine. This dry oil really works- my hair feels amazing! The only caveat is it will cause you to break out if your hair touches your face, especially before it&#x27;s dry. To avoid this I don&#x27;t use it if I&#x27;m showering right before bed, and I keep my hair off my face until it is completely dry. I cannot believe the price of this product- the quality is expensive while the price is reasonable.</li>
    <li> I get tired of reading beauty and hair product reviews without enough information, so when I used this on my hair and got amazing results, I vowed to give good information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very fine, and I have a lot of it. I am a Caucasian (in my 40s) with straight hair. It&#x27;s about 3 inches below my shoulders, so knots are a problem. I had been dying it every couple of months with grocery store bought dyes up until a year ago and decided enough of the drying chemicals! Usually the colors I used were the same (medium brown with very little grey) or darker and only occasionally did I lighten it (dark blonde). My hair had become dry and damaged primarily at the ends. I get it cut once or twice year to remove the frayed ends. I also stopped blowing it dry most of the time to ease the stress on it. I use Aussie shampoo and Aussie 3-minute miracle conditioner for everyday haircare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying \\&quot;intense\\&quot; moisturizers and other spray leave-in moisturizers that did not work, I apprehensively hunted for oil. I used this 2 times in 4 days and it made a huge difference. I continued to use it every other day for another week and my hair became much softer and healthier looking without being oily. Obviously you could spray too much and get an oily look but use your best judgement when applying it. After I towel dry my hair, I spray it 2-3 times with my head leaned forward and hair upside down, applying near the roots and down to the ends. Then I tilt my head back up in normal position with my hair down around my shoulders and spray it along the ends - not too much. I do not use it near my roots on top or my bangs - I fear this would give the oily look. Then I comb all the knots out with a wide-toothed comb. Usually I let my hair air-dry. When I use the Restorative Oil and air dry my hair, I put my hair up into a scrunchy so I could avoid any potential residue on my shirt. When I do blow it dry after using the oil, my hair looks smooth and feels soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quick note: whatever comb or brush you use on your wet hair after applying the oil will have oil left on it. So when you use that same comb or brush on your dry hair, it will start to give the oily look. Just wash the comb or brush after using it and all is good. If you are like me, you have multiple brushes and can dedicate one that is only used on dry hair. Sounds silly, but makes a difference. When I didn&#x27;t do this, my bangs would get the oily look right after using brush with oil residue. Small price to pay for soft, healthy hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product also has a clean very slightly flowery smell that is not bad. More background - most perfumes and air fresheners give me headaches. I had to stop using Pantene shampoo (after using it for over 10 years) when they changed all their formulas because of the smell. I am sensitive to many scents but this one does not bother me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for almost 3 weeks. I have not used it on my hair for the past 4 days (4 hairwashings) but my hair still feels soft and healthy. So presumably, after initial uses, you can reduce the frequency to maintain soft and healthy!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really see a big change in my hair, maybe because i didn&#x27;t use it every single day. The smell is great tho! I will have to keep looking for something that really helps my hair</li>
    <li> I like this product very much! Lining in Las Vegas we get very dry skin and frizzy hair, so this non-oily oil is a real G-dsend. I put some in my palms, rub them together, then apply to my hair and then comb. You dont need much. Smells so nice that even my 6 year old granddaughter lets me put it on her, which is not the case with much else.</li>
    <li> It is an excellent product, softens my hair.</li>
    <li> I gotta say that this product surprised me. I was looking for an oil to help blow out my hair with. I am Afro Caribbean woman with 4b/4c hair and using oil to blow dry my hair for a little straightness rarely helps my hair may remain straight for a few minutes, but ultimately the texture feels fried and my hair reverts quickly to its natural state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; make my hair soft, and while not completely straight, it is pretty great. Unlike other products and oils, I do not have to subject my hair to frequent, almost daily bouts with the hair dryer, which is not desirable for naturals.</li>
    <li> I buy it over and over and I recommend it to everyone. It is hard to find on the shelf in the stores. It removes frizzies and fly aways. I use it everyday and I keep extra bottles on hand for traveling. Great conditioner for hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells so good that I use it on my hair to attract my new boyfriend.  It replaces any perfume any day.  He always tells me that I smell pretty and it really turns him on.  I already have really good hair to begin with so I just use it for the scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a ton of different hair products, oils, serums, sprays, mists, masks... I must say this dry oil is great. I apply it to the bottom half of my hair and it makes my hair soft and manageable. Definitely helps to fight freeze. I apply it pretty liberally, about 6-8 pumps and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy or weighted down. My hair is pretty dry at the ends though, from coloring. I will be purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> I actually just wrote this to Loreal which I think sums up how I feel about this product...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BRAVO!!!!!!! I can not express how amazing your Total Repair 5 Balm and Oil Spray is!!!!!! My hair was extremely damaged by a faulty curling iron (had to even send it back to the company to get it tested, my money refunded etc). It FRIED my hair. It was so bad I could no longer run my fingers through my hair and if I did there would be MAJOR breakage. I would look down in the sink or wherever I was and there would be broken pieces of hair everywhere. The down side to the curling iron being faulty was that my hair was already color treated on top of it. And despite my hair being color treated it has always been healthy until this happened. Last night I decided to give your Total Repair 5 Balm and oil spray treatments a try. They were more affordable than the ones at the salon so I decided to take a chance. I am so glad that I did. I am in complete awe after the first use. It sealed the cuticles of my hair!! No more breakage!!! I can run my hands through my hair again!! And its just as soft as it was before the faulty curling iron incident!!! This is seriously a miracle balm and spray! I could not be happier that I found it and that you make it so affordable for us!!!! Thank you Loreal! You rock!</li>
    <li> Do not in any way use this product on less you want your scalp to get acne.. and I mean huge ones.. it does dry up your hair...  i would not purchase this product</li>
    <li> I have fine, unruly hair and it can look and feel oily when using some products. The word oil in this product frightened me because I thought it would not work on my hair. To my surprise it is amazing. It is very light weight when applied and it makes my hair feel smooth and silky. Would recommend this product to others!</li>
    <li> I have long straight black hair, I love it and I like playing with it (curls, super straight, wavy) and this shampoo has helped me take care of it. My hair is much softer, the ends look much better. I use all the products of this line (shampoo, conditioner, damage erasing balm, restorative dry oil) and it really repairs.</li>
    <li> This oil is amazing. It is so good for restoring soft beautiful and natural hair. Even if your hair isn&#x27;t damaged, it will still go long lengths in improving your hair&#x27;s state and beauty.</li>
