### Positive Reviews

      <li>I ended up using the lid for another container I already had (fits it perfectly) and I still like the jar, just going to use it for something else.</li>
      <li>Perfect for use while doing acrylic nails.</li>
      <li>It is perfect for the acrylic monamer, or the acrylic powder.</li>
      <li>But it works perfectly</li>
      <li>LOL</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;Besides that great product.</li>
      <li>Purchased for my granddaughter she uses it at all her nail client&#x27;s nail settings Her grandfather was a happy camper he didn&#x27;t have to smell chemicals</li>
      <li>I thought it would be great to have this to help save on evaporation and odor</li>
      <li>Recieved in great condition ,product very nice just like the photo</li>
      <li>The dish was excellent and as represented in the description and as pictured was accurate.  </li>
      <li>It is a good size and the top cover is great to keep your monomer from evaporating.</li>
      <li>I was impressed and was pleased at how cute the jars were.</li>
      <li>and I love it!</li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>So cute...and nice sizes</li>
      <li>It is metal which is good, but it doesn&#x27;t even come close to fitting correctly.</li>
      <li>It got dropped in a steel sink and now has a nice crack in it.</li>
      <li>I will be ordering more of this product.</li>
      <li>My daughter was pleased as well.</li>
      <li>You are better off going to Sally Beauty Supply and getting something else.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this dappen dish.</li>
      <li>Love this dappen dish, the lid prevents file and dust from entering into the liquid.</li>
      <li>..i will get more of this&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
      <li>so strong like when there was no lid</li>
      <li>This little dish is perfect size for your acrylic solution needs.</li>
      <li>biggest problem was the lid does fit securely which means evaporation will still occur and odor remains an issue.</li>
      <li>plus it is affordable and easy to clean.</li>
      <li>And, as everyone else has said, the lid doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
      <li>This is a very useful product I really enjoy it.</li>
      <li>the glass was lovely though perfect size, bigger than the tiny plastic dappen dishes.</li>
      <li>I use it to clean my brush as I work on my nails.</li>
      <li>Handy for many different purposes.</li>
      <li>Great dish is exactly as pictured and can&#x27;t beat that price would definitely recommend!</li>
      <li>This is also a great DIY product for other uses.</li>
      <li>That is exactly what it was.</li>
      <li>Just overall pleased with the product and the seller.</li>
      <li>Isn&#x27;t exactly like picture..</li>
      <li>Not over packaged and easy to open.</li>
      <li>Would have been much easier.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately the old lid didn&#x27;t fit this jar, but she was happy to have something that had</li>
      <li>This product comes with stainless steel lids; however, I do not think they are stainless steel.</li>
      <li>It wouldn&#x27;t hold anything other than that because the lid is loose and just kind of lightly goes over the glass.</li>
      <li>I use this for my acetone to clean up when polish, it is a little to big for the monomer liquid, but is nice and sturdy.</li>
      <li>That does not mean we do not like the product.</li>
      <li>I knew it was not intended to be a lid that would keep the liquid sealed, but it would be nice if it would at least close it off so that it doesn&#x27;t evaporate while I am doing something else.</li>
      <li>Pretty gross.</li>
      <li>small but able to put liquid acrylic in it</li>
      <li>It is also large enough to save time from having to fill all the time.</li>
      <li>she was having trouble finding a container that the old lid would fit on.</li>
      <li>just gotto figure out how to secure the lid or just use it for powders only n be careful not to tip it.</li>
      <li>Also,it arrived a day early from estimated delivery that was set.</li>
      <li>a lid.&lt;br /&gt;This is a beautiful item, but the glass is a little on the thin side.</li>
      <li>This is mainly why I only gave it three stars.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just a little container you use to hold liquid or powder temporarily, while doing a full set.</li>
      <li>As many other reviewers have mentioned, the picture is not accurate.</li>
      <li>It is a little on the small, but is serviceable, nice weight and depth.</li>

<li> so the lid does not fit like it should.</li>
<li> I mean, yes, it will serve its purpose, but it is not at all what is shown.</li>
<li> You might as well leave it open as it will smell just as bad using this lid.</li>
<li> I am shocked it wasn&#x27;t broken since it was not in a box.</li>

    <li> It is a little on the small, but is serviceable, nice weight and depth. Not over packaged and easy to open.</li>
    <li> biggest problem was the lid does fit securely which means evaporation will still occur and odor remains an issue. the glass was lovely though perfect size, bigger than the tiny plastic dappen dishes. just gotto figure out how to secure the lid or just use it for powders only n be careful not to tip it. siiiighhhhh</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this dappen dish. It is perfect for the acrylic monamer, or the acrylic powder. Several other uses for it as well. I use it for the liquid, when you go to take the excess off your brush this dish doesn&#x27;t wobble or go to topple. Perfect for use while doing acrylic nails. Also,it arrived a day early from estimated delivery that was set. Just overall pleased with the product and the seller.</li>
    <li> This product comes with stainless steel lids; however, I do not think they are stainless steel. They have since tarnished and we ordered these for Christmas 2013. That does not mean we do not like the product. The lids fit well, and we have not experienced any evaporation. For safety precautions we do not store acrylic liquid in the bottles when not in use. One day I knocked one of the bottles on the floor, but the lid did not come off. I was impressed and was pleased at how cute the jars were. My daughter was pleased as well.</li>
    <li> It does the job&lt;br /&gt;Its small but able to put liquid acrylic in it&lt;br /&gt;I would just see if they can wrap it up in bubble wrap or something&lt;br /&gt;Safer cuz mine came  in usps wrapped in news paper&lt;br /&gt;Besides that great product.</li>
    <li> Great dish is exactly as pictured and can&#x27;t beat that price would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I love this product! Lid is a plus for the liquid I use to do nails. I would recommend this glass to anyone!</li>
    <li> I thought it would be great to have this to help save on evaporation and odor but the lip of the jar has a bump in it so the lid does not fit like it should. Kind of disappointing but I can still find a use for this item. I ended up using the lid for another container I already had (fits it perfectly) and I still like the jar, just going to use it for something else. This is mainly why I only gave it three stars.</li>
    <li> I want to order another one just to hold my acrylic powder in there as well. Note, though, that this isn&#x27;t a container and it isn&#x27;t something that you can screw the lid back on for keepsake. It&#x27;s just a little container you use to hold liquid or powder temporarily, while doing a full set. It wouldn&#x27;t hold anything other than that because the lid is loose and just kind of lightly goes over the glass. But it works perfectly and I love it!</li>
    <li> So cute...and nice sizes..i will get more of this&lt;br /&gt;Love it so much..nice glass.&lt;br /&gt;And it looks as a pictture.</li>
    <li> Love this dappen dish, the lid prevents file and dust from entering into the liquid. It is also large enough to save time from having to fill all the time.</li>
    <li> This little dish is perfect size for your acrylic solution needs. It is stable so no worries in spilling the liquid plus it is affordable and easy to clean. I will be ordering more of this product. This is also a great DIY product for other uses.</li>
    <li> I use this for my acetone to clean up when polish, it is a little to big for the monomer liquid, but is nice and sturdy.</li>
    <li> I bought this item as a gift for my nail tech who had a similar one a long time ago that she still had the lid for. she was having trouble finding a container that the old lid would fit on.

It got dropped in a steel sink and now has a nice crack in it. So, if you get one, be careful with it.&lt;br /&gt;This item is a bit larger than a shot glass.</li>
    <li> Isn&#x27;t exactly like picture..my is like dark</li>
    <li> Purchased for my granddaughter she uses it at all her nail client&#x27;s nail settings Her grandfather was a happy camper he didn&#x27;t have to smell chemicals so strong like when there was no lid</li>
    <li> Recieved in great condition ,product very nice just like the photo you  can use it for your liquid or powder .</li>
    <li> The item came over a week after the scheduled delivery date. I am shocked it wasn&#x27;t broken since it was not in a box. It was packed in only one small layer of bubble wrap in a soft envelope. This item should definitely be boxed. As many other reviewers have mentioned, the picture is not accurate. What I received was a shot glass. That is exactly what it was. You know, like you would drink alcohol out of at a bar. Yea, that! I guess I could have saved money and just used a shotglass as a dappen dish. Would have been much easier. I mean, yes, it will serve its purpose, but it is not at all what is shown. And, as everyone else has said, the lid doesn&#x27;t fit. It is metal which is good, but it doesn&#x27;t even come close to fitting correctly. I knew it was not intended to be a lid that would keep the liquid sealed, but it would be nice if it would at least close it off so that it doesn&#x27;t evaporate while I am doing something else. You might as well leave it open as it will smell just as bad using this lid. And on top of all of that, it was dirty! It was covered in dust inside the shotglass. It was caked on like it was sitting on a shelf for years. Pretty gross. I had to run it through the dishwasher before I used it. So, yea, I would not recommend this at all. You are better off going to Sally Beauty Supply and getting something else. Or, just use a shotglass! LOL</li>
    <li> This is a very useful product I really enjoy it. It is a good size and the top cover is great to keep your monomer from evaporating.</li>
    <li> the lid does not fit not cool</li>
    <li> Handy for many different purposes. I use it to clean my brush as I work on my nails. It is big enough to hold cotton balls, too.</li>
    <li> The dish was excellent and as represented in the description and as pictured was accurate.  I can recommend this small dish highly.</li>
