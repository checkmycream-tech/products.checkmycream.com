      <li>;-)</li>
      <li>literally clumped in the back, and on top of her head.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the right thing for my hair, but I got it really fast, and the packaging was good.  </li>
      <li>When I wear it down, I mix this with some kind of curl gel (I like Keracare defining custard)</li>
      <li>One of the better shampoos Ive come across in a very long time.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t moisturize and is really greasy.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery.</li>
      <li>It really works for my hair.</li>
      <li>Read my longer shampoo review to see how much (I don&#x27;t feel like re-typing the whole review).  </li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t like it that much.</li>
      <li>and yes I would highly recommend this product for naturals!</li>
      <li>I tried using less, so it works OK, just not what I am looking for...</li>
      <li>I have very thick curly hair, and this is a nice nice leave in to use between days where I keep my hair up and moisturized, AND days that I want to wear it down.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>It really rehydrates hair and leaves it feeling naturally refreshed and rejuvinated.</li>
      <li>So I normally use it the night before.</li>
      <li>i prefer a clear liquid leave in + olive oil to acheive the look i&#x27;m going for.  </li>
      <li>for my stuff hairstyles this often leaves my hair too soft.</li>
      <li>Frequently.</li>
      <li>I also like the fact that it contains natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m natural, 4b-4c/z texture.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m an African-American with relaxed hair, naturally</li>
      <li>I use this to moisturize and seal my hair and it makes it soft and shiny after I seal it with an oil.</li>
      <li>It leaves hair, detangled, soft, and shiny.  </li>
      <li>My only hold back is it&#x27;s slightly more wet than Ithought would like for styling.</li>
      <li>Conditioner is the world when you have natural hair.</li>
      <li>And btw, I&#x27;m natural with a bunch of textues (3c, 4a, maybe some 4b at the nape).</li>
      <li>The only isse i have is the new smell.</li>
      <li>I also use it when I braid my hair, no residue or major breakage.</li>
      <li>i like creme of nature products in general, but this is just not for me.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m an African-American with relaxed hair, naturally 4B. The conditioner not really what I am looking for. Does not seem like its penetrating into my hair shaft, leaves my hair feeling a little sticky. I tried using less, so it works OK, just not what I am looking for...I need more moisture.</li>
    <li> I use it often.  I like the smell and it moisturizes my dry, brittle hair.  I also use it when I braid my hair, no residue or major breakage.</li>
    <li> Your hair will love this especialliy if you are a 3c 4a girl this makes your hair really soft and your curls really pop.</li>
    <li> Conditioner is the world when you have natural hair. I love all the scents on this line. Yes. It&#x27;s a creamy moisturizer not too watery. Check. It&#x27;s penetrates the hair shaft well without adding heat. Perfect. My only hold back is it&#x27;s slightly more wet than Ithought would like for styling. So I normally use it the night before. for my stuff hairstyles this often leaves my hair too soft. But as a conditioner, soft is a great thing. Buy it!</li>
    <li> I use this conditioner almost daily on my hair to hydrate and condition.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with Creme of Nature products.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Just what I ordered.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the right thing for my hair, but I got it really fast, and the packaging was good.  The price was also good, so if you&#x27;re looking to try something, and you don&#x27;t have a place that sells this nearby, I would recommend getting it here.</li>

    <li> My wife uses this cream. Frequently.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m natural, 4b-4c/z texture. My hair is very dry and hard to please when it comes to leave ins. Most just sit on top of my hair and create residue but this actually conditions my hair. I started using this as part of my weekly routine after a shampoo and before styling with my castor oil mix and my hair has never behaved better. It&#x27;s actually so well moisturized it has it&#x27;s kinks defined. This conditioner has excellent slip for me and makes my hair manageable when styling.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair moisturized, defines my curls, and makes it easy to manage my hair. It smells beautiful. I would definitely recommend this product if you are a or going natural. In general, a great product. ;-)</li>
    <li> after shampooing and conditioning, i would put in this leave in before blow drying my hair.  left it feeling stiff and sticky.  just not for me.  i prefer a clear liquid leave in + olive oil to acheive the look i&#x27;m going for.  i gave this 2 stars instead of 1 because i like the smell.  i like creme of nature products in general, but this is just not for me.</li>
    <li> Iam lovin it!  Great leave-in conditioner!  I only used it twice and yes I would highly recommend this product for naturals!</li>
    <li> it smells good and the first time I used it in my daughters curly long hair, I loved that her hair shined and was smooth and soft.  However, the next morning when she woke up her hair was clumped...literally clumped in the back, and on top of her head.  It took two washing&#x27;s to remove the product from her hair and then I had to actually tear her hair apart to even brush through it.  She lost so much hair because it was so badly affected by this product.  I am so sorry that I trusted and used, yet another product that did not live up to what it promised.&lt;br /&gt;This is an unbelievably horrible product.</li>
    <li> One of the better shampoos Ive come across in a very long time. I will be looking for more of this product. Especially worth the buy if using on hair for women of color.</li>
    <li> The smell is disgusting. It makes my hair feel sticky and disgusting. Doesn&#x27;t moisturize and is really greasy. And btw, I&#x27;m natural with a bunch of textues (3c, 4a, maybe some 4b at the nape).</li>
    <li> My hair is dry so this keeps my hair moisturized. i used to buy it at ride aid and they no longer have it so now i started purchasing it online. It really works for my hair. I have mixed hair and have a soy allergy so this product doesn&#x27;t break me out. I also like the fact that it contains natural ingredients. The only isse i have is the new smell. I really don&#x27;t like it that much. It used to smell ten times better. But I like the product regardless of the smell because of how it works for my hair texture.</li>
    <li> Smells great but use sparingly for optimal effect. It really rehydrates hair and leaves it feeling naturally refreshed and rejuvinated.</li>
    <li> no matter how little of this conditioner I used, it still left my hair feeling and looking greasy .... I would not ever buy this again  ...</li>
    <li> Great for mixed race hair. Works well with curly hair that has a fine texture.</li>
    <li> Love the scent, glad it came back on the market. Fast delivery. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Creme of Nature shampoo for years and was delighted when I heard about their leave-in conditioner.  It leaves hair, detangled, soft, and shiny.  A little goes a long way, so use sparingly. I can&#x27;t always find it in local stores so of course I turned to Amazon. Love this product.</li>
    <li> i seen this on a you tube video.  I do no have any compliants about it at all. worth the moneyv</li>
    <li> I really love this product! I have very thick curly hair, and this is a nice nice leave in to use between days where I keep my hair up and moisturized, AND days that I want to wear it down. When I wear it down, I mix this with some kind of curl gel (I like Keracare defining custard) and it works great! I also LOVE LOVE LOVE the smell!</li>
    <li> the smell is incredible! this product line has been good to me. i have had my locks for 3.50 yrs and this is a great leave in conditoner after a wash. this product is thick enough without being watery. ive used this for 2yrs and it has yet to let me down. dont go by what anyone says try it for you! it is very hard to find good moisturizing products for black hair that isnt loaded with crap that isnt beneficial to hair longevity and heath in the long run. the ingredients are known for providing hair with essential oils and extracts that improve hair from the roots to the touch. nappy happy washing!! one</li>
    <li> I adore this stuff!  Read my longer shampoo review to see how much (I don&#x27;t feel like re-typing the whole review).  Seriously, if you have dry hair you won&#x27;t be sorry you bought this.  It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Perfect!  Made my hair soft and easy to comb.</li>
