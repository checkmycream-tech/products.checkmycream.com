      <li>It was wonderful finding it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>Best find ever.</li>
      <li>L&#x27;Paige mood lipsticks are great.  </li>
      <li>I vary the colors of the glosses and the colors of lip liners and then blend it on my lips for amazing results!  </li>
      <li>good product</li>
      <li>I am 100% satisfied each time!</li>
      <li>so happy to find this available online since I had not found it in any store...</li>
      <li>Got one in the summer and love it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Very Satisfied Customer</li>
      <li>I love them.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s better than liner/lipstick combo.</li>
      <li>Love the peachy color that it turns on my lips.</li>
      <li>Love this lipstick.</li>
      <li>Sometimes I put a lighter color on top .</li>
      <li>I will be ordering more.</li>
      <li>but i would not pay more for it.</li>
      <li>I have used this lipstick for more than 20 years \</li>
      <li>and I easily get sun spots on my lips</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried most of the popular drugstore brand lipsticks, I would put this one in its own class above the rest.</li>
      <li>Hope there are more color choice, more vibrant color available.  </li>
      <li>Great product - I am surprised all the big cosmetic \\&quot;companies\\&quot; have not tried to reproduce this product - so much better than anything else on the market.</li>
      <li>Good value, they seem to last forever!</li>
      <li>I have been using L&#x27;paige Aloe Vera lipsticks for over 20 years - love that the color stay on and the lipstick is very moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>They ship quickly.</li>
      <li>For me, the yellow turns a nice shade of pinky-coral.</li>
      <li>It lasts a full day and comes off reasonably well with makeup remover and some scrubbing-</li>
      <li>Super moisturizing, color really does last for hours and hours, and the lipstick itself lasts me the better part of a year.</li>
      <li>Smooth, naturally colored lips.</li>
      <li>This is nothing more than a stick of lipgloss.&lt;br /&gt;It has no tint of yellow</li>
      <li>This beats any lipstick you&#x27;ll find at the drugstore by far because it lasts all day no matter how much I eat or drink and this is the most natural color of all the ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>Love the aloe feel and it lasts a long time on lips.</li>
      <li>The only way to really get it off is to exfoliate my lips, which is easy for me if I just soak my lips in water during a shower.</li>
      <li>The color is very deceiving.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>It really lasts.</li>
      <li>...would really appreciate a new tube!</li>
      <li>It is hard to tell what color the lipstick will be until it hits your own lips and your chemestry.  </li>
      <li>This lipstick prevents my lips from getting chapped even better than chapstick because it stays on, even after drinking a few glasses of water.</li>
      <li>Stays on for over 8 hours with normal eating and drinking.  </li>
      <li>When I need a more blue/pink, I use the green.  </li>
      <li>now live in Mass.</li>
      <li>Price is very reasonable when you consider how long it lasts.</li>
      <li>I usually use the yellow one which turns a lovely pinky coral and goes with just about everything.  </li>
      <li>My lips are never dry</li>
      <li>I generally use the yellow</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this lipstick. Best find ever. It lasts a full day and comes off reasonably well with makeup remover and some scrubbing- but it&#x27;s better than liner/lipstick combo.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. I have used it for 10 years! The company is helpful and polite. They ship quickly. I am 100% satisfied each time!</li>
    <li> This color suits me no matter what color outfits I am wearing.  It has staying power throughout the day unless you eat something greasy &amp; then you may need to reapply.  It makes my lips feel moist.  The tube lasts a long time because I don&#x27;t have to use it but once, maybe twice per day.</li>
    <li> All colors are the same!</li>
    <li> so happy to find this available online since I had not found it in any store...the heat did not even damage it since it was packed so well</li>
    <li> The color is very deceiving. This is nothing more than a stick of lipgloss.&lt;br /&gt;It has no tint of yellow what so ever when you apply it to your skin</li>
    <li> Delivered on time.  It is hard to tell what color the lipstick will be until it hits your own lips and your chemestry.  Love the aloe feel and it lasts a long time on lips.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 25 and I easily get sun spots on my lips so I needed a lipstick that would last, make my spots less obvious, yet look natural so I could wear it on a daily basis. This beats any lipstick you&#x27;ll find at the drugstore by far because it lasts all day no matter how much I eat or drink and this is the most natural color of all the ones I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;ve tried most of the popular drugstore brand lipsticks, I would put this one in its own class above the rest. The only way to really get it off is to exfoliate my lips, which is easy for me if I just soak my lips in water during a shower. It gets really cold and dry in the area I live during the winter, so keeping my lips from getting dry chapped used to be a challenge. This lipstick prevents my lips from getting chapped even better than chapstick because it stays on, even after drinking a few glasses of water. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have worn this brand of lipstick for years.  It does everything it says.  Stays on for over 8 hours with normal eating and drinking.  Does not come off on teeth or when kissing.  I have not purchased any other brand for over 8 years.  One tube lasts for months.  Shades will vary with your body chemistry.  Price is very reasonable when you consider how long it lasts.</li>
    <li> The color is good, as expected, however, the lipstick was broken away from the tube making it impossible to apply from the tube and I must use it with a lip brush...would really appreciate a new tube!</li>
    <li> good product but i would not pay more for it. ( expensive) especialy with added shipping</li>
    <li> I have been using this as my lip color  for over 20 years. It was wonderful finding it on Amazon. Sometimes I put a lighter color on top . Daily just this! Stays on and never leaves marks on drinking glasses or skin , put on and let dry.  10 stars</li>
    <li> Great product! Got one in the summer and love it. It really lasts. Use lip gloss with for a bit of shine</li>
    <li> L&#x27;Paige mood lipsticks are great.  I love them.  The color lasts and doesn&#x27;t run and they are never gooey.  The lipsticks last a long, long time.  And they moisturize the lips.</li>

    <li> I have been using L&#x27;paige Aloe Vera lipsticks for over 20 years - love that the color stay on and the lipstick is very moisturizing.  My lips are never dry and I do not have constantly re-apply. Great product - I am surprised all the big cosmetic \\&quot;companies\\&quot; have not tried to reproduce this product - so much better than anything else on the market. I have tried them all and still come back to L&#x27;paige!</li>
    <li> Long lasting lipstick as advertized.  Hope there are more color choice, more vibrant color available.  This is my regular everyday lipstick</li>
    <li> I have been a user of L Paige Lipstick for over 30 years.  I generally use the yellow (coral).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I play with the color if I need another shade, I have all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad they don.t advertise more, I found this product in a small boutique on Sanibel Island in Florida&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; in the 60&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now live in Mass. where can I get this Lipstick North of Boston?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very Satisfied Customer</li>

    <li> I have used this lipstick for more than 20 years \ it&#x27;s the only lipstick I ever put on.  It has gteat staying power and leave lips moist [even elderly lips!]  I usually use the yellow one which turns a lovely pinky coral and goes with just about everything.  When I need a more blue/pink, I use the green.  Good value, they seem to last forever!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this lipstick as my ONLY lipstick that I layer other colored glosses over for 12 years and I get RAVE REVIEWS on my lips! I vary the colors of the glosses and the colors of lip liners and then blend it on my lips for amazing results!  Whoever gave it a 1 star rating did not read about the product which turns PINK on lips and was never intended to be YELLOW!  Also it&#x27;s cheaper shipping to go to the L&#x27;Paige company website or ebay!</li>
    <li> Smooth, naturally colored lips.</li>
