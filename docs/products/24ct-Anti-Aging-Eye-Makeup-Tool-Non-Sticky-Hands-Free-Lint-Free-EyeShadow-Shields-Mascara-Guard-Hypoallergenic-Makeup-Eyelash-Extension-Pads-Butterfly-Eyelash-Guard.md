<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The item is so bad !!&lt;br /&gt;Its not practical for applying eyeshadow like the regular shadow sheild !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate it 👎🏽</li>
    <li> It offers a precise and wide coverage under the eyes that works well for eyeshadows and mascara.  My skin is very sensitive for mascara removers. I use eyelash guard when I remove mascara and it illuminated the problem. This is the best beauty tool that deserves 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I saw the butterfly eyelash guard on NBC Today, bought it and I love it. It works exactly as described. Highly recommend this cosmetic tool and the seller.</li>
    <li> This product is great!! Worth every penny!  I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.  Very easy to use and I love that its hypoallergenic.</li>
    <li> Problem 1. Mascara penetration deep into the skin - TRUE. This is scary!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem 2. We are damaging our skin and eyelashes  and aging our skin by careless daily applying and removing eye makeup-TRUE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem 3.  Allergic reactions to tapes/gel patches problem -TRUE.  We are lucky that not every person is so sensitive, but I prefer do not take a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use, perfect fit -TRUE, if you look at the instruction and follow it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Useful for mascara, eyeshadow, extensions and perms-TRUE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price for professionals-VERY GOOD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m disappointed because of lack of the professionally done video tutorial. However, after experiencing with this tool I believe that it has a very bright future.</li>
    <li> Brilliant product! One of those &amp;#34;why didn&#x27;t I think of that&amp;#34; ideas. Every morning I had to delicately wipe off excess eye shadow dust from my cheeks, but no longer. Have you ever sneezed just after applying mascara? Disaster. No worries with the guard. Simple design, straight forward, no chemicals, good beauty buy!</li>
    <li> I LOVE using darker color eyeshadows in my crease, but HATE having the loose pigments fall onto my under eye area, and look like I have a black eye when I wipe them away....Then having to remove the makeup, and reapplying all over again... These things are GREAT! I received a small box of 30 of them. I have reused my first one about ten times already so they will last a good while. I suggest you buy these!!</li>
    <li> I have always worried about long term effects of using mascara. When I read articles that talked about how pigments from the mascara can lodge in the skin under my eyes, I decided to try a few different products to protect my skin. The Butterfly Eyelash Guard is the easiest and cleanest product for putting on mascara, and it makes it quicker to put on. I use it every day.</li>
    <li> These things move about and make it impossible to see. No way can you apply dye to your lower lashes, if you look down you get the stuff in your eyes.</li>
    <li> I’m wearing heavy makeup all day long because of my profession.  After reading all medical information about eye makeup problems I convinced that makeup application and removal should not be rushed and be messy because it premature aging our skin.  Thanks to this product that is teaching the save eye makeup use. The Eyelash Guard is my choice after trying all other products on the market. It is easy to use, it does not stick to the skin and it has a good coverage that catches shadow fallout and protects from mascara smudges. I highly recommend it as a must-have cosmetic tool especially for teens, for “smoky eyes”, for women with a poor vision and shaky hands.</li>
    <li> My skin and eyes are very sensitive. I love mascara; however, I was wearing it seldom because of this problem. I learned to wear eye makeup and remove it safely with this eyelash shield. I do not pull or rub my skin anymore as I used to do. This eyelash guard became an essential tool to me. After receiving this item, I&#x27;m enjoying my new mascara and three colors of eye shadows every day. I have no irritation of my skin and eyes. I&#x27;m very happy about it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very IMPORTANT advice, DO NOT wear eyelash shield before you see an instruction. I was very excited when I got it. I put it on my nose and tried to secure it over my ears. It was disaster!  I was very disappointed. I took the package and look at the pictures on which have shown how to wear it. Eyelash guard needs to curve at the middle over your finger or a pencil as the loop and only after that, it placed on your nose bridge. Hold it on your nose by fingers during securing it over your ears. I’m adjusting the position under my eyelashes by this middle pliable part. It sits above the nose bridge offering a perfect coverage under the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a narrow face and the elastic is too long for me. I&#x27;m crossing it over several times and the loop become shorter fitting perfectly to my face.</li>
    <li> I was experiencing with different tools for skin protection during my work. I trusted negative reviews and did not buy this eyelash guard until my client brought me one to try out.  I am mad at myself that did not try this wonderful and very helpful tool earlier.  It works great for preventing mascara smudges/eye shadows fallout for professionals/private users.  It works for perms/extensions. Hand-fee/ no sticky parts/reusable for the private users.  I love it. My clients love it. I have no time for reviews and comments however I believe it would be very fair for people to find the truth about a decent product from a beauty professional who does not involve in it sales.</li>
    <li> I think it is a great product</li>
    <li> as described and fast shipping</li>
    <li> What an awesome little tool! I used to always wonder how in the world one is supposed to first apply foundation and then eye makeup - every time I tried that, I would end up removing half of the foundation and concealer while cleaning up the eye shadow and mascara residue.&lt;br /&gt;And when my beautician mentioned that eye makeup can also have tiny particles that permanently stain the sensitive undereye skin, the prospect of eventually looking like a raccoon made me start looking for alternatives. So glad I found this! Who knew the solution could be so simple. Fit to your face (just make sure it is placed right under your bottom lash line) and paint away!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product that I have been looking for a long time, but could not find. As a professional makeup artist, I tried many similar ones before, but none of them worked. Finally, I&#x27;ve found the butterfly eyelash guard and it is like my dream come true! It has all the features I&#x27;ve wanted in a tool like this. No more mascara or dark eyeshadow smudges and redoing my makeup under the eyes! With this tool, I can protect my skin under the eyes and still have my hands free. It is a fabulous idea and a great product that I will never live without now. I thank the creator of the product so very much! I absolutely love it and recommend to anyone from a professional makeup artist to a regular lady who loves wearing eye makeup.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m skeptical of everything new before I buy it and test it myself. I tried the eyelash guard because my friends loved it and now so do I. It protects my skin from annoying mascara smudges and saves me a time. I was able to apply mascara on low lashes from the back seat of a moving car! I was constantly losing eyelashes...not anymore. If you use it for the eyeshadow fallout protection only, you can use it forever. Great price for the value.</li>
    <li> The eye makeup tool &amp;#34;Butterfly eyelash guard&amp;#34; is working great for me. I just wanted to help women sharing my experience with this tool. I followed the instruction with the pictures on the box. I bended the middle part of it over my little finger making a flexible springy arch that I placed over the nose bridge without stretching this arch. I adjusted the size of this makeup tool on the face and its position by using the middle spring only after I wear it on my face. This tool matched the line of the roots under my eyelashes which provided a tight cover over my skin under eyelashes and makes my hands free. This is exactly what I needed. It works for me as a protection of my skin and eyelashes and to save time during makeup application and removal. Very useful invention!</li>
    <li> My doctor found mascara deposits inside my lower eyelids. It bothers me a lot but I live with the problem.  My eyes always puffy, it feels like a sand in my eyes and I cannot wear lenses because if it. If someone warned me earlier about this, it may not have happen.  On how to remove mascara with this protection I would not suffer with eyes problems and would not look older because of my puffy eyes. The new nanotech in makeup gives me more concern.  Would my mascara found its way into my brain?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks God that I have my own mind and I do not trust anyone! Every time I see a competitors&#x27; dogs fight slamming each other with bad reviews it makes me disgust because I need to spend a time and money to test every product by myself instead of trusting people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several months ago I bought this butterfly guard in Germany and I&#x27;m addicted to it since.  I brought a few packages home but I&#x27;m out of it.  I&#x27;m happy that I was able to find it on Amazon.  I love Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never will let my mascara touch my skin, only eyelashes, with the help of the butterfly guard.  I&#x27;m bringing it with me for lash extensions because I&#x27;m too sensitive to gelpads.  Butterfly eyelash guard is a very useful tool and it makes a big difference in my life.</li>
    <li> A really smart item to use.  Easy to apply and quite handy when putting on eye makeup. I use it whenever I am going out.  I found it to be a great value as well.</li>
    <li> The idea for this thing is great; it gets rid of a ton of hassle. But REALLY? the images are so photo shopped, and not even well-done. You can obviously see the computer lines in the first photo, the \\&quot;eye-lashes\\&quot; aren&#x27;t even touching the eye!! As a product 50-50, but the advertising disappointed me the most.&lt;br /&gt;It is kind of hard to maneuver, but that&#x27;s the object you paid for.</li>
    <li> Great product! It is a new concept for me so took me a while to learn how to adjust it to fit on my face. But it totally does worth the time. It helps reduce the damages these makeups could do to my skin, especially for office ladies like me who wears eye makeups every day. I am so happy that I don&#x27;t have to worry about the dark circles under my eyes anymore!This is one of the best purchases that I made on the recent Trade Fair.[[ASIN:B00AXUB75O Butterfly Eyelash Guard 24ct No Mess Eye Makeup Tool Hand Free Use No Adhesives Shields Eyeshadow Mascara Skin Protector]]</li>
    <li> I like these and I bought them a while ago, but I forgot to leave a review. They solve several problems for me including fallout, smudging, removal mess (that is, preventing the embedding of eye makeup in my tissues over time) and more, while not giving me any allergy issues from adhesive or occlusive dressings. The seller is very responsive to any correspondence to them and they really want you to be successful using the product, so it&#x27;s easy to ask for help if you need it (not that I think you would need the help, but just in case, know they are supportive). There is an additional something I have not seen mentioned in a review thus far and I would like to mention myself since I found this info out. You might be interested in knowing the sales profits are donated to their all volunteer, non-profit organization, World Save a Life Foundation (registered in Florida, document number N08000004993, and with the IRS). It was initially established as an animal rescue, but now it also raises and donates money for prosthetic devices for the wounded solders in Ukraine (the inventors having lost relatives and friends in that war). It&#x27;s always nice to feel like I am supporting a good cause while buying something I already find useful and want to buy. Regardless, the product works and I think it&#x27;s a good value, especially as I am able to reuse them multiple times depending on what I use them for (e.g., makeup application).</li>
