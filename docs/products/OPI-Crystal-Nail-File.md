      <li>The best nail file I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>They are undoubtedly the best files I have used to date.</li>
      <li>Wonderful!</li>
      <li>Otherwise it is great!!!!</li>
      <li>This is the best nail file I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
      <li>This is the best nail file I have ever used &amp; I have used a lot of them.</li>
      <li>This nail file is good.  </li>
      <li>They leave my nail edges glassy smooth, and offer excellent control for shaping.</li>
      <li>To be fair, the degradation of the abrasive did not continue, I do not have a lot of patience for grooming my nails</li>
      <li>Try it, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better than a bottle of wine as a hostess gift!  </li>
      <li>I bought 2 of these and will probably be buying more as gifts for friends!  </li>
      <li>Love the protective tube!</li>
      <li>The OPI nail file also comes in a nice storage tube.  </li>
      <li>Make my nails very smooth.</li>
      <li>The two sided version is better, in my opinion, and the OPI Crystal File has this feature.  </li>
      <li>This file is so phenomenal that I will probably never use nail clippers again.  </li>
      <li>I play classical guitar, and I&#x27;m very impressed with these nail files.</li>
      <li>The reviews for this nail file sounded convincing</li>
      <li>Yes, they are fragile but they are excellent files.</li>
      <li>Getting a couple more, so I can have one each place I might need one.</li>
      <li>I love this nail file...</li>
      <li>I love the file.</li>
      <li>I bought one of these more than a year ago, and it gets a lot of use.  </li>
      <li>I love this file, but I made the mistake of not keeping it in its protective tube.  </li>
      <li>I am leaving this review as I return to order two more of these files.</li>
      <li>NO it doesn&#x27;t make the chalkboard sound when you file your nails!</li>
      <li>It shapes nails faster and more precisely, and it&#x27;s also a sleek design that I love.</li>
      <li>but other than that it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
      <li>I absolute love the OPI Crystal File and want to buy it for my girls, my mom and all of my friends!  </li>
      <li>I love how quickly it files and how smooth it leaves my nails.  </li>
      <li>Fortunately, I found it on Amazon and ordered two of them.</li>
      <li>Fortunately, it is up to the job -- still filing to perfection.  </li>
      <li>Metal files take off a lot of nail quickly but leave ragged edges; emery boards leave smooth edges but clog and wear out very quickly.    </li>
      <li>It works quickly and easily.  </li>
      <li>and I could feel the difference, the crystal nail file is much more smooth and sleek whereas the emery felt kind of rough in comparison.</li>
      <li>I have used various crystal nail files, but none are as good as this one.</li>
      <li>it is fantastic, and being fine like it is, it is gentle on your nails.  </li>
      <li>I had purchased a glass nail file several years ago and love it!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pleased so far!</li>
      <li>but I did not feel that it was worth the money.    </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried other crystal or porcelain files available on Amazon yet, but it&#x27;s hard to imagine something working better than this excellent, inexpensive product.</li>
      <li>It works perfect for my nails, can&#x27;t even compare with other regular files.  </li>
      <li>This file works far better than either other type - it removes more nail more quickly, leaves much smoother edges, and returns to &#x27;like new&#x27; condition with a quick rinse of water.    </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Just be gentle!</li>
      <li>I works much better (faster and smoother) than a metal file or those sandpaper like disposable ones and it will last forever unless she breaks it.    </li>
      <li>I first bought a glass Revlon file at Target.  </li>
      <li>I too will probably never go back to using emery boards... :)</li>
      <li>it broke into two pieces on my first use.    </li>
      <li>This is my first crystal nail file</li>
      <li>I will definitely buy more.</li>
      <li>Fast Shipping!</li>
      <li>I do recommend that you keep it in its case or a safe place as it is fragile.</li>
      <li>I had the first for a number of months and just snapped it in two while drying it off after cleaning.</li>
      <li>The file worked VERY well at first</li>
      <li>but after two uses it lost a lot of its&#x27; abrasive nature, taking more than twice as long to work on my nails.    </li>
      <li>It makes quick and easy work of filing and doesn&#x27;t leave that ragged \\&quot;underside\\&quot; of the nail like other files do.  </li>
      <li>It is fine enough not to leave ripped bits of nail.  </li>
      <li>You could really poke/scrape yourself.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely like OPI Crystal File.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended for anyone who does their nails!</li>
      <li>This file is abrasive enough to keep your nails at the length you want, shape them as needed, and smooth the underside.</li>
      <li>This file is gentle on your nails, and leaves no residue on the tips.</li>
      <li>It is much thinner than the Revlon glass nail file and also has a much finer grit than the Revlon, leaving my nails noticable smoother.  </li>
      <li>As with everything else that I buy, I later researched the net for \\&quot;best nail file\\&quot; and learned that the Revlon was widely dissed and that alot of posters on various forums recommend the OPI.  </li>
      <li>Compared to emery files, this files more with less effort.</li>
      <li>since I never did that during my high school career..</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used a metal nail file (Revlon) for many years until the abrasive started to wear out a little</li>
      <li>but I am going to get a few more.</li>
      <li>The material doesn&#x27;t wear out like normal emery board nail files, so you don&#x27;t need to keep tossing them and buying them.</li>
      <li>It is worth every penny &amp; I feel like it will last a while.</li>
      <li>I prefer natural nails at a very modest length, and this OPI file really makes it a breeze to keep them just the length I like.  </li>
      <li>I play classical guitar and haven&#x27;t used nail clippers on my right hand for a couple of years.</li>
      <li>so I thought it was time to get a new one.  </li>
      <li>I have natural nails &amp; I highly recommend this file.</li>
      <li>I read these glass nail files should last forever as long as you don&#x27;t break them accidentally, so the high initial cost (I paid $9) is worth it.</li>
      <li>When I first got it, I thought it seemed too fine to file, but I was wrong...  </li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve used a metal nail file (Revlon) for many years until the abrasive started to wear out a little so I thought it was time to get a new one.  I first bought a glass Revlon file at Target.  As with everything else that I buy, I later researched the net for \\&quot;best nail file\\&quot; and learned that the Revlon was widely dissed and that alot of posters on various forums recommend the OPI.  It is much thinner than the Revlon glass nail file and also has a much finer grit than the Revlon, leaving my nails noticable smoother.  The OPI nail file also comes in a nice storage tube.  FYI, the file is abrasive on both sides the file...the abrasive appears to be the same grit on both sides.  One minor quibble is that the pointed end on mine was quite sharp.  You could really poke/scrape yourself.  I fixed this by sanding down the point with emory paper to dull it a bit.  Now it is blunter.  I read these glass nail files should last forever as long as you don&#x27;t break them accidentally, so the high initial cost (I paid $9) is worth it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product as I had one and accidentally dropped it on a space heater, and it broke.  Was not able to replace it in my city as mine came with a one time kit.  Fortunately, I found it on Amazon and ordered two of them. This file is gentle on your nails, and leaves no residue on the tips. I also like it that you can use both sides of it.  I do recommend that you keep it in its case or a safe place as it is fragile.</li>
    <li> I ordered this, and it came through!  Fast Shipping! No Problems!  This is my first crystal nail file and I like what I see! Compared to emery files, this files more with less effort. I also did a little test where I filed one index finger with the OPI crystal nail file and my other index finger with a normal emery file and I could feel the difference, the crystal nail file is much more smooth and sleek whereas the emery felt kind of rough in comparison. Some people complain about the feeling, I couldn&#x27;t understand so I filed my bf&#x27;s nails and he cringed and was like \\&quot;it feels like I&#x27;m scratching a chalkboard\\&quot; and I was like wha? I don&#x27;t feel like that... and then he goes... \\&quot;When I was in middle school, I would purposely scratch the chalkboard to make that annoying sound to piss ppl off...\\&quot; So unless you know the feeling of scratching your nails on a chalkboard I doubt the feeling should bother you. NO it doesn&#x27;t make the chalkboard sound when you file your nails! I guess the \\&quot;feeling\\&quot;? But I wouldn&#x27;t know what it feels like.. since I never did that during my high school career.. anyways! I love this nail file... though I keep looking at Nail Tek&#x27;s crystal file case... with envy.. but other than that it&#x27;s awesome! I too will probably never go back to using emery boards... :)</li>
    <li> I love this file, but I made the mistake of not keeping it in its protective tube.  It broke in my purse and then broke again when it fell off my dresser. I am now going to order another one.</li>
    <li> The best nail file I have ever used.  When I first got it, I thought it seemed too fine to file, but I was wrong...  it is fantastic, and being fine like it is, it is gentle on your nails.  I have used various crystal nail files, but none are as good as this one.</li>
    <li> Metal files take off a lot of nail quickly but leave ragged edges; emery boards leave smooth edges but clog and wear out very quickly.    This file works far better than either other type - it removes more nail more quickly, leaves much smoother edges, and returns to &#x27;like new&#x27; condition with a quick rinse of water.    Wish I&#x27;d discovered these years ago; I&#x27;ll never go back to disposable emery boards or metal nail files.    I haven&#x27;t tried other crystal or porcelain files available on Amazon yet, but it&#x27;s hard to imagine something working better than this excellent, inexpensive product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this nail file for about a year now and it still works 100% well. The material doesn&#x27;t wear out like normal emery board nail files, so you don&#x27;t need to keep tossing them and buying them. It shapes nails faster and more precisely, and it&#x27;s also a sleek design that I love. Mine is chipped because I dropped it once, but that&#x27;s understandable - it wasn&#x27;t made to be unbreakable. I keep mine in the plastic tube that it came in so that it doesn&#x27;t break or get my other things dusty. Highly recommended for anyone who does their nails!</li>
    <li> I used this fairly expensive file about a half-dozen times before it snapped into two as I applied a minimal amount of pressure on it. I was also unimpressed with the abrasiveness of the surface, and found the file to be too thick to use as a pick, despite its shape. What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I never write a review on Amazon.com or anywhere online.  But this item totally deserve to be reviewed!     I was so looking for my purchase on Amazon.  It finally arrived today, but... it broke into two pieces on my first use.    DON&#x27;T BUY !</li>
    <li> I play classical guitar, and I&#x27;m very impressed with these nail files. They leave my nail edges glassy smooth, and offer excellent control for shaping. They are undoubtedly the best files I have used to date. I&#x27;ve only had one for a relatively short time, so I can&#x27;t make any comments on its durability.</li>
    <li> I had purchased a glass nail file several years ago and love it!  Of course, so do my friends, so I found these and purchased a few as give-aways to my buddies.  It&#x27;s better than a bottle of wine as a hostess gift!  The two sided version is better, in my opinion, and the OPI Crystal File has this feature.  I wish it came with a sleeve for storage instead of the round plastic tube.  The sleeve should have texture so I can find it in my purse by feeling for it.  But that is the only change I would make.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I absolutely like OPI Crystal File. It works perfect for my nails, can&#x27;t even compare with other regular files.  Make my nails very smooth. I will definitely buy more.</li>
    <li> The file worked VERY well at first but after two uses it lost a lot of its&#x27; abrasive nature, taking more than twice as long to work on my nails.    To be fair, the degradation of the abrasive did not continue, I do not have a lot of patience for grooming my nails (it is a necessary evil) and I have extremely hard nails but I did not feel that it was worth the money.    It broke through carelessness (put it into a pocket) and am hoping that a ceramic will hold its&#x27; qualities longer.</li>
    <li> I love the file. I have given it as gifts to family &amp; friends. My only problem is dropping it. then I buy another one immediately!</li>
    <li> I bought one of these more than a year ago, and it gets a lot of use.  Fortunately, it is up to the job -- still filing to perfection.  Getting a couple more, so I can have one each place I might need one.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my wife because she asked for a crystal/glass nail file. The reviews for this nail file sounded convincing so I bought one. She loves it. I works much better (faster and smoother) than a metal file or those sandpaper like disposable ones and it will last forever unless she breaks it.    I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is the best nail file I have ever used &amp; I have used a lot of them. I only ordered one but I am going to get a few more. It is worth every penny &amp; I feel like it will last a while. I have natural nails &amp; I highly recommend this file.</li>
    <li> This is the best nail file I&#x27;ve ever used! I love how quickly it files and how smooth it leaves my nails.  I bought 2 of these and will probably be buying more as gifts for friends!  I haven&#x27;t had mine long either - but can&#x27;t see that it&#x27;s going to have any problems.  Love the protective tube!</li>
    <li> This file is so phenomenal that I will probably never use nail clippers again.  It makes quick and easy work of filing and doesn&#x27;t leave that ragged \\&quot;underside\\&quot; of the nail like other files do.  I prefer natural nails at a very modest length, and this OPI file really makes it a breeze to keep them just the length I like.  Try it, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> This nail file is good.  I only wish it was thinner.  Otherwise it is great!!!!</li>
    <li> I am leaving this review as I return to order two more of these files. I had the first for a number of months and just snapped it in two while drying it off after cleaning. Yes, they are fragile but they are excellent files. I play classical guitar and haven&#x27;t used nail clippers on my right hand for a couple of years. This file is abrasive enough to keep your nails at the length you want, shape them as needed, and smooth the underside. I highly recommend it. Just be gentle!</li>
    <li> I absolute love the OPI Crystal File and want to buy it for my girls, my mom and all of my friends!  I never want to use anything else on my nails.  It does not shred the ends or sides of your nails.  It works quickly and easily.  No fuss, no muss.  Wonderful!</li>
    <li> Came in a plastic tube and the seller wrapped it in bubble wrap however it  was snapped in 4 pieces.  Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> This file works as advertised.  It is fine enough not to leave ripped bits of nail.  The edge is thin enough to get under even short nails.  I haven&#x27;t dropped it, so I don&#x27;t know how it would hold up to a fall -- it looks fragile.  The file has filing surface on both sides.  I&#x27;m pleased so far!</li>
