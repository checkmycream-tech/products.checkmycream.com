      <li>Pretty color, but you need perfectly smooth lips.</li>
      <li>A very pretty coral color</li>
      <li>It shows up more of a corally light pink on me.</li>
      <li>This is such a cute lipstick.</li>
      <li>so I will be buying more in the future.</li>

      <li>(I am African American a light caramel complexion).</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it moisturize my lipstick very well, and the color isn&#x27;t what I expected, it&#x27;s more like a pink color than coral.</li>
      <li>i suggest chapstick, or possibly scubbing you lips gently with a toothbrush beforehand</li>
      <li>soft and</li>
      <li>I do love the cute appearance of the lipstick, but i am a bit disappointed with the product.</li>

<li> I gave it a 4/5 because it does need to be reapplied every few hours</li>

<li> AND the little bow on the lipstick can come off and is a ring!</li>
<li> I thought coral weird be a weird color for me but oddly its a very flattering shade</li>
<li> Unfortunately this lipstick makes my lips look dry.</li>

    <li> A very pretty coral color</li>
    <li> Nice! I do need to use a lip liner with it. It lasted a reasonable amount of time (including a nap!). But it emphasized any dryness in my lips, which was weird because it is a creamy formula. I would purchase another shade if I wasn&#x27;t already a lipstick hoarder.</li>
    <li> Love it, the packaging is super cute and the color payoff is really nice; much lighter than what you see on the tube, but still pretty nice. It&#x27;s got a nice scent to it, would purchase more colours for sure.</li>

    <li> I REALLY LOVE THIS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its soft and the packaging is so cute!~&lt;br /&gt;Also its a great color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy more of this product.</li>
    <li> I thought coral weird be a weird color for me but oddly its a very flattering shade and i&#x27;m quite pale. The packing is beautiful, Etude House is a high rated well known cosmetics company in Korea and all of their products I&#x27;ve tried have been great so far. The lipstick has a sweet smell to it, like peaches maybe, and no bad taste. As far as how long it&#x27;s wearable for I&#x27;m not sure yet but I would recommend using a lip primer/base coat with it :) Enjoy!</li>
    <li> just a cute bottle nothing really special</li>
    <li> Its pretty, cute, and when using it, it has a beautiful pink color on my lips. Love the lipstick design.</li>
    <li> Cute and nice quality</li>
    <li> A lot pinker than coral, but its such a cute pastel color and I love it dearly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have dry lips i suggest chapstick, or possibly scubbing you lips gently with a toothbrush beforehand so it doesnt look dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise its amazing!</li>
    <li> love the color, always a fan of etude house.</li>
    <li> Etude House never fail to impress me!! I always get my cosmetics from etude house. and this lipstick just made my day. Its a great one. I love the color not to, its perfect color for me.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this lipstick makes my lips look dry. I was really looking forward to wearing it. Such a beautiful color!</li>

    <li> I recommend you look up swatches of the lipsticks before buying to see how they look on skin. The lipstick is a little more toward the pink side then the coral side but that&#x27;s why I love it. I also suggest moisturizing your lips before putting in on so lines on the lips don&#x27;t show. I gave it a 4/5 because it does need to be reapplied every few hours (then again all lipstick needs to be reapplied every few hours). Over all love it and the seller so I will be buying more in the future.</li>
    <li> it came faster than expected and it came in one piece,&lt;br /&gt;smells really good even tastes good too&lt;br /&gt;Really beautiful color i&#x27;m glad it matched my skin color when i applied it on my lips.&lt;br /&gt;i will be ordering from the seller more often because it&#x27;s worth it. *w*</li>
    <li> This lipstick is wonderful! The packaging is so adorable and was definitely the main selling feature for me, but the quality is also great. The color is very flattering and the formula isn&#x27;t cakey or dry and keeps my lips moisturized and looking great all day!</li>
