      <li>Came with a pen that is just amazing too.</li>
      <li>Amazing coverage.</li>
      <li>I loved the pencil it came with more than the concealer.  </li>
      <li>I felt like it kind of just slid off of my skin.</li>
      <li>ever is not the best BY FAR concealer for tattoos.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing and covers better than products that are 5x the price.</li>
      <li>I guess this is a perfect example of the truth of the old saying</li>
      <li>Bought this after hearing good reviews, it is hands down the best concealed ever!</li>
      <li>This product is a lifes saver, they could never come up with a better name than glamoflauge.</li>
      <li>Just called more attention to what I was trying to cover.</li>
      <li>I love this concealer!&lt;br</li>
      <li>Rather than camoflaging them, it made them stand out even more.</li>
      <li>I think this concealer is probably better for the colder months, bc I can tell you I wouldn&#x27;t want to wear this product in 80-90 degree heat.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not so sure this helps.</li>
      <li>Better than Dermablend, and cheaper.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this concealer</li>
      <li>My favorite part of this concealer is that it takes the tiniest amount to cover my rosacea</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay more for this product.</li>
      <li>Visible smudge on top of skin</li>
      <li>I needed medium, and I would consider myself pretty fair.</li>
      <li>Best concealer ever, shade darker than I expected but worked well.</li>
      <li>It feels very light on your face, gives you great, long-lasting, full coverage, and looks totally natural.</li>
      <li>my skin breaks out easily too</li>
      <li>During the winter I use it all over my face as a foundation, except for my forehead because I break out easily up there.</li>
      <li>Wonderful, that counselor can cover the black freckles and tattoos and scars.</li>
      <li>Shipping took about a week which was fine.</li>
      <li>This product runs extremely light.</li>
      <li>others said light too light</li>
      <li>This stuff totally covers up my tattoo which is great, but it never dries.  </li>
      <li>Goes on smooth as well</li>
      <li>this stuff does such a great job at covering tattoos.</li>
      <li>So I want something that offers good coverage and yet is light.</li>
      <li>I was excited to try it and tried applying it as soon as I got it home.</li>
      <li>Its thick and creamy, and best of all, opaque.</li>
      <li>really good concealer especially for the under the eyes</li>
      <li>Packs such a great punch for such a cheap price...</li>
      <li>/&gt;It arrived pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>Still looking for the right one...</li>
      <li>I am using it to cover a tattoo, and while the tatt won&#x27;t disappear it does fade enough that I am satisfied with it.</li>
      <li>That being said, it does cover pretty well.</li>
      <li>you are willing to pay for a higher end foundation, I would recommend Amazonian Clay 12 hour full-coverage foundation.</li>
      <li>the only problem is that it rubs onto my clothes easily</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for use in the winter especially if you have dry skin, but a good concealer for the price.</li>
      <li>It seems fine as a regular concealer, although it doesn&#x27;t really match my face color</li>
      <li>The little pencil is nice but you can&#x27;t really use it on zits because it&#x27;s too pointy (ouch).</li>
      <li>The price is amazing considering I use it everyday, but its almost like halloween grease makeup.  </li>
      <li>This product was way better than I expected.</li>
      <li>I thought the concealer was very watery like a foundation vs a concealer.</li>
      <li>the concealor doesnt really match my wrist complexion, so I have to dab some matte bronzer ontop or powdered foundation to settle it and make it match my skin.</li>
      <li>Pat on lightly until all the red is covered.</li>
      <li>, it is way too light even after several applications.</li>
      <li>However, it really works for covering tattoos.</li>
      <li>This is the only concealer that actually conceals effectively.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good at covering blemishes because it&#x27;s so thick.</li>
      <li>but it didn&#x27;t work for me maybe for a more dark person or very tan .</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ll put this all over my face during special occasions such as a party or a date.</li>
      <li>I have EXTREMELY dark circles, and most days, this is allI need to leave the house.</li>
      <li>I am very self-conscious about it, and I would like to find a foundation that will cover it yet still look natural.</li>
      <li>I love this concealor, I dont use it on my face everyday because I like it let me skin breath</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t waste your precious time or money on this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It just looked like a heavy duty concealer that made my tattoo stick out even more.</li>
      <li>step.[[ASIN:B00467B0KC Maybelline New York Superstay 24, 2-step Lipcolor,</li>
      <li>I also have very sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I have some heavy duty dark circles compliments of my genes and nursing school, and this is the only concealer I don&#x27;t have to completely glob on my face in order to get great coverage.</li>
      <li>In my opinion, this product is nothing but a huge waste of money.</li>
      <li>I would totally recommended trying it out, it covers so much compared to any brands purchased at drug stores.</li>
      <li>But even that didn&#x27;t get rid of it completely.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this to cover up my arm tattoos and it did not work, it is way too light even after several applications.</li>
    <li> Wonderful, that counselor can cover the black freckles and tattoos and scars.</li>
    <li> i really do like this a little goes a long way and it lasts allday as well as in general. i will but this again. really good concealer especially for the under the eyes</li>
    <li> This product runs extremely light. I needed medium, and I would consider myself pretty fair. However, it really works for covering tattoos. I cover tattoos on my thumbs, and it doesn&#x27;t crease or transfer. Awesome stuff. Better than Dermablend, and cheaper.</li>
    <li> I have heavy acne and scarring and dark spots. This is the only product that has ever covered everything without being noticable!! I&#x27;ve already re-ordered.</li>
    <li> This color is not just too dark, but not even a natural tone. Really disappointed by the quality as the product is highly rated.</li>
    <li> I love this concealer!&lt;br /&gt;It arrived pretty quickly. It sure does the job! Goes on smooth as well but a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;I love it, its perfect</li>
    <li> I have EXTREMELY dark circles, and most days, this is allI need to leave the house. Nothing I have ever tried works as well.  And I have tried it all.  Covers dark circles and blemishes too.</li>
    <li> Holy crap, this is the best concealer I&#x27;ve ever used at such a reasonable price. I got mine at walmart for 6 bucks and its a keeper. Its thick and creamy, and best of all, opaque. A very very small amount goes a long way and this will probably last me a year or more. Just had to give it a good review.</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF IS AMAZING. IT WILL COVER UP ANYTHING. the only issue is it has a strong smell, but a lot of other makeup does as well, and it can rub off even though it lasts, so I recommend using a setting spray!</li>
    <li> Amazing coverage. Kinda thick. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> It does not cover up tattoos! It said it would cover up, it lied. I would NOT recommend it. I hate this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this concealer for as long as I can remember. I am a customer for life. This is the only concealer that actually conceals effectively. During the winter I use it all over my face as a foundation, except for my forehead because I break out easily up there. This is a MUST buy!! Everyone should try it at least once. It covers all imperfections and yes, a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> cover everything . been using this for a while now . and it met my expectation . all the redness and some spots that is not even its gonna be all gone .. and  it has a good amount inside</li>
    <li> was watery &amp; didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> This product was way better than I expected. It works perfectly with my skin, and was a perfect match for tone.</li>
    <li> I read all these reviews about this and I was reluctant to try it. I decided let me give this a try. It&#x27;s horrible. Big mistake of a purchase</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about this concaler. I use it for blemishes and to cover a small tattoo I have on my ankle. Works like paint, and you only need a tad. Came with a pen that is just amazing too.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I am in no means a makeup artist.  The purpose of buying this product was to cover a Tattoo for a wedding I will be in. I will include a picture on the product page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step one: you have to cover your Tattoo in red first, something that has a flat base, no gloss. Black or dark ink will need to be neutralized. For this step I used just the flat part of my color stay lipstick. You just want to put it over just the ink part of the tattoo and try not to get anywhere else. Then I gently took a cotton ball and patted until its dry (You may need to make it a second coat if any red comes off). All your ink should be covered and you should see no ink after this step.[[ASIN:B00467B0KC Maybelline New York Superstay 24, 2-step Lipcolor, Keep It Red 035]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step two: You should add the concealer with a makeup brush. Pat on lightly until all the red is covered. Then take a bigger brush and blend in the makeup with your normal skin color by using patting with the brush. I did 2 coats but I should have done 3. Try to let it dry between each coat. Never wipe on or off. This all should be done with a patting motion with a makeup brush.[[ASIN:B005JPAZHE Hard Candy Glamoflauge HEAVY DUTY CONCEALER with pencil (TAN color 314)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step three: I used my regular dry powder cover up to blend it and dry. I had to do 2 coats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step Four: when you have the desired results you must put a barrier spray to keep the makeup from coming off. You MUST hold it at least 8\\&quot; away from your skin. If you hold it to close you may get a clumping effect. [[ASIN:B00BDH4D8O Mehron Barrier Spray (2 oz pump)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All skin tones are different so you may need to get two colors and blend until you have the desired color. Remember practice makes perfect. Good luck.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this concealer it&#x27;s so pigmented you only need a little and it goes a long way. It also works great with highlighting and looks great with flash photography.</li>
    <li> She read about it on all the makeup guru pages and couldn&#x27;t find it overseas.&lt;br /&gt;Bought it for her and she says it rocks.&lt;br /&gt;If she says it rocks, it rocks.</li>
    <li> Bought this after hearing good reviews, it is hands down the best concealed ever! I use this as a full face foundation due to my acne scars, and it does wonders for my face! A little goes a long way, and u can get the tubes much cheaper than on here. ❤️❤️❤️</li>
    <li> This item was a waster of money! I purchased it to cover a small tattoo and it did not work at all...Just called more attention to what I was trying to cover.</li>
    <li> My favorite part of this concealer is that it takes the tiniest amount to cover my rosacea</li>
    <li> I loved the pencil it came with more than the concealer.  I thought the concealer was very watery like a foundation vs a concealer.</li>
    <li> Im in love with this concealer! it does its job. covers all the dark spots! also helps my eyebrow with the shape when I fill it in!</li>
    <li> This concealer is amazing. You only need the smallest amount because it&#x27;s so thick and it covers well. It won&#x27;t crease under your eyes as long as you set it with a powder. I think I should have ordered a light/medium instead of medium, but it still works good for me!</li>
    <li> Love love love!!! I would totally recommended trying it out, it covers so much compared to any brands purchased at drug stores.</li>
    <li> Does it cover my tattoo? Yes.  Do I like it?  No.  This stuff totally covers up my tattoo which is great, but it never dries.  It wipes off on my clothes, my desk chair, everything.  And yes, I used the sealing powder.  The price is amazing considering I use it everyday, but its almost like halloween grease makeup.  ITs not great for proffesional enviroment to be leaving telltale signs of your concealer everywhere.  Lastly, since it does not dry, it wipes off.  So, you do not get all day coverage.</li>
    <li> For the price, this is a very nice concealer. It does tend to cake up around my eyes, though, and make me look a little chalky. I do like the texture in general for other parts of my face. It&#x27;s good at covering blemishes because it&#x27;s so thick. The little pencil is nice but you can&#x27;t really use it on zits because it&#x27;s too pointy (ouch). I think it&#x27;s priced fairly and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent and arrived in very good time.</li>
    <li> I ordered this concealer to cover up a tattoo for my wedding. Shipping took about a week which was fine. I tried it out today and it makes my tattoo lighter, but you can still obviously see it. It seems fine as a regular concealer, although it doesn&#x27;t really match my face color so I personally won&#x27;t use it for that, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to work out for my tattoo cover up. Going to look for something else.</li>
    <li> Worked great for covering my dark tattoo in conjunction with Hard Candy Glamoflauge HEAVY DUTY CONCEALER with pencil (MEDIUM TAN color).</li>
    <li> This concealer is really great. They weren&#x27;t kidding when they said it was heavy duty, because it is thick and provides full coverage. I use it under my eyes and to help contour my face, such as my nose, forehead, and chin. I think this concealer is probably better for the colder months, bc I can tell you I wouldn&#x27;t want to wear this product in 80-90 degree heat.</li>
    <li> Package torn. And didn&#x27;t receive the pencil.</li>
    <li> i read about this on a famous magazine i have to try it , but is not what i expected too thick and the color is way off im from PR my skin is yellow but im fair skin i do not take any sun kim kardashian uses this color so i try the same color but it didn&#x27;t work for me maybe for a more dark person or very tan .</li>
    <li> This did not cover my tattoo at all. It just looked like a heavy duty concealer that made my tattoo stick out even more. Still looking for the right one...</li>
    <li> I have some heavy duty dark circles compliments of my genes and nursing school, and this is the only concealer I don&#x27;t have to completely glob on my face in order to get great coverage. Packs such a great punch for such a cheap price... I got mine at Wal-Mart. But I thought everyone should know, this stuff is good.</li>
    <li> I gave it a 3 stars because it came well pack and on time.&lt;br /&gt;How ever is not the best BY FAR concealer for tattoos.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried another brand that DEFINABLY beast this product.&lt;br /&gt;And the medium color wasn&#x27;t even close to my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;I will use this for pimples if I have any or mix it with another lighter color concealer.</li>
    <li> others said light too light well the medium is too dark and not the color of any complexion. tried mixing with a bb moisturizer did not help. Covered dark spots no beter than a regular concealer.</li>
    <li> This product does a great job at covering blemishes and even redness, but during the winter months, it makes me skin flaky and dries it out. I think it&#x27;s because of how thick it is. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for use in the winter especially if you have dry skin, but a good concealer for the price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. The pencil that comes with it is surprisingly awesome....ad for me and my super dark purple under eye circles...I&#x27;m not so sure this helps. But it stays!</li>
    <li> I like a this concealer for my undereye and I like a flawless look and this does just the trick.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get a lot of acne, but when I do the bumps are huge and annoying. This stuff is amazing and covers better than products that are 5x the price. It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> Very thick, does the trick well for covering blemishes, just make sure to blend well. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and price. A little goes a long ways. Covers sun freckles. Has a pencil  to just dab on tiny areas</li>
    <li> I love this concealor, I dont use it on my face everyday because I like it let me skin breath but I&#x27;ll put this all over my face during special occasions such as a party or a date. it makes your skin look smooth and flawless. it works better than my mac foundation! my skin breaks out easily too but I have not had any breakouts with this product. a little goes a long way as well, a drop of this stuff will cover most of my face. at my job, i&#x27;m not allowed to have tattoos. I have a tattoo on my wrist and my managers/coworkers have never noticed. this stuff does such a great job at covering tattoos. the concealor doesnt really match my wrist complexion, so I have to dab some matte bronzer ontop or powdered foundation to settle it and make it match my skin. the only problem is that it rubs onto my clothes easily so I have to remember to keep my wrist away from my clothing.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do what I needed it to do, which was to conceal some small tattoos.</li>
    <li> This product is a lifes saver, they could never come up with a better name than glamoflauge. AWESOME!</li>
    <li> loved this product works wonders!!</li>
    <li> Best concealer ever, shade darker than I expected but worked well.</li>
    <li> bought this for my daughter to cover an ink tatoo on the back of her neck. When she needs it, it works great!</li>
    <li> I have been struggling for a long time for a foundation that will do what I want to do. I have a genetic disease that has left me with a red, bumpy rash on my face. I am very self-conscious about it, and I would like to find a foundation that will cover it yet still look natural. But I&#x27;ve tried countless different foundations. Either they don&#x27;t provide enough coverage or fade after only a few hours. I also have very sensitive skin. So I want something that offers good coverage and yet is light. I don&#x27;t want to feel like I&#x27;m wearing a mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading glowing reviews of this product, I went over to Wal-Mart and bought some for $6. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay more for this product. I was excited to try it and tried applying it as soon as I got it home. It was HORRIBLE! The texture is very thick. It looked and felt like mud. I even tried thinning it out by rubbing it with my fingers. Even that didn&#x27;t help.  Once I put it on my face, it felt greasy and sticky. Worst of all, it settled into the bumps on my face. Rather than camoflaging them, it made them stand out even more. Definitely NOT what I was I looking for. I had to wash my hands with soap and water 3 times before I got this stuff off my fingers. But even that didn&#x27;t get rid of it completely. When I got up the next morning, I noticed I still had traces of this make-up on my fingertips. Yuck. Needless to say, this foundation went where it belongs: in the garbage. There is no way I would wear this make-up out in public. I guess this is a perfect example of the truth of the old saying \\&quot;You get what you pay for.\\&quot; In my opinion, this product is nothing but a huge waste of money. Don&#x27;t waste your precious time or money on this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are willing to pay for a higher end foundation, I would recommend Amazonian Clay 12 hour full-coverage foundation. It feels very light on your face, gives you great, long-lasting, full coverage, and looks totally natural. Yes it is a bit pricey, but it is worthevery penny in my opinion.</li>
    <li> AWFUL, just awful....  no other way to say it...thick, cakey....hard to apply...color is WAY off....ugh.</li>
    <li> This stuff works GREAT! It cover blemishes, and dark spots just the way I imagined it to! Awesome, awesome product.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with this.  I felt like it kind of just slid off of my skin. Not worth it!</li>
    <li> It was a bit dark on my skin and I am NC20 in MAC. Also the pencil was smashed in and I could not use it.</li>
    <li> Product tends to get gummy on my skin; I&#x27;ve found I have to put on moisturizer or oil before using. That being said, it does cover pretty well. I am using it to cover a tattoo, and while the tatt won&#x27;t disappear it does fade enough that I am satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> Greasy, poor coverage</li>
    <li> Thick and pasty.  Visible smudge on top of skin</li>
</ol>
