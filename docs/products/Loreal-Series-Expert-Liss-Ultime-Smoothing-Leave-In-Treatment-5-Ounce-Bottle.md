      <li>A great smoothing product.</li>
      <li>One of the best features of this product is its viscosity  -  so many products leave a greasy glaze on your hands that takes lots of washing to remove.  </li>

      <li>but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I had bought this for my wife and she was okay with this (made her hair too oily) and never re-bought it.</li>

      <li>It also has a lovely shine.</li>

      <li>Will look to buy more in this product line.</li>

      <li>Ive used this for a while now and love how it keeps my hair smooth and not frizzy.  </li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s easy.  </li>
      <li>Keep your hair soft, bright and healthy.  </li>
      <li>I have fine, curly hair, that tends to frizz.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair so smooth and manageable that it is wonderfully easy to straighten afterwards.</li>
      <li>If you have fine, curly, out of control hair then this product is for you.  </li>
      <li>I only use l&#x27;Oreal products on my hair and this is a great addition to their shampoo and rinse products.  </li>
      <li>This product literally disappears into your hair, leaving your hands practically product free.  </li>
      <li>It was a dream come true to find a product that I could put in my hair before drying/styling that kept the fly aways AWAY -- and it wasn&#x27;t extra greasy or oily.</li>
      <li>Results are very consistent - almost no bad hair days!  </li>
      <li>It smells nice, and may do better for thinner or maybe medium course hair, but it actually made some of my shorter hairs stick out at all angles from my head.</li>
      <li>This product works well to calm frizzy locks leaving the user with sleek and smooth hair.</li>
      <li>I love this product, my hair was very damaged and frizzy before this product.</li>
      <li>I end up with nice soft waves instead of frizz.</li>
      <li>Shipper was quick about getting product to me.</li>
      <li>It manages my frizz in the super humid florida summers without giving me a greasy look.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this product for a few years with great results.</li>
      <li>So I first stumbled upon this product in the clearance section of my super market and have been hooked ever since.  </li>
      <li>I love the L&#x27;Oreal Series Expert Liss Ultime shampoo and the conditioner tremendously and use them religiously, but this one was a miss for my hair type.</li>
      <li>My hair is soft and easy to manage.  </li>
      <li>I like this series-super smoothing, I tried Masque , shampoo and leave-in treatment, if let me write favorite order, I would like use shampoo first, than  leave-in treatment, the last is Masque.</li>
      <li>I love this Polymer A/R for my hair, it&#x27;s the ONLY leave in conditioner</li>
      <li>Works really well!</li>
      <li>I really like this product!</li>
      <li>I use it on my dry hair every morning and it keeps the frizz and those pesky short fly aways in control.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used other products in the Loreal Professional line and have been equally as happy, so I highly recommend!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also very scalp-acne inducing, so be sure to really only use it on the ends and work it up from there.  </li>
      <li>We lived in Houston, TX where my hair was pretty much hopeless until a hair dresser recommended this product to me.</li>
      <li>This product works great to keep the frizz away when I don&#x27;t want to take the time to blow dry my with my thick, wavy-to-almost curly in some spots, though slightly fine hair.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>if you want a straight and silky hair, this is the product you should use.</li>
      <li>Thanks to Amazon, however, I may now have a lifetime supply...</li>
      <li>My hair is straight with a medium texture</li>
      <li>I am sure it would work well on other curly/frizzy hair types, but not on very thick/course hair like mine.</li>
      <li>Also, Amazon has a really good price on this; the beauty supply stores I tried were all much more expensive, as was my hair stylist&#x27;s salon (always a big markup there!).</li>
      <li>(what really good product isn&#x27;t), but you need to use so little with each application that a tube lasts a really long time.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t make hair greasy at all, just really shiny, soft, lasts all day.</li>
      <li>I have tried NUMEROUS serums and treatments but this product controls it all, even on a very humid day!</li>
      <li>This product smells nice, but for really thick, course hair it does not seem to smooth anything and does leave a very waxy feel in your hair that makes it hard to style.</li>
      <li>and it left my hair pretty soft.</li>
      <li>My hair is naturally curly.</li>
      <li>I have a body wave and this product makes my hair so soft.</li>
      <li>Use both together on Towel dried hair, blow dry &amp; then use hot Iron, leaves hair feeling smooth and soft....</li>
      <li>This really is the only product that works on my fine, thin hair.  </li>
      <li>and I wish I had found it before I spent so much money on the B.B.</li>
      <li>She herself had hair like mine and used to live in AZ (bone dry), but now in Houston (the opposite).</li>
      <li>I use this in the morning before styling and it really keeps the frizz down.</li>
      <li>I apply it after washing and towel drying my hair, and then just let it dry naturally</li>
      <li>I have been trying different products to tame or control the frizz that hot and humid weather cause.  </li>

    <li> Recently switched from Aveda products- this is so much better. Best smelling product I&#x27;ve ever used. Doesn&#x27;t make hair greasy at all, just really shiny, soft, lasts all day.</li>
    <li> This works well with Liss shine which is a serum. Use both together on Towel dried hair, blow dry &amp; then use hot Iron, leaves hair feeling smooth and soft....I just love it when I straighten my hair. My hair is naturally curly. These two products are used when I would go to hair salon. Just foun a lot cheaper on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have thin, wavy hair though there is a lot of it -- and it&#x27;s the type of hair that goes crazy when it&#x27;s humid outside. We lived in Houston, TX where my hair was pretty much hopeless until a hair dresser recommended this product to me. She herself had hair like mine and used to live in AZ (bone dry), but now in Houston (the opposite). It was a dream come true to find a product that I could put in my hair before drying/styling that kept the fly aways AWAY -- and it wasn&#x27;t extra greasy or oily. I definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Great smoothing cream. I&#x27;ve used it for a coupe of years now.</li>
    <li> I have tried tons of no-frizz and leave in conditioners, and this is by far the best.      Results are very consistent - almost no bad hair days!  One of the best features of this product is its viscosity  -  so many products leave a greasy glaze on your hands that takes lots of washing to remove.  This product literally disappears into your hair, leaving your hands practically product free.  Yes, it&#x27;s pricy (what really good product isn&#x27;t), but you need to use so little with each application that a tube lasts a really long time.  Also, Amazon has a really good price on this; the beauty supply stores I tried were all much more expensive, as was my hair stylist&#x27;s salon (always a big markup there!).</li>
    <li> So I first stumbled upon this product in the clearance section of my super market and have been hooked ever since.  This really is the only product that works on my fine, thin hair.  It manages my frizz in the super humid florida summers without giving me a greasy look.  You only need to use a small amount so the bottle lasts me about 3-4 months, if not longer.  I&#x27;ve used other products in the Loreal Professional line and have been equally as happy, so I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I like this series-super smoothing, I tried Masque , shampoo and leave-in treatment, if let me write favorite order, I would like use shampoo first, than  leave-in treatment, the last is Masque. shampoo is most effective for me.</li>

I apply it after washing and towel drying my hair, and then just let it dry naturally (air dry). I end up with nice soft waves instead of frizz. However, I have found that this product does not work with my hair if I do want to user a blow dryer. It&#x27;s just too stiff or something.</li>
    <li> I love this product, my hair was very damaged and frizzy before this product. Shipper was quick about getting product to me.</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with the product. It makes it easier to have my hair looks good. The item came earlier than I thought it would be. Good service</li>
    <li> if you want a straight and silky hair, this is the product you should use. I wish I knew this product before .</li>
    <li> If you have fine, curly, out of control hair then this product is for you.  Shame on Loreal for discontinuing it.  Thanks to Amazon, however, I may now have a lifetime supply...</li>
    <li> A great smoothing product. I have fine, curly hair, that tends to frizz. I have tried NUMEROUS serums and treatments but this product controls it all, even on a very humid day!</li>
    <li> I have a body wave and this product makes my hair so soft. Love the great scent also!&lt;br /&gt;Love it!!</li>
    <li> I love this Polymer A/R for my hair, it&#x27;s the ONLY leave in conditioner I can use....now L&#x27;OREAL wnet and discontinued it from their product line! I AM NOT A HAPPY CAMPER!!!  very happy though that i was able to procure some before all the supplies ran out, do NOT know what i will do when i run out of the 4 that i was able to get!  L&#x27;OREAL PLEASE LISTEN TO YOUR CUSTOMERS AND BRING THIS PRODUCT BACK TO THE MARKET!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love the way this makes my hair shine!  Much more expensive if you buy it at a salon - not available retail.  I only use l&#x27;Oreal products on my hair and this is a great addition to their shampoo and rinse products.  Don&#x27;t need anything else.</li>
    <li> This product smells nice, but for really thick, course hair it does not seem to smooth anything and does leave a very waxy feel in your hair that makes it hard to style. It smells nice, and may do better for thinner or maybe medium course hair, but it actually made some of my shorter hairs stick out at all angles from my head. It&#x27;s also very scalp-acne inducing, so be sure to really only use it on the ends and work it up from there.  I am sure it would work well on other curly/frizzy hair types, but not on very thick/course hair like mine. I love the L&#x27;Oreal Series Expert Liss Ultime shampoo and the conditioner tremendously and use them religiously, but this one was a miss for my hair type.</li>
    <li> muy buen producto la mujer encantada con esto lo unico es que deberian envalarlo mas pequeño para que el envio no sea tan costoso</li>
    <li> I really like this product! I think it works well without making my hair heavy with product. I will order it again when I run out.</li>
    <li> It works! My hair is soft and easy to manage.  It also has a lovely shine. I don&#x27;t have to use the curling iron as often.</li>
    <li> Good conditioner and it&#x27;s leave in so it&#x27;s easy.  Works great on fly away hair.  My hair is straight with a medium texture so I don&#x27;t have frizzies and I was concerned that it might be too heavy for my hair and make it limp but it&#x27;s ok. Just don&#x27;t use more than a pea to dime sized amount.</li>
    <li> I have thick, curly hair.  I have been trying different products to tame or control the frizz that hot and humid weather cause.  This is the only product that actually works.  I use it on my dry hair every morning and it keeps the frizz and those pesky short fly aways in control.  Love it.  Will look to buy more in this product line.</li>
    <li> Works really well! Highly recommend it!</li>

    <li> This product works well to calm frizzy locks leaving the user with sleek and smooth hair. It can be used on either wet or dry hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few years with great results. This is about 1/3 cheaper than the salon price!</li>
    <li> I love this product. My hairdresser turned me on to this product and that&#x27;s all I use now every time I wash my hair. I have very thin hair that snarls so I use this leave in conditioner and its easier to comb out.</li>
    <li> I previously paid over $300 for Brazilian Blowouts and stopped due to the cost and controversy over formaldehyde. Now I use this product instead and I wish I had found it before I spent so much money on the B.B. It works almost as well!</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Keep your hair soft, bright and healthy.  I will continue ordering this product with Amazon.  I have used this product for long time and will continue use it.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is that you can not find it in any store or salon.  It is much better to order in Amazon.</li>
    <li> I use this in the morning before styling and it really keeps the frizz down. I&#x27;ve used it as a leave-in as well and it left my hair pretty soft. My hair is thick and coarse....unfortunately....</li>
    <li> Sticky mess. Unpleasant grandma smell.</li>
    <li> I use this after I shower and it helps my hair stay smoother. Usually my hair is pretty frizzy and this helps a little.</li>
    <li> Ive used this for a while now and love how it keeps my hair smooth and not frizzy.  Helps it look healthy.</li>
    <li> I have become a fan of this product. It leaves my hair so smooth and manageable that it is wonderfully easy to straighten afterwards.</li>
