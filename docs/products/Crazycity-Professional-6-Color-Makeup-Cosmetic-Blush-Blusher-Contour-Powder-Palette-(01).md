<li> and I am very upset because this is such a good buy but such a waste. :(</li>
<li> Way bigger than i expected.</li>
<li> Well it&#x27;s a lot bigger than I expected</li>
<li> Eh, it&#x27;s alright, it is a little bit chalky, especially the highlighter.</li>
<li> The palette I received had one broken color, but I fixed it with some rubbing alcohol.</li>
<li> The colors are odd shades and don&#x27;t match skin tone well.</li>
<li> This brand works quite well but because I am extremely pale, the colors are a bit dark for my skin.</li>
<li> it rubs of VERY easily, waste of money I threw it away...</li>
<li> the darkest shade is very hard to blend on me and is a little too dark</li>
<li> For this item to have came a day early, I was still in shock and disappointment with this.</li>
<li> I see at least 2 other people who revived there&#x27;s broken as well</li>
<li> so they can&#x27;t be broken</li>
<li> They smell horrible and are very chalky.</li>
<li> It had a bit of glitter to it which I was a bit disappointed with.</li>
<li> Very disappointed I have received mine cracked 😩😩</li>
<li> Horrible, a bunch of chemicals in it and</li>

    <li> Very disappointed I have received mine cracked 😩😩 I was really looking forward to getting this and now I&#x27;m upset</li>
    <li> My white wasn&#x27;t exactly white. It had a bit of glitter to it which I was a bit disappointed with. Other than that I love the product, it&#x27;s lasted me along time. It&#x27;s easy to apply and isn&#x27;t too greasy. It goes on smooth and lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Hard to apply but with the right tools it&#x27;s just as good as the anastasia contour palette</li>
    <li> The palette I received had one broken color, but I fixed it with some rubbing alcohol. The colors are well pigmented and it stays on all day. You can reapply it once if you want to have a very defined face, but I&#x27;m happy applying it once. Also their is 0.5 ounces of powder in each spot. In total this palette has 3 ounces of powder in the whole palette.</li>
    <li> Great for contouring, affordable, good quality</li>
    <li> I am very happy with what I got</li>
    <li> Way bigger than i expected. very worth it but if you are getting it for the bronzer. the bronzer in top right is not good a musky orange not a good bronzer but i use the bottom right one everyday. The white is very pigmented and so is the yellow but the brown colors are not. this palette is huge and way worth it compared to the little product you get with higher brands.</li>
    <li> Not good for oily Combo skin also needs more pigmentation i wore it for 2 hrs with primer and settind powder and still caked up</li>
    <li> Well it&#x27;s a lot bigger than I expected but that&#x27;s better for me I guess lol I did revive it with one broken color 😢 I haven&#x27;t tried it yet but from what I hear it&#x27;s a good product just try packing them different so they can&#x27;t be broken I see at least 2 other people who revived there&#x27;s broken as well 👎🏻</li>
    <li> I use this product as a substitute for Blank Canvas Cosmetics contour version. This brand works quite well but because I am extremely pale, the colors are a bit dark for my skin.</li>
    <li> Def a must have for MUA! Great for setting cream highlight and contour or use alone! Best if used with a beauty blender too!</li>
    <li> Love this product. The palette provides several options based on what look you&#x27;re going for. The colors have a nice pigment and blend well. The only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 was my product had a shipping issue.</li>
    <li> This is amazing! It was wrapped extremely well and came before the delivery date in perfect conditions! First time I used it and was getting compliments already!! I love it; it works great for my skin and is very pigmented!! Highly recommended</li>
    <li> I would have loved this except it arrived damaged &amp; covered in shattered powder residue &amp; now I have to go through the hassle of returning it.</li>
    <li> I love it! It gets the job done and is a great save.</li>
    <li> It came with one of the palettes busted, so I am currently waiting for them to send me a new one or return the one I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it had come as a whole, the colors look great , so as long as they make this right I will be happy with this and change my rating!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This looks great for contouring , can&#x27;t wait for it to come non-defective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.&lt;br /&gt;MY FAVORITE OTHER CONTOURING TOOL IS CONTOURING BLUSH AND BRONZER BY ELF IN ST. LUCIA  , IT LITERALLY IS THE SAME COLOR AS NARS BLUSH IN ORGASM AND ( WHATEVER THE BRONZER IT COMES WITH IN THEIR DUO) FYI!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If you want to be a contouring master for cheap, or just play around! If you have any other questions just ask :)))</li>
    <li> Eh, it&#x27;s alright, it is a little bit chalky, especially the highlighter.</li>
    <li> The colors are odd shades and don&#x27;t match skin tone well. They only stayed on for a short amount of time.</li>
    <li> For this item to have came a day early, I was still in shock and disappointment with this. This is literally how I received it and I am very upset because this is such a good buy but such a waste. :(</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, i love this palette, really good buy for such a cheap price.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I got it to learn how to contour.</li>
    <li> They smell horrible and are very chalky. You are getting what you pay for but if your looking for something cheap these are perfect</li>
    <li> Horrible, a bunch of chemicals in it and it rubs of VERY easily, waste of money I threw it away...</li>
    <li> the darkest shade is very hard to blend on me and is a little too dark but i love the rest of them. shipping also took AWHILE</li>
    <li> the packaging is a little cheap and the powders are kind of powdery but it blends good and color pay off is good.</li>
    <li> Looks good and easy to apply and blend</li>
