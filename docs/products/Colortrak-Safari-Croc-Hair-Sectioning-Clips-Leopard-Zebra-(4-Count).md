<li> Whether you&#x27;re separating hair for a style or do straighten or blow dry, these hold and do the job.</li>
<li> Not worth it to send it back.  </li>
<li> i have long dreadlocks and if i need to hold some out of the way for maintenance or whatever these do the job!!</li>
<li> These are absolutely not rubberized.</li>
<li> Finally, a clip that works with my very long and thick hair.  </li>
<li> They slip through my wavy, long, medium thick hair and are not at all like the other Croc clips I&#x27;ve used.</li>
<li> Get the black ones, those are rubberized as advertized</li>
<li> These may be fine if you have low expectations but are severely disappointing if you believe this seller&#x27;s FALSE ADVERTISING or have used Croc clips in the past.</li>

    <li> These are the only clips that hold my hair up, I now love the option of different colors because before they were only black or some other non-fashionable color.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I own other colortrak clips.  I believe these are not actually colortrak.  Compared to the other clips, the design of the clip itself is different, also the quality.  The other clips I own are rubberized, whereas these claim to be, but are just cheap plastic.</li>
    <li> I really like the concept, but sometime my hair falls out of the clip which is a no no. However, it doesn&#x27;t leave dents in my hair which I like.</li>

    <li> Ordered for myself &amp; my granddaughter.  Preferable to a pony tail elastic.... They grip &amp; hold up our hair in an attractive manner.  This is the 3rd set I&#x27;ve bought &amp; will probably buy more as the need arises.</li>

Tried to manage my new hair style with traditional clips, and couldn&#x27;t do it. Now I receive a lot of compliments about how chic my hair is.</li>
    <li> The description says they are rubberized, they are not. The safari colored ones  are plastic and do not hold the hair well.  Get the black ones, those are rubberized as advertized</li>
    <li> These are the best clips ever, it hold think hair up beautifully when I do haircuts at my salon.. Highly recommend!!:)</li>
    <li> These clips have great grip and I iLove the cute animal patterns</li>
