      <li>Amazing!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think I have been more impressed with a makeup product before.</li>
      <li>I really liked this BB Cream!</li>
      <li>And the color is perfect and light!</li>
      <li>It does have a powdery smell that is pleasant, but something I&#x27;m not quite use to.</li>
      <li>I read tons of good reviews of this product and decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Its not as good as my Joeur, but its good.</li>
      <li>Also, I have to put on a good amount of moisturizer before using this, otherwise it doesn&#x27;t spread that well.</li>
      <li>This is a gorgeous product.</li>
      <li>and I love it!</li>
      <li>I almost thought it was too light (which has never happened for me!!),</li>
      <li>After sifting through TONS of positive reviews all over the internet, I thought I&#x27;d bite the bullet and try Missha Perfect Cover BB Cream in #13</li>
      <li>This product is amazing.  </li>
      <li>so I have a limitless supply of this amazing makeup!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t seen any noticeable improvement in my skin but as a foundation it looks nice.</li>
      <li>a nice, light smell&lt;br /&gt;Works great for reddish/pink skin&lt;</li>
      <li>When applied with a damp makeup sponge, it really makes my skin look flawless.</li>
      <li>/&gt;HOWEVER, one thing that is keeping me from loving this BB cream is the SMELL.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Seoul Glamour ships incredibly fast and the packaging is awesome</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this for about a week now and it covers nicely and matches my skintone</li>
      <li>Honestly, the product itself is good.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It shipped fast, great!  </li>
      <li>I normally use Revlon&#x27;s Colorstay in Ivory and this shade is perfect for me.</li>
      <li>I also found the smell to be pleasant and light.  </li>
      <li>It blends very easily, and it does not feel greasy at all.</li>
      <li>I find that the color is very neutral, which is ideal for me.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t cover the most redest skin, acne and scars, but the more fair ones it does cover OK.</li>
      <li>I got the #13 color and have found it to be a good fit for my skin tone which has pinkish undertones.</li>
      <li>this one is the best so far.  </li>
      <li>(&lt;br /&gt;In addition, I disagree about the &amp;#34;Perfect Cover&amp;#34; name thing, because the cream is no where near perfect cover.</li>
      <li>The scent is light and the coverage is great and smooth.</li>
      <li>The texture is nice, smooth, non-greasy, and dries to a nice glowy finish.  </li>
      <li>Be forewarned: this shade is VERY light.</li>
      <li>I have a VERY light skin tone most of the year</li>
      <li>I like the high SPF in this product and the color blends beautifully.</li>
      <li>I have naturally auburn hair, blue eyes, and very fair skin with pink-ish undertones, and the Milky Beige #13 works perfectly for me.</li>
      <li>I love this brand.</li>
      <li>I chose to try some BB cream as an alternative to foundation, but also wanted something more than a tinted moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>&lt;3  will definitely order again from them!!</li>
      <li>It is my favorite dewy one.</li>
      <li>Would be better if they have more choices on the color.</li>
      <li>I love this bb cream.</li>
      <li>I love this bb cream.</li>
      <li>Like many others have said, this BB cream does not oxidize to be orange and is more for neutral skinned people.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>and I love</li>
      <li>Though it does smell nice, I believe that face products should be fragrance free.</li>
      <li>I will be ordering more for sure.</li>
      <li>in all I love it.</li>
      <li>The perfect one step daily moisturizer, sunscreen, and makeup in one!</li>
      <li>That may take more time.</li>
      <li>MAN, am I glad I did.</li>
      <li>Love the creamy texture, blends well.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
      <li>My undertone is a warmer and more yellowish neutral, and thus this product doesn&#x27;t work for me that well, cos after applying it, the color of my face doesn&#x27;t match that of my neck at all.</li>
      <li>Though I love them I&#x27;ve found the hardest time finding one that matches my skin shade.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t ever have to go without it :)</li>
      <li>For most of my blemishes and acne scars I still need to apply concealer.</li>
      <li>I always apply powder in my t-zone which I recommend with most face products.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using asain bb cream for many years, since about the 90s.</li>
      <li>I use it under my foundation, but if it matched my skin tone better I would wear it alone.</li>
      <li>It really goes on and feels great on your skin, and doesn&#x27;t leave a dewy finish.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am excited to have lovely skin coverage, moisture, and sun protection!</li>
      <li>It certainly looked just perfect when I first applied it.</li>
      <li>I find the coverage to be light to medium and is *very* easily blendable and doesn&#x27;t cake up.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The perfect one step daily moisturizer, sunscreen, and makeup in one! This BB cream has replaced my makeup. It makes my complexion look smooth. I have been using this daily for the past year and will not be using anything else.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! It arrived pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am incredibly pale, so much so that all the \\&quot;light\\&quot; BB creams in the store make me turn orange! It&#x27;s awful looking for makeup to fit your skin on the far ends of the pigment spectrum!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, I was recommended to buy this buy a beauty blog. It smells fabulous, has SPF 42 ++++ whatever that means, and it covers my flaws just enough. It is layerable if you need a bit of additional coverage. It goes on very pale- I almost thought it was too light (which has never happened for me!!), but then it \\&quot;settled in\\&quot; to match my skin tone perfectly. I am excited to have lovely skin coverage, moisture, and sun protection! Awesome product. I think I&#x27;ll buy a new bottle every month so I have a limitless supply of this amazing makeup!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little bit goes a long way, too, so you get a good bang for your buck!&lt;br /&gt;Awesome product- and great for extremely pale people like me!</li>
    <li> Ok, first some background. I have extremely pale skin that also happens to be dry and flaky (terrible combo!). I sought out this foundation after I heard about how Korean BB Creams were more moisturizing and came in lighter colors than their American counter parts. All I can say is, wow! This foundation was everything I could have asked for. It evens out my skin tone without making me look like a corpse. I went with this color because other reviews mentioned that this is a good shade for anyone who has trouble finding makeup in the states that is light enough for their skin. It&#x27;s PERFECT.</li>
    <li> My favourite BB cream of all time! This is amazing for my super super pale skin.  I have about an NW15 skin tone and this suits me perfectly.  It also does not accentuate dry spots and makes for a good finish in the end!</li>
    <li> I have dry, acne prone and sensitive skin. I&#x27;m am also very pale, probably about a MAC NC 5. I also wear the Nars Creamy Concealer in Chantilly. This bb cream matches me like no other, even foundations can&#x27;t compare. So I am really impressed by that. However, I find that this is only wearable for me in the summer. In the summer it looks great and I can layer it on throughout the day. But in the winter it really looks dry and emphasizes dry patches.</li>
    <li> I have had nothing but great experiences with Missha products. If you&#x27;ve only used american BB creams, I think you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised by trying this out.  The coverage is easily buildable and never feels greasy. I get pretty good staying power out of it, and a little goes a long way. I wear makeup almost every day and this size lasted me for about 3.5 months. Definitely happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  I wear it over a primed face, or mix a little with my moisturizer, and it does the job foundation can&#x27;t quite do.  It doesn&#x27;t streak or look chalky, and after a month of using it I&#x27;ve noticed my skin has improved.  Pores seems smaller and I pretty much never break out with it.  A+!</li>
    <li> I think this caused me to break out. It&#x27;s a tad bit greasy and the color is far too yellow for a Caucasian. If you have pink/red tones in your skin this will not look right on you. This tube is also VERY small!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I have large pores and red skin.  This covers beautifully as a primer.  I put it on after my moisturizer has soaked in.  I smooth it across all areas of my face and then wait for it to set.  Then I use a light dusting of mineral powder makeup.  It really looks polished.  It&#x27;s not heavy or greasy.  I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
    <li> Would be better if they have more choices on the color.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this cream. I&#x27;ve never used BB cream before and I don&#x27;t wear much make-up because I have incredibly pale, reddish, sensitive redhead skin. All the foundations I&#x27;ve used have make my skin itchy and red, this is the first stuff that&#x27;s actually comfortable on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Good for sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;Works great as a foundation, primer, and sunscreen&lt;br /&gt;Has a nice, light smell&lt;br /&gt;Works great for reddish/pink skin&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, even if I sleep with it on&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t provide as much coverage as normal foundation, I need to use a little concealer for my pimples/spots&lt;br /&gt;Some people might be bothered by the smell if they&#x27;re super sensitive, I personally found it nice&lt;br /&gt;This tone (#13) is made for very very light skin, unless you&#x27;re super pale you&#x27;ll probably want a different tone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I love it. It takes a few weeks to ship since it actually comes from South Korea, but it&#x27;s totally worth it. The bottle is pretty small, but you need about half of a pea-sized amount to cover your face. I could seen my bottle lasting for a few months.</li>
    <li> Love the creamy texture, blends well. I haven&#x27;t seen any noticeable improvement in my skin but as a foundation it looks nice. Be forewarned: this shade is VERY light. I am fair-skinned but it is really too light for my skin tone. Luckily it blends well and looks ok once I have applied bronzer and blush but if you anything but the fairest of porcelain skin tones I recommend getting a slightly darker shade.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had to look for &amp;#34;the palest foundation you have&amp;#34; when I walk into store, and finally I found one that is pale enough for my skin. Only downside is that my oily skin tends to get very shiny throughout the day with this on.</li>
    <li> I love this brand. It really caters to my my fair, or redish skin when I look tired or want a brighter look.</li>
    <li> I have tried other foundations and BB creams, from high to low. This is a really great product that works with my very fair skin to cover any redness or blemishes I have. When applied with a damp makeup sponge, it really makes my skin look flawless.</li>
    <li> I love this bb cream!! Best ever! It really fits my face! And the color is perfect and light! It shipped fast, great!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Something pale enough to match my skin tone, goes on smooth, soaks in but leaves a more even complexion. The moisture and SPF help, too.</li>
    <li> I have a VERY light skin tone most of the year and I have a hard time finding the right products to use. I read tons of good reviews of this product and decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first reaction was &amp;#34;YESS!! Light enough!&amp;#34;. It certainly looked just perfect when I first applied it. However after letting the cream oxidise for a while my mood dropped. At first glance the color of the cream was pretty neutral, but after oxidation it takes quite clear pinkish undertone in daylight. My undertone is a warmer and more yellowish neutral, and thus this product doesn&#x27;t work for me that well, cos after applying it, the color of my face doesn&#x27;t match that of my neck at all. :(&lt;br /&gt;In addition, I disagree about the &amp;#34;Perfect Cover&amp;#34; name thing, because the cream is no where near perfect cover. It does blend pretty nicely on the skin and reduces redness and evens out the skin tone overall, but I&#x27;ve used other BB creams with way better coverage. For most of my blemishes and acne scars I still need to apply concealer. :/&lt;br /&gt;Points for the light color, nice lightweight feel on the skin and high SPF and PA! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would give this 3½. The product is nice and light on the skin, blends ok and evens out your skin tone pretty well. The coverage is little above medium I&#x27;d say. Doesn&#x27;t cover the most redest skin, acne and scars, but the more fair ones it does cover OK. For oily skinned this doesn&#x27;t stay that nicely, I have to start using powder paper and powder after a few hours already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this for people with fair, normal skin with more pinkish undertone.</li>
    <li> This is a gorgeous product. Best applied with your fingers. Has a beautiful coverage and dewy finish. I always apply powder in my t-zone which I recommend with most face products. And no weird smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other BB creams, nothing comes close.  Long wear, natural look, feels great on my skin. I use a foundation brush which makes it look even more even and natural...this stuff is awesome!</li>
    <li> Makes your face burn, do not use with sensitive skin</li>
    <li> I have naturally auburn hair, blue eyes, and very fair skin with pink-ish undertones, and the Milky Beige #13 works perfectly for me. My skin also tends to be both sensitive and dry, and this BB cream adds a touch of moisture and does not make me break out. I actually think that my skin looks better since I began using it. It blends very easily, and it does not feel greasy at all. It is also a full coverage cream, so while it looks very natural, I don&#x27;t have to use any extra concealer on any of the areas of my face that tend to show redness. I used to have to set my old makeup with powder, and then touch up during the day, but I don&#x27;t feel that this makeup requires a setting powder. When I look at my face in the mirror at the end of a 10 hour workday, it still looks set, fairly matte, and completely natural. The bottle is pretty small, but I&#x27;ve been using it for 2-3 weeks now, and I definitely have a 3-4 week supply left, if not more. You really don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it.</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  Light coverage.  I&#x27;m a pale (like, really pale) red head that&#x27;s a &amp;#34;make up minimalist,&amp;#34; the 13 was perfect for me!</li>
    <li> Where has this been all my life? I&#x27;m vampiric in appearance and other BB creams have always been a touch too dark, but this works wonderfully. It does smell a bit like a new diaper, but that&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing and fades when it dries.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT; will buy again!!</li>
    <li> This bb cream is not full coverage, which is why I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars instead of 5. It evens out redness very well but doesn&#x27;t cover all the imperfections. I&#x27;ve used only bb cream, no foundation, for over a year. I find that most other bb creams leave my face oily and greasy. My skin is naturally dry/normal, so I&#x27;ve never experienced having to use oil blotting sheets or anything, until using bb cream. But I love the benefits of it so much that I dealt with it, using powder and blotting. This product is not oily AT ALL. I&#x27;ve been wearing it all day and it is still sitting very nicely. I should also mention that I&#x27;m a fair-skinned redhead, pale with freckles and pink undertones, and this is one of the only products I&#x27;ve ever found that is truly light enough to blend with my skin.    Con: I had to use (what felt like) a lot of product to get the coverage I wanted. Probably 5-6 small squeezes from the tube, after noticing that the coverage was minimal. Also, I have to put on a good amount of moisturizer before using this, otherwise it doesn&#x27;t spread that well. Overall, I like it and am going to stick with it - at least until I run out!  :)</li>
    <li> At first I was very excited to try this product.  I am very pale and do not have a product that won&#x27;t make me orange.  It went on well but really dried my face after a few hours.  It made lines on my face from my nose to my mouth very, very pronounced. I had never even noticed them before.  It looked so terrible I washed my face in the ladies room at work so I didn&#x27;t look like a puppet.</li>
    <li> This is a great BB Cream if you have dry, very pale skin.  I find that the color is very neutral, which is ideal for me.  If you have very warm/yellow skin, I probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend this BB cream, but it&#x27;s great for balancing out cool skin with redness.  I find the coverage to be light to medium and is *very* easily blendable and doesn&#x27;t cake up.  I&#x27;ve applied this using my hands, a brush and a beauty blender, and I prefer to use my hands.  If you have oily skin, you will want to set this with powder.  It has a satin/dewy finish, which is great for the dry winter time.  This BB cream does not irritate my skin and hasn&#x27;t made me break out.  The 20 grams is much smaller than I anticipated, but I&#x27;ll gladly repurchase the larger size as I really do enjoy this BB cream.  I still use a full coverage concealer for acne and under eye, but if you&#x27;re looking for a dewy, natural BB cream to even out your pale skin, this is highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This color is a bit off for my skin tone and if I order again, I will try a different shade. I like the SPF addition since my regular foundation is lacking sunscreen. Doesn&#x27;t really have a scent and coverage is light.</li>
    <li> I chose to try some BB cream as an alternative to foundation, but also wanted something more than a tinted moisturizer.  This goes on smoothly, but only with a clean face that has been adequately moisturized.  If there are any areas that are dry, this will show, so it requires it be applied well.  A little can go a long way and is light and smooth.  I don&#x27;t notice I&#x27;m wearing it, which is not the case when I wear regular foundation.  I apply this and then use a mineral product that reduces redness, followed by a basic face powder.  I also found the smell to be pleasant and light.  I recommend this product, even despite the higher price tag.</li>
    <li> Affordable, not too heavy, has the coverage I need. I&#x27;ve ordered this several times and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> I find this BB cream a tad light for my skin tone- I am very fair, but it is so wonderful! It has a greyish tint, which works wonder in covering blemishes and redness. It&#x27;s very moisturizing and blends well. I use it under my foundation, but if it matched my skin tone better I would wear it alone. Great product!</li>
    <li> Like so many of my fellow fair-skinned females, I&#x27;ve struggled all my life to find a makeup pale enough to match my skintone. Even the fairest products from every makeup company were too dark for me. After sifting through TONS of positive reviews all over the internet, I thought I&#x27;d bite the bullet and try Missha Perfect Cover BB Cream in #13 (Milky or \\&quot;Bright\\&quot; Beige). MAN, am I glad I did. Not only does it blend PERFECTLY with my super fair skin tone (I&#x27;m Caucasian, btw), it truly is a \\&quot;perfect cover\\&quot; with regard to redness, dark circles, etc. The biggest happy surprise was that, after only two uses, my usually red t-zone is no longer red. My skintone actually looks more even now--and that&#x27;s only after a matter of DAYS! It&#x27;s so weird to actually find a beauty product that does what it SAYS it does. Thus, I can say for sure that the whitening effect really does work. Not sure about the wrinkle remover aspect, however. That may take more time. What I CAN say is that this stuff makes my skin look like porcelain. I&#x27;m hooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: (Where to begin?) Great for super pale girls...but not TOO light for slightly darker girls. Perfect porcelain skin. Actually whitens typically red areas. Covers undereye circles beautifully. Great coverage. Doesn&#x27;t take much product at all. Etc. Etc. Etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: Ummmmm.......[thinking]..well, the smell is rather strong, as others have mentioned. Quite perfume-y. Can induce some oilyness if you&#x27;re prone to that. Ummm....................&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended....by someone who&#x27;s usually skeptical of such \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; products. It&#x27;s a miracle. I&#x27;m sold.</li>
    <li> Want the coverage of a light foundation with the benefits of a moisturizer? Want the spf coverage without the heavy feel and strong sunscreen smell? Missha BB cream is the answer! I was skeptical as to if this would live up to the hype and claims made by the company, and for me it has. Now, this isn&#x27;t a miracle product, but it has fulfilled the needs I have. Maintaining my skin is extremely important to me so spf is something I try to incorporate into my skin care regimen. However, having sensitive skin, finding a face sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t break me out is hard to find. This product works like a charm. It not only gives me the spf I crave but a lovely amount of coverage which is a fantastic base for my makeup. Some days I simply wear this and forgo foundation all together. A little bit goes a long way with this product so I believe it is definitely worth the money</li>
    <li> I like the high SPF in this product and the color blends beautifully. It does have a powdery smell that is pleasant, but something I&#x27;m not quite use to. It has medium coverage and great consistency. I don&#x27;t find that it is very long lasting. I&#x27;m combination skin type and I do find that I&#x27;m oily with this product. I did blot my face during the day and powdered again. I even wore it under a long lasting foundation and still felt some oil seeping through during the day. This would be a great product for those with dry skin or normal skin. It was very hydrating and leaves a satin finish. Missha is by far better than any US BB cream that I&#x27;ve tried and would recommend it to anyone wanting to try BB creams.</li>
    <li> I use MAC NW15 or NC15 concealer and this is a decent match for my skin, if not even more pale. I would certainly purchase this again, but I need to cut it with moisturizer because it&#x27;s a tad too thick on its own. To me, this is closer to a foundation than a BB cream. Then again, I like extremely light coverage, just a bit to even out my skintone. It&#x27;s also rather pricey for how small the tube is. Cut it with moisturizer and it&#x27;ll go a long way, but if you&#x27;re using a lot, don&#x27;t expect it to last long.</li>
    <li> I love this bb cream. It is my favorite dewy one. I&#x27;m the lightest drug store shade, I get Milky Beige in this. Its smells so fresh, but not overwhelming.</li>
    <li> A little on the light side, however, when mixed with another product, the color is better. I don&#x27;t think I will order again.</li>
    <li> I have tried a couple others and had problems with break outs.&lt;br /&gt;This leaves a dewy but not greasy finish. I have purchase their Boomer as well and no problems with break outs, not great as a pore minimizer, although very long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;The coverage of this BB cream is pretty decent, but it is not a foundation! I use it as it is simple and has great sunscreen protection. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about a week now and it covers nicely and matches my skintone well (I&#x27;m pale for a white American), but my biggest drawback is that I can clearly tell there is makeup on my face. I have relatively dry skin in autumn-winter and the cream only worsens it. Otherwise, it is excellent at covering pores.</li>
    <li> My wife didn&#x27;t expect the size to be so small. It definitely looks like sample size. She felt she had overpaid and regretted not reading carefully that it was only 20g.</li>
    <li> Honestly, the product itself is good.&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, you can find a better priced item (more than half cheaper than this), search 50ml for the same price.&lt;br /&gt;I made a mistake or ordering 2 of this for my first purchase, but just found out that there is a 50ml product for the same price 12.50.AND it is 5-6 dollars in Korea for 20ml one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using asain bb cream for many years, since about the 90s. Though I love them I&#x27;ve found the hardest time finding one that matches my skin shade. I&#x27;m extremely fair and makeup of most varieties are too dark for me, but this product actually matches very well. It goes on smooth, protects, hydrates, lightens my scars and provides quite full coverage for a bb cream. I&#x27;ll use it as a base for foundation or on the weekends by itself. Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product! Will definitely repurchase!</li>
    <li> What a great BB Cream!  I have tried a few including Dr. Jart, some american brands, Boscia... this one is the best so far.  More colors for everyone, I am particularly light skinned (lighter than NC15 Mac, lighter than any drugstore brand usually, lightest in Makeup Forever, one shade darker than white in Illamasqua... Missha no 13 is PERFECT for me and adjusts to my skintone perfectly... not too pink, not too yellow, not too grey.  The texture is nice, smooth, non-greasy, and dries to a nice glowy finish.  Not shiny, but not matte.  Seriously - I think I&#x27;m in love.  Oh - as far as fragrance - it has a slight smell similar to Shiseido \\&quot;the skincare\\&quot; - If you&#x27;re extremely sensitive, don&#x27;t do it... but I am pretty touchy when it comes to fragrance and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seoul Glamour ships incredibly fast and the packaging is awesome &lt;3  will definitely order again from them!! &lt;3</li>
    <li> Very light coverage that feels like nothing, and leaves skin feeling smooth and soft. I&#x27;m extremely fair-skinned, and this shade fit me wonderfully. It really goes on and feels great on your skin, and doesn&#x27;t leave a dewy finish.&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, one thing that is keeping me from loving this BB cream is the SMELL. It is extremely perfumed. It smells like an old-woman&#x27;s perfume. Actually it has the same smell as a scented tampon. I really hate the odor. It&#x27;s also really strong smelling, which is off-putting with a facial product. Just a heads-up to potential buyers. It&#x27;s a great BB cream. The smell just really disagrees with me personally.</li>
    <li> item arrived as promised. The texture is very good and the tone of the foundation is very pale. Coverage is light to medium. However, it does have a strong perfume smell which I personally do not mind, but others might. Like many others have said, this BB cream does not oxidize to be orange and is more for neutral skinned people. Overall, great product.</li>
    <li> I got this so I could try the shade out without buying the full sized bottle and I love it! I normally use Revlon&#x27;s Colorstay in Ivory and this shade is perfect for me. It&#x27;s a tad greasy, but I just set it with powder and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> i thought its a big bottle i regret to buy this product coz i buy before in cosmeticworld.com but its a big bottle its same price&lt;br /&gt;its really small bottle</li>
    <li> High quality product but not full coverage. Though it does smell nice, I believe that face products should be fragrance free.</li>
    <li> After years of searching for a solution for my pale skin i have finally found it! THANK YOU KOREA! I love it</li>
    <li> I love this bb cream. It comes in shades perfect for more pale people.  Great coverage and lasts throughout the day.</li>
    <li> As far as coverage goes, you need to wear more of this than I would have liked to. It does feel light. And the color is great. I also believe that it has helped my skin since I started using it. As far as tinted moisturizers go, for the price this is a good one.</li>
    <li> Great product! Its acually light enough for my pale-a$$ skin! I will be ordering more for sure. Its not as good as my Joeur, but its good.</li>
    <li> Amazing! I am very pale with a neutral undertone and this product matches my skin perfectly. It&#x27;s not too yellow or pink. It&#x27;s not too thick but still covers very very well and looks natural. I don&#x27;t think I have been more impressed with a makeup product before. I&#x27;m about to buy another one so I don&#x27;t ever have to go without it :)</li>
    <li> This is the second BB cream I&#x27;ve tried and is a clear winner. I wish I had a local source for it. I purchased the smaller size to try it. When I replace it I will get the larger size. I had read about this brand in several beauty blogs and was expecting it to appear one way and change over a few minutes as it adjusted to my skin. One blogger showed pictures of how gray it looks on her skin at first. For me it goes on easily and does not change drastically. It&#x27;s hardly noticeable. I have fair skin, normal, no real issues except that I&#x27;m not getting any younger. I use this for under-eye coverage as well.  I don&#x27;t have dark circles and it looks more natural than under-eye concealer. I got the #13 color and have found it to be a good fit for my skin tone which has pinkish undertones. It spreads easily. I&#x27;m really happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I really liked this BB Cream! The only problem was that with extended use it broke me out.  I was fine for a week using this product, but then I started to develop little red bumps around areas of my face where I had applied the BB Cream.  If you have sensitive skin, try it maybe... But if you don&#x27;t have sensitive issues then I say totally go for it! The scent is light and the coverage is great and smooth.</li>
