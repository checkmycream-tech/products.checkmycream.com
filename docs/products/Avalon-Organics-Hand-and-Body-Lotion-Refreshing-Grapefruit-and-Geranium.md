      <li>If you are OK with a very strong lemon scent then this is for you.</li>
      <li>and I think I finally found the closest thing to perfect.  </li>
      <li>I love this lotion.</li>

      <li>Great lotion, I like the smell of the natural herbs and fruit.</li>
      <li>I like the fresh lemon scent and it absorbs nicely into the skin.</li>
      <li>I am in love with this lotion, it feels very luxurious while putting it on and leaves a nice non greasy feel to skin.</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t beat the natural ingredients, the smell is really nice, and I especially enjoyed the pump feature on this bottle rather than the regular capped ones.</li>
      <li>Smells nice, seems pretty moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>But thankfully the lotion itself smells lovely and does a great job of moisturizing dry skin.</li>
      <li>Its silky smooth and spreads evenly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really a shame, cuz it smells so good at first.</li>
      <li>Rich without being greasy.  </li>
      <li>It has a rich texture and feel.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell when I put it on - not overpowering like so many lotions, and believe me I&#x27;m sensitive.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many organic lotions and this is by far my favorite.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a light lemon scent that goes away quickly.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Totally worth the relatively high price for the low toxicity and awesome scent.</li>
      <li>Nice lemony scent and doesn&#x27;t leave my hands feeling sticky - just soft.  </li>
      <li>lemon is fresh and clean smell without all the perfume odor.</li>
      <li>The lotion soaks in fast and leaves you smooth and lemony.</li>
      <li>Love that it&#x27;s all organic and natural.</li>
      <li>the scent of lemons is just right</li>
      <li>Also saw some reviews that said the product has been watered down and is no longer as good as it used to be.</li>
      <li>It comes with the pump dispenser taped up so no leakage can occur, as it did when I first started mail-ordering it.</li>
      <li>This lotion continues to be my favorite for daily use.</li>
      <li>First tried this lotion at a vacation home in Colorado</li>
      <li>I want a lotion with substance, which is why I&#x27;m wearing it in the first place.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to need a good dollop when my hands are all dried out from doin</li>
      <li>I really like this lemon lotion because of the natural ingredients and the smooth way it goes on the skin.</li>
      <li>I hate anything perfume, but this is just a nice, crisp lemon scent and a great moisturizer too.</li>
      <li>Very lemony.</li>
      <li>Moisturizes very well.</li>
      <li>I really like these items</li>
      <li>Do not like the lavender scent as much.</li>
      <li>A real treat for the senses.</li>
      <li>Shipped fast.</li>
      <li>And the scent is divine, better than anything I have found previously in stores.</li>
      <li>Admittedly I often buy lotion because I like the packaging - particularly when the bottle will be sitting out where guests can see it.</li>
      <li>If so, I am sorry I missed out on the \\&quot;better\\&quot; product because this one (as it is now) is great.</li>
      <li>Love all Avalon products and the fact they&#x27;re green and organic.</li>
      <li>immediately absorbed by skin but stays silky, not oily on computer keys; since I do not like going in public with heavy odors (and am allergic to perfumes) this is the perfect product for a subtle, natural odor!</li>
      <li>but since it&#x27;s new and improved I don&#x27;t know.</li>
      <li>always like to try new stuff....</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also rated very well by Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Skin Deep rating system.</li>
      <li>The scent is lightly citrusy - not really my favorite</li>
      <li>Walmart used to carry this scent but now only the Lavender is available in stores (at least where I live).</li>
      <li>Only complaint is that when you get to the bottom, it gets too rich to pump.</li>
      <li>My hands always feel so soft afterwards and the effects last for a very long time.</li>

    <li> I got this as a Christmas gift after asking for Lemon hand lotion which is very tough to find. I am in love with this lotion, it feels very luxurious while putting it on and leaves a nice non greasy feel to skin. And the scent is divine, better than anything I have found previously in stores.</li>
    <li> My wife had been using some &amp;#34;peach&amp;#34; scented Kiss My Face stuff but people say it smells like cat pee. That stuff is too strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS STUFF however smells great. Like someone just raked their fingernails across a meyer lemon and dangled them in front of my nose. It&#x27;s also rated very well by Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Skin Deep rating system. It doesn&#x27;t leave me greasy at all, but nice and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to need a good dollop when my hands are all dried out from doin all the dishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally worth the relatively high price for the low toxicity and awesome scent.</li>
    <li> Good but  not my favorite.......Lemon Body Lotion 12 Ounces.......always like to try new stuff....nice smelling!~....I would not buy again......have found othersI like better!~</li>
    <li> Very good hand lotion.  Rich without being greasy.  Only complaint is that when you get to the bottom, it gets too rich to pump.</li>
    <li> Smells just like lemon headsn</li>
    <li> I really like this lemon lotion because of the natural ingredients and the smooth way it goes on the skin. It has a rich texture and feel.  Although I do not like greasy lotion&#x27;s, I also do not like lotions that are so thin and watery that feels like I&#x27;m wearing nothing.  I want a lotion with substance, which is why I&#x27;m wearing it in the first place.  I also like the lemony smell, which although not overpowering, it&#x27;s still refreshingly there.  And its a natural smelling lemon, which is hard to find in lemon lotions.  Also, no parabens in this lotion, and that is a big plus!</li>
    <li> Was looking for a lotion that didn&#x27;t have all the harmful chemicals you hear about on the news.  This one is perfect.  Nice lemony scent and doesn&#x27;t leave my hands feeling sticky - just soft.  Will def. buy again!</li>
    <li> Shipped fast. I have used thsi for 2 years. The lemon scent is so delicious. The lotion soaks in fast and leaves you smooth and lemony.</li>
    <li> This lotion continues to be my favorite for daily use. I like the fresh lemon scent and it absorbs nicely into the skin. Walmart used to carry this scent but now only the Lavender is available in stores (at least where I live). Do not like the lavender scent as much. Good buy. It comes with the pump dispenser taped up so no leakage can occur, as it did when I first started mail-ordering it.</li>
    <li> If you are OK with a very strong lemon scent then this is for you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many organic lotions and this is by far my favorite. the scent of lemons is just right and it is not overpowering. it&#x27;s a light lemon scent that goes away quickly. Moisturizes very well.</li>
    <li> Great lotion, I like the smell of the natural herbs and fruit.</li>
    <li> I use it to repel mosquitoes - and it works for about 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Smells great!</li>
    <li> Smells nice, seems pretty moisturizing.  Love that it&#x27;s all organic and natural.</li>
    <li> Love all Avalon products and the fact they&#x27;re green and organic.</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite since I discovered it years ago! I just wish they made it in Orange Blossom!</li>
    <li> Not greasy. Very lemony. Combined with the rosemary lotion, I have no mosquito bites! I like it.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! It smells wonderful, so lemony! A real treat for the senses.</li>
    <li> For my Daughter in Law.  She loves it!</li>
    <li> I hate anything perfume, but this is just a nice, crisp lemon scent and a great moisturizer too.</li>
    <li> Really love everything about this soap. Effective, pleasant to use, washes off well, great lemon scent. Pump works great.  Elegant bottle. Would look good in any bathroom or kitchen counter. Saw some reviews that said the pump did not work well but have had no issues with that. Also saw some reviews that said the product has been watered down and is no longer as good as it used to be. If so, I am sorry I missed out on the \\&quot;better\\&quot; product because this one (as it is now) is great.</li>
    <li> This must have been a bad batch, because the smell was putrid! Normally I love this product. I guess there is a bad apple (lemon in this case) occasionally.</li>
    <li> Love the unscented and grapeseed lotions from Avalon but hate the lemon! Smells like lemon drops, not real lemon. Also, annoyed that the packaging has extra sticker from amazon and that&#x27;s the bottle has non removable sticker that says &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; on it since I leave out in kitchen.</li>
    <li> I really liked this lotion. You can&#x27;t beat the natural ingredients, the smell is really nice, and I especially enjoyed the pump feature on this bottle rather than the regular capped ones. That way you don&#x27;t have to keep picking it up with lotion on your hands to get more. I will be getting again!</li>
    <li> I really like these items I only have one complaint that is that I only wanted 1 bath wash and it kept taking it out unless I ordered 2 so I ordered 2 just so &amp;#62; could try these items I ordered lotion too but I do like the products may be somebody needs to look at that just in case someone else doesn&#x27;t have the money to order 2 it was over 10 dollars for shipping now that&#x27;s crazy</li>
    <li> Admittedly I often buy lotion because I like the packaging - particularly when the bottle will be sitting out where guests can see it. I purchased this bottle of Avalon Organics Lemon Body Lotion because the green tinted bottle and yellow graphics match my earth toned kitchen. But thankfully the lotion itself smells lovely and does a great job of moisturizing dry skin. I usually apply a small pump of this to my hands just as I&#x27;m heading out the door or after I clean the kitchen. My hands always feel so soft afterwards and the effects last for a very long time. Even my husband loves this stuff. The scent is lightly citrusy - not really my favorite but it&#x27;s not off-putting. A little pricey when purchased online, but it&#x27;s hard to find in stores in my area, so I deal. Overall a satisfactory purchase.</li>
    <li> I have allergies and Avalon Organics is just the lotion to have.&lt;br /&gt;The lemon is fresh and clean smell without all the perfume odor.</li>
    <li> immediately absorbed by skin but stays silky, not oily on computer keys; since I do not like going in public with heavy odors (and am allergic to perfumes) this is the perfect product for a subtle, natural odor! I will be ordering more for Christmas presents!</li>
    <li> Not more sustainable as advertized and does not make my skin feel as soft as before .

I&#x27;m disappointed because I waited to long to find a retailer. I ordered this product from you before and was very pleased but since it&#x27;s new and improved I don&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> love it it smells great i have bought it before</li>
    <li> I love the smell when I put it on - not overpowering like so many lotions, and believe me I&#x27;m sensitive. Problem is, the aroma is totally gone within an hour. It&#x27;s really a shame, cuz it smells so good at first.</li>
    <li> Great cream and scent!</li>
    <li> I have to admit that I am a lotion junkie...OK some may say hoarder.  It is so hard to find the right lotion.  One that moisturizes without leaving a greasy feeling.  One that has lasting power but doesn&#x27;t repel water when you wash your hands.  One that smells good but isn&#x27;t under or over powering.  I&#x27;ve searched long and hard and I think I finally found the closest thing to perfect.  I LOVE this stuff!</li>
    <li> First tried this lotion at a vacation home in Colorado and I had to have some....Wonderful scent, great moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. Its silky smooth and spreads evenly.</li>
