<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Bought this product to test it out with Bare Minerals foundation because I have very bad rosacea.  I love it.  Very mild on skin and helps the foundation blend and stick so much better.</li>
    <li> I like the Bare Minerals make up.  I was really disappointed in the size of this container for the price.  I really thought it would be bigger than the size in the sample kit.</li>
    <li> There is no color it is a clear gel</li>
    <li> Tiny amnt. But love the way it feels on my face.</li>
    <li> Great way to start the day just before you apply Bare Minerals foundation.</li>
    <li> I looked at the shipping weight and thought it was bigger rather than the .5 size, so I wasn&#x27;t too happy when I got it. The product is fine. I&#x27;ve used it before.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin,so I normally just use Bare Minerals makeup,and I had to purchase this because the one that came in my Bare Minerals kit ran out before everything else. I tried a different primer just before(because Bare Minerals products are amazing yet pricey), but it just wouldn&#x27;t work for me. This product is the exact same as the one I bought from the Bare Minerals store, and I love that it is available for purchase in this smaller size rather than the larger one with the pump (which is horrible compared to the actual product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This primer goes on smoothly and dries/gets absorbed into your skin almost instantly. In the beginning, I would often forget where I applied the primer,because you just don&#x27;t feel it on your skin. Love this, and would purchase again if I run out.</li>
    <li> So soft and creates a great base for the mineral powder!</li>
    <li> Very small I thought it would be bigger! The shipping was very fast though</li>
    <li> Smaller than I wouldn&#x27;t dissipated</li>
    <li> Small size..enough to sample for a week..</li>
    <li> Super small product,less than anticipated,more like sample size. Boxed like it was a huge tube.Sort of a waste of&lt;br /&gt; a box.</li>
    <li> Best make up primer! It goes on very smooth and moisturizes too. Keeps my makeup looking perfect all day. I use it when I have to work a long day and don&#x27;t want to touch up. A little bit on the small size but a little goes a long way</li>
    <li> Very smooth on the skin</li>
    <li> Prime Time does what it&#x27;s suppose to do but is over priced in my opinion. I only use bare minerals foundation products on my face but this one is. a. pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;E.L.F. Primer works better for a fraction of the price. Try that instead!</li>
    <li> This product makes applying your foundation really, really smooth. If you use expensive base then this will allow you  to use much less, as it goes on so smoothly. Great product!</li>
    <li> I have no complains on this product, it always does the job.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product. It feels like putting silk on your face and is a good primer before applying  mineral makeup.&lt;br /&gt;Fast service. Packing was good. Would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> really makes a difference inhow your powder goes on and stays on all day!!</li>
    <li> Love this so far. Only used it once but it was great.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product and it let me down......I will not buy this item again.</li>
    <li> This products works but smells a little bit funny. The smell is not too terrible but it is noticeable when first applied. I like the way it feels on my skin and it looks great.</li>
    <li> Very nice. Small package (about 3 inches). Goes on easy; it is kind of sticky/goopy but once you rub it in your palm and apply it is smooth and keeps makeup on all day long.</li>
    <li> Not the same as described  was very tiny for the money</li>
    <li> Bare Minerals is the best product by far.....</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t help bare minerals pressed powder foundation to go on smoothly at all. My Clinique lotion worked about as well. Back it went. Not a fan of bare minerals anymore, except for lip glosses.</li>
    <li> So i do really like bare minerals primers but l think the one with oil control works a lot better. The small size is just to small. I would reccomed the full size. I have been using the bare minerals primer for 2 years and havent had any problems with it irratating my acne prone sensitive skin like others. The regular size will last me 6 months. This is looking like it will only last 1 month.</li>
    <li> Prime time is a great base for your minerals make up.</li>
    <li> Makeup applies so easily on top of this. I was also concerned about the ingredients ---too good to be true? Nope. I checked with the Environmental Working Group and the ingredients scored very well! Only downside---pretty expensive considering the size,</li>
    <li> Spreads easily. A tiny dab goes a long ways. Makes your skin feel smooth and soft. The tube is extremely small, but the product lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It makes my skin feel like silk and my Bare Minerals make-up goes on smoothly.</li>
    <li> For $12 it is too small, but the product itself is pretty good and I will be purchasing the full size product</li>
    <li> It works very well with my morning ritual with my favorite make up products in the whole wide world. Won&#x27;t leave home with it!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. It feels like silk going on, and makes the Bare Minerals foundation look very smooth and luminous. I can&#x27;t live without it. It makes your face look like it was airbrushed. It is an odd texture, silky, but not at all oily.</li>
    <li> beware of the size i didn&#x27;t really look that carefully but it is tiny... and honestly i could have done without this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I don&#x27;t know what I ever did without it.</li>
    <li> However this tube exploded in the mail...</li>
    <li> Already knew it was going to be small but you only need a small dab and it will cover your whole face!</li>
    <li> So, my experience with Bare Minerals is this: less is ALWAYS more.  So while their products can be pricey at times, they are meant to last a long time.  I wanted to try out the primer without splurging for the entire bottle.  When this arrives, it looks TINY, but since all you need is a pea-sized drop, this little bottle actually lasts a long time.  I ended up ordering another one for travel purposes.  One tiny drop smooths over your skin VERY nicely, and has no scent or greasy feel too it.  You will need to allow about 5-10 minutes to let it dry completely before starting with the rest of your make-up routine.  It will help your make-up glide on, and give it a nice natural finish once it sets.  It also helps seal in the moisture that comes from Bare Minerals.</li>
    <li> This is a clear gel and when you use it about the size of a large pea is enough.  I provides a nice very soft feeling to your face it does help the &amp;#34;Bare Escentuals&amp;#34; makeup to last longer I have found.</li>
    <li> This primer is great unless you have problem skin. I found it hard to get my creamy concealer to stay on my skin. So, if you&#x27;re just looking for a smooth finish, go for it! But if you&#x27;re looking for good staying power with liquid makeup, go elsewhere!</li>
    <li> really like the texture,</li>
    <li> Much smaller size then I thought</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just started using it.  I have dry skin and so I think I need to apply more.&lt;br /&gt;It feels very good on the face.  It&#x27;s very expensive for such a tiny tube.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do what I expected.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great to be able to get products you love when deployed.  Thanks Bare Minerals and Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> Love it, will never use anything else.Makes your skin soft and it&#x27;s not greasy and your makeup&lt;br /&gt;slides right on.You&#x27;ll use less make up too. It makes you look flawless. Gotta love that,right. :)</li>
    <li> VERY SMALL BOTTLE.  I should have been more tuned in to the size.</li>
    <li> omg this is the most amazing stuff ever !! it really does make ur makeup glide on so smooth lol honestly sometimes i just put it on my face to put it on my face lmao it feels really nice nd makes ur skin feel flawless nd very smooth</li>
    <li> This was an inexpensive way to buy a product that I already use.  I even gave some to my daughter.</li>
    <li> I have large pores, very sensitive skin &amp; splotchy complexion due to acne.  This is the first product that made my skin smooth enough to apply mineral or liquid foundation easily and it does not cause my skin to break out further.  Everything else I&#x27;ve tried over the years made my complexion worse,even if it did cover, I could not use. I think they finally got it &amp;#34;Right&amp;#34; with this Prime Time &amp; hope you love it as much as I do! Buying it online is so much more reasonable than at the stores, I must add, and so convenient. Thanks for the excellent product &amp; great delivery.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and great product! Easy to use and keeps your makeup on all day long. I  would recommend this product to everyone!</li>
    <li> This is not a product that I will continue to use because I didn&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
    <li> I expected a tint to this, because my other one has a tint. It&#x27;s clear but works really well. Keeps the oil at bay and lasts all day (hmm, that could be a branding line)!</li>
    <li> I thought it was a bigger tube</li>
    <li> It feels just like primers do. I don&#x27;t use foundation so can&#x27;t wait to try it with that but I do use it with BB cream and set with powder and have not seen any crazy make-up sinking into my pores as liquid often does. So far it is working great, will update if I find a foundation I like for my pale skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The primer is clear of course and very smooth feeling so a little goes a long way. Picture was at the end of a 17 hour day wearing it and my first time trying White castle!</li>
    <li> Came super super fast. I have used this product before and love it. It&#x27;s very light weight and doesn&#x27;t make my face feel greasy.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this line of products and they do make her look more natural and less makeupy if that is a word.</li>
    <li> Makes my makeup last all day! A little goes a long way. Great product!</li>
    <li> I like the product but for the price, I didn&#x27;t realize this was SO SMALL.  I have purchased before and it was much larger bottle.  This small bottle is not worth 15 dollars.  Product is fine.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way! You only need a very small amount so this tube will last long. It smoothens my skin and makes my foundation last longer! I love it!</li>
    <li> Completely useless! Prime Time generally is color &amp; clarity of Vaseline. This was clear &amp; oily. It didn&#x27;t dry &amp; was there useless as foundation primer. This was not like any other &amp;#34;Prime Time&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve ever encountered. I would give it 0 stars if that were possible!</li>
    <li> Works great. Feels great.</li>
    <li> great under foundations!!</li>
    <li> I love the look and feel after using it!</li>
    <li> Even with this primer mineral makeup doesn&#x27;t work for me. It still looks chalky and unnatural.I prefer to go as natural as possible.</li>
    <li> The bottle of this primer is extremely small but it only takes a tiny amount to cover your entire face. It leaves your face feeling so smooth and makeup, whether it&#x27;s mineral or a liquid, glides on effortlessly. Now, as far as the ability for staying power for my foundation .... I have used other primers that were way more inexpensive that held my foundation on for a lot longer but this one is a really good product. I am only giving 4 stars due to sizing and price and inability to keep my foundation on all day.</li>
    <li> This leaves my skin smooth.</li>
    <li> Feels natural and light. Will definitely buy more</li>
    <li> This is a great primer and helps the makeup to go on really smooth.  Always get compliments from my beautician</li>
    <li> I love everything Bare Minerals! Just wish I would have purchased a bigger tube. Guess I have to go to the Bare Minerals store.:-(</li>
    <li> Awesome! Totally worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I recieved this in a trial size with Bare Minerals Foundation. My only real problem areas are my dark circles and a little redness in my t-zone, but not much. The primer does make my skin feel super soft right after putting it on. But I don&#x27;t see a difference in my finished face if I use it or not. I do have sensative skin, to he point that every face wash I have ever tried always breaks me out. So I quit trying them and I stick to just warm water and a wash cloth. My face stays clear, even if I forget to wash Bare Minerals off. However I found that if I use the primer a few days in a row, I break out. And since I can&#x27;t tell a difference, I don&#x27;t use it, and I definately don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth buying.</li>
    <li> I usually use Tarte but decided to try this primer.  It made my face feel oily and my makeup look shiny.</li>
    <li> Was not exactly what I expected, it was much smaller then I had thought. All OK with delivery</li>
    <li> Great product. Helps makeup go on smoothly. I recommend using an exfoliator before.</li>
</ol>
