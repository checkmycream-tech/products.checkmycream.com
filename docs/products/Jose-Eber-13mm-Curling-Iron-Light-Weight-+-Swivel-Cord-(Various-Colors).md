      <li>:) she&#x27;s gonna love it</li>
      <li>felt like I just came from the salon when my hair was done :)</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>So I was so excited to find it on Amazon for under $40!</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s totally true!</li>
      <li>The swivel cord allows it to move easily and not get tangled.</li>
      <li>I used a pick to separate them, a very light dusting of hair spray and a quick scrunch</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worth the expense!</li>
      <li>:)  Thanks!</li>
      <li>The 13mm makes beautiful curls, but they are TIGHT (Shirley Temple-esque) curls.</li>
      <li>I love this product, very easy to use, the curls last a good few days.  </li>
      <li>Gets hot in seconds!</li>
      <li>It took a while to get the hang of using it -- and the process is time-consuming, but the results are well worth it.  </li>
      <li>it curl my hair fast and you will love it fast .</li>
      <li>My daughter has very long hair, and it was quick and easy to use this rod to curl it!</li>
      <li>If you want great curls that will last a day and the next if you don&#x27;t wash it out</li>
      <li>It was very easy and the spiral curls were soft, glossy and looked very natural.  </li>
      <li>It gets really hot and gives consistant even heat throught use, no need for a temperature dial.</li>
      <li>it is my first time I curl my hair by myself and at the party</li>
      <li>I love the curl pattern that this iron makes which is a lot different than how a curling iron with a clip curls your hair.  </li>
      <li>I would most definitely recommend it to all my friends.</li>
      <li>The iron heats up within 30 seconds and it gets extremely hot (be careful not to burn yourself, which is very easy to do)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s incredibly hot and you run a real risk of burning yourself while you learn to use it.  </li>
      <li>It does exactly what you want and does it fast.</li>
      <li>i totally think it is worth it becasue the curls last all day and my hair looks so cute.  </li>
      <li>but really didn&#x27;t want to spend that much.  </li>
      <li>it heats up fast</li>
      <li>I was concerned the small size (13mm) was going to make my curls too tight, but they are the perfect size and they look natural.  </li>
      <li>You will love this curling iron, they are not like the typical curling iron you will buy from the store.</li>
      <li>My mom purchase this exact iron from our local mall for $100.00 for my sister and was bummed when i told her how much i paid for it!  </li>
      <li>the curl is shiny and lasting, so overall 2 thumbs up from me :-)</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this curling iron -- go for it --</li>
      <li>i would highly recommend using the glove provided.</li>
      <li>I highly Recommed this product.</li>
      <li>I feel this curling iron works just as great as the one you can purchase in the shopping mall and this one costs less than half of the mall curling iron.</li>
      <li>It is the same exact product and</li>
      <li>I have thin, fine, straight hair and bought it because I wanted a different look occasionally -- and more volume.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing since my hair is resistant to curling and the curls generally fall flat in a few hours.  </li>
      <li>the temperature is a fixed temperature meaning you can&#x27;t change the setting.  </li>
      <li>I found this one on amazon and it is worth every penny i spent.  </li>
      <li>This product arrived early then expected, considering I live in New Zealand!</li>
      <li>I find this new one produces longer lasting results and is easier to use once you get used to it -- and the swivel cord is a godsend -- no twisting and tangling to deal with.      </li>
      <li>Had this for a few months now, got it quickly and it works like a dream.  </li>
      <li>There is only one heat level and there is no auto-off as far as I can tell.  </li>
      <li>The curls were not loose curls at all.</li>
      <li>I like the small one versus the larger curling iron I have because the curls seem to last much longer!!!</li>
      <li>I really liked this product however I was disappointed to find out that I paid twice a much as it retails for.</li>
      <li>and i have stick straight super thin hair!</li>
      <li>This curling iron will put curls into my fine, thin hair that last for a day or even two.  </li>

<li> after finally using it i realized that it is a lot quicker since i dont have to be careful about burning my self because the glove&#x27;s got me covered.  </li>
<li> each hair type held the curl for a long time.  </li>
<li> the only issue one might encounter is to be careful not to burn yourself, as you need to use both hands to create the curl as ther is no clip to hold it in place.</li>
<li> You can make them tighter or looser based on how long you hold your hair over the roller.  </li>
<li> but you need to buy a heat protecter for your hair to apply it before you use the curling iron and Moisturizing cream to apply it after because the curling iron leave your hair dry  VERY dry .</li>
<li> But, be careful...</li>
<li> A plus to having a curling iron without a clamp is that you can get extremely close to your head which gives lots of volume and bounce.  </li>
<li> If you use a small section to curl it only takes a maximum of 5 seconds for the hair to curl.  </li>
<li> Ditto on the other reviews</li>
<li> my hair is just past my lower back and curls never stay in my hair until i tried the one my mom purchased.  </li>
<li> So it loses a star for no safety features, but it does a terrific job.  </li>
<li> My daughter has unpredictably wavy hair and was a flat iron fanatic.  </li>
<li> I was so sick of the straight look and needed to try something else, this definitely did the trick!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> The curl is so tight that it doesnt fall or need hair spray.</li>
<li> it takes a little getting used to.</li>
<li> It works well on clients that have thin unruley hair and wont hold curl with a larger Iron.</li>
<li> It was a life saver in a few situtations.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is an amazing curling iron!! I bought this because i heard that it&#x27;s easier to use than one with a clam and it&#x27;s totally true! The iron heats up within 30 seconds and it gets extremely hot (be careful not to burn yourself, which is very easy to do) the temperature is a fixed temperature meaning you can&#x27;t change the setting.  I prefer this because you dont have to fuss with finding a temperature that you think will work.  If you use a small section to curl it only takes a maximum of 5 seconds for the hair to curl.  I have tried this on different types of hair and each hair type held the curl for a long time.  The curl is so tight that it doesnt fall or need hair spray. The swivel cord allows it to move easily and not get tangled. A plus to having a curling iron without a clamp is that you can get extremely close to your head which gives lots of volume and bounce.  One of the best purchases I have ever made, highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> I really liked this product however I was disappointed to find out that I paid twice a much as it retails for. The actual price listed in the packaging of this product is $14.99....but any way it is still a great curling iron. Its heats up fast and it works great. I love the curl pattern that this iron makes which is a lot different than how a curling iron with a clip curls your hair.  The only thing is that it doesn&#x27;t have is a heat control setting on it.</li>
    <li> My mom purchase this exact iron from our local mall for $100.00 for my sister and was bummed when i told her how much i paid for it!  :)  I used the one my mom purchased and loved the result...my hair is just past my lower back and curls never stay in my hair until i tried the one my mom purchased.  I knew i had to have one but could not get my self to pay $100.00 for one iron. so i searched and found this one and the 25mm one and ended up paying $100.00.  i totally think it is worth it becasue the curls last all day and my hair looks so cute.  i always get compliments everywhere i go. i would highly recommend using the glove provided. i burnt my self 4x for being stubborn and not wanting to use the glove.  after finally using it i realized that it is a lot quicker since i dont have to be careful about burning my self because the glove&#x27;s got me covered.  :)  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I received my Jose Eber curling iron just days after ordering and love it!  I have the larger Jose Eber curling iron just like this that I bought from the mall and it cost me (after negotioting down-believe it or not) close to $100 dollars. My sister has this small iron I just bought and hers cost her $100 too!!! So I was so excited to find it on Amazon for under $40! It is the same exact product and the curls are great! You can make them tighter or looser based on how long you hold your hair over the roller.  I like the small one versus the larger curling iron I have because the curls seem to last much longer!!! :) very happy.</li>
    <li> I feel this curling iron works just as great as the one you can purchase in the shopping mall and this one costs less than half of the mall curling iron.</li>
    <li> I love the Jose Eber Curling iron, it is by far the best curling iron I have used. If you want proper curls that last! the only issue one might encounter is to be careful not to burn yourself, as you need to use both hands to create the curl as ther is no clip to hold it in place. The glove provided keeps your hands safe, but if you switch hands and are not used to it it couls happen. I have no issues though as I have 2 gloves and personally prefer not to have the clip that can make additional unsightly creases. the curl is shiny and lasting, so overall 2 thumbs up from me :-)</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this product and it was in great condition.</li>
    <li> This curling iron will put curls into my fine, thin hair that last for a day or even two.  It&#x27;s amazing since my hair is resistant to curling and the curls generally fall flat in a few hours.  It&#x27;s incredibly hot and you run a real risk of burning yourself while you learn to use it.  There is only one heat level and there is no auto-off as far as I can tell.  I am frankly a little scared of it because I really don&#x27;t want to burn the house down for the sake of stupid vanity.  So it loses a star for no safety features, but it does a terrific job.  Mine came with a heat resistant glove (similar to an exfoliating glove) that helps, but is kind of awkward and I don&#x27;t usually use it because it grabs my hair like velcro.</li>
    <li> This is a great item to use when styling hair. The fact that there is no clamp makes it a lot easier when styling for your own hair!</li>
    <li> this curling iron works great. It does exactly what you want and does it fast. But, be careful...it takes a little getting used to.</li>
    <li> I bought this iron because I LOVE my 25 mm Jose eber, and this one is just as great! It works well on clients that have thin unruley hair and wont hold curl with a larger Iron. It was a life saver in a few situtations. It gets really hot and gives consistant even heat throught use, no need for a temperature dial. Definately thankful I went ahead and got this one! AND IT WAS WAYYYYY CHEAPER THAN BUYING FROM THE JOSE EBER WEBSITE!!</li>
    <li> I was very excited to receive this curling iron, I read so many wonderful reviews.  After using this iron I was hooked.  It was very easy and the spiral curls were soft, glossy and looked very natural.  I would highly recommend this iron, you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Works great love it! Warms up quickly and is a great deal for the money!</li>
    <li> Gets hot in seconds! and does an amazing job, very happy customer here !</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve never had an easier iron to use, nor have i ever had such wonder results.  The curls stay to the next day and i have stick straight super thin hair!</li>
    <li> If you want great curls that will last a day and the next if you don&#x27;t wash it out this is the curling iron for you.  I love this kind of curling iron.  My mom bought one during Christmas at the mall for over 100.00, i wanted one but really didn&#x27;t want to spend that much.  I found this one on amazon and it is worth every penny i spent.  Now i want to buy the bigger size also.  You will love this curling iron, they are not like the typical curling iron you will buy from the store.</li>
    <li> Fabulous curls, just what I wanted, great product I would most definitely recommend it to all my friends. You get what you pay for...</li>
    <li> I bought this iron for my daughter who is in show choir. What use to take her 2 hours to do her hair for the show now only takes 15-20 minutes! She loves it! The curls are beautiful and they hold, even through 2 hour performances. AMAZING!</li>
    <li> I had ordered another curling rod and the review stated it was tapered.  This rod is NOT tapered.  It gets very hot, but it produces awesome results!  My daughter has very long hair, and it was quick and easy to use this rod to curl it!</li>
    <li> Ditto on the other reviews - I am SO glad I decided to buy this curling iron!  I have thin, fine, straight hair and bought it because I wanted a different look occasionally -- and more volume.  It took a while to get the hang of using it -- and the process is time-consuming, but the results are well worth it.  I was concerned the small size (13mm) was going to make my curls too tight, but they are the perfect size and they look natural.  I used a pick to separate them, a very light dusting of hair spray and a quick scrunch and they lasted all day and into the next. I LOVE how my hair looks and feels -- the curls are gorgeous! I definitely got the look I was after -- and some nice compliments as well.       FYI, I have another style spiral curler that has a spring clamp and ridges that wind around it to guide your hair into a spiral.  I find this new one produces longer lasting results and is easier to use once you get used to it -- and the swivel cord is a godsend -- no twisting and tangling to deal with.      I would highly recommend this curling iron -- go for it -- it&#x27;s worth the expense!</li>
    <li> Had this for a few months now, got it quickly and it works like a dream.  My daughter has unpredictably wavy hair and was a flat iron fanatic.  Now if the weather is crappy she will use this which gives her beautiful \\&quot;Taylor Swift\\&quot; hair - even from stick straight.  And the curls go to waves and last for days so she is not constantly frying her hair.  Price was great too!!</li>
    <li> Everything is wonderful</li>
    <li> If you are looking for tiny victorian curls, you must get this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;My hair was BEAUTIFUL and lasted 3 days without hair spray. I was so sick of the straight look and needed to try something else, this definitely did the trick!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I felt like I just came from the salon when my hair was done :)</li>
    <li> I loved it . it heats up fast it curl my hair fast and you will love it fast . it is my first time I curl my hair by myself and at the party some of the girls thought that I went to a hair salon . but you need to buy a heat protecter for your hair to apply it before you use the curling iron and Moisturizing cream to apply it after because the curling iron leave your hair dry  VERY dry .</li>
    <li> This curling iron is amazing. The only downside was that I didn&#x27;t read the description properly and bought the 13mm instead of the 19mm. The 13mm makes beautiful curls, but they are TIGHT (Shirley Temple-esque) curls. I used my friend&#x27;s 19mm one before and it was thicker so made looser curls. I&#x27;ll still keep the 13mm anyway!</li>
    <li> Christmas gift for my girlfriend. :) she&#x27;s gonna love it</li>
    <li> This product did not work well with my hair at all. The curls were not loose curls at all. I was disappointed with the curling wand.</li>
    <li> This product arrived early then expected, considering I live in New Zealand! I love this product, very easy to use, the curls last a good few days.  I highly Recommed this product.</li>
    <li> Just what my daughter wanted for Christmas!  It is just like the one her roommate has used to curl her hair and works great and is easy to use.</li>
