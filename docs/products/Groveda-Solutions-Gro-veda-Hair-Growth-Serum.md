<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using the oil for almost four weeks and have not seen any hair growth. It made my hair softer but that is all that it has done for me.</li>
    <li> Really good I will recommend this Product to everyone.</li>
    <li> This seems to be working well on growth. I used to use Gro-Aut oil but my hair plateaued at shoulder length. Couldn&#x27;t see significant growth once I got to shoulder length. Liquid Gold worked good too but they changed the formulation and it smells too much like sulfur now. It also just sits on the scalp now and doesn&#x27;t sink into skin. Have been using this for three weeks now and I do have noticeable growth. The top is growing like wildflower but the back is slow to grow. Maybe my back just grows slower than other sections. I cut my hair terribly so I&#x27;m evening the front to back so it&#x27;s working good for what I need. But again, slow growth on the back with excellent growth on my sides and crown. Will purchase again. Also, my edges are Rediculous!!! I never had edge problems but now the hairs on my edges are growing into spiral curls. So DOPE!</li>
    <li> Living in the midwest an our extremely cold weather dries your hair out an breaks off easily and with these wonderful products an the fastgro hair growth oil especially, has strengthened my hair, the shine it has is wonderful besides smelling great an not looking dry is great to see an the compliment&#x27;s i get is a great feeling. I also color my hair an it grow&#x27;s about 3/4 ths of an inch a month an has gotten much thicker also.  I thank you again for creating such a wonderful product.  I&#x27;ve used Wen hair product&#x27;s an never had this kind of results. Looking forward to your new face  an skin care product&#x27;s also. No matter what age these hair product&#x27;s improve your hair..my granddaughter uses them an now my grandson has taken my bottles of shampoo an conditioner for his hair.  It just goes to show men or women, young or old your products are terrific..I have a new head of hair for life thanks to you...Bless you</li>
    <li> i have finish this bottle in my hair and have not seen any results in it totally disappointed would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any sign of improvement!.  May when taken longer!?</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try product</li>
    <li> The product worked, as far as growing your hair, however, it burned my scalp causing bumps and sores.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for the hair, it does what it says. My hair is growing in all the right places Thanks....</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I have been using less than a week and have noticed some growth already and my hair is very soft and shiny it makes my brush go right through my hair without pulling on knots.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This stuff really works!! I love it my hair was up to my shoulder and with using just 2 bottles it is now at my bottom:) I love this product!!! I recommend this to anyone! :)</li>
    <li> Since my 1st with my twins my hair had fallen out and with my third child the prenatal care still wouldn&#x27;t do anything for me I have spent hundreds of dollars every month trying to get my hair back until I went on Amazon and saw Groveda. I must say for an amazing price this product helped my hair grow super fast in just 4 days it is now shoulder length and super soft and manageable I now have my self esteem and confidence back ill never go back to another hair store to buy hair oil again. I was not paid to do this review, this is a real review. I recommend this oil for fast hair growth.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about two months. It has a pleasant scent and is easy to use. My hair loss is due to side effects from a medication. Instead of using another product which might increase hair loss, I decided to try this product. Although the results have not been as fast as the ad would have you believe, I can see improvement in my hair and evidence of some growth already.</li>
    <li> I used this the first time I washed my hair. I thought about it when I washed my hair last night.I used the Sensa Oil instead. The Sensa Oil realledy helped my hair. But the Goveda Fast Hair Growth Products really helped my hair also. I will order this product again.</li>
    <li> Well  really  its to soon to rate because I just started using this oil but love the smell</li>
    <li> I really wanted to try this oil,  so no review</li>
    <li> Ok product just put peppermint essential oil to help your hair</li>
    <li> I can not express to you how fast the FASTGRO Hair Growth oil has worked for me. My hair has grown two inches in two months. What ever you guys are doing, please keep it up. My goal is to have hip length hair, and I am sure I will reach that milestone within 6 months.</li>
    <li> Semi working but in a very slow and minimal process. Can probably find something that will actually &amp;#34;rapidly&amp;#34; work and live up to it&#x27;s name.</li>
    <li> I just Starr using it. I can&#x27;t tell right  now  because  it&#x27;s too soon. I hope it works for  me</li>
    <li> Hi ladies, Can you tell me how you are all using this product. I used it for the first time last night and boy dis my hair look greasy. I never used anything like this before so I want to see how everyone else uses it. I washed my hair but I did not condition it. After the shower I applied the serum and massaged it into my scalp and slept with it in</li>
    <li> I love it for hair growth faster perfect</li>
    <li> I saw growth in 2 weeks. Great product!</li>
    <li> does not contain enough Amla</li>
    <li> Groveda is crap product i demand refund</li>
    <li> Great hair growth oil, will be ordering more</li>
    <li> I am currently a fan of Amla oil already so this product is right up my ally starting to see some growth as well. I would recommend this to anyone looking to grow there hair naturally.</li>
