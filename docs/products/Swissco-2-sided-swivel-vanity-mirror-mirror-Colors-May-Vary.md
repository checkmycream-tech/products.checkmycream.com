<li> Does the job, but the mirror is smaller then I expected.</li>
<li> it is like an upside down petri dish made to look like it is thick but really isn&#x27;t.</li>
<li> A bit flimsy bbutthats to be expected for the price.</li>
<li> I received the mirror in pale blue.</li>
<li> A little small for an adult.</li>
<li> It arrived in one piece instead of a million little pieces.</li>
<li> round mirror part was not put together though</li>
<li> a little small but usable.</li>
<li> A little small, but I was expecting that.  </li>
<li> I had to pick up the mirror, hold the base in one hand and try to rotate it side to side with the other hand...</li>
<li> It&#x27;s small and all collapse into pieces when delivered!!!</li>
<li> BUT the swivel (round post on the base that should rotate) doesn&#x27;t work so well.  </li>
<li> it looks like the base is 1 cm thick....</li>
<li> For the price paid (4.00) it isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
<li> It isn&#x27;t bad, but not my color choice.</li>

    <li> My fault for not reading description but this thing is tiny. Its good for my 4 year old niece.</li>
    <li> Miror works, so I should be happy.  A little small, but I was expecting that.  Very basic plastic.  Great for my 5 year-old, not much else to say</li>
    <li> Great value for the price!</li>
    <li> A great deal, not up to heavy use but excellent for travelling with a hard makeup case. The bottom comes off for easy storage.</li>
    <li> Affordable and perfectly discreet for my desk at work.</li>
    <li> Like it for the price but need a bit more then 3x magnification so giving this one to my daughter and order a different one for myself.</li>
    <li> Cute. a little small but usable.</li>
    <li> smaller than I thought it would be. Also very, very light weight.</li>
    <li> Just the right size, not too big and not too small. Convenient for travel and at home. Love the magnifying side for applying my eyeliner</li>
    <li> I got it in blue &amp; it&#x27;s a pretty good mirror.</li>
    <li> Small, but perfect for kids.  Good price.  We used them for face painting and they worked out well.  . .</li>
    <li> Cheat made. Keeps falling off stand and the mirror is more like a plastic type mirror. Did not like one bit.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s small and all collapse into pieces when delivered!!!</li>
    <li> this mirror is a good little mirror, got it for my granddaughter it serves the purpose.So is your looking for a cheap little mirror this is ok.</li>
    <li> This mirror is 3X magnification but the description states it is 5X.  Do not order this if you want 5X.</li>
    <li> A bit flimsy bbutthats to be expected for the price. Birthday gift for 12 yo girl and she liked it. A little small for an adult.</li>
    <li> Mirror isn&#x27;t very sturdy and falls out of the stand.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my 7 year old granddaughter, Well made and love the color. Bought this as a gift!  Someone&#x27;s going to be happy for Christmas. I love how it swivels.</li>
    <li> I received the mirror in pale blue. It isn&#x27;t bad, but not my color choice. This is nicer than what you would get in a dollar store. The mirrors are distortion free. For the price paid (4.00) it isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
    <li> I received this mirror and well, I see now, why it was so cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mirror itself came in a plastic packaging that was simple enough to easily remove.&lt;br /&gt;The round mirror part was not put together though, I had to do that myself after I pulled it out.&lt;br /&gt;The mirror easily tilts up and down as you want BUT the swivel (round post on the base that should rotate) doesn&#x27;t work so well.  I had to pick up the mirror, hold the base in one hand and try to rotate it side to side with the other hand... I would definitely not recommend using that in fear of breaking it on the first try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need a mirror and don&#x27;t care for anything else... well this will work for you.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a mirror of substantial quality... then this is definitely NOT for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plastic parts were so poorly made that it doesn&#x27;t even look smooth and had peelings kind of like threads on a cloth except the threads are plastic.&lt;br /&gt;If you look at the picture it looks like the base is 1 cm thick.... it isn&#x27;t  it is like an upside down petri dish made to look like it is thick but really isn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and seems fine for the price.  Will be a Christmas present, so I didn&#x27;t open it completely.</li>
    <li> Mine came with a crack on the bottom of the mirror. It would cost more to send it back then I paid so I guess I&#x27;ll use it until it cracks more. This is the 2nd time I bought this. Both came cracked</li>
    <li> Fast shipping A+ thank you</li>
    <li> This is a nice little mirror. I bought it for my daughter to put makeup on in her room. She loves it! I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> nice but kind of flincy</li>
    <li> Arrived busted . Returned for refund. The end. 😃</li>
    <li> This mirror has worked out well for me. It arrived in one piece instead of a million little pieces. I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Does the job, but the mirror is smaller then I expected.</li>
    <li> I got this lil mirror to take with me on vacation this spring. It was great! Perfect lil size, swivel sides and sturdy holder, and most of the all - the price was right on. I was sent a purple one, and I love it. It&#x27;s perfect for a close-up vanity mirror, or in a child&#x27;s room as it would be a great size for them too. Very lightweight and packable for travel.</li>
    <li> I got a blue one.  I love the little thing. I have at my work desk, I use it go may sure I look okay,  and as a rear view mirror lol</li>
