      <li>Bottom line this one is okay, but the same one that is waterproof is excellent for me, but you can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore.</li>
      <li>Love this mascara</li>
      <li>ok</li>
      <li>I love the curved brush and the primer layer gives my lashes the fullness i was hoping for.</li>
      <li>This used to be my favorite</li>
      <li>and i love the product.</li>
      <li>I have bought more than one and would of continued to get this kind of mascara if it came fresh!</li>
      <li>What a shocker when I realized it was still very fresh in the package!  </li>
      <li>It made my eyelashes look so pretty :)) I always have a problem finding mascara that makes me eyes look good.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and is better than most mascaras I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gotten lots of complements on how long and beautiful my lashes are!</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for amazing lashes!</li>
      <li>I also love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t smudge and washes off cleanly.  </li>
      <li>Easy.</li>
      <li>also like that this mascara doesn&#x27;t clump up-and it easily comes off in the shower or when you wash your face.</li>
      <li>At first I thought it was no longer made, so was thrilled when I saw it online.  </li>
      <li>Love that it shows up so quickly, and I don&#x27;t have to go out to get it</li>
      <li>Great low price to try this mascara.</li>
      <li>Cheap.</li>
      <li>love having it delivered right to my front door</li>
      <li>I love it very much.  </li>
      <li>However, when i fiund it on Amazon i was thrilled at the amazing low price and fast shipping.</li>
      <li>I really did love this mascara.</li>
      <li>It was only good for about two to three uses.</li>
      <li>Extends and gives you full lashes.</li>
      <li>Its hard to find a good product and nice brush....</li>
      <li>arrived quickly and correct product.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite mascara ever, but I ordered the one with the curling brush which is more a nuisance for me personally.</li>
      <li>i love the mascara highly recommended.</li>
      <li>For 5 days I did my right eye with Great Lash and the other with XXL, the lashes on my right eye always looked longer and thicker.  </li>
      <li>This gave a more natural and lengthy feature to my lashes, in my opinion.</li>
      <li>I was tired of looking for a good mascara with nice curved brush.</li>
      <li>the price is right</li>
      <li>Many many women have told me that they love my eyelashes and assume that I have fake lashes on because it makes my lashes look amazing.&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
      <li>love it its the only mascara I wear</li>
      <li>This arrived really fast!</li>
      <li>It really does give me longer eyelashes that are noticeable!  </li>
      <li>I will definitely be getting more of these when I run out.</li>
      <li>Pro: The black mascara applicator (Step 2) goes on nicely without smearing.</li>
      <li>Goes on good and makes lashes extra long.</li>
      <li>I used it to reveal the lashs I have that don&#x27;t really show at the end</li>
      <li>Fast shipping and execellent product.</li>
      <li>Very clumpy.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Like the microfiber but doesn&#x27;t really help the curl.</li>
      <li>it was not too intense.</li>
      <li>I am very surprised to read all of these positive reviews of this</li>
      <li>For those of us with older eyelashes</li>
      <li>My only gripe is that I wish it came with more as the tube is regular sized but divided into 3 sections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My eyelashes are long, but very straight, and this mascara really does seem to curl them well.  </li>
      <li>I have to use a new tube every day because the mascara is expired and if I dont it goes on clumpy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if my lashes are more curled since I&#x27;m in the habit of curling them before mascara</li>
      <li>so far!</li>
      <li>Comes off easily with a little soap or make up remover</li>
      <li>It is old.  </li>
      <li>I first saw this mascara on a youtube video about how to get long eyelashes...</li>
      <li>When used properly it makes your eyelashes look so full and long.  </li>
      <li>Because there is a wand on the top and one on the bottom, there is less mascara than if it had just been one large tube of black mascara.</li>
      <li>No need to wait for the first layer to dry.</li>
      <li>sure you do from Root to tip with step 1 and then wait for it to dry for about 30 secs then put the black mascara on-</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried expensive ones and no one can give me lashes that look as long as great lash does.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite mascara and is hard to find in local stores.  </li>
      <li>I have the short, straight Asian lashes</li>
      <li>the curved brush does an okay job, but it makes it sort of tough to get the corners and bottom lashes.</li>
      <li>I really like the primer/mascara duo, but on mine the primer is so dry none of it actually goes onto my lashes.</li>
      <li>This item needs to &amp;#34;call out&amp;#34; it&#x27;s functions more clearly on the packaging, as I was not aware of the 2 Step application before purchasing and thus was surprised when I found it to be a &amp;#34;two-part&amp;#34; (half curling applicator / half mascara).</li>
      <li>You are supposed to apply #1 first (which is white in color), then #2 (the black).</li>
      <li>I have tried a dozen of other mascaras and this one is the only one who really makes my lashes curl.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am obsessed with makeup and I have to say this is my Fav Mascara ever.  When used properly it makes your eyelashes look so full and long.  Many many women have told me that they love my eyelashes and assume that I have fake lashes on because it makes my lashes look amazing.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you do from Root to tip with step 1 and then wait for it to dry for about 30 secs then put the black mascara on-some women might be skeptical because step 1 is white but as long as you have a magnified mirror you can do step 2 and make sure its all covered up.&lt;br /&gt;I also like that this mascara doesn&#x27;t clump up-and it easily comes off in the shower or when you wash your face.</li>
    <li> I have to use a new tube every day because the mascara is expired and if I dont it goes on clumpy.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mascara and is hard to find in local stores.  At first I thought it was no longer made, so was thrilled when I saw it online.  My eyelashes are long, but very straight, and this mascara really does seem to curl them well.  I like the color and texture as well, and it is long lasting but not waterproof.</li>
    <li> Old, dry, clumpy and didn&#x27;t work nearly like previous mascara I had bought like this.  This used to be my favorite but you can&#x27;t buy it any longer.</li>
    <li> Clumpy, dried out not worth the money.  Guess it was a sale item so the quality is the same as the price</li>
    <li> This product is simply amazing. I have tried a dozen of other mascaras and this one is the only one who really makes my lashes curl. I even have been asked if I had lashes extensions while I was wearing it! (I wasn&#x27;t wearing any extensions, only this mascara.) Unfortunately, we can&#x27;t buy it in drugstores anymore. I was extremely happy to see that it was still available online. I ordered 2 and I received them on time with no extra fees. I recommend it 100%!!</li>
    <li> This is the BEST mascara - I really wish it were still available! For those of us with older eyelashes it eliminates the need for eyelash extensions or prescription enhancements.</li>
    <li> love it its the only mascara I wear I cant get longer lashes then with this . I wanted extensions but there no difference from when I wear this so id recommend it any day</li>
    <li> muy bueno todo ,envio rapido  buen precio buena cualidad recibido mas o menos en el tiempo previsto&lt;br /&gt;los recomendo good purchase ....ok</li>
    <li> I wanted a curling mascara and this was no different than any other mascara. Would not recommend if thats what you want</li>
    <li> This product makes my eyelashes very long.. not sure if the two step process is really necessary though. Comes off easily with a little soap or make up remover</li>
    <li> I first saw this mascara on a youtube video about how to get long eyelashes...I have the short, straight Asian lashes so I&#x27;m always on the lookout for things that will give me longer, curly lashes.  After watching the video, I thought I&#x27;d give this mascara a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I did!  It really does give me longer eyelashes that are noticeable!  It is two parts but it&#x27;s not that much harder to put on...kind of like putting on two coats of mascara.  I love it!  It gives me lots of length and it actually curls for me.  I also love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t smudge and washes off cleanly.  My only gripe is that I wish it came with more as the tube is regular sized but divided into 3 sections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy to have found this mascara.  It does more for me than the expensive ones I&#x27;ve purchased.  I will definitely be getting more of these when I run out.</li>
    <li> White first coat and then black second coat. Ugh. I like the formula that is a black/black formula. ugh. ugh.</li>
    <li> I wish this were still sold in the stores, I love it. It&#x27;s easy to apply and is better than most mascaras I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> the price is right and i love the product. will purchase again. love having it delivered right to my front door</li>
    <li> I love this mascara and was sad that i could not find it in stores. However, when i fiund it on Amazon i was thrilled at the amazing low price and fast shipping. I love the curved brush and the primer layer gives my lashes the fullness i was hoping for. Its hard to find a good product and nice brush....but this has both. No need to wait for the first layer to dry. I apply primer to both then immediately apply the second color layer. It doesnt take extra time like others mentioned. I was tired of looking for a good mascara with nice curved brush. Found this and bought 3!</li>
    <li> I really did love this mascara. It made my eyelashes look so pretty :)) I always have a problem finding mascara that makes me eyes look good. This one I&#x27;ll probably stick with</li>
    <li> The product the itself is great.. The price was good and received alot quicker than I thought I would. My only ugh is the length of the wands.. If they were longer i feel there there would be better \\&quot;control\\&quot; while applying.</li>
    <li> Like the microfiber but doesn&#x27;t really help the curl.</li>
    <li> This gave a more natural and lengthy feature to my lashes, in my opinion. it was not too intense. The primer was great! I used it to reveal the lashs I have that don&#x27;t really show at the end, becasue they are so end. Basically, I use this alone for an eeveryday, flowy look and as a base under &amp;#34;Maybelline Volumin Exopress&amp;#34; to add leangth before all the voulme that the other product provides.</li>
    <li> i have not used this yet, but i can not wait to try it out. It was a great price.</li>
    <li> love step one mascra is ok</li>
    <li> Hands downs the best mascara I have ever used!  No clumping.  Just long think eyelashes.  This product is hard to find but worth the search.</li>
    <li> i purchased one of these for myself and my mother in law. arrived quickly and correct product. i love the mascara highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This arrived really fast! Same packaging as what I buy in store&lt;br /&gt;For half the price. Will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> Dry, clumpy, Just aweful. Definitely Not for me. No recommendation whatsoever. I would recommend going to your Rite Aid ladies.</li>
    <li> Very clumpy.  It is old.  need to check expiration dates before sending it out to customers.  Won&#x27;t buy again ever.</li>
    <li> Buen producto, de muy buena calidad, lo recomiendo... Very good and very nice product, I recommend it to all of you</li>
    <li> Cheap. Works great. Not sketch. Met expectations. Use it every day. Fast shipping. Easy. Awesome. Love it. Yay. Rock on.</li>
    <li> I am again disappointed by the dryness when opening the mascara to use. It was only good for about two to three uses. I have bought more than one and would of continued to get this kind of mascara if it came fresh! Please fix !!</li>
    <li> I love it. Fast shipping and execellent product. Goes on good and makes lashes extra long. I love it very much.  Thank yoy</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that there are two different compartments in this mascara. You are supposed to apply #1 first (which is white in color), then #2 (the black). Because there is a wand on the top and one on the bottom, there is less mascara than if it had just been one large tube of black mascara. It&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m used to and won&#x27;t be getting it again.</li>
    <li> I really like the primer/mascara duo, but on mine the primer is so dry none of it actually goes onto my lashes. On the plus side when I do wear it it works well and doesn&#x27;t flake or smear.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mascara ever, but I ordered the one with the curling brush which is more a nuisance for me personally. Next time, I will order regular.</li>
    <li> what the heck.  one side is a gloppy white goo you put on, then open up the other side and glop on some black goo.  ??? very small bottle considering it has 2 small containers on both sides.. will not buy again.. gross</li>
    <li> Really expected this to be old and dry.  What a shocker when I realized it was still very fresh in the package!  Two thumbs up for this seller!</li>
    <li> Pros it gives me long eyelashes only Con is that it clumps if your in a hurry. which I always am other than that it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Great low price to try this mascara. I&#x27;m not sure if my lashes are more curled since I&#x27;m in the habit of curling them before mascara but it goes on nice with no clumps.</li>
    <li> Horrible!  Gets all over. I don&#x27;t understand what the white brush does.  The price was great however. I would not purchase it again</li>
    <li> I have used curved brush mascaras before but this one seems curved to the extreme.  I actually have to turn the wand sideways to apply.  I used the primer once, it is way to thick and globby.  Usually happy with Maybelline but not this time</li>
    <li> the curved brush does an okay job, but it makes it sort of tough to get the corners and bottom lashes.</li>
    <li> Love it and great price, doesn&#x27;t get better than that. Love that it shows up so quickly, and I don&#x27;t have to go out to get it</li>
    <li> This was actually for my mother and overall she loves it!! This is a great product would definently recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a LOT of Maybelline mascara and this is my Favorite...so far! I&#x27;ve gotten lots of complements on how long and beautiful my lashes are! I even had someone ask me if i was wearing fake eye lashes! I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for amazing lashes!</li>
    <li> Love this mascara and I can never find it in any store!!!! It&#x27;s awesome I can get it on here</li>
    <li> I am very surprised to read all of these positive reviews of this product.&lt;br /&gt;I think it is very very poor and lacking quality.&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t buy agin.</li>
    <li> I have tried many types of mascara over the years and I&#x27;ve yet to find one as good as Maybelline Great Lash. I&#x27;ve tried expensive ones and no one can give me lashes that look as long as great lash does.  The XXL mascara is pretty weird, I only found out by reading these reviews that first you use the white brush, then the black brush. The white brush seemed to get a lot of white gunk on my lash.  For 5 days I did my right eye with Great Lash and the other with XXL, the lashes on my right eye always looked longer and thicker.  I give it 3 stars because it does work and it hasn&#x27;t clumped on me, but it&#x27;s not a 5 star.</li>
    <li> I purchased the wrong product, but didn&#x27;t want to pay the high cost return I wanted the waterproof and ended up with the right brand but the wrong product not sure if I ordered it wrong or it was sent wrong. Bottom line this one is okay, but the same one that is waterproof is excellent for me, but you can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore.</li>
    <li> I grabbed this mascara because it was on deep discount and with Prime, I couldn&#x27;t pass it up.  I&#x27;m not a frequent make-up wearer by any stretch of the imagination, but it gets the job done and here we are several months later and I have yet to see it start to clump.  A+ in my book!</li>
    <li> I love this product. No longer necessary to use an eye lash curler when you use this. Extends and gives you full lashes.</li>
    <li> Pro: The black mascara applicator (Step 2) goes on nicely without smearing. Con: The white &amp;#34;curling&amp;#34; (Step 1) applicator goes on too thick. This item needs to &amp;#34;call out&amp;#34; it&#x27;s functions more clearly on the packaging, as I was not aware of the 2 Step application before purchasing and thus was surprised when I found it to be a &amp;#34;two-part&amp;#34; (half curling applicator / half mascara).</li>
