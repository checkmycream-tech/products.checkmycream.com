      <li>It&#x27;s just OK hairspray.</li>
      <li>My best in the galaxy hair can tolerate using only this hairspray if need be.</li>
      <li>If I was going for a more relaxed look it would be okay, but I have a mohawk.</li>
      <li>I only give it 4 starts because I am still looking for the perfect hairspray!</li>
      <li>and I am so glad I did.</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried has made my hair look like I haven&#x27;t showered in days, and most hairsprays have that effect too.  </li>
      <li>Whoever dreamed that one up, Jeff Bezos, make sure that person gets a sprawling estate</li>
      <li>ok i reckon, through i&#x27;m using at the moment a mix of vidal sasson and salon selectives too</li>
      <li>Favorite hair spray.  </li>
      <li>I will getting more of this product.</li>
      <li>I have used many hairsprays before, but I have never had one that made my throat swell up</li>
      <li>This is a nice light hairspray that doesn&#x27;t flatten the hair.</li>
      <li>This is more of an every day-after-blow out hair spray.  </li>
      <li>However, when ordering subscriptions, I am always try to make sure I have 5, so I get the 15% discount.  </li>
      <li>This works very well and has a pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>This spray is perfect for after you dry your hair and apply a pomade product &amp; style.</li>
      <li>I usually do not use hair spray, but this works great.</li>
      <li>I have wispy, fine hair that attracts moisture in order to &amp;#34;fluff&amp;#34; itself to a more acceptable fullness.  </li>
      <li>it does really well but have to use quite a bit for a good hold also pricing</li>
      <li>I have fine hair that gets greasy easy and researched a lot before buying this product.  </li>
      <li>A huge afro on my head.</li>
      <li>After drying I can smooth out</li>
      <li>and my hair looked great event the following day.</li>
      <li>I can straighten my hair in the morning, brush it out, lightly spray it with this and voila; it looks like that all day.  </li>
      <li>Hair still moves freely but holds well.</li>
      <li>I like cheap.</li>
      <li>I needed a cheap hairspray so I bought it.</li>
      <li>However, I did start using this after the summer was over so it hasn&#x27;t stood up to the ultimate test yet, but I&#x27;m happy.</li>
      <li>It has been cheap.</li>
      <li>Oh well...it&#x27;s good to have a back up :).</li>
      <li>It also did seem to do a good job as far as the anti-humidity claim goes.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m pretty sure it shouldn&#x27;t be doing this.  </li>
      <li>, i believe it&#x27;s really good, holds the hair strong for a long time</li>
      <li>/&gt;The smell is pretty nice, a nice change from the usual Tresemme, but Tresemme has a nice scent as well.  </li>
      <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a good hairspray.</li>
      <li>output of the spray is very focused as well, which would probably be great if you tease your hair and style, but I had to hold it back pretty far to get a good spread.  </li>
      <li>It has a nice, fresh, non-hairspray smell and it actually helps my hair keep its shape.  </li>
      <li>For the price it is totally worth keeping in your vanity.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave any build up on my hair and is just right for me.  </li>
      <li>Good hold and not super sticky.</li>
      <li>I recently got a hair cut so its even more acceptable.</li>
      <li>At first I thought, maybe I made the mistake of not shaking up the can</li>
      <li>I love the hairspray, I work outside</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s like spraying air on my hair - it does absolutely nothing!  </li>
      <li>The hairspray is light and keeps my hair soft but under control.</li>
      <li>really works!  </li>
      <li>The smell is also great which is convenient since hair spray usually fogs up the entire bathroom with its strong odor.</li>
      <li>Naturally, the words &amp;#34;anti-humidity&amp;#34; caught my gaze right away!  </li>
      <li>The spray goes over the final style and gives it the hold it needs without being too strong.</li>
      <li>I flood them about daily and am able to do a day&#x27;s printing typically without refreshing and my ABS prints stay put very well.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t beat the price and the quality is exactly what I needed, I highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
      <li>Found this ranked up there pretty high so decided to give it</li>
      <li>add a little more and im golden for the day.</li>
      <li>the meantime, I am loving this hairspray - it works, even down here in air you can almost touch!</li>
      <li>And its okay cheap at least.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>&quot; I found it dries out my hair too much.</li>
      <li>Appreciated as a gift with Garnier Fructis Style XXL Body Thickening</li>
      <li>But it really doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very pleased with this hairspray, and you don&#x27;t need a ton</li>
    <li> I have wispy, fine hair that attracts moisture in order to &amp;#34;fluff&amp;#34; itself to a more acceptable fullness.  The hairspray is light and keeps my hair soft but under control.</li>
    <li> I actually am allergic to this product. I have used many hairsprays before, but I have never had one that made my throat swell up and my mouth go dry. If you have seasonal allergies or asthma, i would suggest testing it out with the travel size before you waste your money on the full size.</li>
    <li> Did exactly what I thought it would, lasts my hair the entire day. You might need to spray near the bangs a bit more though if you find that it doesn&#x27;t hold the entire day. The smell is great and not even that noticeable.</li>
    <li> I like the hold and the light unobtrusive fragrance, but I won&#x27;t again pay here 4 times the price at which I can buy it locally.</li>
    <li> Naturally, the words &amp;#34;anti-humidity&amp;#34; caught my gaze right away!  Here on the Alabama Gulf Coast, we wrote the book on HUMIDITY.  My first day of school memories for each year are cloudy, due to the massive amounts of Aqua Net emanating from every female head over 12 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My former fave was Bedhead, but although it held my hair, it&#x27;s expensive and it left my hair looking a bit dull.  I gave the Garnier a try because of the brand and the price (about 1/3 of what Bedhead costs) and of course, the &amp;#34;anti-humidity&amp;#34; claim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really works!  It has a nice, fresh, non-hairspray smell and it actually helps my hair keep its shape.  Also, my hair still looks alive with this stuff on it; it still has some shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without my Amazon subscriptions, I never would have found this - or even looked for it.  However, when ordering subscriptions, I am always try to make sure I have 5, so I get the 15% discount.  Whoever dreamed that one up, Jeff Bezos, make sure that person gets a sprawling estate somewhere - great idea!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime, I am loving this hairspray - it works, even down here in air you can almost touch!</li>
    <li> use it for make dry flowers&lt;br /&gt;and it turn out not working</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product in the \\&quot;Sleek &amp; Shine Anti-Humidity Hairspray, Ultra Strong\\&quot; version for years and loved it.  Decided to try the UV Color Shield and it&#x27;s like spraying air on my hair - it does absolutely nothing!  No hold, no humidity control - nothing, except makes my clean hair feel dirty! And I&#x27;m having difficulty contacting the company by phone and email. Back to the store it goes.</li>
    <li> I bought this mainly for the UV Color shield. I want to protect my Ombre hair color from the fading rays of the sun. I couldn&#x27;t find it around my local stores until yesterday, I found it at Walmart after I order it here. Oh well...it&#x27;s good to have a back up :).</li>
    <li> Good hold and not super sticky. Overall, it&#x27;s a good hairspray. It also did seem to do a good job as far as the anti-humidity claim goes. I live in Florida and went out on a very muggy, rainy day and my hair looked great event the following day.</li>
    <li> Hair still moves freely but holds well. Not a super workhorse for extreme hair dos but works great for keeping the frizz out of my hair after I style it. Smells nice but doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell once it&#x27;s on. A fair amount of product and spray nicely.</li>
    <li> Flexible hold without salon prices.  I have long, naturally straight hair and this holds my curls all day long.  Always difficult to do since I live in the South and the humidity is brutal to longer hair styles.  This is my favorite hairspray!</li>
    <li> The hairspray held well, but the can could not dispense all the hairspray. It quit working while there was still product in the bottle.</li>
    <li> I live in an area that has high humidity and this worked well. So well in fact that I don&#x27;t want to use the other sprays they offer haha.</li>
    <li> This is a nice light hairspray that doesn&#x27;t flatten the hair.</li>
    <li> decent but you can&#x27;t really find the lower hold strenghs in stores, i&#x27;ve mostly flip floped between brands as of late but  garnier;s ok i reckon, through i&#x27;m using at the moment a mix of vidal sasson and salon selectives too</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get it twisted - this hair spray is not meant for some crazy up do.  This is more of an every day-after-blow out hair spray.  For the price it is totally worth keeping in your vanity.  Also, the smell is great and not too chemical-y.</li>
    <li> Had to go pick another brand of hairspray since they bulked up my usual Tresemme order to a six pack instead of one.  Found this ranked up there pretty high so decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The button trigger immediately fell off after I pulled off the cap, no biggie, I just snapped it back on and it works fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is pretty nice, a nice change from the usual Tresemme, but Tresemme has a nice scent as well.  After applying a little more than usual, since I wasn&#x27;t used to the spray output, it started smelling like AquaNet.  No thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The output of the spray is very focused as well, which would probably be great if you tease your hair and style, but I had to hold it back pretty far to get a good spread.  Doesn&#x27;t matter though, I guess I&#x27;ll save it for teasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after trying it out for the first time, and having applied a little too much, the hairspray dried up with spots of dried hairspray on my hair that I found out I have at the end of the day.  White spots on black hair is definitely not good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s gonna take some time to get used to, but definitely going back to Tresemme after this.</li>
    <li> Nice hair spray for a good price.  Works well.</li>
    <li> Liked my hair spray great hold on&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A windy day</li>
    <li> This says ULTRA STRONG, but I have thick hair and it just doesn&#x27;t keep it standing up. I was disappointed because the price is good, it smells nice, and it isn&#x27;t gunky or sticky. If I was going for a more relaxed look it would be okay, but I have a mohawk. This just doesn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
    <li> I tried hairsprays several times before, but I always hated them - they made my hair stick together and feel like wire, but this one, surprisingly, doesn&#x27;t! It holds hair perfectly, and at the end of the day I can comb my hair pretty easily, and  after that it feels like clean hair! Amazing. And, what is most important, it smells so good! All hair sprays smell terrible to me, but this one smells very good! I am just so happy with it. Would only buy this one next time.</li>
    <li> Hairspray is very good on hold, pricing, packaging.  I use this every morning to hold my curls and they naturally fall in the afternoon but I think it gives it a nice feel all day.  I only give it 4 starts because I am still looking for the perfect hairspray!</li>
    <li> have bleached hair and this completely protects in the sun............hard to find such a product even at beauty supply houses.  this is a GREAT product.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing. Great hold on my hair. And it still looks natural after applying. I recommend to anyone who likes hair to stay in place while still looking natural</li>
    <li> Smells so good and has great hold! I hate the really chemical smelling hair sprays because I always try to smell nice. This spray smells beautiful and works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> if your plan is to look like a 80s rocker chick... stick with aquanet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you just want somethign that will kinda hold your hair somewhat in place this will do it. i get out of shower comb my hair and spray this in and it stays for the majority of the day and if i fall asleep with out showering it doesnt mess up my pillow and its enough that i can just wet my hair in the morning add a little more and im golden for the day.</li>
    <li> This stuff is crap.  I have short hair and it&#x27;s like spraying a water mist over your hair.  It doesn&#x27;t do anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if I got a bad batch or what.</li>
    <li> I needed a cheap hairspray so I bought it. I normally like Garnier products but this just sucked. It won&#x27;t hold at all. My hair ends up just flopping. It&#x27;s awful.</li>
    <li> I believe i have purchased this specific hair spray a couple of times based on price alone. It has been cheap. I like cheap. And its okay cheap at least. I can rely on this hair spray. My best in the galaxy hair can tolerate using only this hairspray if need be. I recently got a hair cut so its even more acceptable. I feel like i was flying through a bottle of this stuff much too quickly when my hair was longer and bigger. Oh and even my mother thought this hair spray was good at taming this frizz one encounters when at the beach. Me ? i actually like that puffy frizz that the salt in the air does to ones hair while at the shore.</li>
    <li> My hair literally stuck together with this spray... I don&#x27;t know what they did to it but I threw it out. Could not use it at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 22 year old male with relatively medium-length curly hair and I highly recommend this product. This spray is perfect for after you dry your hair and apply a pomade product &amp; style. The spray goes over the final style and gives it the hold it needs without being too strong. The smell is also great which is convenient since hair spray usually fogs up the entire bathroom with its strong odor. I&#x27;ve bought a few bottles of this stuff and each one usually lasts me about 2 months. Can&#x27;t beat the price and the quality is exactly what I needed, I highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Smells great, with awesome hold.  Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Smells nice. Great hold.</li>
    <li> Great strong hold and smells good too!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold that well!</li>
    <li> I already use Garnier Fructis products. I usually do not use hair spray, but this works great. It is not stiff, but holds. I will getting more of this product.</li>
    <li> Smells great.good hold.  Does not make hair too stiff. The lid was shattered when it arrived, but I just used another that I had from a previous one.</li>
    <li> I love the hairspray, I work outside it does really well but have to use quite a bit for a good hold also pricing is key some sellers have this marked too high</li>
    <li> This was a great buy. Other cans this size in the store are 2 or 3 times as much. I like Garnier products.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just OK hairspray.</li>
    <li> I bought this to help hold up braided up-dos. I have long, thick hair and I need all the help I can get to keep the style together during these humid months. This works very well and has a pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other hair sprays that are either too stiff or leave flakes. Garnier is perfect. Great hold, smells great, leaves my hair soft and touchable. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Appreciated as a gift with Garnier Fructis Style XXL Body Thickening</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I like the Fructis hair-color products and it claimed to have the color protection which I need.  It must be the ingredients that are added to claim it is for \\&quot;humidity control .\\&quot; I found it dries out my hair too much. Would not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair that gets greasy easy and researched a lot before buying this product.  I love it.  It doesn&#x27;t leave any build up on my hair and is just right for me.  Happy with my purchase.  I threw out all my other hairsprays.</li>
    <li> Excellent styling product,have used it before, and will keep using it. Has a great smell. And holds the style you create.</li>
    <li> It is designed to keep things in place and that is what it does.  Works well and fulfilled all that was expected of it.</li>
    <li> I have natural hair. A huge afro on my head. I straightened my hair and used this to prevent it from frizzing back up. But it really doesn&#x27;t work.  Oh well on to the next hair product.</li>
    <li> I really like using this hair spray, it will last the whole day and night. It also has a UV shield which is a plus for summer.</li>
    <li> I have fine, wavy hair which is hard to manage and gets frizzy in the summer (I live in DC.  It&#x27;s literally a swamp).  Any type of cream or oil I&#x27;ve tried has made my hair look like I haven&#x27;t showered in days, and most hairsprays have that effect too.  This stuff is different.  I can straighten my hair in the morning, brush it out, lightly spray it with this and voila; it looks like that all day.  However, I did start using this after the summer was over so it hasn&#x27;t stood up to the ultimate test yet, but I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> Really like the strength of hold.&lt;br /&gt;Has firm hold but doesn&#x27;t look or feel sticky.&lt;br /&gt;Has nice even spray mist application.</li>
    <li> This holds and protects your hair. Go too hair spray for the summer months and beyond here in Southern Cali!</li>
    <li> I switched from salon brands to this about a year ago to save money and I am so glad I did. It works just as well and smells great!</li>
    <li> The hair is not at all chunky when sprayed and holds alright. The price is the killer and I have used a lot of expensive stuff and they did not come as good as this.</li>
    <li> For the Solidoodle 3D Printer Fans out there, this is my go-to product for spraying my heated mirror platforms on my Solidoodle2 3D Printer. I flood them about daily and am able to do a day&#x27;s printing typically without refreshing and my ABS prints stay put very well. A great value at the price.</li>
    <li> I like this hairspray it is good for every day use and is workable so you can restyle during the day without having to respray.</li>
    <li> Favorite hair spray.  keeps my &#x27;do&#x27; in place all day.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use hairspray often, but this works well. It held my hair, but didn&#x27;t really make a difference on the humid days. My hair just got sticky like when I use any other hairspray. But I like the smell and the type of hold and will buy again.</li>
    <li> I live in Atlanta, GA where humidity can be quite difficult on a hairdo. I was hoping this anti-humidity hairspray would help combat the issue but in fact, it made it worse. I have naturally curly, long hair. Not oily at all, maybe frizzy at times but just normal hair. The first time I used this product, I couldn&#x27;t believe how heavy the spray was. it made my hair look wet! At first I thought, maybe I made the mistake of not shaking up the can so the next time I tried it I shook it up before spraying. Again, it made my hair look wet. Not only that, it had a funky smell. I&#x27;m a fan of Garnier products as I color my hair with them and buy the shampoo/conditioner so I was very surprised at how awful this product was. I hoped this would be as great as the rest of the products I use but it&#x27;s not even close. Don&#x27;t do it, don&#x27;t bother with buying this wet, stinky hairspray.</li>
    <li> despite i have few days wit it, i believe it&#x27;s really good, holds the hair strong for a long time</li>
    <li> I love the scent but it leaves white residue behind. Not sure if I&#x27;m using it wrong or if it&#x27;s a bad can, but I&#x27;m pretty sure it shouldn&#x27;t be doing this.  Although I have to add that it doesn&#x27;t do it every time ........just like 1 out of 3 days or so.</li>
    <li> I have frizzy-curly hair and while my hair is wet I apply Paul Mitchell Sculpting Foam and then spray the Garnier all over.  After drying I can smooth out and there is no flaking or wet look.  Love it!</li>
