    <li> I bought this at a local pharmacy about three months ago. After using it for several weeks I noticed a funny odor and black stuff around the edges. It had molded. Evidently the manufacturer is receiving complaints. Buyers be aware.</li>
    <li> I decided to give this a try after seeing them EVERYWHERE - they are unique and the smell and taste great.  They do keep my lips soft, but I found that I have to reapply quite a bit. I ended up giving these to my 9 year old - she LOVES it!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. It moisturizes nicely without making you feel the need to put more and more on. It has a very light scent/taste, nothing overpowering. One jar lasts a long time, so it&#x27;s definitely worth the cost. My go-to lip product.</li>
    <li> I love this eos I love the shape its soo different and the secent smells soo good, when I put it in my lips I was lick them off lol but this is a goos flavor and it moisturizes</li>
    <li> BUT I love this! I love the feel of it and how ling it lasts on my lips. I love the smell (the taste is irrelevant as I don&#x27;t seem to taste it). And i love, Love, LOve, LOV, LOVE the nifty screw apart egg type container that keeps the lid on snuggly. i have two nieces ski all winter and complain about chapped lips. I know for a fact that they go through a lot of ip balm.  I&#x27;m sending them each one if these and I just know they will love.</li>
    <li> Keeps my lips smooth and moisturized for a while! I love using it overnight. I wake up to silky, smooth lips. The scent is a big plus!</li>
    <li> It was great and I loved it it is so smooth but one crazy thing that made me give it one less star, THE SHIPPING PRICE WAS MORE THAN THE ACTUAL PRICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> i got this for easter, mine is so creamy!!!! flavor is great . I wear it almost every day! : )  I will totally get more in the future !</li>
    <li> I just love it!  Its so soft and smells fantastic!!  I would recommend this seller also!  Excelent service!!!</li>
    <li> The best ever!! ♥♥♥♥♥</li>
    <li> I purchased the a four pack of flavored EOS lip balm in December from BJs and I have been using it and letting my children use it to moisturize our lips.  About a month ago my lips got very red and sore, and cracking and I didn&#x27;t know why this was occurring.  I&#x27;ve never had any issue with my lips in the past.  I blamed a new face wash and stopped using it and only using vaseline on my lips.  Last week I used my EOS lip balm again and bam, the severed chapped lips returned.  So I decided to Google the issue only to find out there are many consumers complaining of the same thing from as early as 2011.  I&#x27;m a bit upset that if this is a known issue why the product is still on the market or why there isn&#x27;t some type of warning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve included two links of examples below that i quickly found when Googling the issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://chinaglazelover.blogspot.com/2012/10/my-eos-lip-balms-are-going-in-trash.html&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt&#x3D;A0LEVyTbfBlV5UoATjJXNyoA;_ylu&#x3D;X3oDMTEzb2dwaG8yBGNvbG8DYmYxBHBvcwMxBHZ0aWQDVklQNjAyXzEEc2VjA3Ny?qid&#x3D;20120624153256AAT9wxL</li>
    <li> I love eos and this kind smells like Laffy Taffy its amazing</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t personally used this but gave it to my BFF as a stocking stuffer. She had mentioned that she heard many of her co-workers commenting on how much they liked this product so I thought I would get her one to try for herself. She absolutely loves it. Says she loves the feel (not sticky or too greasy) and the smell is fantastic.</li>
    <li> I love everything about this. It&#x27;s a ball, so I don&#x27;t lose it. It&#x27;s strawberry flavored, which is delicious. It&#x27;s super moisturizing, which is the whole point of chapstick! It really lasts a long time for me, which is kind of crazy because I&#x27;m an obsessive chapstick user. It definitely lasts longer than most chapsticks in the tubes, if you know what I mean. This stuff gets a thumbs up all the way around.</li>

    <li> I really wanted to like these. The packaging is adorable and they smell great, but they&#x27;re not moisturizing. They&#x27;re overpriced... Too many cheaper alternatives to buy something that doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
