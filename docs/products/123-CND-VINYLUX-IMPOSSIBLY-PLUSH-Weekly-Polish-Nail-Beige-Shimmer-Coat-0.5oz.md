### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is the best nail polish ever!  </li>
      <li>I love this nail polish!!!</li>
      <li>(fastest I&#x27;ve ever experienced).</li>
      <li>Vinylux is a great product that stays put when applied correctly.  </li>
      <li>- this is a great color if you are looking for a color that matches your skin tone - NOT if you are looking to highlight your nails.</li>
      <li>Very nice polish.  </li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t a good color either.</li>
      <li>This is a nice, brown, neutral color that is great for the fall.</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>It has a very fine sparkle to it, which isn&#x27;t my cup of tea.</li>
      <li>Good for a quick, last-minute splash of nail color.</li>
      <li>It was the perfect starter color as my nails were so so short</li>
      <li>The color is a lovely neutral, and that is why two stars.</li>
      <li>It looks more &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; when applied.</li>
      <li>I am so glad my friend told me about it.</li>
      <li>Excellent long wearing nail polish.  </li>
      <li>This polish is strong and better than any polish I have ever tried.  </li>
      <li>Easy to remove</li>
      <li>This nail polish chipped easily.  </li>
      <li>Add the special topcoat, and this is a elegant nude/beige look that lasts.</li>
      <li>It does dry super-fast, though, and the top coat creates a beautiful shine.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had cheap drugstore polish stay on longer.</li>
      <li>light color and the adhering factor allowed me to &amp;</li>
      <li>Aside from the fact that the colour I got is barf brown, this is the second day I&#x27;ve had this on (including the top coat) and it is already peeling off!  </li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;touch up&amp;#34; was far more effective than the OPI polish (it actually stayed on).</li>
      <li>While touching up polish is never done without being able to tell, it did keep my nails covered and therefore less splitting and breaking occurred.</li>
      <li>so it lasts pretty well, but color is &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>The actual color is darker, as other reviewers have indicated, and it is a most unattractive shade of brown, primarily because there are strong undertones of gray.</li>
      <li>love the dry time being so very fast</li>
      <li>There is nothing else positive to say about it.</li>
      <li>Be aware its much darker on the nail than it looks.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m done and ready to go at the halfway mark (the first two times I used this polish</li>
      <li>The other four listings show pictures that are far more accurate than the product shot here, which makes the color look beige (as the product is listed as being).</li>
      <li>Color appears to be much darker then it looks and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;shimmer&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>color not what it looked like on screen - looked more pink than it is</li>
      <li>My nails look like I am ready for a Halloween costume.</li>
      <li>It did not wear any better than any other nail polish.</li>
      <li>I want to find someone who wants all of my old OPI and switch exclusively to Vinylux.</li>
      <li>The brand is amazing it last for a week at least !</li>
      <li>Has a slight shimmer, too, which I like very much.</li>
      <li>I feel bad throwing it away, it&#x27;s still perfectly good</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> There are five different Amazon listings for this shade (Impossibly Plush) of CND Vinylux. The other four listings show pictures that are far more accurate than the product shot here, which makes the color look beige (as the product is listed as being). The actual color is darker, as other reviewers have indicated, and it is a most unattractive shade of brown, primarily because there are strong undertones of gray. I gave the polish a try, and my nails look as if there are bruises underneath. I was looking for a polish that would enhance my nails but not dramatically change the color. Sadly, this polish does dramatically change the color and not in a positive way. I should add that I have Caucasian skin coloring so that you can interpret my comments with that info in mind.</li>
    <li> Aside from the fact that the colour I got is barf brown, this is the second day I&#x27;ve had this on (including the top coat) and it is already peeling off!  Truly  crappy product.  Not worth the trouble of returning it.  I&#x27;ve had cheap drugstore polish stay on longer.</li>
    <li> Vinylux is a great product that stays put when applied correctly.  This is a nice, brown, neutral color that is great for the fall.</li>
    <li> I bought several shades of Vnylux nail polish because it was recommended to me.  I was very disappointed.  It ruined my nails.  They peeled, broke and were totally damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I threw the bottles away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am trying to regrow my nails.</li>
    <li> This is the best nail polish ever!  My nails stay polished all week.  No chipping at all.  This polish is strong and better than any polish I have ever tried.  Finally a polish for people who want polish to last but don&#x27;t want to get gel polish.</li>
    <li> Started peeling/chipping off my nails after four days. It does dry super-fast, though, and the top coat creates a beautiful shine. Good for a quick, last-minute splash of nail color.</li>
    <li> The color is a lovely neutral, and that is why two stars. There is nothing else positive to say about it. It began to chip after one day. I tried it twice, and both times it had zero staying power. Now I must add that this particular polish did not come in the box, so I am wondering if there was something wrong with it.</li>
    <li> Very nice polish.  Neutral color quality staying power</li>
    <li> Excellent long wearing nail polish.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Be aware its much darker on the nail than it looks.  I&#x27;m still looking for a neutral opaque vinylux shade...</li>
    <li> color not what it looked like on screen - looked more pink than it is - this is a great color if you are looking for a color that matches your skin tone - NOT if you are looking to highlight your nails.</li>
    <li> The brand is amazing it last for a week at least !</li>
    <li> It peeled off the next day after my shower</li>
    <li> Color appears to be much darker then it looks and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;shimmer&amp;#34;.  Doesn&#x27;t last--chips off and peels like any other polish.</li>
    <li> Deep beige-colored and that&#x27;s darker than I expected, given the photo. Has a slight shimmer, too, which I like very much. Add the special topcoat, and this is a elegant nude/beige look that lasts.</li>
    <li> Long lasting. Easy to remove</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Vinylux so it lasts pretty well, but color is &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34;.  It has a very fine sparkle to it, which isn&#x27;t my cup of tea.</li>
    <li> This nail polish chipped easily.  It did not wear any better than any other nail polish.</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish!!! I am so glad my friend told me about it. I want to find someone who wants all of my old OPI and switch exclusively to Vinylux. I feel bad throwing it away, it&#x27;s still perfectly good polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color I have been wearing for the last 3 weeks is Impossibly Plush, a very light taupe color. It was the perfect starter color as my nails were so so short and this is only slightly darker than skin. I now want Grapefruit Sparkle, Sugared Spice and Steel Gaze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the dry time being so very fast (fastest I&#x27;ve ever experienced). I can paint my nails while Chris drives us to Annapolis and I&#x27;m done and ready to go at the halfway mark (the first two times I used this polish it was done this way, always looking for the efficiency factor).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light color and the adhering factor allowed me to &amp;#34;touch up&amp;#34; the ends of my nails where chips did occur before the end of the week. The chips were far less severe than the OPI polish. The &amp;#34;touch up&amp;#34; was far more effective than the OPI polish (it actually stayed on). While touching up polish is never done without being able to tell, it did keep my nails covered and therefore less splitting and breaking occurred.</li>
    <li> This is darker than what is shown on the bottle</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the appearance of this polish.  It wasn&#x27;t a good color either.</li>
    <li> It stays on as it says for a week plus. But the color was different than what i ordered.  A lot darker.</li>
    <li> Polish is not the color it appears in picture. It is a flat brown. I can not use this color.</li>
    <li> It looks more &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; when applied. It is not as pink as the picture. My nails look like I am ready for a Halloween costume. ~</li>
