    <li> Works just fine on my darker blond hair that is curly and fine.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t lighten hair like it claims to do.</li>
    <li> i got this shampoo &amp; conditioner and with only 3 washes my hair is softer shinier and my highlights are much lighter. i would definitely reccomend it</li>
    <li> This product is much too heavy for my hair. I did not like it at all, and I wish I could return it.</li>
    <li> I love John Frieda products, I use this to keep my hair even toned between appointments, sometimes I alternate in the summer with the high lightening version, to add extra definition. Love the auto ship!</li>
    <li> I grew up with strawberry blonde hair. It is very hard to find a colored shampoo that would maintain the strawberry blonde color. Most red head shampoos leave behind a fire engine red or purple color...ugh! I have found that the John Frieda Sheer Blonde for darker blondes does help. Also the one called Brilliant Brunette actually leaves some strawberry blonde highlights. I switch back and forth between the two and it does the trick!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and always will! My hair is going gray and I run a lt. blonde color through it every 8 wks or so. This shampoo highlites it great.</li>
    <li> I have oily hair and hard water. This shampoo keeps the water buildup out of my hair and let&#x27;s my natural color shine.</li>
    <li> I love it!  Frist tried it at a friend&#x27;s house.  It really does seem to bring out the highlights in my naturally blonde hair.</li>
    <li> It is a fantastic shampoo.  I had trouble finding it.  Was happy that I did.</li>
    <li> It really brings out the blonde highlights</li>
    <li> Great value, great product, great price!</li>
    <li> John Frieda is always my go-to for hair products and this is no different. Great product. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I have natural blonde highlights, and when I was a teenager I started using this shampoo to bring them out because I wanted to be more blonde. They are more visible when I use it, but additionally - it&#x27;s a good shampoo with a pleasant smell and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive scalp.</li>
    <li> This is what my wife uses, she must like it because she&#x27;s used it for some time. now we get it online.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is overpowering and I could only use it a few times before I coudn&#x27;t deal with it anymore.  It&#x27;s really too bad, because the product works well.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo and it used to be reasonably priced on here, but not any more... Must contain diamonds or something...</li>
    <li> Amazon is still less expensive than going to Target with a coupon.  I buy a bunch at once.  Product can also be used as body soap because it doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> One of the John Frieda&#x27;s Shampoo arrived damaged. It has a hole in the middle of the bottle. I think the damage was caused because something hit the box during transportation. The content (shampoo) was sprawled inside the box. You can see the mess in the attached photo. I would like another shampoo, because this one is not usable anymore.</li>
