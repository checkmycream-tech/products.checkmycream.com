      <li>ok...</li>
      <li>then apply 2 coats of your favorite nailpolish (i use china glaze nail polish).</li>
      <li>It adds a great shine to your nail polish, but it doesn&#x27;t really protect your nails.</li>

      <li>so can&#x27;t say much more than that.</li>
      <li>so I love it.</li>

      <li>As a top coat it does work</li>
      <li>Very good at making sure it doesn&#x27;t dry goopy.</li>
      <li>The nail polish arrived very quickly.</li>
      <li>The gloss is not as shiny as I anticipated but it still gives a pretty nice finish.</li>
      <li>Overall it is a great product.</li>
      <li>...goes on easy, dries quick, stays on til</li>
      <li>It helps protect my manis/pedis for over a week or so and it adds a nice shine and dries at a decent rate (I would guess around 5-10 mins).</li>
      <li>I do love this product very much, that is why i bought two of them...</li>
      <li>This was the first glossy top coat I have ever owned</li>
      <li>Really worth every penny!</li>
      <li>This stuff goes on so smooth and dries quickly.  </li>
      <li>great for women who dont want to maintain their manicure too soon because we&#x27;re all busy with other more important things in life.</li>
      <li>I put it on my nails and it was super watery.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really work for stamping in which it causes the designs to smear, but other than that it is a great 2 in 1 product.</li>
      <li>This coat also makes it so easy to take old polish off!</li>
      <li>This item arrived within the estimated delivery time and it is exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>great for long lasting manicures.</li>
      <li>This stuff really &#x27;t&#x27;d me off!</li>
      <li>It really creates that great, hard protective outer layer and brightens the color.</li>
      <li>Other than that, a great item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this.</li>
      <li>I certainly do recommend this product and the seller.</li>
      <li>I really do recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving it three stars because I love china glaze other nail polishes.</li>
      <li>Also, it did not dry very fast at all, or leave a glossy finish.</li>
      <li>I used to think that cheap nail polish was a bargain, but ever since I tried China Glaze, I can&#x27;t imagine buying any other.  </li>
      <li>I have only used it a few times so far and as of right now my polish is still on my nails and chip free after a week so for me this has done what I bought it for!</li>
      <li>I recommend purchasing China Glaze as your new nail polish brand.</li>
      <li>I am still looking for a good base and top coat.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I was looking for a good base and top coat for my nails and someone had suggested this polish.  </li>
      <li>Keeps your colors lasting so much longer!</li>
      <li>I only use it for top coat, but typically keeps my polish intact for about a week.</li>
      <li>Sometimes I&#x27;ll just use it as a clear coat to make my nails glossy</li>
      <li>Item received early from seller.</li>
      <li>If it didn&#x27;t cost so much for shipping it back, I would</li>
      <li>It makes my nail polish last so much longer</li>
      <li>It really helps you maintain that manicured look without having to spend big bucks at a salon.</li>
      <li>This base coat/top coat polish has been great!</li>
      <li>This base Coat/Top coat works great; it prolongs the integrity of my nail polish up to two weeks--it was still pretty, but my nails have grown out so long, so there were gaps on the bottoms of nails; therefore I have to take the polish off and apply new ones.</li>
      <li>There is better base and top coats out there.</li>
      <li>I love that it is both a base and top coat</li>
      <li>But I have had minimal smearing when I use a lot of product and very few, very light strokes.</li>
      <li>Goopy as it sticky, mushy, and a general fear of what nail Polish can become.</li>
      <li>my manicure lasts me all week barely with any chipping.</li>
      <li>Not only does it not dry well</li>
      <li>I love how quickly it dries when using it as a base coat.</li>

<li> Not only does it not dry well</li>
<li> I love how quickly it dries when using it as a base coat.</li>
<li> It prevents staining and my nails hardly chipped within the first week.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll never go back to any other brand of nail polish again.</li>
<li> Also, when used as a base coat, it does prevent staining which is great because a few of my polishes used to stain my nails</li>
<li> so I usually use a different topcoat if I&#x27;m worried about that.</li>
<li> Usually my nail polish will fade or begin chipping away because my hands are constantly in water washing dishes or doing every tasks like cleaning and cooking.  </li>
<li> A note for those who do nail stamping: it does like to smear stamped images unless you are very careful</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
<li> So instead of getting one botth for top coat and one bottle for base coat, I got it all in one</li>
<li> I guess I just wish I ought the top coat and base coat separately</li>
<li> I wear this as a top coat and as a base coat.</li>
<li> This is a decent base coat, but useless as a top coat.</li>
<li> (Hard to find at stores, though)</li>
<li> , it smears like crazy and takes days to dry.</li>
<li> First time I used it, it smeared like crazy, so I waited a couple of days and tried it again over another nail polish and as a base coat.</li>
<li> Did not go on very thick and made ridges when painted.</li>
<li> But it was really thin and drippy.</li>
<li> so i wouldn&#x27;t  have to use my expensive stuff...</li>
<li> Not impressed!</li>
<li> It takes forever to dry and chipped horribly.</li>
<li> i put it on as a base coat after buffing and cleaning my nails.</li>
<li> I was running out of base coat</li>
<li> Horrible stuff.</li>

    <li> I used to think that cheap nail polish was a bargain, but ever since I tried China Glaze, I can&#x27;t imagine buying any other.  This stuff goes on so smooth and dries quickly.  Really worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Bought for my daughter and she loved it. She says it works great. I haven&#x27;t used it myself so can&#x27;t say much more than that.</li>

    <li> i like this stuff ok...i got it to use on my friends...so i wouldn&#x27;t  have to use my expensive stuff...and it works good.</li>
    <li> I thought china glaze was more high-end polish. But it was really thin and drippy. Did not go on very thick and made ridges when painted. Also, it did not dry very fast at all, or leave a glossy finish. Item received early from seller. Would order again from seller but not of the China glaze selection,</li>
    <li> I wear this as a top coat and as a base coat. I will definitely be buying this again. (Hard to find at stores, though)</li>
    <li> I am happy with the product. I recommend purchasing China Glaze as your new nail polish brand. It&#x27;s compition to OPI</li>
    <li> There is better base and top coats out there. I put it on my nails and it was super watery. The next day it came out looking alright. I&#x27;m giving it three stars because I love china glaze other nail polishes.</li>
    <li> This item arrived within the estimated delivery time and it is exactly what I wanted. So instead of getting one botth for top coat and one bottle for base coat, I got it all in one so I love it. I would definitely buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> This base Coat/Top coat works great; it prolongs the integrity of my nail polish up to two weeks--it was still pretty, but my nails have grown out so long, so there were gaps on the bottoms of nails; therefore I have to take the polish off and apply new ones. This coat also makes it so easy to take old polish off! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Would buy again :) Love it</li>
    <li> The product works great. I may not be an expert but I&#x27;ve noticed the difference in durability and shine. It really creates that great, hard protective outer layer and brightens the color. Metallics are emphasized. It even prolongs the life of my cheaper brand nail polishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reason why I didn&#x27;t give a 5 is because of the shipping. Other than that, a great item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> This top coat is AMAZING!!!! Keeps your colors lasting so much longer! Makes your nails feel really strong and healthy!</li>
    <li> This is a great idea by a wonderful company. I love how quickly it dries when using it as a base coat. However if you are looking for a shiny top coat this is not what you are looking for. As a top coat it does work but I felt as though it didn&#x27;t add shine to my nail polish. Overall it is a great product.</li>
    <li> i put it on as a base coat after buffing and cleaning my nails. then apply 2 coats of your favorite nailpolish (i use china glaze nail polish). top it all off with a coat of this as a top coat. my manicure lasts me all week barely with any chipping. only after about 6 days i got some chip on my nails. great for long lasting manicures. great for women who dont want to maintain their manicure too soon because we&#x27;re all busy with other more important things in life.</li>
    <li> I tried it twice! Not impressed! First time I used it, it smeared like crazy, so I waited a couple of days and tried it again over another nail polish and as a base coat. This stuff really &#x27;t&#x27;d me off! Not only does it not dry well, it smears like crazy and takes days to dry. Even after a couple of days wear it still get marks in my nails. If it didn&#x27;t cost so much for shipping it back, I would but it&#x27;s not worth it. I&#x27;ll just toss it and never order CHINA GLAZE products again. Horrible stuff.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good base and top coat for my nails and someone had suggested this polish.  I love that it is both a base and top coat so I can just use it.  I have only used it a few times so far and as of right now my polish is still on my nails and chip free after a week so for me this has done what I bought it for!</li>
    <li> The nail polish arrived very quickly. It prevents staining and my nails hardly chipped within the first week. It doesn&#x27;t really work for stamping in which it causes the designs to smear, but other than that it is a great 2 in 1 product.</li>
    <li> It is great! I only use it for top coat, but typically keeps my polish intact for about a week.</li>
    <li> I was running out of base coat so I decided to give this product a try. I LOVE IT! It makes my nail polish last so much longer and it makes it nice and shiny.</li>
    <li> This base/top coat is great! It helps protect my manis/pedis for over a week or so and it adds a nice shine and dries at a decent rate (I would guess around 5-10 mins). Also, when used as a base coat, it does prevent staining which is great because a few of my polishes used to stain my nails and I had to grow out the stains! A note for those who do nail stamping: it does like to smear stamped images unless you are very careful so I usually use a different topcoat if I&#x27;m worried about that. But I have had minimal smearing when I use a lot of product and very few, very light strokes. I will buy this again when I finish this bottle for sure!</li>
    <li> This was the first glossy top coat I have ever owned and I don&#x27;t know how I did without it. Sometimes I&#x27;ll just use it as a clear coat to make my nails glossy</li>
    <li> I am still looking for a good base and top coat.&lt;br /&gt;I was using a Revlon version that to my surprise works better than this one. My nails chipped after one day with this.&lt;br /&gt;With the Revlon top coat I was using my nails lasted for three days. I was looking for something that would be better.</li>
    <li> This base coat/top coat polish has been great! Usually my nail polish will fade or begin chipping away because my hands are constantly in water washing dishes or doing every tasks like cleaning and cooking.  The gloss is not as shiny as I anticipated but it still gives a pretty nice finish.</li>
    <li> This is a great addition to a base coat of China Glaze. It really helps you maintain that manicured look without having to spend big bucks at a salon. I&#x27;ll never go back to any other brand of nail polish again.</li>
    <li> This polish does just what I want...goes on easy, dries quick, stays on til I take it off!&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
    <li> Love it, love it, love it. Great product, goes on easily and dries quickly. I certainly do recommend this product and the seller.</li>
    <li> This is a decent base coat, but useless as a top coat. It takes forever to dry and chipped horribly.</li>
    <li> I do love this product very much, that is why i bought two of them... I got one only in the mail, not two. I really do recommend this product. and I STILL HAVENT RECEIVED MY SECOND BOTTLE... I ordered 2, and only got 1, not 2. they dont know what QUANTITY means... SO, only order 1 at a time, not multiple.</li>
