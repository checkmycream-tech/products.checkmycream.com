    <li> I have a pair of newly bulging disks. These resulted from spending the last several years in a wheelchair, due to my MS. Ibuprofen takes the edge off a bit but BioFreeze takes away the rest of the pain and let&#x27;s me get my work done.  And the price for the gallon jug blows away the unit pricing of the 32 oz. containers (even Amazon&#x27;s price)!</li>
    <li> It is the best thing I have found for the relieve of joint and muscle pain.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing that I&#x27;ve found for my Arthritis. The combination of heat &amp; cold helps me.&lt;br /&gt;The vendor , Performance health is prompt and I usually receive it in 4 or 5 days.</li>
    <li> a great product that reduce the pain on contact .&lt;br /&gt;mostly great for muscular pain&lt;br /&gt;I will highly recommended .&lt;br /&gt;not good for muscle spasm</li>
    <li> if u know the product u know what i mean. it a great product. the price was good also. thanks jim</li>
    <li> Have been using Biofreeze Pain  Relieving Gel for quite some time and this product does  better job relieving my pain than any other locally applied pain relieving gels and I have tried quite a few. Will continue using this product.</li>
    <li> bio freeze really works great and I&#x27;m so happy I am able to buy it with you I wish it was a little cheaper though it has gone up this year I may not be able to afford it next time</li>
    <li> It really works! I have been having severe muscle cramps. So I start the day with  Bio-Freeze. I can go almost a full day before I apply again.</li>
    <li> My mom swears by this.</li>
    <li> This pain relieving gel is awesome. Chiropractors use it as part of a session.&lt;br /&gt;Buy this! This will last a long time. This has helped my back pain a lot and I use it daily.</li>
    <li> Use it all the time it helps relieve the pain</li>
    <li> Great Stuff. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> If you ever need long term pain relief from general aches and pains up to Rheumatoid Arthritis (the reason we bought this gallon size) then try this product, I think it works better than china-gel but everyone is different, to put it into perspective, if you were to buy the small size tubes you would pay over $400 for this $100 gallon.</li>
    <li> Price is amazing! Helps with my aunt&#x27;s arthritis. She swears by it!! Quick delivery.</li>
    <li> We buy this for a retirement home and believe me it gets used a lot. Helps pain of arthritis fast. It is a little pricey but worth every penny. I highly recommend its purchase.</li>
    <li> excellent, a little costly but it works just put it on your sore spots before bed, cold at first, then warms up a little, promise peaceful sleep, CAREFUL no in eyes, or sensitive areas :)</li>
    <li> I suffer some sever back pain. I attend physical therapy, chiropractors, and pain management. I get trigger point injections, I use electrical stimulation, acupuncture, and an infinite amount of pills, creams, and patches. Through all of that, BioFreeze gives me pretty decent and quick relief. The biggest negative I have at all is the strong, menthol smell. Also, compared to other pain relieving gels, it requires quite a bit of product to cover surface area. If you can get past the smell and the constant reapplying, the deep and lasting pain relief is really good. It works better than than my prescription lidocaine ointment and lasts longer. The only product I can compare BioFreeze to is Tiger Balm. BioFreeze works quite well, but I personally prefer Tiger Balm a bit better. They both smell poorly, but they both work really nicely. I find that Tiger Balm lasts slightly longer than BioFreeze (on my body and in the jar), however BioFreeze rubs in more and leaves less of a greasy texture, though you need more of it. Overall BioFreeze is a good product, and I definitely recommend it to anyone with any chronic pain or for temporary soreness or sprains- but Tiger Balm is also worth a try.</li>
    <li> Best pain relieving gel on the market! Just make sure you do not rub it on open sores! It really does work!  I just bought a gallon because it is cheaper than buying it 4 ounces at a time!</li>
    <li> I never tried biofreeze prior to buying this product.  I have to say it really works.  I use it before my workouts on a partially torn hamstring and it really helps get the area warmed up and un-stiff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Biofreeze for two years now and have recommended it to my friends.&lt;br /&gt; Many nights I need to use it on my back and legs so I can sleep.&lt;br /&gt;This is better than anything else I have used in the past. I like it very much.</li>
    <li> Biofreeze works very well</li>
    <li> been using it for years it really helps</li>
