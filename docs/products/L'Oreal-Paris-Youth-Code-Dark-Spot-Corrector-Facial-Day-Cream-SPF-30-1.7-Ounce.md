      <li>and it makes my skin look nice.</li>

      <li>After checking this out on EWG, I&#x27;m now planning to try something simpler with fewer hazardous ingredients.</li>
      <li>Would like to point out that anyone can be allergic to any given product; often it has nothing to do with the quality of the product, but your own chemistry.</li>
      <li>Nice container, but units should be in grams, not pre-1862 ounces.</li>
      <li>It does have a strong scent but that doesn&#x27;t bother me because I think it smells good.</li>

      <li>I have to say I love this product.</li>

      <li>And nothing more.  </li>
      <li>I have oily skin and this product does make my face look more oily</li>
      <li>I am thoroughly satisfied with this purchase.</li>
      <li>It also makes your skin look kinda dewy and it has spf 30 instead of spf 15 like most moisturizers.  </li>
      <li>This is one of the best face creams out there; it does not clog pores, goes on smooth, not heavy, absorbs well and immediately brights your complexion.</li>
      <li>I used it til the last drop and was impressed on how my skin had changed.</li>
      <li>The sun has more effect to darken spots when you&#x27;re exposed to it wearing correcting treatments.</li>
      <li>Am not even sure if I recieved the correct one.</li>
      <li>She has tried many similar products but likes this one the best.</li>
      <li>I love this product already.</li>
      <li>Also, the off brand &#x27;compare to Garnier&#x27; ones at the drugstore work as well, for a much more practical price than this one.  </li>
      <li>Over all I am glad I try this product and will continue to use it if L&#x27;Oreal keep up with the quality.</li>
      <li>i am so pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>Cant say for sure if it works at spot correcting</li>
      <li>It contains light-reflecting particles, so your face immediately looks better.</li>
      <li>I would venture to say it works just as well as the Clinique Even Better brand.</li>
      <li>wife is very happy using this day cream, if you want your wife looks younger buy L&#x27;oreal antiaging products</li>
      <li>I LOVE Youth Code and have been using the day/night cream since it came on the market.  </li>
      <li>After using it, many acne appeared in my face.</li>
      <li>Love all the L&#x27;Oreal products but this is one of my favorites-use it every day under my moisturizer.</li>
      <li>My skin looks tighter and has a healthy shine and glow to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I have seen much more improvement on my skin-tone.</li>
      <li>I have to see WAY WAY better results on my skin to buy it again when the jar runs out.</li>
      <li>Nice light fragrance in both.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The creme is very rich, yet absorbs well.</li>
      <li>Works great for a day cream with high sun protection.</li>
      <li>I use this in the morning underneath my makeup and find it very moisturizing and pleasant.</li>
      <li>but after exfoliating I had radiant smooth skin with a more even skin complexion.</li>
      <li>I love the smell and how it is a light weight feel.</li>
      <li>My skin is fair, so the spots were very noticable.</li>
      <li>This purchase was Very quickly delivered.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Update: Seller has kindly and quickly offered a full refund.</li>
      <li>The product itself is fine, I&#x27;ve used it before.</li>
      <li>I have not noticed any change to dark spots but this is an amazing moisturizer and my skin feels great after using it a couple of weeks.</li>
      <li>and it was fine,</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It works well on my skin</li>
    <li> Packaging is nice, smell is fine, but it balls up on my skin and flakes off-- My guess is it could be my skin that&#x27;s actually coming off, considering it&#x27;s main selling point is to get rid of dark spots, but I&#x27;m not able to put foundation on after this.  I could use it at night, but I don&#x27;t want to waste something with SPF 30 by sleeping.</li>
    <li> I do not like this cream.  It&#x27;s super heavy (which I guess it is because it is a cream) but if I itch my face or anything a couple hours after applying, it gets bally and has particles that come off.  You can not put it on and then apply foundation, and I use bare minerals concealer.  Really disappointing for the price.  I didn&#x27;t use it long enough to see if it actually gives results.</li>
    <li> I like the way it makes my skin feel and it it&#x27;s a good inexpensive alternative to Mary Kay Time Wise and Clinique Dark Spot Corrector</li>
    <li> My husband wanted to use this to even out his complexion, but when we read the instructions, it just said how to use it as a sunscreen.  Seems more like a dark spot &amp;#34;preventer&amp;#34;, rather than &amp;#34;corrector&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> It does have a strong scent but that doesn&#x27;t bother me because I think it smells good. It does seem to make my skin look smoother but it is very greasy and makes it look shiny, like glittery almost. I just used it as a night cream rather than a day cream.</li>
    <li> Yes, it works in combine with the serum.  My dark spot is disappearing to just light brown.  I used to have laser removing the dark spot, but the dark spot appeared back even darker.  I will continue using this brand because it works!</li>
    <li> This is a good SPF day cream.  I was advised to use SPF 30.  This blends in very well and seems to do the job of giving my face sun protection.  I have started using on my hands as well.</li>
    <li> This cream is excellent,  after a couple of weeks of use i have received  compliments for my skin, is now brighter and moisturized. I recomended.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t know about this, learn. My 21 yo daughter and I both use this. It&#x27;s a great moisturizer and it makes your face look great!</li>
    <li> Did nothing for my dark spots</li>
    <li> All my spots are gone.</li>
    <li> Wish I could bring this mess back. After coming across a promotional pack that sold this and the age spot serum, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I REALLY wish I could take it back. The sent is fine, I&#x27;m not allergic to it, and it feels nice on my skin. WHY WOULD I HATE THIS PRODUCT SO MUCH? IT PEELS, LEAVING PIECES OF IT ALL OVER YOUR SKIN AND HAIRLINE.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not like I wear a full face of makeup, but, even if I did, this product SHOULD NOT DO THIS. I like to use my facial moisturizer on my face, neck, and chest. It peels on my neck and chest. at first I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was the moisturizer or the the serum, so I tried them separately. THEY BOTH PEEL. I&#x27;ve tried changing the amount that I apply, thinking that I was applying too much- still rolled into little, unattractive white pieces. Also, NO CHANGE IN DARK SPOTS- NOPE NOTHING, and I&#x27;ve been USING IT FOR 6 WEEKS. UGH.&lt;br /&gt;I DO REALLY LIKE the LUMINESCENCE of the YOUTH CODE SPF 30 MOISTURIZER, BUT my SKIN ENDS UP LOOKING GROSS BECAUSE IT PEELS INTO VISIBLE WHITE PIECES, AND THOSE PIECES GET STUCK IN MY BRUNETTE HAIR AND ALL OVER MY FACE.</li>
    <li> It has improved my skin tone, but my freckles are still there.  I&#x27;ve been using it for  2 weeks now.  I may have to use this for over a year to see my sun spots go away.  I believe there are better stuff out there for faster results, but does great for complexion and crows feet.</li>
    <li> Very thick, kinda greasy... I use it at night, but not really to wear out. Cant say for sure if it works at spot correcting but I do notice that my red pimple spots disappear quicker than usual.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a dark spot corrector for melasma discoloring on my upper lip from pregnancy. I saw great reviews for this and the price was on the lower end of what some spot treatments cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started to take pictures to see if I could notice a change. I used it for about a month and didn&#x27;t see any change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only that but the cream is thick (which I normally don&#x27;t mind because my skin is so dry and I live in Colorado), but this stuff is thick, oily, and is heavily perfumed. I felt like it never absorbed and my face kind of burned a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never finished the container. Too smelly. Too greasy.</li>
    <li> I normally like the L&#x27;Oreal skin creams I&#x27;ve used in the past, and I&#x27;m not an oily teenager.  I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s but I do have somewhat oily/combination skin with some dry spots and dark spots/sun spots.  I didn&#x27;t notice any real lightening with this product after using for about a month, but I had to use very very little because it made my skin SUPER shiny.  I mean, I looked like an oil slick after putting it on, long before my own skin could get oily on its own.  Sorry, but it was a waste of money for me, unfortunately.</li>
    <li> The product itself is fine, I&#x27;ve used it before. But the way it was packaged and shipped to me was an eye-opener.  The bix itself is a square/rectangle, placed in a medium-sized, flat, padded envelope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the time the product got to me its packaging was all mangled.  If the product itself was damanged during transit I would have returned it for certain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please re-consider the packaging in terms of transit the next time you ship an item.</li>
    <li> No marks or tears when I opened the package. The product came fast and it was in excellent condition as expected. I and my mom are using it and it&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the last 2-3 weeks and I haven&#x27;t seen any progress.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased his because it said it could fade dark patchs on he skin and as of this point&lt;br /&gt;nothing has changed.</li>
    <li> I have to say I love this product. I have been using it for about a week and use it in the morning and at night!  I have really oil skin and thought it was making me even more greasy feeling but realized it was the illuminating effect it is supposed to be.  The product has made my skin smooth and great looking. It even fades the dark circles and wrinkles under my eyes.  I have tried everything and this is by far the best product.  Worth the money!</li>
    <li> too bad you cant see my before/after pics. i am so pleased with this product. i swam competitively whole life outdoors/skiing etc. damaged skin so bad not dark spots...more like world atlas (dots so large look like contintnets).  but...using this product i no longer have world atlas on my face. very pleased with this product/highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Nice container, but units should be in grams, not pre-1862 ounces. I use this every morning on my face. Good protection against further UV damage.</li>
    <li> What I don;t like from this product is that after you applied it, it peels off your dead skin, so If you are ready to apply your foundation it makes a mess. I have to remove ll the peeling off before I apply my foundation, what it makes it too time consuming every time. Dissapointed that this happens all the time :-(</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like its texture, it is kind of thick and leaves sticky feeling on my face.</li>
    <li> I actually like the luminizing version better as it really gives a glow.  Mistakenly ordered this one which seems to work just as well, just without as much glow.  The skin on my chest area, which is where I use this, is really in good shape since I&#x27;ve been using.  I don&#x27;t have that crepe-y skin look in the decollete area.  I am 57 and have done too much sun bathing earlier in life, so am glad this cream has gotten me back to a more youthful look -- at least in that area of my body!</li>
    <li> The lotion is too greasy, and the glowing effect is due to this. It does not say no where &amp;#34;Dark Spot Corrector&amp;#34;. Am not even sure if I recieved the correct one. I have used it and not noticed any difference. The only good thing is that my skin didnt break out even though it felt to greasy.</li>
    <li> Thought I&#x27;d give this a try along with the serum and it works!  Nice light fragrance in both.  Will use both products always.  Good price here at Amazon.com and I like that it&#x27;s delivered to my door.</li>
    <li> it doesnt work for me  it is going back not worth the money  and very thick for my skin,may be other skin types.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my hyper pigmentation from acne on my skin. I am an african american woman and bought this to clear up dark marks from the result of acne. After using it for 6 months, I&#x27;ve found that it doesn&#x27;t do anything for my dark marks. The most it has done was improve my skin texture, which looks amazingly soft now. I will finish the product and move on to something else.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice cream, seems to keep skin hydrated. I am 75 so not looking for miracles, but I enjoy using the cream.</li>
    <li> If you want to buy quality, buy L&#x27;oreal,&lt;br /&gt;My wife is very happy using this day cream, if you want your wife looks younger buy L&#x27;oreal antiaging products</li>
    <li> I think it is not suitable for me. After using it, many acne appeared in my face. so I stop using it now.</li>
    <li> I like this product it has ridded me of my smile wrinkles.  It leaves my skin with a demure glow.  Thank you Amazon for carrying this product.</li>
    <li> i hate the feel of my face after using this</li>
    <li> On my second jar and the results are evident; skin stays hydrated and does lessen the dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t apply too much otherwise you walk around like a shinning Star blinding people. Good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Skin is Skin; can be used by males also.</li>
    <li> I really like how creamy and hydrating this moisturizer is.  It also makes your skin look kinda dewy and it has spf 30 instead of spf 15 like most moisturizers.  I was hoping it would get rid of some of my dark spots, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any change yet...</li>
    <li> The shopping is very satisfactory,hope to have the discount activities to inform me - these are excellent! They&#x27;re a bit expensive, but well worth the investment.</li>
    <li> I use this with the dark spot correcting serum, together the make my skin brighter and have noticeably lightened the dark spots. It&#x27;s a perfect, non-greasy sunscreen too.</li>
    <li> i bought this to help with acne scars and after a few weeks there was a big difference</li>
    <li> I used this every night and every morning for two months, it didn&#x27;t work for my brown spots, I&#x27;m still having them. It has a weird texture is too greasy, oh well I will try something else.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;VE ALREADY ORDERED ANOTHER JAR. NOT HEAVY. PERFECT UNDER MY MAKEUP AND MY BROWN SPOTS ARE VISABLEY FADING. I NEED TO LOOK NO FURTHER.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! I often used it everyday even i stay at home and it&#x27;s works! tks to loreal</li>
    <li> This day cream is thick just like the more expensive creams.  I use L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s other dark spot correcting products and like to use products in the same line.</li>
    <li> I love this cream , makes my skin appear younger and the dark spots on my face that I received while being pregnant are fading ( haven&#x27;t been able to get rid of them for 4 years ) plus the price was great , I&#x27;m kicking myself for the fact that I bought my 3 previouse bottles at Kmart for $25 each when I could get them at amazon for 17 each !</li>
    <li> This was basically an expensive sunscreen to prevent your pigments from getting darker by sun exposure, but it does not reverse or heal existing damage, at least for me. In my experiences through an array of products, Garnier has a better Dark Spot Corrector with SPF that not only protects the current skin condition from worsening, but also corrects (what this product says it does on the box) the current problems, which is more what I was looking for.  Also, the off brand &#x27;compare to Garnier&#x27; ones at the drugstore work as well, for a much more practical price than this one.  So if you want prevention, it&#x27;s an alright buy (although also pretty oily for a sunscreen in my opinion, maybe hydrating for other people?).  If you want treatment though, I&#x27;d try something else.  Not to rant, but make sure whatever product you do get has SPF if you&#x27;re using it during the day because pigment correcting products without SPF are for night time only.  The sun has more effect to darken spots when you&#x27;re exposed to it wearing correcting treatments.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it and it made my skin way better and back to when I was a child.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Non greasy.  Works great for a day cream with high sun protection.</li>
    <li> I wanted a dark spot corrector.  What I got was a SPF 30 sunscreen.  I don&#x27;t spend much time in the sun any more. When I do, I use a sunscreen of SPF 45.</li>
    <li> Too good to be true. Bought from Eabargain Inc for ~$13. Received jar not in the box and no seal that should be there when you open a new jar. It is a used jar! Very disgusting to use cream that someone else stuck their fingers in and are mailing it off to you. I have bought this product many times from stores, but never tried buying it from online before and tried because it was cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I have contacted the seller and will update this review as soon as I hear back from them. I just wanted to write this immediately before anyone else tries to buy this product now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Seller has kindly and quickly offered a full refund.</li>
    <li> I have rather oily skin around the T zone and dry skin otherwise. I used to buy the regular Youth Code and it was ok but made my skin break out once in a while. Then I came across this Youth Code Dark Spot Correcting cream and thought why not give it a try. I have some little discolorations on my face from previous acne and such, so I bought the cream. After a couple of weeks I noticed that my skin&#x27;s tone and texture improved by 100% - no more little acne spots or even break outs. I&#x27;m using it in the summer and we are having 100+ degree weather, but the lotion doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily, it&#x27;s just shiny but just like it says \\&quot;illuminating\\&quot;. I&#x27;m always looking fresh and feeling great. Even though I did not buy mine here, but I will from now on as this is the best price i have found so far.</li>
    <li> I bought this product along with the cleaner and serum and it took me a few weeks to realize (but I did) that it was the cause of my face feeling itchy for days and days. As soon as I switched back to my regular brand of moisturizer, the itching stopped. I have sensitive skin and should&#x27;ve known better than to try it.</li>
    <li> To begin with the positive, I liked that this cream is non-greasy, absorbs really well and gives your skin a nice glow. It also did even out my skintone. The bad part is that is \\&quot;rolls\\&quot; up when you try to put makeup on so your foundation looks cakey and clumpy. For that reason I don&#x27;t think I will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used nearly the entire jar. My dark spot has not faded in the least, even though the label states that this product is a dark spot corrector.</li>
    <li> I had a very bad reaction. I seem to be allergic to 1 or more ingredients in this product. Feels like a chemical burn, itching of neck, face, and eyes (eventhough I did not put it around my eyes). I&#x27;ve made a dermatology appt to make sure it wasn&#x27;t something else, but burning and itching occur after using this cream and takes several days to heal. I reapplied it again after face healed and had the same reaction.  I suspect the sunscreens. I&#x27;ll see what  my dermatologist says.</li>
    <li> This does what it claims, and is a great skin corrector / moisturizer.  However - even if I&#x27;m careful to keep it away from my eye area, it makes my eyes BURN for a LONG TIME after applying.  I don&#x27;t know how it even gets into my eyes, but I have to throw it away or just use it as a spot treatment FAR away from my eyes.</li>
    <li> I was extremely trilled to try this product because I was hoping to find something at a reasonable price, and could potientally work. So I bought and started using right away, the first thing I didn&#x27;t really like was it was kinda greasy, and made my face quite shiny. After a month, I did notice some changes, my mama even noticed which meant to me the product had to be doing something. I used it til the last drop and was impressed on how my skin had changed. Although, after I ran out I didn&#x27;t run out and go buy more, and I felt that without it, the dark spots were showing again. I would buy this product again and recommend.</li>
    <li> This purchase was Very quickly delivered.  Wife LOVES this product!  It&#x27;s expensive, but she says it&#x27;s well worth it.  She has tried many similar products but likes this one the best.</li>
    <li> I have been applying this serum for the last month and its done nothing for my dark spots. I have followed all the instructions and have been good with supplementing the treatment with proper sun protection when going out. Still, the product doesn&#x27;t live up to the claim. Its good as a moisturizing serum, but when it comes to the correcting dark spots- ummm...not so much!!!</li>
    <li> I read all of the reviews, positive and negative about this product. Would like to point out that anyone can be allergic to any given product; often it has nothing to do with the quality of the product, but your own chemistry. If you itch or break out-then likely you are allergic to it.&lt;br /&gt;THAT SAID- I am 58 years old, have very fair, sensitive skin and rosacea. So I have to be very careful with what I put on my skin. At 58, my skin had gotten saggy and very dull and dry. No glow at all. When I looked at pictures of myself I noticed that my skin had gotten very blotchy- age spots that plague fair-skinned folks like myself, even though I have always worn a hat outdoors. Have not been so good with the sunscreen because I hate the way it feels on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I looked at all the products at the drugstore, know that L&#x27;Oreal is associated with Lancome, and finally decided on this creme to try to address my age spots.&lt;br /&gt;The creme is very rich, yet absorbs well. It contains light-reflecting particles, so your face immediately looks better. It moisturizes my (very dry) skin very well, without making it greasy or oily. I even put it on my nose and it does not make it oily, greasy, or cause the pores to enlarge.&lt;br /&gt;After using it for a few weeks, not only have the blotches faded a LOT, but my skin texture is definitely improved, which I don&#x27;t remember being part of the advertised claims. A friend of mine recently told me that my skin was \\&quot;glowy\\&quot;- well, that hasn&#x27;t happened for a number of years! I told her I was using this and she looked close-up and then asked me if I was wearing make-up (meaning foundation: and no, I was not). It may not work for everyone, and frankly I have no idea why someone in their early 20s would try it as it is marketed for mature skin. But I am giving it a glowing report: works well, does not irritate my delicate, sensitive skin, seems to be helping fade my rosacea, improves my skin texture, and gives my face a natural, non-greasy \\&quot;glow\\&quot;. Myskin is now very soft to the touch, as opposed to rough and dry like it was before.&lt;br /&gt;I use this along with a Clarisonic facial skin cleaner and Zia Skin Basics Moisturizing Cleanser (very gentle), and the combination of all of these products has improved the look and texture of my skin noticeably, and has also made it noticeably tighter. Also- it contains a 30 SPF sunscreen, so that will help prevent new skin damage from forming.</li>
    <li> What a great BUY........  It arrived early and I will order this again. It sure helps reduce the dark spots.</li>
    <li> On the side of the box it says \\&quot;This luxurious, fast absorbing &amp; light-infusing cream gives skin an instantly luminous appearance.\\&quot;....Um....No it really makes your skin greasy &amp; shiny looking &amp; the product smells like straight sunscreen which I cannot really wear on my sensitive skin &amp; it causes breakouts which in turn will heal into dark marks which is what I bought this product for to remedy in the 1st place! I do not care about a cream giving me a \\&quot;luminous\\&quot; aka shiny or greasy look &amp; I wish I could have bought the version of this to try that didn&#x27;t have the sunscreen but I didn&#x27;t want &amp; cannot really afford to pay $15 a jar! I got this for $13 &amp; had to call &amp; have Loreal reimburse me for the $13 I paid for this stuff which I deem unusable for my face!</li>
    <li> Love all the L&#x27;Oreal products but this is one of my favorites-use it every day under my moisturizer. Highly recommend for any age</li>
    <li> I used this product of 3 weeks and my skin was glowing, spot free and of course no dark spots ( I have medium skin tone and live in the tropics) .iT IS OIL FREE AND THE DARK SPOTS FADES IN ABOUT TWO WEEKS , no more dull skin. aM DEFNITELY STOCKING UP ON THIS pRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Youth Code day cream for about six months and my skin looks great. I am in the over 55 age group and I have received unexpected compliments on my young looking and radiant skin several times since I started using it. It contains a sunscreen so I no longer need to apply both a moisturizer and sunscreen every morning.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizing sunscreen.  I have very sensitive skin and I can use this with no problems.  It works very well with the accompanying Youth Code Dark Spot Corrector Serum.  After just a few uses, I have noticed a difference in the red and purple spots on my face from previous acne.  It has faded them to almost nothing.  I haven&#x27;t used it alone, but using it with the Serum makes a huge difference with the dark spots on my face.  The only thing I have noticed that is not so appealing, is that it seems to get clumpy and flaky as it dries while applying.  But not a big enough problem to discontinue use.  I will continue to use this duo until my spots are completely gone, and will continue to use if any ever come back.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone who needs this.</li>
    <li> I have not noticed any change to dark spots but this is an amazing moisturizer and my skin feels great after using it a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> Kinda thick but that&#x27;s probably because of the spf in it.  I have a lot of freckles and my face was starting to get really blotchy.  My face looks better and I feel protected from the sun.  I like it and it makes my skin look nice.</li>
    <li> Nice keeps skin clear just as it states. My skin gets sunburn in summer. This works great as a sunscreen and lightener.</li>
    <li> When I first brought this product I was really skeptical but I must say ive had amazing results! Most of my scars disappeared after 6 weeks and my skin tone is so even now!</li>
    <li> I LOVE Youth Code and have been using the day/night cream since it came on the market.  When I saw this, I figured  I&#x27;d give it a try!  Why not get sun protection, lessen the appearance of some dark spots and get the same great Youth Code cream I&#x27;ve been using.  This is sooooooo not what this product is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, let me tell you how GREASY this cream is!!  I don&#x27;t care what the box states...this stuff is \\&quot;why did you smear Crisco on your face?\\&quot; greasy and if your skin has any problems with oil, this is not for you!  My skin is parched/baked/desert dry and I found the cream too greasy for me to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, this is not a light cream, it goes on like a very thick sunscreen.  This cream doesn&#x27;t so much absorb as it just coats your face.  So if you&#x27;re looking for a good, thick white sunscreen that will diminish dark spots, this is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the white of the cream is \\&quot;absorbed\\&quot; into your skin, your face now has that \\&quot;illuminating\\&quot; quality!  Yep, now your face has this weird shiny/greasy look to it....yay!  If you&#x27;re going to try applying makeup over this stuff, good luck.  If your foundation is liquid you will find that as you apply it the cream under the foundation is now coming off.  It looked like I had face lint!!!  The liquid foundation that had managed to stay on quickly looked oily so I decided to skip the liquid and tried powder as a foundation next time.  The powder did go on well (flour to greased pan...lol), but the powder didn&#x27;t last long.  It quickly looked greasy and creased which had never happened before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final problem was the acne, although I can&#x27;t say I was surprised by this since grease will always equal breakouts.  I guess I was just surprised at how bad this product really was.  There are other one&#x27;s on the market that I have used and will go back to in the future. I will keep using Youth Code day/night cream but I certainly will not use this cream again!</li>
    <li> It does not do what they promote</li>
    <li> I developed a dark mustache looking area above my lip towards the end of my pregnancy (usually called melasma or \\&quot;mask of pregnancy\\&quot;).  It felt so embarassing even though I don&#x27;t think it was as noticable to others as it was to me and it became alot darker when I&#x27;d been out in the sun.  I tried to cover it with sunscreen when I though about it but didn&#x27;t always know when I&#x27;d be having sun exposure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, I dealt with it for almost 2 years til I finally did something about it.  I skeptically bought this product and just put a small dab on the area while doing the rest of my moisturizing routine after my morning shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a WEEK I could tell it was fading! It&#x27;s been two months now and it&#x27;s practically gone! Two months may seem like a long time but I haven&#x27;t even used half of the container and it&#x27;s just become part of my morning routine, PLUS it has SPF 30 so it already guards you against the sun.  Wish I had bought this years ago! It also smells nice and is a good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I am  thirty years old, caucasian, with dry, sensitive skin, and have developed some new freckles or sun spots over the past couple years. I started using this product about two weeks ago and have definitely noticed a difference.  My freckles and spots have already faded a little and my overall completion has evened out to something much nicer than when I first started.  My skin is so much softer and the dryness is gone.  That alone says something, since every day cream I&#x27;ve used has not managed to keep my skin permanently supple and soft.  I don&#x27;t know if my spots will completely fade, but I will continue to use it and see what happens.  The last more expensive cream I used regularly was Olay Regenerist Micro Sculpting cream, and Youth Code clearly surpasses it, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> This product really works. After I entered my 30&#x27;s and 40&#x27;s, I started getting dark patches on my face in various places (melasma). My skin is fair, so the spots were very noticable. I tried many products, most of which did absolutely nothing the fade the spots away. I spent alot of money on different things until I tried Youth Code - the spots literally started fading within the first 2 weeks or so. Some of them are so light now you can barely even see them, and I&#x27;ve only had the product since the summer. I am thoroughly satisfied with this purchase. Youth Code is an excellent product that does just what it says it will, and it&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
    <li> On the jar, this product is advertised as a \\&quot;SUNSCREEN\\&quot;!!!!!  And nothing more.  I have not noticed any changes in my skin, as of yet.  I have had it for 2 weeks.  The only ingredient it has is an illuminator.  Does make the skin LOOK bright.  But there are products out there that do the same thing for alot less money.  NOT IMPRESSED!!!!</li>
    <li> Its good as usual because of it&#x27;s famous and good brand. No complain about this brand and yes this brand is always bit expensive.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a year now and as I&#x27;m turning 30 this year, I believe it&#x27;s really helping my skin stay subtle and smooth. Would reommend every one to buy this.</li>
    <li> I love this broad spectrum spf30 face cream.  I have older, dry skin that is sensitive and breaks out to many face creams.  I use this in the morning underneath my makeup and find it very moisturizing and pleasant.</li>
    <li> I love this product already. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks. I use proactiv as well and it really dries out my skin terribly and obviously because of acne I do have dark blemishes. The first application of this youth code completely moisturized my dry irritated skin! And in addition it helped rejuvenate new skin cells and my dark blemishes started fading/shedding away. I cannot pinpoint whether it was proactiv or youth code but my skin did start getting flaky and start to peel but after exfoliating I had radiant smooth skin with a more even skin complexion. Was well worth the few days of flaky skin.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this product. Its super thick - so you feel like you&#x27;re wearing play dough on your face. As far as &amp;#34;dark spot correcting&amp;#34; I didn&#x27;t notice any change to my dark spots. It gives you this luminescent glow that makes you look like someone glitter bombed your face.</li>
    <li> My skin is sensitive so this stuff just irritates my skin. .-_-</li>
    <li> Started applying from the day one when products arrived till today which will be a month already. Doesn&#x27;t seem any difference and gone flaky when apply alittle extra when outing. Not impressed at all.</li>
    <li> There is nothing on the label that indicates it will treat and remove existing dark spots. It only cover them up temporarily with a white cream. 1 star if you think it will treat existing dark spots. 5 stars if you only use it as sun screen to prevent future dark spots.</li>
    <li> love this cream - bought it for my mom and she&#x27;s raving about it&lt;br /&gt;she was a devote obagi user until they discontinued her sunfader product - this did the trick though.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best face creams out there; it does not clog pores, goes on smooth, not heavy, absorbs well and immediately brights your complexion.</li>
    <li> At first it feels kind of thick when I look at the cream, but after putting it on my face, it didn&#x27;t  feel that thick or oily.  Yes, I notice my skin improve.  Feel smoother and more alive.  It also keeps my skin moisturize all day.  The dark spot does look like it fades a little after using for 3 weeks.  Over all I am glad I try this product and will continue to use it if L&#x27;Oreal keep up with the quality.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a bit dissappointed in this product.  Works great as a day cream, but there is no mention of dark spot correcting on the packaging or the product itself.  To me it&#x27;s just a cream.  I&#x27;m sorry, but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> This product has done it&#x27;s job by removing dark spots - hence the four stars, but it is not so great in the warmer months. I started using it in early spring and it was fine, but now it is getting warmer and I have realized that it&#x27;s very greasy and makes you look like a glob of oil. Also, a little goes a long way, put too much on and it will literally pill right off your race.</li>
    <li> I use the Loreal dark spot correcting products both day and night.  I see no change in the sun spots at all.  I am thoroughly disappointed as they had a four star rating, and I really thought they would work.</li>
    <li> My skin has a marked improvement,  I can also tell the difference. My skin looks tighter and has a healthy shine and glow to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;我的皮膚有明顯的改善，我也能看出其中的差別。我的皮膚看起來更緊密，有一個健康的光澤和發光吧。</li>
    <li> I have a freckled and kind of ruddy complexion ;( I haven&#x27;t really noticed any lightening in my age spots. But I do like the smoothness and creaminess of this product. I also like that it doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling greasy. I&#x27;ve tried others and keep coming back to this one...so I must like it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a month now. I am not sure I see a lot of difference. What I do see is that I have to wait at least an hour or so before I put my make up on after using it. My make up gets crumbly when I use this stuff. So I am not not real sure I like this stuff. I have to see WAY WAY better results on my skin to buy it again when the jar runs out.</li>
    <li> Product is great.  Love the SPF 30 and the aroma is very soothing. Have seen a difference in my age spots and will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and how it is a light weight feel. Leaves a little shimmer, nothing to dramatic.  Great for a moisturizer alone or under makeup!</li>
    <li> This definitely works, atleast for me it has. I have been using this product for a little over 3 months and I have seen much more improvement on my skin-tone. I use to have dull skin, uneven skin-tone, and acne marks on my cheeks after using this product as part of my everyday morning regime my skin-tone became more even, acne marks were non-existence and my dull face became more illuminated. I will definitely continue using this product in the long run. Your mileage may vary as everyone skin is different so different results may be achieved.</li>
    <li> I have had the above condition for years. Doctor prescribed Elidel and it works but is harsh on skin. If I wash with mild soap and apply Youth Code daily, I find I need much less Elidel and my skin condition much improved.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not using this for dark spot corrector so I cannot vouch for the efficacy. I am using it as a daytime moisturizer and it glides well. I like the almost nonexistent smell, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have been a loyal user of Clinique Even Better dark spot corrector serum.  I loved how it made my skin super smooth and cleared almost all my dark spots and light scarring.  After using it for a few months, I thought to try a less expensive drug store brand to see if I could capitalize on cost savings without compromisng quality - and luckily I did, this product is amazing :)  I have combination skin, and it tends to get oilier in the warm weather.  I have a few dark spots from the sun and from previous breakouts, and within 3 days of using it, I noticed that my skin was glowing and noticed my dark spots fading rapidly.  I would venture to say it works just as well as the Clinique Even Better brand.</li>
    <li> Good, but pricey. Also I do not see much difference it has made on my skin as compared to other products I have used in past 10 years.</li>
    <li> I think this is the best day lotion out there. Protects my face from the sun and it&#x27;s a great makeup primer. I love it!</li>
    <li> Does good on my skin. I have oily/combo with random dry spots and prone to breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does tend to look oily at first if you get just a little too much. Leave plenty of time before putting on makeup for it to absorb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negative: smells like sunscreen and I really dislike that!</li>
    <li> Whereas the brand is good this product has left my face too oily. Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Works good; used it before, so I stand by it. Good product.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mom. It definitely works!</li>
    <li> Works great!!!  I have oily skin and this product does make my face look more oily but i use oil control from neutrogena so my face looks great. I noticed a difference in three weeks. I would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I&#x27;m not sure whether it is actually helping in the &amp;#34;dark spot correcting&amp;#34; area. It certainly makes my face feel SUPER soft.</li>
    <li> It did not lighten the dark spots on my skin.  It may be good for sunscreen but not lightening of the dark spots.</li>
    <li> Very thick and greasy!  Would not recommend unless you have very dry skin.  Would work best as a night cream.  This product actually made me break out on my neck.  I never saw any spot reduction.</li>
    <li> Seems to work very well.  Good price for this product with sunscreen.</li>
    <li> The dark spot correcting is not obvious, but it does make my skin younger, smoother after 4 months using it.</li>
    <li> This is very good my old skin now looks like a 25 year old....very smooth very clear....You can also use it under your foundation and its not greasy....very good.</li>
    <li> I have been using this as directed for weeks.  I found it to be not better than much cheaper products of the type.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for quite awhile and my skin has improved greatly. Some people mentioned it has rubber eraser-like shedding but I think maybe it&#x27;s the skin being shed and so helped with the skin renewal.</li>
    <li> Bought this as an impulse buy and will not be purchasing again. While it does moisturize like any other moisturizer, after a month of use I do not see any fading of dark spots. Also, beware the eye burn!! I&#x27;m careful not to get it close to my eyes, but somehow something is irritating when I wear this stuff. My eyes water and sting for about 4 hours. The shiny/greasy look was something new for me, so I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about that. Suppose it would take a photo or a friend to tell me if it was obnoxious. After checking this out on EWG, I&#x27;m now planning to try something simpler with fewer hazardous ingredients.</li>
    <li> feels clean on my skin, but apply sparingly so it won&#x27;t chalk white your face.  Came in good size.  Worth the $.</li>
</ol>
