<li> Her hair also dries in half the time and doesn&#x27;t have any frizzy flyaways like it did with other dryers.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money in other product.</li>
<li> Cut my drying time almost in half and cut the frizz as well.</li>
<li> I have very long thick hair.  </li>
<li> My other daughter has thick, medium length, curly hair.  </li>
<li> I was not pleased with my hair/frizz and could not find a hair product to releive all the frizz.  </li>
<li> It is also very heavy and the opening is very small.</li>
<li> Disappointed because the back piece that has a wire screen (I guess to prevent hair from being sucked in) keeps falling off and my hair got caught in it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Powerful and easy to use. Easy on hair!</li>
    <li> I receive the product on time and I like it a lot. The product is even better than I eas thinking</li>
    <li> I have long dry frizzie hair.  I use a lot of hair serum. My hair dressers uses organic highlighting products on my hair and told me about this hairdryer.  So I went on line looked at the price said, \\&quot;wow\\&quot;. Sent her the link, she highly recomended this one which she uses in her salon. It was worth every penny.  One day I did not use hair serium, dried my hair as usual in half the time and my hair was frizz free, smooth and so soft.  Amazing and unbelievable in the same sentence.  I text my friend and told this to her.  She said, &#x27;This is why I recommended this brand to you.\\&quot; This hair dryer alleviated a lifetime of hair problems. I was not pleased with my hair/frizz and could not find a hair product to releive all the frizz.  Who knew it was the hairdryer&#x27;s I had been using.  She mentioned it is an investment and I will have it for years.  I usually purchase a new hairdryer every year. So this actually saved me money with beneficial results. The only down fall was it did not come with the two attachments, it only came with one.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good about this dryer. It&#x27;s powerful, dries my hair rapidly, and smooths it out.</li>
    <li> He was right, the hairdryer does make a difference! It dries more quickly than my previous dryer and the noise level is better than most.</li>
    <li> We have had many hair dryers from this manufacturer, this model is lightweight and very powerful, dries my wifes large mug in just a few moments.</li>
    <li> Bought this bec it was recommended by stylist I met in USVI. Disappointed because the back piece that has a wire screen (I guess to prevent hair from being sucked in) keeps falling off and my hair got caught in it.</li>
    <li> I have very long thick hair.  I have owned many hair dryers, but Elchim is by far my favorite.  It dries my hair very quickly and leaves it straight, soft, and smooth.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I love the power and weight (I like a heavy dryer-heavy enough to press against the roll brush effortlessly)of this dryer, but the air concentrator is only about 2 inches wide. Takes a long time to dry each section of hair using a roll brush. Otherwise, I would give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> this was the best blow dryer ever! Cut my drying time almost in half and cut the frizz as well.</li>
    <li> I like this hairdryer for the most part. The only thing that bothers me, and it may be the blow dryer itself, is that sometimes when I try to switch settings (speed, heat) it&#x27;ll turn off, and I have to reset it again. It gets pretty annoying, but for the most part it works really well on my hair.</li>
    <li> It is fantastic - quiet, efficient and my hair looks great. Totally worth the price. I wish I&#x27;d invested in a quality hair dryer earlier but am delighted to have one now.</li>
    <li> Love this blowdry , I&#x27;m a hairdresser and this is the only company I&#x27;ve used for years! U can also fix anything that happens with it when sending it in with a 18$ check and u pay for shipping , it&#x27;s worth it</li>
    <li> This hair dryer has a great reputation and is used at my salon so I bought it.  The one I received had a burning smell.  I returned it and bought another one - on that one the heat would not go hotter than &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34;.  It is also very heavy and the opening is very small.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money in other product. This is the best.</li>
    <li> The product is nice but i wish it got hotter, i have been cutting hair for 30 years and the power is great but it dosent get hot(needed to smooth the hair). overall a great dryer.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this hair dryer. It is much better than her older one. Its light weight and seems to be high quality construction. Used it for months now with no issues.</li>
    <li> I purchased 2 Elchim 3800 dryers for my teenaged daughters as Christmas gifts.  They love them! One of my daughters has very thick, very long, straight hair that has always taken at least 15-20 minutes to blow dry.  With this dryer she is done in less than half of that time and her hair looks and feels so much healthier.  My other daughter has thick, medium length, curly hair.  Her hair also dries in half the time and doesn&#x27;t have any frizzy flyaways like it did with other dryers.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It reduced my time drying by 10+ minutes and leaves your hair shiny and healthy.  Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> My hair dresser recommended this blow dryer. She said it&#x27;ll be the best one you&#x27;ll ever buy. She was right. It&#x27;s awesome. Very powerful. It&#x27;s worth the money. Trust me!</li>
    <li> I only use Elchim, but this is the most powerful! Love it. Don&#x27;t hesitate. Does t get hot as the other reviews mentioned. Maybe they received a lemon.</li>
    <li> I love Elchim hair dryers. I am very satisfied</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s light-weight and powerful. This is my second one (a kiddo broke the first one). If this one breaks, I&#x27;d buy a third.</li>
