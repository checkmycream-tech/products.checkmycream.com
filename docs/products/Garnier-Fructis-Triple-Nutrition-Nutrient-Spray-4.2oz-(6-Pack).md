    <li> Great product. Garner discontinued and Amazon is the only place I can find it.</li>

    <li> This doesn&#x27;t seem as good as I remember it to be.</li>
    <li> I use this every day and it does wonders for my unmanageable frizzy hair! Love it!</li>
    <li> Awesome! Can&#x27;t find these anywhere- thank you!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I can&#x27;t live without it, but since Garnier has added new products, it&#x27;s been hard to find in the stores. I&#x27;d buy this in a 100 pack if I could!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have chemically straightened hair (naturally it&#x27;s an afro). This product keeps it from getting frizzy and adds shine without making it oily at all. I don&#x27;t use it before I straighten, but I spray it on in the mornings or whenever my hair needs to be refreshed. It helps keep my hair looking smooth and flowing for days without build-up.</li>
