      <li>At work, getting slapped in the booty is not an uncommon thing, so I walk around in fear and agony.</li>
      <li>They look great</li>
      <li>Good, but it may make up the display for the truth, but a great experience and you need a bit of adjustment&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have a pair they don&#x27;t look good in.</li>
      <li>They are still in good shape.</li>
      <li>This is a good product to buy.</li>
      <li>the item is perfect fit wells  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love how great my butt looks in every pair of my jeans</li>
      <li>It is awesome looks reall and amazing in all pants, it&#x27;s that perfect lift for those pants that are so fricken cute but make ur butt look like its apart of ur back.</li>
      <li>ya 11 dollars free shipping in 3-5 days sounds great but you will get what you paid for.</li>
      <li>I have no fanny of my own</li>
      <li>Nothing feels better than sitting on mounds of padding slid between my skin and my jeans, because I know that my booty is looking so sexy!</li>
      <li>These are very comfortable</li>
      <li>&quot; are some of my preferred choices, but my absolutely favorite has to be the good ol&#x27;, innocent and sweet,</li>
      <li>that I was born with, and I&#x27;ll always remember how important it is to have an appealing physique because I&#x27;m spending all this money on it!</li>
      <li>(most of my jeans), but in my thinner material pants/slacks, he can tell.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay, but didn&#x27;t do what I hoped.  </li>
      <li>Plus, I do love trying out &amp;</li>
      <li>Why on earth would I want to embrace the body I was born with and try to healthily nurture my self-esteem when I can exert no effort whatsoever and buy these panties?</li>
      <li>Works great, padding almost makes it feel real.</li>
      <li>and this doesnt seem to be fitted in the appropriate way...</li>
      <li>The bottom line is that I love this product, and with it, I&#x27;ll never have to worry about learning to love the butt (or lack thereof)</li>
      <li>they are okay..</li>
      <li>I BOUGHT IT MORE AS A GAG GIFT</li>
      <li>And I love the colors--such fabulously girly names!</li>
      <li>In original packaging!</li>
      <li>If you are looking for something large with a nice shape that is more wearable under form fitting clothes, I like the Sweetheart panty for Love Fifi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Looser pants: They look fine with my work slacks</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t come in the super cute packaging shown.</li>
      <li>Turning in every angle the best difference was from the side from the back there is a large separation from each pad</li>
      <li>However they were comfortable</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been happy with them overall</li>
      <li>Comfortable, relaxing, and looks great.&lt;br /&gt;Adds</li>
      <li>With these, I can make sure that every man I pass will be focusing on my ass and won&#x27;t have to worry about troublesome things like my face or my smile or whatever words may come out of my mouth.</li>
      <li>these are cheap made &amp; do not work.</li>
      <li>be cheap like me</li>
      <li>Just didn&#x27;t fit me quite right, but better than nothing.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.the real original are soft, cool, comfortable and easy to care for.  </li>
      <li>I only wanted it for a gag gift. :P</li>
      <li>I love how my butt looks and it gives me so much confidence!</li>
      <li>I originally ordered this product because I was in disbelief that these existed.  </li>
      <li>but figured I would try the original Booty Pop.</li>
      <li>nothing special</li>
      <li>So dissatisfied I asked for a full refund the seller asked for a picture of the damaged product they tried to send a replacement</li>
      <li>so yay cool.</li>
      <li>They were true to size and shiped within time.</li>
      <li>Thanks, Booty Pop, for making life so easy and relaxing for me.</li>
      <li>you want them or not just think about how cheap it is and how much confidence you have...</li>
      <li>Worth it for the price.</li>
      <li>I absolutely cannot say enough good things about this product.</li>
      <li>(most of them blended materials and NOT tight).</li>
      <li>other wise</li>
      <li>Got in right on time, would purchase from seller again.</li>
      <li>For the price its not bad but its also kind of embarassing if a guy was to find it in my closet, so I try to keep it hidden.</li>
      <li>While they are very comfortable, the padding is very, very obvious.</li>
      <li>Better as a gag gift than an actual booty enhancer.</li>
      <li>After a month or two, the pads will wear out, making the pads shift around and ALOT more obvious than ever.</li>
      <li>The first time I wore them, I knew I had a found a solution to my problem.&lt;br</li>
      <li>your butt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am small (5&#x27;3\\&quot;, 110) and these are ultimately perfect to give me a moderate enhancement.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>and I wanted to look extra good last night</li>
      <li>First on soak cycle, then on a hand-wash or gentle cycle.</li>
      <li>But pretty much works with jeAns</li>
      <li>Under certain materials.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought them knowing that they would certainly be for jeans, and not under spandex.</li>
      <li>The girlfriend likes them, I think they are dumb lol.</li>
      <li>At least the Small Size fit perfect for me.</li>
      <li>Fits great under anything although with tight jeans I have to adjust it a bit but no big deal.  </li>
      <li>I was expecting to get a cheaply made unattractive padded short but much to my surprise</li>
      <li>thanks for thie product</li>
      <li>He has grabbed my bum out of curiosity and says in some pants it feels real</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference with or without these panties.</li>
      <li>HAHA</li>
      <li>haha)</li>
      <li>Booty pop shame on you for such a cheap crappy product never again as seen on tv and</li>
      <li>Looks real in jeans but nothing else ...</li>
      <li>I just love knowing that I have this product to do all the work for me, because it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;ll ever notice masses of foam hanging around down there.</li>
      <li>But I will give it a decent review based on her opinion and not mine.</li>
      <li>Padding is high &amp; size</li>
      <li>They are just way too high</li>
      <li>This product is great to add a little something extra back there.</li>
      <li>every time I stand; every time I sit... I could wear a belt tight enough to give me muffin top, but still slide my pants right off without un-belting or unbuckling them.</li>
      <li>If you want a good pair of padded unders get the seamless boy shorts type with the big round pads, they rock.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> size small??? I&#x27;m a womens size 5-6 in underwear and this doesnt seem to be fitted in the appropriate way...under a dress or in jeans, not flattering at all!!! wasnt at all what i expected :(</li>
    <li> Ordered Black, got nude .. and these are way too small. Window closed to return. Jeez. I&#x27;m not huge, I m 5&#x27;2&amp;#34; and weigh maybe 115-120.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a small chick, these help me fill out pants in a way that looks and feels natural. They aren&#x27;t obnoxiouly thick. I do suggest hand washing, only because the pads are not removable but they can get wrinkled and warped in the machine.</li>
    <li> I was expecting to get a cheaply made unattractive padded short but much to my surprise I got a sexy bangin pair of underwear that truly do make my booty pop!!! Awesome!</li>
    <li> Works great, padding almost makes it feel real. However people will notice immediately that your butt grew over night.</li>
    <li> The girlfriend likes them, I think they are dumb lol. But I will give it a decent review based on her opinion and not mine.</li>
    <li> Complete waist of money. Undies show lines with every clothe you wear, even jeans</li>
    <li> Between this and crest strips I was still unable to induce trust from anyone. I&#x27;m not sure if I should be mad at the products alone or give old school rap music a chunk of the blame. After all, it does claim that between the two items I shouldn&#x27;t be trusted. YOU DON&#x27;T KNOW ME, BELL BIV DAVOE!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using padded panties for almost two years, I usually buy the seamless ones off of \\&quot;that\\&quot; auction site. I&#x27;ve been happy with them overall but figured I would try the original Booty Pop. I so should have saved my money!&lt;br /&gt;These are the most ridiculous padded panties ever, they have two obvious pads sewn in them. Every pair of pants I tried them with looked awful. While they are very comfortable, the padding is very, very obvious. They can&#x27;t be worn and were a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other seamless boy-shorts ones I have can be worn under anything except spandex, I even wear it with my tight velour lounge pants from alloy. You can&#x27;t tell I&#x27;m wearing it. Please save your money and don&#x27;t buy this item. If you want a good pair of padded unders get the seamless boy shorts type with the big round pads, they rock.</li>
    <li> Well I couldn&#x27;t wait to get this item today n when I did, it was wearth the wait! Shipping was average. In original packaging! But pretty much works with jeAns ): other wise it&#x27;s pretty obvious!</li>
    <li> I have been going back and forth with them to give me my money back and it&#x27;s still in the orignal package ! Don&#x27;t trust the measurements nor excpect good customer service!</li>
    <li> I love this product.the real original are soft, cool, comfortable and easy to care for.  but be careful company&#x27;s are doing bait and switch. order only from booty pop, or you will get a cheep inferior (and really hot &amp;uncomfortable to wear) product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty flat in the bum area and my hips are relatively small compared to my waste. I have always struggled with keeping my pants up - belts help, but I&#x27;m pulling at my pants a lot: every time I stand; every time I sit... I could wear a belt tight enough to give me muffin top, but still slide my pants right off without un-belting or unbuckling them. Then my friends bought me these - half-jokingly - because they thought they might help. Plus, I do love trying out &amp;#34;as seen on TV&amp;#34; stuff. The first time I wore them, I knew I had a found a solution to my problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looser pants: They look fine with my work slacks (most of them blended materials and NOT tight). They make a small difference in the look with looser pants. Which I prefer, because these people see me every day and if my booty seriously grew overnight, they would know something was up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jeans: Two thumbs up. I don&#x27;t have a pair they don&#x27;t look good in. My husband loves them - he is totally aware it&#x27;s fake. He has grabbed my bum out of curiosity and says in some pants it feels real (most of my jeans), but in my thinner material pants/slacks, he can tell. FYI - I have to do a double take sometimes in certain jeans - &amp;#34;Wait a second!! Is that MY a@#?!?! Awesome!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;fitted or tight slacks/thinner stuff - not sure. I&#x27;ve worn them under skirts with leggings but never checked out my booty sans skirt. I do like them with a skirt though. Not sure how, but it makes a bit of difference for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wear and tear - I have four pairs. I wear underwear underneath them. I put them in a lingerie bag. First on soak cycle, then on a hand-wash or gentle cycle. I never put them in the dryer. I&#x27;ve been using them for a couple of years and I use a pair a few times a week. They are still in good shape.</li>
    <li> the under wear paddings were totally out of shape  they have creases  when you wear, the threads between the stitches are popping out, believe you dont want to be in my position after spending 18$ the item is not worth it.  i hate it of all the itemms i have purchased  i hate it and after that i dont want to buy anymore from amazon,,,  i recently bought  same padedd underwear from ebay the item is perfect fit wells  the paddings dont form creases  and i only paid 5.90$ for it,,,,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the worst part is despite contacting the seller and amazon they both did not care</li>
    <li> These are very comfortable but unfortunately you can see the padding clearly under clothing. They look ok under thick clothing. I personally don’t like them, too much padding and weird shape.</li>
    <li> They were true to size and shiped within time. They are not perfect but the are comfortable. I ONLY wear these under my jeans. They look great but if some one were to smack your butt they would definitely know there was something different about it. Worth it for the price.</li>
    <li> I where these like everyday people said your but got bigger</li>
    <li> These butt pads are the best invention ever! I love how my butt looks and it gives me so much confidence! I absolutely love how great my butt looks in every pair of my jeans and I think if your not sure weather you want them or not just think about how cheap it is and how much confidence you have...I will keep buying this product and I recommend 100%</li>
    <li> a bit larger than expected not true to size..padding is not that soft its very firm to touch..not at all even close to feeling somewhat natural..only wear with jeans because any other material will be too thin and it would look too noticeable</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand the bad reviews I&#x27;ve been using them for four years and literally get compliments on my butt all the time!  I only wear them with jeans and you cannot see the padding so I&#x27;m thinking the people bad mouthing them are wearing them with dress or spandex pants??</li>
    <li> The only protected package my shipment came in was it&#x27;s envelope I received my product in a plastic bag sealed by tape! It didn&#x27;t come inside it&#x27;s booty pop packaging (Thanks to the seller) the only way knowing it was from booty pop was by its sticker and size label on the underwear, Unable to tell if it was used or not it also came in the Worng size I got a medium i paid for a small and it was damaged there was a hole in it. so desperate to try the product anyways I put it on over my underwear and! over my leggings hoping for a miracle and all I got was disappointment. Turning in every angle the best difference was from the side from the back there is a large separation from each pad and it just looks weird. In skirts tight our loose the pads are very noticeably fake I tired them in every type of outfit pants, tights, skirts, dresses, jeggings, shorts. You name it. So dissatisfied I asked for a full refund the seller asked for a picture of the damaged product they tried to send a replacement and I said hell no I want my money back (I&#x27;m still waiting on a response) I wouldn&#x27;t wear this product around close family or friends I wouldn&#x27;t want my older sister&#x27;s smacking my butt in mid compliment to hear the hollow sound of the pad &amp;#34;how did your sisters die? &amp;#34;Death by laughter&amp;#34; I would answer. I would only wear this product at night... to a Halloween party. Booty pop shame on you for such a cheap crappy product never again as seen on tv and never again will I purchase from this seller.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be cheap like me ya 11 dollars free shipping in 3-5 days sounds great but you will get what you paid for.</li>
    <li> Looks totally fake, does not stay in place and moves around, not fitted at all. The small feels like a medium.</li>
    <li> LOOKS SO FAKE HAHA NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE AND MOVES AROUND. I BOUGHT IT MORE AS A GAG GIFT BUT WHEN WE TRIED IT OUT FOR FUN UGH SO UNCOMFORTABLE. IF YOU WANT ONE BUT CHEEK UP AND ONE DOWN THAN GO FOR IT HAHA I WOUKLDNT RECCOMEND IF YOU ACTUALLY ARE LOOKING TO HAVE REAL USE OUT OF IT.</li>
    <li> I absolutely cannot say enough good things about this product. Never before have I felt like such a natural woman. Why on earth would I want to embrace the body I was born with and try to healthily nurture my self-esteem when I can exert no effort whatsoever and buy these panties? Nothing feels better than sitting on mounds of padding slid between my skin and my jeans, because I know that my booty is looking so sexy! Who needs to go to the gym when I can slip these on every morning? With these, I can make sure that every man I pass will be focusing on my ass and won&#x27;t have to worry about troublesome things like my face or my smile or whatever words may come out of my mouth. And when I try to talk to guys at parties, get-togethers or bars, I know what I&#x27;ll be using to get their attention with. It&#x27;s simple and foolproof! I&#x27;ll never be alone at a social gathering again! I just love knowing that I have this product to do all the work for me, because it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;ll ever notice masses of foam hanging around down there. And I love the colors--such fabulously girly names! \\&quot;Blueberry Gumdrop\\&quot; and \\&quot;Cotton Candy\\&quot; are some of my preferred choices, but my absolutely favorite has to be the good ol&#x27;, innocent and sweet, \\&quot;Cherry Pop.\\&quot; Lastly, I know that if and whenever I ever get a boyfriend, he&#x27;ll be so turned on when he sees my booty when I take off my skinny jeans because there&#x27;s no way he&#x27;ll tell the different between my Booty Pop panties and me! The bottom line is that I love this product, and with it, I&#x27;ll never have to worry about learning to love the butt (or lack thereof) that I was born with, and I&#x27;ll always remember how important it is to have an appealing physique because I&#x27;m spending all this money on it! Thanks, Booty Pop, for making life so easy and relaxing for me.</li>
    <li> This product is great to add a little something extra back there. Got in right on time, would purchase from seller again. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I had the Booty Pop Panty Medium Size for 2 years. They was too big for me. So, I ordered the Booty Pop Panty Small Size. At least the Small Size fit perfect for me. Everyday, I wear the Booty Pop Panty over my underwear to enhance my blue jeans. This is a good product to buy. Will definitely be buying me a 2nd pair of Booty Pop Panty.</li>
    <li> Overral i like its product. It gives me some ummph behind  there and makes me feel confident. On the downside the pads tend to bunch up or flip causing your butt to look.mishaped</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t come in the super cute packaging shown. That&#x27;s why I bought it! I only wanted it for a gag gift. :P</li>
    <li> these are cheap made &amp; do not work. i think its a waste of money, you can tell if someone is wearing these. they were also a little to big for me..</li>
    <li> So these enhancers look natural under jeans. I would say they look really natural. Under certain materials. Under thicker, heavier jeans, they look extremely natural, but under thinner fabrics, or jeans they are obvious. You can fix this buy wearing tight panties over it (Although it makes my booty sweat haha) They stay in place. You can make your butt look bigger, or smaller by shifting them up or down. But the thing is, they feel extremely unnatural to the touch. At work, getting slapped in the booty is not an uncommon thing, so I walk around in fear and agony. If you slap it, it sounds like someone punched a mattress. After a month or two, the pads will wear out, making the pads shift around and ALOT more obvious than ever. You can either buy a new pair, which is what I will do, or wear tight panties over it. I would recommend these to a friend. If that person only wore thick jeans ha.</li>
    <li> I was not impressed with the way the padding in the back layed or fit, it not appear real. However they were comfortable</li>
    <li> I WOULDN&#x27;T EVEN GIVE THIS A STAR BUT HAVE TO FOR U GUYS TO KNOW HOW SHAMELESS THIS PRODUCT WOULD MAKE US FLAT BOOTY GIRLS LOOK I PUT THIS ON UNDER MY JEANS IT LOOKED LIKE I HAD TO LIL LUMPS NEAR MY A CRACK WHILE MY HIPS MADE IT LOOK EVEN WORSE OMG</li>
    <li> Comfortable, relaxing, and looks great.&lt;br /&gt;Adds body and turns heads,..haha.&lt;br /&gt;put them on and wear tight clothes to cover up any possible visible mark.&lt;br /&gt;If they are used with lycra or spandex, fine clothes, they will be slightly noticed.&lt;br /&gt;Jeans, dresses, pants with pockets,...simply great !!!!</li>
    <li> I have no fanny of my own and so I figured this would be just the ticket.  I wasn&#x27;t wrong.  It&#x27;s wonderful.  Fits great under anything although with tight jeans I have to adjust it a bit but no big deal.  I love it!!!!!!</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference with or without these panties. and neither did any of my friends or co- workers.</li>
    <li> These are the worst padded panties ever they are so fake looking I tried them with everything from jeans,dresses to skirts they look horrible fakest padded panties I ever seen</li>
    <li> I like the shape that it gives my bum in jeans. I hate how I have to only wear jeans with them. Like I can&#x27;t wear stretchy pants or dresses with them. If I did you could see the outline of the padded area.</li>
    <li> Happy with the product. Delivered on time.service was great!</li>
    <li> On jeans this looks passable.  You have to worry about it moving around all the time because then it looks really weird and fake.  I would never try to wear these under thin clothes, you could literally see this.  For the price its not bad but its also kind of embarassing if a guy was to find it in my closet, so I try to keep it hidden.</li>
    <li> I love it. Just what I was looking for. And the price was great. Best worn with jeans though. When worn with tights or other cotton materials it creases at the bottom</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t have a booty, this will not make you have one. It works if you have some already</li>
    <li> so idk if the recipient has even worn it yet but she lol&#x27;d at the fact i got her this because she has a total white girl from an 80&#x27;s workout tape body meaning she has no butt so yay cool.</li>
    <li> It is awesome looks reall and amazing in all pants, it&#x27;s that perfect lift for those pants that are so fricken cute but make ur butt look like its apart of ur back. Now I don&#x27;t have that problem I would def recommend</li>
    <li> I originally ordered this product because I was in disbelief that these existed.  As a voracious fan of Bombshell bras... I was intrigued.  I received the product and tried them on and loved them!!!  My only complaint is that they give one hell of a wedgie, so I wear them as spanx over another pair of panties.  If you are a size 1 in jeans, the small is a little big, but wearing them as spanx over another pair of panties before you put your jeans on fixes that.</li>
    <li> Good, but it may make up the display for the truth, but a great experience and you need a bit of adjustment&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> lol I lost weight and I wanted to look extra good last night so I put this on and BAM. It looked and felt great.</li>
    <li> thanks for thie product it is all it thought it waas going to be an i would sugest it to everyone esle</li>
    <li> I didnt thought this would really make a different when i wear it under my jeans, but it does.Wouldnt recomment that under a skirt, but perfect for Jeans and Jeggins.</li>
    <li> Before I comment on this product I do have to say that I do have a butt so maybe that&#x27;s why the panties looked so bad. You have to have like no butt whatsoever for them to not look terrible. They are just way too high and it looked like my butt started at my lower back, again this could be because my butt pushed them up. I just wanted to see if they made my butt look a little bigger but it just looked deformed.</li>
    <li> Looks real in jeans but nothing else ... Padding is high &amp; size runs a little big they are okay..nothing special</li>
    <li> El producto jamas fue enviado a mi casilla postal en Miami, es por esa razon que seria imposible emitir algun tipo de comentario, actualmente ya no necesito el producto</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, but didn&#x27;t do what I hoped.  Just didn&#x27;t fit me quite right, but better than nothing.  Would recommend it with reservations.</li>
    <li> Better as a gag gift than an actual booty enhancer.</li>
    <li> Here is what I like about these vs. other butt enhancing panties: the pads are focused towards the area of your butt that makes it look bubbly and \\&quot;cute\\&quot;, rather than a large long/wide pad that simply makes it look \\&quot;bigger\\&quot;m this actually gives it the shape you&#x27;d want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought them knowing that they would certainly be for jeans, and not under spandex. At less than 10$, you&#x27;re not going to get the natural look of Fredericks of Hollywood&#x27;s version of this or of a silicone butt insert. Also, they&#x27;re cotton, and like any cotton padding, the feel will be unnatural in the event someone grabs your butt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am small (5&#x27;3\\&quot;, 110) and these are ultimately perfect to give me a moderate enhancement. If you are looking for something large with a nice shape that is more wearable under form fitting clothes, I like the Sweetheart panty for Love Fifi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit concerned by all the negative reviews, and by the weird shape in the photo itself advertising this, but it is just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are truly flat assed, this will probably not be for you, nor will it be for you if you&#x27;re looking for something under super tight thin clothing. I wear the skinnest of skinny jeans with this though, no problem!</li>
    <li> Sooooooo fake looking, especially on my leggings. Even on jeans I could see where the padding stopped. I would never wear this and this was totally not worth my money.</li>
