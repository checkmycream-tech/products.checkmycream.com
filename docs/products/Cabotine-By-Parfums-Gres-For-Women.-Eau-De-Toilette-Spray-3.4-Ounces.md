      <li>EXCELLENT PRICE.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Best price is on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Excellent price and great service.</li>
      <li>It smells great even when it wears off a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My girlfriend is happy with the product and I would buy from this seller again.</li>
      <li>Awesome price love the scent</li>
      <li>I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
      <li>Everything about it seems fair and honest:</li>
      <li>It arrived on time, nicely packaged, un-opened and I absolutley LOVE the scent!</li>
      <li>cheap but great.</li>
      <li>All in all, it is nice and it does the trick for an every day scent.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a floral, minty kind of smell that yes may works better with some people.&lt;br /&gt;People always compliment it and love it!&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
      <li>Try it, you&#x27;ll really love it.</li>
      <li>the guys love it.</li>
      <li>I was expecting a warmer, more gingery fragrance.  </li>
      <li>Cabotine has a very fresh, yet sophisticated, long-lasting  scent that has  become her signature fragrance.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the only perfume she&#x27;s ever used,no matter what else comes along, so it must be good!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s somewhat strong</li>
      <li>This fragrance is so clean and light.  </li>
      <li>but when I first sprayed it I immediately associated it with Givenchy&#x27;s Ysatis, which strikes me as much more of a yellowy-amber scent.</li>
      <li>It smells really clean but somewhat like a cheaper drugstore perfume.  </li>
      <li>It smells very feminine and lovely.</li>
      <li>I bought this because I wanted a new fragrance and this one had good reviews and was really inexpensive.  </li>
      <li>It has a beautiful scent that many mistake for a much more expensive perfume.</li>
      <li>so I mostly use the classic scents.</li>
      <li>CAME QUICKLY AND</li>
      <li>The box and bottle are really pretty too.</li>
      <li>This was my first blind-purchase perfume buy</li>
      <li>It can be found at TJ Maxx and Ross, where I first discovered them.</li>
      <li>recommend the pink one as well, the Rose I believe.</li>
      <li>An hour later it smells lovely, feminine, and soft, more of a white scent than anything else.</li>
      <li>It does smell &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; though like fresh cut flowers but more like the green parts than the flower part, if that makes sense.  </li>
      <li>if you are out for a day, it will last long enough for you to have a continuous good scent wherever you go</li>
      <li>Have checked many other sights and this one, by far, is the cheapest.  </li>
      <li>but its a very nice casual scent and</li>
      <li>THIS IS A LONG LASTING AND STRONG FRAGANCE.</li>
      <li>Recommended for anyone who&#x27;d like a unique and striking casual perfume and are willing to wait a few minutes for it to settle, then Cabotine is for you.</li>
      <li>I use to work at a major department store</li>
      <li>and it calms down well with a very unusual and yet feminine ginger/floral scent.</li>

<li> I&#x27;ve heard it described as a green scent-</li>
<li> but it is definitely not my favorite.  </li>
<li> Its quite awful really, all ginger and chemicals.</li>
<li> (Sorry, but whatevs).</li>
<li> The price is unbeatable, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s a floral, minty kind of smell that yes may works better with some people.&lt;br /&gt;People always compliment it and love it!&lt;br /&gt;And the guys love it. It smells great even when it wears off a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend the pink one as well, the Rose I believe. I look forward to trying the others by Cabotine.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cheap but great. It can be found at TJ Maxx and Ross, where I first discovered them.</li>
    <li> This scent is tricky. I&#x27;ve heard it described as a green scent- but when I first sprayed it I immediately associated it with Givenchy&#x27;s Ysatis, which strikes me as much more of a yellowy-amber scent. The initial spray is overpowering and chemically. Its quite awful really, all ginger and chemicals. Yuck. Wait a few minutes though and it calms down well with a very unusual and yet feminine ginger/floral scent. An hour later it smells lovely, feminine, and soft, more of a white scent than anything else. It doesnt last TOO long, maybe 5-6 hours but its a very nice casual scent and unlike anything I&#x27;ve ever smelled before. Recommended for anyone who&#x27;d like a unique and striking casual perfume and are willing to wait a few minutes for it to settle, then Cabotine is for you.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is so clean and light.  Have constantly gotten complements on the scent.  Best price is on Amazon.  Have checked many other sights and this one, by far, is the cheapest.  Try it, you&#x27;ll really love it.</li>
    <li> I buy 5 bottles of this stuff a year for my wife- she&#x27;s French and has worn it since she was a kid. It&#x27;s the only perfume she&#x27;s ever used,no matter what else comes along, so it must be good!</li>
    <li> I gave this perfume to my daughter who has been wearing it for years. Cabotine has a very fresh, yet sophisticated, long-lasting  scent that has  become her signature fragrance.</li>
    <li> This was my first blind-purchase perfume buy so I was a little nervous on if I would like it or not. It arrived on time, nicely packaged, un-opened and I absolutley LOVE the scent! It smells very feminine and lovely.The price is unbeatable, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>

    <li> I am very satisfied with this product. Everything about it seems fair and honest: the price, the quality and the service.</li>
    <li> I bought this product as a gift, actually it was my girlfriend who bought this as a gift for one of her family members.  It arrived in a timely fashion and unopened, so it arrived in the condition it was advertised in.  My girlfriend is happy with the product and I would buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> As a man I find this irresistible on my wife.</li>
    <li> I got this from my sister in law. Frankly, the only gift that wasn&#x27;t crappy. (Sorry, but whatevs). It has a beautiful scent that many mistake for a much more expensive perfume.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A LONG LASTING AND STRONG FRAGANCE. CAME QUICKLY AND EXCELLENT PRICE.&lt;br /&gt;IT IS A FLORAL SCENT, AND AS WITH PERFUME, DEPENDS ON THE PERSON.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my mom. She loves this one and been using it for years. Excellent price and great service.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s somewhat strong&lt;br /&gt;however if you are out for a day, it will last long enough for you to have a continuous good scent wherever you go</li>
    <li> This in one of my favourites. I use to work at a major department store so I mostly use the classic scents.</li>
    <li> Awesome price love the scent</li>
