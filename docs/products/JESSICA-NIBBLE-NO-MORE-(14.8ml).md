<li> but it was minimal.</li>
<li> This product uses cactus extract for an extremely bitter taste.</li>
<li> There is not much sheen either...good for boys or men.  </li>

<li> There ar some other products simliiar that work just as well.</li>
<li> other reviews were correct about the solution going onto the food when eating.</li>
<li> My son bit his nails for 6 months, I bought other nail stuff and nothing worked.  </li>
<li> Cinnamon toothpaste would be helpful too.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve lost 3 lbs from less snack grazing.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Just received it on recommendation from orthodontist to stop thumb sucking for my 9 yr old.  This stuff is VILE! Its smells like acetone. I was a bit concerned about using it with my kiddo, so applied it to may hands too.  The acetone smell evaporates once it is on, but the taste is hideous. After getting over the initial concern that I was poisoning us, i did find it to be good deterrent. My son is realizing beyond thumb sucking, how much he puts his hands in his mouth too.  Maybe this will improve hygiene.</li>
    <li> I stopped biting my nails in two weeks.</li>
    <li> This is similar to something I used years ago n worked well. I hoping this will to. Tastes as bad as the other one so should work</li>
    <li> I have bitten my nails since I was so young I cant remember. I am now 27 and have tried EVERYTHING. This stuff is disgusting but it works. I love that it dissolves into your nails so you cant remove it, it doesnt come off for a whole day. Be careful and let it dry before eating or you will get it in your mouth. I have been using it a month and my nails are the longest and prettiest they have EVER been. I wouldnt recommend for children because it is such a horrible taste but for adult nail biters, out of all the things i have used this is the ONLY one that worked!</li>
    <li> There ar some other products simliiar that work just as well. Stops the kids from biting for a while until it wears off. Just reapply!</li>
    <li> My dog licked his front paws raw. This product is awesome.  Applied 3 times a day.  Vet keep giving me antibiotics didn&#x27;t work.  He called it OCD.  It is truly a miracle.</li>
    <li> Tastes horrible - which is great&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t look like a clear coat of nail polish - completely disappears on the nail&lt;br /&gt;No build up on the nail that peels off which happens with some similar products&lt;br /&gt;Drys almost instantly&lt;br /&gt;With some competitors products I&#x27;ve noticed that mid-way through the bottle the polish gets thick and unusable - this does not occur&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is priced about mid-range and it is the best I&#x27;ve tried</li>
    <li> fantastic! it did the job. my daughter sucked her thumb constantly, all day long. She is 7 and couldn&#x27;t, wouldn&#x27;t quit!&lt;br /&gt;This aid was the tool she needed to stop the habit.&lt;br /&gt;My son who is 4 refuses to put the solution his thumb. He&#x27;s trying to use sheer will to stop, but isn&#x27;t having the success of my daughter. I will use Jessica No More when he&#x27;s ready.&lt;br /&gt;The other reviews were correct about the solution going onto the food when eating. i kept finger foods off the menu for a bit.</li>
    <li> What I figured out of this watery concoction of doom:&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Effective because it tastes horrible. I mean like rip you tongue out horrible. It lingers like a bitter taunting nightmare in the back of your throat unless you take measures to remove it. Like brush your tongue till its raw kind of deal. Tongue scrapper should be bought since that helps. Cinnamon toothpaste would be helpful too.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve lost 3 lbs from less snack grazing. The comfort eating of sweets especially is lessened from the grossness of licking my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;Beverages like eggnog, hot cocoa or strong coffee will mask it and lessen the sting.&lt;br /&gt;To avoid creating a horrid kissing experience I stopped touching my face as much. Plus is clearer complexion.&lt;br /&gt;I have nails for the first time in years hmm since before my kids were born. In time for family holidays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The instructions are overkill for fine taste buds. I mean if you want agonizing torture instead of a mild bitter reminder go ahead and apply on the whole nail everyday. I just apply once every 3 days to the very edge of the nail and where I see hangnails might form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do NOT shower soon after applying. It goes EVERYWHERE. Forget kisses or other mouth required activities when that happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avoid making any food item within hours of applying or you will taint your precious sustenance. Ruined my family&#x27;s lunch the first day. Had to give them my cookie stash to compensate the horror I unleashed on their unsuspecting tongues. If you must touch food wash your hands 2-3 times first under hot water with dish soap to prevent contamination.&lt;br /&gt;Dental flossing was a terrible, terrible idea till I realized floss picks were a better choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final say:&lt;br /&gt;So get floss picks, tongue scraper, cinnamon or some other nice sharp tasting toothpaste for removal of fresh bitter.&lt;br /&gt;For mild bitter lingering use above mentioned beverages.&lt;br /&gt;Also quick removal of bitter from tongue willprevent becoming accustomed to the torture.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this for 8+ but not so much for younger kids since they put their hands everywhere and forget rather quickly that their fingers are torture devices.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast and I haven&#x27;t bit my nails since starting applying the product. My nails actually look decent for the first time.</li>
    <li> After almost a month using this product it hasn&#x27;t slowed my 3.5 yr old from biting her nails. After application, I use a fan to dry the polish, but it gets on everything. She gets it on her lips and I end up tasting it. YUK. If it worked I would have gave better ratings but need to find a new product that tastes even worse. Uuuggghhh.</li>
    <li> This product uses cactus extract for an extremely bitter taste. One nibble and you&#x27;ll remember it for quite awhile. The best product I&#x27;ve found to remind me to keep my fingers out of my mouth.</li>
    <li> This stuff tastes disgusting and will deter nail biters.  There is not much sheen either...good for boys or men.  Beware of eating  finger foods while using this stuff.</li>
    <li> work for a while then my child got custon to the taste</li>
    <li> My son bit his nails for 6 months, I bought other nail stuff and nothing worked.  This worked within 2 weeks.... worst taste ever.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my 7 year old on biting his nails.</li>
    <li> This really works! I bought to execute my new year&#x27;s resolution to have better nails/quit biting them. The taste is horrendous and is a quick fix. I would recommend painting it on before bed as it lasts for a while, even after multiple hand washes. Sometimes the taste transferred onto food, which was annoying but it was minimal.</li>
    <li> need to put it everyday And i keep forgetting but as long as i do it the product does its Job</li>
    <li> I looked at all of the chemicals and decided not to give it to my kid because alot of the ingredients appeared to be harmful.</li>
    <li> Works great, just don&#x27;t eat with your hands!</li>
    <li> This really does taste awful. And doesn&#x27;t wash off. Perfect!</li>
    <li> Worked exactly as it was supposed to.  Tastes terrible.</li>
