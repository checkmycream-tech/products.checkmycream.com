<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I need much stronger that natural stuff to help my puff or dark circle.</li>
    <li> Love this eye cream . I am happy with this . over all very good !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other eye creams/gels from other high end manufacturers that did nothing to help me whatsoever and were also full of concerning ingredients and synthetic fragrance that would irritate my eyes. This eye gel is loaded with nourishing ingredients, is made with Natural &amp; organic Ingredients. There are no synthetic fragrances at all. So far, I am really liking this gel. I use this mainly at night and wake up to less puffy eyes. It&#x27;s also helping with the little wrinkles I developed. I wake to a dewy complexion that looks better than it did before. It&#x27;s no problem to apply makeup or tinted moisturizer over this product. I&#x27;ve also used a touch of it during the day. There is no &amp;#34;rolling&amp;#34; or product build up that might affect make up application. I’m glad I took a chance and purchased. Great price too! Good Luck with your Purchase!</li>
    <li> Creamy and goes on smooth. It does not take much to apply around the eye area also.I&#x27;m loving the results !!</li>
    <li> Radaincee eye gel cools my skin and leaves it feeling super smooth. Working over 12+ hour shifts, I gotdark circles under my eyes which this cream has been fixing little by little and day by day. Now I use it every day. Very effective eye gel for dark circles</li>
    <li> I am pretty satisfied and will buy this again. I have used it both at night and in the day time under makeup. It works really well to reduce bags under eyes .</li>
    <li> I am so happy using this eye gel because I can tell my eyes look and feel better and it&#x27;s definitely helping me improve my under eye wrinkles and prevent future ones!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a mid 40s professional putting long hours and work stress than is good for me. Needless to say, when I&#x27;m tired it shows on my face, especially my eyes. This eye cream goes on easily, it&#x27;s not greasy and absorbs quickly without stinging. Key with this one is to apply morning and evening twice.My husband noticed a difference and is actually using this product too!</li>
    <li> 5 stars for an excellent item! Its a clear, great smelling Eye Cream! I put it on after showering and you could instantly feel it working even on freshly bathed skin! It is a smaller bottle so you use only a little bit and it goes a long way!! Put it on with your fingers or whatever you feel is safer (q-tip, etc). I used a circular motion when applying it to my eye zone and near my smile wrinkles.So far seems to be working as anti wrinkle cream.  Highly Recommend for anyone needing that extra help!</li>
    <li> So refreshing! I love a an eye cream that has a gel like feel and is cooling and refreshing and this one is all that! I love the feel, I almost feel like my under eyes are tightened in a good feeling way. Very cooling which is super nice esp with hot weather coming up. My makeup goes on just fine over it which is a plus. It&#x27;s moisturizing but not so much where your cant easily use it under makeup with out a big ol mess. I am very pleased with the feel and outcome so far, loving it!</li>
    <li> I would recommend to anyone. It is a good value and works vey good .</li>
    <li> Ridiculously good product. Feels so good :D</li>
    <li> Very please with the product, the price and how much you get in the bottle. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Only used it 2 weeks but feel it is going to work</li>
    <li> OK so first I&#x27;m gonna start by saying this cream was shipped so quickly and the company that makes it emailed me full detailed instructions. Now when it comes to consistency, I love it. Its very light weight and does not drag the skin around ur eyes and absorbs very well. And when it comes down to effectiveness I would say it has worked pretty well for me. I&#x27;m 24 but I have dark under eye circles and slight bags that make me look much older but I see a big difference in the darkness and I also feel like the skin is more supple around my eyes. I want to use this product longer and see how much more it can do for me. But when it finishes I&#x27;m definitely buying more.This is definitelt the best eye cream that I have used. Oh and I almost forget to mention that it comes in a very convenient pump that let&#x27;s u use only as much as ur comfortable with. Thanks for making this wonderful product!</li>
    <li> I love this cream. It has a fresh light scent. Goes on smooth. I noticed a difference immediately. Love it. Thank you for a great product!</li>
    <li> I feel light discomfort on the skin , maybe cream will better then gel for me .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with that. .I&#x27;ll definitely continue to use this .This is the First eye cream I have used that actually works.</li>
    <li> I used it daily for a good week straight. I was noticing some dryness under my eyes.</li>
    <li> It works just as well .It&#x27;s great to find a product that has natural products and essential oils. I would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> So far so good !! I am happy with this eye gel .</li>
    <li> I like this gel. Usually use creams because the gels dry hard but not this one &amp; it totally got rid of my puffiness.</li>
    <li> I have been using this eye gel for 3 weeks and I love it. It took couple of weeks for me to see results. It definitely helps reduce puffiness and dark under the eyes and also wrinkles.It does not irritate my eyes like so many other eye creams. I did not even need to use mositurizer after applying this. Definitely looking younger now  -:) !!!</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product a little over a week but so far results have been good. The eye gel has a firming effect on the eyes and forehead. I will probably know much better at the end of month but the start seems to be good so far</li>
    <li> When I started using the product a few weeks ago, my eyes were sore and puffy. I was using a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; eye cream day and night, but that didn&#x27;t seem to help. Since using this my eyes feel better, are no longer puffy and the dark circles have diminished. I am in my late 30&#x27;s and after using this some of the age spots are lighter too.</li>
    <li> Amazing Product! Puffiness is gone</li>
    <li> Its been almost a week I&#x27;m using the Anti aging soothing brightening cucumber eye by Randiancee, and I want to bring out the great transformation I observed for my dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;I have really dark under eye circles that is hereditary and has been a part of me since long. I bought this creme because its Organic &amp; Natural products and wanted to try it, I&#x27;m so happy that I made this choice as I saw results instantly  !!!&lt;br /&gt;It has made the under eye area more smoother and lighter by using it twice a day morning after shower before makeup and night after removing makeup.&lt;br /&gt;It feels nice and has cooling effect on skin and also hydrates really well.&lt;br /&gt;Even applied on my chin with flaky skin and overnite it was treated to a supple skin texture.&lt;br /&gt;Its a great buy for my skincare routine and I would also give a follow up review.Try it and feel the difference for yourself :) I&#x27;m sure you will love it !!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work. Maybe slight difference on wrinkles, but nothing on the bags.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with that. .I&#x27;ll definitely continue to use this .This is the First eye cream I have used that actually works.</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite eye cream.&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff. It has considerably reduced my under eye wrinkles. I also use it on my eyelids to tighten that area. Since using this I have honestly never been happier with any anti-aging under eye product.&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is by far the best eye gel I have ever used. I’ve used this bottle every day twice for few weeks and it&#x27;s still going strong! Well worth the money to me!&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Erases under eye wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;-Can be used all over your face. I use under eye, eyelid, forehead, on my neck to prevent wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;-Without any harmful chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;-The bottle is extremely easy to use with a pump that dispenses the perfect amount.&lt;br /&gt;-Does cause tightens around the eyes but that’s what is making the wrinkles go away.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mother who is in her mid 50s. This gel isn&#x27;t too thin or too thick. It takes couple of minutes for the gel to soak in and dry. You actually can tell a difference with using the anti wrinkle eye cream. Wrinkles seem to be filled in and smoothed out. You can also feel a difference because the skin feels much smoother than that around it.</li>
    <li> I have been so impressed with this eye gel, that I have already reordered. I like the look, smell and feel of it even better than the Christian Dior Capture products I have been using for more than 20 years, and Radiancee Eye Gel saves me 80 percent compared to the cost of the Dior products. This comes in great packaging too. It&#x27;s about time disruption is coming to the snooty, overpriced cosmetics industry!</li>
    <li> I am very picky about what products I use. I was happy to try this one as it contains natural and organic ingredients such as plant stem cells and contains no parabens, sulfates or alcohol.I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Very good gel Love it works perfectly on dark circles I would love to use it longer to se if it works on my crowfeet and yes I do recomend this gel to anyone.Overall, I had a nice experience with the eye gel.</li>
    <li> I have bought so many eye creams to try and decrease eye puffiness , firming and an overall tired look. This by far makes the most difference. I&#x27;m 37 and a mom of three under 10. I&#x27;ve spent hundreds trying to fix eye troubles and now aging eyes. Within a week I saw a difference. I just happened to try this because I am a frequent Amazon customer and searched eye creams and the eye gel came up. Really worth the money and best anti aging eye cream. I&#x27;ve spent hundreds on creams that don&#x27;t make a difference like this one. I also have sensitive skin and after three weeks have great improvements in overall look! So worth the money and so satisfied with this product...</li>
    <li> I am in my twenties and have developed puffy bags under my eyes. After lengthy research on the best product for this and checking out the ingredients I tried this. I used it for few weeks on and off and now my bags under my eyes have almost diminished. Excited to see what a few weeks will bring! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I was actually surprised that this eye gel does what it claims. I&#x27;ve had a problem with puffiness and dark circles under my eyes for many years now. To the point that people asking me, why I looked so tired all the time on my no makeup days. So when I gave this a try I was skeptical, but willing to see if anything would help. TRY IT! While it doesn&#x27;t take all of the puffiness away it significantly reduced the dark circles ?? I also put it on my forehead and it has softened the worry lines and on my upper cheeks where I have severe redness and it has brightened that up as well. Just for those reasons alone I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I have been struggling with puffy eyes for as long as I can remember. I have done the frozen spoon trick and everything to no avail. Imagine my complete SURPRISE when this product ACTUALLY worked! I couldn&#x27;t believe that I didn&#x27;t look swollen around my eyes! This product has a great cucumber smell . I use this product in the mornings and evenings before bed. I saw definite results after only a week of disciplined use!!&lt;br /&gt;Blessings!!</li>
    <li> After turning 30 and having 2 kids back to back, the skin under my eyes wasn&#x27;t what it used to be when I was 18. I began to get a large crease and it would show up in pictures. I decided to try this out after reading reviews , ingredients and 1 year guarantee. So far I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month. After the first week or two I began to see great results. I didn&#x27;t really have very deep &amp;#34;dark under eye circles&amp;#34; but my skin began to brighten up, my crease minimized and it just overall improved my appearance. My husband even complemented on the look.  Absolutely loved it.</li>
    <li> I highly recomend this product .Still a big fan of the brand.</li>
    <li> Works well at night and under my eye make up during the day. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I use it on my eyez. Its an awesome product .I bought this product for my eyes dark circles, only few days from first day so far so good</li>
    <li> I am picky about what I put on my skin as most anti-aging products have too many chemicals that actually age your skin. It is a fact that your body makes collagen to keep skin tight, so using the right diet along with natural and healthy ingredients on your skin like Aloe Vera, Cucumber and Hyaluronic Acid stimulates your body to make its own collagen. This is the product to help your body do that. I would recommend it as part of a daily anti-aging under eye regimen.</li>
    <li> Seems good, I just need to get better at not getting my fat fingers into my eyes.</li>
    <li> Great product, was surprise how great it tighten up around the eyes. Made me feel wide awake! The product smell great, it was a nice smooth product, I def recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for three weeks and see absolutely no difference.</li>
    <li> I have used so many products before and nothing worked so I almost passed this up. So glad that I decided to try this one. This SHOWED REAL results within first week. I now see significant improvement for dark undereye circles and puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is now part of my daily cleansing routine.</li>
    <li> Absolute refreshing experience after 2 days of applying.&lt;br /&gt;I am not a person into these kind of things but after learning about this product and knowing its made in USA with all natural ingredients, I ordered it. After using for only 2 days at night after my hectic day and I felt it very refreshing and soothing. I would definitely recommend this and personally continue to use this.</li>
    <li> Having never used such products before, i was a little apprehensive but after doing some research and the fact that this was described as made from organic and natural ingredients, I ordered a couple of bottles.&lt;br /&gt;The products arrived promptly as ordered and packaged well.&lt;br /&gt;Started using it and i must say that it looks really promising. It has been a little less than 10 days of using this and i see clear difference in the puffiness of the eyes. It is vastly reduced. The gel is cool on application (am assuming that is the effect of cucumber) and you can feel the gentle tightness around your eyes few minutes after you apply. It has a nice fragrance too - a very subtle hint of rose, but am not sure if rose water is used in the preparation or my nose is getting tricked. It is not sticky at all and all but disappears in some minutes after application. Intend to post a more detailed review after few more days of application as the wrinkles and crow feets would naturally take a bit longer to show any difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that it is made in US definitely helped with the decision to try it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how this thing got 5 star review. I waited to finish whole bottle before posting the review because I wanted to see the results. Bottle is now done and absolutely no results at all, not even slightly, leaves the skin smooth after applying it but any other lotion can pro do that. Did not see any results to what it says it supposed to do.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;This is an amazing product. Very effective, could see the difference in less than a week. feels comfortable and natural with no side effects. First such product in the market that I could find at a great price. Highly recommended. Will buy again.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This product leaves my skin feeling smoother, and more firm. More replenished and healthier looking in general.It does come in a nice pump container also, always handy. The product feels lightweight which I enjoy over a heavy weighted down feeling.I would suggest using this twice a day but definitely  before bed, seems best to do then.</li>
    <li> As I age,it seems that the circles under my eyes get darker. I have tried so many things over the years,and some work, some not so good. When I tried this eye cream , at first glance I really like the consistency of it. I can see small real changes within first week itself. As I use this every day , there is a noticeable difference in my dark circles.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I am not getting enough sleep, or if it is stress or what. My eyes always look tired.If you are like me, you are also tired of your eyes always looking tired.&lt;br /&gt;I received this Eye Gel  in exchange for my review and honest opinion. The eye gel is very easy to use. You just dab a small amount around your eyes twice a day. I apply it in the morning before I put my makeup on and again before I go to bed.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the gel for about a week now. In that time, I can see pretty noticeable difference. I never knew that changing the appearance of something so small as your eyes, can change your whole appearance. I have already received compliments on my skin, and all I did what add a little gel to my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;The dark circles and bags under my eyes are already lighter in just over a week</li>
    <li> I have used so many skin products it’s insane. And I have to say for the effective value, this one might be the champion. It has a great quality cucumber cream and it feels great on the eyes, and most of all the results speak for themselves. I have periodic swelling around my face that makes me look puffy but after applying this product it goes down quite a bit. I enjoy feeling like I have something like this in my back pocket in case some stuff goes down on my face.</li>
    <li> This Eye Gel is on the thicker side and feels so smooth going on. Overall works very good !</li>
    <li> I love this product! It smells exactly like cucumbers. After using this my skin feels very hydrated. The gel has a slight cooling sensation. It makes your skin feel awake and refreshed. Few of my favorite ingredients are Hyaluronic acid &amp; VITAMIN E. Vitamin E is an antioxidant that protects and repairs your skin. It has a very beneficial effect in helping prevent the signs of premature aging. Hyaluronic Acid helps to produce collage which reverses the signs of aging. I mentioned some of the wonderful ingredients that I love in this product. The gel is also 100% natural with organic ingredients. This product does not contain parabens, sulfates or alcohol. I really love using this eye gel every day. I have seen my wrinkles and under eye dark circles reduce. If you love eye gels, I guarantee you will fall in love with this one!</li>
    <li> I bought this anti wrinkle cream after I read the reviewss. I have used many products costing hundreds of dollars that never worked. I honestly want to say this product is the best eye gel. I have been using this product for a couple of weeks twice a day and I can already see improvements. My dark circles are disappearing, the puffiness is less and my wrinkles are less visible. i would definately buy it again.</li>
    <li> I use it all the time. No problem yet . I am so happy with this . Overall Very good !</li>
    <li> I am completely happy with this product .I have definitely seen it improve my puffy, morning eyes. It is lightweight and absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> This Radiancee Eye Gel has a nice light cucumber scent. The gel is cooling as it touches your skin. I LOVE it under my eyes and along my eyebrows and in between my eyes. It gives a very soothing and moisturizing effect. After using it for more than 3 weeks now I can definitely feel the difference in under eye skin which is more tight and light. Diminished Dark circles &amp; Eye wrinkles. I even use it under my makeup. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> if you ever asked , &amp;#34;what is the best wrinkle cream&amp;#34; ? , I will say try radiancee. I am in love since I tried this Eye Gel. fell in love with it the first time I used it. I&#x27;ve been sooooo busy lately and not getting near enough sleep so am tired all the time and it shows. :-( But, after using this eye gel, I saw dramatic results in a week! My wrinkles are much more smoother by second week. Skin is firmer and My bags under my eyes were almost gone...! The dark circles were significantly reduced and the area under my eyes looked much more youthful and taught. wrinkles are much more smoother already. I will definitely make sure I reorder this before I run out. I carry it with me everywhere! Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I just started on my third week and third bottle and the bags and wrinkles are still quite visible but I believe are shrinking somewhat. It sure  feels like I&#x27;m doing some good for my appearance and wish I would have taken a picture before I started using it. I think the shadows have become less dark and I&#x27;m going to continue with it through this third bottle.</li>
    <li> It seems to take the puff down for hours.</li>
    <li> Nice cool feeling when first applied.  Great moisturizer!  Leaves skin around eyes feeling smooth.</li>
    <li> I have been Working really hard over last few months and got nasty  dark circles and bags under my eyes. Every morning I started feeling  puffy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream is fixing it little by little every day. This started showing noticeable result with in one week, Key was to use it every day. it also leaves my skin feeling super smooth &amp;cool feel around the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying multiple products ,I think this is one of the best cream I have ever used that works this great. It smell great and refreshes too.  Absolutely love it and now a fan for lifetime..</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about one month now and it is really working on me. My puffiness under my eyes is almost gone. First day , I thought that this is a little strong but than it felt very natural. I did start to see some improvement with in first week.</li>
    <li> I have puffy eyes due to daily stress and no sleep. Tried a few premium products however this seems to be the best eye cream for puffy eyes.  I love it that it has Cucumber as an ingredient - This beats putting cucumbers on my eyes every morning and laying down.I really think that this eye cream will be able to treat eye bags and puffy eyes for most of the people. I will continue using this.</li>
    <li> People at work have noticed a new glow about me. I tell them I use this cucumber eye cream and that I use it nightly every single day. I think it&#x27;s cool that it exists--the cream reduces the lines around your eyes and makes me feel great every morning.</li>
    <li> Had wrinkles and lines below my eyes. After couple of weeks , it started working on them and I started seeing the difference. Never using anything else. Very happy with this product</li>
    <li> No, you don&#x27;t look over 40. &amp;#34;Maybe about 32.&amp;#34; Thanks lady at the corner. She mentioned the eyes and the youthful look and I really think it&#x27;s because of this cream. I put it on every night to prevent any wrinkles and bags and so far, so good. Feeling great with a bounce in my step. Keep the compliments coming, world.</li>
    <li> I was developing spots around my eyes because of age or whatever, and I started to use this product. It worked surprisingly well and the spots have practically disappeared. Amazing.</li>
    <li> Bought it because of the good reviews and reasonable price. Been using it 1-2 times daily for about a month now and have noticed that the skin under my eyes is smoother, lighter and tighter. My dark circles weren&#x27;t terrible, but I used to use concealer everyday. Now I don&#x27;t have to. I&#x27;m 30 years old and don&#x27;t want to look any more older than that. Will definitely buy it again as this product seems to do the trick.</li>
