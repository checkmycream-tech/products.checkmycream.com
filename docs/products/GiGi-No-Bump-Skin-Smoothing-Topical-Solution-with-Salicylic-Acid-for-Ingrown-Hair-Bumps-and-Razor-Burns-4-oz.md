      <li>Gonna get more right now!  </li>
      <li>This product should only be used as a way to prevent razor burn and is best used right after shaving.</li>
      <li>It smells like pure alcohol and I suspect that I may have been duped!!!  }:</li>
      <li>but it definitely takes care of any ingrowns and works great to prevent them.</li>
      <li>Together with a light home dermabrasion</li>
      <li>After using over a period of about a year I&#x27;ve also noticed that scarring and discoloration has been significantly reduced to almost nothing.</li>
      <li>My best friend got married last year and decided to have her first bikini wax.</li>
      <li>Waited a couple of hours, took a bath to clean up the wax residue and applied the no bump stuff.  </li>
      <li>The smell is strong, at first, but quickly fades.  </li>
      <li>I use it once a day mainly after I get out of the shower, sometimes more here and there</li>
      <li>Used this product for years - none better - very sensitive skin and have never had a problem.</li>
      <li>A good price for this product and works just as great as other more expensive brands :)</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re considering this product it is worth a shot.</li>
      <li>And the trade off of no bumps is soo worth it.</li>
      <li>so I think it&#x27;s definitely worth a try</li>
      <li>or you might be missing out on something amazing!</li>
      <li>Poured some into a travel bottle this time and hope it makes it safely there and back.</li>
      <li>And the next morning, it continued to get better.</li>
      <li>I really hope they keep making this (so that I can keep buying it)!</li>
      <li>Got my first Brazilian wax today and as the salon that I went to didn&#x27;t have any after care products,  </li>
      <li>Works very well under the chin and ok on back of my neck from shaving.</li>
      <li>Is pretty much rubbing alcohol and burns....</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had mild acne for a long time and this is the only thing that really knocks it right on the head and gets rid of the constant bumpiness for good.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s the real thing and give it another try.</li>
      <li>My whole life I&#x27;ve had a problem with razor burn (?)</li>
      <li>With routine use after each shave, this producted worked very well in reducing the irritation and occurance of razor bump (also know as Pseudofolliculitis).  </li>
      <li>I went straight to Sally&#x27;s and got the Gigi No Bump.  </li>
      <li>This really does help to prevent shaving bumps.</li>
      <li>Got this for my guy and it really works well.</li>
      <li>This product works very well.  </li>
      <li>The high alcohol content also makes it smell awful.&lt;br /&gt;You would be better off using Witch Hazel and organic Aloe Vera gel, all natural, does the same thing and at the fraction of the price.</li>
      <li>Its pretty cheap, and the pain is minimal pain.</li>
      <li>then I highly suggest you get it from Sally beauty supply (online or in store)</li>
      <li>I went some place new and they used this on me.</li>
      <li>I asked to return and get a new one</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin, so it&#x27;s kind of hard not to get them.</li>
      <li>It is particularly a problem among individuals with very curly or coarse hair.</li>
      <li>You do have to pretty much use it daily though or the bumps will come back.</li>
      <li>My skin isn&#x27;t even sensitive...</li>
      <li>Use it daily and it should heal bumps you have and prevent new ones from forming.</li>
      <li>It stings a little on freshly shaved skin but it does the trick.</li>
      <li>The next day, the bumps were almost completely gone.</li>
      <li>OH MY GOODNESS not a single bump!</li>
      <li>Seriously - my whole life I&#x27;ve had to carefully plan when I shave my armpits, because I could only do it about once every 4-5 days.</li>
      <li>I tried it out on my bikibi area first since a had a few places that were bothering me.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> When it arrived 1/4 of the product had already spill. I asked to return and get a new one but I got stuck will all the lame customer service bs....</li>
    <li> produce wasn&#x27;t properly sealed</li>
    <li> Got this for my guy and it really works well. His face looks much better</li>
    <li> I get really bad ingrown hair on my face when I shave, especially in my neck and chin area.  I switched razors, tried different shaving creams, and have used tons of different after shaves but nothing worked. I finally gave this stuff a try and I&#x27;m impressed. I have defiantly noticed fewer and fewer ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> Everyones skin is different so one product won&#x27;t work on everyone. With that being said, this stuff is made for my skin. My whole life I&#x27;ve had a problem with razor burn (?) bumps in my underarms after I shave. Seriously - my whole life I&#x27;ve had to carefully plan when I shave my armpits, because I could only do it about once every 4-5 days. Day 1: clean, smooth skin, Day 2-4: so many bumps!! Uncomfortable and EMBARRASSING! This stuff has solved that. I have had minimal bumps, only 1 or 2 (sometimes 0!), not 10 or 20 like before. I use it once a day mainly after I get out of the shower, sometimes more here and there when I think about it. It does smell a bit like rubbing alcohol and has a bit of a burn, but nothing unbearable. Its pretty cheap, and the pain is minimal pain. If you&#x27;re considering this product it is worth a shot.</li>
    <li> This has been working amazingly.  Its much cheaper than the alternative, but I&#x27;m happy to say...no bumps on my bikini line!  The smell is strong, at first, but quickly fades.  And the trade off of no bumps is soo worth it.</li>
    <li> great for eliminating bumps.</li>
    <li> Awesome!!!&lt;br /&gt;Does the job&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using a more expencive product and there is no difference with this one......&lt;br /&gt;Will use it again</li>
    <li> Great stuff to use after shaving or waxing any part of the body. Excellent for preventing  ingrowm hairs ,redness,bumps or any irritation.I have used it for years.</li>
    <li> I use this for my bikini area and bum. Best stuff ever! There is also a roll on for this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a recommendation from a YouTuber saying it helps with razor burn. I have used it many times and didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference. It stings horribly, without much benefit. It also has a warning that there is an ingredient known to cause birth defects which is no go for me. After just accepting that razor burn on my bikini line is just a fact of life, I read that using Cetaphil face wash is a God sent trick and OH MY GOODNESS not a single bump! I am so glad I heard about it!</li>
    <li> Works very well under the chin and ok on back of my neck from shaving. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product is great. It burns a little when you apply it but it definitely takes care of any ingrowns and works great to prevent them. I don&#x27;t go a day without it now.</li>
    <li> this stuff works great on psoriasis to lessen the scales</li>
    <li> I have been desperate to find something to help get rid of razor burn and ingrown hairs (ewww!), but this just didn&#x27;t do it for me! I thought the stinging would mean it was doing something...but nope. Just stinging and no results.</li>
    <li> I usually buy this at Sally&#x27;s, but its easier for me to buy online. The shipping was somewhat slow, but reasonable. But the product, is my fave. My best friend got married last year and decided to have her first bikini wax. Of course she was suckered into buying they&#x27;re bikini wax relief creams for over $30. The day before her wedding, it irritated her so bad it became embarrassing and crucial to figure something out. I went out, drove to Sally&#x27;s and bought this for her. The next day, the bumps were almost completely gone. I swear by this product. I use this after shaving or waxing every time. This stuff is AMAZING!</li>
    <li> This product works very well.  Within 12 hours of use, any red shave bumps I have are gone.  I will definitely keep buying this product</li>
    <li> I guess it did a great job .. because I brought it for my daughter and she hasn&#x27;t complain that it did work for her</li>
    <li> My sister warned me it burns a bit but I didn&#x27;t get any burning sensation. Did a great job at keeping me from getting in grown hairs after waxing.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re itching and bumpy from razor burn, you need this! It stings a little on freshly shaved skin but it does the trick.</li>
    <li> Really prevents bump forming, it has a good scent and is easy to apply... Love that I&#x27;m not getting Bumps after waxing</li>
    <li> Amazing product, and  this is a really great price for it. Use it daily and it should heal bumps you have and prevent new ones from forming. I see some people claim they received a fake, if that&#x27;s true then I highly suggest you get it from Sally beauty supply (online or in store) that way you know for sure it&#x27;s the real thing and give it another try. Everyone is different though, so maybe for some people it just doesn&#x27;t work. For me, this is a miracle product so I think it&#x27;s definitely worth a try or you might be missing out on something amazing! I shave my entire bikini area all year round, Brazilian style, because I&#x27;m too scared to wax and this product is the only thing that let&#x27;s me do that without being covered in hideous bumps and giving away my secret that I shave instead of wax.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 9 years.  It is the only product that actually works to keep razor bumps and irritation away.  I can shave my bikini line every single day, with NO fear of any unsightly irritation or bumps, as long as I apply the No Bump after my shower.  Excellent product, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands/products in the past and this one i just did not care for. its stung a lot more than others i&#x27;ve used and the smell of it was awful. i couldnt use it regularly because of this therefore it did not work that well for me.</li>
    <li> My husband and I both use this for under arms and genital area after shaving. (WDon&#x27;t need for my legs or his face.) Works well. No more ingrowns!  Those complaining about alcohol should know that ingredient an hairs can become infected from soap or other &#x27;stuff&#x27; left on the skin. The alcohol will disinfect the area while pores are still open.</li>
    <li> It gave me more bumps! It was put in the trash! It would have cost me more to return it!</li>
    <li> A good price for this product and works just as great as other more expensive brands :)</li>
    <li> This really does help to prevent shaving bumps. It didn&#x27;t prevent ingrown hairs from waxing, but for regular shaving it does help.</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;no bump&amp;#34; name may imply that it&#x27;s for men&#x27;s razor bumps, but it works for women with ingrown hair issues, too. Together with a light home dermabrasion twice weekly, it has nearly cleared my face of all those ugly little ingrown hair messes. The only drawback is that it smells like a chemistry lab (lots of alcohol).</li>
    <li> Product is not as great as people&#x27;s reviews made it out 2 b.</li>
    <li> With routine use after each shave, this producted worked very well in reducing the irritation and occurance of razor bump (also know as Pseudofolliculitis).  Pseudofolliculitis results from body hairs that become ingrown generally due to shaving. It is particularly a problem among individuals with very curly or coarse hair. The ingrown hairs result in inflamed bumps. I am an African-American male and experience pseudofolliculitis from shaving my face and neck.  This product provided visible results in reducing the occurance of inflamed bumps and/or skin irration in the face and neck  from shaving.</li>
    <li> not no bumps RX work ok don&#x27;t like the smell</li>
    <li> I love Gigi No Bump,you don&#x27;t have to use a lot and it keeps the bumps and ingrown hairs away</li>
    <li> Love how the product works..</li>
    <li> I use it every time I wax my legs or bikini line. No bumps whatsoever. It&#x27;s my third bottle.</li>
    <li> I swear by this product.  As a water aerobics instructor, I am shaving often and since I started using this after shaving I don&#x27;t get those ugly red bumps.</li>
    <li> This is great for before and after waxing and keeps from any ingrown hairs I use this every day! One try and your hooked</li>
    <li> It does the job. I can&#x27;t find it in local stores so glad I can still pick it up online.</li>
    <li> I started getting more bumps using this product.  It smells like pure alcohol and I suspect that I may have been duped!!!  }:</li>
    <li> No bumps or redness.  Works great every time. The bottle leaked when I took it on vacation last year. Poured some into a travel bottle this time and hope it makes it safely there and back.</li>
    <li> This product should only be used as a way to prevent razor burn and is best used right after shaving. Works good at preventing razor burn in bikini area about 80% of the time. I just wish it worked at eliminating them too but doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift and tried it on the spot when my friend was waxing my legs, I am not neurotic, but when I read the back later at home that it contains a chemical which is harmful for babies development I put it down.&lt;br /&gt;From the list of products, as a chemist I can tell you, all they are derived to do is shrink your pores and dry your skin. The high alcohol content also makes it smell awful.&lt;br /&gt;You would be better off using Witch Hazel and organic Aloe Vera gel, all natural, does the same thing and at the fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best and most effective razor bump solution I have ever used.</li>
    <li> stuff always works great.</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  Gonna get more right now!  I advise anyone who&#x27;s having problems with in grown hairs to grab some with me!</li>
    <li> I got this because I kept getting ingrown hairs when I would shave my bikini area. It itched, it was annoying, and I hated it. I have sensitive skin, so it&#x27;s kind of hard not to get them. I even get them on my legs from time to time. I decided to walk into my local Sally Beauty store and see what they had because I tried that Bikini Zone stuff and didn&#x27;t care for it. They recommended this product to me, so I bought it. I tried it out on my bikibi area first since a had a few places that were bothering me. I actually put this on before bed. The next morning, the ingrown hairs and razor bumps were almost completey gone! I applied it again before bed. And the next morning, it continued to get better. Then I decided to try it on my legs since I had some ingrown hairs and razor bumps on the sides of my calves. When I got up the next morning, there was no change. I applied it again on my legs that night, and the next morning, there was still really no change. So for me this worked on my bikini area but not my legs.</li>
    <li> Used this product for years - none better - very sensitive skin and have never had a problem. grat but</li>
    <li> I just wax yesterday and I used little after and I think works. Leave your skin smooth and feels good.</li>
    <li> Best product I&#x27;ve found so far. You do have to pretty much use it daily though or the bumps will come back.</li>
    <li> I literally won&#x27;t use anything else! I&#x27;ve had mild acne for a long time and this is the only thing that really knocks it right on the head and gets rid of the constant bumpiness for good. After using over a period of about a year I&#x27;ve also noticed that scarring and discoloration has been significantly reduced to almost nothing. I really hope they keep making this (so that I can keep buying it)!</li>
    <li> Excellent - been using this for several weeks.  No bumps or spots.  Skin is softer and waxing easier.</li>
    <li> Works well and great price. Husband loves this product.</li>
    <li> LOVE this STUFF!!! When I get my eyebrows waxed they tend to use baby oil which causes me to break out. I went some place new and they used this on me. My daughter suffered the same reaction when she gets her eyebrows waxed. I bought her a bottle to take with her every time she goes and gets her eyebrows waxed. No more breakouts as she has them use this instead of baby oil</li>
    <li> Jesus, Mary and Joseph!!!!  Got my first Brazilian wax today and as the salon that I went to didn&#x27;t have any after care products,  I went straight to Sally&#x27;s and got the Gigi No Bump.  Waited a couple of hours, took a bath to clean up the wax residue and applied the no bump stuff.  Mother of Gawd!  It felt like someone lit a fire on my hoo-ha!!!!  Stings a little my ass!!!!  I thought that I  was scared of the wax itself...that was popcorn compared to the fire that this product caused down yonder.  Did I do something wrong?????</li>
    <li> A must have for shaving-waxing. Definitely works.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work, and smells terrible. There are some questionable medical warnings as well.</li>
    <li> If I could give negative stars I would... Is pretty much rubbing alcohol and burns.... My skin isn&#x27;t even sensitive...</li>
