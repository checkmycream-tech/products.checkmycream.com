      <li>Nothing special about it.</li>
      <li>Really wanted to love this since i use Weleda products on my baby.</li>
      <li>Absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>but it quickly dissipates -</li>
      <li>This lotion is good, it absorbs well, and keeps my very dry skin moisturized.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve paid 5 times as much for a facial lotion and not had this good result.</li>
      <li>I tried a sample of this in a local shop and fell in love with the wild rose smell.  </li>
      <li>I have tried nearly every brand on the market and none have made my skin look and feel better than this one.</li>

      <li>This stuff smells amazing and you only need a pea sized drop to cover your whole face and neck.  </li>
      <li>It works well in your skin, leaving it smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>I received a sample - 7 day supply - and I totally fell in love with the product.</li>
      <li>Chemicals get absorbed through skin and enter the bloodtream and affect the whole body.</li>
      <li>This is one of my holy grail moisturizers, and I just love Weleda overall.</li>
      <li>But that is the exact ingredient that helps with the inflammation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I first received a sample of this moisturizer from Birchbox over a year ago and I haven&#x27;t stopped using it since.</li>
      <li>It feels gentle and soothing as well, and it actually goes into your skin instead of just staying on top of it all shiny.</li>
      <li>to first review:  I couldn&#x27;t find another face lotion I liked better than the Weleda Rose Lotion, so I started using a little distilled water to thin the lotion as I applied it to my face</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>I really wanted to keep using it, however I started breaking out on my face.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I LOVE this cream.  I have been on the hunt for a daily moisturizer that actually makes my skin feel and look beautiful.  This is the winner!  This stuff smells amazing and you only need a pea sized drop to cover your whole face and neck.  The price is reasonable and the tube lasts me about 2 months.  I use the amazon subscibe and save and it gets the price down to about $15/ tube (which is almost $10 cheaper than buying it a Whole foods!)&lt;br /&gt;My face is clearer and more hydrated than it ever has been.  I really wish i had found this a long time ago.</li>
    <li> Smells nice. Not seeing any results and almost gone. Feels nice.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Small tube.  I use as a refresher.</li>
    <li> It is not worth the price. I have normal skin but this product is leaving my skin thirsty. I would not buy it again,hate the smell.</li>
    <li> i recieved this lotion in my birchbox and i LOVE it! i have combination/acne prone skin and this was amazing at night. i also wear it in the daytime, under my sunscreen. my favorite part is the smell!</li>
    <li> I am sort of torn over this product. It is light and soothing on my skin. I get some inflammation and red spots on my face from the sun, and this lotion seems to help that a bit. But I really dislike the scent. There is something very unpleasant about it. All I can think of is maybe it&#x27;s the horsestail extract? That is one herb I&#x27;ve never smelled before, so maybe that is it? I don&#x27;t know. But that is the exact ingredient that helps with the inflammation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I am wishing that Weleda would add more rose scent, and if that is not strong enough, maybe even some other herbal scents like lavender or something to help cover up the non-pleasant smell. Because other than that, it&#x27;s a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I loved using this lotion.  The smell was heavenly and it definitely improved my skin texture.  The only down side of this product is the price.</li>
    <li> I received a sample - 7 day supply - and I totally fell in love with the product. It smell so good. It reminds me of some friends&#x27; rose garden. The perfume is quite strong, but very pleasant. My skin is combination - oily and it is very hard to find a lotion that won&#x27;t make my skin more greasy or won&#x27;t dry it too much. This feels really good on the skin. It absorbs instantly. Won&#x27;t dry my face and I noticed that it is not oily either. You only need a small quantity for each application. I love that it has mostly natural ingredients and it is made in Europe where they are way more cautious about the cosmetics regulations. Yes, they actually put the expiration date on their products. Unbelievable, huh? No more expired products on my face.</li>
    <li> Not moisturizing enough and I don&#x27;t have dry skin.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m enjoying using this lotion. The rose fragrance is pretty--not artificial or overly strong. And I like the texture of the lotion. It&#x27;s spreads easily and absorbs into my skin; it&#x27;s not at all greasy or heavy.</li>
    <li> Works great even jlo uses it!</li>
    <li> Wow, do I feel like an idiot for paying so much for such a tiny amount of a foul-smelling product. I actually love the smell of products containing rose scents, but there is something else in here as well, and it stinks...so much so that my 12-year-old will not hug me when I&#x27;m wearing this. Going in the trash.</li>
    <li> I like the feel of the lotion on my skin and I like the fragrance  To me it had kind of a fresh, healing smell to it.  I really wanted to keep using it, however I started breaking out on my face.  I know it was The Weleda facial lotion because it was the only new product I was using at the time and I don&#x27;t normally have breakouts on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit to first review:  I couldn&#x27;t find another face lotion I liked better than the Weleda Rose Lotion, so I started using a little distilled water to thin the lotion as I applied it to my face and I have had no breakouts on my face.  I use an amber dropper bottle for the water and mix with a small amount of the lotion on my finger tip.</li>
    <li> I like the lotion itself but the smell is a bit heavy.</li>
    <li> i purchase a tube of this facial cream after watching Nicole Sharp on You Tube rave about the company, so I thought I would give it a try. When I first got it was a little disappointed in the amount you got for the price, and at first I didn&#x27;t really like the smell of it. It went on very oily and I thought that&#x27;s it I will not purchase it again!&lt;br /&gt;Well after using it a few times my skin is so smooth and well hydrated that I love it! The cream does penetrate into your skin in a few minutes and just leaves a slightly glowing, smooth feeling all day on your face.&lt;br /&gt;I have just purchase two more of the Iris Facial lotions and cannot wait to try it, my Rose facial lotion is just about gone!&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the only facial lotions that I don&#x27;t mind spending a lttle extra for, it works.</li>
    <li> This is the best face cream. I have sensitive combination skin and this cream smells delightful and makes my skin look younger.</li>
    <li> I ordered this lotion because J Lo said she uses it.  It&#x27;s wonderful.  Of course I&#x27;m never going to look like Jennifer but my skin really looks the best it has in a long time.  I&#x27;ve paid 5 times as much for a facial lotion and not had this good result.</li>
    <li> This is a good lotion that soaks in well.  It smells fantastic, very much like real roses. I would probably like something slightly more robust but since it isn&#x27;t advertised as a cream, it makes sense.</li>
    <li> I love Weleda products and I really wanted to love this face cream, but I couldn&#x27;t. It smells fresh and wonderful, but It really irritated my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I love this face lotion. It is light, non-greasy yet leaves me feeling hydrated and smells wonderful. Thank you Weleda!</li>
    <li> This works very well.  It smells great and moisturizes.  It was a little less firm- more liquidy than I expected but that really isn&#x27;t a problem.  It is expensive, but cheaper than many facial moisturizers and completely natural.</li>
    <li> Weleda&#x27;s Wild Rose line is a little confusing because there are a number of similarly named products under this line (e.g., Smoothing Day Cream, etc.).  I have tried them all and was not crazy about any of them except for this one (Smoothing Facial Lotion).  This one is a great.  I have used it for years at night in combination with Weleda&#x27;s Cold Cream. The combination of the two creates a perfect consistency for a potent &amp; healthy night cream.</li>
    <li> Only a little dab is needed of this surprisingly light moisturizer. Absorbs quickly. Strong rose scent when first applied but it quickly dissipates - which is good for someone fragrance-sensitive like me. This is a keeper.</li>
    <li> Love the scent of this lotion.</li>
    <li> I swear by this lotion. I won&#x27;t use anything else. I no longer have to change lotion with seasons. Always gives me balanced moisture, no greasy feeling &amp; no blemishes (even at that time of the month!)</li>
    <li> Really wanted to love this since i use Weleda products on my baby. While I like a bit of scent and usually do not like unscented items, The smell is really strong and not natural. Lotion doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything different from my other moisturizers.</li>
    <li> This has a very nice texture and smell. You can tell its &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; and not a faux rose smell. It feels gentle and soothing as well, and it actually goes into your skin instead of just staying on top of it all shiny. I did not even realize my skin felt a little stressed, until I tried this and it felt soothed!</li>
    <li> My baby suffered from eczema on her face and body.  We tried all sorts of lotions and creams, even Vaseline per our doctors suggestion with no success. However, this lotion cleared it up within a few days. Amazing!</li>
    <li> I love most of Weleda products and this is no an exception. I truly enjoy Wild Rose line in winter - it is very rich and comforting to your skin. And now they have this thinner lotion that is great for summers. What&#x27;s not to love! It works well in your skin, leaving it smooth and soft. And this small tube will last a long time, you only need a small drop - it is that moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I first received a sample of this moisturizer from Birchbox over a year ago and I haven&#x27;t stopped using it since. I have dry, breakout prone, skin and this is simply the best moisturizer I have ever used, not to mention the best smelling. I have tried nearly every brand on the market and none have made my skin look and feel better than this one. Also, this lotion is very powerful and you only need a small amount each day so it lasts for quite a while.</li>
    <li> I tried a sample of this in a local shop and fell in love with the wild rose smell.  Plus my hands felt good after using it.  I was going to buy it right then until I checked the price.  Yikes.&lt;br /&gt;Checked it on Amazon a few days later.  Much less in price and was even better when I did subscribe and save.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not one who uses hand creams and such but this smells and feels so great.  It will get me through the hard cold winters here in the mountains.</li>
    <li> Smells a little off. Not sure if it is just the one I got. Nothing special about it. Definitely not worth the money!!</li>
    <li> I have been using Weleda for several years now. I absolutely love this product. I especially love using this lotion in the spring/summer. It&#x27;s light weight, smells divine, and is moisturizing without feeling greasy or heavy. I use this after my rose water toner. The combo for me has been great. I love the way my skin feels and looks. I&#x27;d highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This is one of my holy grail moisturizers, and I just love Weleda overall. It is a very small tube, doesn&#x27;t last long, so I use sparingly. I also use retin a regularly, in my anti aging regimen, but I was experiencing flakiness with it until a dermatologist told me you can mix your retin a with a mild moisturizer (not one with &#x27;actives&#x27; but a gentle neutral one) and it will still work and stop the flaking, and it has worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even alone though, in me it produces such a radiance in my skin with regular use, which I attribute to the wild rose (and other gentle ingredients that don&#x27;t irritate my skin.) Some people have complained about the smell but they must have gotten a &#x27;bad&#x27; batch or something, because the scent of this is very subtle and lovely.</li>
    <li> I am late 30s, have combination skin (oily on nose, dry on forehead) I  prefer to use Skin Food for my go-to facial moisturizer (my husband uses it too for his very sensitive skin). This smoothing facial lotion, has a very light texture, a nice eye area cream -- while Skinfood is thicker and feels more effective to me. Smell is nice, I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again because it&#x27;s just not what I&#x27;m personally looking for.</li>
    <li> This is a great facial lotion! Absorbs quickly and has a nice light rose fragrance. Will be buying this again!</li>
    <li> Quite smelly (rose), but it dissipates quickly. I like the smell, personally. Nice texture - not too thick or goopy. What I was surprised by was the alcohol in the lotion (second ingredient). I don&#x27;t notice it drying my face, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy it again, especially since it is so expensive.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin with an oily nose and dry chin and was skeptical that this lotion would work for me, but it was on sale and I decided to give it a go.  I&#x27;m so glad that I did!  The product absorbs so beautifully and is not greasy, even on my &amp;#34;oily spots&amp;#34;.  I use to use Origins, and when I washed my face at the end of the day, I could feel the lotion &amp;#34;washing off&amp;#34;.  Not so with this lotion.  There is nothing to wash off as all has been absorbed!  To top it off, the ingredients are 100% natural.  I&#x27;m hooked.  I do not like rose scent, but the smell of this lotion doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  If you&#x27;re questioning whether this lotion is for you, try it!  You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I use this on a regular basis, at night during the summer since it doesn&#x27;t have a sunscreen, and all the time in the winter.  It is strong enough for me to keep my skin from drying out in the winter yet not too thick so that I get greasy in the summer.  I really appreciate the nice rose smell and that it is natural.  The extra few dollars over grocery store brands is more than worth it.  I used to use very expensive brands like Dermalogica but this one is cheaper and works as well if not better.  Thanks Weleda.  :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an excellent oil free product that keeps the face smooth all day long</li>
    <li> This lotion is good, it absorbs well, and keeps my very dry skin moisturized. The scent on the other hand is too much for me. It reminds me too much of an older lady scent and I am very sensitive to smells. I will not be repurchasing this and cannot wait until it is used up.</li>
    <li> The product is as described, I like it.</li>
    <li> I really love the smell and how this hydrates your face while giving you color.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because this is herbal based, but it just makes your skin glow and fragrance is not cloying. Try it!</li>
    <li> I nice, light scent. I use this as a daytime moisturizer. It&#x27;s not too heavy and not greasy. I like Weleda products, and a great value!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years (I&#x27;m 42 so I&#x27;m in the &amp;#34;recommended age range/skin type&amp;#34; unfortunately!). It goes on lightly but is surprisingly moisturizing, and I often get compliments on my skin looking much younger. One tube lasts me almost 6 months.</li>
    <li> Smells awesome and feels great on the skin</li>
    <li> Love the smell and it does make my skin smooth. And Amazon has the best price on this facial lotion!  By the way, the smell is subtle and clean smelling.</li>
    <li> Works great, i have no skin problems. Great to know i&#x27;m not putting potentially dangerous chemicals on my skin. Chemicals get absorbed through skin and enter the bloodtream and affect the whole body.</li>
    <li> This feels and smells great!</li>
    <li> Wonderful stuff.  Smells great and leaves my skin dewy</li>
    <li> This product comes in a small amount. The entire thing is about the size of two travel-size toothpastes. The price is therefore a little expensive for the amount that you&#x27;re getting. Other than that, the moisturizer itself is decent. The scent can initially be overwhelming and medicinal/herby smelling but the smell fades and there is a very faint lingering scent of roses for a couple of minutes afterwards. If you are a fan of Weleda because of their thick, creamy texture, you may be disappointed with the texture of this product because it is more watery and absorbs fast.</li>
