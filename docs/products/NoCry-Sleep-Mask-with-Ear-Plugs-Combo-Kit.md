      <li>It does okay</li>
      <li>I really love this mask.</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
      <li>though it is the only one I&#x27;ve tried, so this could be the best.</li>
      <li>So, I needed a sleep mask urgently to rest better during the day.</li>
      <li>Maybe more therapeutic feel.....</li>
      <li>This mask is very comfortable and keeps light out during daytime naps</li>
      <li>asleep much better and dont see the light changes.</li>
      <li>I received the package very quick</li>
      <li>It is well made and easy to use.</li>
      <li>The ear plugs lasted about a week before becoming unusable, but they were free so no complaints.</li>
      <li>The NoCry sleep mask is adjustable, very comfortable and it really does block out all the light!</li>
      <li>It makes huge difference when you sleep.</li>
      <li>I still see light thru the bottom...</li>
      <li>My laptop and all of my college needs fit inside.</li>
      <li>, he can see light through the bottom of it around his nose, though.</li>
      <li>Blocks the light well.</li>
      <li>My husband likes to watch TV in bed and the changing of the light bothered me</li>
      <li>Comfortable with adjustable Velcro strap that also holds ear plugs.  </li>
      <li>I was excited to give it a try.</li>
      <li>Overall very pleased with the quality and usefulness of the product.</li>
      <li>I’ve had other sleep masks before this one, but this one is by far the best.</li>
      <li>Moderately comfortable (maybe my head is just too large.)</li>
      <li>This mask blocks out any light or noise that used to wake me up during nights or especially early mornings.</li>
      <li>Very comfy, adjustable strap to fit anyone&#x27;s head.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly and was exactly as described.</li>
      <li>This is most important prior to the first use.</li>
      <li>The padding is just right.</li>
      <li>This little thing makes this sleep mask far more effective.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t know if it is 7am or noon, it completely blocks out light.</li>
      <li>The mask is okay, it seems bigger on the woman&#x27;s head in the picture.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t explain exactly what I was expecting.  </li>
      <li>, it has velcro in the back for better adjusment.  </li>
      <li>and I have a large head.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The mask has directions for washing, but I like washing things in HOT, or at least warm, and then being able to throw them in the dryer after for final disinfecting.</li>
      <li>It allows no light in, even with the bedroom light and my wife&#x27;s light on her nightstand on.  </li>
      <li>My husband started working 2nd shift and wanted some cover from the light while he slept during the day.</li>
      <li>I like the extra material over the nose to block out as much light as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two</li>
      <li>Most things that go anywhere near my face, especially my eyes, I buy hypoallergenic.</li>
      <li>I was expecting a little more.  </li>
      <li>the velcro close,,,,it pulls my hair,,,its just too much trouble to send bac:)</li>
      <li>This sleep mask seems to work so well because it has a little flap that covers the extra space at the top of your nose and between your eyes to block out extra light.</li>
      <li>Combined with the ear plugs I can travel in real comfort despite snoring passengers sleeping next to me!</li>
      <li>so they expand and block out loud noise.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>Now I’m sleeping 8 to 9 hours straight without waking up in the middle.</li>
      <li>The Earplugs at first were ok but are virtually useless</li>
      <li>It was missing an earplug on arrival, luckily we didn&#x27;t care about that.</li>
      <li>my husband love it cuts out annoying lights and noises at night for a better sleep</li>
      <li>major peeves about this mask (</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s simple, and the material feels nice, but the smell is still faintly there after a couple months of being aired out.  </li>
      <li>The only complaint I have is the strong chemical smell that was present upon opening, but it went away after use of about a week.</li>
      <li>so the fit is not good for me.  </li>

<li> so the fit is not good for me.  </li>
<li> Ear plugs should be thicker, then twisted to fit in the ear</li>
<li> From long time ago the daylight bothers me a lot when I try to sleep.</li>
<li> This is a small one but, if they&#x27;re going to be advertised as part of the package, they should live up to their role.</li>
<li> As is there&#x27;s just a couple of loose squeezable earplugs.</li>
<li> I  will use this mask for a long time!!!</li>
<li> Let&#x27;s no light in due to the extra piece that goesover the bridge of the nose.</li>
<li> Too small for my face, need a larger replacement please.</li>
<li> but if you have thick hair or a big head, it&#x27;s EXTREMELY tight (My Velcro adjuster is maxed out) and over the course of about 3 weeks, a crease forms where it starts to bend to conform to your eye cavity which can be pretty darn painful waking up to in the middle of the night.</li>
<li> the directions to wash this mask: cold water, gentle cycle/hand wash, and then hang dry.</li>
<li> The Velcro is not thick or uncomfortable.  </li>
<li> I wanted a little heavier feeling on my eye....</li>
<li> I like the little ear plug keepers on the band as I am always loosing them.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now.  </li>
<li> I’ve had trouble sleeping for ages due to my shallow sleep problem.</li>
<li> These items came from China so they had that awful chemical smell that most of what I&#x27;ve gotten smells like.</li>
<li> , they had these weird black scuff marks on them.</li>
<li> ear plugs are not good</li>
<li> I am a bit of disgusted by germs of any sort, and the thought that chemicals were probably responsible for the odor....and those chemicals were going to be on my eyes for 8 hours...</li>
<li> The mask smelt weird after I removed it from the package, so it took me forever to muster up the courage to try using it.  </li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now.  The Earplugs at first were ok but are virtually useless now.&lt;br /&gt;The mask itself was alright in the beginning but if you have thick hair or a big head, it&#x27;s EXTREMELY tight (My Velcro adjuster is maxed out) and over the course of about 3 weeks, a crease forms where it starts to bend to conform to your eye cavity which can be pretty darn painful waking up to in the middle of the night.</li>
    <li> Comfortable with adjustable Velcro strap that also holds ear plugs.  The Velcro is not thick or uncomfortable.  I toss and turn a lot while sleeping.  It stays on throughout the night and until I take it off when I get up don&#x27;t know if it is 7am or noon, it completely blocks out light.</li>
    <li> This mask is very comfortable and keeps light out during daytime naps so I can rest. I like the little ear plug keepers on the band as I am always loosing them.  I can also use it with my APAP mask which is critical. It is well made and easy to use. I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Very comfy, adjustable strap to fit anyone&#x27;s head. The padding is just right. Let&#x27;s no light in due to the extra piece that goesover the bridge of the nose. The ear plugs lasted about a week before becoming unusable, but they were free so no complaints. The only complaint I have is the strong chemical smell that was present upon opening, but it went away after use of about a week. Overall very pleased with the quality and usefulness of the product.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT. My husband likes to watch TV in bed and the changing of the light bothered me but now with my sleep mask I can fall  asleep much better and dont see the light changes.</li>
    <li> Best backpack I&#x27;ve ever had, I absolutely love it . My laptop and all of my college needs fit inside.</li>
    <li> ear plugs are not good an I dont like the velcro close,,,,it pulls my hair,,,its just too much trouble to send bac:)</li>
    <li> I really love this mask. Bought it for my daily naps as I have to work on night shifts. I was pleasantly surprised. The NoCry sleep mask is adjustable, very comfortable and it really does block out all the light!</li>
    <li> Mask works well but the earplugs need to be replaced with better quality not a deal breaker</li>
    <li> Blocks the light well. Moderately comfortable (maybe my head is just too large.)</li>
    <li> Confortable and effective</li>
    <li> It was missing an earplug on arrival, luckily we didn&#x27;t care about that. My husband started working 2nd shift and wanted some cover from the light while he slept during the day. The mask is okay, it seems bigger on the woman&#x27;s head in the picture. If you&#x27;re shopping for a man, I&#x27;d suggest getting a larger one. It does okay, he can see light through the bottom of it around his nose, though.</li>
    <li> Too small for my face, need a larger replacement please.</li>
    <li> The mask smelt weird after I removed it from the package, so it took me forever to muster up the courage to try using it.  It&#x27;s simple, and the material feels nice, but the smell is still faintly there after a couple months of being aired out.  I like the extra material over the nose to block out as much light as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two major peeves about this mask (though it is the only one I&#x27;ve tried, so this could be the best. I have no clue.)&lt;br /&gt;1.) The smell. And my fear about allergic reaction. Most things that go anywhere near my face, especially my eyes, I buy hypoallergenic. I am a bit of disgusted by germs of any sort, and the thought that chemicals were probably responsible for the odor....and those chemicals were going to be on my eyes for 8 hours...&lt;br /&gt;The mask has directions for washing, but I like washing things in HOT, or at least warm, and then being able to throw them in the dryer after for final disinfecting. This is most important prior to the first use. HOWEVER....the directions to wash this mask: cold water, gentle cycle/hand wash, and then hang dry. I was torn because I didn&#x27;t want to ruin it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.) This is a small one but, if they&#x27;re going to be advertised as part of the package, they should live up to their role. THE EAR PLUGS. They are these skinny, yellow plugs that block zero noise. Things were not even muffled. Ear plugs should be thicker, then twisted to fit in the ear so they expand and block out loud noise. These are too skinny for that.&lt;br /&gt;Also, they had these weird black scuff marks on them. I just tossed them out.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a little more.  I wanted a little heavier feeling on my eye.... I can&#x27;t explain exactly what I was expecting.  Maybe more therapeutic feel..... is what I am trying to say.  I still see light thru the bottom... so the fit is not good for me.  I&#x27;ve thrown eye wear like this away from airlines.</li>
    <li> Great product at a reasonable price!</li>
    <li> I’ve had other sleep masks before this one, but this one is by far the best. This sleep mask seems to work so well because it has a little flap that covers the extra space at the top of your nose and between your eyes to block out extra light. This little thing makes this sleep mask far more effective. It makes huge difference when you sleep.</li>
    <li> From long time ago the daylight bothers me a lot when I try to sleep. So, I needed a sleep mask urgently to rest better during the day. But I was hesitant because I don&#x27;t like anything on my face. However when I saw this mask with the earplugs attached I was excited to give it a try. I received the package very quick and I tried it the same day. Now I just can tell you this: it is very light and  comfy on my eyes. , it has velcro in the back for better adjusment.  No lights go through it at all and the earplugs add better resting because the sounds around me are zero! And the price is unbeatable. I am so happy i bought this ! I  will use this mask for a long time!!!</li>
    <li> This mask is really comfortable and does a great job blocking out light. Combined with the ear plugs I can travel in real comfort despite snoring passengers sleeping next to me!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this sleep mask for a couple of months now and it works great. I’ve had trouble sleeping for ages due to my shallow sleep problem. This mask blocks out any light or noise that used to wake me up during nights or especially early mornings. Now I’m sleeping 8 to 9 hours straight without waking up in the middle. I can’t say enough to express my gratitude. Thanks guys, great product!</li>
    <li> my husband love it cuts out annoying lights and noises at night for a better sleep</li>
    <li> The mask is comfortable and with Velcro strips it fits perfectly and I have a large head. It allows no light in, even with the bedroom light and my wife&#x27;s light on her nightstand on.  The only thing I would advise the manufacturer is to place the ear plugs on a stretchable cord attached to the mask.  As is there&#x27;s just a couple of loose squeezable earplugs.</li>
    <li> These items came from China so they had that awful chemical smell that most of what I&#x27;ve gotten smells like. Even after washing twice I still couldn&#x27;t use. I threw the ear plugs away</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and was exactly as described.</li>
