      <li>I chose this product because I chose it before, and it&#x27;s a fine product.</li>
      <li>This is an Excellent anti-aging product I have used previously.  </li>
      <li>Thankfully it is very inexpensive and easy to make your own.</li>
      <li>It was wrapped in bubble wrap and in a padded envelope and made it to me fine, but I wonder if its a genuine Skinceuticals product since it didn&#x27;t come in the box-which is lightweight, so it shouldn&#x27;t have added to your shipping costs.  </li>

      <li>feel  my skin look much better thanks again for being so prompt.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and absolutely love it, however, something is not right with this order. I don&#x27;t know if it is the seller or if the manufacturer changed the forumula, but this is not what I&#x27;ve bought in the past. It actually stings when I put it on. It smells and feels like its been cut with salycilic acid which is used in some skin products, but has not been part of this one in the past.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite skin product.  It adds so many needed nutrients to my skin!  I wish I could purchase  this in a larger quantity.</li>
    <li> This oil is doing an amazing job on my skin. It is very good for sensitive skin. I find the bottle last me about 3 months.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 5 years.  I love it but the product I just received from Amazon smells like fish.  Very disappointed. Will NOT order from them again.</li>
    <li> Use every day and feel it has made a big difference for my face. I highly recommend it for everyone.</li>
    <li> I have to laugh at all of the people who waste their money on this product. At least here on Amazon the price is not as steep but on other sites people pay something like $146 for this!! Here is a little tip for you all: YOU CAN BUY \\&quot;L-ascorbic acid\\&quot; ONLINE FOR CHEAP!!! You can mix up your own serum fresh daily or weekly and get all the benefits of this and actually better benefits because it will be fresh. Also, the little product info that states that if the product turns yellow or orange it is OK? WRONG!!!!! Once it is \\&quot;oxidized\\&quot; it contains free radicals and is worse for your skin than using nothing. In fact, free radicals will age your skin so it should be discarded the moment it turns yellow or orange. The manufacturer won&#x27;t admit this because they know that there is absolutely no possible way to make L-ascorbic acid stable in a formula. YOU MUST MAKE IT FRESH IN ORDER TO BENEFIT FROM THIS FABULOUS AND EFFECTIVE INGREDIENT. Thankfully it is very inexpensive and easy to make your own. Please check out the DIY recipes all over the web; your skin and your pocketbook will thank you!</li>
    <li> The pump is not easy to use. Have been using for the past 5 months and didn&#x27;t see any minor or major improvements. Disappointing.</li>
    <li> I am 55 but have been tagged as being in my late thirties.  This is amazing. I have been using it ever since my dermatologist recommended it 5 years ago.  I use it daily (about 4 drops), with over the counter moisturizer with sunscreen.  At night I use Skinceuticals AGE eye complex and Skinceuticals AGE night cream.  Twice a week I use .5 retinol.  My screen is amazing smooth, with few age spots.  I am a weekly golfer who lives in the south, and apply extra sunscreen when playing but I owe much of the credit to C E Ferulic.  A bit costly, but 1 fl oz. lasts about 2 months.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for several years and believe it actually protects and improves my skin.  So many products over promise and under deliver.</li>
    <li> really good for my dry aging skin - feels good to use it  feel  my skin look much better thanks again for being so prompt.</li>
    <li> I live for this product.  I&#x27;ve been a dedicated user for probably 5 years now.  No complaints.  Will always buy this no matter the price...</li>
    <li> Thought I would give this a try since I want to do correction and preventive treatments for my skin. The smell is not so bothersome and I think it does give my skin a firmer healthy look. I really hate the glass bottle and stopper though. Accidently knocked it over and spilled half down the drain!</li>
    <li> I have been using it for the last 3 years. Great for skin, use it every morning and I get complimented very often that I look ten years younger than my age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it you will love it.</li>
    <li> I have been using CE Ferulic for 6-7 years, since my dermatologist recommended it.  I use 4 drops daily on the back of my hand, spreading at least 3 on my face, then rubbing the backs of my hands together.  Hands and face both look years younger than most almost 70-year olds.  I use a moisturizer over it, as it&#x27;s not enough alone.  Compared to moisturizer only, CE Ferulic smooths my skin, seems to prevent new wrinkles, and seems to prevent age spots on my hands (I don&#x27;t have any).  My dermatologist has ageless skin--she&#x27;s at least in her late fifties, but looks 40.  If it&#x27;s good enough for her, it&#x27;s definitely good enough for me.  It&#x27;s expensive, but it lasts for many months.  I love it and expect to continue to use it daily.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by a good local spa.  I have been using it on my face for some time now.  I used to always get dry spots on my skin due to allergies.  This seems to be preventing these &#x27;rashes&#x27; from occurring.</li>
    <li> I have heard phenomenal things about CE Ferulic by Skinceuticals and was directed to use it by my dermatologist. But instead of paying full price, I thought I&#x27;d save some money and order it from amazon. I received my product and put it on the first time, and it smelled like salami. Didn&#x27;t think this was normal. The product is also slightly yellowish in color and it&#x27;s supposed to be crystal clear. I am returning it today. I will be ordering the original product from the original Skinceuticals line.</li>
    <li> I just love this product, brings a glow to my face and makes it so soft! I love the ease of applicatiom. It brightens myskin, makes it feel so much better and I think it has been a great product for me.</li>
    <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;This looks okay, but I am surprised that it wasn&#x27;t in the box that Skinceuticals normally packs it in.  It was wrapped in bubble wrap and in a padded envelope and made it to me fine, but I wonder if its a genuine Skinceuticals product since it didn&#x27;t come in the box-which is lightweight, so it shouldn&#x27;t have added to your shipping costs.  There are a lot of counterfeits on Amazon and this makes me suspicious.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years. It feels like I am nurturing my cells more than any other product I use.  I use obagi products daily along with C E Ferulic.  I live in a tropical climate and if I haven&#x27;t put sun screen on and spend time out side  accidentally, I seem to get protection from the daily use of this product.</li>
    <li> When I opened the bottle the product didn&#x27;t smell right.  I had some product from a prior purchase and it smelled completely different.  I did try it on my face and I had to wash it off as my skin started to itch.  The price was the lowest offered by any vendor and now I know why.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a minimalist when it comes to facial products, but this is one I won&#x27;t do without. Skinceuticals CE Ferulic is effective. I use it every day along with moisturizer and eye cream and the appearance of my skin even at nearly 70 years old is, I&#x27;m positive, better for it. (I&#x27;ve been using this serum for almost 10 years now.)</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years.  I is one of the best products on the market.  You see results within 2 weeks of using.  Will not do with out.  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Awesome serum. Just a little goes a long way and the results are quick! I will definitely reorder this product!</li>
    <li> the product arrived quickly and exactly as expected. I am nor sure that it has given me the young look I wanted, but I also have not used it as diligently as i am supposed to. I can say that when I use it, my skin does feel more nourished and smooth. I would like to see more of an effect on eveness of skin tone!</li>
    <li> I have three years using it and i&#x27;ll keep doing it, I have dry and normal skin and it leaves your skin smooth and a different way that no other cream can do, it is a warranty, use it after cleaning your face and before anything else.</li>
    <li> I really like the product and have used it for years now. It gives my face a nice youthful glow while protecting it from the sun. I spent $105 which is almost $50 less then if I&#x27;d purchased directly through Skinceuticals.</li>
    <li> been using it for several years....awesome product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It delivers on what it says it will deliver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not STOP buying it!</li>
    <li> Every facialist I see tells me this is the ONE and only product you need. I don&#x27;t go a day without it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years and still like it. A bit pricey I think but it lasts a long time. There is always a lot of discussion about the smell and color variations of this product. I keep my big bottle in the fridge and use the mini bottles in my bathroom (you can buy those in packs of six- they  travel well and are easy to use)</li>
    <li> I feel like that it&#x27;s almost perfect item because i can see that bright and tight skin in my face.</li>
    <li> This is an Excellent anti-aging product I have used previously.  I highly recommend it as a part of a skincare routine.</li>
    <li> I love this product and have used it often even now that I&#x27;m 60.  I wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricy though.</li>
    <li> My skin feels comfortable and firmed up as soon as I put it on. I also wear it to my bust. ^^ I use it only in the morning.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this so much, but it did not work for my skin! My skin was irritated and I started to get little bumps, not happy. I did like the B5 hydrating gel though, which I used with the CFerulic. Sensitive skin people beware.</li>
    <li> I have used this for several years, love what it does for my skin, seems to make wrinkles just disappear.  I am 72 years old and most people think I look at least 10-15 years younger.  I use once a day in the A.M. and then apply Skinceuticals moisture cream.  This is a must if you want great looking skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product and use it daily.  It is expensive and not much product for the money...I have to reorder more often than I would like but I still love the product.</li>
    <li> This was my first time trying C E Ferulic. Totally love the way my skin feels. Very pleased with Skinceuticals products and will continue to purchase more.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Skinceuticals.</li>
    <li> Super good for the skin! Controls oil, reduces hyperpigmentation &amp; fights free radicals &amp; aging! I&#x27;am an esthetician, I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since June 2013.  It has cleared my skin of any wrinkles or forming lines and has visually changed the evenness of my tone.  I am in love with this product!  I do, however, buy the formula from Skin Institute USA (Miami FL 305-3717435) for a fraction of the Skinceuticals price.  Their formula contains 20% L-ascorbic acid and that extra 5% makes a huge difference to the skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried it first at a spa and they were raving about it. When I bought it later, I used it under my daily moisturizer. After a few days I realized how much more even my skin looks. I have a lot of beauty marks, fraggle etc. but now my skin is so much smoother and so much more even. I love it. It&#x27;s absolutley amazing.</li>
    <li> Recommended by a dermatologist and enjoyed by many, this product is worth every penny.  It should come in a gallon size with a mister.  Immediate improvement of skin tone and texture.  This skinflint loves skinceuticals.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by a dermatology skin care specialist and I absolutely love it. My skin is showing such dramatic difference in tone and glow in such a short time of using this product.</li>
    <li> This product has completely revamped my skin. After 2 kids, my skin looked tired and I had hyper pigmentation and the uneven skintone. Using this every day has really helped even out my skintone and my skin looks younger and brighter. I also use Retin-A (gen Rx is Tretenoin) 2 - 3 times / week and I am so much happier with my face!</li>
    <li> I tend to try items Allure Magazine has reviewed and rate highly.  I have used this Skinceuticals product for many years.  There is no fountain of youth but this one definately helps my skin age gracefully.</li>
    <li> Same as much higher priced Skinceutical through my dermatologist.  Seems to really restore the collagen and eliminate those little facial wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Keep up the great job.&lt;br /&gt;Use the product every day, really notice a big difference.&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product, hoping it would smooth my skin and fade brown spots. After just a few weeks, I noticed it was doing nothing, except making the brown spots DARKER!  Not to mention, it smells like bacon--yuck!  I stopped using and bought Peter Thomas Roth&#x27;s PM Retinol serum, which I love, love, love!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a long time. Just love it. Gives the skin a very nice texture.</li>
    <li> One of the few product lines I have found that makes a real difference in my skin. I use the C &amp; E every morning. It has given my skin a glow and minimized lines.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years.Tried other products but always go back to my Skinceuticals.  Love how it feels and makes my skin look.</li>
    <li> Purchased this to help with some deep facial wrinkles. Within 2 days I noticed a difference. After a week, the skin is much smoother and I can feel the difference.</li>
    <li> Used this for several yrs.  I think that my face is smoother with help of this product! Also use the B5 serum.</li>
    <li> Do not apply heavy just a little goes a long way.  Can be sticky if you use to much.  Nice product, need to use longer to see if I really will order again.</li>
    <li> The product smells funny and it does not produce the skin tightening effects that I have with Obagi C serum. Hopefully it is not a fake watered down version.</li>
    <li> I think the price has stayed the same for half the quantity. Very disappointing. It would need to be a miracle in a bottle to cost this much and it&#x27;s not.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this.  I&#x27;ve liked the results and this is my second bottle.  I added the B5 gel and use the anti-aging eye cream.  It&#x27;s a great combination for my dry skin.</li>
    <li> It has been an effective skin protection oil to protect against sun and other environmental elements. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I chose this product because I chose it before, and it&#x27;s a fine product. A bit pricey, but still wonderful for my skin.</li>
    <li> I use this product every morning on clean skin.  This product was recommened by my dermatologist and is far superior to any other simular product.  When you apply skin ceuticals to your face, you feel the difference immediately. At 64, I have very few lines and can go without make up.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this product after reading so many reviews and paying $150.00. I bought it from Dermstore.com.&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and I am also very fair. This products causes white heads and redness...did not absorb very well.&lt;br /&gt;I did not even try to apply makeup on top of this, I felt I would look greasy. I will try it again...I paid a lot of money for it anyway. I will update my review after trying it for the second time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone had a similar reaction and tried another similar product and it worked for them I will appreciate a response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck to those that love the product!!!</li>
    <li> From what I can gather from the information here and other places once the product has turned from transparent to yellow it&#x27;s oxidized and shouldn&#x27;t be used or sold. Unfortunately there seems to be no way to ensure a clear solution even if buying directly from the manufacturer as I have; the sellers won&#x27;t throw the aged bottles away if they can be sold. I emailed Skinceuticals about this issue but they didn&#x27;t reply - draw your own conclusions from that. I won&#x27;t be buying this expensive product again.</li>
    <li> C E ferulic number one it Worke for all type of skin . I am big fan off this one been using last 5 years no complant , perfect . Or I will say best in market .</li>
    <li> The item arrive with a light yellow colour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it a couple of weeks and do notice that my face looks brighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it does not lighten my freckles, no smoother face nor smaller pores.</li>
    <li> I have been using the skinceuticals CE Ferrulic since January along with the Simply Clean cleanser (my favorite products so far).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser makes my skin clean and soft without making it dry. Previously, I washed my face in the shower and now I wash morning and night, followed by various skinceutical products. But this cleanser and CE Ferrulic have made the most immediate and obvious difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE THE CE FERRULIC! it has made an immediate improvement in my skin. It is brighter and healthier. It helps also to heal any ruptured pimple, etc. so it heals nicely.  My skin is so soft with it and my Aveeno calming moisturizer.  I haven&#x27;t yet moved to a Skinceuticals moisturizer, but I may when my Aveeno runs out, since I love this line so much. But I like my Aveeeno!  However, without the CE Ferrulic, my skin would not look so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past month I added AOX+ Eye gel in a.m. and A.G.E. eye fel at night, Phyto corrective cream in morning and evening, retexturing activator in evening and after my moisturizer (Aveeno ultra calming) I add in the morning the Skinceuticals physical UV defense spf 30 sunscreen. My skin started looking brighter when I first started the CE Ferrulic and it is looking overall better with the recent additions. People have noticed a change in my skin, stating it looks brighter and &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; without solicitation.</li>
    <li> It is probably good for dry skin but not for acne prone skin. Made me break out, will use the remainder of the product on my neck.</li>
    <li> Every women must have it.Since years i do use it and even now by skin matures it does wonders keeping the skin radiant and super healthy and firm.</li>
    <li> Since I started using C E Ferulic, I feel my skin does look better.  I have also noticed the lightening of dark spots and have received compliments on my skin. I cannot put my finger on exactly what I like about it, just that it seems to be doing something for my skin.  One important selling point to me, was that it acts as a sunblock of sorts.  It cannot say it has an SPF, but the clinical studies all seemed to support that it has protective properties to it.  So for those of you that put it on at night, you may want to reconsider your application time.  I do continue to use a SPF sunscreen moisturizer after I apply the C E Ferulic.  The odor takes some getting used too though.  Definitely an herb, medicinal smell (or to me it smells like bacon grease).</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist. My face is highly sensitive to unnatural substances. Since I began using this product, my face and neck no longer feel dry and itchy. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a great line - my dermatologist recommended this skincare line.  I use Retin-A plus Clarisonic, Active C and B5 in the morning  -plus the moisturizer.  You will need to use for more than a day to see results.  Remember it took more than a day to get the skin we worked for - it will take a few months to see results - it is worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jansimpson</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about 5 years and loved it but the last bottle I purchased it was a dark golden color, usually when I get a new bottle is a very light yellow/gold and it turns darker over time but this time it was much darker but I used it anyhow.  My face broke out in a small rash over, at first I didn&#x27;t think it was the Skinceutical CE because I had used it for years, I couldn&#x27;t figure it out.  I went to the doctor and was given some cream to use and was told to stop all creams/oils until it cleared up, which I did. Then I started using each item I usually used one thing at a time moisturizer, night cream and skinceuticals CE, etc. and every time the same thing, a rash would appear, I thought it can&#x27;t be the skinceutical CE I&#x27;ve used it for a long time it has to be something else.  I stopped everything again and used only skinceutical CE and to my amasement it was the skinceutical CE.  I really liked it up until now.  I&#x27;m not sure if my rating is a good one or not because I really liked it until now.  It&#x27;s cost me a lot of money for the product and then the doctor&#x27;s visit and the meds.  I don&#x27;t know if anyone has experienced a rash before but just be aware it could happen.</li>
    <li> Mt wife loves this product!!!!</li>
    <li> Have used this product for 9 years now with excellent results.  Prefer the dropper serums vs. the lotion type since it leaves my drier skin more &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34;.  I use this under my regular moisturizer.  Previously have purchased this in medi-spas or directly from Skinceuticals&#x27; website but prices better with Amazon suppliers.  Just wish this was an Amazon Prime eligible item because it can take a week or so to receive :(</li>
    <li> I really like it.  Am 58 years old and happy to find something that helps maintain my skin.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I read other reviews and could not agree more.  This product makes your face look better and over 3 days most issues that you have go away.</li>
    <li> This was highly rated by a panel of dermatologists in a magazine review of anti-aging products. I can&#x27;t see any difference after several weeks. In addition, I don&#x27;t like the smell, and it is quite expensive. I do NOT recommend the product!</li>
    <li> I love my Skin Ceuticals C E Ferulic. It is a great product, a a great price. I will definitely order it again through Amazon.</li>
