    <li> Love this product. I&#x27;m in the nursing field and the constant hand washing is so hard on my hands. It makes my hands smooth and my nails aren&#x27;t splitting like usual. Ordered from amazon because Walmart didn&#x27;t carry the &amp;#34;hand and cuticle therapy&amp;#34; only the regular Curel lotion</li>
    <li> I do a lot of rock climbing and my hands are pretty beaten up from rubbing on rocks and the dryness of chalk. This hand cream takes care of my hand very well compared to other similar products available in the pharmacy.</li>
    <li> I have not received it as of 5-25-15.  I do like the product by Curel, just would like to have it.</li>
    <li> Great for those extra dry body parts like elbows and knees. I keep this tub at my computer and bedside table.</li>
    <li> Winter is upon us and boy do my hands get dry and chapped. I keep this in my purse and apply it throughout the day. By far my favorite hand lotion!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this product for about a year now. I don&#x27;t know about it lasting 24 hours, but my hands to stay nice and soft during the winter. Good at keeping the cuticles moisturized. You will feel the difference.</li>
    <li> I HATE HAND CREAMS - they&#x27;re always too greasy, too thin, or have too strong a smell. I tried this one out because it claimed to be fast absorbing...and I&#x27;m now a fervent Curel devotee. I&#x27;ve never used a hand cream that softened so quickly (immediately!), and certainly not one that really kept its fast-absorbing promise. I rub some on my hands and can go straight to typing on my laptop or shaking someone&#x27;s hand. It&#x27;s beautiful and magical. It feels wonderful. Smell is light, pleasant, and doesn&#x27;t stick on you.     Tube is just big enough to feel useful but also small enough to stick in a bag. Totally amazing.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hand lotion! Not greasy and absorbs leaving my hands feeling so healed after this hard winter air dried them out. Has a nice mild scent that dissipates quickly.</li>
    <li> My hands and cuticles always seem to get dry, especially in Winter. This cream absorbs well, non greasy and it stays on my skin through hand washing as well. I will reorder this cream.</li>
    <li> Curel lotion in general is the only lotion that takes care of my very dry hands in winter. This type of Curel is excellent and great size for purse. Nothing else works on my dry, dry, hands and fingers in winter. I live in NE USA and wash my hands A LOT!</li>
    <li> My hands feel so soft after using this lotion. I am seeing improvement in the cuticle area.</li>
    <li> Absorbes quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my hands greasy. For someone who washes their hands multiple times a day, this is a perfect choice for hand cream.</li>
    <li> Smells great. And is non greasy. Leaves hands smooth and silky. Would buy again from here because they stopped selling it in stores</li>
    <li> I love this product and ordered several tubes.  It really does work!</li>
    <li> My wife likes this cream very much. First of all it has good components providing for softeness of the  dry hands. Secondly,this cream abserb very fast,because it does not have oil base.</li>
    <li> Although the design is a bit different (I had such a cream before), it still work great. It helps to heal my daughters finger, her skin is dry at summer.</li>
    <li> you will not find a better lotion.  It moisturizes without the greasy feel.</li>
    <li> It seriously do what it says! its very moisturizing and makes my hands very soft &amp; my cuticles love it.</li>
    <li> The cream has nice texture - not too light but not the one which will bother you during the day or at night. The smell is not too perfumy either. Does the job too.</li>
    <li> This lotion is GREAT!  It doesn&#x27;t leave my hands greasy at all.</li>
    <li> This stuff is non-greasy and really soaks in.</li>
    <li> My friend recommended this cream to me and I absolutely love it.  It isn&#x27;t too thick and absorbs into the hands quickly, but my hands feel much softer after a few uses.  Definitely recommend.</li>
