<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Ce Ferulic is excelent !</li>
    <li> This product is awesome - not only do I notice the difference in my skin, but so do other people.  I have been using it for years and it is great.</li>
    <li> This was highly recommended by an aesthetician.  I used it for nearly a year, and saw absolutely no difference.  Don&#x27;t waste your money - there&#x27;s a lot out there that&#x27;s good for a lot less.</li>
    <li> With oily skin, this works just great and I follow it up with the Hydrating B5 Gel.  A winning combination for me.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for my older skin.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over a month and I don&#x27;t see that it is doing anything.  It also has an odd metallic smell so I apply it with a cotton ball so it doesn&#x27;t get on my hands.  Due to the cost, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll order it again.  I keep going back to Clarins firming products.</li>
    <li> Used this product for years.  My skin is smooth and wrinkle free.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my dermatologist three years ago and I have faithfully used it since then - and absolutely love it!  I rub any extra on the backs of my hands as it not only provides the protection of free-radicals, but is an excellent sunscreen and healer.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best skin care product on the market.  I use several years back and was talked into using another brand.  My skin has never been the same.  Have come back and will never change again.  I could tell the difference the minute I but it on and in two days my skin was  back.  No more flaking, redness or dry spots.  It works better than what the dermatologist prescribed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use with Lancome Absolute Premium BX Night Replenishing moisturizer and I am once again getting comments on how good my skin looks.  It only takes a little and will last for a long time.</li>
    <li> I opened my bottle, it was so fresh it popped like a bottle of champagne when I opened, it smell fresh and tingled! Very happy! ☺️</li>
    <li> Even though this product is very pricey , I&#x27;m addicted to it . I think it really works unlike a lot of products on the market . And I think I save money on buying the pro size .</li>
    <li> Hydrates well.  Like this product</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and appreciate the protection it provides for sun exposure, the brightening of my skin and certain amount of firmness.</li>
    <li> I love the way it makes my skin look and feel.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Used it several years ago and just came back to it. Wish I had never stopped using it. I have sensitive skin. I usually just mix it with a little face lotion. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I am an aesthetician and I no longer work for a doctor that carries this product. It is so amazing that I HAVE to keep using it. This product that I ordered was exactly the same as I used to get when I ordered it. It was sealed and the product if fresh. Thanks for offering this thru amazon. I will continue to purchase it.</li>
    <li> Been using it for years. Love it. Evens out skin tone and helps texture as well .</li>
    <li> packaged perfect and arrived ahead of schedule.  Great product</li>
    <li> I love it! I am pleased to have this larger bottle available. Delivery of product was fast!</li>
    <li> This compnay has great values on their products; fast shipping; good customer service.  I am a continued customer.  Product itself is amazing.  been on it for years; always getting complements on my skin.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST serum I have ever used.  I am 60 years old and after using this for 6 months, I have had multiple people (my doc, etc.)  tell me that I look like I am in my early 50s.  I HIGHLY recommend this product.  The price is worth it and it lasts for quite a while. I use it on my face and neck.</li>
    <li> I use a lot of the skin ceutical products and love that I was able to get the larger professional size in this particular product . They are a very  well respected skin line and of great quality . I use many of their products .</li>
    <li> This is the best skin product i have ever used, I have used it for years. I put it on the first thing in the morning after I wash my face it gives my skin a young and healthy glow. Everyone comments on my skin and wants to know what products I use and I tell them i use Skin Ceuticals C E Ferulic . it&#x27;s the best.</li>
    <li> This is a pricy item for me. However, it was recommended by a dermatologist. I have been using this item since October 2013 and I like it very much. It is suppose to help against harmful sun rays and it is suppose to give a person extra U V protection. I bought the larger size this time because it was more economical. It was not shipped in a box, but it was wrapped well and arrived in a mailer.</li>
    <li> Excelent product and very effective.</li>
    <li> I have used SkinCeuticals CE Ferulic for the past 16 years in conjunction with SkinCeuticals B5 Hydrating Gel. Although I am 66 years old, most people don&#x27;t believe me when I tell them my age.  Absolutely LOVE that! Amazon&#x27;s shipping is fantastic...received the product PRIOR to the promised date!</li>
    <li> Not sure if this is the real stuff from Skinceuticals. The color of serum is much lighter and scent is not nearly as strong as the sample products provided by my dermatologist from a week ago.  Makes me wonder if this is the real deal?</li>
    <li> I had a precancerous rather rough spot on my nose that I credit this product for erasing.  Ferulic acid is known to help remove cancer cells.</li>
    <li> SkinCeuticals CE Ferulic was recommended to me by a dermatologist I began to see regularly as a follow up to two episodes of Melanoma. The dermatologist was very thorough during the introductory exam to address all areas of skin care for my sun sensitive Scandinavian skin type exposed to the south Texas sun.  She recommended C E Ferulic as an everyday first product on my face to protect my skin from further sun damage that would produce fine lines and wrinkles, uneven coloration, and possible other skin cancers. I began using the product sparingly as it was a bit pricey for my budget at the time.  Several times since I have seen independent reviews for CE Ferulic listing it among the &#x27;product to splurge on&#x27;, the product &#x27;never to do without&#x27;. I followed that advice and now, 16 years later at 58 years of age, I get asked monthly, (no exaggeration!) what skin product I use to keep my skin so healthy (beautiful for my age was how one lovely 35 year old put it). While my skin shows all the wrinkles of a well lived life: the smile and expressive lines that just come with age, my skin does not have the sun damage as seen in fine lines/wrinkles, discolorations, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not give this product up; I recommend it to everyone who asks me about my skin&#x27;s condition. I only regret not using it on my chest and neck from the beginning: I do now.  One last thing, when I lived in Europe a few years ago, the skin care specialist there also recommends C E Ferulic to her clients with as much zealousness as I recommend it to you!</li>
    <li> Have been using this serum for years.  It really the only beauty product that is worth paying a high price for.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this a few years ago.  I feel the difference when I use it.  I recommend it.  He suggested I use it w/the hyaluronic one.  It&#x27;s part of my routine.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve found--been using in AM for several years&lt;br /&gt;(used non brand sub past year--not so good),&lt;br /&gt;use rx retinoid at noc + daily sunblock.&lt;br /&gt;62yo, have few wrinkles, fair elasticity,&lt;br /&gt;very little photoaging. will continue to use as long&lt;br /&gt;as i have the money!</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this product for years and she looks amaseing.</li>
    <li> SkinCeuticals CE Ferulic was recommended to me by a friend of mine who is an aesthetician. She said I could order it on Amazon and I&#x27;m glad I did! This stuff works great and makes my skin look more youthful. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought this SkinCeuticals CE Ferulic PRO 55ml / 1.9oz for the first time in 2009 and it worked wonders on my face, and I have been using it since then but the nice and noticeable results stopped in 2011 and I decided not to purchase this product anymore, and also it&#x27;s very expensive.</li>
    <li> This product is not the same serum I bought from OTA merchandise July 25,2012.  I have used this wonderful serum for 7 -8 years, and I am offended that this company does not think I recognize the difference in the smell,texture and color.  I realize that color and thickness does change as it ages.  I have no desire to just &amp;#34;be complaining&amp;#34;.  I just wanted to be able to begin using a quality product .  So now I need to go buy it at a spa.  I am not happy.</li>
    <li> I have used the CE Ferulic along with the B5 Hydrating Gel and love them.  I would strongly recommend them to anyone, regardless of age.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my Dermotologist.......use every evening.......my skin looks great.....asked often what I use on my skin.  I always purchase this size and look for vendor offering best price/free shipping.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a few years, as recommended by my dermatologist.This is the first time I&#x27;ve bought the PRO size. The one thing I don&#x27;t like is that it came without a security seal around the dropper/opening - something that seems to come with practically everything we buy these days.</li>
    <li> Have used for year on the advice of my dermatologist.</li>
