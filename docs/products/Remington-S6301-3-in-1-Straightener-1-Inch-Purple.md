### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This multitasking styling tool is great!</li>
      <li>But, this one will be perfect for my travel bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>she kept extolling it - lol!</li>
      <li>really impressed with this unit.</li>
      <li>I will fully admit that I&#x27;m not the best hair styler in the world, so any time I see a product that claims to make it easier to style hair</li>
      <li>I thought this three-in-one would be an ideal product for my situation.</li>
      <li>I got this hoping for the &amp;#34;beach look,&amp;#34; and thought it would be a great travel appliance.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a great straightener.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is great advertising.  </li>
      <li>As a straightener it works great, as a curler?</li>
      <li>in all, this is a great concept but not so great execution.</li>
      <li>With three girls in the household we love a great styling device - and this is GREAT!</li>
      <li>The straightener is the best of the three functions and by far the best inexpensive straightener I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
      <li>This is a good straightener.  </li>
      <li>As good as anything we&#x27;ve got from a salon.</li>
      <li>I bought this to replace my beloved straightener that was caught in the drawer and pulled apart.  </li>
      <li>So we&#x27;re good with the straightening</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a nice try</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a nice try</li>
      <li>The curling brush gave me a nice wave... but not a curl.  </li>
      <li>The straightener works well, but lets be honest - how would it not work?</li>
      <li>The plates slide on and off very easy.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it works better if you are doing someone else&#x27;s hair but trying to do my own hair with it</li>
      <li>I have very fine, wavy hair.  </li>
      <li>Probably best for shoulder length or shorter hair, the plates are not very wide.</li>
      <li>This is an OK product, it doesn&#x27;t work miracles but It will straighten or wave your hair.  </li>
      <li>The oval shape seems to provide more control, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love that it has a lock so that you can lock it and put it in the drawer.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This wasn&#x27;t the straightener for me but what I was able to do, I was able to check and the product seemed to be heated sufficiently and working correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>curling sleeve was interesting.  </li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t love this</li>
      <li>anyone can get this product and figure out how to keep the attachments attached, more power to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>more body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It was just ok.  </li>
      <li>I think this sleeve would work better on shorter hair, but it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to get this to do that</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t love this</li>
      <li>I have zero desire for stick-straight hair, but I&#x27;d love some of the smoothness that goes with that, but in my experience, once you use a straightener, that&#x27;s IT.</li>
      <li>was very excited to use this</li>
      <li>the brush ends allow her to put in curls at the end of her hair for her own unique twits, no pun intended.  </li>
      <li>The flat iron function worked the best of the three options.</li>
      <li>So far it has done a great job with straightening.  </li>
      <li>and it wasn&#x27;t easy to untangle.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The curling element was easy to swap into the unit.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s pretty good at two goals (straighten and curl) and not bad on the third.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I liked them very much.</li>
      <li>/&gt;In practice, I don&#x27;t need a curling iron, but it worked fine.  </li>
      <li>And I&#x27;m a huge fan of ceramic irons for the way my hair reacts to them</li>
      <li>Also, when I use the straightener, it doesn&#x27;t glide over my hair as smoothly as I&#x27;d expect.</li>
      <li>Still, I give it four stars for working great at its basic function.</li>
      <li>As a traditional straightener, this is great.</li>
      <li>Overall I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
      <li>I got a really good result with shine and nice smoothness down to the ends.</li>
      <li>This is a nice high quality multi-function hair straightener.  </li>
      <li>I was excited to get this product to try since I use heat on my hair often.</li>
      <li>I think people with longer hair will absolutely love this product, but it does pretty well with shorter hair.</li>
      <li>I do not have fine hair, but I would have to over load the device in order for his to hold my hair, but then would not be able to heat or style my hair because there was too much in the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>In truth, this is the part I was most excited for but just really don&#x27;t mesh with it.</li>
      <li>(it&#x27;s fairly straight as it is), but also that I&#x27;d be able to utilize the curling capabilities of the product.</li>
      <li>The straight iron made my hair nice and straight.  </li>
      <li>It heats up quick and straightener hair</li>
      <li>/&gt;In terms of practicalities, the straightener heated up quickly, within the promised 30 seconds, and the pivoting cord is also useful.</li>
      <li>If it allowed me to not need a curling iron and a flat iron separately when I travel, it&#x27;d be great, even if the result wasn&#x27;t quite as great as my more expensive irons, but it just doesn&#x27;t work well at all across the board.</li>
      <li>I was able to straighten my hair and get volume with the volume attachment, with a bit of soft curl at the front to finish it</li>
      <li>The straightener is useful and it works the way it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
      <li>My neighbor&#x27;s 13 year old daughter, who is very proficient at hair, was here and between us neither of us could figure out how to get nice, reliable curls every time.</li>
      <li>It heats up quickly but not overly hot to damage hair.  </li>
      <li>I have been fine using the high setting.</li>
      <li>highest level of heat is very hot - maybe too hot for children and teens.</li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t see an advantage of this product over any other good straightener.</li>
      <li>this is because this means I can keep the iron in my right hand to work on both sides of my head.  </li>
      <li>Straighten, curl, and add volume, right?</li>
      <li>It is comfortable in the hand and easy enough to use.</li>
      <li>I love the different attachments, but it works better on just the straightening issue rather than the soft curls as promised.  </li>
      <li>Background: we have very curly/ wavy on two of us and one of us has straight fine</li>
      <li>This condition I suffer is exactly why I go to my hairdresser with all the modesty and petitioning penitence</li>
      <li>had hoped that I would not only be able to straighten my hair</li>
      <li>So I switched to the second attachment which is supposed to give a person&#x27;s hair more volume.  </li>
      <li>One for straightening, one for loose/smaller curls, and the third to add more volumnizing waves to your hair.  </li>
      <li>I was interested in the straightening and volumizing abilities.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m interested.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the straightening sleeve first</li>
      <li>This tool is one of many in which I hand her with supplication the same way an accountant takes my taxes.  </li>
      <li>but this 3 in 1 hair straightener is a first for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>would definitely recommend this straightener; I think it&#x27;s the easiest I&#x27;ve ever used and gets my hair to look more attractive in less time than my old one.</li>
      <li>This time she was done in less than an hour (400 degree heat) and the hair was super smooth - so smooth</li>
      <li>This product did work somewhat well, and allowed me to make a curl which I haven&#x27;t really been able to do with a regular straightener.</li>
      <li>Gets hot real quick...in and out in minutes</li>
      <li>and it did a good job, like a standard flat iron.</li>
      <li>More than likely I will use this primarily as a backup flat</li>
      <li>More than likely I will use this primarily as a backup flat</li>
      <li>While the plates were much smaller than most flat irons, and not as smooth, it still did an admirable job of straightening my humidity stricken frizz.</li>
      <li>tried this for a whole month before storing it away.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use a straightener very often, but I do like this one.  </li>
      <li>The one thing I really appreciate about this styler is the swivel movement of the of the power cord.</li>
      <li>/&gt;+Extremely fast heat up on the ceramic plates</li>
      <li>Not as much as I wanted, but then, I&#x27;ve never got any volume at all on straightened hair.</li>
      <li>And I can tell you from her that she absolutely loves this device... as a straightener.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking to try some curve to the ends (not curl, per se, just some movement to break up all the straight lines.)</li>
      <li>Not so much.</li>

    <li> I don&#x27;t use a straightener very often, but I do like this one.  It is versatile and has not burned my hair.  It is comfortable in the hand and easy enough to use.</li>
    <li> The Remington 3 in 1 straighter comes with 3 options, straighter, loose curls and volume.  You can achieve these different looks with 3 interchange attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is longer in the front but very short in the back, which can make it annoying to straighten as it can slip out of the straightener easily. The oval shape of this one worked much better to hold the hair in place, while I can use the other attachments towards the front of my hair. I liked them very much. I was able to straighten my hair and get volume with the volume attachment, with a bit of soft curl at the front to finish it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of practicalities, the straightener heated up quickly, within the promised 30 seconds, and the pivoting cord is also useful. I only needed to run it over my hair once to get the desired results. The oval shape seems to provide more control, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this straightener; I think it&#x27;s the easiest I&#x27;ve ever used and gets my hair to look more attractive in less time than my old one.</li>
    <li> I will fully admit that I&#x27;m not the best hair styler in the world, so any time I see a product that claims to make it easier to style hair I&#x27;m interested. This straightener/curler, however, did not live up to my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had hoped that I would not only be able to straighten my hair (it&#x27;s fairly straight as it is), but also that I&#x27;d be able to utilize the curling capabilities of the product. Unfortunately, I wasn&#x27;t. There are no clear instructions on the tool that give you a good idea of how to curl, but I even went online to look at videos to see what I was doing wrong, only to be left curl-less. My neighbor&#x27;s 13 year old daughter, who is very proficient at hair, was here and between us neither of us could figure out how to get nice, reliable curls every time. As a straightener it works great, as a curler? Not so much.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this, particularly for travel, but unfortunately am kind of disappointed in it. For one thing, the first few times I used it, it has a chemically type smell to it and while I expect this to go away, it&#x27;s definitely a turn off. Also, when I use the straightener, it doesn&#x27;t glide over my hair as smoothly as I&#x27;d expect. There&#x27;s a rough feeling to it, like the plates are having a hard time moving over my hair. I regularly use a Chi, and never have this same experience. That aside, however, the straightener does work, though it doesn&#x27;t take out some of the frizz and help my hair lay flatter in the same way my Chi does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the curling attachment, I had a really hard time getting the technique it instructs for this to work. In truth, this is the part I was most excited for but just really don&#x27;t mesh with it. A regularly curling iron seems far more reliable than this. The volumizing attachment didn&#x27;t really seem to make much difference for me, though my hair tends to be curly and frizzy on its own and is so thick, volumizing stuff isn&#x27;t always the way to go for me. That being said, I just didn&#x27;t see much of a difference when I used this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a great concept but not so great execution. If it allowed me to not need a curling iron and a flat iron separately when I travel, it&#x27;d be great, even if the result wasn&#x27;t quite as great as my more expensive irons, but it just doesn&#x27;t work well at all across the board.</li>
    <li> This is a nice high quality multi-function hair straightener.  What can I say, it heats up fast, is durable and just sits close to the sink for my daughters to use.</li>
    <li> With three girls in the household we love a great styling device - and this is GREAT! Background: we have very curly/ wavy on two of us and one of us has straight fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;+Extremely fast heat up on the ceramic plates&lt;br /&gt;+Love the additional attachements for different styles&lt;br /&gt;+Cord swivels so it wont get twisted (our old ones are a mess!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SORTA CON:&lt;br /&gt;-The highest level of heat is very hot - maybe too hot for children and teens. At this level I think it may singe or burn their hair. Keep the heat down, in my opinion, for kids. Adult&#x27;s hair is tougher and should be find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great straightener. As good as anything we&#x27;ve got from a salon. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This product did work somewhat well, and allowed me to make a curl which I haven&#x27;t really been able to do with a regular straightener. It only has two heat settings, though, hot and scorching hot, so if you have fine hair you may fry it if you&#x27;re not careful.  I did fry the ends of mine a little bit.</li>
    <li> As a traditional straightener, this is great. So I gave it four stars. As a curler or volumizer with the attachments, it&#x27;s useless on my hair. I put on the optional attachments but it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough on them to do a thing to my hair. It doesn&#x27;t curl at all. However, as a regular straightener, I like it a lot. It has two heat settings, and a decent amount of surface area. The cord is much shorter than a more expensive one I reviewed, which I use daily. But, this one will be perfect for my travel bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In theory, the idea was neat. One appliance with multiple uses. In practice, it just didn&#x27;t cut it for me. Still, I give it four stars for working great at its basic function.</li>
    <li> Yeah, well this is a straightener that also curls and also waves. In this case, I think they tried just a little too hard. The straightener is useful and it works the way it&#x27;s supposed to. But the curling feature, meh. And the waving thing, bleh. The fact that two out of the three features don&#x27;t work so well makes this and overpriced straightener.</li>
    <li> Super disappointing!  The straightener works well, but lets be honest - how would it not work? The curling iron sleeves are worthless, no matter what I tried curls were just not happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t do it.</li>
    <li> I will admit it, I am all thumbs when it comes to curling irons or straighter hair tools of all kinds.  Please keep that in mind with my  review, but as this had a brush attachment, I thought it may be easier to deal with.  It was just ok.  I love the different attachments, but it works better on just the straightening issue rather than the soft curls as promised.  I have extremely naturally curly hair, the kind that you don&#x27;t want to get rid of the curls, just tone them down a bit and make them softer.  I struggled with that, but then I think any other person with non arthritic fingers that feel like ten thumbs will do fine.  This condition I suffer is exactly why I go to my hairdresser with all the modesty and petitioning penitence I can muster.  This tool is one of many in which I hand her with supplication the same way an accountant takes my taxes.  Thank you oh wielder of  the odd heat tools that end up burning my body if I get within three feet of them.  You will always get a tip.</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this product to try since I use heat on my hair often. I blow dry straight, once per week and maintain my style with a large curling iron. I thought this would be an easier way to keep my style sleek in between washes. It just doesn&#x27;t perform well, at all. The plates change easily enough but you can only change it if the iron is cool so no switching plates till you shut off the iron and let it cool down. The straightener works well enough but I had a hard time getting the nice upward swing curl I usually achieve on my ends. The plates didn&#x27;t grip my hair unless I contorted my wrist into the most uncomfortable position and the instability made me cautious of burning myself. It also does not come with any way to store the extra plates so the chances of losing them are high. I have mine in a Ziploc but I probably won&#x27;t use this machine unless my tried and true tool breaks down.</li>
    <li> Now, being a short-haired male, I don&#x27;t have much use for a straightener, but my wife does since her hair can get all sorts of crazy wavy from time to time. And I can tell you from her that she absolutely loves this device... as a straightener. However, like many of the other reviews here, the other options of this 3-in-1 Straightener are not really useful. It did give it a slight amount of volume using that option, but trying out the loose curl option gave her nothing but problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as she&#x27;s concerned, she absolutely loves the straightening aspects, but the others... not so much.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this, I really did.  The Remington 3 in 1 Straightener just was a pain in the butt to use.  It is a ceramic straightener that has two lockable and interchangeable clips that style your hair in soft curls and in straight waves that magnify and give your hair more body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great advertising.  However, it took me more than five minutes to figure out how to interchange the different clips so that I could change the way I fixed my hair.  When I finally figured out what to do, I started with the brush attachment.  I could never figure out how to keep it hooked onto the straightener and every single time I tried to curl my hair it fell off.  So I switched to the second attachment which is supposed to give a person&#x27;s hair more volume.  It too was hard to attach and keep attached until I gave up trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wasn&#x27;t the straightener for me but what I was able to do, I was able to check and the product seemed to be heated sufficiently and working correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone can get this product and figure out how to keep the attachments attached, more power to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natalie S. for Amazon Vine</li>
    <li> I found this difficult to use on all levels.  I don&#x27;t know if it works better if you are doing someone else&#x27;s hair but trying to do my own hair with it was cumbersome</li>
    <li> If there isn&#x27;t, the Remington Ultimate Stylist comes pretty freaking close!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what it is, but my hair&#x27;s texture seems to be changing as I age (gag.) It&#x27;s not easily smooth like it used to be. I have zero desire for stick-straight hair, but I&#x27;d love some of the smoothness that goes with that, but in my experience, once you use a straightener, that&#x27;s IT. Curl and volume are out until you wash your hair again and start from scratch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product claims to do all three, and I was a tad skeptical. Once my hair was dry, I plugged in the styler - it heated up fast, and &#x27;heat&#x27; is no exaggeration. This thing means business! It worked fine as a straightener; within a few minutes I slipped on the volumizer and it managed to give some volume to the areas that had just been straightened. Not as much as I wanted, but then, I&#x27;ve never got any volume at all on straightened hair. Volume and shine with the same styling tool - that really is a first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking to try some curve to the ends (not curl, per se, just some movement to break up all the straight lines.) The curling element was easy to swap into the unit. This was perhaps the easiest thing to use; a few seconds on each hair section and my hair was swinging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really impressed with this unit. It&#x27;s not perfect (a little TOO hot; the straightener isn&#x27;t my favorite tool), but it really does manage to perform all three tasks - straighten, volumize and curl - and it&#x27;s pretty good at two goals (straighten and curl) and not bad on the third.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> I got this hoping for the &amp;#34;beach look,&amp;#34; and thought it would be a great travel appliance. Unfortunately I did not find this user-friendly.  The attachment is on one side only and you have to hold the device in a certain direction and turn in a certain direction in order to attempt the curl or look you are aiming for.  Also, sometimes the curl worked, and sometimes it doesn&#x27;t for whatever reason.  Then there is the fact that it does not hold hair, regardless of how hard I grip the handles.  I do not have fine hair, but I would have to over load the device in order for his to hold my hair, but then would not be able to heat or style my hair because there was too much in the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this for a whole month before storing it away.</li>
    <li> I have chin-length hair that is very thick and wild. This product works quite well, even though my hair is very stubborn. I like that I can lock the handles and use the brush side to give my hair some volume, too. I think people with longer hair will absolutely love this product, but it does pretty well with shorter hair. I do wish that there was a stand of some type for when you have to put it down, but I set it down on the plastic brish bristles. All in all, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> Two out of three work well.  The straightener is the best of the three functions and by far the best inexpensive straightener I&#x27;ve ever used.  The Curling feature is still something I&#x27;m trying to figure out but seems that it works, I just need more practice(would be easier if I had longer hair) and the Volume feature is pretty much useless.  I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to know if its going to stand the test of time, but even if it doesn&#x27;t this would be a great back up/travel iron to keep around.</li>
    <li> I like this straightener.  I have very fine, wavy hair.  The curling brush gave me a nice wave... but not a curl.  The straight iron made my hair nice and straight.  The plates heated up evenly.  Overall I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I have countless of hair staying tools but this 3 in 1 hair straightener is a first for me.&lt;br /&gt;I was very excited to use this that I didn&#x27;t know which plate to start off with first because I wanted to test each one on a different section of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with 3 interchangeable plates for straightening, curling and volume. The plates slide on and off very easy. No difficulty there. The straightening plate worked just like normal if you was flat ironing your hair, the curling plate did nothing for me since I never curl my hair using a flat iron any way, The volumizing plate was the most difficult to use because I just couldn&#x27;t get my hand coordination right, you have to basically close the entire flat iron and run it under your hair making sure everything is centered in between the bristles. Doing this takes a lot of time because to get the look you want using the volume plate, you will have to work in very small sections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I like the concept of this, but to keep it all the way real this is not geared towards ethnic hair and we will get totally different results if any at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of this. It&#x27;s a multitasker and therefore it saves me having three devices in my bathroom closet. I&#x27;m a fan of the volume-enhancing attachment for those &amp;#34;flat-hair days&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s least successful as a curling iron, just because the shape feels off for doing tight curls.</li>
    <li> I chose this product in hopes of not having to travel with both a flat iron and a curling iron when I travel. It also has an inviting price point. Unfortunately, while it is lightweight and reasonably compact, it doesn&#x27;t do either function nearly as well as the original tools I was looking to replace. The flat iron function worked the best of the three options. While the plates were much smaller than most flat irons, and not as smooth, it still did an admirable job of straightening my humidity stricken frizz. The curling sleeve didn&#x27;t do very much, but it did work better than simply using a regular flat iron to try to create a curl. The volumizing sleeve didn&#x27;t seem to do much at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complaint, however, was a lack of instructions on how to use the product. All I received was basic instructions to plug the product in and directions to go online and watch videos to learn how to use the iron.</li>
    <li> Gets hot real quick...in and out in minutes</li>
    <li> Wife hated this product.  The opposite heating surfaces couldn&#x27;t get close enough to apply proper pressure and heat to the hair, making it effectively useless.</li>
    <li> got this for my wife and she loves it.  it has replaced the old GE straightener that she has used for the past couple of years.  It heats up quickly but not overly hot to damage hair.  It&#x27;s wide application area helps to get her very long hair done quickly.  the brush ends allow her to put in curls at the end of her hair for her own unique twits, no pun intended.  The unit comes with three separate attachments.  One for straightening, one for loose/smaller curls, and the third to add more volumnizing waves to your hair.  Wow this is made by Remington?</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping to replace all three tools. So far it has done a great job with straightening.  The curling option is kind of awkward at first, but once you get the hang of it, it goes quicker.  I love that it has a lock so that you can lock it and put it in the drawer. I bought this to replace my beloved straightener that was caught in the drawer and pulled apart.  This is an OK product, it doesn&#x27;t work miracles but It will straighten or wave your hair.  Probably best for shoulder length or shorter hair, the plates are not very wide.</li>
    <li> New product released March 2014. Brought it to my hair stylist still in the box, to get her review. I have neck length, thick, curly, color treated, 50 year old, Irish hair. To wash, blow dry &amp; flat iron my hair usually takes her 1 hour 15 minutes. This time she was done in less than an hour (400 degree heat) and the hair was super smooth - so smooth she kept extolling it - lol! There was No chemical type smell to it (as I read in another review). I have been using the Straightener every other day (at home) for the past 30 days, it makes a joke of my ancient straightener (so that is going in the garage sale box!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI - 3 settings - HIGH heat: LOWER heat; OFF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t use the volume or curl attachments. My sisters will be visiting and both have different hair types, both I know will use the curling iron attachment and I think both will try out the volume attachment so will update this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The auto off after 60 minutes is a winner - never have to worry \\&quot;did I turn it off?\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The swivel cord made it SO much easier to style the back of my hair (kept the cord from getting tangled) and my hair dresser thought it was cool too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I searched the internet for a video from Remington showing the product in action but came up empty.</li>
    <li> This multitasking styling tool is great! I have essentially switched from using a brush plus blow dryer plus a straightener, to this, and doing so has cut my hair styling time significantly. I just keep the brush adapter on without locking it closed, which allows me to quickly go from adding volume to my roots to straightening/styling the rest of my strands. I like how it is light-weight and smaller than all of my other curling irons and flat irons. The small size is very comfortable for my small hands, and doesn&#x27;t take up much room on my counter. I tried using the curling adapter once, but I needed a tighter curl so had to use another curling iron (1 inch barrel). There are only 2 heat settings so there is little fuss, but not much fine control if that is what you need. I have been fine using the high setting. I would recommend this for anyone whose likes an efficient, everyday styling tool.</li>
    <li> My fine hair is hard to style and doesn&#x27;t curl easily or hold curl for long. On the other hand, it also has a lot of natural curl in the under layers that I like to straighten. I thought this three-in-one would be an ideal product for my situation. Straighten, curl, and add volume, right? But I found it awkward to use, the the results were not impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attachment for \\&quot;loose curls\\&quot; didn&#x27;t provide any curl to speak of for my fine hair. The volume attachment was just too uncomfortable to work with, and did not \\&quot;volumize\\&quot; my hair, which is always desperately in need of volume. The straightening feature works fine, but no better than any other straightener/flat iron, so I can&#x27;t see an advantage of this product over any other good straightener.</li>
    <li> The Remington curling iron claims to straighten, curl, and add volume.  The pros are the ceramic plates, it fits well in my hand, and you have, theoretically, one tool instead of three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In practice, I don&#x27;t need a curling iron, but it worked fine.  I was interested in the straightening and volumizing abilities.  It didn&#x27;t seem to straighten any better or worse than other irons I&#x27;ve used.  I noticed no difference at all with the volumizing.  None, and that was a disappointment because that&#x27;s what I need the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in the end, it&#x27;s nothing special, but I&#x27;ve seen worse.</li>
    <li> My hair is very long and looks very thick, although I really have fine hair - just a lot of it. I have learned how to manage my hair with a flat iron but curling, that&#x27;s another story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This three in one styler by Remington worked on my hair for the most part, probably due to the thickness and texture of my hair.  And I&#x27;m a huge fan of ceramic irons for the way my hair reacts to them so that&#x27;s a plus. The one thing I really appreciate about this styler is the swivel movement of the of the power cord. I can&#x27;t begin to describe what a big deal this is because this means I can keep the iron in my right hand to work on both sides of my head.  I don&#x27;t have to switch and use my awkward left hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remington calls the attachments on this styler \\&quot;sleeves.\\&quot; The sleeves interchange: one for flat ironing, one for curling, and a brush for creating volume. The sleeves lock to the iron and heat up quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the straightening sleeve first and it did a good job, like a standard flat iron. I got a really good result with shine and nice smoothness down to the ends. I have very long hair so the fact that there&#x27;s the swivel on the cord and the device is light, the process went quicker than I expected. So we&#x27;re good with the straightening function.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curling sleeve was interesting.  I try to do those long tube curls but it never comes out the way I imagine it.  I wasn&#x27;t able to get this to do that either (I think only a wand curler works on me) but it did give a decent flip to the ends. I think this sleeve would work better on shorter hair, but it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The volumizing brush sleeve accomplished nothing. Nothing at all. I tried to give myself a little bit of lift towards the back of my head but nothing happened, volumewise. I did get tangled though and it wasn&#x27;t easy to untangle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, two of the three components of this worked well. That said, I really think it&#x27;s better to use a device specific to a process, curling iron for curls, wand for tube curls, flat iron for smoothness, and a big round brush to create volume while actually blow drying wet hair or it will fall flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t love this but I did like it, minus the brush sleeve.  More than likely I will use this primarily as a backup flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice try but it&#x27;s not at 100% yet.ling iron for curls, wand for tube curls, flat iron for smoothness, and a big round brush to create volume while actually blow drying wet hair or it will fall flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t love this but I did like it, minus the brush sleeve.

    <li> This is a good straightener.  It heats up quick and straightener hair well. It is a little too small for me I would have rather had a bigger end piece. The volume it talks about is really hard to produce. It just doesn&#x27;t do what it says on the box.</li>
