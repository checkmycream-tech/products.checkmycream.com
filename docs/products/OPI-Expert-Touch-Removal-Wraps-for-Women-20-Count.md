      <li>Love the wraps.</li>
      <li>I was expecting to be able to get the gel polish off without having to go to the nail salon.</li>

      <li>How can so many reviewers claim that it removes gel polish and acrylic nails????&lt;br</li>
      <li>These are mighty convenient in lieu of making my own with foil and cotton balls.  </li>
      <li>These don&#x27;t work any better than that and cost much more.  </li>
      <li>very quickly and easily.</li>
      <li>easy to soak off gel polish in 15 minutes.</li>
      <li>I could easily put these on with my non dominant hand.</li>
      <li>Makes removing gel polish easy.  </li>
      <li>I bought these to remove that stubborn glitter polish and these were so easy to use just soak them in polish remover and wrap them around your fingers over the nail .I</li>

      <li>I love gel polish, which is a true miracle product and this makes removal a snap.</li>
      <li>These are what they use in the salon but for a much cheaper price now I can do in my own home.</li>
      <li>I got this package since it was cheaper, but was a good name, I really like opi products, had decent reviews, and I had not yet tried foil remover wraps, so I wanted to try it out, so I didn&#x27;t need many to just give it a try.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon Prime!!!</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re very easy to use and very convenient</li>
      <li>I highly recommend these if you&#x27;re planning on doing your own non-chip manicure.</li>
      <li>Foil is much more manageable than the gelish foil wraps, especially when doing your own nails.</li>
      <li>Most of it is off by itself - the rest comes off easily with a soft orange</li>
      <li>Same exact thing, much more cost effective.</li>
      <li>thsi really works and takes off gel polish quick and easy.</li>
      <li>I just brush off any loose shellac and add a little more acetone - works great!</li>
      <li>These shipped really quickly and that is greatly appreciated!</li>
      <li>came right off</li>
      <li>I wrap each nail - sit for about 10-15 minutes and the shellac comes right off.  </li>
      <li>very helpful and quick</li>
      <li>I wanted to make sure the pad had enough on it to soak.</li>
      <li>so I went back and ordered 5 more packs of 20 just to have them on hand.</li>
      <li>I was able to do it on all 8 fingers, but then I would need assistance from my husband with the last two fingers.</li>
      <li>first I used 10 for each removal - i.e. one for each finger.  </li>
      <li>It was easy for me to apply the foil and cotton on my left hand, but then it became a little bit challenging to apply them on my right hand.</li>
      <li>The foil seems to really help the process and prevent the acetone/remover from drying up.  </li>
      <li>just take everything off, don&#x27;t DRILL anything, don&#x27;t PULL anything, just be gentle.</li>
      <li>These wraps make polish removal so much easier.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use it as much</li>
      <li>Much easier than soaking your nails.</li>
      <li>These really work.  </li>
      <li>and this stainless steel pump ( [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>I can get the same result with a cotton ball and fiol, but these were far easier to put on and stayed on so much better.</li>
      <li>MOST of the gel polish could then be scraped off with an orange stick, but not all - and certainly not the acrylic stuff underneath.</li>
      <li>I use just a smidge of pure acetone on each pad, then wrap each nail and put rubber gloves on, 15 minutes later the polish rubs right off!</li>
      <li>B004O6NEEU Menda High Density Polyethylene ESD Dissipative Dispensing Bottle with Stainless Steel One-Touch Pump]] ) to dispense the remover.</li>
      <li>I used them on my right hand first and then reused them on my left!</li>
      <li>Minimal scraping, and so easy to put on.</li>
      <li>researched how to remove gel polish and acrylic nails, ordered Expert Touch Removal Wraps and Opi Expert Touch Lacquer Remover 4 oz from Amazon, and thought I would get this done quickly and without further harm to my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>left them on for about 5 to ten minutes and couldn&#x27;t believe how the glitter just came off so much better than cotton rounds</li>
      <li>Simple, quick and cost-effective.  </li>
      <li>NOTE, she did have to use the drill GENTLY to get off the remaining gel polish which hadn&#x27;t come off but was very near the edge of my nails.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have tried all different wrapping sequences and prefer to wrap it on the front and back first and then secure the sides by folding the ends up on top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Easy to use and definitely worth the small investment</li>
      <li>The time it took to loosen and remove the gel was reduced by about 30% from my previous method and it removed more completely.</li>
      <li>Additionally - I was able to use the same 5 wraps on both hands; I simply poured a little bit more of the acetone on the pad (with the foil still in the shape of my fingertips) and stuck them back on.  </li>
      <li>This product is good, and certainly does the job, but it&#x27;s far too expensive for what it is.</li>
      <li>But since I do one hand at a time, I have found I can reuse the first set for the second hand.  </li>
      <li>i got this small packege just to try them, and i love them</li>
      <li>So much easier than trying to make your own cotton ball/foil removers and less messy.</li>
      <li>and they actually surprised me.</li>
      <li>get it removed professionally cost me $10 plus $1 tip.</li>
      <li>The original reason I got the gel nails was because my nail had cracked all the way down past the white of the nail top</li>
      <li>they are helpful, you don&#x27;t have to do the cotton and tape thing, or keep your nails soaking for a long period of time, so I really do llike that,</li>
      <li>This great little wrapper does help when removing that tough gel polish.</li>
      <li>The trick is to leave them on for at least 15 minutes, and then the polish comes off easily.</li>
      <li>These are effective but are difficult to apply by yourself.  </li>
      <li>After an hour of soaking in acetone warmed by warm water, and her alternately taking out one hand and gently using an emery board to get gently file off the acrylic crap - she had to do this multiple times because once the fingernail comes out of the acetone,</li>
      <li>It is overall too large; I have been cutting the pad/foil in half length wise and folding in the ends a bit before starting.</li>
      <li>(I wasn&#x27;t aware that it would be shipped from overseas at the time I ordered it, should have checked), however, I order stuff on here quit often, and receive items from overseas often as well, and this took about 3 times as long as all the other items I ordered from overseas, during the same time period, to arrive!</li>

    <li> A great way to remove gel manicures without taring up your nails! Easy to use and definitely worth the small investment &#x3D;)!</li>
    <li> thsi really works and takes off gel polish quick and easy. i would buy this again to take off gel nail polish.  very helpful and quick</li>
    <li> It is overall too large; I have been cutting the pad/foil in half length wise and folding in the ends a bit before starting.</li>
    <li> Product just as advertised. I don&#x27;t use it as much but it works good. I use it with 100% acetone.</li>
    <li> These work well and are far less messy than cotton balls and foil. I still don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re the perfect solution (this probably does not exist) but they&#x27;ll do!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the way my salon removes my shellac polish - soaking in a bowl and then grinding off - so i got these.  These work so well.  I do one hand at a time; I have a pump dispenser for the acetone.  I wrap each nail - sit for about 10-15 minutes and the shellac comes right off.  Most of it is off by itself - the rest comes off easily with a soft orange stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I used 10 for each removal - i.e. one for each finger.  But since I do one hand at a time, I have found I can reuse the first set for the second hand.  I just brush off any loose shellac and add a little more acetone - works great!</li>
    <li> These are great I bought these to remove that stubborn glitter polish and these were so easy to use just soak them in polish remover and wrap them around your fingers over the nail .I left them on for about 5 to ten minutes and couldn&#x27;t believe how the glitter just came off so much better than cotton rounds .you could make them yourself using cotton than cutting your own foil if you wanted but to me these just seem like the easiest solution to removing glitter I would buy these again without any hesitation</li>
    <li> This product did not work at all.  Don&#x27;t waste your time purchasing this.  I was expecting to be able to get the gel polish off without having to go to the nail salon.</li>
    <li> These were terrific.  I soaked off my gel manicure in less time (and with less mess) than I normally would have used if I was sticking my fingers in the acetone.  Additionally - I was able to use the same 5 wraps on both hands; I simply poured a little bit more of the acetone on the pad (with the foil still in the shape of my fingertips) and stuck them back on.  Simple, quick and cost-effective.  I&#x27;m sold!!</li>
    <li> Makes removing gel polish easy.  Wraps easily around the fingers and stays in place.  Much easier than soaking your nails.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work well. The polish remover was leaking out. I wanted to make sure the pad had enough on it to soak. Kept on falling off my fingers even though I pressed hard to mold the foil. Overall bulky. I will try the gauze wrap around one&#x27;s next.</li>
    <li> Easy &amp; Convienent.  These are good quality and sane ones my salon uses.  Forget cutting up foil price is worth my time.</li>
    <li> Who ever thought of this idea came up with something to talk about! This great little wrapper does help when removing that tough gel polish. Recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> i got this small packege just to try them, and i love them so now i need a bigger package</li>
    <li> Product delivered as promised.  Same product used by my technician.  Performed just as it does in the spa.  I use these when I can&#x27;t find time to get to the nail salon and I&#x27;m beyond my two weeks for the no chip polish manicure and desperately need to it removed.  Great buy!</li>
    <li> I have been using gel polish for a few months, but went to a new salon. After, I was desperate after a week of pain from a nail salon that drilled the top of my nails and then added a tip overlay, covered it with acrylic (pink and white powder and chemical) and topped it all off with gel polish. It was thick, and it was painful. I just wanted them off. I didn&#x27;t want to deal with the salon, but in the end, that&#x27;s where I should have gone. Instead, I bought these foil wrappers, extra strength lacquer polish remover, and they did very little! How can so many reviewers claim that it removes gel polish and acrylic nails????&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I researched how to remove gel polish and acrylic nails, ordered Expert Touch Removal Wraps and Opi Expert Touch Lacquer Remover 4 oz from Amazon, and thought I would get this done quickly and without further harm to my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last night, I wrapped my nails in Extra strength lacquer polish remover with cotton soaked in the remover and then the foil wrap pads for an hour. MOST of the gel polish could then be scraped off with an orange stick, but not all - and certainly not the acrylic stuff underneath. By doing internet research, I understand this is called solar nails or pink and white powder. This has to be the worst stuff for your hands!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, I tried another hour with remover and foil wrap pads but only managed to soften one big nail and get part of the fake stuff off. By then my hands felt so damaged. So I went to a nearby salon  and asked - just take everything off, don&#x27;t DRILL anything, don&#x27;t PULL anything, just be gentle. After an hour of soaking in acetone warmed by warm water, and her alternately taking out one hand and gently using an emery board to get gently file off the acrylic crap - she had to do this multiple times because once the fingernail comes out of the acetone, whatever is on it begins hardening again and the nails had to go back in the acetone. Finally, it was all off and she put on the cuticleoil. The salon had a lady who could understand and speak English and she did the removal. She said, don&#x27;t do anything to your nails for a month, they are very very weak now. NOTE, she did have to use the drill GENTLY to get off the remaining gel polish which hadn&#x27;t come off but was very near the edge of my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the 2 hrs at home with nail polish remover and 1 hr at the salon with acetone, my hands and nails were very very dry. I came home and put olive oil on them but still the nails themselves feel dry. That&#x27;s better than having them turn to mush if I had left that acrylic crap on any longer than a week.  The original reason I got the gel nails was because my nail had cracked all the way down past the white of the nail top and I was in severe pain. I met a cosmetologist who said don&#x27;t use artificial nails NOTHING. She recommended a fiber nail polish and hardener, and even with that, to remove it every 2 weeks so my nails can breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get it removed professionally cost me $10 plus $1 tip. I paid $3.24 for the Expert Touch Removal Wraps and $5.86 for the Opi Expert Touch Lacquer Remover 4 oz.  The salon was the better value! Sometimes you just can&#x27;t do it yourself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want nail salons to have people who speak and understand English, and who do what the client asked. All I asked was for overlay tips and gel polish - not this solar nail crap!</li>
    <li> Worked perfectly! I could easily put these on with my non dominant hand. It took about 10 mins of soak with the OPI expert touch lacquer remover and the gel nails came right off</li>
    <li> Love the wraps. The only improvement I would make, would be to move the cotton pad over a bit so it isn&#x27;t centered in the foil. This would make it even easier to wrap. The foil is very easy to work with and fold over.</li>
    <li> just cut tin foil and wet a cotton ball with nail polish remover.  These don&#x27;t work any better than that and cost much more.  The wraps that Velcro on are much better</li>
    <li> Love em. They are def easier than soaking your fingertips which was the method I used before. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I thought these worked very well and were great to use to remove my gel nail polish. I can get the same result with a cotton ball and fiol, but these were far easier to put on and stayed on so much better.</li>
    <li> These wraps make polish removal so much easier. I tried to make them myself, but the removal wraps are easier.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend these if you&#x27;re planning on doing your own non-chip manicure. I used to dip my nails in a bowl of acetone and felt like I was wasting a lot of my acetone. I also used to cut foil into squares and would put a small piece of acetone soaked cotton on my nails for ten minutes. It was easy for me to apply the foil and cotton on my left hand, but then it became a little bit challenging to apply them on my right hand. I was able to do it on all 8 fingers, but then I would need assistance from my husband with the last two fingers. Both methods worked well at removing my gel nail polish, but I wanted to find something to make this process easier. I bought the OPI Nail Polish Remover ( [[ASIN:B0015GD91U opi EXPERT TOUCH-32oz LACQUER REMOVER]] ) and this stainless steel pump ( [[ASIN:B004O6NEEU Menda High Density Polyethylene ESD Dissipative Dispensing Bottle with Stainless Steel One-Touch Pump]] ) to dispense the remover. I just need two pumps on the thin cotton pad and then the foil easily wraps around my finger. I don&#x27;t have to worry about fussing around with a separate piece of cotton anymore and I&#x27;m happier than ever. These wraps make the process faster for me and I&#x27;m not wasting anymore of my acetone.</li>
    <li> Work great for removing gel polish</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted! These are what they use in the salon but for a much cheaper price now I can do in my own home. These shipped really quickly and that is greatly appreciated!</li>
    <li> These are mighty convenient in lieu of making my own with foil and cotton balls.  The foil seems to really help the process and prevent the acetone/remover from drying up.  I will use them on one hand, then use on the other hand, which helps them last longer.</li>
    <li> easy to soak off gel polish in 15 minutes. I use 5 and reuse the same set to soak off the other hand as another person suggested.</li>
    <li> This product is good, and certainly does the job, but it&#x27;s far too expensive for what it is. I would recommend using the flat cotton pads, cutting them in half and placing them on your nail (after adding acetone, of course) and then wrapping your finger in foil for ten minutes. Same exact thing, much more cost effective.</li>
    <li> I love these. I can put them on, lay on the couch, watch Fraiser and when its over my polish is peeling off by itself. Save your sanity and just get them.</li>
    <li> The time it took to loosen and remove the gel was reduced by about 30% from my previous method and it removed more completely.</li>
    <li> These are the same removal wraps that my nail tech uses.  I didn&#x27;t want to keep paying the $18 to have my gelcolor removed, so I decided to try these at home.  They work great.  The trick is to leave them on for at least 15 minutes, and then the polish comes off easily.</li>
    <li> I initially bought this small package of 20 wraps just to give them a try and they actually surprised me. They arrived very fast and did an excellent job of removing the gel polish after adding acetone to the cotton pad and letting them stay on my nails for about 5 mins. They even worked on my toes.They&#x27;re very easy to use and very convenient so I went back and ordered 5 more packs of 20 just to have them on hand.</li>
    <li> The product arrived as ordered, it did not work so well for me. It is difficult to maintain contact between your fingernail and the acetone on the small incorporated pad. I think I will try putting a cotton ball inside where the pad is instead. In that case they are basically justfoil wraps which I think I could find cheaper.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy I received my item thank you!</li>
    <li> These really work.  Bought a acrylic removal acetone from Walmart that I use with these and by the time I get fingers on both hands wrapped, the acrylic has bubbled up and comes off with just a wipe.  Eureka!</li>
    <li> Love these for removing shellac. . . .works very quickly and easily.</li>
    <li> Always arrive on time and these wraps are great!</li>
    <li> I bought these to remove my shellac and these work great. So much easier than trying to make your own cotton ball/foil removers and less messy. If you don&#x27;t want to go to the salon to get your shellac removed, this is a great product.</li>
    <li> I love gel polish, which is a true miracle product and this makes removal a snap. I use just a smidge of pure acetone on each pad, then wrap each nail and put rubber gloves on, 15 minutes later the polish rubs right off! A must have for your manicure. Thanks Amazon Prime!!!</li>
    <li> it took a very very very long tme to receive these, I know that the seller that I got them from was shipping from overseas, which always takes longer, (I wasn&#x27;t aware that it would be shipped from overseas at the time I ordered it, should have checked), however, I order stuff on here quit often, and receive items from overseas often as well, and this took about 3 times as long as all the other items I ordered from overseas, during the same time period, to arrive! and it is such a small package, I don&#x27;t understand why that was, unless they were just slow on shipping it out, I did have to email them about it, then received it not long after.... ?&lt;br /&gt;the product is okay, it works, just as any foil remover wraps would, the packaging of these are not good though, you open it and they all fall out, and you can&#x27;t keep the rest in the package, I had to put them in a ziplock baggie, (there is 20 of these, I only used 10 at a time..) so there is only enough for either one or 2 uses (depending on if you are doing a mani and pedi or just one or the other), so they wont last long. I got this package since it was cheaper, but was a good name, I really like opi products, had decent reviews, and I had not yet tried foil remover wraps, so I wanted to try it out, so I didn&#x27;t need many to just give it a try. they are helpful, you don&#x27;t have to do the cotton and tape thing, or keep your nails soaking for a long period of time, so I really do llike that, however it does not save any time on removing the polish (I was removing gel polish). it took the same amount of time for me, but it did make the process a little easier. I would buy these again, or something similar (same thing diff brand), but not from the same seller, since it took so long to get here...</li>
    <li> I use gel polish done at home.  These are great to remove them.  I just put the wrap on the top of my acetone bottle and tip to get it saturated and then wrap around my nails.  I have tried all different wrapping sequences and prefer to wrap it on the front and back first and then secure the sides by folding the ends up on top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only negative is that I have large fingers and would prefer slightly larger wraps..  but they save a lot of time.  I used to make my own, but these are so inexpensive, and easy.  Also, when I was close to the last and only had a few left.  I used them on my right hand first and then reused them on my left!</li>
    <li> These are effective but are difficult to apply by yourself.  They work best in a salon when used by a professional.</li>
    <li> Love these! Foil is much more manageable than the gelish foil wraps, especially when doing your own nails. Great product!</li>
    <li> It works just ok. Who has the time to wear foils on your hand for an hour. I still had to chip away at my nails.</li>
    <li> These are the very best way to remove Gel polish! Minimal scraping, and so easy to put on.</li>
    <li> These work great removing gel polish, and even acrylic nails. These are a great value, I&#x27;ve bought some in stores for much more.</li>
