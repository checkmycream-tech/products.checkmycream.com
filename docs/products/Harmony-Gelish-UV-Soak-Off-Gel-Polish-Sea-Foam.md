      <li>It&#x27;s just the right amount of pop without being too overpowering!</li>
      <li>She was also right about that!  </li>
      <li>This color is perfect for when you want a little color but not too much!</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s pretty close to the perfect mint green.</li>
      <li>but I still love it and the product came fastly.</li>
      <li>Super girlie pastel and just like ALL of my colors...</li>
      <li>Even so, the color is still very pretty.  </li>
      <li>I was really hoping for a prettier light teal color.</li>
      <li>I own Up In The Blue</li>
      <li>This color is more of a light blue than a &amp;#34;Seafoam</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a funky fun color.</li>
      <li>but it was worth all the time and effort.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Sea Foam from Gelish is a cool, pretty blue-green.</li>
      <li>The polish stays for about two weeks and this particular color is fantastic.</li>
      <li>First I want to say that I love the Gelish line in general.</li>
      <li>The product is ok I just thought it would be more green than it is.</li>
      <li>The color is a bit more bluish green than anticipated but very true to swatches and the bottle&#x27;s window.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more of a baby blue to me</li>
      <li>I think the color is pretty spot on with the pictures I have seen.</li>
      <li>I will be taking it back hoping to find better luck with Gelish as I am a CND Shellac lover.</li>
      <li>The color is &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; but not the pretty minty color on the swatch.</li>
      <li>I have to say I was nervous at first</li>
      <li>;)  </li>
      <li>That being said, it really is pretty, and if you are looking for a Tiffany-tea</li>
      <li>My best advise as always is that no matter frost vs. creme always go 2-3 very, very, very thin coats.  </li>
      <li>The color is a little flat/matte, but I added a light coat of sparkle on top.</li>
      <li>I used it with my Depend GelLack light, and it works very well, even though  it may not stay on as long as the original Depend polishes.</li>
      <li>It was received very fast and packaged very well.</li>
      <li>I found that by putting on a coat of gelish&#x27;s snow bunny first, the color really pops.</li>
      <li>Loved the color - the user pics added on here are the same color as mine turned out - mint matte green in my opinion - went on smooth - did two coats,</li>
      <li>One of the reviewers stated that the color had a bit more gray in it than she expected, and I agree.  </li>
      <li>I really didn&#x27;t like this color at all.  </li>
      <li>It is very comparable to the  &amp;#34;Tiffany Blue&amp;#34; ...</li>
      <li>The one thing that I didn&#x27;t like was that the coats are very transparent.  </li>
      <li>She also said that if you apply it over gelish Snow Bunny, the color really pops.  </li>
      <li>Haha, I haven&#x27;t worn it since.</li>
      <li>This is a nice lightish sea green.</li>
      <li>I paired it with a sparkling green and it was nice.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product.  </li>
      <li>Lovely sage colour, a little darker than the image shows.</li>
      <li>The color is more of a seafoam green.</li>
      <li>If I had used the white underneath, it may have covered more easily.&lt;br /&gt;Other people have mentioned that it has a grey tone to it.  </li>
      <li>Egg green go for Mint of Spring (another adorable shade).  </li>
      <li>I was hoping for more of a mint green color</li>
      <li>Only caveat, it does sometimes take three coats to get the right color.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Since I started using Gelish about 8 months ago, I&#x27;ve slowly but surely built up my color collection.  Lately, I&#x27;ve been obsessed with mint green, and when I saw this sea foam green gelish, I got pretty excited.  I&#x27;m really glad I read the reviews here on Amazon.  One of the reviewers stated that the color had a bit more gray in it than she expected, and I agree.  She also said that if you apply it over gelish Snow Bunny, the color really pops.  She was also right about that!  It seems to take a bit of the blue-gray tint away when applied over Snow Bunny.  Now, I&#x27;m loving this color, it&#x27;s pretty close to the perfect mint green.</li>
    <li> This color is a light agua-like color. The picture seemed a little grey to me, but its brighter in person. Gelish makes great products!</li>
    <li> I love Sea Foam Gel Polish. I got a ton of comments from everyone while wearing it. It reminds me of a color from the 60&#x27;s. It&#x27;s a funky fun color.</li>
    <li> The color is good....my kids loved it. The polish, however, is very,  dry runny....much more than any Gelish product I have or ever used. Beauty Shine said they would replace it at their discretion after contacting them. Guess you get what you pay for....and that means product and service.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t like this color at all.  In fact, the people I showed it to thought it was grey and not green.  I will try it with the snowbunny as was suggested here next time.  Hopefully, I will get some use out of it, but this is my least favorite Gelish color that I have tried so far and I think I have tried 8 colors so far.  I removed it after 3 days when I usually wear my Gelish for 2 weeks, but it was so unbecoming!</li>
    <li> I used 3 thin coats to get complete opacity but it was worth all the time and effort.&lt;br /&gt;It looked excactly like the color on the monitor, didn&#x27;t have too much grey in it either.&lt;br /&gt;Just beautiful minty turquoise, pastel green.&lt;br /&gt;I have For Audrey by China glaze and this color is like that mixed with white, half and half.</li>
    <li> Love the color..It is very comparable to the  &amp;#34;Tiffany Blue&amp;#34; ...I always get alot of compliments when I wear this color.</li>
    <li> I think this color is so cute. I was afraid to purchase it when i read the reviews thinking it would be an ugly color, but it is a cute sea foam.</li>
    <li> this is a muted green.  I paired it with a sparkling green and it was nice.  I have&#x27;t tried it by itself though.</li>
    <li> Love the color but the polish is very thin.  This seems to be the only issue I&#x27;ve come across so far.</li>
    <li> Love this color. It was received very fast and packaged very well.</li>
    <li> By far the prettiest color i own!!</li>
    <li> The color is a little flat/matte, but I added a light coat of sparkle on top. Brightened it. It will favor yellower/tanner skin tones over pale/pinker ones.</li>
    <li> This color is more of a light blue than a &amp;#34;Seafoam Green&amp;#34; I will say, but I still like it. Very pretty :)</li>
    <li> sooooo runny and light ugly mint green</li>
    <li> Gelish strikes again - I&#x27;m still in love!  Excellent color.  I find the &amp;#34;cremes&amp;#34; a bit more challenging to work with and they account for about 50% of my Gelish collection.  My best advise as always is that no matter frost vs. creme always go 2-3 very, very, very thin coats.  Streaky is ok on the first coat as we know Gelish loves to self level.  The color is a bit more bluish green than anticipated but very true to swatches and the bottle&#x27;s window. I own Up In The Blue and It&#x27;s A Lily and they would be kind of cool in some kind of scheme together.  Super girlie pastel and just like ALL of my colors...I will wear them in ALL seasons because well...I do whatever I want ;)  Super cutie pastel, pale baby shower type green.  If you want something STRONGER and blatantly Easter Egg green go for Mint of Spring (another adorable shade).  Go Gelish!!!</li>
    <li> I think that the color is a little more blue than shown but I still love it and the product came fastly.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for more of a mint green color but it looks like it has a touch of gray in it.  Even so, the color is still very pretty.  Like a subdued sea green color.  I found that by putting on a coat of gelish&#x27;s snow bunny first, the color really pops.</li>
    <li> Love this color.  It looks so beautiful on nails and makes hands look so pretty.  I get many compliments on this color.  Great for spring and summer months.</li>
    <li> I love this color. I have to say I was nervous at first but this is my favorite color. Highly recommend this product.  goes on light so I used 3 coats.</li>
    <li> Gelish is my favorite brand of gel polish. I have ordered many colors, and this one is just...ugly. Maybe it&#x27;s my skin color but it just clashes and looks terrible. Someone told me that it looked like \\&quot;weird, green cement\\&quot;. Haha, I haven&#x27;t worn it since. I was really hoping for a prettier light teal color. Too bad!</li>
    <li> This is the perfect polish i have been looking all around for. I love Gelish polish &amp; application for gel nails. Thank you</li>
    <li> This color is perfect for when you want a little color but not too much! It&#x27;s just the right amount of pop without being too overpowering!</li>
    <li> It took 4 coats for this color to look good, which was a pain. It hardly lasted a week before lifting around the sides. I will be taking it back hoping to find better luck with Gelish as I am a CND Shellac lover.</li>
    <li> I bought this color for a recent trip to Miami, FL. It covers well and the color looks great. I add an accent nail with some gold for a little extra flair.</li>
    <li> Gelish is the best for us professionals...Love!!</li>
    <li> great product arrived in a timely fashion... it came in a good package by this product you will love it great quality</li>
    <li> Love the color, would recomend it. It is a soft color, I can wear it to work and not have it stand out.</li>
    <li> First I want to say that I love the Gelish line in general. The color is &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; but not the pretty minty color on the swatch. The color is more of a seafoam green.</li>
    <li> Loved the color - the user pics added on here are the same color as mine turned out - mint matte green in my opinion - went on smooth - did two coats, very clean application (some are clumpy/thin/thick/wavy). I think this will become one of my faves!</li>
    <li> I love Gelish but this color isn&#x27;t my favorite.  It has a lot of gray in it so the color doesn&#x27;t pop at all.  On its own I think it is ugly.  So I have used it as a base under some other colors and have had some success with it.  I have also used it as a base under some of the heavy glitter polishes to help tone down the glitter because with a muted color as a base you don&#x27;t have to do multiple coats of the glitter polishes.  I have very fair skin.  This color may work better with darker skin tones.</li>
    <li> I love Gelish! I probably own over 30 of their colors and this one is just another perfect addition to my Gelish collection!! I love it!</li>
    <li> I have been using Gelish products for a little over a year now and this is one of my favorite colors.  The one thing that I didn&#x27;t like was that the coats are very transparent.  It took three coats for this to cover well.  If I had used the white underneath, it may have covered more easily.&lt;br /&gt;Other people have mentioned that it has a grey tone to it.  I don&#x27;t agree.  I think the color is pretty spot on with the pictures I have seen.</li>
    <li> This is a nice lightish sea green.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely my favorite gel color that I own. I have to stop myself from wearing it nonstop. It&#x27;s a great fun summery color and I think it would look nice with any complexion. Only caveat, it does sometimes take three coats to get the right color.</li>
    <li> It did not come out well. We tried many times but not good so far. Thickness is vary depend on color. This color was very thin.</li>
    <li> Gelish is not as expensive as Shellac but just as amazing. The polish stays for about two weeks and this particular color is fantastic. I have gotten so many compliments. This color is a must have.</li>
    <li> Gelish does not dissapoint. It&#x27;s my favorite gel brand. I would not say this color is mint green, at least mine wasn&#x27;t, it has a touch of light tiffany blue in it. Very Springy and trendy. Two coats show-up lovely. Nice with a very light layer of IBD All that Glitters gold glitter gel polish over it. This Sea Foam color is one of my favs.</li>
    <li> Lovely sage colour, a little darker than the image shows. I used it with my Depend GelLack light, and it works very well, even though  it may not stay on as long as the original Depend polishes. This is for me plus, because I have some trouble getting the Depend polishes off all together. The Harmony polish I can pull off after a week or so.</li>
    <li> Definitely cheaper than getting my nails done, but the color appeared to be more of a baby blue or a robin egg&#x27;s blue instead of sea foam.</li>
    <li> The product is ok I just thought it would be more green than it is. It&#x27;s more of a baby blue to me so I asked friends and they all felt the same way. It&#x27;s good if you want something more blue :)</li>
    <li> Sea Foam from Gelish is a cool, pretty blue-green. When dry, it is very close to a Tiffany blue, which is whupping I only gave it four stars. While it is very pretty, it&#x27;s a littler less green and more blue than I was expecting. That being said, it really is pretty, and if you are looking for a Tiffany-tea., this is perfect for you!,</li>
