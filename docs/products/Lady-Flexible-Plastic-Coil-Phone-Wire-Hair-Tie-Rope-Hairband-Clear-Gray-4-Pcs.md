      <li>Perfect!</li>
      <li>I am so happy they arrived.</li>
      <li>Great product, and very easy to use.</li>
      <li>Waited more than a month</li>
      <li>So glad I found them.</li>
      <li>MY DOG REALLY ENJOYED EATING THE ONE HE GOT AHOLD OF</li>
      <li>I bought much better ones than these so its not the product design, just this product itself.</li>
      <li>she wears a size 4/5T  and has fine hair.  </li>
      <li>Great quality and totally with the $</li>
      <li>GREAT LITTLE HAIR TIES.</li>
      <li>They stretch out after first use.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used them so much!</li>
      <li>These are a bit too large and stretchy, and became looser each time I used them.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>I really like the coil hair ties.  </li>
      <li>I have other phone wire hair ties and they are larger, sturdier, and better made than these, which feel cheap and plasticky.</li>
      <li>I had purchased a pack of several of this type of hair tie in the past and loved them, they always held my hair in place without always having to readjust and they lasted for years til they eventually broke or got lost.  </li>
      <li>, I ordered 8 of the clear ones, and instead they sent me 8 colored ones.</li>
      <li>It stretches out way too fast causing it to expand and not hold my hair snug enough.</li>
      <li>I really prefer these to other rubber hair bands.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re OK, but a little too small.</li>

<li> I really prefer these to other rubber hair bands.</li>
<li> They&#x27;re OK, but a little too small.</li>
<li> They are weak and don&#x27;t hold very well.</li>
<li> and it did not come not worth 3 dollar.</li>
<li> But I don&#x27;t think they are sized for a grown up, and definitely not one with thick hair.)</li>
<li> These are a little thicker than the other spiral ones I have.</li>
<li> They will not fit on a wrist.  </li>
<li> If you haven&#x27;t used these in you hair then you don&#x27;t know what you are missing.</li>
<li> They wont break your hair and hold even thin hair in a ponytail.</li>
<li> Not impressed.</li>
<li> Hoped it would not cause my hair to be indented from the hairband, but it was not as bad as the elastic ones.</li>
<li> I like it at the beginning until when I try to take it off, it hurts my hair so bad!</li>

    <li> GREAT LITTLE HAIR TIES. THEY DON&#x27;T TANGLE AS MUCH AS REGULAR ELASTICS. WOULD BUY AGAIN. MY DOG REALLY ENJOYED EATING THE ONE HE GOT AHOLD OF AS WELL. -_-</li>
    <li> I bought much better ones than these so its not the product design, just this product itself. They are weak and don&#x27;t hold very well.</li>
    <li> I really like the coil hair ties.  The stay in my hair and don&#x27;t pull it out. So glad I found them.</li>
    <li> Great quality and totally with the $</li>
    <li> Great product, and very easy to use. Thanks</li>
    <li> The coil looses it&#x27;s elaciticity immediately. It stretches out way too fast causing it to expand and not hold my hair snug enough.</li>
    <li> I have other phone wire hair ties and they are larger, sturdier, and better made than these, which feel cheap and plasticky. If I&#x27;d realized they were coming from China, I would not have ordered them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I ordered 8 of the clear ones, and instead they sent me 8 colored ones. Not impressed.</li>
    <li> These are a little thicker than the other spiral ones I have. I&#x27;m hoping they&#x27;ll soften up with use &amp; warmth</li>
    <li> Yea, they arrived at last. These are stronger then the ones I found at the mall. I am so happy they arrived. If you haven&#x27;t used these in you hair then you don&#x27;t know what you are missing. They wont break your hair and hold even thin hair in a ponytail. The only thing I am disapointed was they took a month to get here.</li>
    <li> Perfect! I&#x27;ve used them so much!</li>
    <li> Waited more than a month and it did not come not worth 3 dollar. I feel like I was scammed!!!</li>
    <li> They are really tiny and tangle in your hair unlike the actual swirly do&#x27;s. They stretch out after first use.</li>
    <li> I had purchased a pack of several of this type of hair tie in the past and loved them, they always held my hair in place without always having to readjust and they lasted for years til they eventually broke or got lost.  They were smaller and didn&#x27;t need to be wrapped several times around your ponytail.  These are a bit too large and stretchy, and became looser each time I used them.</li>
    <li> These are tiny.  They will not fit on a wrist.  (Maybe my daughter&#x27;s? she wears a size 4/5T  and has fine hair.  But I don&#x27;t think they are sized for a grown up, and definitely not one with thick hair.)</li>
    <li> I really prefer these to other rubber hair bands.</li>
