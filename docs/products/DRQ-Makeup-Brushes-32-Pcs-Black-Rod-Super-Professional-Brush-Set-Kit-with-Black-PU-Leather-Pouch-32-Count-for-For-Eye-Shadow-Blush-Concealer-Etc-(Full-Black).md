<li> Weird smell, but nice brushes.</li>
<li> The brushes had so many random single strands that were longer.</li>
<li> And there were a few that i am sure weren&#x27;t even supposed to be in the set because the metal part that connects in the center were green instead of black like the rest.</li>
<li> The bristles on the smaller brushes were shiny and black.</li>
<li> I have other makeup brushes and never experience that.</li>
<li> Just what I expected!</li>
<li> They&#x27;re extremely thin and stiff.</li>
<li> This was the second set I bought for the fan brush and was disappointed with this one as well.</li>
<li> but I was not happy with the fan brush.  </li>
<li> so I knew I was probably making a bad choice with these brushes.</li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>
<li> I HATE THESE BRUSHES!  </li>

    <li> This product is excellent and arrived in very good time.</li>
    <li> fantastico por todas las cosas que tiene</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. I bought two, a set for myself and my mother. The brushes had so many random single strands that were longer. So many repetitive brushes. And there were a few that i am sure weren&#x27;t even supposed to be in the set because the metal part that connects in the center were green instead of black like the rest. Would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> They were wonderful and there were allot of them</li>
    <li> Was so happy to get all these brushes, and lovely little roll out case for them as well. They work fine, I haven&#x27;t noticed any shedding as other reviews have said. The package does smell like plastic when you first open it, but it fades.</li>
    <li> was for my daughter in law&#x27;s present.  When she opened it, she was amazed at how many there were.  Quote &amp;#34;This is more brushes than I will use in my life.  Boy is my cousin going to be jealous. LOL&amp;#34; end quote  so I guess I did good.</li>
    <li> Very good quality make-up brushes. They exceeded my expectations. They&#x27;re worth the price.</li>
    <li> Loved the brushes .. Although a lot of brushes are repeated ! So I mean it was kind of a bubble burster but good quality for 15$</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a makeup artist for many years so I knew I was probably making a bad choice with these brushes. I was right! But since there were so many good reviews and YouTube videos I had to see for myself.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BELIEVE ANY OF IT!&lt;br /&gt;These makeup brushes are far from professional! I&#x27;ve used cheap brushes that are  better. They&#x27;re extremely thin and stiff. Some of them might have been good for eyeliner but I didn&#x27;t even bother trying them because they were so cheap. I immediately packed them up and sent them back.</li>
    <li> I got one I received 30 incomplete brushes&lt;br /&gt;😣😤</li>
    <li> I thought these brushes would be great and loved the fact that there are so many brushes but when I opened it and was just looking at them bristles were just falling out of the brushes and the quality of them was very cheap and not soft. I would rather spend more money and get better quality brushes next time.</li>
    <li> Just what I expected! Love these brushes. !</li>
    <li> These brushes are an ok set but I was not happy with the fan brush.  The eye and lip brushes are great but the fan brush which is what I really needed was not as firm as it should have been to be really usable for the intended purposes.  This was the second set I bought for the fan brush and was disappointed with this one as well. If your looking for a great fan brush so to sephora and pay the 30.00 for it.  If you are a looking for great eye and lip brushes this this is a good set.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great, many dioffernet designs. very nice.</li>
    <li> Lots of brushes... but lots of the same kind.  No angle brush included.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t care for some of the larger brushes</li>
    <li> These brushes are nothing like the picture or description. The bristles on the smaller brushes were shiny and black. Not at all brown or natural. One brush I had to toss out because of all the glue clumped in the bristles!! Several brushes were duplicated 2 and 3 times, so don&#x27;t be excited about &amp;#34;32&amp;#34;.#VERY Dissatisfied</li>
    <li> I really liked the brushes. They are soft and exactly what I needed. Nice customer service...</li>
    <li> bought for my wife she loves them</li>
    <li> I notice when I use the brushes i get pieces of the brush on my face. I don&#x27;t think that should be happening I have other makeup brushes and never experience that.</li>
    <li> Look like picture!!!!</li>
    <li> I HATE THESE BRUSHES!  Bristles fallling out on your face.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them to anyone!</li>
    <li> They arrived in great condition. A brush  for every purpose.</li>
    <li> I love the brushes and the case it is in.</li>
    <li> Not bad for the price.</li>
    <li> Weird smell, but nice brushes. Hopefully wont shead</li>
    <li> Brushes are great no problem about them but when blending it feels kinda wobbly as if it&#x27;s just going to fall off other then that I give it an A-</li>
    <li> I bought these as a gift for my sister she loves them. They came packaged so well and are very soft and useful the only reason why it had four stars is because the packaging did smell like paint 😊</li>
    <li> Amazing brushes great quality for 15 bucks!</li>
