### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Extremely happy I found this!  </li>
      <li>It creates the perfect balance.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s greatest.</li>
      <li>Best if used alone.</li>
      <li>I am impressed and happy with the results.</li>
      <li>I think this is a great product and would not have even tried it but for a sample I got from fragrancenet.com with my order.  </li>
      <li>Does not do good under makeup.</li>
      <li>A good friend who is always looking out for great products on the quick fix market turned me on to this</li>
      <li>SO I am loving it.  </li>
      <li>but you have to find that fine line between allowing the product work best and the application being too much.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;THE PRODUCT IS OK....</li>
      <li>I am glad I decided to wait to order it.</li>
      <li>I love my results</li>
      <li>Based on a sample I received, I was pleased with how this product reduced the lines around and under my eyes.</li>
      <li>I tried it and was impressed that the fine lines around my eyes pretty much disappeared.  </li>
      <li>This product might be okay to help with fine lines</li>
      <li>and I have to admit this is pretty amazing stuff</li>
      <li>My fine lines don&#x27;t seemed to diminish, but it did help the morning puffy eyes.</li>
      <li>Excellent product, acts much like Botox, but for a short period of time.</li>
      <li>Each of us is unique and this product will let that show if we let it.</li>
      <li>I decided to go ahead and order the full size bottle.  </li>
      <li>I have been asked by several friends how I keep my skin looking so good.</li>
      <li>Works good but the pump stopped working the second time I used it .</li>
      <li>On the whole, though, a good product and the only one of the many I&#x27;ve tried that has had much effect.</li>
      <li>Really doesn&#x27;t erase fine lines.</li>
      <li>I dabbed it in the fine lines near my eyes, as directed, but saw zero change whatsoever.  </li>
      <li>i think a person like that would be quite pleased with this product and for that person, i would rate the product a 4.5..but for the person who wears makeup and lip liner, this product doesn&#x27;t work properly underneath foundation.  </li>
      <li>One more thing, one of these will last me just over a month.  </li>
      <li>The first time was on me.</li>
      <li>Maybe get a sample first and see what results you get.</li>
      <li>At first I was concerned about mixing ingredients of two products but there has been no sensitivity or reaction for me.</li>
      <li>Then i got my liquid make up out and applied it in the normal areas of my face and quickly realized that make up</li>
      <li>I am mid-50&#x27;s, blue eyed and blonde, fair skin and prone to sun wrinkles.  </li>
      <li>I let it completely dry and was pleased with the results at that point.  </li>
      <li>it works great... as long as you don&#x27;t wear makeup I applied as directed let dry and was like wow!!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t care that my fine lines show at home but in public, i would prefer to have them diminished.  </li>
      <li>For the price (very high), one should expect a product that works.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 42 and virtually wrinkle free except under my eyes and a deep wrinkle between my eyebrows.</li>
      <li>I had to wash my whole face off and start over, NOT using the product this time.  </li>
      <li>so I was ready to order a bottle</li>
      <li>Expected more for the money.  </li>
      <li>Really works for me.</li>
      <li>but you can order directly from Fragrance.net and get 15% coupon and sometimes after your first order they will send you a $25.00 saving coupon.</li>
      <li>I applied the product lightly under each eye and above my upper lip and in the smile lines on each side of my face.  </li>
      <li>Have to leave it sitting upside down to be able to use the pump.</li>
      <li>I tried so many products and wasted so much money.</li>
      <li>I received a small sample of this product and tried it over a weekend (when i&#x27;m not normally wearing any makeup) and I would say that i did notice a difference in my very light fine lines around my eyes.  </li>
      <li>Had trouble with the bottle being able to pump.</li>
      <li>I have light lines above my upper lip</li>
      <li>While i do recommend this product for someone that is natural and doesn&#x27;t not wear lip liner/ makeup..</li>
      <li>Works really well for deep creases on my under bags...</li>
      <li>I promised to grow old gracefully and stay out of the plastic surgeon&#x27;s office.</li>
      <li>and this is the only eye/skin product I have used which really works.</li>
      <li>FREQUENTLY THERE IS A PROBLEM GETTING THE SERUM FROM THE BOTTLE....</li>
      <li>I am 68 years old and have many small lines and wrinkles, especially around my eyes and mouth.</li>
      <li>Do not use too much since you will get a fine white film - a little goes a long way.  </li>
      <li>I remedy that by mixing a 3/4 tiny dab of teamine eye cream with 1/4 tiny dab of this product (not even a whole pump of the product-</li>
      <li>Twice, the pump stopped working while the container was still half full; the third time, it didn&#x27;t work at all!  </li>
      <li>We returned the product to the manufacturer as the bottle was half full and it was a solid block.</li>
      <li>They didn&#x27;t completely go away, but they were definitely lessened.</li>
      <li>Does work well on bare skin..</li>
      <li>I tried a sample and the first few minutes my wrinkles were 50 % gone</li>

<li> I depress the pump not even half way), swirling it on my fingertip then applying under both eyes.</li>
<li> other&#x27;s are experiencing.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t try it with foundation, so I&#x27;m not sure what might happen with that, but there is definitely something a little off about how this serum works when makeup is put over it.</li>
<li> , i ended up with the same globby,, smudging, icky look and had to take it all off.  </li>
<li> These bottles will last me forever because it takes a very small amount.</li>
<li> Slightly hesitate about applyings serum since I didn&#x27;t have wrinkles around the eyes, but I wanted to start maintaining before wrinkles occur.  </li>
<li> I have dark circles and when this has dried, it lightens, so don&#x27;t have to use concealer anymore.</li>
<li> Tried it under foundation and it was a mess.</li>
<li> It was so messy I remove everything with makeup remover.</li>
<li> My wife has tried this product three times over the past year.  </li>
<li> but I decided to wait at least 1 day to see the effect around my eyes.</li>
<li> unfortunately I was handed this down from my father&#x27;s side..</li>
<li> and I saw like an awful dry white paste around my eyes.</li>
<li> My wife has used this product in the past, but something is definetely wrong.</li>
<li> Ridiculous!</li>
<li> And after about 30 seconds it started burning so bad</li>
<li> grr..</li>
<li> but if you do well don&#x27;t :-(</li>
<li> AWFUL!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> A good friend who is always looking out for great products on the quick fix market turned me on to this and I have to admit this is pretty amazing stuff but you have to find that fine line between allowing the product work best and the application being too much.  Each of us is unique and this product will let that show if we let it.</li>
    <li> Did not get the results as advertised.  Expected more for the money.  If it worked I would have reordered again.</li>
    <li> I tried a sample and the first few minutes my wrinkles were 50 % gone so I was ready to order a bottle but I decided to wait at least 1 day to see the effect around my eyes. After 1 hour I checked my wrinkles and I saw like an awful dry white paste around my eyes. So I tried to cover it with foundation. Did not work at all. It was so messy I remove everything with makeup remover. It was just a very short dream. I am glad I decided to wait to order it.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of Instant eye serum from Fragrancenet.com when ordering perfume. It worked just as described. I was quite amazed, because I am such a skeptic when it comes to beauty claims. I am 68 years old and have many small lines and wrinkles, especially around my eyes and mouth. This product doesn&#x27;t totally vanquish these persistent lines, but it is way ahead of anything else I have tried. I wear a foundation and had on problems using it over the serum. I have been asked by several friends how I keep my skin looking so good. Works for me.</li>
    <li> Works good but the pump stopped working the second time I used it . So I had to open it and use my finger so it makes me use it faster.</li>
    <li> This product might be okay to help with fine lines but it does not go well under makeup.  It needs to be changed or something. Ridiculous!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, acts much like Botox, but for a short period of time. It&#x27;s too drying for me to use under the eyes, but I do use it on and around the lip area.</li>
    <li> Could not see a difference</li>
    <li> Based on a sample I received, I was pleased with how this product reduced the lines around and under my eyes. They didn&#x27;t completely go away, but they were definitely lessened. But I will also agree with an earlier review that my tinted moisturizer looked a bit odd at the places where I&#x27;d applied this product. I didn&#x27;t try it with foundation, so I&#x27;m not sure what might happen with that, but there is definitely something a little off about how this serum works when makeup is put over it. Just something to watch out for. On the whole, though, a good product and the only one of the many I&#x27;ve tried that has had much effect.</li>
    <li> Does not do good under makeup. Best if used alone. Had trouble with the bottle being able to pump. Have to leave it sitting upside down to be able to use the pump.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this with another order.  I dabbed it in the fine lines near my eyes, as directed, but saw zero change whatsoever.  And after about 30 seconds it started burning so bad I had to rinse it off.  Won&#x27;t be wasting my money on this any time soon!</li>
    <li> Works really well for deep creases on my under bags...unfortunately I was handed this down from my father&#x27;s side..grr..but this product works well. ..would definitely recommend</li>
    <li> FREQUENTLY THERE IS A PROBLEM GETTING THE SERUM FROM THE BOTTLE....&lt;br /&gt;THE PRODUCT IS OK.... ONCE IT IS OUT OF THE CONTAINER.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used the sample, but I will be ordering from Amazon. I&#x27;m 44yo and this is the only eye/skin product I have used which really works. I am impressed and happy with the results. Maybe get a sample first and see what results you get. I love my results</li>
    <li> I received a sample and decided to give it a try. My fine lines don&#x27;t seemed to diminish, but it did help the morning puffy eyes.</li>
    <li> OMG! it works great... as long as you don&#x27;t wear makeup I applied as directed let dry and was like wow!! the went to put on my liquid foundation and UGH! it doesn&#x27;t mesh woth makeup at all left a funky smudge mess. Thus if you don&#x27;t wear makeup get it... but if you do well don&#x27;t :-(</li>
    <li> I received a small sample of this product and tried it over a weekend (when i&#x27;m not normally wearing any makeup) and I would say that i did notice a difference in my very light fine lines around my eyes.  I have light lines above my upper lip so i applied the product there as well.  I decided to go ahead and order the full size bottle.  Since i work during the week and am one that wears foundation/lip liner/eyemakeup etc i figured i would try this under my make up and see what it did.  I don&#x27;t care that my fine lines show at home but in public, i would prefer to have them diminished.  I applied the product lightly under each eye and above my upper lip and in the smile lines on each side of my face.  I let it completely dry and was pleased with the results at that point.  Then i got my liquid make up out and applied it in the normal areas of my face and quickly realized that make up does NOT go over this product well.  It left a cake/line smudge look and i had to use a sponge to remove it.  Then i went to apply my lip liner, it too didn&#x27;t work or glide properly and it left a feathered look on my upper lip.  I had to wash my whole face off and start over, NOT using the product this time.  While i do recommend this product for someone that is natural and doesn&#x27;t not wear lip liner/ makeup..i think a person like that would be quite pleased with this product and for that person, i would rate the product a 4.5..but for the person who wears makeup and lip liner, this product doesn&#x27;t work properly underneath foundation.  Not at all!  I even tried it with a stick foundation that&#x27;s lighter to no avail, i ended up with the same globby,, smudging, icky look and had to take it all off.  For the price, i would think that they would have tried this out on a person wearing makeup, the box even said you can apply under your makeup....</li>
    <li> My wife has tried this product three times over the past year.  Twice, the pump stopped working while the container was still half full; the third time, it didn&#x27;t work at all!  For the price (very high), one should expect a product that works.  AVOID!</li>
    <li> My wife has used this product in the past, but something is definetely wrong. We returned the product to the manufacturer as the bottle was half full and it was a solid block. AWFUL! Not at all what the product is supposed to be.&lt;br /&gt;This is the second time we received this non-usable bottle. The first time was on me. The 2nd was returned and my wife will not be ordering this again. She will find something else to use.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Really works for me. I use it over my liquid foundation and it works. Tried it under foundation and it was a mess. I have dark circles and when this has dried, it lightens, so don&#x27;t have to use concealer anymore. This product does not work with powder or mineral foundation. Does work well on bare skin..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 42 and virtually wrinkle free except under my eyes and a deep wrinkle between my eyebrows. I received a sample gift and I was astonished at the results. My skin tightened up and you couldn&#x27;t even notice I had wrinkles. I&#x27;m a bit put off by the price so I&#x27;ll wait until I can afford it.</li>
    <li> Since my purchase, I can already tell that the eye serum has made such a difference in the skin under the eyes, its a smoother surface.  Slightly hesitate about applyings serum since I didn&#x27;t have wrinkles around the eyes, but I wanted to start maintaining before wrinkles occur.  SO I am loving it.  I have already recommended this product to sisters and friends.</li>
    <li> I think this is a great product and would not have even tried it but for a sample I got from fragrancenet.com with my order.  I tried it and was impressed that the fine lines around my eyes pretty much disappeared.  The deeper character lines were also softened a bit.  Do not use too much since you will get a fine white film - a little goes a long way.  There was also a coupon with the sample so that made a purchase decision easier.  I am mid-50&#x27;s, blue eyed and blonde, fair skin and prone to sun wrinkles.  I am not kidding myself, this won&#x27;t erase what time has done but it will soften it.  I promised to grow old gracefully and stay out of the plastic surgeon&#x27;s office.</li>
    <li> It help to decrease wrinkles around the mouth and eye area.</li>
    <li> This serum does what I need it to for the puffiness under my eyes. If used alone it will have a &amp;#34;taut&amp;#34; effect which causes makeup to not look it&#x27;s greatest. I remedy that by mixing a 3/4 tiny dab of teamine eye cream with 1/4 tiny dab of this product (not even a whole pump of the product- I depress the pump not even half way), swirling it on my fingertip then applying under both eyes. At first I was concerned about mixing ingredients of two products but there has been no sensitivity or reaction for me. It creates the perfect balance. I use Lancome under eye concealer and my Estee Lauder double wear foundation without the effects other&#x27;s are experiencing. As for the price, I paid around $65 for two bottles at frangrancenet.com through a coupon code that was given to me from one of the samples. These bottles will last me forever because it takes a very small amount. If you can try a sample you will probably be hooked too.</li>
    <li> This last year I have had problems with under eye bags!  I tried so many products and wasted so much money. I happened to see this online, and decided why not... well it works... I do not use moisturizer under it... just the eye serum.. and I do not use a lot...just enough on the tip of my finger to cover the under eye... and it lasts all day. What matters to me... is that it is moisturizing plus, the under eye bags look like they are almost gone. At night I use a regular moisturizer.  But, this eye serum is \\&quot;my go to product in the morning!\\&quot;  Extremely happy I found this!  One more thing, one of these will last me just over a month.  So it can be costly at $55.00 each...but you can order directly from Fragrance.net and get 15% coupon and sometimes after your first order they will send you a $25.00 saving coupon.</li>
    <li> Really doesn&#x27;t erase fine lines.</li>
</ol>
