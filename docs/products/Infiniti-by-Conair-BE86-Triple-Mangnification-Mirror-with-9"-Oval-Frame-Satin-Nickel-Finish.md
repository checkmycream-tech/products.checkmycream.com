      <li>love it.</li>
      <li>You will love the oval shape.  </li>
      <li>I love this mirror.  </li>
      <li>But the oval design and adjustable lighting makes it a worthwhile investment.</li>

      <li>The magnigication is excellent and it has 3 different light settings.  </li>
      <li>Very sturdy, good quality but</li>
      <li>Good product at reasonable price.</li>
      <li>It would also be nice to have a light setting that is more powerful and useful.     </li>
      <li>The regular side is perfect for applying makeup, while the magnified side is great for plucking your eyebrows or other tasks that require a close-up view.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The mirror is light and easy to transport if needed.   </li>
      <li>All was fine until tonight.  </li>
      <li>Just so you know, the light battery inside will die after about 2 years if not sooner.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like the way the light shows in the reflection when I look in the mirror.</li>
      <li>What&#x27;s lacking is the light quality.</li>
      <li>I would prefer a mirror without the light .</li>
      <li>Definately not the old Lady Clarol mirror with the bright lights.</li>
      <li>The light didn&#x27;t work whe</li>
      <li>I have to buy a step-up transformer and do not feel exactly comfortable using it since it gives a buzzing sound.</li>
      <li>Does not feel cheap.  </li>
      <li>The light on the mirror itself is just so so.  </li>
      <li>The light has 3 strength levels</li>
      <li>The touch control is great as well as the bottom extra magnifying part.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t, you&#x27;ll need an additional light source.</li>
      <li>The light will enhance makeup application if you have lighting that is already so-so.</li>
      <li>The magnification is good, and if you hold it up to natural light, it does the job.  </li>
      <li>The lighting could be a little brighter, but it is a nice mirror with good magnification.</li>
      <li>So this is a nice looking mirror that is very sensitive to touch</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s still bright enough).</li>
      <li>I ORDERED THIS MIRROR BECAUSE IT HAD SUCH GOOD REVIEWS</li>
      <li>This mirror functions very well if it is located in a good natural source of light.  </li>
      <li>The built-in light could be a little brighter, but it looks great, and it&#x27;s got the magnification requirements well covered.</li>
      <li>Other than that, this is a great product.</li>
      <li>She says it&#x27;s great and really likes the built in extra magnification spot.</li>
      <li>I would love this product even more if this come in local voltage.</li>
      <li>I have it near a window, so am satisfied, but I wouldn&#x27;t be if I had to depend to the mirror&#x27;s light.  </li>
      <li>Quality of the delivered product was excellent: nice heavy chrome surface, touch type 3 position lighting power adjustment and good quality, clear mirrors (plain, 10X and spot).</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this mirror for women like me who want a good clear view of their face so they can get their makeup on right!</li>
      <li>The lighting is ok, although could be brighter, but you fix this issue by making sure you add other light sources when doing your makeup.  </li>
      <li>The light is not bright enough to be used on its own; you still need another light source with it, either bright daylight, a lamp or an overhead light fixture.  </li>
      <li>This is a solid make-up mirror for the price - nice size, shape, 3-level lighting, and magnification.  </li>
      <li>BECAUSE ALL THE OTHER REVIEWS WERE SO GOOD ON THIS MIRROR</li>
      <li>so she has to bend over to get the right distance from the mirror.</li>
      <li>The price was right for what I received.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had many lighted make-up mirrors over the years and had yet to find one that had adequate lighting, enough magnification, and distortion-free mirror glass.  </li>
      <li>The lighting itself is not super bright</li>
      <li>I am still using my older one for the better lighting and have this new one right next to it for better magnifying purposes.  </li>
      <li>I received my first one two years ago as a Christmas gift.  </li>
      <li>It has a regular 1X side with a small 10X magnification \\&quot;button,\\&quot; and a reverse side with 7X magnification - this is the side that I use and it&#x27;s perfect for me.</li>
      <li>It is exactly what I had been looking for.</li>
      <li>If you have a 5x now, I would only suggest a step up to a better lit 7x mirror.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t understand why someone can&#x27;t make a pretty makeup mirror that doesn&#x27;t distort your face severely.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s so pretty</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the way the light shows in the reflection when I look in the mirror. I would prefer a mirror without the light . The cord is an added mess to the countertop. Too late now.</li>
    <li> I wish the light was much brighter, but the magnification is great. For the price this is a good mirror.</li>
    <li> I wanted a mirror with a regular mirror and a magnified one.  If it went the other direction or was round versus oval, maybe I could see my whole face on the magnified side. A bit dissapointing.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. Works great, looks great and my wife loves it.</li>
    <li> Perfect for what I need.  I do wish it would go off automatically, though, as I&#x27;m still not used to turning it off when finished.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 64-year-old woman with difficulty seeing close up. I&#x27;ve had many lighted make-up mirrors over the years and had yet to find one that had adequate lighting, enough magnification, and distortion-free mirror glass.  My last mirror had been purchased from a speciality store for about $80 and I wasn&#x27;t that happy with it.    I recently purchased my second Conair Infiniti mirror.  I received my first one two years ago as a Christmas gift.  When I got home and plugged it in I was amazed at how clear the images were and how perfect the magnification was. It has a regular 1X side with a small 10X magnification \\&quot;button,\\&quot; and a reverse side with 7X magnification - this is the side that I use and it&#x27;s perfect for me. It has three light settings which are controlled by touching the base of the mirror.  I would prefer that it had a switch instead, but this is only a minor annoyance in my opinion. The only reason that I replaced the original one was that I accidentally broke the mirror on one side. I tried using one of my \\&quot;old\\&quot; mirrors (I have about 4 or 5 of them, always searching for the perfect mirror) but they don&#x27;t compare with the Infiniti. This is why I ordered another one just like it.      I highly recommend this mirror for women like me who want a good clear view of their face so they can get their makeup on right!</li>
    <li> So this is a nice looking mirror that is very sensitive to touch (ie: You will accidently turn it on or off often if you are not careful). The lighting itself is not super bright but it serves it&#x27;s purpose. I used this mirror every day for about 2 years before the lighting stopped working. Just so you know, the light battery inside will die after about 2 years if not sooner.</li>
    <li> Good product at reasonable price. I will like it more if this product with dual Voltage...120&amp; 220</li>
    <li> This mirror arrived in a timely manner and in excellent condition and it is a very pretty mirror that works very well.</li>
    <li> The magnification options on this mirror are great.  The light is not bright enough to be used on its own; you still need another light source with it, either bright daylight, a lamp or an overhead light fixture.  The price was right for what I received.</li>
    <li> The mirror portion of this product is excellent. The mirror is sturdy and looks nice. What&#x27;s lacking is the light quality. It is very poor. I had to add lamps on my vanity for there to be sufficient lighting to do makeup.</li>
    <li> The quality of this mirror is great.  It saddens me to have to return it because the magnification circle at the bottom of the mirror gets in the way and leaves very little room to see myself in the mirror when I apply makeup.  If it didn&#x27;t have this circle at the bottom, I&#x27;d definitely keep the mirror.  The lighting is ok, although could be brighter, but you fix this issue by making sure you add other light sources when doing your makeup.  I love the touch feature to increase the lighting and the 10X magnification mirror on the other side.  Very sturdy, good quality but unfortunately, will have to go back. I&#x27;m going to return it and get a mirror without the magnification circle at the bottom.</li>
    <li> Perfect for tweezing your brows perfectly or finding those little imperfections you didn&#x27;t even know you had! The magnification with this mirror is awesome.</li>
    <li> Pros: the magnification works well, without distortion. The mirror is light and easy to transport if needed.   Cons: the touch-light base does not work well for me as I constantly hit it by accident when applying makeup.</li>
    <li> What a deal!  I did not expect this mirror to be this nice for such a low price.  The lighting is perfect. The magnification is great for tweezing.  It looks great on the bathroom counter, no need to hide it away, it&#x27;s so pretty you will want to leave it out. Also, you simply turn it on by tapping the bottom base, very convenient. I think I will buy one for my mother too!</li>
    <li> I have been hunting around for such a mirror in Singapore for months and the nearest I could find is a lighted wall hung mirror with 3x magnification. I would love this product even more if this come in local voltage. I have to buy a step-up transformer and do not feel exactly comfortable using it since it gives a buzzing sound. I hope that Conair would manufacture in dual voltage(110 &amp; 220v)or at least allow the consumer to choose the voltage they want....talking about going global!</li>
    <li> If you want a very high magnification, this is the mirror for you.  It would work for anyone who isn&#x27;t \\&quot;completely\\&quot; blind.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it, is the lighting from it is dimmer than my older mirror which unfortunately only has 5x magnification.  So although the magnification on the new one is higher, (almost too high) it is not bright enough for me either.  I am still using my older one for the better lighting and have this new one right next to it for better magnifying purposes.  If you have a 5x now, I would only suggest a step up to a better lit 7x mirror.</li>
    <li> I had been looking forward to this product until I plugged it in and turned it on. As I leaned forward to look in the mirror, I was so close I was almost touching it to see myself and that was distorted. When I leaned back a little, forget it, I could not discern my face at all. The light was very dim on the highest setting compared to my old makeup mirror. I irritably packed the mirror up and shipped it back for a refund.    I don&#x27;t understand why someone can&#x27;t make a pretty makeup mirror that doesn&#x27;t distort your face severely. It would also be nice to have a light setting that is more powerful and useful.     My desk mirror I intended on replacing (a Clairol), is 25 years old and have not had to replace the lights, yet. (knock on wood) I suppose as ugly and space consuming as it is, I should stick with what still works and forget esthetics.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror.  It is exactly what I had been looking for. The magnigication is excellent and it has 3 different light settings.  The only small negative aspect is that the touch for the light settings is ultra sensitive and I will touch by mistake and turn the light off. Not really a big deal though.  Great product.</li>
    <li> i work for a cosmetics company where my face has to look flawless down to the smallest detail everyday and i could never really achieve that with a regular mirror, but with the triple magnification mirror i spend less time working on my makeup and can see exactly what i&#x27;m doing.  the lighting is good and the 10x mag. is great for tweezing eyebrows.  love it.</li>
    <li> I like the clean, elegant design and heavy, solid feel of this mirror.  It looks nice on my bathroom counter.  The three magnifications give it extra versatility -- great for putting on makeup, or for situations where you need extra close visibility, like getting a lash out of your eye (which happened to me just recently, and the high magnification inset made removing the offending object easier than ever).      Although there are three levels of brightness provided by the built in illumination, they range from dim to really dim, unlike my previous 60s-era mirror that lit up the entire house and was probably visible from space.  I rely on ambient lighting-assist with my new mirror.    The on/off and brightness levels are controlled by tapping the base, which is fast and easy, almost too easy as it is common to touch it accidentally.  I&#x27;m getting used to quickly tapping the base three times to get back to where I was when this happens.     Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this lovely, versatile mirror. The built-in light could be a little brighter, but it looks great, and it&#x27;s got the magnification requirements well covered.</li>
    <li> This mirror is great to use for makeup although the lighting isnt bright enough. The magnification is great for plucking eyebrows! After using this mirror with the magnification, I noticed that my eyebrows were definitely nicer because I could see all the strays! The light will enhance makeup application if you have lighting that is already so-so. If you don&#x27;t, you&#x27;ll need an additional light source. Other than that, this is a great product.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror for my bathroom, because of it&#x27;s longish design, it doesn&#x27;t take too much space on my counter. The touch control is great as well as the bottom extra magnifying part. I&#x27;ve had this for about two months now and it&#x27;s still working great. It&#x27;s wonderful for applying make-up and tweezing.</li>
    <li> I ORDERED THIS MIRROR BECAUSE IT HAD SUCH GOOD REVIEWS WELL MINE CAME YESTERDAY AND I DID NOT LIKE IT. THE MIRROR HAD THE SMALL MAGNIFICATION MIRROR ON IT BUT THIS SMALL MIRROR IS ON THE SIDE THAT IS THE NORMAL SIDE NOT THE BIG SIDE. WHEN I WENT TO USE THE NORMAL SIDE OF THE MIRROR TO PUT ON MAKEUP THIS SMALL MAGNIFICATION MIRROR WAS IN MY WAY IT ALMOST MADE ME DIZZY THE SMALL MIRROR IS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BOTTOM OF THE MIRROR AND LOOKS LIKE IT WOULD BE OUT OT THE WAY BUT IT WASN&#x27;T. THEY SHOULDN&#x27;T HAVE PUT  THIS SMALL MIRROR ON THE NORMAL SIDE I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT MIRROR IF THIS SMALL MAGNIFICATION MIRROR HAD BEEN ON THE SIDE WITH THE BIG MAGINGICATION MIRROR THEN YOU WOULD HAVE THE WHOLE SIDE FOR PUTTING ON MAKEUP AND THE OTHER SIDE WHEN YOU NEEDED IT FOR SOMETHING YOU REALY NEEDED TO DO UP CLOSE. I STARTED NOT TO WRITE THIS BECAUSE ALL THE OTHER REVIEWS WERE SO GOOD ON THIS MIRROR BUT I FELT LIKE PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW THAT THIS DOESNT WORK FOR EVERYONE. I SHOWED IT TO MY DAUGHTER AND DIDN&#x27;T TELL HER THE WAY I FELT ABOUT IT AND SHE SAID THIS LITTLE MIRROR WOULD BE IN MY WAY AND WOULD DRIVE ME CRAZY. I AM GOING TO SEND THIS BACK AND ORDER ONE THAT HAS THE PLAIN MIRROR ON ONE SIDE AND THE MAGINGICATION MIRROR ON THE OTHER SIDE WITH NO SMALL MIRROR.</li>
    <li> Given as a gift to my mother but she loves the mirror. Likes how you touch the base for the different light levels although you can accidentally touch the base applying make up. For the price, it&#x27;s a nice mirror.</li>
    <li> This is a great product...everything I wanted in a makeup mirror...received in record time in excellant condition...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good mirror when there&#x27;s not good place to have a wall mirror. This works great for area that&#x27;s dimly lit in the corner of the bedroom.</li>
    <li> My Wife has been searching brick and mortar stores for about a year for a good mirror to help with her makeup application. All were either too cheap or too expensive. After searching thru the extensive Amazon mirror selection I settled on the Infiniti by Conair BE86. She is very happy with all aspects of this one. Quality of the delivered product was excellent: nice heavy chrome surface, touch type 3 position lighting power adjustment and good quality, clear mirrors (plain, 10X and spot). Her only complaint is due to our bathroom layout, not the mirror. Namely, we had no room at a convenient location for a wall mounted type so she has to bend over to get the right distance from the mirror. We may experiment with a stand of some kind to set the mirror pedestal upon.</li>
    <li> Yes, this one&#x27;s more expensive than the other Conair mirrors. But the oval design and adjustable lighting makes it a worthwhile investment. The 10X spot magnification is a brilliant addition that every woman with impeccable grooming expectations would need !!</li>
    <li> I used to have a Revlon mirror, which worked great.  I bought this Conair mirror because it was more stylish (polished chrome compared to my plastic Revlon mirror).  Unfortunately even the brightest setting on this mirror is not as bright as I desire.  Secondly, every time I bump the base, it turns the light off!  I wish that I would have stuck with my Revlon.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror 6 month ago.  All was fine until tonight.  The cord at the base of the mirror stand broke and shorted out causing a lot of sparks and dropped the breaker in the house.  The electrical cord is very stiff and brittle after 6 months.  Avoid this mirror!</li>
    <li> This mirror functions very well if it is located in a good natural source of light.  The light on the mirror itself is just so so.  I have it near a window, so am satisfied, but I wouldn&#x27;t be if I had to depend to the mirror&#x27;s light.  I really like the oval shape and the magnification.</li>
    <li> Great item and very pleased with the product and service. Would buy from them again.&lt;br /&gt;Love this mirror. So nice to be able to see what I&#x27;m doing now.lol The light didn&#x27;t work whe</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my mom.  She says it&#x27;s great and really likes the built in extra magnification spot.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now and it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for. I didn&#x27;t want to spend much more than $20, and you would never guess it cost so little based on the appearance - it is sturdy and made from great quality materials. The light has 3 strength levels but I only ever use it on high. It&#x27;s not bright enough to use in a pitch-dark room, but if you have any other lighting in the room, it should be fine (my room is a cave and it&#x27;s still bright enough). I like the fact that it has two sides and both are lighted. The regular side is perfect for applying makeup, while the magnified side is great for plucking your eyebrows or other tasks that require a close-up view.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is the the touch sensor on the base. I&#x27;m always accidentally brushing against it and turning it off, which can get annoying. That&#x27;s the only reason why I&#x27;m rating this a 4 and not a 5.</li>
    <li> I looked a long time both in stores and online for a magnification mirror that would work for me.  I wanted one tall enough so I didn&#x27;t have to bend over to look into it--got it.  I wanted quality--got it, I wanted versatility (three different magnifications)--got it, and I especially wanted it to be bright enough to be useful--got it.  And it looks really nice on my bathroom counter.  You will love the oval shape.  This is one of the better products of its kind on the market.  Can&#x27;t go wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE!  It is now August 2013 and I am still using this magnification mirror, no problems with it ever, so everything I said before still applies.</li>
    <li> This is a solid make-up mirror for the price - nice size, shape, 3-level lighting, and magnification.  The ultra-magnification spot on the one side is perfect for a close-up view of an eye (or whatever)....  From an aesthetic standpoint, I&#x27;m not a fan of the pock-marks on the base - they really don&#x27;t add anything; but that&#x27;s minor.  My one real gripe with this mirror is that the light frequently (maybe twice a week or so?)goes on by itself!  I initially blamed my husband and my kids - and then it happened when they weren&#x27;t around - and I hadn&#x27;t gone near the mirror.  Not a big deal, but of course the bulb life won&#x27;t be as long (and it&#x27;s annoying to see that light coming from the bathroom in the middle of the night - somehow it always happens at night - or maybe that&#x27;s just when I actually notice it - and to have to drag myself out of bed to turn it off.</li>
    <li> The lighting could be a little brighter, but it is a nice mirror with good magnification.</li>
    <li> The lighting is poor, and with the touch on base, I accidently turn it off all of the time.  The magnification is good, and if you hold it up to natural light, it does the job.  Definately not the old Lady Clarol mirror with the bright lights.</li>
    <li> Seems like a very good product.  Does not feel cheap.  Wife seems to like her present.  Light is excellent.</li>
