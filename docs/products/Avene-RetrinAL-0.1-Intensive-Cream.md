      <li>Thanks again!</li>
      <li>There are certainly much pricier products that can&#x27;t make that claim!</li>
      <li>I first bought it at the recommendation of my dermatolgist.</li>
      <li>I have used Retinal creams [various brands] for many years and although I did see an improvement in my skin with all of the other brands, I&#x27;ve seen the most benefit with the Avene brand.</li>
      <li>It does really help my skin.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t seen much change in my skin.  </li>

      <li>very beneficial product.</li>

      <li>others have pointed out, do apply this cream to clean damp/dry skin and only at night.</li>
      <li>Pores seems to be smaller, and the overall appearance of my skin looks better.</li>
      <li>From my personal experience I recommend it, and there seems there&#x27;s some actual science showing a true benefit to the skin.</li>
      <li>quick delivery and product as expected.  </li>
      <li>It truly diminishes the little fine lines around the eyes .  </li>
      <li>I was told by my dermatologist to use this product on my 57 year old face.</li>

      <li>I have surprisingly young looking skin at 48 despite my youth being in the sun</li>
      <li>I generally love these creams, and I&#x27;ve tried different ones in the past..</li>
      <li>I noticed fine lines disappearing  after only a few weeks of using this product.  </li>
      <li>It is gentle enough to not cause any redness or drying even with daily use.</li>
      <li>No imitation.</li>
      <li>It is reasonably priced, when compared to other &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; end creams.</li>
      <li>Even when it gets down to hardly anything in it, I manage to be able to still squeeze another day&#x27;s use out of it.</li>

      <li>a very sensitive skin and fist started to use it every other day and after a month or so, daily.  </li>

<li> The price is a little high</li>
<li> I was told this product would plump out wrinkles under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps there has been some minor change after 6 months of daily application, but not sufficient enough to keep me from exploring other remedies.&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> quick delivery and product as expected.  Perfect.  No imitation.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much change in my skin.  I am using it faithfully for about six weeks, along with physician&#x27;s subscribed skin whitening.  I will keep trying until the tube is empty, but if nothing changes, I probably will not continue.</li>
    <li> Amazing product, works as advertised, doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, and really makes a visible difference in fine lines!</li>
    <li> Went through 2 tubes. Saw absolutely no difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using Avene Retrinal for about two years now, absolutely love it.  I have a very sensitive skin and fist started to use it every other day and after a month or so, daily.  Do not go in the sun when you have it on, it&#x27;s strictly a night cream. A little expensive but it goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This product works well to open the pores on your skin. My skin looks shiny and clean. Price is much better than if I purchase from a professional person.</li>
    <li> Recommended to me by my dermatology group - facial care section.  Thanks to Amazon, I can purchase it more reasonably.  As previous reviewers have said this product goes a long way.  Use a pea size nightly and apply portions of this pea size to each cheek and lower forehead above the eyes.  It does brighten up the look of the skin and gives a nice smoother look to your face. I think it is a very good product.  I am decades past when I was 20 but I feel good about my skin and taking care of it.</li>
    <li> I have noticed that my skin has gradually improved in terms of fine lines since using this product every night.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like are the stains on my pillowcases.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by a plastic surgeons dermatologist. I love it.  It works.  It&#x27;s gentle and effective.  I will use nothing else but AVENE.. I started with 0.5.  I am now using plus 0.l  I&#x27;ve had no adverse reactions with this wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I noticed fine lines disappearing  after only a few weeks of using this product.  I will keep using it as part of my daily regimen. It is gentle enough to not cause any redness or drying even with daily use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Maxi-peel in the past and had INCREDIBLE results.. so, I thought this is a bit higher,.1 vs .025 and thought I would give it a try. There was no visible flaking in the week I used it, I usually see some flaking within 3 days with the Maxi-peel. There&#x27;s no skin irritation, no drying, there&#x27;s nothing that I could see. Overall, very disappointed. I generally love these creams, and I&#x27;ve tried different ones in the past.. this is by far the worst. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s just say when I run out, I notice.  This product truly brightens the skin and evens our skin tone.  I really love it!</li>
    <li> I used this cream before and when I ran low I reordered. It works well.most people think my slin looks younger than you&#x27;d expect formy age.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t see much difference.  Wrinkles still there, but they are less noticable. The price is a little high and you don&#x27;t get much product for your money.</li>
    <li> I love this brand, &amp;#34;Retinal&amp;#34;! 1st received from Dermatalogist and have used it many years now!  Thank you for selling it and more reasonable at that.  Thanks again! Will order it again!!!</li>
    <li> i live for avene , best products out there</li>
    <li> recommended by dermatologists and sold in their offices.  great procuct. a little goes a long way</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products I have tried.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  It truly diminishes the little fine lines around the eyes .  It also seems to brighen up my entire face.  I only use it at night before I go to bed.  But be careful with your pillow case because it will turn it a little yellow/orange.  But it&#x27;s totally worth it1</li>
    <li> Hasn&#x27;t worked as well other retinal products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Avene Retrinal + 0.1 Cream - 30ml/1.01oz&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this cream for my wife and I know that she loves the product.</li>
    <li> I had tried this once before and liked it,  so I ordered another.  It does really help my skin.  Pores seems to be smaller, and the overall appearance of my skin looks better.</li>
    <li> Not sure I am crazy about this product.  My face peels easily and I&#x27;ve had to lay off the stuff even though I only used a little each night.  I could not see much diminishment in fine lines and wrinkles, but I will try it again.</li>
    <li> My Dermatologist recommended this to me and I really like it!!  I order it online now as opposed to buying in the doctor&#x27;s office:)  It&#x27;s cheaper online.  It goes a long way.  Even when it gets down to hardly anything in it, I manage to be able to still squeeze another day&#x27;s use out of it.</li>
    <li> Hard to tell what it&#x27;s doing right now. Use at night every night with no problem. Seen no visible results</li>
    <li> Good anti-aging cream. I started using it in my mid 50&#x27;s. Now 63 and still look good. I have to use it almost nightly.</li>
    <li> the product was great and so was the price.</li>
    <li> helps keep skin smooth and wrinkle free. Easy to use, non irritating. A litle goes a long way. Non greasy, no fragrance</li>
    <li> I have used this for 4 years. I first bought it at the recommendation of my dermatolgist. She sells it in her office for more money. It worked so well I have continued to use it. A tube lasts months. I really notice the difference when I use it. I have surprisingly young looking skin at 48 despite my youth being in the sun and I think this really helps.</li>
    <li> Love this cream! It works wonderfully for my wrinkles and skin. A bit expensive but worth it!</li>
    <li> great product removes fine lines and acne  leave skin smooth and soft got product within 3 days</li>
    <li> I have used Retinal creams [various brands] for many years and although I did see an improvement in my skin with all of the other brands, I&#x27;ve seen the most benefit with the Avene brand. It is reasonably priced, when compared to other &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; end creams. I have thin, sensitive skin and am 65 years old. I&#x27;ve been using Avene for about 2 years now and have not experienced any redness or dryness while using it. My routine is Vit C serum in the morning and Avene at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have pointed out, do apply this cream to clean damp/dry skin and only at night.</li>
    <li> No cream is perfect, but so far this is the best one I have used. It gives me a nice glow and I&#x27;m 74 years old.</li>
    <li> I was told this product would plump out wrinkles under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps there has been some minor change after 6 months of daily application, but not sufficient enough to keep me from exploring other remedies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would welcome suggestions of products to try from others who have had this aging problem.</li>
    <li> I learned about this product from a dermatologist -works great!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It&#x27;s very simple to use and it keeps my skin smooth and even looking.  It takes away fine lines.  I put a very small amount under my eyes and it even eliminates the milea that has a tendency to  build up there due to makeup.  I just won&#x27;t be without this cream!</li>
    <li> I was told by my dermatologist to use this product on my 57 year old face. I had been getting small skin tags. since using this product I have not had any more.  A bit pricey, but worth it.</li>
    <li> This product I have found to be better than Stri vectin.  my skin doctor recommended it , I love it.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended Avene Retrinal several years ago and I&#x27;ve used it ever since.  I love what it does for my skin. My skin breaks out with almost everything, but not this. Also I have rosacea and it has improved. It seems to help with sun damage,too.    I wanted to find out the difference between the 0.1% and the 0.1%+ pre-tocopheryl (this product) because of the price difference,and I found this research study abstract from what looks like a reputable journal. It shows the pre-tocopheryl does add benefits: [...]  It is obvious that the 2 substances compared were Retrinal 0.05% and 0.05%+, the Avene active ingredients. Did the company fund it? I have no idea, but there was enough of a difference that the study was published.I think this would apply to the 0.1% as well.    It also showed that both products help the skin make collagen , which is important because skin thins as it ages.    From my personal experience I recommend it, and there seems there&#x27;s some actual science showing a true benefit to the skin. There are certainly much pricier products that can&#x27;t make that claim!</li>
    <li> very beneficial product.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Leaves your skin looking beautiful with out all the drying of Rx retina but much more effective than over the counter products.  The seller sold this or much less than I have purchased in a spa. Timely arrival too.  Will buy many more times.  Also this product lasts because you only need a small amount each time.  I started out using the .005 then after a year of use moved up to the .1 cream.  If you have sensitive skin you might want to start out using this every other night until you build up.</li>
    <li> Recommended by dermatologist... great product!</li>
    <li> This product arrived in an envelope. An envelope! It was open, muddy, and it looked like someone had stepped on it. There was no protective seal over it and I am scared to use it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this every day for three weeks and no difference at all. I have used retinal cream before but I think this one has .0001% potency.</li>
    <li> I had to stop using as I had a procedure done, but I am starting it again but I do love it. It is a great product and I will continue using it.</li>
</ol>
