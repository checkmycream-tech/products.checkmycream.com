      <li>and I am sure I&#x27;ll be purchasing a few more for some special ladies in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This brush is super cute, I love how it&#x27;s so compact and comes with a little mirror.</li>
      <li>Just glides right through my hair.</li>
      <li>Get through my coarse hair texture easily and smoothly.</li>
      <li>every morning I let her to hold the mirror(remember to peel the plastic membrane off the mirror before you use : ) ) and the brush combs her hair  very nicely without a tiny little bit hurt at all.</li>

      <li>, it is less than 10 bucks, reviews looked good, so I ordered it Friday noon time.</li>

      <li>I have medium length hair that can get pretty gnarly and this brush helped detangle even while went.</li>
      <li>I am glad that this brush finally works.</li>
      <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t love is the cover.</li>
      <li>I love its stylish design which combines the brush, mirror and a small handle.</li>
      <li>This one having bristles that aren&#x27;t metal had me thinking that I could give Molly a good brushing without being too harsh.  </li>

      <li>I have very short hair and just need something to put my hair back in place, and this brush is perfect because I don&#x27;t need a round brush for curling or styling.  </li>

      <li>LOVE this little brush!</li>
      <li>I did not realize this tiny little item works so magically.</li>

      <li>She was thrilled that it has a &#x27;secret compartment&#x27; for hair bands and pins.</li>
      <li>It helps me get through my fine, past my waist length hair.</li>
      <li>You can fit bobby pins, hair ties or small pop clips inside.</li>
      <li>I was a little skeptical at first since my hair is fine and very tangled and no other brush really worked</li>
      <li>, so does my 3 and half old girl, we both have very fine hair, and her hair usually got tangled after rolling in bed all night</li>
      <li>My hubby was amazed: The shipping itself usually will cost that much for that fast delivery already!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have VERY thick hair that easily gets tangled, especially when staying outside</li>

<li> I have VERY thick hair that easily gets tangled, especially when staying outside</li>
<li> This is my new everyday brush</li>
<li> This is what I have been looking for, as got used to use a comb with handle, as I have quite long hair.</li>
<li> She&#x60;s been dealing with the tangling problems because she had a long think hair.</li>
<li> It definitely gets the knots out and can be used at either wet or dry hair.</li>
<li> I have an 85 lb Golden Retriever mix who sheds horribly, and I&#x27;ve tried many brushes to keep up with it.  </li>
<li> I get serious tangles that I spend way too much time carefully de-tangling.</li>
<li> Sometime she was playing by putting different color of rubber band in the little drawer/handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> brush seems to be holding up well and the bristles are just enough to get through her hair but not so stiff that it hurts.</li>
<li> I have thick, wavy hair, and the brush bristles are long enough to brush through my hair.</li>
<li> with my thin hair, this is the only brush that doesn&#x27;t cause massive breakage!</li>
<li> only problem was that the mirror that it came with was a bit dull and scratched ):</li>
<li> My only complaint is the mirror was scratched up when I got it.</li>
<li> Not like the real wet brush.  </li>
<li> She loves holding it in one hand without the handle and sweeping it down all over.</li>
<li> Seriously, that is the smartest thing you could possibly do!</li>
<li> I have wicked thick long hair</li>
<li> The handle slides out to reveal a little hidden compartment you can keep bobby pins and little hair ties in!</li>
<li> No problems or crying.</li>
<li> The first day we used it, she had very difficult tangles.</li>
<li> I was not sure what to expect with this brush in terms of size and packaging.</li>
<li> It also has a small compartment that slides out with two hair ties included.  </li>
<li> No more digging through my purse looking for a hair tie.  </li>
<li> /&gt;This isn&#x27;t just a brush, but also a mirror and features a small hidden drawer for your hair ties!!  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s sometimes hard to snap on without the bristles getting in the way.</li>
<li> I was afraid it might be not easy to grip.</li>
<li> but when she gets out of the lake it looks horrible and is really hard to comb thru.</li>

    <li> This comb is portable and has a teeth protective cover, just put it your bad, never worry about the teeth damage. A good partner for travelling. I have recommanded this one to my colleagues.</li>

    <li> Amazing brush. Just glides right through my hair. I was a little skeptical at first since my hair is fine and very tangled and no other brush really worked but this one is a keeper.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem was that the mirror that it came with was a bit dull and scratched ):</li>
    <li> Larger than I expected but all in all it is a good purchase</li>

    <li> Just got my brush. I like the brush it&#x60;s really cute. It helps me get through my fine, past my waist length hair. I get serious tangles that I spend way too much time carefully de-tangling.</li>
    <li> This is the cutest, most convenient portable travel brush I have ever had! I love how easy it is to store it in my purse or travel bag. It closes so the bristles aren&#x27;t getting caught on things in my purse. It includes a nice little mirror on the inside so you can make sure your hair is looking fabulous while you&#x27;re out and about. It&#x27;s easy to hold, doesn&#x27;t tug and pull at my hair, and it&#x27;s easy to clean. The handle slides out to reveal a little hidden compartment you can keep bobby pins and little hair ties in! Seriously, that is the smartest thing you could possibly do! No more digging through my purse looking for a hair tie.  I love how sleek and stylish this brush looks. I absolutely love it! *sample provided for testing and review*</li>
    <li> The brush is great. Takes out tangles without pulling. I use in my hair and my curly haired toddler. No problems or crying. The only thing I don&#x27;t love is the cover. It&#x27;s sometimes hard to snap on without the bristles getting in the way.</li>
    <li> It is so good.&lt;br /&gt;And the brush do not hurt.</li>
    <li> What a super innovative idea!!  I love products that carry double uses and this product actually is a 3 in 1!!!  Saving space and keeping items that you often use together, all in one place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t just a brush, but also a mirror and features a small hidden drawer for your hair ties!!  Now, I had problems getting 1 of the 2 included hair ties back inside, but I can easily put another hair tie in its place. Whomever came up with this idea, was truly thinking about the needs of the people who would use this. A mirror, brush and hair ties are all products that work together and so this was a brilliant idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush itself is a nice and sturdy brush, the hair ties (2) are also nice and the mirror is just the right size. Overall, I&#x27;m really impressed with this novel concept.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**. Sample Provided for Testing &amp; Review</li>
    <li> LOVE this little brush! It fits right into my purse! The bristles are plastic and it has a cover that comes off with a mirror inside! It also has a small compartment that slides out with two hair ties included.  You can fit bobby pins, hair ties or small pop clips inside. Great travel brush, especially for  the beach! *sample provided for review*</li>
    <li> She&#x60;s been dealing with the tangling problems because she had a long think hair. One thing I like most is that it can easily brush the hair without some significant breakage of existing hairs. So yes, five stars!</li>
    <li> It definitely gets the knots out and can be used at either wet or dry hair. I am happy with its solid design and the beautiful color plus the price is reasonable.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this brush. She has long and easily tangled hair. It often looks like a rat&#x27;s nest and she hates brushing it. Except now she doesn&#x27;t mind. She loves holding it in one hand without the handle and sweeping it down all over. She was thrilled that it has a &#x27;secret compartment&#x27; for hair bands and pins. And it&#x27;s great that the handle tucks away if you don&#x27;t want to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush seems to be holding up well and the bristles are just enough to get through her hair but not so stiff that it hurts. Sample provided for review.</li>
    <li> with my thin hair, this is the only brush that doesn&#x27;t cause massive breakage! love it, and great to throw in your purse for on the go!</li>
    <li> Soft, and feel very comfortable. Get through my coarse hair texture easily and smoothly. I did not realize this tiny little item works so magically. Recommanded to people get headache of tangling.</li>
    <li> This brush is super cute, I love how it&#x27;s so compact and comes with a little mirror. I have medium length hair that can get pretty gnarly and this brush helped detangle even while went. The little storage compartment for hair ties is even more adorable than I even though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**sample provided for testing purposes**</li>
    <li> This brush has it all! I couldn&#x27;t believe when I opened it up and not only found a mirror, but realized there was a pull out handle AND 2 hair ties. I have wicked thick long hair and I&#x27;m constantly fighting with knots. I was blown away when I got out of the shower and didn&#x27;t have to rip through my hair trying to get the knots out. I love that when you open the brush you can brush your hair AND look at a mirror at the same time. The hair ties were the biggest bonus. I&#x27;m constantly losing them or running out. Now I&#x27;ll always have a stash in my brush. This is my new everyday brush and I am sure I&#x27;ll be purchasing a few more for some special ladies in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
    <li> i got this for my daughter. she has such beautiful hair but when she gets out of the lake it looks horrible and is really hard to comb thru. with this brush its easy. i would buy this agian</li>
    <li> I bought this brush for myself because I always forget to put a brush in my purse and end up running errands in town with the wind-blown look.  I have very short hair and just need something to put my hair back in place, and this brush is perfect because I don&#x27;t need a round brush for curling or styling.  I love that it has a cover so that it won&#x27;t tangle in things in my purse, and that there is a mirror inside the cover too, which is great not only to see what I&#x27;m doing with my hair, but for a quick touch up of lip gloss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I realized that the bristles on this brush were plastic, I had an &#x27;a-ha&#x27; moment ... dog brush!  I have an 85 lb Golden Retriever mix who sheds horribly, and I&#x27;ve tried many brushes to keep up with it.  This one having bristles that aren&#x27;t metal had me thinking that I could give Molly a good brushing without being too harsh.  They&#x27;re plastic, but the tips are still sharp, so it works out great.  Molly gets brushed a couple of times a day and still the hair is never-ending,  and you can see from the photo how much hair is in this brush after just a few swipes.  She loved it, and stretched out so that I could do her belly with it.  The dog hair cleaned off easily with my fingers, and I didn&#x27;t have to beat it against the fence outside like I do with one of her other brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I debated on whether I should mention that I&#x27;d used this brush on my dog, but when I logged in to leave my review, I read the product description again and see that they did mention you could use it on your dog too, so I guess I&#x27;m not the only one who had that idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to purchase this brush at a discount in exchange for an honest review, and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve given it.  Human hairbrush or for your dog, this is a great little brush!</li>
    <li> I was not sure what to expect with this brush in terms of size and packaging. I must say this is an excellent brush for a traveler or those who need an extra brush in their purse or car. I love that it comes with a sturdy plastic case. The brush stays in my car console but the sturdy case protects it from any damage. It also keeps the brush and bristles clean – I can grab it any time for a quick touch up.&lt;br /&gt;The bottom part of the case has a mirror. Again, a huge plus for anyone traveling. I can brush and touch up my hair quick, even if I am in the middle of a busy day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush itself is sturdy and its curved shape fits perfectly in the palm of my hand. I have thick, wavy hair, and the brush bristles are long enough to brush through my hair. I’ve mentioned the case itself is sturdy but the bristles are also well made. The plastic bristles are washable and easy to keep clean. Its shape is designed to detangle, which it does effectively. I received a complimentary brush, which I really needed for travel and convenience, but honest opinions are all my own.</li>
    <li> lots of this type of brush on amazon, while I just bought this one as it holds a sliding handle inside. This is what I have been looking for, as got used to use a comb with handle, as I have quite long hair. I was afraid it might be not easy to grip. This one comes and releases my concerns and can works for the tangled hair.</li>
    <li> It gets the tangles out of my hair and fits in my purse nicely. My only complaint is the mirror was scratched up when I got it.</li>
