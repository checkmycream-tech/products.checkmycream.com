      <li>They are heftier and work perfectly for me.</li>
      <li>Thank you Amazon for having an excellent return policy.</li>
      <li>AWESOME!</li>
      <li>They are a great price.</li>
      <li>Great length...</li>
      <li>However, it looks like Goody has greatly improved them.</li>
      <li>The 6-pack from Amazon is a great deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>These are very nice bobby pins and they have a protective rubber tip so they do not scratch your scalp.  </li>
      <li>Kind of  sixtyish, but it worked then and it works now!</li>
      <li>Just a perfect size for baby fine hair.</li>
      <li>but Goody makes a good inexpensive hair gadget.</li>
      <li>package is a good value.</li>
      <li>Bobby pins are not that good.</li>
      <li>I love these things!</li>
      <li>I love these Bobby pins!</li>
      <li>Honestly, I can even skip putting my hair in an elastic if I&#x27;m not planning on running a marathon or anything.</li>
      <li>Very good old fashioned good hair clips.</li>
      <li>The perfect length for the soft lock hair rollers.</li>
      <li>better quality than the bucket that we got two years ago.</li>
      <li>many uses for my arthridic fingers.  </li>
      <li>Newer design not always better.</li>
      <li>However, they are the best bobby pins I have found in several years.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
      <li>Long bobby pins are wonderful for this and</li>
      <li>/&gt;It takes twice as many to hold my hair, because pins bend easily and are just flimsy.</li>
      <li>They are strong, they hold.</li>
      <li>Cannot believe I am longing for the good old days!</li>
      <li>I WAS EXCITED WHEN I SAW THE PIX.</li>
      <li>I still make pincurls as well as use wigs and the extra length comes in handy for me.</li>
      <li>Still useful, if needed.</li>
      <li>They slip right out.</li>
      <li>These are nice fold holding back large strands of hair since they are bigger than most bobby pins.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re extra long so they can hold more hair, more</li>
      <li>These are the best quality ones which have been getting hard to find in my local drugstores, don&#x27;t know why.  </li>
      <li>I have really long ,fine hair and have ways used regular pins , these are far superior in my opinion.</li>
      <li>Delighted to finally find these brown long bobby pins.</li>
      <li>They are not even strong enough for holding pin curls.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just a large pack of roller pins, just like you find at the drugstore.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t find these large bobby pins in the stores anymore.  </li>
      <li>I can use about 4 of these pins to put my hair up in a nice, tight, chic topknot/ballerina bun.</li>
      <li>really disappointed!&lt;br</li>
      <li>Whatever happened to heavy-duty bobby pins that stay more firmly in one&#x27;s hair?&lt;br /&gt;They get lighter all the time!</li>
      <li>I have been searching for several years for the old, strong, long bobby pins that I had used for years and years.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t find LARGE bobby pins anywhere (to hold my long hair in a bun), so I bought these, but didn&#x27;t realize I was purchasing 6 packages of them.  </li>
      <li>ordered the same product number as others I had purchased, that is why I really thought would be same sturdy</li>
      <li>When I roll my hair, to get a finished, smooth full of body hair &amp;#34; do&amp;#34;, you attach each roller to the previous one with one of these nifty little bobby pins,.dry, and comb out when dry.  </li>
      <li>These bobby pins came with barely any cushion on the tips!</li>
      <li>I have used bobby pins for a few years to pin my wet curls up till they dry to keep the curl better.</li>
      <li>I have long hair that I frequently wear up in french twists and buns.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was hoping this was the big bobby pins without the hump on it.  The pic didn&#x27;t show it so I got this.  Might not be a problem for anyone else, but not what I was hoping for</li>
    <li> These bobby pins came with barely any cushion on the tips!</li>
    <li> Very good old fashioned good hair clips.</li>
    <li> I was going to use these with my 70&#x27;s steam curlers (no clips). But it just didn&#x27;t hold the curler, because of the pins curved shape. BUT I decided to see if it would hold my hair in a bun. I twisted my hair (layered and long) and put the pin in, going from top to bottom.  I have very thick hair, and one of these has so far held the hair in the bun!  I&#x27;ve whipped my head back and forth and it still held! And it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;pinching&amp;#34; or jabbing the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;I WOULD recommend this item.</li>
    <li> Has hump in middle &amp; not as heavy gauge as my older ones. Newer design not always better.</li>
    <li> these do work some what..they are NOT what I thought they were</li>
    <li> Just a perfect size for baby fine hair.</li>
    <li> I love these things! I have really long ,fine hair and have ways used regular pins , these are far superior in my opinion. They are heftier and work perfectly for me. They dont blend into my hair as well as regular ones (as I mentioned they are bulkier )</li>
    <li> These are ROLLER PINS not Bobby Pins. As soon as I pulled one off of the cardboard I immediately put it back and returned it. The package even says roller pins. Thank you Amazon for having an excellent return policy.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair. Like really thick hair. So thick that when my hair is in a bun it looks like my bun is about to swallow my entire head. Enter Goody Styling Essential Bobby Pins. I can use about 4 of these pins to put my hair up in a nice, tight, chic topknot/ballerina bun. Honestly, I can even skip putting my hair in an elastic if I&#x27;m not planning on running a marathon or anything. There is no way I could do that with standard bobby pins. NO WAY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other pros:&lt;br /&gt;*** I can reuse these bobby pins for ages. AWESOME! They don&#x27;t bend, break or anything.&lt;br /&gt;*** They&#x27;re extra long so they can hold more hair, more securely.&lt;br /&gt;*** The 6-pack from Amazon is a great deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy these. Never look back.</li>
    <li> When I roll my hair, to get a finished, smooth full of body hair &amp;#34; do&amp;#34;, you attach each roller to the previous one with one of these nifty little bobby pins,.dry, and comb out when dry.  Kind of  sixtyish, but it worked then and it works now!</li>
    <li> I love these Bobby pins! They are strong, they hold. I like the color. I just wish they came in silver!! I like the divot on one side so you can connect other pins to.</li>
    <li> These bobby pins are not strong enough for holding thick hair , neither are they strong enough for holding long hair in a bun .  They are not even strong enough for holding pin curls.  Sorry.</li>
    <li> Too flimsy. Looking for a sturdier bobby pin.  Mine are a tiny bit wider and sturdy.  Any suggestions on how I might buy one?&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed. Sorry.&lt;br /&gt;Emily Marcus.</li>
    <li> Whatever happened to heavy-duty bobby pins that stay more firmly in one&#x27;s hair?&lt;br /&gt;They get lighter all the time!</li>
    <li> not as heavy as the ones from my youth, but they have a little notch in them that seems to help holding them in. better quality than the bucket that we got two years ago. A lot of pins and it came in time for stuffing stockings.</li>
    <li> CANT USE DUE TO MD DISEASE</li>
    <li> NOT heavy duty, very thin quality of metal, really disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the same product number as others I had purchased, that is why I really thought would be same sturdy pins.&lt;br /&gt;It takes twice as many to hold my hair, because pins bend easily and are just flimsy.</li>
    <li> I have long hair that I frequently wear up in french twists and buns.  Long bobby pins are wonderful for this and mean I only have to use a few, rather than many small ones.  I don&#x27;t know what it is about these, if the metal is too flexible or there aren&#x27;t enough bumps on the pins to create traction, but they just don&#x27;t stay in my hair.  They slip right out.</li>
    <li> What can one say about bobby pins? They work! The tips have a plastic coating so they don&#x27;t scratch your scalp. These are the large pins which I find easier to use than the small.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find LARGE bobby pins anywhere (to hold my long hair in a bun), so I bought these, but didn&#x27;t realize I was purchasing 6 packages of them.  Well.  No excuses for failed buns anymore.  Corny to say, but Goody makes a good inexpensive hair gadget.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the little things of life than can improve-or make difficult-the daily things we do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Example-the simple bobby pin. I have been searching for several years for the old, strong, long bobby pins that I had used for years and years. I have long, thick hair that I like to pin or style up. I also use the \\&quot;velcro\\&quot; type rollers that don&#x27;t stay in my hair without being pinned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad news is that these are not the old fashioned strong bobby pins I was hoping for. However, they are the best bobby pins I have found in several years. I was really getting tired of the long pins being bent out of shape if I pinned too much hair. They were useless afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These pins do have a \\&quot;bump\\&quot; on one side, just like the Goody pins I had bought before at the drugstore. However, it looks like Goody has greatly improved them. So give these from Amazon a try if you have been unhappy with a previous purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package is a good value. Cannot believe I am longing for the good old days!</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re roller pins, not bobby pins (i.e. flat and not curved).  I was hoping to get a set that were longer and could hold thick hair, but these were not it.  It&#x27;s just a large pack of roller pins, just like you find at the drugstore.</li>

    <li> These are very nice bobby pins and they have a protective rubber tip so they do not scratch your scalp.  they arrived within two days and there are one hundred snd eight of them.  thank you.</li>
    <li> Thin curve in middle I can&#x27;t put in my hair at all I am disabled and the pin criss cross overlap.&lt;br /&gt;Whoever invented these should be shot.</li>
    <li> The pins are thinner, not as sturdy. They twist when applying. Still useful, if needed. Very disappointed. I always look for the Goody brand.</li>
    <li> I WAS EXCITED WHEN I SAW THE PIX. I WAS LOOKING FOR THIS LENGTH. THE PROBLEM IS THE WEIGHT. THEY ARE FLEMSEY AND HAVE NO CUSHION WHEN YOU PUSH THEM INTO THE ROLLER TO HOLD IT IN PLACE.</li>
    <li> Really long like one per half of your head.  Works well for working out though.</li>
    <li> The perfect length for the soft lock hair rollers.</li>
    <li> These are nice fold holding back large strands of hair since they are bigger than most bobby pins.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find these large bobby pins in the stores anymore.  These are my old favorites that can&#x27;t be replaced by the little ones.  These should last for the duration.</li>
    <li> Delighted to finally find these brown long bobby pins. I&#x27;ve been looking in the stores for these for several years now, but could only find the black ones.</li>
    <li> Great length...many uses for my arthridic fingers.  I still make pincurls as well as use wigs and the extra length comes in handy for me.</li>
    <li> These are the best quality ones which have been getting hard to find in my local drugstores, don&#x27;t know why.  They are a great price.</li>
    <li> Bobby pins are not that good. Will keep for emergency only.</li>
