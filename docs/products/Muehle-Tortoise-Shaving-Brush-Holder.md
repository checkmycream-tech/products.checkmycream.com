      <li>IF it fit my husband&#x27;s shaving brush.</li>

      <li>It would fit most brushes I would assume, but we got the one from the same company.</li>
      <li>it is well worth the price because of</li>
      <li>I bought this hoping to use it for the smaller shaving brush that comes as part of a shaving kit, but it won&#x27;t work on that kind.</li>
      <li>and it looks pretty cool.</li>
      <li>Luckily, an older shaving brush I have will fit.  </li>
      <li>This holder looks exact as pictured,  I have a tweezerman shaving brush</li>
      <li>I bought this stand five years ago when I bought my first shaving brush.</li>
      <li>Bought this for my shaving brush from the art of shaving and it fits pretty well.  </li>
      <li>Doesnt fit most average sized shavign brushes</li>
      <li>Also be aware that the maker of this item is &amp;</li>
      <li>Maybe its just a defective one, but the top part is not angled properly and the brush keeps sliding off.</li>
      <li>Opening for brush much smaller than most shaving brush handles.</li>
      <li>It does exactly what i needed it to.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for</li>
      <li>Elegant and simply functional.</li>
      <li>The brush handle goes ABOVE the cutout, and the bristles hang below; you do not jam the handle into the cutout; the brush literally just sits on top of the holder.  </li>
      <li>I tried to force the brush into it and one of the prongs snapped right off,  I fixed it up with some super glue and duct tape</li>
      <li>For those of you apparently unfamiliar with this type of holder, it will fit any brushes with a 21mm knot.  </li>
      <li>Shave brush holder is top quality - these holders are made for the high quality badger brushes not the cheaper boar brushes with the larger knot.</li>
      <li>I use this brush holder with the SimplyBeautiful Basic 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush also available from Amazon.com.  </li>
      <li>but it is manufactured very well.  </li>
      <li>it probably wouldn&#x27;t take much to break it.</li>
      <li>It can be free standing, or attached with the sticky pad on the back or a screw.  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t bother me since the price was reasonable, but the quality reflects the price.</li>
      <li>This stand is tiny, not for a full size shaving brush.</li>
      <li>Also ordered a new shaving brush with this as well, BUT the new brush handle is too big to fit.  </li>
      <li>Highly Recommend this Stand for your brush</li>
      <li>(took only about half an hour or so) and now it works nice.</li>
      <li>Husband got a new shaving brush kit for a gift.</li>
      <li>Looks a little cheap- made out of plastic, but I have burnt orange in bathroom</li>
      <li>It is inexpensive, unobtrusive and has helped my wooden-handled shaving brush keep working half a decade after its original purchase.    </li>
      <li>highly recommended for the daily Shave Brush user.</li>
      <li>So if you think that your getting a real Mulhe holder, not so, Muehle is a different company that is appearing to look like the German Mulhe company.  </li>
      <li>Too short for even a  small shaving brush to fit on.  </li>
      <li>Go with the stainless steel, marble or other metal ones.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t look bad, easy to clean plastic-esqe surface.</li>
      <li>I still use it by leaning my brush into it (not hanging straight up and down).</li>
      <li>This shaving brush holder is far too small to hold a real shaving brush.</li>

    <li> Shave brush holder is top quality - these holders are made for the high quality badger brushes not the cheaper boar brushes with the larger knot.</li>
    <li> This little stand helps your shaving brush to last longer by hanging it with its bristles down. This helps the water to run off of the tips of the bristles and not collect at the base of the bristles, which can cause the glue to weaken and the bristles to fall out.    I bought this stand five years ago when I bought my first shaving brush. It is inexpensive, unobtrusive and has helped my wooden-handled shaving brush keep working half a decade after its original purchase.    That makes it a winner for me. Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This stand is definitely a \\&quot;no frills\\&quot; variety, however some of us seek simplicity. Very nice to look at, though. This stand is sturdy, and also came with a covered adhesive pad on the back should you choose to affix it to a wall. For a permanent fixation, the adhesive pad also covers a beveled hole where one could place a screw.</li>
    <li> I use this brush holder with the SimplyBeautiful Basic 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush also available from Amazon.com.  One thing to note is that this brush holder does not come with a suction cup mount, but rather just a sticky mounting pad.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very nice, and smaller than I thought it would be. It would fit most brushes I would assume, but we got the one from the same company. It has a sticker on the back so you can stick it to a wall or backsplash, but we have not done that. It just sits on the counter.</li>
    <li> The product is what it&#x27;s advertised to be.  It holds my shaving brush.  It&#x27;s sturdier than I expected and it hasn&#x27;t tipped over.  For a few bucks it&#x27;s what you want.  Especially if you are just starting with a shave brush and don&#x27;t want to invest $50 in a chrome or nickel plated holder.</li>
    <li> I thought I was getting the to wood one but turned out to be plastic.  It works but was not what I expected.</li>
    <li> Husband got a new shaving brush kit for a gift. It did&#x27;nt have a brush holder with it. This is cute and the brush fits into the slot perfectly, allowing the wet brush to dry straight.</li>
    <li> Read the measurements carefully, it was not big enough for the brush.</li>
    <li> Opening for brush much smaller than most shaving brush handles.</li>
    <li> Too small for brush from Art of Shaving.</li>
    <li> Based on the picture, I did not realize this was flimsy plastic. I assumed the low price was due to its small size. It holds the brush, but is not sturdy or attractive in person.</li>
    <li> I like the product I will buy again</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for</li>
    <li> Does what it should. Holds my brush so it can dry. Looks good on my counter too.</li>
    <li> Also ordered a new shaving brush with this as well, BUT the new brush handle is too big to fit.  Luckily, an older shaving brush I have will fit.  Glad it wasn&#x27;t very expensive.  If you order this, your shaving brush handle needs to be small.  It will not work for larger handles.</li>
    <li> The overall design is sturdy and would work well IF it fit my husband&#x27;s shaving brush. The handle of his shaving brush is standard size, but would not fit on this stand no matter how we  tried. Overall good product, just didn&#x27;t fit his brush.</li>
    <li> Maybe I didn&#x27;t look hard enough but this thing so short my Merkur doesn&#x27;t stand upright and it&#x27;s the shorty version of the razor</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, keep your brush down and drying out properly.</li>
    <li> Too short for even a  small shaving brush to fit on.  This product should not be sold to anyone.  Terrible product for what it is supposed to be.</li>
    <li> Great price for a stand for shaving brush.  bought 4 and have had no problems with them.</li>
    <li> It was smaller than expected.  Also did not realize it was suppose to attach to the wall.&lt;br /&gt;It is a piece of plastic that holds a brush</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, too small, even for my modest little Van Der Hagen brush</li>
    <li> The holder itself works fine. I&#x27;m giving it three stars because the adhesive that was used to keep it on the wall fell after only two days.</li>
    <li> Has a nice old school look to it, but would be better without the hole and sticky tape on the back(which I removed, since I wanted it to be free standing). I had to grind out the opening where the brush is held to allow it to go in properly. Dremel tool to the rescue. After that it does what it supposed to. Didn&#x27;t bother me since the price was reasonable, but the quality reflects the price.</li>
    <li> This brush stand is made out of thick plastic and has medium durability. I purchased it understanding that it would grip the brush at the bottom I was wrong. The stand is substantially shorter than I expected none the less it was a great purchase for the price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay....with modifications that include removing the suction cup and adding velcro, also adding duct tape to decrease the area that holds the brush.  Your brush may fit perfectly, mine did not as the opening was way to big.....my brush used in this holder is a Mulhe synthetic model# 33 K 252 - handle size 48mm X 36mm.  My advice.....get a holder that fits, in my case it would have been from Mulhe.  The material that this holder is made from appears to be tough enough.  You can also install this holder upside down if desired.  Also be aware that the maker of this item is &amp;#34;Muehle&amp;#34;....not Mulhe (German company).  So if you think that your getting a real Mulhe holder, not so, Muehle is a different company that is appearing to look like the German Mulhe company.  This product is fairly priced and worth the $7 asking price.</li>
    <li> its a shaving brush holder and it holds my shaving brush great. has a sticky on the back and also looks like it can be screwed to the wall.</li>
    <li> It didnt fit the brush i had. The holder is too small.</li>
    <li> This shaving brush holder is far too small to hold a real shaving brush. Not only is it too short to keep the brush suspended and off the base of the stand, but the slot that the brush handle is supposed to go into is too small to fit anything larger than a permanent marker.</li>
    <li> I loved it. Absolutely beautiful and elegant at a great price.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Doesn&#x27;t look bad, easy to clean plastic-esqe surface. It matches my wood and beach themed bathroom well, and I am looking into wall mounting it. It sits well on the sink surface without slippage, but I just want the space freed up.</li>
    <li> too small for my brush</li>
    <li> It looks great and gets the job done, you can set it on a counter or attach it to a wall. It looks classy and works perfectly.... Nuff said!</li>
    <li> Cheap Plastic and it didn&#x27;t fit either of my brushes unless I pushed them in really hard...and even then it felt as if the brush would pop out. Junk ..you get what you pay for. I just threw it in the trash and didn&#x27;t bother with the refund.</li>
    <li> Bought this to use with a Perfecto 100% badger brush, and it does work, it just doesn&#x27;t hold the brush by the handle.  Instead, I have to put the brush in at the point the the bristles enter the brush.  Not a big deal, just have to be careful not to bend the bristles.  For the price, it is a minor inconvenience.</li>
    <li> The brush holder works great. The adhesive sticks well but make sure the surface is clean before attaching to wall.</li>
    <li> As other people said, it was too small to hold my brush. I tried to force the brush into it and one of the prongs snapped right off,  I fixed it up with some super glue and duct tape (took only about half an hour or so) and now it works nice. It doesn&#x27;t look too great though. If you get it and it is too small, try snapping the prong off and putting a small piece of folded paper between the prong and base, it&#x27;ll add a bit of room between the prongs and will work. If you want something that&#x27;ll work out of the box, don&#x27;t buy this. If you don&#x27;t mind fiddling a little, then go for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*********UPDATE************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The duct tape and super glue started to wear off, my brush started to fall out of the holder. I bought a different holder and trashed this one. I don&#x27;t reccommend this product. If it does happen to fit your brush, then great, it is an attractive little holder.</li>
    <li> This shaving brush holder was broke when it arrived. I can tell it is cheaply made and even with better packaging it probably wouldn&#x27;t take much to break it. Do not buy. Go with the stainless steel, marble or other metal ones.</li>
    <li> This stand is tiny, not for a full size shaving brush. Maybe they make itty bitty brushes that you could use this for? I gave two stars because while plastic, the construction seems sturdy.</li>
    <li> Item is pictured sitting on a counter.  Brush does not fit in that orientation.  Holder is actually pictured upside down.  It must be attached to a wall or cabinet so the bristles can hang downward to dry.</li>
    <li> I have an ivory holder from both Muhle and Kent, and they work great for what they were intended.  For those of you apparently unfamiliar with this type of holder, it will fit any brushes with a 21mm knot.  And yes, it is correctly oriented in the picture.  The brush handle goes ABOVE the cutout, and the bristles hang below; you do not jam the handle into the cutout; the brush literally just sits on top of the holder.  It can be free standing, or attached with the sticky pad on the back or a screw.  Elegant and simply functional.</li>
    <li> Looks really nice but its really cheap plastic, and it broke within a couple weeks of my husband using it.  Cheap junk.</li>
    <li> Simple and looks good.</li>
    <li> It does exactly what i needed it to.  Holds my brush and keeps all the bristles from falling out. great.</li>
    <li> I am really pleased with this product.  For the price,  you can&#x27;t purchase a better product for the purpose that it&#x27;s intended for.  Another thing that,  I like about this product is,  it is made in Germany.  Most of all my shaving tools are made in Germany or USA.  This holder looks exact as pictured,  I have a tweezerman shaving brush and it fits this holder fine,  that is why I purchased this holder,  was for the tweezerman badger brush.    I am not disputing the other reviewer&#x27;s saying that, it does not fit his tweezerman brush.  Sometimes every item is not exact.  I am only speaking of,  this holder and tweezerman brush that I have.  This holder comes with a very good adhesive to put inside a cabinet or on the wall etc.  Believe it  or not,  this is NOT a cheap piece junk from china.  I do believe,  it is well worth the price because of it&#x27;s quality.</li>
    <li> works great for brush. Looks a little cheap- made out of plastic, but I have burnt orange in bathroom so it doesn&#x27; tlook that bad</li>
    <li> This little stand is just great for your shaving brush quick delivery on this product Highly Recommend this Stand for your brush</li>
    <li> strong, but the adhesive is good for a solid 30 minutes.</li>
    <li> Not great--but not bad. But it only fits one of my brushes unless I lean/tilt.  Maybe that the way it was designed to hold them.  Oh well. I didn&#x27;t measure/order carefully.  I still use it by leaning my brush into it (not hanging straight up and down).</li>
    <li> Much smaller than expected and brush doesnt  want to stay on the stand because its too small</li>
    <li> Bought one of these to go with my Body Shop shaving brush.  Very happy I did, it works like a charm keeping the brush dry and increasing the usefulness of the brush.  Was worried about it tipping over but it is manufactured very well.  No worries at all.  highly recommended for the daily Shave Brush user.</li>
    <li> Brush keeps on falling off holder. Maybe its just a defective one, but the top part is not angled properly and the brush keeps sliding off.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my shaving brush from the art of shaving and it fits pretty well.  Very happy with it and it looks pretty cool.</li>
    <li> It sticks well to the mirror, but has a small length.  Doesnt fit most average sized shavign brushes--we flipped it upside down on the mirror and let the brush hang downward instead of how the holder sits in the picture.</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping to use it for the smaller shaving brush that comes as part of a shaving kit, but it won&#x27;t work on that kind. I can use it with the larger ones that usually come with a stand. It is adequate.</li>
