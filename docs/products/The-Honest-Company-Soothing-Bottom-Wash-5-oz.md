<li> and I can only assume it&#x27;s one of the few chemicals use in this spray.</li>
<li> and she finally stopped crying.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve never had this happen with any other product</li>
<li> so they didn&#x27;t leak all over the other products in the box.</li>
<li> only negative thing I&#x27;d say is that both bottles were leaking when they arrived.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a lot of moms said In their review  their children screamed when they sprayed it on them. My son screamed but it it was because it was VERY cold. I also now just spray it on the wipe for an extra cleaning boost. I sprayed it on myself to make sure it didn&#x27;t hurt him and it did not burn me at all; it  was just a shock because it was so cold. It really helped to have this during the first week at home when newborns poop is tar-ish. It also helped to get him extra clean after he was circumcised and helped his healing process to speed up. I did not spray it directly on him at all during the time he was healing but it helped clean up everything around it well by spraying it on the wipes I used. I love this product and use it all over my son because it is a purely natural cleanser not just specifically a  &amp;#34;bottom spray&amp;#34;. Cleans formula/spit up messed well too!</li>
    <li> I like this but I use it for a much older baby. It sounds like it&#x27;s too irritating for a newborn. By the way, this retailer is selling it at double the cost of just buying it from the Honest Company website.</li>
    <li> Made my baby scream too.</li>
    <li> Order this directly from honest co. It&#x27;s cheaper and you know your getting the real product. I&#x27;ve used this for a month on my 4mo old son and its Fabulous! Smells great and makes messy diaper changes a breeze. He smiles and laughs the whole time. (Maybe it only stings little girls? I only spray his cheeks and he&#x27;s fine)</li>
    <li> This caused my 18 month old to scream. She is pretty tough but this had her in tears. Clearly this is a product that has not been well tested as some children are fine with it and some kids are quite hurt.</li>
    <li> I have tried this product on my 3 month old after a diaper change. She looked terrified and could not catch her breath, then screamed as if in horrible pain. I rinsed her off right away and she finally stopped crying. I would not risk this product on any delicate skin, so it isn&#x27;t appropriate for a baby. I love all my other Honest products.</li>
    <li> I bought this from our local pharmacy and tried it on my daughter. She SCREAMED, cried, and lifted and twisted herself off the changing pad - in obvious pain. She had a mild diaper rash so I assumed that was the problem. About a week later after the rash was gone I tried it again and got the same results. I decided to read the reviews on here and saw that many others had the exact experience. I would not recommend this product at all.</li>
    <li> This is a magical product! Like most preemies, my daughter has extremely sensitive skin. The Honest Co has never steered me wrong on a product and this was no exception! This product has helped me clean off my daughter much faster after those big, smelly diaper blow outs!!! Even with her wiggling it gets the job done!!! No diaper rash either!!!</li>
    <li> I felt soothed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better than their sunblock!</li>
    <li> My son had a mild rash (courtesy of antibiotics) and I had emptied most of the bottle and added water to it. Upon spraying my sons bum, he screamed out in pain. I&#x27;ve never had this happen with any other product and I can only assume it&#x27;s one of the few chemicals use in this spray.</li>
    <li> My daughter has very sensitive skin.  I haven&#x27;t had any issues with burning.  It does have an astringent in it which can burn but I like this as it keeps the area clean and has helped clear up a mild diaper rash .</li>
    <li> This caused blisters on my 9 week old&#x27;s private part. He had a major blowout and I thought I had cleaned it all off with wipes. Apparently not. I went to go change his diaper and saw blisters on his shaft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had no issues with it before now. Will not use again on my LO.</li>
    <li> I have no idea how they can &#x27;honestly&#x27; sell this stuff and call it soothing. I used it on my daughter after a diaper change and she literally screamed in agony. Within minutes the entire area had turned bright red and I had to give her a cool bath to calm her down and then cover her in Desitin. Now she won&#x27;t even look at the bottle without crying. I&#x27;m fairly shocked by this product and will avoid like the plague in future.</li>
    <li> Smells great but OUUUUCH!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I mean really? This product is bad, soothing like alcohol on a open blister! Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great when you need a little something extra to wash baby on the changing table, and smells good too!</li>
    <li> This absolutely destroyed my little boys bottom after only one use! He scratched until he bled. I made the mistake of using it one morning before daycare,&lt;br /&gt;Therefor I wasn&#x27;t able to notice anything wrong until the end of the day. I washed him immediately :(. He&#x27;s almost 2!</li>
    <li> Smells really nice and the aloe in here makes it soothing. Cheaper at the actual website. Savings coupon here for $10.00 off your first order: goo.gl/9D04yE The coupon will show once you proceed to the cart… just copy and paste the goo link to get to the website and redeem the coupon (it will automatically happen, no need to do anything else).</li>
    <li> I am shocked that this product is being marketed as a &amp;#34;soothing&amp;#34; bottom wash for babies! My daughter used this on our 22 month old grandson, and he immediately was screaming and literally shaking in pain. He couldn&#x27;t sit down or walk without being in pain afterward. Its inexcusable. The company will definitely be hearing from us, and I hope this review keeps other babies sage from having to experience that. I wouldn&#x27;t even give it one star !</li>
    <li> Sadly, I had the same issue with the last Review.  This product caused my daughter to kick and scream! I felt so bad, I had to rinse her bottom off with cool water.  We will be sticking to Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Cetaphil cleansers.</li>
    <li> I read the 7 reviews for this spray and couldn&#x27;t believe that it actually burned anyone&#x27;s skin.  I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 months on my baby without any problems.  Smells great too!  Don&#x27;t be turned away by the negative reviews.</li>
    <li> This caused my son to scream which lead me to spray my own bottom after a tinkle, and my lady parts were on fire!!! This does not belong on sensitive thin membrane skin or an area with a slight diaper rash. I had to return it... I loved the smell and hope they improve this problem. Love the Diapers, and soooo many other products</li>
    <li> We have used this since our son was one day old. We spray two squirts on his bottom, and use Grovia cloth wipes with warm water for all diaper changes. No chemical saturated wipes for him! He is unaffected by the squirts, the smell is great, and he does not get diaper rash. Great product. I now buy in bulk from the Honest website.</li>
    <li> I do love the honest company. I think that their products are fantastic! This product not so much. There is a product for babies from Mustela which is a liquid and cleans the baby and diaper area well and I used it on my daughter year ago. Flash forward 10 years and now I&#x27;m expecting another child. Bought 3 of these sprays to &amp;#34;squirrel&amp;#34; up prior to his arrival and tested this on my 2 year old niece. My goodness, the way she screamed and said &amp;#34;owie&amp;#34; multiple times while grabbing her tiny lady bits. I had to wash this off on the sink for the burning to go away. I think if they revamped this product so that it wouldn&#x27;t burn it would be better, until then this will be hanging on my shelf. I have it an extra star cause it does smell nice.</li>
    <li> I have used this bottom wash for my infant for several weeks now &amp; ran out when I went to Amazon to purchase more. Rest assured, it is the same quality product that&#x27;s sold by the Honest Co. at Target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter &amp; I both love it. I ordered a bottle for her &amp; a bottle for myself:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have never used it with her during a rash/ so I cannot comment on that- but I can confidently say that this product has kept her rash free since She was 1 month old-  she&#x27;s 3 months now. It is way better than wipes &amp; smells wonderful. For wet diapers: I simply spritz 2-3 times &amp; blot away the wetness, liberally apply A&amp;D ointment (not cream) &amp; put on the disposable diaper. For dirty diapers: I use organic baby wipes to remove the matter from her bum. Then I use a peri-bottle filled with water to rinse the wiped area. (It&#x27;s actually the one they gave me after birth at the hospital). Then, I blot the water off. This removes the chemicals from the wipes. Then I follow the same steps listed above for a wet diaper. This keeps my daughter rash free. I use wipes on the road with A&amp;D ointment- then I just follow the steps listed above for a dirty diaper when I get home (whether she&#x27;s dirty or not- to get the chemicals off her skin.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative thing I&#x27;d say is that both bottles were leaking when they arrived. The caps were loose. Luckily, they were wrapped tightly in plastic- so they didn&#x27;t leak all over the other products in the box. You can see in the photo that some of the product is missing from the 2nd bottle. The 1st bottle was just barely wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m a huge fan &amp; would order this product again from Amazon in the future.</li>
    <li> I use this on my daughter all the time and never have had a problem with it and she has never cried after being sprayed. I only spray her cheeks and it really helps clean her messy diapers, and as an added bonus it makes the smell much better.</li>
    <li> The first time I used it, my daughter didn&#x27;t seem to notice and I was pleasantly pleased with the smell and how easy it made a poppy clean up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, cleaning up the next three poops my daughter screamed.  I wiped and noticed blood on the diaper wipe.  She had never had any little tears on her delicate skin.  So I stopped using the spray.  And after a couple of days, it healed and it didn&#x27;t happen again...until I used the spray...for the second time!  Like the first time, the initial spray use was uneventful, but the following poops, her skin was ripping away where I had sprayed!  I couldn&#x27;t be positive after the first use that there was causation...I thought perhaps coincidence.  But after the second time with the exact same results, I was pretty sure this spray was causing the skin on my daughter&#x27;s bottom to rip and bleed!  And I&#x27;m not willing to try it a third time...this was proof enough for me!  I will be returning!</li>
    <li> My Daughter screamed bloody murder with this product felt terrible!!! Never will use again and will be contacting the company!!!</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product. My 2yr old daughter cries whenever I spray her bottom. After reading the reviews, I will never use this on her again. However it does smell nice but don&#x27;t be fooled. Hopefully they will fix this problem.</li>
    <li> Not sure if ordering from Amazon is the problem but I have used this direct from Honest and love it.  I have used it on my son as early as 1month and we had no problems, no rash, no burning.  For the particularly messy clean up jobs it comes in handy and helps leave him &amp;#34;refreshed&amp;#34; sans bath time.  Again, I would order straight from Honest to make sure it is a &amp;#34;honest&amp;#34; product.</li>
    <li> I was surprised at all of the negative reviews on this product. It smells great and leaves my baby&#x27;s bottm nice and clean. He&#x27;s never reacted negatively when sprayed with this wash.I don&#x27;t saturate his bottom with the spray one or two pumps is enough. I only spray his little bottom and keep away from the urethra.</li>
    <li> Same like the other reviews, my little girl starts screaming when i spray it on her, so i tried it and it burns sooo bad! I cant believe this product is made for babies! Hope i can return it. Love there diapers though</li>
    <li> Works very good on adults too, for overall pericare, frequent incontinence, overall  hygiene in general.  Light scent and no residue left behind. Awesome product for the whole family.</li>
