### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Best of all, it&#x27;s cruelty-free.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Received on time,&amp; it lengthens my lashes wonderfully .</li>
      <li>This is the best &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; mascara I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>For the price I am beyond impressed!!!</li>
      <li>This is a good product!</li>
      <li>So I was happy to hear about E.L.F.&#x27;s commitment to cruelty-free practices, though because of how inexpensive their products are, I wasn&#x27;t holding my breath that the mascara I ordered from them would be very good.</li>
      <li>waterproof, doesn&#x27;t run, which is great.</li>
      <li>I was most impressed with the brush, which didn&#x27;t clump.  </li>
      <li>Gotta love the price point for excellent mascara as well.</li>
      <li>But for the money, it is good.</li>
      <li>love this mascara!</li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>my favorite feature!</li>
      <li>A great mascara if you&#x27;re looking for affordable and cruelty free.</li>
      <li>Okay let&#x27;s be honest, with ELF cosmetic line you pay a fraction of the \\&quot;usual\\&quot; price of make up....</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s cheap!</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t wait to buy more</li>
      <li>Although it does take two coats to get the best coverage, I haven&#x27;t found any brand that only takes one coat.</li>
      <li>Love this mascara.</li>
      <li>I bought a Max Studio at TJMaxx and fell in love with how it separates the lashes and doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
      <li>It would probably be a better bet for someone who does not have oily skin.</li>
      <li>Still love it and will continue to purchase it.</li>
      <li>The only thing this mascara lacks is the lengthening isn&#x27;t as great as it claims.</li>
      <li>The pigment is good and I like the skinny brush for application, but it smudged almost instantly, even if you blot off excess.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used many different brands of mascara and this mascara is one of my top 5 choices.</li>
      <li>It is not waterproof and comes right off when I go in our pool.</li>
      <li>Other than that, the actual product is great.</li>
      <li>I do find if you want a more dramatic look, 2 or more coats before mascara has set may be needed.</li>
      <li>The brush is amazing as well it pushes my lashes out further then any other brush does.</li>
      <li>I was happy to be wrong: this volumizing mascara makes my eyelashes look like I&#x27;m wearing false ones (in a good way), and it&#x27;s waterproof like whoa, which I also need.</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>It seemed as though it was old.  </li>
      <li>And generally, when you do, the items are way overpriced.</li>
      <li>Glides on smoothly, very intense black color!</li>

<li> It seemed as though it was old.  </li>
<li> And generally, when you do, the items are way overpriced.</li>
<li> Glides on smoothly, very intense black color!</li>
<li> It is half the size of a normal mascara.</li>
<li> The clumping has been a real issue with me in the past, despite the products&#x27; claims otherwise.  </li>
<li> Highly recommend, don&#x27;t waste your money on more expensive brands!</li>
<li> The long side the brush!</li>
<li> There&#x27;s not very much mascara in this at all.</li>
<li> it is not thick whatsoever, I just personally prefer an extremely thin line.</li>
<li> I tried to put a drop of water in and wet it inside, but then it was goopy.  </li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t sting, as other mascaras have, when I get an eyelash in my eye.</li>
<li> Not much lengthening or volume that I can see, and the container actually holding the product is VERY SMALL.</li>
<li> This mascara was dried out.  </li>
<li> And honestly don&#x27;t waste your money, I&#x27;ll be looking elsewhere.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s almost like its dried out.</li>
<li> No strong odor, no eye sensitivity.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s no easy task trying to find cosmetics (or anything for that matter) made by companies that don&#x27;t test on animals or use animal products.</li>
<li> Very little clumping</li>
<li> It is hard to get used to.</li>
<li> But it is very small.</li>
<li> It has serious hold-power.  </li>
<li> I wish the applicator was a little thinner, but don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
<li> It is really not a good mascara.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> works well! waterproof, doesn&#x27;t run, which is great. Not tested on animals, my favorite feature!</li>
    <li> Received on time,&amp; it lengthens my lashes wonderfully . I will be repurchasing this when I run out. The brush is amazing as well it pushes my lashes out further then any other brush does.</li>
    <li> Wow! For the price I am beyond impressed!!! Glides on smoothly, very intense black color! Lasts for hours and no smudges!  I wish the applicator was a little thinner, but don&#x27;t get me wrong it is not thick whatsoever, I just personally prefer an extremely thin line. Highly recommend, don&#x27;t waste your money on more expensive brands!</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s not very much mascara in this at all. It&#x27;s almost like its dried out.</li>
    <li> A great mascara if you&#x27;re looking for affordable and cruelty free.</li>
    <li> I bought this at Drug Emporium.  I didn&#x27;t like the way the handle was made, the brush rod is short. (The space between the brush and handle.) Other than that, the actual product is great.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It has helped with my eye lashes growing I can&#x27;t wait to buy more and it&#x27;s cheap!</li>
    <li> It is not waterproof and comes right off when I go in our pool. It is really not a good mascara. I would not recommend it at all</li>
    <li> Not much lengthening or volume that I can see, and the container actually holding the product is VERY SMALL.</li>
    <li> This is a good product! But it is very small. It is half the size of a normal mascara. The short side is the product. The long side the brush! It is hard to get used to. But for the money, it is good.</li>
    <li> This mascara was dried out.  I tried to put a drop of water in and wet it inside, but then it was goopy.  It seemed as though it was old.  I found some at a store and threw out the two I&#x27;d bought.</li>
    <li> Vegan, inexpensive and waterproof.  Just what I was looking for.  One coat does it.  Anymore than that and it will clump.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s no easy task trying to find cosmetics (or anything for that matter) made by companies that don&#x27;t test on animals or use animal products. And generally, when you do, the items are way overpriced. So I was happy to hear about E.L.F.&#x27;s commitment to cruelty-free practices, though because of how inexpensive their products are, I wasn&#x27;t holding my breath that the mascara I ordered from them would be very good. I was happy to be wrong: this volumizing mascara makes my eyelashes look like I&#x27;m wearing false ones (in a good way), and it&#x27;s waterproof like whoa, which I also need. It totally rocks. Thank you thank you E.L.F. for making a quality product that&#x27;s cruelty-free and affordable.</li>
    <li> The pigment is good and I like the skinny brush for application, but it smudged almost instantly, even if you blot off excess. It would probably be a better bet for someone who does not have oily skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many different brands of mascara and this mascara is one of my top 5 choices. Very little clumping and it stays put for hours. The only thing this mascara lacks is the lengthening isn&#x27;t as great as it claims. It does work to some degree but after 4 or 5 coats.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara. I bought a Max Studio at TJMaxx and fell in love with how it separates the lashes and doesn&#x27;t clump. When I went to search for a replacement (you know that never happens at TJMaxx!) I found the same packaging of e.l.f. - it is the same. Still love it and will continue to purchase it. Gotta love the price point for excellent mascara as well.</li>
    <li> This is the best &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; mascara I&#x27;ve used.  No strong odor, no eye sensitivity.  It has serious hold-power.  I was most impressed with the brush, which didn&#x27;t clump.  The clumping has been a real issue with me in the past, despite the products&#x27; claims otherwise.  I do find if you want a more dramatic look, 2 or more coats before mascara has set may be needed.</li>
    <li> Okay let&#x27;s be honest, with ELF cosmetic line you pay a fraction of the \\&quot;usual\\&quot; price of make up.... And it shows... Tiny bottle that was Gina in two weeks, and every time I wore it I had to put on 3 coats just to match 1 coat of my pricier mascara. Also, this claims to be waterproof but it is NOT. Don&#x27;t be fooled. And honestly don&#x27;t waste your money, I&#x27;ll be looking elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using e.l.f. Waterproof Lengthening and Volumizing Mascara for a couple years. It&#x27;s cheaper to get it on Amazon with Prime shipping or through the free-shipping Add-On program, than to get on http://eyeslipsface.com/ and pay their shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this mascara! Although it does take two coats to get the best coverage, I haven&#x27;t found any brand that only takes one coat. It is waterproof, it is tear-proof, it is sweat-proof and sometimes it even lasts over night. It doesn&#x27;t sting, as other mascaras have, when I get an eyelash in my eye. Best of all, it&#x27;s cruelty-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, E.L.F.!</li>
