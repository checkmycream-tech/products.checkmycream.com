### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The replacement head fits perfectly, now.</li>
      <li>They are a great deal for the money though.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;These would be a great value if it weren&#x27;t for these two problems.</li>
      <li>Work just as great as the name brand ones.</li>
      <li>We went to sams club and  bought name brands that work great</li>
      <li>I coated the metal stem of the handle where the brush attaches with a couple coats of nail polish, and it worked great.</li>
      <li>The replacement head is a great option for those of us who cannot afford $25 for three replacement heads.  </li>
      <li>Im sure it would be a perfect fit with the right mate :)</li>
      <li>head more</li>
      <li>The quality is not there, but the price is pretty good, I can&#x27;t find the better price than that, you pay what you get</li>
      <li>After about 10-20 uses, the brush head will easily slide/fall off the handle while brushing.</li>
      <li>These heads work fine</li>
      <li>The tips work fine, except when the barrel is installed backward and there was no way to reverse the tip on one of the brushes.</li>
      <li>On the ones that stay on the toothbrush it work just fine.</li>
      <li>They brush just fine.</li>
      <li>It functions with my Sonicare, does not fit perfectly, and does not come with the cover.</li>
      <li>Just remember that if you have a UV cleaner, they won&#x27;t fit inside as the hole in the bottom won&#x27;t fit on the pegs that they provide.  </li>
      <li>I strongly suggest that you pay the extra money for good ones ..</li>
      <li>Stick to the original product.</li>
      <li>In 3 years I&#x27;ve never had a problem with original Phillips Sonicare brush heads.</li>
      <li>, it might worth your money to buy the cheap ones if you want to change your brush</li>
      <li>Vibrates right off and falls Into the sink or your mouth - and you can only get a refund if they are unused and still in he package - good luck to find out if they work for you.  </li>
      <li>Pay a little more for the authentic ones!</li>
      <li>These units are decent enough, maybe not quite as good as the original items from philips, but at about 25% of the price i am not complaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>, the first shipment went missing, not arriving after over 18 days, but the vendor sent another set which arrived within 4 days, so it was all good!</li>
      <li>I thought it was funny when it happened to my wife, until I started using one of these brush heads.  </li>
      <li>As others have said, these brushes don&#x27;t stay on the handle after the first couple uses.</li>
      <li>wife and I are happy especially considering the ridiculous price of the original.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s difficult to even get a good brushing in with these cheap knockoffs.</li>
      <li>The nail polish could then be reapplied if needed before attaching the new brush.</li>
      <li>The best way to use them once that happens is to turn them around on the shaft and jam them on backwards, but I&#x27;m wary of doing it too much because the tight fit starts taking the small pieces off the shaft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have been using the brush like this for a week and have had no problems with it coming off so far.</li>
      <li>I had to throw them all away, just pay the extra for the real deal</li>
      <li>Please do not waste your hard-earned money on this.</li>
      <li>I am not sure why, but as we don&#x27;t use the UV sanitizer much, it was worth it to save the money.</li>
      <li>It really shouldn&#x27;t be that hard to do right, but these generic brushes are a very loose fit compared to the Phillips brand ones.  </li>
      <li>Seriously don&#x27;t be cheap fork out the extra few bucks and get something that will work.</li>
      <li>Initially they are much noiser because they fit loosely and after brushing my teeth for less then ten seconds the brushes fall off the handle.</li>
      <li>Loose fit means much of the energy is lost rattling the brush on it&#x27;s mount, brushes come off when you least expect it.</li>
      <li>soft and not a good fit.</li>
      <li>After a few brushings they come right off and won&#x27;t stay on.</li>
      <li>loosened up and fell off within the first few weeks of use.</li>
      <li>At first when i put it on it worked well then after a few times brushing the brush head would pop out.</li>
      <li>Makes it totally useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the varying bristle lengths aren&#x27;t as contoured as the real ProResults bristles are, and the results is harsher feeling brushing experience, and less coverage and penetration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The brushes do seem to be softer than non-generic so judge for yourself if that is good or bad.</li>

<li> The brushes do seem to be softer than non-generic so judge for yourself if that is good or bad.</li>
<li> Time will tell whether it will last the whole three months, but at least it allows me to use the brushes I bought.</li>
<li> 8 months/pkg-maybe) and buying 3 of the name brand ones works out to $9 a brush (each one lasts as long as you want it to)</li>
<li> Complete waste of money.</li>
<li> The other generic brand did work well.</li>
<li> These are definitely generic, not worth the money.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know how well this would work for multiple users, with the repeated switching out of brushes, but at least for singles who only need to remove the brush every three months, it is a possible fix.</li>
<li> The brushes do not fit properly.</li>
<li> Concerns about not fitting weren&#x27;t founded in my purchase; it doesn&#x27;t slip off when using after several weeks.</li>
<li> Not worth saving money over the legitimate Philips replacement heads.</li>
<li> I have found a solution to this problem, at least for single users.</li>
<li> I am offering a 3 star rating because the toothbrush heads did not fit my toothbrush.</li>
<li> I got this toothbrush head thinking it would save me a few bucks.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> To fit my CVS-brand knock-off of the Sonicare toothbrush, I needed to take the adapter out of the base of the toothbrush head.</li>
<li> As all of the previous negative reviews have stated (and yes I did read them before I bought, but wanted to save money)</li>
<li> Unfortunately after one session of use, the latching component inside the head gets bent and makes it so the head constantly falls of the tooth brush during brushing.</li>
<li> They are missing an internal metal clip that mates to the base unit (no loss of functionality).</li>
<li> Worst complaint: the base portion that attaches to the toothbrush handle does not attach very tightly and wears quickly.</li>
<li> These brushes are poorly made and unusable..complete junk.</li>
<li> Simply stick a screwdriver or scissor blade into the base, turn, and pull.</li>
<li> They do not accept the colored rings at the base that help family members tell multiple heads apart.</li>
<li> Well i thought wrong.</li>
<li> These generic brush heads are TERRIBLE!!!</li>
<li> I guess :(</li>
<li> Terrible for cleaning your teeth.</li>
<li> Terrible, the bristles just fell out in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Horrible product.  </li>
<li> Extremely annoying!!!  </li>

Simply stick a screwdriver or scissor blade into the base, turn, and pull. The replacement head fits perfectly, now.</li>
    <li> These units are decent enough, maybe not quite as good as the original items from philips, but at about 25% of the price i am not complaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With respect to the transaction, the first shipment went missing, not arriving after over 18 days, but the vendor sent another set which arrived within 4 days, so it was all good!</li>
    <li> Each brush head lasted no longer than 2 weeks before it would &amp;#34;wiggle&amp;#34; off the unit while in use.  Horrible product.  Please do not waste your hard-earned money on this.</li>
    <li> Vibrates right off and falls Into the sink or your mouth - and you can only get a refund if they are unused and still in he package - good luck to find out if they work for you.  We went to sams club and  bought name brands that work great</li>
    <li> Fits the toothbrush, but not the sanitizer.  They are a great deal for the money though.  I would recommend them.  Just remember that if you have a UV cleaner, they won&#x27;t fit inside as the hole in the bottom won&#x27;t fit on the pegs that they provide.  I am not sure why, but as we don&#x27;t use the UV sanitizer much, it was worth it to save the money.</li>
    <li> These are definitely generic, not worth the money.  They come off the handle while you&#x27;re trying to brush your teeth.  I thought it was funny when it happened to my wife, until I started using one of these brush heads.  It&#x27;s difficult to even get a good brushing in with these cheap knockoffs.</li>
    <li> Terrible, the bristles just fell out in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too soft and not a good fit.</li>
    <li> These units are generic (not Phillips) replacement heads. They brush just fine. They do not accept the colored rings at the base that help family members tell multiple heads apart. They are missing an internal metal clip that mates to the base unit (no loss of functionality). The bristles are slightly different.</li>
    <li> After a few brushings they come right off and won&#x27;t stay on. Terrible for cleaning your teeth. Complete waste of money. I bought another generic brand and thought this was it but I should have doubled check. The other generic brand did work well.</li>
    <li> These heads won&#x27;t stay on the handle as you brush your teeth. Pay a little more for the authentic ones!</li>
    <li> These heads work fine, they fall off a bit (never had that happen with the non-generic head) but it helps if you take the ring underneath off.</li>
    <li> It really shouldn&#x27;t be that hard to do right, but these generic brushes are a very loose fit compared to the Phillips brand ones.  Loose fit means much of the energy is lost rattling the brush on it&#x27;s mount, brushes come off when you least expect it.</li>
    <li> These generic brush heads are TERRIBLE!!! They vibrate off the handle and I constantly have to stop my sonic every 20 seconds or so to push the brush head back onto the handle. Never again! Stick to the original product. In 3 years I&#x27;ve never had a problem with original Phillips Sonicare brush heads. Extremely annoying!!!  If I could give this product ZERO stars I would.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Vibrates off the handle after about 15 seconds... I strongly suggest that you pay the extra money for good ones .. these are junk!!</li>
    <li> I am offering a 3 star rating because the toothbrush heads did not fit my toothbrush. Im sure it would be a perfect fit with the right mate :)</li>
    <li> I ordered these heads for my sonicare tooth brush because they were cheaper. Unfortunately after one session of use, the latching component inside the head gets bent and makes it so the head constantly falls of the tooth brush during brushing. I had to throw them all away, just pay the extra for the real deal I guess :(</li>
    <li> As all of the previous negative reviews have stated (and yes I did read them before I bought, but wanted to save money) these brush heads  loosened up and fell off within the first few weeks of use. The best way to use them once that happens is to turn them around on the shaft and jam them on backwards, but I&#x27;m wary of doing it too much because the tight fit starts taking the small pieces off the shaft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you consider that a 4-pack is $8.99 (use each for 2 months &#x3D; 8 months/pkg-maybe) and buying 3 of the name brand ones works out to $9 a brush (each one lasts as long as you want it to), it might worth your money to buy the cheap ones if you want to change your brush head more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caveat emptor!</li>
    <li> It functions with my Sonicare, does not fit perfectly, and does not come with the cover.</li>
    <li> Not worth saving money over the legitimate Philips replacement heads. These are junk and the bristles do not have the strength to withstand the vibrations from the toothbrush handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would rate zero stars if it were applicable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY</li>
    <li> Concerns about not fitting weren&#x27;t founded in my purchase; it doesn&#x27;t slip off when using after several weeks. The brushes do seem to be softer than non-generic so judge for yourself if that is good or bad. wife and I are happy especially considering the ridiculous price of the original.</li>
    <li> I got this toothbrush head thinking it would save me a few bucks. Well i thought wrong. At first when i put it on it worked well then after a few times brushing the brush head would pop out. No matter what i did it still would not stay in place, even if i do not turn my toothbrush and manually brush it still would pop out. Seriously don&#x27;t be cheap fork out the extra few bucks and get something that will work.</li>
    <li> The quality is not there, but the price is pretty good, I can&#x27;t find the better price than that, you pay what you get</li>
    <li> The tips work fine, except when the barrel is installed backward and there was no way to reverse the tip on one of the brushes.</li>
    <li> Work just as great as the name brand ones. I will be buying these again next year. I bought enough this time for a year because if the price. Next year it&#x27;s because of the quality</li>
    <li> As others have said, these brushes don&#x27;t stay on the handle after the first couple uses. I have found a solution to this problem, at least for single users. I coated the metal stem of the handle where the brush attaches with a couple coats of nail polish, and it worked great. I have been using the brush like this for a week and have had no problems with it coming off so far. I don&#x27;t know how well this would work for multiple users, with the repeated switching out of brushes, but at least for singles who only need to remove the brush every three months, it is a possible fix. The nail polish could then be reapplied if needed before attaching the new brush. Time will tell whether it will last the whole three months, but at least it allows me to use the brushes I bought. Hope this helps some others who purchased these brushes.</li>
    <li> On the ones that stay on the toothbrush it work just fine. Have one that didn&#x27;t want to stay in the brush. For the price of this I would not want to send back for a replacement.</li>
    <li> The brushes do not fit properly. Initially they are much noiser because they fit loosely and after brushing my teeth for less then ten seconds the brushes fall off the handle. These brushes are poorly made and unusable..complete junk.</li>
