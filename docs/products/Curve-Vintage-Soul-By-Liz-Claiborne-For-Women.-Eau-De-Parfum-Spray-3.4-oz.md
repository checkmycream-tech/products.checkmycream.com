<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Yes it did. It is so hard to find.</li>
    <li> I bought a small bottle of this on a whim since it was mad cheap at a discount store. It was absolutely horrible, reminds me of mothballs. I scrubbed it off as soon as I could and got rid of the bottle. I guess it smells better on other people since it&#x27;s received high ratings on here... O.o</li>
    <li> Product came as described, in a timely manner. My wife has been looking for this perfume for a while, when I saw it, I knew I had to get it for her.</li>
    <li> VERY DISAPPOINTED, LOVE THE CURVE SOUL FOR MEN..... THOUGHT I WOULD TRY THIS FOR MYSELF, BOY WAS I WRONG! VERY STRONG &amp; SMELLS LIKE BUG SPRAY! YUCK</li>
    <li> I was surprised, both because I bought this without smelling it first, and also because this scent received rave reviews. Let me tell you...this perfume smells odd, is way too strong, and doesn&#x27;t fit with the other Curve products I know and love. The description says floral, citrus, and vanilla musk and I smelled 85% floral, 10% citrus, and 5% vanilla musk. This is nice for people who like feminine floral, but not nice for people like me who appreciate oriental, musky, heavier, womanly scents. Lesson learned: I will never buy a scent without having smelled/tested it first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I would order from Fragrance Net again --- I LOVE the sample scents and also appreciated the coupons.</li>
    <li> I just love this product, I get so many compliments.  I&#x27;m told it smells very sensous and seductive.  Thanks AMAZON for the great prices!</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t smelled this before I bought it and was a bit skeptical.  It arrived much faster than I expected and I was pleasantly surprised...it goes on a bit too strong for my liking but the scent calms to leave a wonderful, lingering scent that lasts all day.  This is definitely going to become one of my new favorites.  And the price is just right through amazon.</li>
    <li> I got the Mens Soul for myself and this for my cousin.  She said she loves it.  Maybe she was just being nice but I think it smells pretty darn good too.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful and it smells great and I am enjoying this product very much I am glad I order two of them. Thanks Amazon for your excellent assistance with this order. this order had arrived right on time and in excellent condition. Thanks again!</li>
    <li> I have loved this fragrance ever since I tried a mini sample. I get many comments and compliments on how unusual it is. If you love spicy complex fragrances you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume because it was on sale for $6.50 at Marshalls. Many of my friends love the Curve label, so I figured that it would be a safe impulse buy. I LOVE it. But I am saying that stores like Rosses and Marshalls probably have a better deal.  -H.</li>
    <li> THIS IS SUCH A PLEASANT SCENT. I ALWAYS GET COMPLIMENTS ON THIS PERFUME.    HAVENT FOUND A PERFUME THAT I LIKED IN YEARS.    TRY IT YOU WILL LOVE IT.....</li>
    <li> NOT OPEN TILL MOTHERS DAY</li>
    <li> i&#x27;d give it five stars, but the spray button will pop off if you&#x27;re not very careful.  This is with all Curve Vintage Soul items i&#x27;ve received including the body spray.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance, however is just as it has ever been, beautiful.  I&#x27;m so glad it is still available.</li>
    <li> Love it and it came quick</li>
    <li> This is my favorite cologne.  I had been looking for it in stores for years and was delighted to find it on Amazon  for such a great price!  Well worth the investment!</li>
    <li> OK, what could I expect for $12.00, after all? But with the *Liz* name on it, I figured I&#x27;d try it. It was a beautiful box and a pretty bottle,but I could already smell it before I opened it up, and It Did Not Smell Good. It smelled like the cheap, over-alcoholed floral spray worn by Aunt Mathilda.    I opened it up, cautiously sniffed the sprayer, and remembered that a reviewer here had said it smelled flowery, but that it developed into a richer scent in a few minutes. So, I sprayed a shot onto the inside of my forearm.  Oh, GAG!!!!!!!!!!! It was just as bad, only more of it. I went outside and waved my arm around, trying to evaporate the alcohol.     After  about 5 minutes, I couldn&#x27;t take it any more, so I went to the kitchen sink to wash it off. It Would Not Wash Off. I used dish soap, which did nothing at all. The oils in this cologne were impervious to soap and water. So,I tried rubbing vegetable oil on the spot, and then rewashing it. That got rid of most of the smell, but all day long I kept getting a whiff of this stuff. It smelled a lot like \\&quot;Cachet\\&quot;, which was popular with high-school girls in the 70s. But Cachet at least wore off after a while.     I took it to work and left in in the ladies&#x27;room 3 weeks ago, where we all leave samples of lotion, perfume and other toiletry items in a basket for everyone to use. It&#x27;s still there, unused.     Archaeologists will find this bottle in 1000 years, note its lovely design, and when they open it up they will announce this was a container for a deadly poison gas, known at the time as a \\&quot;WMD.\\&quot;    Do not buy this perfume.</li>
    <li> I took a chance on this cologne, and oh My God! It is awesome. Smells wonderful! I will buy more when I get low. didn&#x27;t cost much either!</li>
    <li> I love this item!  It is one of the best smelling perfumes around.  I highly recommend this product for purchase.</li>
    <li> When my wife wears this...well, we are now expecting our third child!    Things that make me go...hmmmmmmmm.</li>
    <li> not a whole lot to say except that my gf loves this scent, so i got it for her and she loved it.  would recomend this friends and family.</li>
    <li> I ordered this parfum for my Mom and she loves it! After smelling it for myself, I see why she likes it. The smell is a very \\&quot;lite\\&quot; and \\&quot;clean\\&quot; scent. Not bombarded nor overly \\&quot;perfumey\\&quot; like a lot of others can be. It stays the same throughout the day and seems to last a while Overall, she was pleased as was I.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d bought a bottle of this because I love the regular [[ASIN:B000P20QKW Curve Soul]] &amp; I&#x27;d read that this was supposed to be just as good. It is, but I&#x27;m slightly disappointed by my body&#x27;s reaction to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is a wonderfully musky scent that is more mature version of the original &amp; when I first put it on I was pleased with how I smelled. Unfortunately there&#x27;s two things about it that I do have to warn people about. First is that a little of this goes a long way, which I quickly discovered. (People assured me that it was fine, but I&#x27;m a little sensitive to perfume scents which is why I liked the original one so much.) The second was that after about an hour on my skin the perfume scent changed, which is not a fault of the perfume itself but rather my personal chemistry interacting with the perfume. A friend of mine has used this &amp; absolutely loves it, so I&#x27;ll probably give my bottle to her to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent itself is wonderful &amp; would make for a great \\&quot;night\\&quot; scent to wear on a sexy date or a night on the town. I just wish that I was able to wear it.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume.  A fresh clean aroma, not over powering.  Everyone comments.  Arrived quickly and in perfect shape.</li>
    <li> Curve Vintage Soul.... even the name is appealing. I bought this fragrance without smelling it first, based on the product reviews of others. It had gotten such high ratings. When I got my cologne, I was surprised at how large the bottle was! That&#x27;s a lot of scent for the money! And what can I say about the scent? Its fabulous and I get a lot of compliments. You don&#x27;t need to apply much as it is strong and has staying power. A wonderful scent. I highly recommend this for daytime wear. Just remember to apply with a light hand-- a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> My wife discovered this when a friend gave her one of those little samples(in a small cylindrical bottle). It has been her favorite perfume for years and she more than gets my attention when she wears it. :-) It is soft/flowery/warm and gently. Its not a really big brand name as far as women&#x27;s perfumes go but buy it and you will wonder how did you do without it.   She gets a lot of compliments from friends and family and this is now her primary fragrance.    It&#x27;s priced quite well and easily outdoes bigger brand names and other over priced perfumes.</li>
    <li> I bought this because the price was right and the bottle was gorgeous. The bottle is the only reason why I gave it 2 stars because the bottle is seriously awesome. The scent itself was overbearing and overwhelming. I am not kidding, I sprayed one spray on my arm and even after 10 hours, I can still smell it and it is still nauseating. It smells like incense, if you like smelling like an old hippie or like a Catholic church during a funeral (I am Catholic so not being ignorant), then this is all you! It has high patchouli and musk notes, it smells manly and the smell lingers (10+ hours and unfortunately still going strong!). I will mention my favorite normal scents are like the regular Curve and Dolce &amp; Gabbanna Light Blue so you know my taste in scent and I am 31 so you can see where I am coming from and you can do with this review as you wish. I just felt the need to reaffirm that this smells nothing like any of the other Curve&#x27;s because it got such rave reviews I thought it would be awesome and um, yeah...no.</li>
    <li> Great perfume that is musky but slightly sweet at the same time. Lots of compliments when I where this perfume.</li>
    <li> Although, I bought this product as a gift, I received it in perfect condition and delivery was very fast!  I was very pleased with my online purchase.</li>
    <li> didnt like it very much / it smells like it is for men   but it came before time</li>
    <li> I purchased this product not exactly sure what it smells like!  However, I am so impressed and I have found my new scent/retailer!  The packaging was safe for shipment and everything was completely sealed.  The smell is soft enough to wear during the day but dramatic enough to wear out at night.    I HIGHLY recommend!</li>
    <li> The eau de parfum spray is loud, long-lasting, and the scent is manly. I would not recommend this product to any woman who wants a soft, feminine scent. Think twice before ordering because you will not be able to return it to Amazon. The service I received from the seller is excellent and the product arrived wrapped and exactly as described.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Curve Vintage and I received this item very quickly. Not only was I pleased with the size of the bottle for the price but I was pleased how it came packaged.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume... I often get compliments about it.  I rarely see it in any store, so have to hunt for it on line, but I&#x27;m glad I can still find it.</li>
    <li> Perfumes smell differently on everyone, but this is the best I have ever had. I have been using it for YEARS and can now only find it online. I get a ton of compliments, people asking what I wear and I enjoy the name of the perfume even. &amp;#34;Vintage Soul,&amp;#34; is a good description of me! I don&#x27;t know the accurate way to describe perfumes, but I would consider this kind of a musk, a little spicy patchouli, a little floral and even a little citrus. It&#x27;s sexy. It&#x27;s not too strong - never a complaint that it&#x27;s offensive. Beautiful bottle too!</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself when I bought Curve Soul for my husband.  He liked his, but I am not as crazy about Vintage Soul for me.  It&#x27;s not too bad, and I keep trying it to see if maybe I just don&#x27;t like it when I first put it on, but I don&#x27;t think it lasts very long on me at all, I can&#x27;t smell it after 30 minutes or so.  I should have bought a sample first.</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance.  Of all the perfumes I have this is my favorite!  This is a really large bottle, great value.  Buying from Amazon saved me about $23. from the outlet store prices!!</li>
    <li> I have received many compliments (especially frm guys) while wearing this fragrance.  I have paid much more 4 other products that people don&#x27;t even notice much less compliment.  4 D price, I had to stock up!</li>
    <li> I simply love this perfume! The price was unbeatable! The perfume is wonderful! I am very pleased! The scent lasts all day!  When you layer with the bodywash, lotion &amp; perfume, it&#x27;s not overkill! I could literally take a second shower in this perfume its so wonderful!</li>
    <li> A cousin introduced me to this perfume.  I love it because the fragrance is simply nice and especially lasting.  I have gotten several compliments for it. I would recommend it to anyone. I find the scent somewhat strong but mild and it does not upset my allergies. Great product!!</li>
    <li> love this !!!everyone always says /&amp;quot;You smell GOOD!&amp;quot; i say i know :D TY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;love this !!!everyone always says /&amp;quot;You smell GOOD!&amp;quot; i say i know :D TY</li>
    <li> Scent is dated. Not for me</li>
    <li> Use it every day.  It has a mature smell, not a citrus smelling perfume....I have used it for 5 years</li>
    <li> No complaint and it is according to expectation.  Perfume is alright.  Size and price are good.  Bought it because of very good reviews but personally I feel it is not as special as the other perfumes purchased by me.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. It comes on a little strong at first so you don&#x27;t want to drown yourself in it. At first your not sure what it&#x27;s going to smell like but give it about 5 minutes and it calms down to a nice exotic peppery floral. It smells really clean, a little powdery, imagine coming out of the shower after using all of your most fantastic smelling shampoos, shower gels, lotions and powders and this is what you get, and it it last a long time. It is good for everyday, work and play but also sensual, sexy and exotic, I guess you could say a little sex during the day in a perfume bottle! lol....You&#x27;ll have fun sniffing your wrist trying to figure it out.</li>
    <li> This perfume is great!!! It is strong and a little goes a long way. It can be used for casual or evening wear. I love it!!!</li>
    <li> This has been my perfume for years.  I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on it.  The smell is one of a kind and I love it.  It really is for the vintage soul with an earthy note to it.</li>
    <li> I just adore this parfum, in fact it has been my signature scent.  I was very satisfied with the product, however I an amazed at the price increase. I started using this a couple years back and could purchase it for around $18.00.</li>
    <li> This was to be a Christmas gift, and to my suprise when my friend opened the package it mwas one third filled and smelled slightly like Cruve.  My friend and I were both disappointed.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife and she loves it.  A sweet smelling perfume that women love and at a great price</li>
    <li> I love this.  It is so hard to find.  I get so many compliments when I wear it.  I understand why it has mixed reviews.  Others in my family have tried it and it doesn&#x27;t smell the same on everyone.  In my experience you either love this or hate it.  It always reminds me of Vivid when I wear it for those of you that remember Vivid by Liz Claiborne.</li>
    <li> Prompt service. Great price.</li>
    <li> worth every but of penny</li>
    <li> love this perfume sad i can only order it online</li>
    <li> I really like curves this is some what hard to find Vintage Soul......It smell so good&lt;br /&gt;I love it when people ask me what are you wearing ....I say I forgot  can&#x27;t remember!!!  :-)&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> Wonderful scent  that I&#x27;ve been using for over 8 years. it is hard to find and I was very concerned about getting a knock off but this is the real deal! Beautiful scent ...warm Amber undertones,feminine, exotic. There is no other sent out there like it. I&#x27;m am sooo happy!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be buying another bottle soon because I&#x27;m scared this Seller will run out and I can&#x27;t live without my vintage soul!!</li>
    <li> This perfume surprised me cuz I thought it would smell like floral and soft , it&#x27;&#x27;s a little strong and musky but overall it still smells good, I love it. :)</li>
    <li> Curve Vintage Soul is a delightful fragrance with staying power and it was offered at a good price.  I would definitely recommend this fragrance to friends and family.</li>
    <li> I buy this every year, and the 3.4 oz bottle lasts the entire 12 months. Stumbled on this by accident and will always buy it. It&#x27;s clean and fresh, but still musky and sexy. Flowers, vanilla, musk and spices- this scent has it all. Perfect for any occasion- drives people crazy and they have to know what I&#x27;m wearing. Lots of compliments from that little bottle :) try it, you&#x27;ll be hooked too!</li>
    <li> If I could I would give no stars at all for this item. Don&#x27;t buy it unless you wanna smell like a dog</li>
    <li> Smells great, similar to Angel, my favorite, deliscious flowers and spice...for about 14 seconds. Then it&#x27;s gone.I can&#x27;t recommend, not cheap at any price.</li>
    <li> i love it&lt;br /&gt;My friend liked it very, very, very&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much&lt;br /&gt;Me credibility in dealing&lt;br /&gt;My friend liked it very, very, very&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much&lt;br /&gt;Me credibility in dealing</li>
    <li> Love this perfume. It was boxed well, very secure shipment. I hope to buy more at some point as it is my favorite.</li>
    <li> This scent still smells great on those who wear it. It is not overbearing and lightly scented. Its somewhat fruity too.</li>
    <li> Love it.............will never wear anything else.  Took me awhile to find something I really love and now that I have, that&#x27;s it!</li>
    <li> nice item. price is good. couldnt have asked for anything more. i was pleased with the overall purchase and everything.</li>
    <li> love using this product.  It smells very good.  I use it all the time.  I am very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite fragrances and it is very hard to find - I got this very quickly - thank you!</li>
    <li> This perfume is my favorite and has been for a long time.  I often get comments about the scent, men and women a like love it!  I just hope they never stop making it, because its part of who I am :)</li>
    <li> I purchase this for my daughter. It is her favorite cologne. What more can I say!!!!!</li>
    <li> Ever since I bought this perfume years ago I love it get a lot of compliments on it will continue to buy this perfume</li>
    <li> Never mind that the only way to purchase this parfum is through an online store, this is still my most favorite parfum from Liz Claiborne.  I guess it didn&#x27;t sell that well in the stores, nevertheless, I absolutely love it!  Including the shower gel and the body lotion.</li>
    <li> Bought for wife...she loves this scent!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite perfumes smells amazing! will be buying another bottle soon almost out it has a very romantic smell to it.</li>
    <li> Everytime I put this on I get compliments!  Hope they never quit making it.  Smells so awesome, thank you!! K</li>
    <li> I&#x27;VE BEEN LOOKING FOR THIS PARFUM SPRAY FOR MONTHS. IT SMELLS GREAT AND THE SCENT LAST ALL DAY. LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> This stinks really good. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s my favorite that my wife wears and was a very good price.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also difficult to find in stores where we are.</li>
    <li> it smells really good, have had many compliments on it. I would recomend this sent for an evening out. I think i&#x27;ll order another before you can&#x27;t get it anymore.</li>
    <li> I was surprised to receive my perfume within 4 days of placing my order. That&#x27;s fast! Accurate description &amp; good pricing. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I placed my order on 11/26/2012 and was sent the wrong perfume.  I spoke to them today 12/18/12 and I will still have to wait on a corrected order to be shipped because they are now out of the prodeuct and never corrected it when I called and reported the problem.  So much for a Christmas gift ordered early.</li>
    <li> I normally love this fragrance. I have ordered it before on amazon...and it was such a great scent. I&#x27;m afraid this bottle is rancid. The bottle looks like it&#x27;s been around a while and even the perfume itself is discolored...very disappointed. The smell is giving me a headache...I don&#x27;t think I will even be able to use it...so sad.</li>
    <li> I have owned this perfume since I was in high school. Now, six years out, it&#x27;s still one of my favorite scents of all time. It&#x27;s a bit strong for someone who is not used to a deep, rich smell- so if you&#x27;re looking for something light and fluffy, this isn&#x27;t for you. If you want a beautiful scent that honestly will stay will you ALL day, this is something to look into.</li>
    <li> Perfume made for a really nice gift. My sister loved it. It smelled good and it came in a really great bottle.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. I am always getting complimented on how good I smell when I am wearing this.</li>
    <li> This was a stocking stuffer, but it has become her favorite.  It has a very pleasant aroma and isn&#x27;t too overpowering.  Give it a try!</li>
    <li> Very weak I can hardly smell it.</li>
    <li> I was extremely disappointed when I received this perfume that I&#x27;ve been looking for years, and it wasn&#x27;t the same fragrance I remember. The worst part was that the smell made me dizzy and nauseous. I thought that I was probably exaggerating so I tried it again another day and I felt the same dizziness and nauseous feeling again. I had to send it back. Sorry Amazon. Nothing personal.</li>
    <li> My mom&#x27;s (60 yrs old) favorite perfume.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know how old this cologne is but the scent doesn&#x27;t stay with you long. I&#x27;ve purchased this scent before and the scent lasted almost all day, I&#x27;m not very pleased.</li>
    <li> not bad strong smell which attract some one definitely . low cost and good bottle . what you want more then it</li>
    <li> I got this scent years ago from a friend who didnt use it and i fell in love! Everytime i wear it i get nothing but compliments. I have such a hard time finding it and when i do the price is usually 2x what amazon sells it for. I will be stocking up soon!</li>
    <li> This is a great buy! It smells absolutely wonderful. It is just the right size. It was just the right price too.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume...Makes me feel like im in a dark lounge singing the blues...sad thing I cant find it anymore, someone said its discontinued. ? Glad I can buy it online.</li>
