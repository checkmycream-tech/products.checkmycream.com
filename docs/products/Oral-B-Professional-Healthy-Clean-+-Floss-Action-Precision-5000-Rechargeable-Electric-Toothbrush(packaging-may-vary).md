      <li>In addition to the timer, the cleaning power is great.  </li>
      <li>This was a great purchase.  </li>
      <li>And Clock Is A Great Plus</li>
      <li>All the great design work that went into this - yet I would give them an &#x27;F&#x27; for failing on this, from the designer up to the CEO.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After 2 years, the toothbrush still holds a great charge.</li>
      <li>We both always had great reports from our dental hygienist re:</li>

      <li>The un waxed floss scrubs the teeth way better than waxed floss and especially better than Glide.  </li>
      <li>The rest of the time, it&#x27;s a handy clock!</li>
      <li>It is excellent quality and has all the functionality I wanted and more.</li>
      <li>Honestly, I don&#x27;t look at it often, but it is still a nice touch, and I now have a clock in my bathroom. :D    </li>
      <li>I wish you happy, healthy teeth!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I first was a little disappointed, because my old Sonicare was \\&quot;faster\\&quot; in terms of oscillations, but the results, after a couple of weeks, have completely convinced me..The different brush heads are great, teeth feel very clean and the display is a good motivator to brush thoroughly. Besides, the greatest thing about this was that there was a 50%-off mail-in-rebate coupon on the package, I sent it in and expected never to hear from them again. However, a couple of days ago I received my check, considering having paid about 50$ for this after the rebate, I consider this an awesome deal!! I don&#x27;t know if anyone mentioned the rebate in their reviews already, I think this is the number one reason to choose this over comparable electric toothbrushes...</li>
    <li> My wife wanted an electric toothbrush and we got this one.  I got a set of sensitive heads because I have sensitive gums and never tried the other heads.  I like the sensitive heads.  Between flossing and brushing with this thing, my teeth feel almost as clean as walking out of a dentist office.  I used to see plaque build-up between visits behind my lower incisors.  This brush manages to clean that plaque away.  Also, my gums seem healthier.  In the past, I&#x27;d occasionally see bleeding gums while flossing.  I haven&#x27;t seen that recently.    The toothbrush felt funny to use at first.  My teeth felt like they were \\&quot;buzzing\\&quot; a little after brushing.  I don&#x27;t notice that any more.  The handle feels bulky, but I&#x27;m able to maneuver it fine now and I can certainly clean more tooth surfaces with this brush than my old non-electric brush.  What&#x27;s nice is that you simply have to position the brush properly and it vibrates to perform the cleaning.  I like the wireless timer that guides me through brushing 30 seconds in each quadrant.    Set-up could have been easier.  Instructions were so-so and removing the back cover of the clock/timer was more difficult than it should have been.  But, day-to-day use is easy and rewarding.    After using for 6 months, the wireless display became very finicky over batteries.  It goes haywire if the battery isn&#x27;t fully charged.  The first set of batteries lasted 6 months.  I replaced with fresh energizers; they lasted only two months.  I checked the energizers with my multimeter and they register solidly in the \\&quot;good\\&quot; range---the batteries are fine.</li>
    <li> The Oral B 5000 is an excellent device.  It really does a great job of cleaning all of your teeth surfaces and makes them feel smoother.  I believe that in addition to cleaning your teeth, it does a great job of messaging your gums as well.  I highly recommend this for anyone.  btw, the clock that comes with the tooth brush is very helpful in counting down the two minutes that are recommended by the manufacturing for thoroughly cleaning your teeth each time you use the device.</li>
    <li> This portable or AC powered home dental device is definitely worth its price.     It cleans better than other Oral B electric toothbrushes I&#x27;ve tried over the past 11 years.    And, this model was not readily available in all the various stores (Walmart , Walgreen&#x27;s, CVS, etc) which carry Oral B product line;thus, the Amazon order.     Delivery was nearly the next day.</li>
    <li> No problems and works as advertised.  Very thorough cleaning.  After using this tootbrush, you will never want to go back to a regular toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just received the Oral-B SmartSeries 5000 today, and from the very first moment, I felt like it definitely worth the money I spent.     I&#x27;ve bought it in a Goldbox deal for only 80$ so it&#x27;s a bargain in any mean.    back to the unit itself, The way it rotates inside in your mouth as well as the feeling after, is just awesome.  I&#x27;ve showed it to my dentist and he (sorry, she) said that it&#x27;s an amazing toothbrush and she said I will see a big difference comparing to the manual one.  I&#x27;m now leaving it on the charging unit, hope to see it fully recharged by this morning.    Bottom line: Go get one for yourself, and stop wasting your money for less-effective ones.    P.S: will wait till I spend sometime with it, and get this review updated.</li>
    <li> We like the small round head for brushing - handle is easy to hold. - has a setting for tender gums - extra heads - easy to charge - the indicator tells you when low battery - has a timing indicator so can brush your mouth in quadrants - dentist tells us can see the difference - takes care of tea stains on front teeth too!</li>
    <li> Just got this and charged it overnight.  Used it with extreme satisfaction this morning.  My teeth feel great!  Set up was a breeze and using it is easy.  Everything I hoped it would be!</li>
    <li> The product was delivered undamaged and in a timely manner.  I use this toothbrush twice daily.  I am very happy with the quality of this product.  I didn&#x27;t think I would use the remote monitor and clock, but I find it quite nice to see how much time is left and how late I am for work.</li>
    <li> Oral-B powered by Braun is the best electric toothbrush you can ever purchase. If you&#x27;re a sonicare user, switching over to this brand will blow your mind away. It cleans your teeth fantastically, and it really leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean like no other toothbrush in the world. The first time you use the product, you will definitely feel the difference in your mouth, because it will feel much cleaner. It gently massages your gun as well, thus improving gum health. Gum health is directly related to cardiac health by the way, so it is very important to have healthy gums. Overall, I am very satisfied with the purchase, and I promise you that once you start using this toothbrush, there is no going back.</li>
    <li> the battery lasted two recharge and then completely died.   During the two weeks it did work, it brushed good. But after two weeks, this production went to trash can.    Not worth 1/10 of the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the Oral-B Smartseries 5000 for a few weeks now, and am very glad I got it, although it took the 50% off deal to get me to go for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The very first day, I could feel that my teeth were cleaner. I also drink coffee and iced tea, and within the first week, I could see my teeth were noticeably whiter.  Layers of built-up plaque, gone.  Even my gums are looking healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I almost went with the 4000, but am glad I spent a few bucks more for the 5000, because that little clock/timer thing has, for the first time, gotten me to really pay attention to how long I brush, and I dutifully do the full 30 seconds on each quadrant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From what I&#x27;ve read, the only thing to really watch out for are counterfeit brush head replacements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy this toothbrush again?  Absolutely.  Would I recommend it to a friend?  Yep.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had issues with keeping my gum line clean in between my 6 month cleanings.  My dentist recommended that I purchase a Sonicare toothbrush.  Since this was my first electric toothbrush purchase, I did my own research and decided to go with the Oral-B 5000 instead.  After several brushes with the 5000 I could totally notice the difference.  The build up near my gum line is virtually gone and my teeth feel much cleaner.  I also have braces and the standard brush works great with them.  I would recommend this brush to anyone wanting to switch from manual to electric.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the Oral-B Smartseries 5000 and have began to notice a difference in my gums already. Product arrived at my house in great condition, no problems with the packaging. Took some getting use to but after a couple of times it became very easy to use.</li>
    <li> 5 stars for the brush. Minus 1 for including a display that raises the cost of the product without providing any additional value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After just a week of use my teeth feel much cleaner - especially on the backsides / insides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every 30 seconds it vibrates differently for a few moments to let you know to move on to the next section of teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At two minutes it vibrates differently for about a second to let you know that you&#x27;re done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I don&#x27;t see the point of the wireless display. I&#x27;m too busy watching my teeth in the mirror to be looking at the display. There&#x27;s nothing the display can tell you that the toothbrush doesn&#x27;t already, so just go for the cheaper version without the display.</li>
    <li> In the past I have tried and discarded electric toothbrushes because I have a dental partial which leaves spaces when removed. This made it difficult to prevent electric toothbrush spattering even when trying to keep my mouth closed. A mess everywhere! But I decided to try again with my dentist&#x27;s advice and much to my surprise I have no problems with this 5000 toothbrush. I use the \\&quot;clean\\&quot; cycle and don&#x27;t really need the other options. The clock is useful in the bathroom and I like it to time the cleaning of each quadrant and seeing the smily face. A cute gadget and it seems to make the 2 minutes go by very fast. My teeth are exceptionally clean and have a nice feel after brushing. I never thought I would enjoy brushing my teeth, but this toothbrush has really made a difference. It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but I was lucky to catch a 50% off rebate. Look for coupons in the Proctor &amp; Gamble flyer in your Sunday paper for Oral-B accessories such as brush heads etc. Check out [...] for coupons and specials.</li>
    <li> I have used a Sonicare for the past 10 years and thought I would give the Oral B a try. This is a great toothbrush and it it works better than the Sonicare.   Timer system: At first I thought the timer system was a gimmick, but this does help you brush more thoroughly.   Sound: It doesnt seem as loud as the Sonicare. However, all of the good electric toothbrushes make considerable noise.  Function: The floss action works great. It also seems to polish teeth better than the sonicare.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush works great! The storage compartment is too cumbersome.  A simple cover for the brush head would be ideal.  The wireless timer is high maintenance &amp; unnecessary.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric tooth brush. I really like the \\&quot;polished\\&quot; look I get as well as making my gums feel good,just like you feel after visiting the dentist. I have only had it for about a month but so far so good. I did buy an additional head so I can share it. With both of us using it the charge will last about 3 to 4 days. Good choice.</li>
    <li> There are plenty of very detailed reviews that go over the features so I&#x27;ll just give my opinion here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was lucky to purchase this with the fifty percent rebate so I can&#x27;t say that I would have chosen a model this expensive if the reduced price did not factor in. That said I am very pleased with how clean my teeth feel when using this power toothbrush. I had just had a professional cleaning at the dentist within a week of this purchase and I have to say my teeth feel equally as clean when using this toothbrush as when I left the dentist&#x27;s office. Does not ever make my gums bleed or cause irritation. Hold a charge for a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a more budget version of an Oral B, a SonicCare and a Rotadent electric toothbrush in the past and all were very good but I&#x27;d have to say that this one definitely is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pleased with this purchase and highly recommended.</li>
    <li> when I first received the brush and put it on the charger, nothing happened for about 10-15 minutes, i was worried maybe something was wrong with it. but it started charging up after that.&lt;br /&gt;You have to try this, the best ever toothbrushing experience ever! it feels pretty good in your hand and also on your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;very good quality, exactly what i was expecting from oral-b.</li>
    <li> It is the same as my old Oral-B except for the fancy timer. It is a great toothbrush, highly recomend it.</li>
    <li> HAD AN OLDER ORAL B THAT WORKED WELL,SWITCHED TO THE SONICARE WHICH WORKED GOOD FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS,  BOUGHT THIS ORAL B ABOUT A MONTH AGO AND MY TEETH HAVE NEVER FELT CLEANER.I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BRUSH TO ANYONE.</li>
    <li> This product was for my son.  So far, he is very happy with the toothbrush and the results.  Says it is a good value, and it is superior to other brands.  Of course, we have no way of knowing how long it will last.  We&#x27;ve had it a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Absolutely fantastic! I got this toothbrush because I&#x27;ve always had an issue with brushing too hard and have gotten very minor gum recession because of it. It took me a little while to set up (it&#x27;s pretty complicated for a toothbrush), but it was completely worth it. I don&#x27;t think the battery life is too good, but I always charge it after I use it, so it&#x27;s never a big deal. It makes my teeth feel really clean, and it&#x27;s nice to know how long you&#x27;ve been brushing and if you&#x27;re brushing too hard. It&#x27;s an expensive toothbrush, but it&#x27;s excellent if you want to be more conscious about your brushing habits. Totally recommend!</li>
    <li> This a superior product to the previous Oral-B electric toothbrush.  In addition to the timer, the cleaning power is great.  It has a heft and solid feel to it.  Would do it all over again.</li>
    <li> I had never used an electric toothbrush before, so I didn&#x27;t know what to expect.  I bought this toothbrush because of the good reviews and there was a promotion for a 1/2 off rebate.  So, I only paid $51 for it after receiving the rebate.    That being said, I really like this toothbrush and am very happy that I bought it.  It makes my mouth feel so much cleaner than using a manual toothbrush.    I bought my 3 yr old son and 5 yr old daughter a Philips Sonicare for kids and tried that toothbrush.  I did not like the Sonicare toothbrush at all.  The sonicare toothbrush vibrates and it made my mouth feel numb even after I was done using it.  My son wouldn&#x27;t even try the sonicare, and my daughter tried it, but didn&#x27;t like it.  However, my daughter uses the Oral-B every night (She still uses her manual one once a day).  She says she likes the Oral-B.  I bought her some kids replacement heads (I found them on ebay for a really good price).  She likes the smiley face that shows up on the timer after you reach the two minutes.  She even used it longer to see if it would wink at her, which it does.  She watches the timer while I&#x27;m brushing her teeth and I have never had a problem reaching the 2 minute brushing time.    The toothbrush comes with a stand and a place to put four toothbrush heads which is nice.  I have two heads in there for me and one for my daughter.  Once I can convince my son to use the toothbrush, there will be space for his toothbrush head.  I really like the different colored rings that come with the toothbrush heads so that we can keep track of whose heads are whose.    I am so glad that I bought this toothbrush and would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric toothbrush.     I&#x27;ve used it for 2 weeks and I must say, my teeth feel polished, my breath is fresher for longer, and I&#x27;m 99% sure that I removed tartar from the teeth in the back of my mouth that manual toothbrushes can&#x27;t ever reach.    With my tongue, I felt this hard, raggedy stuff stuck to where my teeth and gum-line meet. No matter how hard I picked at it or brushed on it, it would always be there. I google-ed it and found out it must be tartar/calculus, hardened plaque that only a dentist and his tools could remove. Well, two weeks with this toothbrush, I can brush my tongue along the same places and I no longer feel the hard, raggedy stuff--only my smooth, round tooth! I&#x27;m truly amazed.    Notes about the product:  -Packaging was great, easy  -Charger is lightweight   -Travel case is convenient  -Toothbrush is excellent minus one time my grip slipped because the silver portion of the handle is smooth  -Toothbrush heads a bit pricey at $20 for 3, but I got a 2 year pack at Costco at discount  -Charging takes what feels like FOREVER, so charge overnight after it dies   (I re-charge once every week. I read from another reviewer that keeping it charged on the base is no good since the battery lasts only for so many re-charges before it dies and you have to replace your toothbrush entirely)  -I may have been able to make do with the cheaper 4000 version without the Smart Timer thing, but it acts like a clock in my bathroom now    ENJOY!    ***Heads up for REBATES: Make sure to buy with Oral B&#x27;s 50% rebate. However, this \\&quot;rebate\\&quot; is not cash back or a true rebate where the money is refunded to you; rather, it is in a form of a prepaid Visa which annoyed me greatly because instead of getting money back into your accounts, you are forced to spend money on a card that also has Account Maintenance Fees. I was livid as I discovered this this morning after speaking to the Oral B rebates rep who also apparently \\&quot;just learned\\&quot; about the rebate policy changes. She had originally told me all rebates come in a check form, not a card, but after two phone conversations, I now know all rebates come in a card form, not a check.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for \\&quot;just the right\\&quot; item when I ran across this one at Amazon.  Since I was getting 50% rebate, I decided to try it.  It was very easy to set up including the timer.  It works great and the timer allows me to brush my teeth for 2 minutes...........and also shows the time of the day when not brushing.  It comes with a vacation box to use when I am away from home.  Very glad that I purchased this item.</li>
    <li> I have been using this tooth brush for almost 3 months, and I really like it. My teeth have never been more cleaner. It&#x27;s expensive, though.  I found the wireless SmartGuide not that useful, so I recommend SmartSeries 4000 or 3000 if you want to save a few bucks.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is awesome. When I first got it, I was so eager to use it that I didn&#x27;t wait for it to charge fully. I only got about 30 seconds of brushing before the thing died and I was forced to curb my enthusiasm and wait for it to charge. However, after the 30 seconds of using it, I could already feel a huge difference. My teeth felt as polished and clean as they were after a professional hygienist worked on them for 30 minutes. When it was fully charged, I tried again and can I just say WOW. That toothbrush packs a heavy punch. It&#x27;s very high powered, which is just what I need to get all the daily grossness off my teeth.    I bought the toothbrush during Oral-B&#x27;s discount, but I would definitely buy the toothbrush without the discount. After trying this only once, I&#x27;m already in love.     The only complaint I have is with the time it took for the toothbrush to actually arrive at my house. That&#x27;s hardly worth knocking down the rating to four stars though.     If anyone has doubt about whether or not it&#x27;s worth it, I would encourage them to get the toothbrush while the discount is still valid. I&#x27;ll be singing praises about this brush for a long time to come, and I&#x27;ll have an awesome smile to go with it! :)</li>
    <li> Having owned both the sonicare flexcare and the oral b 5000 (which is the same as 4000 except it has a smartguide) I personally think the oral b delivers a more thorough clean. The difference is noticable on how it feels on ur teeth. The oral b oscillates really fast in a rotating motion that really feels like it is scrubbing each teeth individually and it does a good job getting the in-between teeth areas. It also has several different modes and one that I enjoy using after I am done brushing that does short pulses to massage the gums. I also like the one that gradually speeds up and slows down in intervals which is great for use with the polishing brush head. These features are more unique compared to the sonicare which just vibrates.    My mouth feels cleaner after using the oral b compared to the sonicare too. In short the oral b offers a much nicer clean in an easier way. Simply move the brush head from one tooth to the next whereas with the sonicare, u are required to make the traditional oval motion across each tooth.    The only con of the oral b is that the handle is bigger than the sonicare&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> This brush is as described and produces a very clean feeling to the mouth. I definately would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical like most people I imagine when considering a toothbrush for close to 100 bucks!  When it went on sale with a 50% rebate, the gloves were off, and I ordered one.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I went back and forth about getting the display thing.  Honestly, I don&#x27;t look at it often, but it is still a nice touch, and I now have a clock in my bathroom. :D    Pros:    1.Cleans like crazy.  It really does to a great job.    2. Also, I like that it warns you if you are pushing too hard.  I got it, in part, because my dentist said I was brushing too hard.  You just barely hold on to this and let it do all of the work.  It also warns you if you are pressing too hard.  3. It comes with a very handy travel case, so you could travel with it and two different heads.  4. The charger base and extra head organizer if a nice touch.    Cons:   1. I wish it would remember the last mode you use and start in that mode.  I use the gentle mode most often, and I wish I didn&#x27;t have to hit the mode button each time I start it to get to that mode.  That being said, it&#x27;s very simple to do and a habit not.  That is my only thing against it, and it is minor.    I very much like this toothbrush.  I wish I could get more rebates. I would be giving these out as gifts!</li>
    <li> The best electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve tried. Recommended by my oral hygenist, it really cleans my teeth - makes them feel velvety smooth... just like when my hygenist finishes cleaning my teeth. I can&#x27;t get that with any other electric or non-electric toothbrush. The better a product is, the harder I evaluate it and the more nit-picky I become, so here go the suggested improvements: First, the recommended cleaning time is 2 minutes which I believe is way too short. I double that by brushing the lower and upper jaw, each using the times for my entire mouth. Last, the controls are too easy to accidentally hit. This causes the toothbrush to go into another cleaning mode when you didn&#x27;t want it to. I don&#x27;t know how you can fix this except to be careful when holding the toothbrush and not accidentally hit one of the two buttons on the handle. I imagine if they located the controls elsewhere, or made them more difficult to press, I would be complaining about the ergonomics! Maybe a lockout on the end of the brush would help? Excellent toothbrush, charge lasts a long time, slim, light, fairly quiet, brush heads (choice of 4 different heads; comes with two: deep clean and polish) designed to clean deep and in between the teeth. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I love love love this toothbrush!  It is comfortable in my hand and it cleans my teeth thoroughly. The case is great for travel and I also loved the visual timer.</li>
    <li> The last of my 3 Sonicare Advantage electric toothbrush handles died about 2 weeks ago. I got the idea to try to replace the battery but the case has no easy way of opening and my attempt resulted in a shattered case -- it went in my batteries-to-be-recycled bag. I have an Oral-B Vitality I got cheap for under $20 over a year ago because I like to have more than one electric toothbrush (big house). However, it&#x27;s action seemed primitive to me compared to my Sonicares, so I started shopping. Costco has a current coupon on a pair of Sonicares but I decided to look online and see what I could find out and/or buy.  I decided on the Oral-B SmartSeries 5000 in spite of the fact that there appears to be no rebate available for it at this time. The reasons I decided on the 5000 are several. Firstly, it appears to be not difficult to replace the battery when the time comes. The replacement batteries are easily found on ebay and several of those listings (and other YouTube videos) feature  detailed instructions on how to do the replacement. You do have to use a solder iron, but I&#x27;ve been handy with one since I was a teenager, so no big deal. I would not buy another Sonicare if I thought it might not be possible to replace the battery.  Why get the best Oral-B going in spite of the price? I am a frugal guy, extremely so, but in this instance I figure it&#x27;s time to splurge. I have only one set of teeth. The dentist does not scare me, nor the oral surgeon, but I know that the bills can come to literally thousands of dollars. If I obsess a little on my oral hygiene, so much the better! My wallet, teeth, breathe and smile will all benefit! Oh, and my general health. Oral health is a very important part of one&#x27;s overall health.  I discovered that the extra brushes I bought for my Oral-B Vitality will work fine with my 5000, cool!   The Smart Guide? Well, it&#x27;s OK, it&#x27;s a plus, but no biggie. The biggest advantage of it is if you use more than one mode. It shows you which brushing modeyou are using, and it is possible to be in a mode you didn&#x27;t know you were in unless you glance at the Smart Guide. This happened once to me already. I hadn&#x27;t intended to use other than the default mode, but I&#x27;d inadvertently pressed the mode advance button.  When I got the 5000, it had no charge and I set it in the charging cradle but nothing happened and I thought maybe the battery was bad. I&#x27;d looked at the instructions on charging but hadn&#x27;t read down to the short paragraph where it says that the battery icon on the handle&#x27;s LCD may not appear for 10-15 minutes the first time you charge it. I still hadn&#x27;t seen that part of the instructions when I got the idea to place the handle in the charging cradle of my Sonicare brush, thinking the Oral-B&#x27;s might be inoperative. Just a second or two in that cradle gave the battery enough oomph to show the battery icon, I then charged it fully in the Oral-B&#x27;s cradle and everything&#x27;s been fine since.  The Sonicares I had would pulse briefly every 30 seconds and turn off after 2 minutes. The Oral-B does the every-30-second pulsing, but keeps on going when the 2 minutes is up. I like the fact that the Oral-B keeps on going and lets me decide when I want to turn it off.   I picked up mine off ebay for about $12 less than the lowest price I&#x27;ve seen here. The price here has varied by about $10 (i.e. 10%) just over the last week. If I were in no hurry I&#x27;d have waited for another 50% off rebate offer, however.  You have to insert the brush in your mouth before turning it on so as not to spray toothpaste all over.  Likewise, you have to turn it off before removing it from your mouth. After doing that, I place it under running tap water, and while holding it under the stream of water I turn on the brush for a few seconds and let it clean itself of toothpaste, then turn off the tap leaving the brush running for a few more seconds to let it shake off most of the water so it will dry quickly.  I&#x27;ve always brushed before flossing. I always use a dental pick as well (strongly recommended by my dentist and dental hygienist, it&#x27;s the end of a round toothpick, held in a handle called the \\&quot;perio-aid 3\\&quot;, given me by my dentist). A couple of days ago I started wondering if I should really brush first and did an Internet search on the subject and found out that brushing is recommended to come last because dislodging plaque from the tooth/gum-line gives your fluoride toothpaste access to the tooth surfaces, re-mineralizing those surfaces, making them more resistant to decay. So, now I&#x27;m brushing last.</li>
    <li> It is only a month or so old.  So far it is very good.  Multiple brushing methods are quite different.The smiley gauge showing time brushed vs. time remaining is nice.  Unit is a bit heavy in my hand but  not an issue.</li>
    <li> I have used Oral-B electronic toothbrushes for over 10 years... my old one was finally starting to lose its battery, so I researched and decided on this model (the 50% gift card cash back was definitely nice).  I just started using it and it definitely has some extra power that my old one didn&#x27;t have.  It is a bit loud, so if you have sensitive ears, be warned of that.  It charged fast and is holding its battery power well (I don&#x27;t charge it every time I use it).  I brush for 3 minutes and use the 30 second timers for back, top/bottom, right/left, then the extra minute for my front top and bottom... I thought I would hate the 30 second timer and find it annoying, but turns out its really handy to brush each of the areas long enough.  I haven&#x27;t used the little clock thing as I tend to walk around as I brush, but I imagine it would be good for those adjusting to electric toothbrushes and/or kids.  I also probably won&#x27;t use the extra brush holder as my medicine cabinet doesn&#x27;t have the room.  The travel case will definitely come in handy and the small charger is a nice change from my old clunky one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;*Great clean&lt;br /&gt;*30 second pauses and 2 minute longer pause&lt;br /&gt;*Small charger&lt;br /&gt;*Travel case&lt;br /&gt;*Should help your dentist visits!!&lt;br /&gt;*Pressure notification (if you are brushing too hard, it gives some warning, but I haven&#x27;t experienced it)&lt;br /&gt;*Separate timer would be good for kids or those new to electronic brushes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;*Louder than my old model&lt;br /&gt;*Extra stuff... not sure many people need the brush holder, only some will use the separate timer&lt;br /&gt;*New heads are expensive</li>
    <li> I love love love love love the brush! I have been debating getting an electric toothbrush but did not want to spend the money; when I did and began using it I was AMAZED! After I am done using it I feel like I just left the dentist and has began to whiten my teeth! I say it&#x27;s well worth the money!!! GO FOR IT!</li>
    <li> The oral-b has a small head so it fits comfortably in my wifes mouth and has been sensitive enough to do a thorough cleaning with no irritation.  We have traveled with it as well as used it at home and it has been an excellent purchase.</li>
    <li> Does what it says it does. We had an older Braun Oral B electric toothbrush that gave out after MANY years. We both always had great reports from our dental hygienist re: our teeth/gums. I definitely wanted another Braun product. This one is wonderful. It comes with an extra little timer thing but we haven&#x27;t used it (too busy to read the directions). However, a timer is built into the brush itself, and a \\&quot;warning\\&quot; change in the action if you brush too hard. I can&#x27;t say enough about it.</li>
    <li> I bought this on sale at Wal-Mart for a really great price (cheaper than the 4000 series). Personally I would not pay extra for the \\&quot;wireless smart guide\\&quot; feature as the brush itself beeps after each 30 second interval, which is included in the 4000 series. [[ASIN:B002HWS9GQ Oral-B Professional Care SmartSeries 4000 Electric Rechargeable Power Toothbrush]]  The brush itself is worth of a 5-star rating because it cleans great, it helps me brush properly (amount of time and pressure), and has helped me eliminate gingivitis and reduce tooth sensitivity.</li>
    <li> You would think that as much as this thing costs, they would have included another set of brushes for the other person in the family! Also, what&#x27;s with the timer and other automatic features. I can&#x27;t see anyone using them for more than a couple of days. I&#x27;ve been brushing my teeth for 70 years and have never needed them.</li>
    <li> My son purchased this toothbrush and had nothing but great things to say about it. After about a week of using it, I was sold on it! I could tell a big difference in just those few days of him using it. So I decided I had to have one. My son bought this as a gift for me, and I can honestly say that my teeth and mouth have never felt so fresh and clean. I actually look forward to brushing with my Oral B 5000. It feels as good if not better than after you&#x27;ve gone to have your teeth cleaned at the dentist. It thoroughly cleans teeth and gums and the areas I was always unable to reach with any other toothbrush in the past. A little costly most would think for toothbrush but believe me it&#x27;s worth every cent</li>
    <li> Pro care 5000 toothbrush works great.  As with most things,  the directions make more sense after you&#x27;ve used the product a few times.  Only downside is cost of replacement brushes</li>
    <li> The flosser head and whitening head are a bit much. I would rather have had a set of regular heads, but I guess it&#x27;s a good way to advertise the options. I bought a set of sensitive heads for my 4yo to use and my husband uses those as well if he uses the electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used any of the other modes other than the default: daily cleaning? But that seems adequate. (I don&#x27;t go to the dentist so hopefully this makes up for it. Shame, shame)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly I used the clock part once, then we went on vacation and haven&#x27;t used it since. I&#x27;ll try it again once my son starts using it more often, but for now I&#x27;m the only one using the toothbrush. Kinda spendy for a one person tooth brush, but I don&#x27;t regret it since it is so versatile and my boys will start using it when their manual toothbrushes are used up.</li>
    <li> I am very annoyed with Proctot and Gamble. I waas offered a 50%rebate but did not know what a UPC is and threw away the box so they refused to reconsider the matter. I have all other details and as a non American I did not understand what this is. The supervisor I spoke to was very off hand about the matter so I will not buy any of their products in future.</li>
    <li> I purchased Oral-B Smartseries 5000 for myself and I love it! Now I get one more as a gift for my son in law.My 4 year grandson love to use this toothbrush to, so I am going to get one for him.</li>
    <li> MAKES YOU WANT TO BRUSH 3 TIMES A DAY FOR 10 MINS A TIME.....FEELS LIKE YOU JUST WALKED OUT THE DENTIST OFFICE....WHAT COFFEE STAINS?</li>
    <li> Love my new toothbrush!  I replaced an Oral-B electric toothbrush that I had for many years and can&#x27;t beleive the difference.</li>
    <li> I think its one of the best investments I&#x27;ve ever made... it is worth spending north of $150 for something like this but under $60 now with the rebate is a steal.</li>
    <li> The Oral-B Smartseries 5000 Professional Care Rechargeable toothbrush was recommended by my dentist, following my last cleaning. Since the dentist reported some \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; areas to watch, that had not been brushed as thoroughly, I decided to take the plunge and invest in this toothbrush. The toothbrush comes with a charger and clock/timer for each of your cleaning sessions. This not only monitors how long you are cleaning, but, has a little red light that is illuminated when you are brushing too hard. What&#x27;s more, once you have reached the two minute mark, a smiley face appears on the digital timer. So helpful! I look forward to following up with my dentist in six months, to track my progress. Once you have been brushing with this toothbrush, diligently, for three weeks, plaque is supposed to diminish. I am already feeling that my teeth are cleaner, compared to brushing with a \\&quot;manual\\&quot; brush alone.  Well done, Oral-B.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my father last Christmas - I was also able to get a 50% rebate on this unit - a great deal!</li>
    <li> This product is really great!!.  It&#x27;s cleaning of your teeth is superior and leaves your mouth feeling really fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product about 6 months now, and am very pleased with it.  My teeth feel cleaner, and I hope my breath is more pleasant.  It gets the hard-to-remove film from the teeth, and does not require the hard brushing of a regular toothbrush.  The bristles initially felt too hard, but it&#x27;s just a matter of getting accustomed to the toothbrush.    Although this toothbrush cleans the teeth well I cannot emphasize enough the importance of continuing to floss between the teeth.  The timer that comes with the device is not necesssary as there is a slight change in speed after each 30 seconds of brushing, but I do find it helpful for me.    I keep my brush on the charger, but find it works fine without the charger when I&#x27;m out of town over a week. If you keep it plugged in make sure the brush is seated properly or it will overheat. When used in conjunction with the Oral Breeze Quick Breeze (faucet attachment) it makes for a really clean-feeling mouth. (The Oral Breeze helps to remove food debris from under caps and bridges, and really rinses the mouth well).   Floss, brush, rinse, smile!</li>
    <li> Okay, I was never a non-brusher, don&#x27;t have problem teeth or gums, and have always practiced basic daily dental hygiene. Still, I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS ORAL B brush! First of all, it&#x27;s clever as can be--the charging base in sleek and unobtrusive, and the visual icon for the battery level really helps. Being able to see the brushing guide combined with the indication from the brush itself telling me when to continue on to the other \\&quot;quadrant\\&quot; of teeth is super effective. I didn&#x27;t realize how scantily I&#x27;d been brushing in the past until I used this device. And WOW do my teeth ever feel clean and polished! I can think of absolutely NOTHING negative to say about this cool brush. I was skeptical about spending this much money, but I feel it is well-worth the money. Until you use this brush, you won&#x27;t realize that your old Oral B model isn&#x27;t cutting it...I heartily recommend this Smartseries 5000.</li>
    <li> I have never owned an electric toothbrush before, but I love this one. I have always scrubbed my teeth until the enamel was coming off, and I still had coffe stains. One use of this and alot of those stains were removed. I would definitly recommend this to anyone looking to keep their mouth healthy and clean.</li>
    <li> I had a Triumph that died a couple of months ago and picked this up. It&#x27;s quite good, has a bit more power than the previous generation and good battery life. The little gimmick clock/timer actually is pretty useful, especially as I brush in the shower. I can use it to keep an eye on the time while showering and makes sure I brush as long as I need to. Also, it winks at me for a really long brush. So, if you want a little happy face winking at you for doing a great job on brushing your teeth, clearly the choice is before you.</li>
    <li> First of all I&#x27;m sorry, I&#x27;m usually the one to get on peoples&#x27; case when it comes to submitting product reviews and when it comes to vendor review, but in this case I think EVERYONE should know something about this item that amazon stocks.  I purchased this \\&quot;brand new\\&quot; from amazon&#x27;s own add to cart.  I did NOT purchase it used from another vendor or seller.  When I received the item it was shipped in the actual box that houses the item.  The item is in a refurbished box. YES, a toothbrush being sold refurbished (gross). It&#x27;s NOT sold via amazon (at the time of this review) as a new item in the RETAIL packaging. I confirmed this when I took it out the toothbrush had smudge marks and had brown smears on the chrome. On top of that the timer was on !!! Jeez, I can&#x27;t believe amazon is doing this, I&#x27;ve had amazing experience with them up until this point.  For some reason they&#x27;re stocking refurbished items and selling them off as new?  Please buy on \\&quot;the bay\\&quot; it&#x27;s cheaper and it&#x27;s in retail packaging not some white non-descript box. And this is refurbished because my father who used to work for Sony had refurbished items he would bring home in the exact same packaging style. Sad Amazon.</li>
    <li> The device itself works wonderfully -- However it was shipped to me without the original box which kept me from getting at $10 rebate from the manufacturer. Great reviews for the product but not so good for the provider</li>
    <li> I was using an Oral B Sonic Complete, but its rechargeable battery was getting tired and not holding a charge very long, so I figured it was time to get a new one.  Oral B has discontinued the Sonic line.  So, I tried the Professional Care/Smart Series - what an improvement!  I like it much better than the Sonic Complete.  It brushes much more thoroughly.    On the downside, it is a bit louder (not a big deal) and the RPM drops noticeably as the days go by until I recharge it.  (I don&#x27;t leave it in the charger after every use, only when the battery is almost dead).    I went with the 5000 over the lower models because the price was insignificantly higher at the time.  I will admit that I don&#x27;t use the advanced features that the 5000 has over the lower models.  The massaging and other brushing modes don&#x27;t impress me; I just use the regular mode.  (I used to use the soft mode on the Sonic Complete, but I don&#x27;t have a problem with the aggressiveness of the regular mode in the 5000).  The clock/brushing timer is interesting for the first couple of weeks, but now I totally ignore it.  Kind of nice to have a clock in the bathroom when you are getting ready for work, that&#x27;s the only benefit.  The quality of the toothbrush and the clock unit is very impressive.    I use the soft headed brushes.    I have been using the toothbrush for six months now.  Dentist report was \\&quot;all ok\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Received my Oral B 5000 about a month ago and have been really happy with it.  Like the Smart Guide/Clock timer because I used to walk around the house for the two minutes until the pulse timer went off so I never knew if I was missing spots - now I stay pretty much on track. It is a little confusing at first but it&#x27;s not really difficult to use. I&#x27;m not exactly a rocket scientist so if I can do it anyone can.  There are a number of things that you have to learn and get used to and decide what the most comfortable settings are for you.  I will get a couple of the recommended brushes, especially the \\&quot;floss\\&quot; brush.  They are fairly expensive but I think they last a long time.  The unit is a tad heavy in comparison to my old Oral B, but it didn&#x27;t take long to get use to.  I think my teeth look brighter and feel cleaner than with any other brush I&#x27;ve ever used.  Hope my dentist agrees!!!</li>
    <li> Bought two back in September of last year, mailed on time with rebate voucher and UPC and never received the rebate check.</li>
    <li> ORAL B has the best products for dental hygiene. Buying on Amazon is even better, great prices and it&#x27;s delivered to the house. Don&#x27;t buy any other electric toothbrush, this product does the job far better than any other.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush for my teenage son under our dentist&#x27;s advice and he loves it. It comes with different heads that help to get a better clean that normal brushes can&#x27;t offer, specially if you have braces.</li>
    <li> I selected this product after researching online - it was the second best rated but substantially less expensive than the top rated product. I am very pleased with it. It is excellent quality and has all the functionality I wanted and more. It is well designed and holds its charge a long time which makes it excellent for travel too. Five Stars!</li>
    <li> Works great and like that fact that if I accidentally hit the button that shuts it off I can turn it back on and I don&#x27;t loose my time on the timer, better than the old one.</li>
    <li> Pros: charger is a compact size and will be convenient for travel; wireless smart guide makes it easy to see how long you&#x27;ve been brushing; charge level display makes it easy to know when to recharge.    Cons: the brush modes don&#x27;t feel as comfortable to me as the Sonic Complete; small brush head doesn&#x27;t feel comfortable either.    I&#x27;ve only had the new toothbrush for about a week. So far, I still prefer the Sonic Complete, despite its bulky charger stand/refill storage tower.</li>
    <li> It is awesome. Its strong but gently, I can feel my mouth so clean!  Just love it. Happy face at the end its the cherry upon the cake :)</li>
    <li> I bought this recently after got a recommendation from my dentist.  Product works as advertised, got a great price and even applied for a rebate, which will provide me almost 50% off of what I paid.</li>
    <li> I have no idea why oral b decided to have wireless display for a toothbrush. Wasn&#x27;t the LCD display on the brush itself good enough? The wireless display is a joke in my opinion considering it is not even back-lit. Secondly, the battery is HORRIBLE for this brush. It takes minimum 14-16 hours to re-charge it and it doesn&#x27;t even last for more than 3 days. I had a sonicare toothbrush before and battery lasted for 15 days and got charged within 6 hours. The dual-action head is so BIG that a normal person can&#x27;t even fit the brush in his mouth. I would expect lot more things if I am paying this much for just a toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I bought this tooth brush simply because it was 1/2 off (Oral-B deal). Initially I didn&#x27;t like it much because I was still used to the old style brush. But after using it for couple of months I can see the difference. My teeth have stopped bleeding and I am so satisfied with this product at this price.</li>
    <li> Generally, it is a good and  easy using oral health care gare. But I am busy in every morning, only have 1 min to brush teeth, so i could not injoy the \\&quot;smart brush processing\\&quot; very will(it usually cost 2 min)</li>
    <li> Bought this 6 months ago and my oral hygiene has improved significantly! I have been a Sonicare users for years but I never liked it, finally my dentist recommended this brush to me and I am now in love. I also converted my husband to be an Oral B user as well!</li>
    <li> My best friend is in his final year as a dental student.  He recommended to me these following products:    1.  Crest Pro-Health Whitening Toothpaste, 4.2-Ounce Carton (Pack of 6),   2.  ACT Restoring Mouthwash, Cool Splash Mint, 18-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 4)   3.  Crest Pro-health Multi-Protection Alcohol Free Clear/Clean Mint, 1-liter Bottles (Pack of 3).    4.  Reach unwaxed dental floss by Johnson &amp; Johnson  5.  Oral-B Triumph Professional Care Electric Toothbrush.   This is the regiment he advised me to follow:  1. Use the toothpaste morning and evening.  2. Use the Act mouthwash in the morning because it has a really potent amount of fluoride in it and it&#x27;s the best time of day for using fluoride.  3. Use the Crest mouthwash at night because it has a protective film it leaves on your teeth to prevent plaque from building at night.  4. Use the Un Waxed floss once per day at night prior to the mouthwash.  The un waxed floss scrubs the teeth way better than waxed floss and especially better than Glide.  The reason is the Glide \\&quot;glides\\&quot; right past the plaque and food build up leaving the teeth unclean.  The un waxed floss is not for the faint of heart and will take a few weeks to get used to.  It is harder to use because it \\&quot;grips\\&quot; the teeth and you do have to use a sawing left to right motion to get it between some close teeth.  But, it&#x27;s way worth the effort.  After months of using the un waxed, I don&#x27;t even think about it!  5. I used to use the Sonicare for years but my friend convinced me that the Oral-B Triumph cleans better and it does if you do the research.  This model also has a handy 4 stage 30 second prompt so you don&#x27;t have to wonder \\&quot;did I brush good enough\\&quot;. It tells you when you are done!  CONCLUSION:  My dentist friend says that if you follow this routine, you will probably never have a cavity again!    I have read a lot of criticism about some of the products on this list but, they seem to be from people who have poor dental hygiene.  I use the tooth paste with the electric toothbrush on high and have had no problems whatever.  My teeth are clean and gums healthy.  Once you get through \\&quot;the tunnel\\&quot; using this type of regiment, your gums will never bleed and you will have great oral care!  I wish you happy, healthy teeth!</li>
    <li> Simply put, this brush is great.  My teeth feel clean after every brush and it stays that way the whole day. Like any other toothbrush, it is easy to use. It last quite awhile before recharge (once a week).    With the brush, you use either a daily 2 minute or 3 minute brush. I recommend using the 3 minute brush simply because I can not reach every spot in my mouth in 2 minutes. However, even when using the two minute wash, your mouth will feel cleaner than a 5 minute wash with a manual brush.  That&#x27;s all folks.</li>
    <li> it very good this item but the only is that tthe tooth brush is not as fast as i thought</li>
    <li> One of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made.  I bought this brush last October, and I loved it from the moment I received it.  After the first use, your teeth feel like you just came from the dentist after a professional cleaning.  I just came from my first check-up since using this brush, and the dentist was amazed how clean my teeth were.  Highly recommended!!!</li>
    <li> I have had some lower end brushes, but this one was recommended to me by my dentist. This brush really helps get all the plaque off of my teeth and makes it really easy to ensure that I hit all the quadrants of my mouth.</li>
    <li> Well, I ordered it because my husband&#x27;s dentist strongly recommended it. And, since it came with more than one brush (color coded so as not to have a mix up.. ewwwww right?) I gave it a try too.  I LOVE IT.  Not only do you get a better cleaning, you get it in less time. It really is a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I am highly satisfied with the construction quality/materials, the effectiveness and the replacements parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The external display is actually of great help to stick to a routine and - not last - it looks good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve thoroughly enjoyed this toothbrush as it has thoroughly clean my teeth. It feels like I&#x27;ve just been to the dentist.</li>
    <li> Tooth brosh will not hold a charge and the \\&quot;applying excessive pressure\\&quot; warning light is on even when not brushing.  this product did not show any signs of been used, but is definitely defective.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my 5000 toothbrush for a few years now.  It was recommended by my dentist.  I have had flawless checkups since using it.  The brush itself has always been reliable and I haven&#x27;t had a single complaint.</li>
    <li> I purchased my Oral-B Smartseries 5000 through Amazon.com about 30 days ago.  It arrived within 7 days and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since.  I originally had planned on purchasing a Phillips Sonicare toothbrush but after reading many different reviews, decided on the Oral-B instead.  The clock/timer is a nice feature, makes me more aware of how much time I spend on different sections of teeth.  The motor hesitates when too much pressure is applied which is also a plus for me as I have a tendency to press too hard.  I&#x27;ve been using the 3-minute timer feature and the battery charge has lasted about a week using it once a day during the week and twice a day on weekends (I still use my old fashioned toothbrush at work after lunch).  I don&#x27;t use the stand that it came with but it&#x27;s not necessary as the unit stands on its own fine.  The battery charging ring doesn&#x27;t take up hardly any more space than the base of the toothbrush.  I do wish that they would have included some sort of UV light sanitizer case as I&#x27;ve seen with some of the Phillips Sonicare, then I might have a use for the stand/case.  Also, I already received my refund card from P&amp;G as well, which was much quicker than some other people had reported in their reviews.  I would definitely buy another if this one went bad and would recommend to anyone looking to purchase this type of toothbrush.</li>
    <li> UPDATE: Received my Rebate, very trustworthy. Bought in retail box, got 50% of my money back. No GC or extra credit used.   This is my first electric toothbrush and WOW, it&#x27;s probably the best thing I&#x27;ve ever bought to take care of my teeth. My teeth is definitely cleaner! Would recommend to anyone who doesn&#x27;t have an electric toothbrush or needs to get a new one! I ordered the retail version (should have gotten the Frustration Free which came with extra brush heads!).  It comes with this extra guide that counts to 2 minutes (which is the optimal brushing time) and flashes a smiley face after you&#x27;re done. I don&#x27;t really use it, since the brush reminds me of the time every 30 seconds by stuttering for a couple seconds. After 2 minutes it stutters a little more to let you know that you&#x27;ve been brushing for 2 minutes.  The other triangular button on the brush lets you switch between modes: normal, sensitive teeth, and whitening? I&#x27;ve only used normal, but the different modes would be great for people who may have sensitive teeth!  I LOVE this toothbrush. My teeth are noticeably whiter and definitely less tartar-y.  BUY IT! Highly recommended! Amazon shipped my product super fast too, props to them! Got an extra 50% off rebate from Oral-B as well. Actually waiting for it, but the 50% off Rebate promo ends September 15, so get on it! I heard that the UPC code for the rebate is attached to the Frustration Free packaging as well, so if you want a good deal, get the Frustration Free for extra brush heads (which are super expensive) and 50% off!</li>
    <li> I got this toothbrush about 1 month ago its design and features are the best and after 1 month feel that my tooth are more shiny than before</li>
    <li> The Oral-B Samartseries 5000 is everything as advertised. I am especially impressed with the high speed rotating head that is so much more efficient than the manual tooth brush I was using before. The lock and 2 minute timer has been very helpful as well. I certainly recommend  this product highly.</li>
    <li> this toothbrush is fantastic! my teeth have never felt so clean. it&#x27;s easy to use and sturdy. highly recommend product.</li>
    <li> This is a great toothbrush that has performed very well for the last 1.5 years or so, but the battery is dying now (requires charging frequently), and I just learned that there is no easy way to replace the battery. There are youtube videos that demonstrate hack jobs requiring the user to break the seals and remove solder points and circuit board components, but I don&#x27;t consider that to be a user friendly service by any means. This is a serious design flaw that one might suspect as being intentional (a battery costs about twenty bucks, but Braun/Oral-B would probably rather sell a whole new system for over a hundred bucks). This also makes it difficult to recycle the battery apart from the rest of the plastic and electronics. This is not a green technology and it is obvious that Braun/Oral-B do not care about customers or the environment very much. I would avoid doing business with companies like this, which is a shame since they could offer what would otherwise be great products.</li>
    <li> My wife and I decided to purchase our first electric toothbrushes for a more thorough cleaning.  After two months, we are still very happy with the product.  The battery lasts about 6 days between charges. The recharging station is very convenient.  I wish I&#x27;d switched years ago as I am a hard brusher and have worn my enamel considerably.  The brush heads seem to wear well.  I am still using the first one).  We don&#x27;t use the timer piece - not sure why anyone would use it.</li>
    <li> I really have enjoyed this toothbrush and would highly recommend it to anyone who wants their teeth to be cleaner.</li>
    <li> My old oral-b toothbrush had died and I had every intention to purchase the exact same one again until I stumbled upon this one. It is completely worth the extra $. I get a much higher quality brushing experience. The indicator is  fantastic about telling you if you are brushing too hard (which I was doing a lot). It has a much longer battery life and the traveling case is very convenient.</li>
    <li> had a sonicare for 4years before it quit and this is a better brush by far. Amazon shipping was fast. D.A.Chmielewski LOL,FL.</li>
    <li> Our old power toothbrush was no longer holding a charge and it was time to get a new one.  After reading quite a few reviews, I settled on this one.  No regrets!  My teeth feel nice and clean after using it.  My husband loves the little timer with the smiley face when you brush more than two minutes.  I love the stand with the nice little case to hold the individual toothbrushes.  I had my check up this week...no cavities.  Just a clean (literally) bill of dental health.  :)</li>
    <li> After a particularly painful cleaning at the dental hygienist, I ordered this toothbrush. Both my fiance and myself use it and we could not be happier with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inside the box you will find a the toothbrush, a charger with a base you can separate for travel, a \\&quot;Floss Action\\&quot; head, a \\&quot;Pro White\\&quot; head, a travel case, and the Smart Guide (with an additional set of batteries).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charge lasts about 4 days for both of us brushing twice a day. The strength of the brushing on \\&quot;normal\\&quot; mode is certainly not gentle, but then again, that&#x27;s what the \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; mode is for. We always use the normal mode and we&#x27;ve had no issues. The \\&quot;Floss Action\\&quot; heads seem to work quite well to remove some of the inter-dental debris, but flossing is still necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were a little skeptical about the SmartGuide, but since buying this toothbrush was part of our plan to improve dental hygiene, we decided to give it a shot. We mounted it on the bathroom wall next to the mirror. The thing quickly detects when you start brushing and shows you a diagram and a timer, so you know how long you need to brush. The rest of the time, it&#x27;s a handy clock! We actually really like it. It was worth spending a few extra bucks to get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it was a great purchase and a huge step up from using a regular toothbrush. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> this is the first electric toothbrush i have used so i cannot compare it to others in the same category, but it beats the hellout of a manual toothbrush. I felt the difference the first time i used it.a few weeks into using it i had to use a regular brush for a weekend trip for which i forgot to pack my brush and again i was quickly reminded of what i was missing. Great clean feeling. multiple modes for desired cleaning. 30 second timer is very helpful too.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this Oral B Smartseries 5000 product. They sold it for $120 before tax with a $10 rebate. It would come in a nice professional package and DVD demonstration video. I trusted the Amazon equivalent purchasing option for $100 (no sales tax). I received the unit in 6 business days. I was surprised the Amazon unit came in a \\&quot;brown plain wrapper\\&quot; type box. There was no DVD and no product ID info to clip to sent to the Oral B rebate form processing. The unit works fine and the unit comes from a Proctor and Gamble source (they own the Oral B brand). For $10 more, I think I should of bought the unit from my dentist for some hand holding and product support comfort.</li>
    <li> I am sure that the actual toothbrush is good but when I received my first one it came in the box dead on arrival.  Thankfully Amazon has awesome customer service and I was sent a replacement in one day.  The next one that came worked for one day until it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge long enough to even get through a brushing.  I upgraded from a Oral B brush that took 10 years to kill the battery.  I am going to stick to the cheaper spin toothbrushs because it is disappointing to get two duds.</li>
    <li> First off I&#x27;m a dentist.  I&#x27;ve never recommended electronic toothbrushes in the past since their benefit over a regular toothbrush had not been scientifically proven in studies (the American Dental Assoc had called a tooth brush a fluoride applicator).  A crest representative came to my office, presented information that made sense and had literature that this brush was the only toothbrush to show increased efficacy in independent testing.  Anyway I bought several for my parents and myself and have been impressed.  What I like:  -Makes your teeth \\&quot;feel\\&quot; noticeably cleaner, like they feel when they&#x27;ve just been cleaned at the dental office  -Wireless display motivates me to brush longer than I normally would, I&#x27;ll be honest I don&#x27;t know where they got the recommended 2 minute timeframe, but I do it to see the smiley face on the indicator  -Wireless display has PRESSURE INDICATOR; I diagnose wear on teeth at the gum line multiple times everyday.  If this is an issue for you get this brush.  It&#x27;ll save you money at the dentist and stop you from harming your teeth  -Well made, handle is thin and ergonomic, charger has a small footprint on the counter, no electrical components exposed and everything feels sturdy  -Wide selection of brush heads that are reasonably priced ($40 for a 2 year supply at Costco).  Two heads stand out to me.  The first is the funky looking one, which actually provides a floss like action between teeth.  NOT a substitute for flossing but I have noticed considerably less debris removed when I do floss after using this brush.  Also there is an orthodontic (braces) brush that gets in-between the teeth and the braces.  If you are plunking down the thousands for your child to have braces get this brush / attachment, otherwise when the braces a removed there is a good chance the teeth will have unsightly white halos around where the brackets were which is actually decalcification which is the start of cavities.  Overall I&#x27;m very impressed with this brush so it is most defiantly \\&quot;dentist recommended\\&quot; by myself.  My parents absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> I got this today.  Its replacing a rotadent my dentist sold me 4 years ago.  After one brushing I can already tell the difference.  My mouth feels incredibly clean.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement from a previous Oral-B toothbrush.  I thought the previous model was excellent (I had it for about 7-8 years).  This new model is even better.</li>
    <li> This is the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used and my mouth always feel like I just came from a cleaning at the dentist and my teeth have gotten noticeably whiter. It takes a few days to get used to not using the same rigorous back and forth brushing action, but you get used to it. The secret is in the reciprocating action that allows the brush to get between teeth in ways a normal brush cannot. It also cleans those tough back molars extremely well. The included charger is also 110-220v which is a nice feature for someone who travels a lot and lives in Europe like myself. I was also a little apprehensive about the wireless timer/clock, but after using it for awhile it makes a lot of sense and I like using it. I wish they would include an alarm clock or multiple timezones in future iterations to make it more travel friendly and usable. If there were any downside to this toothbrush it would be in it&#x27;s travel \\&quot;footprint\\&quot;. Although the case is very nice and holds the brush and two heads, its much larger than a regular brush and will take up more space while traveling. The additional wireless timer adds additional packing requirements (which is why I recommend that they add some more features to the clock to make it more usable and travel friendly). If you don&#x27;t travel much, then the size will be fine for your bathroom and the included stand is nice, functional, and compact. Overall, I strongly recommend this toothbrush to anyone who wants to bring their oral hygiene to the next level. It&#x27;s a little pricey for a toothbrush, but I guarantee your teeth will feel considerably cleaner and look whiter after using it for only a week or two. Great product!</li>
    <li> Second electric I have owned. By far, better than first. Includes regular head and polishing cup head. Leaves teeth, gums feeling like they&#x27;ve been cleaned by hygienist ( almost). The separate timer may be overkill, but I&#x27;m getting used to it. Would definitely buy this appliance again.</li>
    <li> In the picture of this product you see a tooth brush on this machine.  However for $109.99, it comes with OUT a tooth brush.  How ridiculous is that??</li>
    <li> I bought this toothbrush after a visit to the dentist&#x27;s office. I decided I wanted the clean fresh feeling I get there all the time. This toothbrush doesn&#x27;t give me the exact feeling, but it&#x27;s pretty damn close! Great toothbrush and I love the timer because there is NO WAY I was coming close to the proper amount of time to brush. Yes, the brush holder gets kind of gross after a while, but I just make sure I clean it with some rubbing alcohol once every 2 weeks. No biggie. This is really a great toothbrush. Yes, it is expensive, but it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this toothbrush for over a month now.  Initially it took some getting used to an electric/electronic toothbrush vs. a manual, but it really does a superb job.  My teeth feel like I&#x27;ve been to a dentist for a cleaning after using it.  Has a handy timer/wall clock unit to tell you when you&#x27;ve reached the two minute recommended brushing time, but I always exceed that since I like a good scrubbing on the choppers.    No issues at all so far with the unit.  The real test will be when I return to my dentist (who had in fact recommended this unit) and see if the cleaning is shorter or if they notice any difference.    I&#x27;ll update after that happens.    Overall, I&#x27;m completely pleased and think that it&#x27;s probably a good investment.  Also, and it may be my imagination, but I think my teeth are whiter now than they used to be.    I would recommend this (and have) to my friends.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm. My teeth were whiter almost instantly. The only thing I have yet to master is the timer - can&#x27;t quite figure it out. Otherwise, the case is great for travel, the round head with polisher really does the job and the toothbrush itself holds a charge well.</li>
    <li> Oral-B Professional Care SmartSeries 5000 Rechargeable Toothbrush]]    This was a great purchase.  At first I thought it was crazy to spend about $120.00 on a toothbrush, but I&#x27;m glad I did. I was probably like alot of you who used the regular toothbrushes that only cost about $3.00 or so.  About a month ago my dentist asked me what kind of toothbrush I use.  Told him just a plain jane toothbrush which I switch out every 3 months or so.  He recommended that I purchase an electric one because he&#x27;s a firm believer in them.  He told me what kind he had, which was the Smartseries 4000 Rechargeable made by Oral-B.   He said there are several different price ranges, styles, and brands.  One of the many features I like on mine is the wireless SmartGuide which has a personalizing timer on it.  This helps you brush all four quadrants of your mouth equally. 5 brushing modes- Daily Clean, Sensative, Massage, Whitening, and Deep Clean.  It also has an idicator that lights up when too much pressure is being applied, this is a great feature because I was brushing too hard with my regular toothbrush which caused my gums to bleed.  Since I&#x27;ve been using my Oral-B Professional Care SmartSeries 5000 I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it, no bleeding gums, and my teeth feel as though I just came from a cleaning at the dentist.  If there is a Con it would be that I had to purchase the precision clean head seperately because it only comes with the floss action and ProWhite heads.  However you also get a 5.00 off coupon to save money on your additional heads you might purchase.  Over all I&#x27;m more than happy with the product and Amazon.com didn&#x27;t waste anytime getting it sent to me.  I hope this helps any possible future buyers. Semper FI</li>
    <li> I have used this toothbrush for several weeks now and it works very well for me. It is the fourth Oral-B toothbrush that I have purchased and my favorite so far. It signals every 30 seconds for my brushing progress and comes with a visual countdown to two minutes of brushing. It is dual voltage, so I can travel to other countries and continue to use it. Also a very good price.</li>
    <li> I debated a long time before deciding to get this toothbrush and now that I have it I love it.  It&#x27;s the best thing I have done for my teeth except for routine dental care.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The best thing since sliced bread. I feel like I just had my teeth cleaned by a hygienist EVERY time.</li>
    <li> Great brush! And lots of fun to use it. The first setting was too hard for me so I used the second one. After 2 weeks I swithed again. My teeth feel like satin and they are whiter and whiter every day so I smile again :) :) :).  The only thing I did not like it was that I was charged by Amazon \\&quot;Import Fee Deposit\\&quot; of $13.73 on top of S&amp;H .     I ordered before from Amazon and never had this charge, it must be something new. So I won&#x27;t use this site again.  The item was pricy enough without this additional \\&quot;deposit\\&quot;. I can get a better deal on E-Bay.  So bye bye Amazon.    Barb</li>
    <li> The product I received was in good shape,there was no damage or missing parts.But I found one of the item called Oral B Smart Guide that has been used because there were 2 batteries already inserted to that item.The batteries were dead and there are 2 new fresh batteries found in the shipping package. The buttons on the toothbrush has water marks and the body of the toothbrush has found scratch marks too. I suspected the whole package was returned by the previous customer and resale to me as a brand new one. I am not too happy about it.</li>
    <li> I love the clean feeling this electric toothbrush gives, even better than Sonicare BUT as the battery runs down the toothbrush runs slower and slower and slower.  So I am severely shortening the battery life by recharging after every brush.  Braun needs to addres this problem and then this toothbrush would be a very very smart purchase.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing! My teeth are getting whiter with every brush. My gums would bleed with every brush with a normal toothbrush, but now after one week of using the OralB my gums don&#x27;t bleed anymore. I highly recommend this brush!</li>
    <li> I love this product!!! I like the different brushing options. The display makes it easy to use. Stays charged for days.</li>
    <li> My wife and I have tried several electric/battery toothbrush systems over the years and have been less than impressed. As a result, we have always reverted back to using manual toothbrushes. A few months ago she came home with an Oral-B Smartseries 5000 kit from our dentist.  She loved it, plus the kit had lots of extra brushes, free mouthwash, etc, etc. The rebates and offers brought the price down to about 1/2. A great deal. I was skeptical at first but after trying it for awhile I also was impressed. I ordered one and have been very pleased. So we now have one in each bathroom. This is the first toothbrush system we have been totally satisfied with.</li>
    <li> I have been using OralB electric toothbrushes for years.  My old one was getting long in the tooth(sorry about pun!) and running real slow, so I investigated buying a new one.  Since they were on a 50% rebate sale, i just bought the top of the line 5000 unit.  I could not be more pleased with how clean my teeth end up - I have never had a brush that cleans as well as this one; my hygienist will be so pleased!  I would like to expound on the advantages of this unit over the 4000 or 3000 in cleaning ability, but I have no idea, not having used the others.  If the only difference is gimmicks, then this unit is certainly full of them, and you might be just as pleased with a cheaper unit without the unnecessary gimmicks and modes.  One big con: there is a mode button to toggle through the 5 different modes that are built into this unit.  Most people, like me, will probably only use one mode, or at least will predominately use one mode.  The mode button is VERY poorly placed, in a very key position.  It is impossible to use this unit without accidentally hitting the mode key on a regular basis, if not every day.  Very annoying to have to figure out how to get back to your preferred mode.  They could not have chosen a poorer location for this if that was the goal.  Its like accidentally hitting the caps lock key on a laptop, for those who do not look at the screen while we type. What were they thinking, if they were thinking at all?  I like good design.  All the great design work that went into this - yet I would give them an &#x27;F&#x27; for failing on this, from the designer up to the CEO. It was just too big a mistake to be an oversight. A smaller con - the outlet plug is a huge unit that sticks straight out from the wall - takes up space and looks stupid - should have been flush.  Yet overall, I gave this 4 stars for the great cleaning and the rest of the design and charger.</li>
    <li> ISSUE 1: After 1st month using this toothbrush,the LED indicator screen started to act weird, sometimes no display, sometimes showing only the indicator for disabled radio signal. Also the Smart Guide doesn&#x27;t sync with the toothbrush, therefore it can&#x27;t provide your any indication to adjust your brushing pattern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ISSUE 2: The LED went from showing 3 battery bars to no display, and went dead in the middle of my brushing. I left the toothbrush in the charge station and checked on it hours later. it is still unresponsive, nothing on the LED screen on the brush except being tempered with water moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until now, I realized it is 100% designing flaw from Oralb because I experienced the same problem with my last 2 Oralb toothbrush. As the result, I will never purchase this product again until this issue is fixed in the future product.</li>
    <li> I have braces as an adult and its been fine in every aspect except for brushing my teeth. I was destroying regular brushes and not doing a great job.  A friend suggested the Oral-B and when Amazon had it on sale with the 50% rebate I jumped on it.  To be Honest, this is the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I have been using the floss head with the braces and my lord does it do a great job! My teeth feel like I just got out of the dentists office, and it gets anything out of my teeth that get stuck due to the braces.  Another huge plus is that its able to get in everywhere with hardly any pressure which is great because I had concerns about bleeding, plaque buildup + getting white streaks on my teeth.  Overall the Oral-B is easy to use, the silly little smiley face lets you know when the 2 minutes are up as well as the brush heads pulsing. I rinse off the unit and remove/rinse the head and keep it in the holder and everything stays nice and neat.  This is one of those gadgets that your unsure of buying, but once you take the plunge you&#x27;re very happy with your purchase because it just works great and is super easy to use.</li>
    <li> The wife and I wanted to start taking better care of our teeth and invest in a nice brush.  We decided on this after I did some research and found out it is a pretty good brush.  After using the brush for just 1 day my mouth felt much much cleaner.  Nearly like getting out of the dentist&#x27;s office.  The smart floss or whatever brush heads work great too.  I didn&#x27;t think they were working until my wife went to the dentist and they commended her on flossing.  She doesn&#x27;t floss!  The little timer tablet it comes with is nice too.  It tells you if you are brushing too hard (apparently I was almost all the time) and it times you so you brush for at least 2 minutes.  I thought it was gimmicky until I started doing it more.  I now actually brush for 2-3 minutes, I don&#x27;t even know how long I was brushing before but I know it wasn&#x27;t nearly that long.  I also like it because the wife and I can use the same main brush part and 2 different brush heads.  The travel case comes with slots to keep each brush head too so traveling is easy.  The brush keeps a charge for quite a while (not exactly sure how long since it sits on the charger most of the time).  If you travel you do not have to take the little monitor with you to keep track of brushing, the brush will pulse each 30 seconds to let you know to change the area of your mouth you are brushing and it will have several pulses at the end of the 2 minute mark.  You can also do a deep clean which it will time you for longer.  All in all I can honestly say I really enjoy this brush.  And I hated brushing my teeth.</li>
    <li> Nice product with nice features.  Our last Oral-B lasted for years and years, but finally the motor weakened.  As we searched for a replacement and read the reviews of the Smartseries 5000 this clearly had the features we thought we&#x27;d like and all for a decent price.  We&#x27;ve had this a few weeks and it works great.  The profile is smaller than the older model, which is appreciated, and the added features are as well.</li>
    <li> We have been using the Oral B products for years. Finally just needed to buy a new one.  The Pro 5000 is superior to our last one.  Better grip and on/off button configuration.  Also, the timer is actually fun.  Smiley face!!  Whodathought?</li>
    <li> I went to the dentist a while back and they mentioned that I should try out an electric toothbrush over the good ol&#x27; manual one I have used since I can remember. My first thought...you just want me to buy a $100+ toothbrush that works just as well as my one at home. Of course, like a fish attracted by something shiny I hopped on the internet to take a look at electric toothbrushes. I probably spent 5 hours reading everything I could on these. A lot of people were talking about the one that has a UV cleaner in it. I call gimmick. Anyways, I ended up with this one and was extremely skeptical.   1. The timer is separate from the brush and sits on your counter and has a picture of a smiling tooth on it, kind of hard not to feel like this is a joke  2. What the heck, charged this puppy up and waited till after dinner  3. Initiate brushing sequence  4. Having the handle buzz after 30 seconds to let you know to move to a new quadrant and having it show on the timer is very useful. It makes it seem like it is going by really fast.  5. If you brush too hard the handle stops pulsating till you back off. I literally put the brush head on each tooth and just move down, not really doing any real brushing but just letting the vibrations do the work.  6. After I spit and rinsed out my mouth, it literally felt like I just had my teeth cleaned by the dentist. They stay smooth almost the entire day depending on what you eat.  This was $$$ well spent in my opinion. I highly recommend getting one of these. Don&#x27;t forget, you are supposed to change your brush head every 3 months or so. Might want to price that into your purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  Especially the pauses to let you know that it&#x27;s time to move on to another quadrant.  There are more modes, but I like the standard one.  Great product for dental health!</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research on electrial toothbrushes and I decided to purchase this one, and boy I absolutely love it.  The battery life lasts quite a long time, the charger and toothbrush holder is not too bulky and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space. The toothbrush compartment has extra space for other brush heads to store. The toothbrush feels so good on my teeth and it&#x27;s nice that it has a built in timer so you can make sure you are brushing your teeth long enough. I love the fact that there are several different toothbrush heads you can change out if you like. The one&#x27;s I like are the pro-white polish and the floss brush head.  I want to try the clean brush head.  I love the travel case, so I can travel without bring the charger for an entire week and as long as my battery is fully charged it will last the entire week if not longer!!!  If you do purchase this amazing product it does take a full day to charge.  You will really like this toothbrush, I feel like my teeth get a better cleaning, you will not be disappointed!!!  Love it!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this electric toothbrush for over a week now and I&#x27;m very happy with it. At first I thought I would not use the timer but I find it quite helpful as I don&#x27;t have a clock nearby and its amazing how long or short 2 minutes is somedays.</li>
    <li> My dentist is much happier with me brushing with this brush than even with the AA battery oral B brushes.  I think it&#x27;s mostly because with the AA batty powered brushes the battery power reduces and I don&#x27;t notice?  Anyway: it&#x27;s nice because you can rinse out the head of the brush separately from the body to prevent water from sitting there and gook from growing.  And the carrying container is nice.  The price, of course, is high.  I got it on a goldbox deal.  I&#x27;m not sure what the lifetime is.</li>
    <li> Purchased this product along with the Philips Sonicare FlexCare Plus HX6972/10 Rechargeable Toothbrush for myself and my girlfriend.  I have owned each for about 8 months now and I have to say that each brush has its own pros/cons and this is her favorite.  The Oral-B is gentler and easier to use (difficult to use improperly), but tends to develop mess on the exterior/interior and is not as robust as the Sonicare.  The Sonicare does take some time to get use to and takes some adjustment on the part of the operator.  I found that my gums could handle the Sonicare, but my girlfriend gums are more sensitive and she uses this Oral-B exclusively.  The motion of the brush is much more softer and the replaceable brushes tend to fit right over each tooth.  I find that both brushes provide a comparable clean feel, but I tend to be hard on appliances and the Sonicare can take the abuse.  I like having the ability to brush my tongue which is much more difficult with this brush.</li>
    <li> This is the first and only electric toothbrush I bought. I bought it during one heck of a deal during thanksgiving in 2010 (just $35) and have been using it since. I like it a lot, but my wife found her teeth get more sensitive every time she used it. But I found it great and get a fresh feeling after using it. The SmartGuide is pretty cool too; you can control how long you brush your teeth - which is probably even more useful for kids. And I use it as a clock when not brushing my teeth.  But I do feel the brushheads to be somewhat expensive to replace...</li>
    <li> Nothing feels quite as good as clean teeth in the morning.  This brush is as close as going to the dentist as you get.  I use the floss action heads and it does a great job of cleaning your teeth as well as removing any film that makes your teeth feel dull.  I also love the display that shows how much time is left and whether you are brushing too hard.  My only complaint is that the battery has deteriorated greatly after only a year.  I conditioned the battery properly, so this really shouldn&#x27;t have happened.  The battery cannot be easily replaced, hence the full brush disposal instructions they give you.  I don&#x27;t consider a $100 toothbrush a yearly disposable item, but I guess oral-b does.  Still, the clean teeth feeling is worth it.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush is good as oral B is good. But few complains about this specific model 5000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The handle on 5000 is much bigger than on other similar toothbrushes. It is less comfortable to hold in hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The extra device coming with model 5000 is useless. It is supposedly an \\&quot;advanced\\&quot; timer which makes beeping noise when you need to switch sides of teeth to brush and when to stop brusing. I think, timers embedded in the toothbrush handle itself (what they do for less expensive models) do better job - there is absolutely no benefits to have timer separately (in addition it&#x27;s screen is hard to see).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3)The electric plug on this toothbrush is much longer than on other models. The base, though, is much smaller. Apparently they moved electronics from the base (where toothbrush stands) to the plug. It does not look good when plug is plugged in recepticle and it makes dificulties always to avoid pushing the plug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Another big complain - never received rebate. it was $50 rebate for this toothbrush when I bought it in August. I filled all forms and send them in. But, until today I do not have rebate. I opened case with amazon and will give you update if I get rebate eventually. I see these toothbrushes constantly going with rebates (there is $20 rebate now).</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is awesome.  I read other reviews about water leaking inside.  Well just do like I do... don&#x27;t get the anything except the brush head wet.  I have had mine for 8 months now and it works flawlessly.  It holds a charge for a long time.  It improved my gum health over a standard tooth brush.  There was a $50 rebate when I bought mine.  So, if you are thinking about waiting for a better price, it could happen.</li>
    <li> I have been using this toothbrush for about awhile now and I love this toothbrush. I wouldn&#x27;t pay 100 something dollars for a toothbrush but since Oral B had a 50 percent rebate I jumped at the chance to buy this toothbrush. It promotes positive teeth brushing and even gives you a smiley face after you are done for a job well done. After awhile my teeth feel cleaner and breathe is fresher. I like how it is waterproof so I can take it in the shower with me to brush my teeth and the travel case is a nice addition too. If you are looking for a toothbrush then look no further this is the one for you.     My only grip is how expensive the brushes are I always try and look for specials or deals so I don&#x27;t end up spending to much per a brush head. I also feel the battery life on mine doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like it to. I think on a full charge the battery light would flash after a week and a half which i feel is a little to short but its not a big deal. Get this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Per a recommendation from my dentist, I puchased this toothbrush.  After a couple months of use, it has met all of my expectations.  I have definitely seen an overall improvement around the gum line (a problem area), and although I freely admit I could probably achieve the same results with more concentrated manual brushing, this brush makes it easy.  To early to comment on durabilty, etc. but battery life has been approx. a week between charges, which is nice.  The separate monitor is a nice feature, athough I admittedly use more as a clock than a monitor as to how long i&#x27;ve brushed.  All in all, I am pleased with my purchase.  A quick word on the \\&quot;Frustration Free Packaging\\&quot;... it rocks!  Open a carbbord box and you&#x27;re ready to plug in the charger and seat the handle.</li>
    <li> for the 4 months i was using it, i totally loved it.   then the LED screen started to act up. 1st, no display, subsequently the battery indicator on the led returned, but only as 3 bars.  finally, it died in the middle of my brushing.  called Oral B, thankfully, they are sending a replacement. but there is a 10min wait on the customer service hotline for a representative.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve had previous Oral-B electric toothbrushes that were more of the lower models. Those do not even compare to this one. Highly recommend anyone thinking of upgrading to dive in. This one tracks how long to brush each quadrant and the motor seems much stronger than our previous Oral-B toothbrushes and does a better job cleaning. Also with the container included you only need one toothbrush for the entire household.</li>
    <li> Having had an Oral-B electric toothbrush for years and liking it, I was looking to get another Oral B when the time came to replace it. I decided on this model because it had the separate timer - something I had come to really miss on my older model. It had the timer on the handle only, making it impossible to check during operation. And while it buzzed after each 30-second segment was up, I often didn&#x27;t really remember whether it had already buzzed to signal that the full two minutes had been reached and kept brushing longer than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it turned out that the separate timer on the Oral-B 5000 is all around tedious to operate. First, one has to remove the timer stand, then the battery cover because the buttons to set the timer are hidden underneath the cover. Whether this was a misguided attempt at keeping the design minimalist I don&#x27;t know. But having to fumble with this already didn&#x27;t work for me - I can&#x27;t help but wonder: What were they thinking?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, the timer never worked anyway - it is set to demo mode when one takes it out of the box, and the buttons in the battery compartment also serve to set it up for regular operation. Trouble was that my timer could not be reset to normal operation. It kept cycling through demo mode time and again until I gave up and returned the whole thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the toothbrush itself, it seemed to work great, just as I was used to from the previous model (and the only reason I gave this 3 stars at all). But since I had gotten this particular one because of the timer, I decided to order the 4000 model instead and just put up with the timer in the handle - at least I know this will work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last word: My old Oral-B toothbrush came with a nice, very sturdy fabric case. This one in contrast has a rather flimsy plastic travel case. Another disappointment. My conclusion: Too expensive for what it offers.</li>
    <li> I found a good coupon to save money on this electric toothbrush, and the hygenist at my last Dentist appointment suggested I look at one to be able to reach my molars.  I will never return to a normal brush now.  My teeth feel \\&quot;left the dentist clean\\&quot; each day, and this toothbrush makes it easy to brush the \\&quot;right amount\\&quot; (the instruction manual says that dentists recommend spending 2 minutes brushing your teeth each time).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a Braun electric toothbrush for many years and have always been satisfied with the results. The reviews and the rebate attracted me to the Oral-B Smartseries 5000. I especially liked the polishing mode, since I drink a lot of tea which stains teeth. I didn&#x27;t think that I&#x27;d use the clock/timer/sensor, but I decided to put it up to have a small clock in my bathroom. I&#x27;m using it all of the time! I give my teeth a \\&quot;spa treatment\\&quot; - floss, polish, massage gums...and feel like I&#x27;ve had a professional cleaning. Having always been a diligent brusher, I was surprised to see that I could benefit from the reminder to brush each of the four areas for 30 seconds. The little warning light that tells me when I&#x27;m exerting pressure (and thus brushing too hard - all you have to do is hold the brush up to the surface of the tooth and let it do the cleaning) is useful for breaking a bad habit that seems to crop up in the same place quite often.I even like the smiley face as a reward for good brushing, although I usually tend to be rather jaded about such things. I think that I&#x27;ll be sticking with Oral-B from now on. And I&#x27;m also glad for the travel case since I hated to make trips without my Bruan (you just can&#x27;t got back to manual brushing after you&#x27;re brushed this well), but I&#x27;d find that the \\&quot;on\\&quot; button sometimes got pressed in my luggage and used up the charge. The base for the Oral-B is also small enough to pack easily.</li>
    <li> I have had this toothbrush since October 2010. I am obsessed with using it, for the FULL two minutes because of the just-been-to-the-dentist feel. I opted for the 55000 for the \\&quot;gimmicky\\&quot; timer which I absolutely love. When I travel I leave the timer at home and I always forget how long I&#x27;ve been brushing. Is that vibrate the 2nd...or 3rd one? I can never remember because I usually try to do something else as I&#x27;m brushing my teeth. So, for me, I love the timer.     I love the feel of the 5000 over the 4000 (I bought my mom the 4000 for Christmas and she bought my Dad the same one).     I always use the Floss Action head, it&#x27;s by far my favorite.     I was hoping this toothbrush would be a little quieter than it is but it&#x27;s not outrageously loud. We have a master en-suite and with the bathroom door closed all the way and the rest of the house silent you can hear the toothbrush in the bedroom but it&#x27;s not loud enough to wake my husband or myself up.    I do share the handle of this toothbrush with my husband. Like some other reviewers have mentioned our battery life is not so great anymore. We can \\&quot;justbarely\\&quot; make it a week without having to recharge. It takes about 8-9 hours to charge fully.     My biggest complaint is that within the last few weeks the red light on the timer (pressure sensing light) is almost continually on when we are using the toothbrush. I do need to find the manual and see if there&#x27;s a way for us to calibrate or reset something. The toothbrush is still operating fine but I&#x27;m afraid this issue is a sign of an impending serious malfunction.</li>
    <li> Rarely have I been impressed by some of the electric toothbrushes I have used.  I&#x27;ve tried a few inexpensive battery operated toothbrushes and an early generation SonicCare system. Although, they were adequate, with the [[ASIN:B004O76DEC Oral-B Smartseries 5000 Professional Care Rechargeable, White/Silver]] model, I was able to tell a difference after the first few uses.  I was amazed by the smooth look and feel of my teeth.  It was able to remove stains on my teeth, resulting in visibly more white teeth.  I was able to easily reach and clean the back molars which are extremely difficult for manual toothbrushes, even for the more persistent tooth cleaners.  My manual toothbrush has been retired, as owning this has made a huge difference!  The 60 day guarantee is nice if you are on the fence, but my 6 day trial has been more than enough to convince me!</li>
    <li> Have always brushed my teeth the old fashion way-manually. I thought I would get into the 21st century and get an electric toothbrush. This product does the job. It tells me where I should brush and makes sure that I do it for the appropriate time. I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> the brush is fine, it seems to work.  But the smart guide unit came with batteries inside, plus an extra two in a small plastic bag. just a bit suspicious it was a refurbished item. It makes you doubt the rest of the unit, are you getting also a used handle? That is not a nice image to have:  Not knowing where your brush handle has been.  2 minutes signal is ok and the brush itself signals every 30 seconds.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush.  It feels comfortable in my hand and the brush head is small enough to feel comfortable in my mouth while allowing me to get the brush to where I need to.  I love the timer disguised as a clock. I tend to press too hard with the toothbrush and now I get reminded to lighten up when I get heavy handed. My old electric toothbrush was way too old, too big, and very awkward to use. With this toothbrush the two minutes zip right by and my teeth feel really clean. I am ordering the flossing and polishng heads, then I will really want to flash those \\&quot;pearly whites\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I previously owned a Oral-B Professional toot brush (Costco version).  I liked the brush and its results on my teeth very much and once my old brush started to loose charge fast after 3 years of use I wanted to replace it with another Oral-B toothbrush. I saw this new version at my dentist. It mostly has the same features my old brush had but I was intrigued by the wireless display and its pressure sensor indicator, as I was worried I might press too hard when brushing. My old brush had a mechanism where the pulsating stops when you press too hard and you were supposed to notice a change in the sound the brush makes. I thought I give this new brush a try for its potentially more precise pressure detector. It turns out I either brush my teeth with ok pressure or the pressure detection isn&#x27;t more precise. I have to press  very hard for the pressure sensor to go off.   I can see how some people find the wireless display a fun toy and I have heard some find themselves brushing longer and more conisstently with it. To me the wireless display seems like a not very useful toy and I should have bought a cheaper version of this brush, without the wireless sensor. The Oral-B 1000 [[ASIN:B003UKM9CO Oral-B 1000 Professional Care 1000 Electric Toothbrush, White and Blue]] has all the features I need, and more, w/o the wireless sensor, and costs about 1/2 of this one. Costco has a great deal on their 2-pack if you can use two brushes in your household.  Every couple of months there is a Costco coupon and then those two brushes will cost about 30% than the 5000 brush here.   Otherwise I&#x27;m as happy with the brush results with this brush as I was with my old one.</li>
    <li> I regret buying in.  While it worked, it was great.  But its been 18 months and it will no longer charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to replace it with the model that costs $12 and takes normal batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the sanyo eneloop recharable batteries for the kids toys and they generally are fantastic.  I plan to use those instead and to avoid all products that come with their own custom, non replaceable batteries in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully I&#x27;ll have more luck.</li>
    <li> Having gone through some gum problems my dentist recommended the Oral B.  It is the best electric toothbrush I have ever used.  The ability to select the mode, sensitive for me, has provided the better cleaning without worrying about damage to my gums.  I can feel how clean my teeth are after daily brushing.</li>
    <li> I got this unit to replace and old (7 years) and dying Oral-b. This one is much more improved and after using it the first time my wife said it was the say a going to the dentist hygenist. The new brushes for plaque and the whitening cup really do the job. I also did not think I would use the timer but now count on it for a proper brushing. The storage tray for the brushes with the dust top is a nice touch as well. I also upgraded due to loss of benefits and having to cut down on dentist visits so this unit will help maintain tooth care between visits.</li>
    <li> I bought this a very long time ago.  Why is the review just turning up, now?  I love the rechargeable Oral-B .  It is the best electric toothbrush out there.  This is my 2nd one.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> I love this thing! Its the coolest thing to get to brush your teeth! I hated to brush my teeth before I got this but now! I love it!</li>
    <li> We bought this toothbrush as a replacement for Sonicare. The problem with Sonicare was durability (that was less than 2 years on average) and high cost. But I should say that when (once) it died during first year, it took one phone call to get replacement.&lt;br /&gt;Oral-B looked better per reviews and also it had cheaper replacement heads. So, we decided to give a try.&lt;br /&gt;As a toothbrush, it works differently from Sonicare and at the beginning we liked it quite more. But after a while, I&#x27;m not sure which one I like more. In either case, it does job done. I would not suggest buying the fancy timer though.&lt;br /&gt;However, this one died in a half a year. By itself, one sample is not a statistic. But customer support was quite less friendly and we had to ship the toothbrush with papers for \\&quot;repair\\&quot;. At the end, we&#x27;ve got a new one - but is was much more painful.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I would rate the toothbrush about the same as Sonicare, quite worth customer support and (so far) same poor reliability. If this one will die within next year or two, I probably will switch back to Phillips.</li>
    <li> Great brush. Holds a charge for a long time. A bit pricey.  Look for a promo code from the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> Not going to go over features since you can all read on other reviews. But this thing works great! My dentist congratulated me twice on my check ups</li>
    <li> Three years later, still love this thing!</li>
    <li> Still going after two years and two users.</li>
    <li> As expected, no complaints.</li>
    <li> I have had this toothbrush for about 6 months now and I would recommend it to anyone considering.  I didn&#x27;t realize how hard I was brushing my teeth before but now I get the little red light on the clock/timer if I push too hard.  My gums NEVER bleed anymore, my teeth are so much whiter, and my mouth just feels cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;Mine stays charged very well.  I charge it overnight once ever 9 or 10 days after brushing my teeth for 2.5 min twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;I really like the clock too! :)</li>
    <li> I tried an electric toothbrush a few years back and could not stand the vibration so stopped using after a couple   of times.  I decided to try it again thinking that improved technology might make it bearable.  This one comes with a  timer so you know how long you brush each quadrant of your mouth.  Two minutes is what is recommended by dentist, I can go over 4 minutes and longer when I have time.  My teeth feel so clean and appear whiter after each use.  I   have only been using it for a week but have no plans on giving it up any time soon.:-) I would definitely recommend   this product!</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product! I&#x27;m finding it impossible to find genuine replacement heads. Do a search for fake oral b brush heads and you&#x27;ll see this is a huge issue.</li>
    <li> Oral B is an excellent product. I have purchased all of my family one. Easy to take with you on a trip. Amazon has good prices.</li>
    <li> Excellent toothbrush, but save your money by skipping the extra gadgets.  Just the charger and brush are all you need. Gadget is impossible to use properly. The small charger travels well.</li>
    <li> great item if you want to be precise , excellent charge, small, simple,easy to fit anywhere, and it gets the job done right.</li>
    <li> Very nice brush. Teeth feel clean, it was easier than normal to floss (it loosened plaque?)    NiMH battery, so it will need to be discharged for \\&quot;memory effect\\&quot; occasionally.    Instructions are ridiculous. This is what you do: Remove clock from the plastic holster. Remove cover from clock (may need pressure). Replace batteries. Hold down SET and change the time as standard.    The electronic timer seems useless. Save money and don&#x27;t waste more plastic on the extra clock. All it does is show a timer. The brush slows down after the recommended 2 minutes anyway, it&#x27;s not like you won&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> I Use This Toothbrush Twice A Day Well Made And Clock Is A Great Plus, The Cost Of Replacement Brushes Are In Line With Regular Toothbrushes, For The Price You Can&#x27;t Go Wrong, I Got This One From Amazon.com Prime Free Shipping &amp; No Sales Tax What A Deal, That Is Why I Gave It Five Stars</li>
    <li> Since purchasing this toothbrush, I actually want to brush my teeth more often! My whole mouth feels incredibly clean after each use. I love it and recommend it to anyone who wants to prevent cavities!</li>
    <li> Everything as advertised and more. this a wonderful product...leaves you feeling that you just had your teeth cleaned at the Dentist! [[ASIN:B004O76DEC Oral-B Smartseries 5000 Professional Care Rechargeable, White/Silver]]</li>
    <li> With the money that you pay for this you will receive a nice one.  The package came very fast, and so far I didn&#x27;t have any problem with my brush.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric toothbrush and I absolutely Love it! I would recommend this product to anyone. Very easy to use, and rather fun :)</li>
    <li> i purchased this a while back and loved it for about 2 weeks... i have always used sonicare in the past and it was nice to try something else.  long story short i stopped using this and went back to manual!  the sonicare is SO much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after a while of using my manual brush i when and purchased a new sonicare.</li>
    <li> Since my husband had recently purchased the Oral B Smartseries I was using his and loved it. Felt it gave a deeper cleaning than my Sonicare. When I saw the 50% rebate was available again I immediately ordered my own. (I guess I was too lazy twice a day to keep changing the brushes to my own and I was afraid over time I may damage it)  The brush is excellent. Mouth feels so clean afterwards. Love the clock that comes with it.</li>
    <li> I needed to replace a 10 year old Oral B electronic toothbrush. I picked this one because it had the timer, hard brushing alert and other users rated it highly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazingly, I had to read the book on a toothbrush but it paid off. The unit is an aggressive toothbrush and does a much better job in the 2 minutes it takes versus 3 minutes on the old one. The timer is cute but probably not essential. I like to take 2.5 minutes versus the 2 minutes it suggests.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush head has a more varied profile and seems to get in places the old one didn&#x27;t. The brush cycle is more aggressive and \\&quot;feels\\&quot; like it is doing a better job, although I am a little worried it might be too strong. You can reset it to a more gentle pattern and several different head styles are available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only way I could get the Hard brushing alert to kick in was to push very hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The travel case came in handy right away and it the tooth brush worked for a week on the road without a charge.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush has made brushing fun. The timer helps me brush all four quadrants of my mouth equally. It&#x27;s especially good at brushing my wisdom teeth.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this brush. I love it! i love brushing my teeth now! The timer is very handy. It holds a charge for a couple-few days if you&#x27;re traveling.</li>
    <li> Love the fit and finish, feels like quality in your hands. The added display module is also built very well. Works great, the icons help with brushing.&lt;br /&gt;Easy clean-up. Over all a winner and worth the huge price of one hundred dollars. Also now I have a much needed unobtrusive bathroom clock&lt;br /&gt;so I am not late. Oral-B gives you two sets of batteries and two brushes. A Winner for this guy.</li>
    <li> We went on a trip recently and took our old Braun electric toothbrush after having this one for a few months, and it was like going back to a hand powered brush!  This is SO thorough yet gentle.  Another feature I like is the pulsing every 30 seconds.  It is supposed to be for those who divide their brushing between 4 sections of the mouth, upper left, upper right, lower left, lower right. Since I like to do the back side of my front teeth together, instead I took the first 30 second pulse as, \\&quot;Ok, you&#x27;re halfway through the top,\\&quot; and the second as a cue to move to the bottom.  It&#x27;s amazing, how much I had to force myself to stay on the top a full minute.  I didn&#x27;t even realize I was brushing the lower teeth more.  I recently had a cleaning where I was told my upper back teeth had more plaque than lower. Now I know why!  This will keep you even in your brushing time throughout your mouth, feel great, give you a terrific clean, yet be gentle.   I was SO pleased that I got one for my hubby.  We have separate bathrooms, or could have easily shared the handle.  He didn&#x27;t do the full two minutes on our old version, but on this one he is.  I think it is the continual prompts that make the brushing time seem faster.  Very impressed. So glad we got them!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my hubby.  He really likes it.  He says it works well and is easy to use.  It arrived promptly and works well- that&#x27;s all we wanted. :)</li>
    <li> This does a fantastic job of cleaning your teeth.  The only other electric toothbrushes I have used have been lower end models and they are not even in the same league as this toothbrush.  I use this with the Floss Action brush heads and my teeth feel great after.  I bought this when Oral-B was having a 50% rebate so I paid only $50 for it.  Killer deal at that price.  The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because the 4000 series is a much better buy.  It is definitely not worth it to pay any extra for the stupid Wireless SmartGuide; it&#x27;s completely useless. Go with the 4000 which is the same unit and you will be much happier.</li>
    <li> i really like this toothbrush. I brush my teeth for longer with the wifi unit because it smiles after 3minutes to let you know you&#x27;ve finished. Who doesn&#x27;t like a good smile?</li>
    <li> A fantastic toothbrush, cleverly designed to maximize optimal brushing. It has several types of cleaning, timer for each quadrant of the mouth and an easy to use system. As a previously sceptical electric toothbrush customer I am totally sold on this one. You won&#x27;t regret purchasing this.</li>
    <li> My dentist had recommended this to me, and was selling it for way more than I got it on Amazon. Since using this toothbrush, my hygienist tells me that she really hasn&#x27;t much to do in my mouth. I even use this on my greyhounds. (different spin brush ) and their teeth are nice and plaque free. I love this toothbrush. It&#x27;s so easier than a manual. Maybe I&#x27;m just lazy, but, my own brushing no matter how long  I brush, can&#x27;t match this, especially when both the Dentist and hygienist are telling me that I spend less time in the dentist&#x27;s chair.</li>
    <li> We have been using this brush for a while now. I wanted to wait before writing this review, as so many users tend to rush before letting the product prove itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s proved itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a five star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does exactly what it says it does. No surprises.</li>
    <li> I have owned this toothbrush for about a year now and it is hands down the best electric toothbrush on the market. I was a Sonicare user for about six or seven years before switching to Oral B, and Oral B just provides you a more thorough and complete cleaning experience. I read a lot of reviews saying that brush heads for Oral B were people with bigger mouths, but I feel I was able to reach the teeth in the back of mouth better with the Oral B than with Sonicare. This version has the most features, although you can probably get by with one of the cheaper versions. Overall this tooth brush is a great investment for improving and maintaining your oral hygiene.</li>
    <li> Purchased: September 2011&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Malfunctioned: July 2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, worked very well and was durable through routine home use as well as through travel by air, sea and land over nearly 3 years of use. Retained charge initially for up to a week with brushing twice daily. I really didn&#x27;t use the multiple modes of head speed and rhythms beyond the first month of &amp;#34;trying it out&amp;#34; out of curiousity. I settled on a constant speed mode (1st setting i believe). The wireless display was initially cool, but I stopped using after the first year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did it make a dental health difference?  Yes, I believe so. Since commencing use of product my routine dental cleanings have been fairly fast and uneventful.  Indeed, at one point I wondered if the dental hygienist was exercising due diligence so I rotated through a few other dental hygienists (in 3 dental offices) over the years and it was basically the same experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How did it stop working? The product gradually lost its &amp;#34;umph!&amp;#34;  That is, lost RPMs. When in contact with teeth, it would grind to a near halt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did it meet my expectations? Yes, partially.  Met expectations in terms of performance. In terms of longevity, I would have liked for it to last a bit longer (5 year longetivity would be nice).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend to others? Yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I purchase again?  Uncertain. Now that I&#x27;m in the market for another electric toothbrush, I&#x27;m curious about the options.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  I have waited too long to buy one like this, it works wonderfully. However, the problem I have with it is the directions for using the timer.  It is way too hard to understand, and I am not uneducated!!  I also took this to my neighbor that is a computer whiz and he gave up too!!!   I can&#x27;t find a number to call to talk to anyone (no customer service number), So the moral of the story is for the price and the product itself it is great, if you need the timer, forget it and look for another product.   If the seller is reading this review I would appreciate an e-mail from you to tell me how to work this timer?   The product came very quickly, and well packaged, I am pleased with the seller, I only want some way to contact them, or the manufacturing company about this product.   I have read the booklet that came with it and it doesn&#x27;t have a telephone number to call that answers the phone and I have called and called.  I really do love the toothbrush though, it makes my teeth feel soooo clean and promotes healty gums too!</li>
    <li> I always have hand brushed my teeth 2x a day and felt lke it was one of lifes chores. I have found lately, that good job I thought I was doing brushing was not so good. I began to have MANY issues with my teeth. My dentist told me I was brushing incorrectly and not long enough, and also suggested the electric brush as an easy way to fix the problem. Some of my friens already had this brush and highly recommended it. Now with the new easy to use brush I have noticed a new willingness to brush and also can tell I have whiter teeth and healthier gums to boot. I give this product a big thumbs up!</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t have one of these you definitely need one. It will clean your teeth and not do damage to your gums like a manual toothbrush. The charge lasts at least 10 days and the feedback display is nice when you are learning to use it in the first few months.</li>
    <li> Since there&#x27;s no point in repeating what others have said, let me just add that the on-wall clock/timer unit would be infinitely more useful if it would connect to a WiFi network and let me upload my own Java apps to it like an Android phone.  Then I could alter the behavior so that the timer takes into account that I need time to rearm the brush with toothpaste between sides.  I could also adjust the timer so that it tells me to switch quadrants after each minute rather than 30 seconds.  Heck, I could do a whole bunch of useful things with the timer unit if I could install my own apps on it.  Definitely a wasted opportunity as the timer unit is only good for maintaining discipline and encouraging kids as it is now.  Still, this is a fine product.</li>
    <li> likes:&lt;br /&gt;  feedback on the lcd screen is useful&lt;br /&gt;  different modes for brushing, polishing, massaging, feather, regular, etc.&lt;br /&gt;  easy to reach with small brush head&lt;br /&gt;dislikes:&lt;br /&gt;  hard to keep the brash head clean&lt;br /&gt;  hard to change the batteries on the lcd feedback display&lt;br /&gt;  the clock on the lcd display is always fast :(&lt;br /&gt;  the battery on the brush handle drains faster than sonic care handle&lt;br /&gt;  i need to keep charging every three days or so&lt;br /&gt;overall:&lt;br /&gt;  almost 50% off with the mail in rebate&lt;br /&gt;  toothbrush itself - great deal with the mail in rebate&lt;br /&gt;would i buy it again?&lt;br /&gt;  yes, with the mail in rebate&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#####&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;APR 16, 2012&lt;br /&gt;The battery does not keep the charge as long as it used to.&lt;br /&gt;It does not clean as much compared to Sonic Care.&lt;br /&gt;I might be switching back to Sonic Care after the last brush head is gone.</li>
    <li> I love clean, white teeth and really take care of my oral hygene.  I do like the Professional Care SmartSeries 5000 Electric Rechargeable Power Toothbrush.  Your teeth really do feel as clean as if you just came from the dentist&#x27;s office.  I like the 2-minute clock to keep you brushing longer. The real test will come at my next dental appointment to find out the condition of my teeth and gums.  I have only one negative comment; I can never use the first speed option as it is too fast for my sensitive teeth.  The second option speed is better for me.  Otherwise it&#x27;s a great product!  Jeannie</li>
    <li> I previously had 2 rotadent toothbrushes I purchased from my dentist and both died in 6 months.  I have problems with brushing my teeth too hard, even using the softest manual toothbrushes.  This brush is awesome, you can&#x27;t brush too hard because it will stop working if you do and my teeth are so much cleaner even flossing is much better.  This is the BMW of toothbrushes in my opinion.  And my dental hygenist appreciates my cleaner teeth when I go for routine cleanings. Buy it, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> Would not buy this more expensive model again.  Used a Sonic automatic toothbrush before and much prefer it.  However, when it stopped working after four years, had to replace it.  The head on this model is not comfortable in the mouth (the back of the head of the toothbrush has a very rough surface on it that can be abrasive to the buccal mucosa and your lips so if you have sensitive lips/tissue in your mouth, do NOT purchase this one.  Supposedly it tells you when you are brushing too hard but I am not sure because I pretty much dislike the feel of this toothbrush in my mouth (very uncomfortable) and I think I am probably not brushing as long.  There is the little device that you sit beside it that times it.  NOW, do you have alot of space on your sink counter because the toothbrush AND the timer take up much more space that other models so if you don&#x27;t want alot of crap sitting on the counter and/or don&#x27;t want to have to buy/replace extra batteries, get the Sonic which has a built in beep when you have brushed for 30 seconds.  I think this separate timer is just hoopla to make you think you are getting a superior toothbrush OR the developers forgot to put a timer INTO the toothbrush itself.  I also don&#x27;t find this brushhead to be as comfortable as the sonic (it is bulkier, feels stiffer, and is rounded instead of the usual toothbrush shape).  I may purchase another sonic even though I already spent too much money on this inferior product just because I find myself either brushing my teeth less with this rather painful toothbrush (after the first few uses, I got a cold sore where the toothbrush was abrading my lips) OR using my manual toothbrush which defeats the purpose.  I would not recommend this to ANYONE and cannot think of another purpose for it.  At least, with the equally inferior waterpik I just got, I think I can clean jewelry with that.  Have to be creative to think of what to do with this toothbrush because it is not very good for brushing teeth.  To clean something that has rusted- maybe old hardware or something.  I&#x27;ll figure it out.</li>
    <li> After listening to all of my friends switch to electric toothbrushes, I finally decided to make the plunge. Based on the widely positive reviews of this model, I purchased it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first week was rough. My gums and teeth weren&#x27;t used to that level of attention and cleaning, and it showed. It was embarrassing to realize how poorly I had been cleaning my teeth before I bought this toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it every day for 2 years, and my teeth are whiter than they&#x27;ve ever been. My dentist has less to clean, my teeth look healthier, and best of all -- it&#x27;s less effort for me! I actually have gotten pretty good at brushing with one hand and playing with my phone with the other! Talk about multitasking. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only real downside of an electric toothbrush over a normal one is the cost of replacement heads. Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save program is great for this, and I&#x27;d highly recommend it. With this program, replacement heads are about the same cost as a normal toothbrush, so the regular maintenance cost is about the same as before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 2 years, the toothbrush still holds a great charge. I can take it with me on trips for 2-3 weeks and not have to worry about bringing the charger.</li>
    <li> Great Gift and Product. Perfect for the person that travels. Would highly recommend even if you weren&#x27;t traveling, it is made well and does all that it is suppose to do.</li>
    <li> Manual brushes should be left in the 1800&#x27;s. This cleans better and prevents you from brushing too hard by a warning on the screen and it stops too. It helps me brush for the recommended 2 min. Had this for years and no problems. Save your gums and get the Oral -B</li>
    <li> I bought this toothbrush because it was one of the few that had the ability to be charged by US electrical standards and UK which is a higher voltage.  It works very well, I love the brush. I&#x27;m giving it one less star because the coffin shaped travel box is HUGE.  I have an older Oral-B brush and it&#x27;s box is much smaller.  Why would you make a travel case with so much wasted space, it&#x27;s beyond me especially when the older model had a smaller case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the best features is the smaller brush head really gets behind your back teeth quite well if you don&#x27;t have wisdom teeth.  Make sure you buy Oral-B brand brush heads as replacements, they are pricey but I tried the off brand and they were complete rubbish!</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed in the rebate policy.  I purchased two of these products.  I received a rebate refusal back reflecting that you could only get one rebate per household.  Had I known this I probably would have purchased only one.  Does not seem to make business sense to discourage buyers from buying more than one product...</li>
    <li> The Sonicare brush is a better product which I still use.  The wife likes this Oral-B better.  The timer with the Oral-B is a mystery to operate.  Wife always would bear down too hard when using the Sonicare, wearing out the brushes faster and not cleaning teeth as well.  The Oral-B is supposed to have a warning if bearing down too hard.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush, but I will never understand the thought process behind the design of the power adapter. Why does it have to stick so far out?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife and I use different heads with the same brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> 130 $ for a toothbrush and after two months of using just cannot recharge battery anymore...it is still brand new and only I can do is to trash it...really disappointed...</li>
    <li> It was the very toothbrush I wanted, the best there is in the market nowadays, and I got it at Amazon for half the price than the very factory sells it in Germany!  It does all it says it does and is just plain fantastic!</li>
    <li> Awesome tooth brush for the whole family .. I use this brush with replaceable tips for myself and two boys .. Color coordinated tips make everything easy to share</li>
    <li> I am not sure if somebody got paid to say wonderful things about this product on this site. I just got my product in hand and for the price, it does what it promises. It is a big disappointment that it is not dual voltage and I cannot go on longer trips even with a charger as I was hoping to do. I know how to brush my teeth, so the extra plate is of little value. I also do not really like a plate telling me to replace my brush heads.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t last forever, I need a replacement, wish they put a date on here as to when I purchased this</li>
    <li> if you want to better clean your teeth you should have this. of course you can do it manually but this device will save time and efford on the same process. my whife broke the wrist and i bought it to her to brush easier with the other hand. she can&#x27;t live without it anymore</li>
    <li> I have used this electric toothbrush for about 5 years. I really like it. Haven&#x27;t had any cavities since i started using it. Thanks.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush does everything but hold the brush.  It tells you how long to brush and where to brush. It&#x27; wonderful.</li>
    <li> got this product b/c my gums were a bit inflamed and bleeding. Went to the dentist and was told I wasn&#x27;t cleaning my teeth well enough. Of course, I thought I was.  I remembered my sibling raving about the Oral B Professional toothbrush, so I took the plunge.&lt;br /&gt;The first few days, I followed the instructions and timer exactly as it says to do.  I can tell you that I WASN&#x27;T cleaning my teeth adequately before. The Oral-B cleans 1000 times better and my gums are back to normal now.  It is the best $ you&#x27;ll ever spend on preventative maintenance for you teeth/gums.</li>
    <li> Still works after so many years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for about a year and am still very pleased with it. I often take it on trips in the included traveling case and have found that it can go without charging for up to 14 days (though I rarely push it past 10). While I initially used the Oral-B Professional Floss Action brush heads, I&#x27;ve recently switched to the Oral-B DualAction Premium Power Toothbrush Head and have been even more satisfied with how clean my mouth feels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be the first to admit that I love gadgets, so I was a-okay with paying extra to get the wireless Smart Guide – that said, I&#x27;ve found it surprisingly useful! I was unaware of how hard I sometimes pushed while brushing, and it&#x27;s been a reliable way to monitor my brushing habits.</li>
    <li> Ordered this toothbrush because a friend in the dental field used it. I LOVE IT. My whole family has now purchased them. It holds a charge for several days, it ensures that you brush long enough, and gives the feeling of leaving the dentists office. You dont have to have the screen for the timer either, the toothbrush will vibrate when you need to change quadrants and will vibrate multiple times when 2 minutes is up.</li>
    <li> It was both informative and a truly entertaining life and human relations story.  I purchased copies for each of my three sisters.</li>
    <li> Super nice item, my wife loves it!</li>
    <li> My wife and I each have one of these toothbrushes and they work fine.  I purchased one as a birthday gift for my daughter.  She was able to use it for a few weeks until it became intermittent and useless.  It cycles off and on during use.&lt;br /&gt;So, poor quality.  We will replace with another brand.</li>
</ol>
